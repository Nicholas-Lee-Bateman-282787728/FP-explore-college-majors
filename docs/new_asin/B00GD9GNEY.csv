6071968,1,B00GD9GNEY,"DC-Warner does it again. Another Justice League feature with no Aquaman. The entire New 52 Justice League  story served to reintroduced the chartered characters of the League, including Aquaman, now one major player in DC line-up  of main characters. Sorry, this one is a no buy for me.",1388793600,5,286,4.9375
6071969,3,B00GD9GNEY,"I've been a comic books collector for the majority of my life (I'm 37). Most of the comics I love are from DC. I never really liked Marvel that much. In saying this, I loved all of the DCU original movies. I owned all of them and I will definitely buy this one, just because. This movies are great and Marvel Universe might dominate DC on the live action films, but on the animated front DC is way above Marvel. They're currently releasing 3 animated films a year and very good quality, with stories that we fans like. Stories based on the source material. In saying this, the reason of my poor review is only based on the fact that they did not include Aquaman in this story, they decided to replace him with Shazam!. Not that I don't like Shazam, it's just that he wasn't in the original New 52 Justice League origin story from 2011. I would have loved that they had Aquaman in this to use the opportunity to boost the popularity of this character, which is in fact one of my favorite (you can insult me here....). Other than that I think it will be great addition to my collection.",1388620800,10,1084,4.318627450980392
6071970,1,B00GD9GNEY,"Nothing about the new 52 is appealing. They have completely destroyed many of the characters I grew up with. The stories are increasingly lacking. Seeing these characters in the recent trailer for this film, just makes my heart sad.",1387411200,17,232,4.9743589743589745

6071972,1,B00GD9GNEY,"As the owner of my own video rental business I have had to make adjustments to my business practices to stay afloat during these uncertain economic times.  One of the major changes I recently had to make due to all the wonderful Obamacare(s) regulations was to reduce the documented working hours for a large portion of my staff. Most of the kids had families to support since their parents had not become citizens or at most legal residents of this country. Frequently, those parents would lend their kids to work for me as I see fit for an indeterminate amount of time in exchange for various goods and services.  I use ""indeterminate"" because there are times when the parents go missing and so the kids will continue working for me as they have nowhere else to go. Reporting them to the local authorities would only hurt my business.
Enter my video business. The store front for my many other business endeavors.  People go online to rent a movie and the kids will deliver it to them in the area via moped, bicycle, skateboard or on foot.  Having such a business as this has enabled me to gain access to many movies before they are actually released to the general public.
Such as the case with this particular movie ""Justice League War.""
Not really being able to differentiate between Justice League, Youngblood, Avengers or even the Planeteers,  I feel I would be amiss to provide a thorough and fair review of this movie, but I am confident, there will be two-thousand or more that will feel enlightened enough to take on such a task. As to who reads or even cares about all those reviews, it is beyond me.
Besides, I will hold out for the Blu-ray version of this movie for a far superior picture and sound.",1386806400,7,1713,4.5667752442996745

6071990,4,B00GD9GNEY,"Shazam replaces Aquaman, but other than that, it sticks pretty close to the source material.

Some people have said they don't like the voice actors, but I'm okay with each generation getting their own characters to appreciate. Just because I like Kevin Conroy doesn't mean I can't appreciate another Batman. Under the Red Hood is still awesome, and that one doesn't even have Mark Hamill!

I, like most, enjoyed the treatment Cyborg got. I think he's often underutilized, so it's nice to see him get some attention.
From my understanding, Superman is still supposed to be coming into his role, so he hasn't embraced his Beacon of Hope status yet.
I didn't like the treatment Green Lantern got, but he's the most true to form character from the comic... which was written by Geoff Johns.

Aside from the Divine Crowbar, there isn't anything that I don't enjoy/appreciate about this movie. I would love to see DC do all seven remaining volumes of this series.",1496102400,2,958,4.829268292682927
6071991,2,B00GD9GNEY,"The action scenes were great, but to be honest, there was just so much of it that it grew tiresome -- just punch after punch after punch through nonstop waves of enemies. The plot is cookie-cutter good-vs-evil stuff: evil character tries to take over the world, and the heroes put a stop to it in less than an hour. I never really felt like the earth was in trouble. No real character development is attempted, outside of maybe Cyborg's origin story.

We all love the characters, but the movie is just riding on the coattails of how cool the characters already are. If it were about unknown superheroes, there would be no reason to care at all... just being honest.",1495584000,,665,4.541666666666667

6072008,2,B00GD9GNEY,"Well, it's a nice-looking film. There's nothing particularly impressive nor disappointing about the animation design. The story, unfortunately, is not particularly memorable: it's another version of the first-time-that-superheroes-meet-each-other tale, and it's neither the best nor the worst of them.  Several of the characterizations are unfortunate:  for example, Captain Marvel (to whom DC now wishes us to refer as ""Shazam"") is written as, literally, the exact opposite of who he has always been, and there are several instances of gratuitous cursing. The words in question seem to be attempts at humor, but while a well-placed expletive can be hilarious, these aren't.  I honestly don't know to whom this film would appeal: it's too violent and coarse for young children, yet I'd think anyone over the age of 10 would find it pretty vapid.",1484956800,,845,5.386363636363637

6072013,2,B00GD9GNEY,Not that great of a movie in fact I didn't really like it at all.  Misrepresentation of characters such as Billy Batson as some delinquent.  It has a lot of action but that's it.  I also don't know why there is such a need for off color or foul language in these animated features.  Maybe the creators just aren''t intelligent enough to portray powerful characters without foul language.,1479686400,,387,4.647058823529412
6072014,2,B00GD9GNEY,"Ugh. Wonder Woman, one of the most capable of anyone in the DC Universe, is mocked and trivialized the whole time in this movie. Somehow they manage to call her a ""whore"" and a ""bimbo"" in the course of this 72 minutes, which obviously has nothing to do with anything. Guys are hitting on her throughout and it's both  distracting and childish. It added nothing to the movie... just made it seem like a 15-year-old boy wrote it. Darkseid was cool though, and WW definitely took charge in defeating him. More the reason to NOT treat her character in such a demeaning manner.",1476576000,,572,4.553398058252427

No Martian Manhunter? Not like im a huge fan, but im disappointed he is left out of this version of the JL. I kept feeling like Cyborg and the Motherbox was a stand in for J'ohn
Green Lantern is played like Guy Gardner, not at all like Hal Jordan. Sortof one dimensional ?

6072025,4,B00GD9GNEY,"The voice work isn't the best, especially for Diana and Batman. I think even fans who aren't attached to Kevin Conroy and Susan Eisenberg will find those two characters weren't done well. However, the animation and design are great.

The antagonism between the characters is over done, but it's really only an issue with the Green Lantern and Superman. We expect Batman to be a jerk, but Superman is supposed to be a nice guy, and Green Lantern is portrayed as way too full of himself. He even starts a fight with Batman just because he ticked Lantern off. What was just bad is that Lantern started it with the line ""Let's rumba Spooky!"" No, just no. Wonder Woman's opening scene is great. Her second scene? Not so much. You could overlook most of that, though, if there was connection between the characters. Cyborg and Shazam have some good moments, and Green Lantern and Batman showed some promise in the second half, but none of the other JL members really even get to know each other, and that goes for the ""romance"" between Superman and Wonder Woman, too.

On the plus side, Batman is awesome, the fight scenes are good (if a bit gory), and it's a good story line. Not one of DC's best, but far from its worst.",1467072000,,1216,4.5227272727272725

6072054,4,B00GD9GNEY,"DC animated universe takes a crack at telling the Justice League origin story.  Also doubles as the new Cyborg origin.  Based on the New 52 instead of the original universe, DC mostly succeeds in creating another good story.
The good:
Animation is top notch.  The characters all look pretty darn close to the comic counterparts in New 52.
The story is tight, with plenty of action.  Solid plot worthy of forming the JL.

The bad:
DC is always a little weak on explaining things.  The origin of Cyborg makes little sense without more exposition.  Same with Darkseid's reason for invading.
The voice choices are a little off for some of the characters.  It's distracting to hear Shemar Moore's voice on what is supposed to be a teenager.
The ugly:
As a few others have mentioned, Superman's personality leaves a lot to be desired.
The sub plot of Supes and Wonder Woman falling for each other was annoying.

Overall, I liked it.  DC continues to dominate in the animated superhero movie department.",1457827200,,996,4.771929824561403
6072055,4,B00GD9GNEY,"The Justice League for Starters! The Jim Lee & Geoff John's Justice League Origin Graphic novel gets an animated treatment, it's clever and cute, I hope the first full justice league voice-action is better, but I also hope they include big baddie Darkseid like this feature does. Having the Heroes aware of each other's exploits or possible existence in some cases, but never having met is fun but feels a bit rushed even by animated feature standards. The dialogue is clever at times, as are some of the gags like Wonder Woman discovering ice cream, Batman filtching Lantern's ring, Billy Batson's prepubescent intellect shinning through his physical persona. Long time voice director Andrea Romano doesn't use any over her long time talent here from the 90's & 00's but it's not bad even without Kevin Conroy. Sean Astin is Shazam (so he isn't Capt Marvel anymore, really?), Chris Gorham is flash, Justin Kirk is GL, MICHELLE Monaghan is brilliant as WW, Jason o'mara as Batman, Shemar Moore is Cyborg, and Alan Tudyk as Supes. It's got a PG-13 rating for some battle gore and likely some of the less heroic but hilarious banter, insults and exchanges between the fledgling Super Friends.",1457222400,,1190,4.925373134328358

6072065,4,B00GD9GNEY,"This brings together classic Justice League characters.  Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Cyborg, Green Lantern, Flash.

One complaint is that the last hero called himself Shazam, instead of Captain Marvel .  Shazam was the wizard who gave him his powers, and it was also shown that calling the name Shazam was still how he transformed.  So how could he call himself that without transforming?

That aside this is a great Justice League Movie.  Batman and Green Lantern begin an investigation leading to evidence of an alien invasion.  Then Wonder Woman is introduced.  Together she and Superman save the President.  Then all 4 team up.

Next Victor Stone is mortally wounded.  His father tried to save him with experimental technology.  That interacted with the invaders technology, transforming Victor into a Cyborg.  Victor interfaces with an alien computer, and learns their invasion plans.  To transform all humans into mindless and expendable soldiers.

Finally Darkseid himself comes to Earth.  All 7 tag team him.  Blinding him and then banishing him from Earth.

Loved the ending.  All 7 being honored by the President, acknowledged as heroes.  Also loved how Wonder Woman compared the Justice League to ancient Olypians.  That the Justice League is in essence a Pantheon.",1454716800,,1280,5.237623762376238

Okay, first the positives:

 Kevin Konroy's replacement for Batman isn't terrible
 Cyborg, Hal Jordan, and Darkseid are all voiced nicely.
 The art style has a cool anime look to it.
 The movie is very loyal to the novel in terms of the plot

The Negatives:

 The writers can't decide who the hell this movie is for, as characters awkwardly say TV-PG phrases like ""freaking"" and ""butt"", but later say words like ""s***"". Also, there's plenty of violence (which is fine!, but make up your mind about which audience you're targeting).

 Shazaam is in this movie instead of Aquaman, and Shazaam sucks... a lot.

 The voice acting for the vast majority of characters (Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash, etc.) is abysmal. I'd wager the voice actors phoned in a lot of these lines.

 Shazaam is in this movie... (I'm sorry, but I feel it needed to be stated a second time... he seriously ruins the movie).

 Cyborg's origin isn't adequately explained in the film like it is in the comics.

The overall quality just feels cheap. Bruce Timm (the guy who was in charge from Batman the animated series through Justice League: Unlimitied) showed us just how amazing and mature these superhero stories can be. This film made me realize just how badly I took Timm for granted.",1439856000,,1287,4.751131221719457
6072107,1,B00GD9GNEY,"I picked up ""Justice League: War"" for a couple reasons. First reason, I'm a die-hard Justice League fan. Second reason, I grew up with Batman: the Animated Series and Superman: the Animated Series, and have watched with sheer joy as these two initially humble projects spawned a wealth of some of the best animated entertainment out there. That having been said, I went into this thing very optimistic. By all rights, Warner Bros. could easily have scored a five-star review from me. It wouldn't have been that hard! All they had to do was not mess it up too badly.

Unfortunately, they messed it up too badly. Hence my single-star and the scathing text to follow.

I don't believe I've ever been so disappointed by something with the DCAU brand, but I think I can explain it. Partly, the failure of Justice League: War can be explained by the lack of involvement of Bruce Timm. He's not completely flawless, but I'm willing to bet the cash-monies that if he'd been in charge of the effort it wouldn't have sucked so bad. However, I'm not sure this film would've been up his alley, because the source material is the launch arc of The New 52, which sucks all manner of balls very, very hard. (and, while I don't actually have a point of reference from which to guess how Bruce Timm feels about The New 52, his existing body of DCAU work would suggest that he's an old schooler of very discerning taste)

I've not read the source material upon which JL: War is based, but from what I've seen in a few of these reviews, the movie hews fairly close to the original text (with one or two minor exceptions). I mention that by way of saying two things: first, my review here will deal only with the animated movie, and second, if this film's goal was, in some measure, to win me over and make me run out to my local comic book shoppe to start reading what DC's been cranking out lately, it's failed in ways I never thought a DCAU product was capable of failing.

With that out of the way, let's talk about all of the awful threads that were woven together into this annoying little tapestry of dog leavings. First, the characters. Anyone who has any love for any of the flagship superheroes of the DC Universe will be saddened or made very, very angry by their depiction in this film.

Green Lantern is an immature flying man-child who proves decidedly unworthy of the great power he's been given. I mean, yes, throughout the character's history, Hal Jordan is shown to be cocky, almost to the point of arrogance, but his ring chose him because, beneath the brash fighter pilot, there was ultimately a redeeming nobility about him. The quintessential depiction of Hal Jordan in DCAU work is probably the character we see in Green Lantern: The Animated Series. The Green Lantern character we see in JL: War, however, is closer to Guy Gardner than he is to the classic Hal Jordan. That's not a good thing, and since GL is one of the first heroes we meet in JL: War, that means we're off to a *really* shaky start.

Batman is flat and boring. No, sorry, let me rephrase. Batman is not supposed to be flat and boring, but in JL: War, that's how we see him. The prerequisites of being Batman, it seems, are martial arts, a grappling hook and a gravelly voice, because those are the only ways in which this Batman resembles the one I know from other media. The most depth Batman evidences are just after the halfway point in the movie, when he removes his mask and reveals his secret identity to Hal Jordan, while reciting his ""my parents were killed"" backstory, FOR NO APPARENT REASON. The depiction of Batman, in particular, evidences a critical flaw in the writers' methodology: they take for granted that we already know these characters, know why they are who they are and why they do what they do, and so they decide that they won't bother giving the characters' origin stories any sort of treatment. Which is fine: a lot of media inspired by the comic book tales of our favorite heroes manage to pull this off fairly well. However, the problem in JL: War seems to be that the writers view the characters' backstories as a burden, and so not only do they decide they're not going to deal with or depict them in any great detail, but they're going to ignore them in the characterization of the Justice League heroes. Case in point, as a near-zealous footsoldier in his own personal crusade against crime, my take on Batman is that he would NEVER EVER EVER reveal his secret identity to someone he'd only just met -- especially when that someone had proven, over the course of just under an hour of screentime, that he has the emotional maturity level of... well, Guy Gardner. (if you have a good analogy at hand, why reach further?) Batman is a loner on his quest for justice: in virtually all Justice League media, Batman rarely (if ever) becomes anything but a part-time member of the League. He doesn't open up to others; he's insular, selfish, flawed. He believes that, despite his dearth of powers, he is the only man capable standing between the innocent and the wicked. The Batman I know and love wouldn't trust someone like JL: War's Green Lantern enough to remove his mask for him, nor would he be particularly interested in palling around with him for an hour and twenty minutes of god-awful turd on film.

Superman is an idiot. I guess The New 52 must be all about wanton destruction and flashy, gratuitous uses of highly destructive powers, because nobody in JL: War exemplifies these virtues better than the Man of Steel himself. In his first meeting with GL and Batman, they fight for no apparent reason (Gl: ""These strange devices are alien? HEY! Superman's an alien! I'mma go beat on him now! A-duhr duhr duhr!""), and Superman breaks out the heat vision with next to no prompting at all. Classic Superman shows incredible restraint when using his eye-lasers: this is the ability he resorts to against very powerful foes, or when he finds some utilitarian way to employ it (like when he needs to re-weld that dillapidated bridge back together in order to save the schoolbus full of orphaned nuns [and their kittens]!). BUT NOT THIS GUY!!! He is heat-visioning every chance he gets -- basically everything that moves is gettin' heat-visioned around this guy -- and using clearly lethal force in every single fight scene that this movie decides to bludgeon your eyes with. If Batman weren't Batman, he could easily have been killed in his initial confrontation with Superman, and so it actually made me laugh out loud when Batman managed to stop the fight by standing still and explaining to Green Lantern that ""He doesn't kill."" Yeah, sure, he hadn't killed anyone in the movie yet -- but not for want of trying!! JL: War's Superman is a ham-fisted and irredeemably stupid rendering of comics' original superhero. Everyone involved in this re-imagining of an iconic character ought to be deeply ashamed of themselves, especially when the DCAU is FILLED with much better representations of the character. They should know better, and it was well within their ability to DO better.

And now we come to Wonder Woman. DC's flagship heroine, the model for female superheroes everywhere, is given just as shoddy a treatment here as all of her other Justice League peers. In her appearance in JL: War, she is a petulant, ignorant brute of a woman who is just too stupid to get along on her own in ""man's world"" without her handler, Steve Trevor. While it's true that a part of Wonder Woman's story is her leaving amazonian society and learning the ways of the outside world, her handling in her first few scenes in this film feels like it was written by a pre-teen boy avoiding a night of math homework. It should come as no surprise that the writing credits of JL: War are all men: Wonder Woman plays out the way that one might expect from an average group of male comics nerds telling their own stories involving iconic characters. She has no depth to her, her one motivation appears to be breaking and stabbing things (which is so far from the real character's motivation that it's insulting), and the fact that she ends up being an object of affection to be postured-over by the likes of alpha-males like Superman and Green Lantern utterly diminishes any chance she might have at living up to being a role model for independent, heroic women everywhere.

The Flash... actually, the Flash comes off okay in JL: War. He does what he's supposed to do, and he commits none of the cardinal sins that his fellows are guilty of. Either they just plain ran-out of chest-thumping testosterone by the time they got around to writing for the Flash, or they just found him too boring to make him a giant jerk. But, however it went down, the Flash easily comes off as the most likable superhero in the entire movie. Too bad he gets so little screentime.

Let's spend a little time on Captain Marvel. Sorry, guys, but that's the character's name. He pre-dates Marvel Comics by several decades; I really don't care how badly Marvel would like to own all possible uses and iterations of the word ""marvel."" The character's re-naming as ""Shazam"" is fundamentally a dumb move; the first time he meets up with the other heroes, he says to them: ""I'm Shazam!"" Which he shouldn't be able to do, because ""Shazam"" is the magic word he uses to transform, and when he says it he tends to summon a GIANT BOLT OF ZEUS' LIGHTNING. Which, of course, doesn't happen when he introduces himself, so I guess for legal purposes Captain Marvel's magic word is now somehow contextually sensitive. Perhaps your phone's auto-correct could learn a thing or two from Captain Marvel. It's worth pointing out that Billy Batson/Captain Marvel are just as immature and childish as any of the other heroes in this movie. And while it might seem that this makes him fit in all the more (since Billy Batson is a kid when he's not transformed into Captain Marvel), it actually doesn't. The entire reason Billy gets chosen as custodian for the powers of Captain Marvel is because he *is* mature for his age. Past depictions of Captain Marvel have shown him as somewhat nave and childlike, but innocently so. Billy Batson is a decidedly un-heroic sociopath: he sneaks his way into a football game, sneaks into the locker room after the game, and when Vic Stone covers for the kid when the ushers come 'round looking for the little jerk, he up and steals Stone's jersey. Now, maybe it's just me, but if I were an ancient wizard, and I needed to find a mortal in the world who was worthy to receive the wisdom of Solomon, the strength of Hercules, the stamina of Atlas, the power of Zeus, the courage of Achilles and the speed of Mercury, I wouldn't pick a snotty little jerk who sneaks into sporting events and steals things from people who try to do right by him. Also: when Billy *does* turn into Captain Marvel, he doesn't appear to have anything resembling the wisdom of Solomon. In fact, he's dumber than a bag of hair.

And finally, the last hero who shows up in the piece is Vic Stone, aka Cyborg. Cyborg is a whiny man-child who plays football. It's not clear where he plays football: he appears to be at least college-aged, and yet he tells us in one of his first scenes with his father that ""scouts"" were in the stands at his most recent game, who offered him a ""free ride."" Free ride where? Was he playing high school ball? In a giant stadium? A giant stadium with an over-zealous ticket-taker (who is somehow just dumb enough not to notice a shifty little orphan sneaking past him)? The movie chooses never to clear this up, because it dives right into the dramatic conflict between Vic and his father, who is a scientist (not really clear what discipline of science Vic's dad practices; he just kind of does science, and sciencey things). Vic happens upon his dad while he is in the middle of some fairly involved science-ing, and he's mad that his dad didn't go to see any of his football games. (seriously, how old is Vic, what is he being offered a free ride to, and why does the free ride matter if he gets to play football in a giant stadium and is adored by the multitudes, so much so that a larcenous, super-powered orphan is compelled to steal his jersey??) This provokes dad to launch into a rant about how football doesn't matter because some people have super powers, and therefore that makes Vic's apparently only marketable skills worthless. By the way, in the history of comic books, it's never happened that super powers have made pro-sports of any kind redundant. Several characters, in many comics media, still play sports even with super-powered characters running around doing things. So not only is Vic's dad a terrible father, his reason for not going to any of his son's football games (at the high school??) is one of the six stupidest things I've ever heard in my entire life. Which may mean that Vic's dad is also bad at science-ing, because science (from what I'm told) requires a degree of intelligence that does not appear to be present in the ""superheroes make football stupid"" line of argument. Or, maybe this was just an excuse, and the real reason that Vic's dad is a bad parent is because he's just plain too busy making science to go to football games... and is also, at the same time, bad at coming up with excuses for why he doesn't go to football games. The tension between Vic and his father is so poorly executed, you have to wonder why it's in the movie at all. Oh, and then the parademons invade, Vic gets hurt by Darkseid's space magic, and Vic's dad has to make science to keep him from dying. Which turns him into a Cyborg, and gives him super powers. ... Does this mean that his playing football is now okay, since he also has powers? I'm not sure; the two never revisit their argument after all the science happens.

Once all the characters are together, in the same place, they just sort of agree (without ever really agreeing) to team up, I guess? Because, lo and behold, Darkseid shows up! He comes in and shows that he's evil by heat-visioning everything he can see (wait, didn't Superman do that earlier?...). In response to Darkseid's appearance, the heroes (and the writers) display the exact level of wit they collectively possess:
 GL: I'm guessing that's the badguy!?
 Batman: Lucky guess.
Now THAT'S the kind of dialogue that shows me I'm really dealing with the world's greatest detective!... But, really, I was guessing at this point that the writers, deficient as they'd already proven themselves to this point, were saving up their juju for the big reveal of their villain. Darkseid himself shows up, and with his first line, surely I'll be so impressed that I *might* give this review another star on Amazon!
 Darkseid: I am entropy. I am death. (ridiculously long pause) I am.... (another brief pause) Darkseid.

So, still one star. Shame on you, JL: War! First of all, Darkseid represents neither entropy nor death. His character is all about control and domination, not senseless slaughtet and destruction. But any intelligence, nuance or depth of Darkseid's character was just too cumbersome to include in this narrative: from the point that Darkseid appears, until the end of the movie, what you basically have is an extended episode of Dragonball Z featuring people who bear a passing resemblance to beloved comics characters. (Captain Marvel even gathers and throws a spirit bomb [of lightning] at one point!) The heroes' various plans to thwart Darkseid (""Stab him in the eyes!"" ""Hey, Cyborg, talk to Darkseid's technology and make it so that the portals suck all the parademons back up -- but ONLY the parademons and nothing else!"") are so lazy and sophomoric that they make you feel like the movie must think you're not smart enough to be bothered by them. But it's not like the fight against Darkseid ultimately matters: I was so put-off by the initial encounters I had with all of these heroes that I really didn't care about them throughout the unfolding story; not once was I left on the edge of my seat, hoping that this hero or that was going to come through it all okay. Why would I? Even if I cared, I was never left with the sense that any of these heroes were ever in any real danger at all. None of the things Darkseid demonstrated he could do ever really inspired much terror in me, because they held such a close resemblance to all the stupid nonsense I'd seen the other heroes do for the entirey of the film. I wasn't compelled, at any point, to cheer for the characters: I could sit here and be totally secure in knowing that, after taking some licks for some amount of minutes, the heroes would eventually prevail by getting back up, catching a second wind, and out-brutalizing Darkseid to the point where he's beaten so badly that he screams ""NOOOOOOOOO!"" and then explodes in a blinding flash of light. Which is actually not that far off from what actually happens.

Do not watch this film. Not even to see how bad it is; there are MANY DCAU films which are much better. You should only pick up ""Justice League: War"" if you have a table that needs rebalancing, or you are fashioning homemade coasters out of used CDs and DVDs.",1439856000,4,17181,4.622338683262365

6072115,3,B00GD9GNEY,"Ok watch, good rental video. Really they didn't do too great with the Characters. Particularly Wonder Woman, but also Batman and Superman were totally off. Superman seemed way too arrogant and almost like some high school football jock, Batman was kind of better but he was just too willing to share and give his secret identity away (and just a wee bit too friendly as well). Wonder Woman, eh she was just some wild Amazonian who wanted to fight (oh yah and OF COURSE she just instantly gets all flirty with Superman, that was sort of annoying and clich honestly). Some of the banter provides entertainment (especially between Batman and Lantern).  Darkseid's incarnations was pretty cool but obviously they had to tone him down big time (a crowbar in his eye? Really?) so that was kind of lame to see, for example there were parts where I was watching and saying ""No Flash/Batman you just took a punch from Darkseid sorry but something's broken"". I really liked this version of Cyborg, really got sort of gritty (I say gritty but it's not too bad) with his injury and transformation into the character so that was nice. The action in this movie is constant which is another great thing. Overall I'd say this movie is Ok but it's not the best nor does it stand out in any way. 3/5 for me.",1437523200,2,1289,4.58008658008658
6072116,4,B00GD9GNEY,"The first of what was DC Comics' New 52 lineup of their DC Universe made-for-video animated flicks, Justice League: War is based on the first few issues of the current Justice League comic book series taking place after the reboot movie, Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox where Flash ended up restarting the entire timeline. Jay Olivia continues from Flashpoint as director of this new line-up, plus an entirely new voice cast at the JLA.

Mysterious kidnappings have been happening all over America, particularly in Gotham, where Green Lantern Hal Jordan tracks down a certain cape-wearing menace. It turns out to be an alien monster called a Parademon, so Lantern and Batman team up to stop him, although it commits suicide to cover its tracks. Batman figures out its alien origins, so he and Lantern fly to Metropolis to confer with its resident alien, Superman. The Man of Steel doesn't take their interrogation well at first, which ends in the usual ""superhero vs. superhero"" resolution. Meanwhile, more Parademons start springing up all over, with Wonder Woman saving the President from an attack on Air Force One, and the Flash arriving at S.T.A.R. Labs to witness the origin of Cyborg, a high school football player whose body was mangled after a Parademon portal exploded in his face. Cyborg is surprised to discover the hero Shazam knows him, and it turns out that this version of Captain Marvel is really a young boy. The Parademons are being lead by the tyrannical god, Darkseid, who in this timeline is at least about a yard taller than before. His forces capture Superman and take him back to be converted into one of their soldiers, with Batman going to rescue him. The remaining heroes assemble and proceed to take out each of Darkseid's eyes which shoot menacing Omega Beams. After Batman brings back Superman, Cyborg hacks into one of Darkseid's computers to reroute all his forces back home, along with the now eyeless Darkseid. The heroes from this point pledge to the U.S. government to work together as a team to defend the world from other various threats, one of which appears in a post-credits scene with Ocean Master vowing vengeance against the surface world for the death of his father.

JL: War has up until this point one of the first real times we see the League getting together for the first time, not like in New Frontier which was more an assembling of Earth's forces against a similar threat. The versions of some of the characters like Batman and Flash are spot-on, but these versions of Shazam, Wonder Woman, and Green Lantern has them being colossally too arrogant and conceded. The new voice cast is okay, but they were smart to recast Nathan Fillion as Green Lantern in the sequal, Justice League: Thrown Of Atlantis. It's also plain to see that DC wanted to capitalize on the success of the original Avengers movie showing several heroes uniting to confront an alien menace, but the addition of Darkseid as the big bad made it a lot more epic in scale. For reals check this out if you want to see what the Dawn Of Justice movie is leading up to.",1437264000,,3092,4.777570093457944

6072118,5,B00GD9GNEY,"Earth invasion courtesy of darkseid never gets old for me.  This was super fun (hyukhyuk.)  Reimagining of the supers meeting and cyborg origin story.  Bats is hilarious as straight man and still the leader with his super brains.  This time Lantern is the loudmouth goofball instead of Flash, who ends up being one of the most normal and gets laughs off of that.  Supes is a little more dark, angry, and less of a scientist thinker here.  He and Ws seem to have the beginnings of something.  Speaking of which she still plays the straight ingenue with fists of steel and courage to match.  Shazam is always weird for me, I never get the appeal.  He is modernized here as a slick street punk rather than the goody two shoes.  Great rendition.",1437177600,,741,4.545454545454546
6072119,3,B00GD9GNEY,"To be honest, I have no idea why I liked this movie so much. Maybe it brought back memories from when I was much younger. I loved the old Superman/Batman cartoons, plus others like Johnny Quest, The Herculoids, Spaceghost. The last two mentioned cartoons I would love to see in new movies. The action was excellent, dialog was almost as good, the comedy was the only thing that needed work. I remember the flash being more slap stick. They forced Shazam into the comedy role and he couldn't pull it off. Darkside was an excellent bad guy but, he needed some more caractor development. The movie seemed rushed at times as well, blame that on the writing team. Anyway it was a good movie, a couple hours well spent watching it.",1437091200,,725,4.541984732824427

6072121,4,B00GD9GNEY,"I just watched Justice League War. It was pretty good. Different from the comic it was adapted from, but still good. The animation was excellent, the writing for the most part pretty good. The language was a little salty, with plenty of ""s***"" and ""damn"" thrown in. These were modern superheroes, and they showed little hesitation when it came time to taking lives (like when Superman kills Desaad).

I'm not sure how I felt about the inclusion of Shazam (as he's called now), or this version of him. He did seem reasonably differentiated from Superman, at least.

The repartee between Green Lantern and just about anyone was very enjoyable. Wonder Woman came off as a bit stilted.",1436832000,,681,4.811965811965812

It is a rehash of Superman/Batman: Apocalypse, in that once again Darkseid is the villain, and he and Superman go toe to toe. The writing is terrible, and the animation is poor. It is basically a feature length brawl and that is it. Don't buy it. In fact I would recommend you don't even rent it, unless you like the New 52, or are a DCU completionist.

6072158,5,B00GD9GNEY,"First let me start off by saying THESE ARE NOT THE NORMAL SUPER HEROES THAT YOU WILL EXPECT! This version of the justice league team is very different than what most are used to. Very different. If you like the personalities they way they've always been and don't like seeing change, don't get this movie.

Personally, I found this movie to be funny, witty, action packed, and different. It was quite refreshing for me. I loved the cartoon network's justice league. Loved the traditional characteristics of our favorite superheroes, but this one was quite interesting. I'm going to go into the personality of all the heroes present and why I thought it was plausible and let you see for yourself if you will like these changes or not.

Green Lantern- yes this is the Hal Jordan version. Personally I never liked this version of green lantern and have always preferred John Stewart. His personality is like the Flash in the Justice League cartoon. Cocky, a bit childish and immature, and the other super heroes kind of make fun of him. Especially batman.

Batman- this batman is a bit more chatty, but it's usually with a witty remark that makes me laugh. He is smart, and is mostly a legend until the plot of the movie begins. He is also a bit more cooperative than usual. While normally, this would subtract from batman's normal demeanor, I found his sarcastic behavior just funny and likeable. He is still very smart, and every bit of a detective as he always is.

Wonder woman- this wonder woman is completely an amazon. She carries a sword and uses it. I never understood why a woman (even if an amazon) would mostly use her fists. This movie shows her skill with it as well as her skill with her lasso and not for truth telling. She comes off still young, fascinated by simple things like ice cream and is a bit impatient as an amazon princess should be as she doesn't see the importance of waiting to meet the president when she has stuff to do herself. She is also very war oriented which makes sense since she comes from a war like society.

Superman- this is probably the biggest change. Superman is a bit self-centered, territorial, rash, and eager to fight. It is an entirely new superman and reminds me of superboy from Young Justice. As I like superboy from Young Justice, I didn't mind the change so much and enjoyed the new take on him. As this is the complete opposite of the traditional superman, this is most likely what most hard core fans will dislike about the movie.

Captain Marvel/Shazam- also not your typical fight for the sake of good just because superhero. This version of Shazam truly acts like a kid. He is not a saint, gets into trouble, and has trouble focusing on important things as most young teens (around 13/14) would.  He does have a good heart and helps out, but they definitely remind you he is still a kid and sometimes forgets about what's really important.

Flash- I'm not used to flash not being the butt of everyone's joke. This flash is quite mature and has a leveled head.

Cyborg- This movie could be considered a cyborg orgin story as well. Previously I only heard his background from teen titans. Most of the movie is him struggling to come to terms with being half robot.

As I said previously, I found the movie quite refreshing, witty, and enjoyable. The plot is the typical aliens are trying to invade the world and the superheroes have to join together to stop it. Very overdone plot line, but with the changed personalities of the characters I didn't really mind. This is definitely a PG-13 movie. Aliens get sliced and diced and you even see the heroes jabbing sharp objects into the villains eyes. If you don't want your kid watching that much violence, be warned.

If you don't mind the movie breaking from tradition, you will probably enjoy it.",1428969600,2,3805,4.605612998522895
6072159,4,B00GD9GNEY,"Pretty good but really,They should have kept the ""funny"" parts to a minimum. And (sob) why couldn't Kevin Conroy keep his amazing role as Batman?!But any-one who wants to know the origin of the JLA should buy it.",1428969600,,212,4.605263157894737

Not to mention, Green Lantern is portrayed as a hot headed, arrogant schmuck, Wonder Woman as a combat crazy female and Cyborg as a whining young adult craving attention from his emotionally detached Dad.  Not a suitable cartoon for cartoon kids!!!  Green Lantern curses a few times too many and the plot is SUPER thin to top it ALL off!!!  Darkseid is 1 of the most fearsome characters in ALL of COMICDOM and they don't give a single morsel of anything on his back story or what he's about.  You just know he's a bad guy.
A poorly done script/story and a weak cast too.  I don't even like the voice actors that were chosen for the characters.  Disappointed all around!!",1425772800,,1050,4.5132275132275135

6072195,4,B00GD9GNEY,"To be brutally blunt: Justice League: War is probably not a movie you'll enjoy if you aren't already familiar with most of the cast, with the exception of Cyborg, who gets his origin story in this particular story anyway. While the New 52 comic continuity is a reboot, Justice League itself leaves the development of individual heroes to their individual comics for the most part, leaving the Darkseid story arc at the beginning of the Justice League *series* to focus on its own rather basic inter-dimensional invasion plot while featuring a lot of bombastic action sequences and witty banter. Infofar as loyalty to the comic story it's adapting, the major change this movie makes to the Darkseid arc is leaving Aquaman out of the equation entirely (Aquaman makes his debut here in the comic), and inserting Shazam (who wasn't involved in Justice League's opening New 52 arc at all).

While lacking in familiar voices for the cast that would present a familiar feel for those who enjoyed DC's previous animated offerings, the animation is a notch shy of top-notch and the performances are quite good. Other DC movies have had better action than this one, and more fleshed-out plots, though. Puzzlingly, though the first in line as far as animated ""New 52"" movies go, this one doesn't really try to establish itself as a starting point in the new continuity. It feels like a movie that should have happened after Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, Flash, and Shazam all had their own individual animated movies.

Nevertheless, the flaws didn't ruin the experience for me; if you're already a DC fan it'll probably be a blast to watch. Can't recommend it to newcomers, though. Dip into some other DC media first.",1425254400,,1723,4.917525773195877

6072241,4,B00GD9GNEY,"I think that my opinion is somewhere between the party line and the outsider, when it comes to what other fans seem to think.  Here it goes: I flat out liked it, as a whole.  As someone who has just recently (within the last three years or so) gotten into the DC Universe, including the various animated series and the comics [mostly new 52 stuff], I can't say I'm a die-hard fan.  But I have always loved superheroes and the different journeys that they can take us mere mortals on.  I have been recently watching the JL and JLU animated series - marathoning them to be more truthful.  And while I appreciate other fans' take on Kevin Conroy (Batman), Susan Eisenberg (Wonder Woman) and Tim Daly/George Newbern (Superman) being the definitive voice cast, I feel like the new voices are a nice change for a new direction in the storytelling.

Jason O'Mara as Batman - I love the serious, gritty voice acting on his part and the slight humorous edge they seem to be trying to convey with the animation in this one (though his face does seem almost overly surprised at times).  I always thought Batman had a wry sense of humor about things.  To me, O'Mara fits in with the new casting and is a worthy successor to Conroy.

Alan Tudyk as Superman & Michelle Monaghan as Wonder Woman - I'm grouping these two together, because it seemed like that's kind of what this movie did too.  I loved the flirtations between the two of them and how obviously fish-out-of-water they were on Earth compared to the rest of the JL.  That said, as other reviewers have pointed out, this film didn't quite succeed in making them three-dimensional characters.  And Wonder Woman was overly Thor-ed in terms of characterization.  Yes, puny mortals and all that.  We get it.  The whole thing with the ice cream truck made me chuckle, but it also made me shake my head in bemusement.  THAT'S what you choose to do with one of the ONLY spotlight scenes for WW in the entire film, DC?  Okay then...I found myself hoping that in ""Throne of Atlantis"" we get to see more humanizing aspects of our goddess and alien JL members.  The voice acting itself, while solid, was nothing overly special or memorable.

Justin Kirk as Green Lantern - Wow, they came on kind of strong with the whole 'Hal is an arrogant prick' thing in this one.  I liked the voice acting and the smarmy personality, to a degree.  But as someone mostly unfamiliar with Hal (more familiar with Jon Stewart, actually), it got kind of off-putting.  I did like the push-pull dynamic between him and Batman.  Also, the interactions with Flash allowed me to see a glimmer of their friendship, which is something I really liked in JL: Flashpoint Paradox.  Kind of interested to see what Nathan Fillion, who I really like as an actor, does with the role in TOA.

Christopher Gorham as The Flash - Got probably the least amount of screen time out of all of them, but was likeable enough.  Curious to see if he'll get his own solo film, due to the popularity of the new CW show or if they'll keep riding the Batman/Superman train till it derails.

Shemar Moore as Cyborg - Completely unfamiliar with him before this movie.  I knew he was part of the new Justice League and is (supposedly) going to have his own, live action film.  I can honestly say that this character was the most likeable in the film.  The connections to Billy Batson and even the Flash, through his scientist Father, before he got his powers made me curious.  The scenes between him and Doctor Stone, that first fight scene with Darkseid's minions and the overall advantages to which they utilized Vic was really well conceived.  In what is supposed to be the Justice League's origin, it's also a showcase of Vic Stone's metamorphosis from every-man to superheroe and how alone that makes him feel.  The JL gives him a place to belong and a purpose for his life, after his football dream is obviously over.  Obviously cliched in terms of story, but done with so much heart that I couldn't NOT like it!  Plus, the whole interaction with Billy, which leads me to...

Sean Astin as Shazam & Zach Callison as Billy Batson - The New 52 origins for Shazam are a lot more relatable that his original, perfect and priggish personality.  In this he's a street-wise, tough orphan who has been wrung out through the foster-care system and back.  He is still untrusting and a little thief, even now that he's in a home where he can semi-relax.  The only thing I wish is that we could have seen Billy get his powers, instead of him already having them.  Also, do the other kids in his foster home know about the powers?  In the comics they are in on the whole thing.  But I get that due to time constraints they couldn't tell two origin stories in depth (and I'm glad they chose Vic, to be honest).  To Billy, Vic Stone was a hero when he was just a football player.  When he becomes Cyborg, he has this immature, overly musclebound magical guy named 'Shazam' chanting ""Vic-tory!"" in his ear and cheering him on.  I don't think it really sets in for Cyborg that anyone can be a superhero until he finds out Shazam's identity.  There are a couple great moments between the two of them near the end of the film.  I also laughed when Wonder Woman commented on his acting immature and Billy's suggestion for a JL name and the others' reactions.  It was a good choice to have different voice actors for the adult hero and the child alter-ego and both did a really great job, in my opinion.  I just hope Billy isn't shoved aside for Arthur in the next film.  I'd like to see him continue to be part of the League as well.

Darkseid - I was surprised they pulled out the big gun for something that was mainly an ""origin"" of the League.  Also, the conflict just seemed a little overblown for how quickly it got resolved.  I would have liked to see a different villain, on a grander scale.  But the New 52 is what it is, and generally that's enough for me.  Just didn't translate super great in terms of visuals in my opinion.

Overall, the animation in this was better for me than it was in the popular animated ""Justice League: Flashpoint Paradox.""  I am especially glad to see that they've redesigned Aquaman for the next film.  My brother, whom I watched both movies with, commented that Aquaman looked like he had a block for a head in JL:FP - and I agreed.  Some people didn't like the design for Diana in this one, but I like that even while being an ass-kicker she still looked feminine (I can't stand the New 52 comic designs for WW and thankfully this didn't adhere to them).  Probably the actual animation I liked the least, was the design for Batman.  Like I said earlier in the review, I felt like the default face for him was a perpetual ""O"" mouth in surprise and he just seemed kind of underdeveloped in terms of detail.  The visual representation on him wasn't so great for me.  Not my favorite film, but I can honestly say I highly enjoyed it and I like the direction they are taking things in with this New 52 business and the new voice cast.  Now, if only the Throne of Atlantis is as good as the trailer makes it look...",1419897600,,7119,4.469767441860465

6072244,4,B00GD9GNEY,"I liked this. Grittier than most DC animated movies. I must admit, though, some of the other reviews I read were right about the Superman portrayal and, I have to add Green Lantern to that category of a little too arrogant and unlikable.
I am a Green Lantern fan, but, I always thought the Lantern was supposed to be someone who was more on the serious side, not the cocky, non-strategic thinker like this one was. Hal Jordan has always been confident, somewhat cocky but, more serious when the time came for the butt-kicking. This one was quite amateurish and got his buttocks kicked a little too easily.
Superman came off too cocky, too. I would expect, in the ""real world"" for these superheroes to be quite self-absorbed but, this was a big change in the Superman persona for me.
Batman was the only one who seemed to appreciate the seriousness of the situation they were in ahead of time. While I would expect him to be serious, the others were a surprise, to the negative. I wanted to see Batman do to Superman like he did in ""Doom"" or ""Dark Knight Returns"".
I did like what Wonder Woman was: funny, but darned serious.
Flash was as Flash usually is: some serious but, comic relief.
I did like the treatment of Cyborg. He, historically, is an afterthought. He played a serious and significant role here. Good.
It has been a long time since I collected comics and, I suppose there have been many new personalities instilled in the characters.
Maybe I'm just a dinosaur.
Overall, the storyline was well done. Darkseid is a big, bad guy. I do, sort of, think he went down too easily, though.
I would recommend seeing this. Not quite as good as Doom, but, worth seeing. I would give it 3 1/2 stars if I could've.",1419811200,7,1713,4.511254019292605

THE GOOD: Gorgeous WB Animation, great voice actors, and excellent action sequences, as is the staple of DC's direct to video movies.

THE BAD: A thin story that just sort of plods along. Storywise, there's nothing much about this movie that sets it apart from other Justice Leage origin movies or alien invasion premises. Even Darksied, who generally has a lot of presence in most DC stories, feels wooden and shoehorned into this one. I'd say the movie has no personality, but that's inaccurate because of . . .

THE UGLY: What a bunch of jerks! With the exception of--I guess--the Flash, every member of the Justice League is portrayed as arrogant, childish, outright stupid, vapid, ego-maniacal . . . . I guess, I just don't get how these guys are supposed to be heroes or even okay people I might want to be friends with. They really lay it on thick. The characters don't seem to like each other, so why should we like them? By the end of this flick, I sort of wanted Darksied to win so the world doesn't have to suffer this Justice League of Jerkwads protecting them.

6072251,3,B00GD9GNEY,"It's a strange one.  It's as violent as some of the other Justice League movies, but it's also very juvenile in a lot of aspects.

The little girl's voice sounded like a grown woman talking like a child.  The voice acting is so bad, it was actually distracting.  The characterization annoyed me too.  I like mature Wonder Woman, as portrayed in the Justice League television cartoon, or any of the other DTV Justice League movies.  This Wonder Woman's maturity is all over the place.

Notice, I didn't give it one star.  There are still some things left to enjoy here.  Batman's awesome as always, and Green Lantern is fun to watch but overall, the movie needed more polish before being released.

Despite his power, he rarely in the books engages in a face to face confrontation, preferring to let his henchmen do the work, therefore portraying him as a mindless brute with Hulk-like dialogue, ""I am Darkseid"" and ""Arrrggh!"" was an insult to this character, without even mentioning that he was blinded by a crowbar.

6072277,2,B00GD9GNEY,"Justice League: War is a good movie if you're already an established fan of DC and aren't looking to think too much about plot or worry about creativity. The movie starts well enough, demonstrating the issues the heroes have at integrating into society, and using the classic ""Batman a monster?"" story to get the ball rolling. It's an interesting look at how the Justice League could have come about, that's for certain, and a fair adaptation of the comics. However, whatever merits this movie has are weighed down by its flaws. The heroes seem out of character at times to the point of becoming parodies of themselves, what logic is used seems to be present for the sole purpose of getting the heroes from one nameless alien monster fight to the next, and the plot comes off as flimsy if you haven't read the comics. People not already fans of DC will likely find its lack of explanations frustrating, having difficulty knowing who half the villains and cameos are, while longstanding fans will likely find the portrayal of the heroes more of a betrayal. To be perfectly honest, it feels like a much shorter and poorly done Avengers movie, and coming from a long time DC fan, that is a painful thing to have to say.",1415664000,,1216,4.6342592592592595

6072280,3,B00GD9GNEY,"Great action, largely strong (with some caveats) animation, and a brisk pace (with a ponderous, eye-rolling exception) managed to keep my admittedly-quirky attention, and would probably ""wow"" almost any boy under 13. Yet some glaring, and on occasion appalling, incidents of character assassination render Justice League: War another example of the ""dumbed-down"" media content trend infecting so much of the field.

Briefly, the Superman, Green Lantern, Darkseid, and Wonder Woman portrayed here look (more or less) like their forebears. But just like your momma taught you, looks aren't everything. This Superman, for instance, is an arrogant, excessively brutal narcissist, Lantern a detached, self-aggrandizing neocon, while Darkseid could have been almost any uber-powerful cardboard bad guy, and Wonder Woman...well, this is NOT Wonder Woman. Linda Carter should be spinning in her retirement tweeds...and probably is if she has seen this appalling portrayal the Amazon princess.

Using her Superman-level strength and radical peace-through-justice, violence-as-a-last-resort ideology to make the world a better place? Gone. Utterly self-completing, confident, and independent role model for girls (and heck yeah, boys too!)? Totally MIA.

This is a Wonder Woman written solely, one is forced to conclude, to appeal to the most primitive impulses of clueless, heterosexual, adolescent males, and whatever such boys grow up to be if they never learn any better. She is an ultra-violent, eager-to-kill sword slinger and, perhaps even worse, a fawning pin-up groupie. I mean...swooning over Superman? ""Ooooh...I've never met ANYONE like YOU before!"" PLEASE! Wonder Woman is not in this movie. Yes, this Superman is an over-and-oddly muscled, brain-dead thug. Yes, this Green Lantern is a self-obsessed, empathy-challenged Facebook-addicted milk baby. And yes, this Darkseid, cool voice aside, is an overgrown, bland any-villian, almost totally divorced from why the character has heretofore been at the top of the DC villian hierarchy.

But this ""Wonder Woman"", it is not going too far to say, is a disgrace to the name. What the heck could they possibly have been thinking?

6072281,3,B00GD9GNEY,Honestly the movie felt a bit weak in some parts. The way they try to change up the attitudes you'd expect the characters in the movie to have in comparison to every other piece of work they're featured in sort of feels like a forced method to seem original.

It it really atrocious. Compared to the fairly excellent Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox (which I highly recommend), 'War' is just dismal.

6072306,2,B00GD9GNEY,"I love the DC animated movies.  They tend to be far better than their live-action counterparts, excepting the Christopher Nolan Batman movies.
This, however, was not great.  Every single one of the characters felt a little off, and some of them WAY off.
Examples:
Wonder Woman was played as a woman who had no concept of the outside world, and no desire to fulfill her destiny as an envoy of peace from Themyscera.  She was ignorant of any and all customs outside of her Amazon culture.  Sometimes, she almost seemed like an anime character, for instance, when she tasted ice cream for the first time and spread her arms wide to shout to the world that it was the best food ever created.  Even the ""camera"" angle in that scene was something you'd see in an anime.
Superman was a brash, unthinking hothead.  A lot like his New 52 persona in the comics, but taken to the extreme.  I realize they always want to have the obligatory hero-vs-hero throwdown until they realize they're all on the same side, but in this case, the only justification for it was Superman's ""heat vision first, ask questions later"" attitude.  He was a cocky jerk.  Oh, and he killed a LOT of parademons... even after it was revealed that they were inhabitants of worlds conquered by Darkseid and mutated into their parademon forms.  The Superman I love would have tried to find a way to save them, not kill them.
Vic Stone, pre-Cyborging, was an idiot, and his father was an egotistical jerk.
Green Lantern was a cocky but supposedly charming guy, but he really just came off as foolish and untrained. Which is sad, because Hal Jordan in my opinion always has the potential to be the bedrock of a team like the Justice League.

The premise of the story was mediocre, and the resolution was weak.  The fight scenes were intended to be epic, but largely fell flat.
All in all, probably the weakest outing from DC's animated team ever.",1412726400,,1905,4.603550295857988

6072326,2,B00GD9GNEY,"When it was announced that the first volume of Geoff Johns' New 52 Justice League was going to be adapted into one of DC's animated movies, I was pretty pumped for it. A lot of people give the New 52 a lot of crap, not all of it undeserved, but I really enjoyed and continue to enjoy Johns' run on Justice League, which made it all the more disappointing when this film turned out to be like it did.
First and foremost I'll say that it's very well animated and most of the voices were well cast, I'm not totally on board with Jason O'Mara as Batman, but everyone else was all well and good. The plot pretty much followed that of the book from which it's based, though this time they added in Shazam! for some reason and I thought it a faithful adaptation of the material....to a point. When it comes to the characterization of Billy Batson, Superman and Wonder Woman, I could only either roll my eyes or blow air out my nose in annoyance. Batson is just a snotty little jerk, not at all becoming of a kid who'd be entrusted with the powers he has, Superman is a cocky super-jerk and Wonder Woman has the worst of it. The first time the Warrior Princess lays her eyes on the Man of Steel, you can practically see her loins get all frothy, it's ridiculous. Plus, she's not shown to be the smart and strategic warrior she is, just a woman who knows how to swing a sword and yell loudly. It's quite a step down from the Wonder Woman in her own animated movie back in 2009 and I just felt embarrassed.",1410307200,,1496,4.234265734265734

In a way its like the revamped version of a New 52 Justice League. Wonder Womans attire displays that change, but she still looks hot. Shes more tough and carries a sword. Finally when Batman agrees to fight along side of them all, they face Darksied who comes to Earth to naturally destroy the planet. Hes much tougher and bigger than shown in DCs other animated movie called Superman/Batman: Apocalypse. And I mean they all really take a beating!

6072349,5,B00GD9GNEY,"This is an excellent animated adaptation of The New 52 Justice League's origin story.  Bruce Timm was always a hit or miss for me and while he's coming up with a new Justice League movie for release in 2015, he was not the right person to animate The New 52's rebooted Justice League because these characters are all hotheaded novices, a bit crass and still very young superheroes in the making.  Timm's more kiddie-friendly JUSTICE LEAGUE would have cast an unwanted shadow and brought unnecessary baggage to this new origin story.  (I was not a fan of Timm's origin episodes for his JUSTICE LEAGUE because of his ghastly treatment of the female member of DC's Holy Trinity: Diana was depicted as a thief who did not rightly earn the title of Wonder Woman.  That was simply disrespectful to the most famous super heroine in all of comicdom and popular culture.)

In addition to the film's retention of key scenes and dialog almost verbatim from the comics, I especially enjoyed the film's preservation of the Superman and Wonder Woman romantic relationship that began in JUSTICE LEAGUE #12 and continued in their current monthly series SUPERMAN/WONDER WOMAN because those two books are the best things that came out of DC Entertainment's relaunch of its titles under The New 52.

This is not an appropriate movie for young children because of the gory violence and high body count.  There's also some PG-13 language in this flick, which I actually had to rewind the first time I saw the film to make sure I actually heard what I thought I'd initially heard Cyborg say in the final sequences. Otherwise, it's a fun watch and a good time.  If the sequel will be as good as JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR, then JUSTICE LEAGUE: THRONE OF ATLANTIS will undoubtedly be another hit for the DC Animated Universe.",1407196800,,1794,4.764516129032258

6072362,2,B00GD9GNEY,"At one point during Justice League: War, Green Lantern turns to Batman and calls him a phenomenal douchebag.  Welcome to DC Comics New 52 Universe where Green Lantern is an arrogant A-hole, Shazam is an obnoxious teenager, Superman leers at Wonder Woman like hes on the prowl in a singles bar and people on the street are protesting Wonder Woman because she dresses like a whore.  The 18th DC original animated film brings the universally reviled (by anyone who actually likes comics) New 52 to life in an adaptation of Justice League: Origin by Geoff Johns and Jim Lee.  The film retells the first teaming of the Justice League which, by my count, is at least the third time the first teaming has been seen in an animated film.  But I suppose when you re-boot your universe every fortnight you're bound to have some repetition.

Batman and Green Lantern have their first encounter while tracking down a mysterious creature running through Gotham City.  Now admittedly I was never a huge Green Lantern fan but I read the title here and there over 40 years and never recall Hal Jordan being so completely unlikable to the point that you actually find yourself rooting for the villain. The creature turns out to be one of Darkseids Parademons.  It is one of several that have infiltrated the world, planting Mother Boxes as a prelude to an invasion from Apokolips.

But lets not jump too far aheadbefore that we get Superman battling Green Lantern and Batman when he thinks they are working with the Parademons and nearly kills Batman because, you know, kill first and ask questions later is apparently what this new Superman is about.  Eventually they realize they are all on the same page.  The Mother Boxes open portals to Apokolips through which Darkseid and thousands of Parademons emerge to attack the Earth.  Those three heroes along with Cyborg, Shazam, the Flash, and Wonder Woman all join forces to battle the invaders.  Of course in true heroic fashion they fail at first because they all want to grab the glory.  And it is only when they work as a true team that they manage to defeat Darkseid and send him back home.

Frankly Justice League: Origin isn't a strong enough story to have warranted an animated adaptation.  The new 52 was designed to bash longtime DC fans into submission and make them forget everything theyve learned in the previous 70 years or so.  Darkseid was tossed in casually to give them a significant foe to steel themselves against.  And since when is Darkseid like 30 feet tall anyway?  Batman is at least treated with some respect and still seems like Batman.  The Flash gets the short end of the stick and barely has anything to do while Cyborg hogs a good portion of the story as we get his entire origin told.  Why waste roughly one-third of the running time just to tell one characters origin at all?  Heath Corsons screen play is sloppy to say the least and you have to wonder if this guy ever even read a Justice League comic previously.

Director Jay Oliva does an admirable job with the screenplay, particularly the action and fight sequences.  Fortunately for fans the film is largely fight scenes from beginning to end which helps forget about some of the unlikable characters.  This is definitely a PG-13 or even close to an R rated Justice League.  These guys are NOT playing around!

One high point of most DC animated films is a strong voice cast with generally well-respected actors lending their voices to the production.  Even that comes up short in Justice League: War where the cast is led by Sean Astin as Shazam and Michelle Monaghan as Wonder Woman.  In all honesty those two are ok as is Jason O Mara as Batman.  But Justin Kirks squeaky voice as Green Lantern almost had me muting the sound and going with subtitles.

The animation is similar to what weve seen in other recent films such as Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox and Superman: Unbound where the characters appearances are lean and angular with an Anime influence.

Justice League: War is a disappointing entry in the DCU animated film series which has been trending downwards ever since the excellent two-part The Dark Knight Returns adaptation.",1405382400,2,4173,4.738227146814404

Overall, I cannot recommend this animated feature.  DC has proven to be capable of so much better.  They had a great base to build off of, but in this case, chose not to.  Had they created the film to follow the original (Geoff Johns) storyline, it would have been a far better film.",1405382400,,652,4.568965517241379

6072381,2,B00GD9GNEY,"Justice League Unlimited ended in 2006, DC has been putting out these direct to video movies since 2007, and DC made a reboot of their universe in 2012. Here we are at the first adaptation of one of the ""New 52"" comics - Justice League: War, based off of the first Justice League storyline&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Justice-League-Vol-1-Origin-The-New-52/dp/1401237886/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Justice League, Vol. 1: Origin (The New 52)</a>.

Full disclosure, I didn't read the original comic, but I generally like the team behind it. Geoff Johns is a good writer most of the time, and Jim Lee is a superstar artists. I wasn't reading DC comics, because every jumping on point is a jumping off point, and I had left DC behind when they started their reboot. But, let's evaluate what kind of gains they make then they're not bogged down by decades of character development.

Green Lantern is chasing a mysterious figure through Gotham, before crashing into Batman and they team up to discover the purpose of the creature they were chasing. This lead them to team up with Superman, and later the Flash, Wonder Woman, Shazam, and Cyborg, to fight off an invasion by Darkseid.

Like a lot of people I wonder why they chose Darkseid as their first antagonists, because it leaves little places to go for escalation. The answer is that Darkseid is a very boring enemy. Other interpretations of Darkseid have painted him as a smug despot that took pleasure in stealing freedom and joy from the universe. This new Darkseid feels nothing. He's a stone faced totem, going from planet to planet to consume it a la Galactus.

The heroes are a mixed bag. Without judging each individual voice actor, all I can say is you'll want to be forgiving. Character wise... I was not impressed. Batman is always right, because people expect Batman to always be right. Superman although portrayed as very powerful, can be very blunt and unlikable (though they tell me he was worse in the comic). Green Lantern - Hal Jordan is a total ""Bro,"" - a cocky jock that frequently embarrasses himself (hard to believe Geoff Johns would write him like that. The Flash has little screen time, but he come out fine. This is also Cyborg's Origin story, and he's okay.

I hate Wonder Woman in this. She's supposed to be an ambassador, but she has no people skills. It's an annoying trend I've noticed that DC likes to put a leash on their female characters. She might be super strong, but she need handlers to keep her from embarrassing herself. Wonder Woman, Miss Martian, and Starfire all sit in the ""funny foreign exchange student"" table, and she immediately starts to fall for Superman like she's a high school freshman and he's the senior star quarterback. It's very shallow.

Then there's Shazam. Aquaman was in the original comics, which was a nice touch, because with Cyborg in place of the Martian Manhunter, the same team that took on Darkseid also took on Starro the Conqueror in the JLA's first adventure in 1960. But Shazam comes out of nowhere, without any explanation. I know who Shazam is, my online handle is DC_Fan_52, but I'm guessing John Q. Public doesn't know! You'll be left scratching your head why this kid has powers! There's not even a hint of what's going on!

In the end, no matter how good the action is, the weak characters really hamper the movie. I would not want to follow these characters in the future. Do I really want to see Clark and Diana making kiss-y faces at each other? Or see if Batman gives Green Lantern that fistbump that he's practically begging for? Or the Adventures of Captain Where-do-my-Powers-come-from? (Actually I would, I generally like Shazam.)

I'm always open to new interpretations of character, but this opening adventure was noticeably weak. As I've said, an ongoing television series staring these characters is one that would have to move on without me. Thankfully, these moving allow DC not to have to commit to anything, and only suckers like me pay full price to add it to their collection. To everyone else, I say give this a rent, it's not worth the your money or your shelf space. I give Justice League War, Two out of Five stars.",1404000000,,4763,4.806845965770171

The story is very violent(which is a plus) but it seems to be that way only to make up for lack of story.  The whole movie is basically a brawl with Darkseid.

6072392,5,B00GD9GNEY,"In case the subject doesn't give it away, I am a big Justice League fan.  This movie reminds me of the cartoon series in both animation as well as plot which is a good thing.  The story is a little lacking but I think this is mostly due to the short 79 minute run time.

as others have pointed out, this is the ""New 52"" version of the Justice League beginnings so be prepared for some different takes on the characters.  Superman, for example, comes off as a bit of a jerk.

If you can stomach the New 52 (I get heartburn but nothing s Tums won't fix :) then this movie is right up your alley.",1402358400,,593,4.034188034188034

6072394,3,B00GD9GNEY,"This is a decent movie with a substantial amount of action that should please action fans. It has both pluses and minuses in my opinion. The action was satisfying and a few characters got personality upgrades that worked (some did not). Hal Jordan as Green Lantern never had that great of a personality. He was pretty vanilla, but over the years they've made some changes and this cockier, brasher fly by the seat of his pants is an improvement I think. I also found Cyborg's powers and their origins interesting and cool.

However, overall I was somewhat disappointed with this rendition of the Justice League. I have no problem with updating a franchise, and I think it can be tough sometimes to do without alienating older fans. But it felt forced to me. They were trying too hard to be funny, cool and I guess current. Everybody seems to be a clown on this team and much less intelligent than in other past versions of these characters. This isn't the teenaged Justice League after all, that's why there was the Teen Titans. Only Batman and Cyborg seem to be intelligent and reasonably mature. Because of that there wasn't much complexity or differentiation among characters as the creators are trying too hard to get a laugh. I think the biggest turn-off for me was what they did with Wonder Woman. When told that she should remember that she is a diplomat, she rejects that and states she is a warrior. Gone is the Amazon Princess (of certain versions) who was somewhat wise yet inexperienced with the modern world. She stands around getting ice cream with her butt-cheeks hanging out while proclaiming she is proud of her uniform. She then spends quite a bit of time pointing her sword in people's faces when speaking. I guess that's supposed to be comic relief for her character, but it ignores that most warriors wouldn't be waving their weapons around or pointing them at people unless they planned to use them. I cringed with what they did with the character. In short they turned Wonder Woman into a dumb, musclebound, bimbo and I didn't care for it at all.

I know some people weren't happy with Aquaman not being included as a founding member at this time, but I was ok with it and it seems like they might rectify his absence in the future. It also made sense to bring in new blood, which helps give the Justice League franchise a face lift. I think they incorporated Cyborg well into the story and gave good reasons for his origins and from what I recall a significant power boost over the old Cyborg. However, he doesn't have the same iconic quality as the others for me. They did a good job with him and maybe he will grow on me, but its hard to see him as a founding member of the Justice League. So, I'm ok with his inclusion, but not super thrilled.

I didn't care what they did with Darkseid. In the old comics and in some animated versions he is a deeper more frightening being. He comes off here as a more typical overpowered thug. I found that move to be weak, maybe even lazy.

In conclusion, I think this movie is in general a fun action fest with some interesting changes, but there are several other changes that I found questionable.

6072399,2,B00GD9GNEY,"JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR is an animated film based upon DCs New 52 story, Justice League: Origins. Basically, this is a re-telling of how the Justice League was formed according to DCs new 52. In JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR Green Lantern rescues a woman from being kidnapped and chases a creature (that turns out to be a Parademon) that the news media mistakenly believes might be the Batman. Green Lantern almost gets killed, but is saved by Batman. They end up teaming up and follow the Parademon through the sewers where it plants a strange device before dying. Batman and Green Lantern discover the box is alien in origin and set out to question the only alien on Earth they know of: Superman. One thing leads to another and the box turns out to be one of many planted around the world that are set to explode at the same time. The explosion of each of the devices opens an interdimensional portal that becomes flooded with Parademons entering our world. Batman, Green Lantern, and Superman are soon joined by Flash, Wonder Woman, Shazam (Captain Marvel), and the newly created superhero Cyborg. Together they find themselves fighting not only the legions of Parademons, but the master of the Parademons, Darkseid. One would think it would be a global battle, but instead it seems mostly focused in one unnamed city in North America. However, it does go interdimensional when Superman and Batman travel through one of the portals and travel to Darkseids home planet of Apokolips.

In terms of a purely cinematic animated action movie, JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR is fairly decent. Theres a ton of action, lots of fight scenes, and the story is fairly easy to follow.

With that said, you cant really just judge JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR on the terms of an animated action movie. This isn't just an animated action movie. This is an animated action movie about DC superheroes and the founding of the Justice League. These aren't just any characters. These are characters that have been around for a long time (over 70 years for Superman and Batman) and, therefore, the movie must be judged on how each of the major characters involved are treated.

In terms of an animated action movie starring DC superheroes, JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR is an atrocity. It illustrates everything that is wrong with the revamp of the DC universe with the new 52.

Superman  the Big Blue Boy Scout is gone. In his place is an arrogant, self-righteous jock that is a bit of a bully and kind of a meathead. In most of Supermans history, he was someone who was able to keep his emotions under check and was always looking out for other people (Superman would go out of his way to fight enemies away from population centers). In JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR hes extremely emotional, especially when it comes to anger. Not only that, but ****SPOILERS*****Superman kills people in this movie!

Green Lantern  the name of the Green Lantern in this movie is called Hal Jordan, but this is not Hal Jordan. The Green Lantern in this movie is really Guy Gardner because the Green Lantern in JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR acts nothing like Hal Jordan, but acts like Guy Gardner Its never stated, but it is implied that this Hal Jordan has been a Green Lantern for a long time. If thats true, he must be the Keystone Cop of the Green Lantern Corp.

Wonder Woman  the Wonder Woman I was familiar with was not only a beautiful warrior, but she was also highly intelligent and a superior diplomat. Not so in JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR. The Wonder Woman here is still a beautiful warrior, but shes actually not very intelligent, knows nothing about diplomacy, is self-centered, and is a little obnoxious. In this version of Wonder Woman, shes kind of a mean girl jock who seems to have some dominatrix tendencies. For instance, theres a scene where she used her lasso of truth around a man not to gain any critical truth from him, but to publically humiliate him and she takes joy in doing it!

Shazam (Captain Marvel)  in the new DC Captain Marvel is no more and his name has been permanently changed to Shazam. Im okay with that aspect (anyone who has never read comics thinks his name is Shazam anyway). However, what I don't like is the way that Billy Batson is portrayed. Instead of a good-natured and innocent homeless boy, Billy has now been turned into an angry pre-adolescent on the verge of puberty.

Darkseid  Darkseid is one of the most powerful villains in the DC universe. It makes sense that hes used as the main antagonist in JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR. However, although hes the big baddie in this movie, hes not as powerful as one would think. Not only that, but hes completely devoid of any personality. Darkseid is a villain, but hes not a nameless villain without any character. However, in JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR he might as well be a robot created by Lex Luthor.

Flash- Flash seems about normal, but like Darkseid, hes been left without any personality whatsoever.

Batman- unlike almost all of the other characters, Batman is the only character in this new lineup that seems completely unchanged.

In addition, Cyborg is now a founding member of the Justice League. JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR could really have been divided into two parts: the second part could have dealt with the war against Darkseid, while part one could have been titled Cyborg because about half of the movie deals with the new origin of Cyborg.

I have nothing against Cyborg. Hes an interesting character with a good back story. However, he was not and should not have been a part of the founding members of the Justice League. In JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR poor Victor Stone is turned into Cyborg and before he even knows whats happened to him, hes fighting Parademons and flying off to join the other superheroes against Darkseid. He doesnt even know what his abilities are! Its a politically correct move from DC and one that wasn't needed. Not only that, but Cyborgs inclusion means that one of the real founding members of the Justice League gets bumped out of the picture: Aquaman. Despite being one of the most powerful and interesting characters in the DC lineup, Aquaman continues to be made fun of and his exclusion here is just one more mockery.

In addition to all of the changes in the characters, there is an overall difference in tone between the superheroes here and how they have always been portrayed before. The characters are all much more angry than they ever were in the original comics. Anger was mostly the realm of the Marvel universe (Hulk, anyone?) whereas DCs characters were more down-to-Earth and good natured. Not anymore: Superman, Wonder Woman, Billy Baston, and even Cyborg are all very angry.

Not only that, but the characters in this movie cuss a lot. There are several hells, damns, and s***s said throughout the movie. Cussing also used to be a big no-no in the DC world. But, in the New 52, that old adage is long gone. So the big gun, Superman, is no longer the alien from outer space who is supposed to be a Christ-like figure, and instead has been transformed into an angry and lustful warrior who doesnt think twice at killing and who occasionally cusses.

It used to be that other than the violence, a film like this would basically be a PG film. Not anymore. Even if you took out all the violence, JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR would easily be a PG-13 movie because of the language and sexual innuendo that it is filled with.

Overall, although on a purely animated action movie level, JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR has enough to entertain, in the terms of a DC animated movie, it perfectly illustrates everything that is wrong with the New 52.",1401840000,,7553,4.6938775510204085

6072409,2,B00GD9GNEY,"I was very underwhelmed with this animated outing.  Normally I look at the DC animated movies with a sense of warm nostalgia that takes me back to the days of Batman the animated series or the Justice League cartoon.  I will grant that there needs to be some allowance for one-liners, clichs, and cheap animation but I honestly thought that there was far too much of it in this movie.  The violence and content makes me feel like it was made for teenagers and adults but the story and pacing feels more like it is targeted at young kids...the normal time and effort that made these movies enjoyable for an older audience doesn't seem to be in this film.

Your money would be far better spent picking up Batman: Under the Red Hood, The Flashpoint Paradox, or Justice League: Doom.",1400716800,,779,4.542857142857143
6072410,4,B00GD9GNEY,"Great writing makes up for the less spectacular voice acting. Animation and story are all on par with what one expects from DC, and the action sequences are a lot of fun. Green lantern and Batman steal the show for charisma. We liked that Wonder Woman was allowed to be the bad ass we always hope she will be, though her writing was on the goofier side. Superman came off kind of like a caveman because he had so few lines, but everyone else in the pantheon had their moment in the spotlight.",1400457600,,492,4.301075268817204
6072411,5,B00GD9GNEY,"As you probably know this movie is based on the Justice League Origin story (New-52).  One huge difference is the absence of Aquaman and the introduction of Captain Marvel in his place.  I felt the character swap-out worked very well in the context of the story so don't sweat it too much.

The movie has a number of great one-liners from the comic, and overall sticks very much to the storyline.  Which is a great storyline.

The voice-acting is very good, though Kevin Conroy and Tim Daly (or George Newbern who basically sounds exactly like Tim Daly) will forever be the best Batman/Superman voices.  Ever.  Still, I thought Jason O'Mara did a great job as Batman.  He's also in Batman and Son, FYI.

6072417,1,B00GD9GNEY,"This was a total waste of my time and money. As a life-long comic book fan who was even able to adapt to the New 52, I did not enjoy almost anything about this. Maybe the humorous beats that Flash and Green Lantern offered, but otherwise this is totally skippable. The animation is inconsistent, many voices are terrible, plenty of corner-cutting was done with certain scenes' CG, but worst of all was the handling of the characters and story.
Flash was done all right, but as one of my favorite characters, he was underutilized. Wonder Woman was well portrayed but her voice-actor was horrible. Green Lantern was handled well overall and had plenty of time. Superman was a bit too brash for my tastes; I get that he's younger here, but he's still Superman, with the same Super-conscience and sense of justice and morality. Shazam's backstory wasn't fleshed out at all, so seeing Billy's adopted siblings could have been confusing, not to mention he was a jerk until he yelled ""Shazam"". As a huge Batman fan, I was pleased overall but couldn't help but chuckle when he did a bunch of rolls out of Lantern's jet construct, it was unnecessary.
My main beef was with Cyborg. Everything about Victor Stone was done wrong with the exception of him having a distant father and being a football player. Cyborg wasn't exactly a selfish, idiotic brat before his transformation. Seeing him pitch a fit and yank an alien device out of a laboratory machine was quite possibly the dumbest thing I've seen in the DCU. Which even begs the question: why was a child allowed in a high-level government laboratory with alien technology?? My dad used to work in healthcare and I wasn't even allowed past the main desk, let alone all up in his business. And his whole techno-golem transformation was unnecessary. The daddy issues and transformation were handled so poorly.
I'm not sure if I should feel insulted, but this sad adaptation seems like it was geared towards 8 year olds, what with its glaring flaws and shoddy animation. If this is the new standard for DC's animated films then I am no longer a fan and will stick to the comics. Writer Heath Corson should feel no pride in this turd, and I'm sure Jay Oliva did what he could but still fell flat.",1399507200,3,2237,4.665822784810127

Most people who review this know exactly what they are talking about so they might go on and on about pros and cons. I simply saw the movie as it was recommended to me as i was discussing Xmen:Days of Future Past trailer with some friends, and wow, this Justice League movie is incredible.

Personal Dislike: Since this is meant to be the founding of the Justice League leaving out the traditional founders is a bit of a let down for me. I'm a big Hawkman fan and to see his absence and even Hawkwoman's was a let down. Not to mention Martian Manhunter and only a glimpse of Aquaman. I feel this is just the way they're going with the new Batman vs. Superman movie and it's just sad to me. I also dislike Green Lantern as an arrogant jerk as I never saw him that way, it was always The Flash who had more of that attitude.

Non-Personal Like: They did an Okay job of portraying Cyborg who is not one of my favorites and I really enjoyed Wonder Woman's confrontation of her protesters. I also enjoyed the better reactions by normal citizens to all the heroes. The quips between Green Lantern and Batman were pretty enjoyable.",1398988800,,992,4.445054945054945

after the wait was over as soon as my dvd arrived i put in the special features disc to watch the Jim Lee special only to find it wasn't on there, and the special features actually included weren't worth the extra money at all!

the movie itself was a very bad adaptation of (The New 52) Justice League issues 1-6.
some elements of the dialog and story were changed for what seemed like an excuse just to be original, but over-all the story seemed very dumbed down for young kids but there were curse words thrown in so it's hard to tell what audience they were trying to aim toward?
had they not thrown in the swearing i'd say this movie was definitely geared toward young children, because some of the dialog in the film is beyond silly almost to the point of being laughable!
many of the voice performances are also very stale.

6072425,2,B00GD9GNEY,"I'll admit it, I'm 'old-time' when it comes to my mythologies. I'm in my late 50's and have seen endless iterations of Marvel and DC characters over the years. Regardless of the writers' attempts to 'modernize', 're-imagine' or 'make them relevant' the characters' core attributes were retained.

Unfortunately, when DC decided on its 'New 52' initiative, they decided to change everything but the characters' names, and this animated feature is the ultimate case-in-point.

1) Superman has been turned into an arrogant, bullying jock. This is the antithesis of the 'human' person that he is, as a result of being raised as 'Clark Kent'. In a word, they turned him into Guy Gardner. Why not just make Guy the Green Lantern for this film to begin with? Speaking of which....

2) Hal Jordan has been turned into a puerile, preening and ignorant jock. Again...what's the point? 'The Man Without Fear' is clear-headed and has an intuitive sense of tactical battle that meshes with his innate daring to make him a hero. This boob is less an intergalactic policeman, and more like 'Officer Krupke' from West Side Story.

3) Wonder Woman has been turned into a mass of bloodlust and hormones...without the tempering intellect and devotion-to-duty that leavened her warrior spirit. In all fairness, her immediate, physical attraction to Superman has its amusing aspects.

4) 'New God' Darkseid has been re-cast as a generic, grunting bad-guy. His motivation for invading the earth was so non-specific that he may as well have been Mongul or Doomsday for the total lack of personality/leadership/godliness he evidenced. In addition, he shows power/strength that is about 1/2 of the traditional characterization...just so the JLA can graphically put both of his eyes out.

5) Flash is a 1-dimensional straight-arrow, and 'Shazam' (Captain Marvel) is cast with his alter-ego of Billy Batson more of an angry, hormonal teen than an innocent child.

The only one who is recognizable is Batman/Bruce Wayne. Apparently DC's only mainstream cash-cow is sacrosanct.

Finally, the majority of plot and screen time goes to Cyborg...and, this re-imagining of his origin. I have no problem with the character...he's cool/techno/and has interesting baggage. However, he is a secondary character from the DC mythos and not nearly interesting enough to be made a founding JLA member...let alone the focus of this film.

The movie throws in dialog that is too graphic for youngsters, and too moronic for adults. For example, when Wonder Woman used her lasso to compel an antagonist to explain his yelling that she ""...dress(es) like a whore..."", he explains ""...at home, I dress up in a Wonder Woman costume...it makes me feel powerful.' WTF!?

Another serious issue I have is the extreme and gratuitous maiming, gore and cold-blooded killing...by the JLA! Unlike the 'DCU Flashpoint Paradox', the violence/bloodshed in this film serves no purpose...doesn't advance the plot...has no lessons to teach. It's there, simply because the pimple-faced target audience thinks such crap is 'cool'.

Finally, this film continues the DCU march towards a very Japanese style of animation...and, of poor quality. For example, Superman looks as if he's suffering from allergies: his face is lumpy, and his neck is as thick as a water main.

All-in-all, this is a mean-spirited, poorly scripted film with a massive disconnect between the costumes and the personalities who are wearing them. I expect this kind of disdain for the DC characters from the live-action movies (yes, 'Green Lantern', I'm talking to you); but, to see it from the animated division is truly sad.

I really can't find anything to recommend about this film.",1398643200,4,3691,5.193602693602694

The story is good and there is no doubt about that.  It is the way the story is delivered is what gets to me.  The dialogue in the movie isn't that good.  It seems like some of the voice actors aren't into as much as they should be.  Superman and Green Lantern seemed off.  I don't know if they are going for the new 52 change to make the characters edgier or what but it isn't good.  The language.  Look I don't complain too much about foul language and I'm not trying to be a pain but this wasn't what you would expect from the Justice League.  I don't mind one or two light words here or there.  But this was a little over the top in my opinion and I completely feel like it could have been done with out it without taking away from the movie.  You certainly don't want young children watching this.  It isn't filled with it every other word but it is still more than what I would prefer.  I will not let my child watch it so he doesn't pick up words.  Even if the language wasn't bad I would only have given three stars.  The dialogue was just off between characters.  If you're a fan you still may want to watch it but don't get your hopes up.  I'd much prefer Flashpoint paradox over this movie.,1398297600,4,1374,4.136363636363637
6072432,3,B00GD9GNEY,"Overall, this was a good new Justice League story and well worth watching for any fan.

Three stars for small reasons. First, I wasn't a huge fan of the animation. Upon first glance it seems like fairly typical DC animation (which I love), but the longer I watched the more I noticed details that bugged me. Namely that some character's heads/faces looked disproportionately small for their bodies.

Second, I didn't absolutely love all the voice casting. Shemar Moore was fabulous as Cyborg, and I thought Captain Marvel and Flash were good as well. I was hot and cold with Wonder Woman's voice actress, and both Superman and Batman left a little to be desired for me. As for Green Lantern, I suppose I should say I was somewhere in the middle with him; I didn't love his voice at first, but grew accustomed to it easily enough.

Those were my two biggest issues with this film, but as I originally stated, it's certainly worth seeing for any Justice League fan!",1398211200,,963,4.652941176470589
6072433,3,B00GD9GNEY,"I am usually a rip roaring fan of the animated movies that come from the DC universe. I will start off by saying this was visually beautiful. Action sequences were great, character designs were cool, over all the movie looked fantastic. Where it really lacked was in dialogue and character. I can usually put up with some clunky/cliche dialogue from characters I love. But this movie had a double whammy; in addition to the lame dialogue they some how managed to make 4 of the 7 characters sound like Juvenal douchebags the majority of the film.  The dialogue was constantly riddled with words like ""s***"" and ""hell"". I am not one to get on anyone's case for using ""course"", for lack of a better word, language, It just seemed out of place for this movie. It was like they were trying to make them extra ""edgy"" for the sake of it. It just came off like poor writing. ""Vulgarity is no substitute for Wit""  Cest le vie.

It would be great if they would turn this new group into a new tv series like they had in the early 2000's.  Love Wonder Woman but they need to ""add"", not drop Wonder Woman, a different main female character (not Hawkgirl, but like they had Hawkgirl in the earlier series), possibly drop Shazam in favor of another female character.  Walked away from this thinking it was better than either of Marvel's non-animated Captain America or Iron Man movies, and better than DC's much revered recent Batman trilogy of movies (and I loved The Avengers and Man of Steel).

I would have preferred Kevin Conroy as Batman. Let's face it. Conroy as Batman is everything a voice actor should strive for with a character. Would have preferred George Newbern as Superman instead of him playing Steve Trevor.

I'm SUPER disappointed they took Aquaman out and put in Captain Marvel/Shazam. Just not right. Aquaman is way cool in the original story! Cyborg has some truly awesome moments and the moments showing his strained relationship with his father are very powerful. The art style is good and the movie features some cool action scenes.

6072444,1,B00GD9GNEY,"This thing is filled with curse words and blood, obviously aiming for the 13-15 year old crowd. But the writing is still pretty horrendous. Seemingly written by 13-15 year olds, Wonder Woman is reduced to a childish moron who spends the first half of the movie fawning over pink ice cream cones while chilling out in front of the white house with some random little girl who is wandering Pennsylvania Ave after dark all alone. A group of protestors picket her arrival, accusing her of being a bully. So she uses her Lasso of Truth to expose one of them as s cross dresser, and somehow the protesters lose conviction in their goal because I guess the writers think that makes him a bad person. Very unenlightened, and shows a level of ignorance and immaturity that shouldn't be encouraged by DC's iconic super heroes.

Every single hero has a moment where a little kid is awestruck by an act of heroism, as if this movie was made for 4 year olds. Then smash cut to a guy dying brutally. Is this meant to be ironic?  Cyborg's a grown man, but his relationship with his dad is more like a 90s kids movie, with the dad not showing up to his football games because he's a to invested in his own work. Then the dad proceeds to allow his son to prance around this incredibly unstable alien device that they're studying in a laser circle.

The aliens are inconsequential and totally boring. DC has a way of making their villains completely one dimensional, but this film takes it to a new extreme. They're all copies of the same boring armored alien that can fly and punch hard.

Flash looks like William Zabka (the badguy from Karate Kid). Superman has bed head and looks like a giant muscular baby. And Green Lantern will never shut up and stop trying way too hard to be the comic relief.

Batman is pretty cool. But there's a decade of animated source material to base that character on. If you can't make Batman cool, then you're truly hopeless as a writer.

Don't waste your time, this isn't one of the good ones.",1397865600,20,2010,4.478142076502732

6072453,3,B00GD9GNEY,"If you're looking for action, only action, and lots of it, this may be a good choice for you.

I'm a fan of the Justice League, of the New 52 continuity, as well as the issues this movie is ostensibly based upon. I am a fan of the DC Animated flicks and hope they continue for a long time. This, unfortunately, ranks low among the DC Animated collection due to some strange-to-bad creative choices.

Namely, replacing Aquaman with Shazam! stands to be a big disappointment for anyone following the comics, what with Aquaman recently acquiring a kickass persona we were just waiting to see brought to the screen. The way this is presented, the viewer might think that had the Billy Batson/Vic Stone story not been smuggled in, there would have been nothing but fights. While that's pretty much true when looking at the end result, ignoring the potential fun to be had by indulging in the sniffing-out process of the superheroes is a missed opportunity that could have made this much more interesting and unique.

The voice cast for this was about as full of recognizable talent as DCA movies get, but that does not a good performance guarantee. In fact, it might be time for DC to abandon the ""Hey, you're in stuff--ever thought of trying voice work?"" approach to casting. Justin Kirk's Green Lantern is fun, but director Jay Oliva allowed him to get carried a way a few times to where he almost seems a parody of the character. With some guidance, he could be a perfect GL, though.

Michelle Monaghan, whom I believe to be a capable actress, was terrible as Wonder Woman. Godawful. She didn't understand or respect the character, which is not a sin she alone is guilty of among this cast. I know we can't always have Nathan Fillion, Neil Patrick Harris, Kevin Conroy, Lucy Lawless/Keri Russell, et al. voicing our favorite characters but it is essential in casting that the actors be able to respect and understand the content. Some of the performances, particularly Monaghan's, come off as empty caricatures being soft-balled at the audience with a condescending smirk, as if to say ""Here's my impression of a superhero."" The rest of the production backs that up with similar half-assery, by saying, ""Don't worry about all that--look there's an explosion! And Lasers! And an explosion! And another explosion! And another explosion! ...""",1397433600,,2337,4.820448877805486

And I'm certainly not one to be offended by profanity, even when uttered by some of the comic book heroes I grew up with; however, it just seemed gratuitous and high school-ish most of the times it occurred.  I've seen worse, as far as stories go; but of course, I've seen much, much better as well.  And I'm sorry but Darkseid was NOT that powerful in the comics.  Amazingly powerful, yes... but so powerful that this group of heroes would be totally hapless facing him for a good while?  Uh, no.  There were times in the comics where Darkseid and Superman fought one-on-one, and Darkseid had his hands full.

Bring. Back. Those. Days!, sitting in front of a floor model Curtis Mathis with a cable box that had a dial to turn-YES!!!!! Well, fast forward to 2014, and even at the age of 39, I still love the fact the little boy inside of me still knows how to enjoy his cartoons. My wife sometimes gets a little annoyed when I call her my girl, but she still has that girlish quality that seemingly lasts a lifetime & ensures that I will not get tired of her, because I do not need her to be adult, all the time. Not immature, just able to enjoy the love letters I still write to her so she still melts inside & melts me with her smile. ""Will you go with me?"" Check yes or no. Y'all understand, right? Anywho, DC's Justice League: War is time and money well spent. I am not sure if this follows the original mythos of how these characters met, but if not (and I am surprised I do not know this) it is still worthy of your viewing. There has been much talk about Cyborg being included instead of Aquaman, and that conversation is quieted, just be sure to stay tuned as the credits roll. The animation is some of the best I've seen in a while, and the storyline is on point. Superman seems to be much more arrogant that I have ever heard or seen from him, but it does not last long. And was Wonder Woman ever enamored with Kal-El in the past? She is now, which seems to point to their current connection in the comic book featuring them both. DC did a tremendous job bringing forth the conflict that would form them together, but how this will play out with the addition of Aquaman (you know this HAS to happen) is not 'totally' clear.

- Art Work: Superman looked weird
- Characters: Superman seemed a little more roguish than we are used to. . .more grittier and not the ""boy scout"" persona I grew up with.  Green Lantern was to much of a goof and show off, even for Hal Jordan, and the dialogue between him and Batman was just so corny.  And Darkseid. . . please. . . .a total brute with almost no dialogue.  Arg!
- Storyline: Seemed to stray from the original plot of the Justice League (New 52!) plot line and I felt a little disappointed that they tossed in Shazam instead of Aquaman or they could have just left BOTH out and it still would have worked out fine.

6072468,5,B00GD9GNEY,"I have to say that this flick is very tight. Previously, my DC movies favorites had been DOOM & Under Red Hood. Most of the others ranged from good to very good, but often with some distracting quirk. Example: Darkseid''s voice was absurdly tame in APOCALYPSE: in WAR, consider that fixed. Ex: JL:New Frontier had a silly preoccupation with Hal ""seeing the stars."" WAR edits Cyborg's story concisely. I could pick apart something that annoys me from alot of the DC movies, but I won't because they deserve credit for WAR being fantastic, surprising, character-driven, and no-nonsense.
  Because it's a oneoff prequel, every character in WAR is spiked just enough to make them rub against each other. So it's not too usual, yet it satisfies the mold of ""story about heroes doing stuff (& reacting)"". Ex: if you rewatch Flashpoint: Paradox, fine -BUT Batman's not in it much. And the villains are heroes.
  I usually get tired of the hero vs hero device to generate action, but in WAR it worked: and frankly the movie is very funny. Instead of the heroes being overly perfect saying the right highhanded lines appropriately, they're rife with social shortcomings born from their extreme essences. Although the action was invigorating, the humor was paced subtlely and expertly, and never cheap nor tired.
  Although some past movies had peccadillos that make me rip my hair out EVERY time I rewatch them screaming ""why didn't someone nix that!"" , I watched WAR twice in a row, thrilled and satisfied, and will watch it alot, as a meat & potatoes staple for my hearty appetite for witty, not-just-for-kiddies DC heroes animation.",1396569600,,1626,4.916058394160584

The story was admittedly pretty simple, and it is yet another 'the team comes together' story.  That said - it was concise, had great action, and was entirely enjoyable as a stand-alone story.  It may be a little gory for small children (this isn't Super Friends)

The voice acting threw me off a bit as they tend to change from film to film.  Some viewers get cranky when the characterizations aren't 'accurate' - but the reality is these characters are re-imagined over and over.  Superman today may not be the same as Superman from the 40's.  Personally I don't like the changes made to Captain Marvel (know known as Shazam) - but I take the film standalone.

I know this is the ""New 52"" animated Justice League, but maybe the charcaters should have been fleshed out with their own animated features first.  I have always been and will always be a Batman fan and the Dark Knight does not disappoint.  Would have like to see a few other members in here, such as ""Arrow"", but I can wait for the next one.",1396224000,,556,4.257142857142857
6072482,4,B00GD9GNEY,Delivered as early as estimated time. I would like to have Kevin Conroy voice with batman again. Superman and Wonderwoman were one dimensional characters in this film. Felt no depth with them and that they were just added extras. Focused more on the other heroes in the Justice League and once again aquaman was left out.  Other than that i though this was good. They did put a teaser at the end with Ocean Master so hope the next one will feature Aquaman.,1396224000,,456,4.493975903614458

6072486,3,B00GD9GNEY,"The film is fine if you are not too particular about characterization,and film particulars concerning producing and directing.

The WJGroup reviewed this (4 of us), and have given it 3 1/2 Stars.

The ""Superheroes""

GREEN LANTERN is far too arrogant, and the film producers make him look
not very intelligent. The film focuses on him very much.  We like the Green
Lantern.. just not this version of him.

WONDER WOMAN is far too aggressive and is depicted to be so powerful,
she is seen taking hits from the villain ""Darkseid"" that do not deter her, while
one hit from Darkseid knocks out Superman... umm..  (probably to be politically
correct now in these days).  Wonder Woman is very threatening towards an ice
cream man that does nothing to provoke her, yet she pulls her ""sword"" on him.

THE FLASH.. mostly ignored in the film, is probably the most intelligent, and
reasonable character. He is depicted as rather quiet, and was our most favorite
of all the characters in this film.  Flash does nothing to act like a jerk in any
part of this film and stays this way through out the film.

BATMAN, was far too knowledgeable and was depicted as very wise in this film.
He knows more than Green Lantern, as is portrayed as been far too serious
in the film.  We did not like his know-it-all character very well.

SHAZAM or Captain Marvel (originally), is far too childish, and is a big fan of
""victory stone"" (another DC52 character from the 1980s).

SUPERMAN comes off as being far too aggressive at first, but slows down a little
as the film progresses.  The film seems to pair Superman with Wonder Woman -
which was not necessary. Even ""Shazam"" asks Wonder Woman in the film - ""is
that your boyfriend?""...

CYBORG..is 1980 ""teens titans"" character (an invented 1980s DC comic)..that is
given far too much focus on this film. He seems to know everything they (the villains)
are planning and doing. We did not like him on the film.  Another Super hero should
have taken this spot.  If you notice - all the Super heroes are from foundations of the
1930s, 1940s and 1950s.  Yet Cyborg is so unknown, that you would have to read DC
comics really well to know of his existence. Our readers at WJGroup were familiar with all
of the Super heroes - except this character (84 per cent had NOT even heard of him).
Cyborg takes too much credit in this film.

The film is very violent and full of action, some of it is pretty good - especially the
sound effects.

CURSING was totally unnecessary for the film.  This is not for Kids under 12 - especially
if you are trying to raise your kids with MANNERS.  No F words are heard, but much
more is heard like a man calling Wonder Woman a ""Whore"" (or ""looks like a whore"")

ERRORS in the film include DARKSEID looking too big upon entering the film, and then
looking too small later.  He seems to 40 feet tall at first, but later, he seems to be smaller
than some of the Super heroes.

WRITING is bad.. very bad scripting writing. Some times the characters will speak like
they are 9 years old, then speak very intelligently.  Even the President is heard making
low-I Q remarks during a film ending speech.

THE ACTION keeps this film within the limits of watching.  Remember though, it is rated
PG-13, so if you have children that you would rather NOT HAVE LISTENING to foul language,
then, skip the film.  Otherwise, is just Okay.

I have never liked Wonder Woman but good grief, could they make her any more dislikable? The action was good, although I was a little surprised by how violent it was (for an animated movie). The thing going on with Superman and Wonder Woman is stupid. It seems like they're trying to make the content more mature by making it more violent and using more pervasive language but failing miserably because the dialogue is so tacky. Story is fine, animation is standard, but I cringe for the second movie simply because that script was horrible. Trying too hard. Good for a watch but I don't think I'll ever buy the movie.",1395619200,5,906,4.530487804878049
6072501,5,B00GD9GNEY,"This isn't your mom and pop's Justice League... Rather it's reimagining of the the iconic team based the DC New 52 look. The Justice League is based on the magnificent seven (substitute Aquaman for Shazam for it's storyline counterpart and Cyborg for Martian Manhunter for you comic traditionalist out there... In which case you'd probably have to change GL & Flash from Hal & Barry to Kyle & Wally, but I digress) and at it's core is an origin story. Many people have complained about the dark tones and violence DC has been portraying in their movies, but I for one really appreciate it. This isn't the infallible do good era of yesteryear, instead we see classic characters struggle with issues and even react as would any average Joe Schmo. I think this grounds the characters in reality while allowing viewers to identify with them. Yes they are superheroes and yes they should inspire and be role models, but let's be real... The sanctimonious supehero attitude adopted because of comic codes in the 50's & 60's was just as ridiculous and sometimes portrayed the character as shell of their former selves. Anyone who thinks this is too violent hasn't read some of the more essential DC comic book stories out there like DKR, the Killing Joke, the Death of Superman, Identity Crisis, Death in the Family, Emerald Twilight, etc. I personally think that DC is marketing this movie to a more mature audience and anyone looking for a more light hearted interpretation of these characters need to look no further than the CW and Cartoon Network cartoons like Teen Titans Go, Young Justice, the Batman or Legion of Superheroes.",1395619200,2,1626,4.831541218637993
6072502,1,B00GD9GNEY,"I just sat down to watch the DVD Animated Feature JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR.

I have never, in 40 years of watching animation and superheroes, been so disappointed. To say it was ""bad"" is not enough. It is worse than bad - it is beautifully drawn, well-executed TRASH.

It is bad in all the places where it needed to count. It smells like it was written by a 15 year old boy and his progressive cross-dressing step-sister over a weekend while scarfing down Doritoes and Mountain Dew, while talking about how THEY will make all the DC Universe heroes 'really kewl again!'

Puerile and heartless, with all the soul of a mindless barrage of Asian martial arts flick stuck in a loop, it is a film with no redemption, no wisdom, no hope, no character, and no moral fiber. It is an ice cream movie - with all the nutritional value for your soul thereof.

A film that had its so-called ""heroes"" stuck in an egoist/survivalist mode that made me want to find the writer and beat him with the collected works of Shakespeare, my entire collection of Marvel books and my 6 Bible translations until his spine was jelly and he had no more feeling in the tips of his fingers.

I was disgusted, dismayed and deprived of 42 minutes of my life. Check the run-time. Yeah, kids. I cut it short.

I intend to storm the offices of DC comics and personally throttle Jim Lee if this idiotic ""form-over-function"" deconstructionist villainy is permitted to be perpetuated.

Long story short: any @#$$$% episode of Super Friends would have been more fun to watch and better written [from a moral, ethical and plot point of view.]

God save us from this 'new' version of classic ""heroes.""

Gahhhhhh!",1395532800,4,1665,4.597972972972973
6072503,2,B00GD9GNEY,"So....being the comic fan and owner of a huge superhero movie (etc.) collection...I was excited about DCU: Justice League War...this is one of the WORST DC animated movies I've seen. The dialog was snarky at its best, but mostly cliche and at times just flat out stupid.

The fight scenes were over the top, which normally I love, but it was just a constant repeat of arrogant newbies (with I suppose the ""New 52"" DC twist) fighting again and again. Plot was optional, Character Development was nonexistent, and the ""new"" take on Captain Marvel (Shazam), Superman, Green Lantern, and Cyborg was AWFUL. Flash was ""meh"" and Batman was ""ok"".

Wonder Woman was the only saving grace, though I was not hip on her costume and the lust for Superman while Green Lantern, Shazam (a 10 year old boy), and Superman took turns being teenage pervs trying to hit on her or making stupid (did I mention cliche') one liners about her.

Those were the heroes. The villains were worse. Darkseid was drawn to look like Thanos (right down to the color schemes) and somehow became 15-25 feet tall depending on the scene and the artist's lazy interpretation of a character that is supposed to be about 7-8 feet tall at most. Desaad looked like a screwed up Jonah Hex...the Paradaemons...they looked somewhat cool.

Darkseid was also a 1-dimensional boring villain vice the cool aloof interplanetary conqueror that he is supposed to be.

SPOILER (MORE OF A WARNING) - The fact that they stabbed Darkseid in the eyes (Wonder Woman's sword in one and a crowbar in the other) was not only dumb, but insulting to the Justice League...and it didn't slow this now Hulk ripoff from fighting on...though blind...with a 4' sword through his brain...oh and thank you so much 'Man of Steel' - now it is ok for Superman to break alien's necks and kill them...again. He killed Desaad...dont worry, the no-eyed-giant-spazoid-Darkseid lived.

The writers spent too much time TRYING to be witty to focus on a coherent story leaving the viewer not caring which side wins.

I believe this is a taste of what we can expect in the next few DC attempts at live action movies as well. Garbage.",1395532800,5,2148,4.758064516129032

I wanted to love this movie, I truly tried.... because of how well the animation looked, on par with the updated super heroes costumes, the destruction on the environments, the sometimes needed adult language, a great Villain and of course a fantastic introduction to Cyborg's ORIGINS and his suit...

But then, THERE COMES THE STORY AND ITS RIDICULOUS/CHILDISH CHARACTERS BEHAVIOR.....yes I'm talking about all of them with the biggest of all failures to who ever wrote the parts for Wonder Woman and Green Lantern....Obviously those two characters didn't get the right treatment and understanding they deserved.

FYI: If you hated Ryan Reynolds' take of The Green Lantern Movie, the one on this animation would sure make you pull your hair right out.....this character's part was flat out ANNOYING, CHILDISH, AND ABOVE ALL.....Wimpy.

WONDER-WOMAN'S, unfortunately was just a missed opportunity to make this character like-able...every step of the way when the voice actress talked somehow it pulled me out of the experience of whatever good was happening on screen at that moment....oh and let's not forget about how OVER POWERED she was portrait.

As I said, I wanted to love this movie scene after scene, but unfortunately for me, the poor choice of character development  makes this movie one of the worse Justice League Movies I ever watched.",1395446400,4,1548,5.272357723577236

6072514,3,B00GD9GNEY,"As a massive fan of DC animated films this one leaves me deeply divided. What it does well, it does extremely well. However what it does poorly results in some moments that are both painful and boring. It'd be easier to let the faults go if this wasn't the start of a new DCAU (DC Animated Universe) continuity.

Starting with the positives: the action scenes are well planned an executed. They're exciting to watch and well paced. Given that most of the combat is against the somewhat generic and identical parademons, it's high praise that it doesn't leave you burned out by the end. Most of the voice cast works very well, and the characterizations of most of the characters is familiar while being just slightly different from what most fans have seen on screen so far. Shazam is a surprise highlight in this regard.

However, while most of the characters work very well there are two glaring exceptions. The first is the villain Darkseid. While the film does a good job of showing his raw power, he comes off as extremely generic. There's none of the mastermind scheming that makes him more than just a big brute, and for this reason he could just as easily have been swapped out for any number of other hulking baddies. His dialog is also generic supervillain drivel, not that it matters because mostly he only grunts and shouts.

The film also shares the ""Man of Steel"" film's disregard for collateral damage. While it's fair that plenty of buildings were going to be obliterated in this conflict, none of the heroes seem to have any concern about this happening. This means that fans of Superman who were irritated by his apparent apathy at the lives put in danger by his fighting in a city will have the same criticism here.

The biggest offense however is Wonder Woman. She is very poorly written, given nave and grating dialog throughout. It's probably meant to be funny but it just never plays as anything other than irritating. The overly enthusiastic performance of Michelle Monaghan makes it even worse. She exudes none of the stoic strength that made so many of the previous animated takes on the character so powerful. And hinting at an almost immediate attraction to Superman only serves to cheapen her further.

There's plenty that works here, with stellar action and most of the characters having good chemistry (I could watch Green Lantern and Batman bicker all day long.) However the things that aren't working aren't just minor nitpicks, they're fundamental flaws. And some of them are ones we're going to be stuck with for future DCAU releases, which for the first time ever removes my excitement at future adventures of Wonder Woman.",1395273600,2,2658,4.7821350762527235

I didn't give it 5 stars simply because I felt the voice acting wasn't very convincing as strange as that may sound for all the main characters, it was either that or the script itself.

6072529,5,B00GD9GNEY,"YES! This movie was fantastic. It is only 1 hour 20 minutes long and they had to basically introduce each character and give them a basic story line. This movie gives each of the characters the same amount of screen time and does it very entertainingly! LOTS of action and DARKSEID never disappoints as a SUPER VILLAIN! This was really well done and the banter is fantastic. The quality of cartoon is really good compared to some of the garbage I've been seeing. Any time you deal with EPIC Comic characters you get tight wad reviewers who say this or that ISN'T RIGHT. So if your into details THAT'S WHAT COMICS ARE FOR, READ! But if you want a Movie THIS IS IT! Some people are talking about voices of who these characters ""who are comic book characters and don't exist"" SHOULD SOUND LIKE??? They need to get a life.

6072534,2,B00GD9GNEY,"The DC universe has done well for itself, creating animated versions of various arcs throughout its entire catalog, but given the fact that this story, the birth of the Justice League, has been told 4 times (if you count Young Justice) in the last decade, all with startlingly similar results, if varying degrees of quality. With so many Justice League stories I'm hard pressed to find a reason to even retell this one, especially given the fact that this is only slightly better than the sprawling, bloated Justice League: the New Frontier. I get that the purpose was to set up a new cinematic universe (according to James Tucker, a producer on the project), but like so many other stories, is it really important that we reimagine it? Couldn't we have just skipped this part and moved straight into the league having been involved in global operations for some time. You know, actually starting afresh with the story instead of rehashing old ones with old ideas and mediocre character work (for this movie, the characters are strong but they were mishandled here).

That's not to say there aren't strengths, the dialogue between the characters (aside from superman and wonder woman, who both stand out as stupid brutes, despite their actor's best efforts) is top notch for the most part. And the voice acting is similarly spectacular throughout the rest of the main cast as well, but lesser characters, including the film's main villain tend to get the short end of the stick. Darkseid,traditionally a villain reserved as both a foil and physical villain for superman, is relegated to the role of ""just another world dominating villain"" in this movie, and the voice acting is masked by a voice modulator belonging in a child's toy.

As far as characters go, each of the cast tends to come off as embittered, territorial and childish. There characters have changed so much since the days of the Justice league tv show or even Young justice from 2 years ago, that they're hardly recognizable. Superman's 'boy scout' nickname is hardly fitting here, as any recognizable relationship to humans is destroyed under the crushing weight of his ego, forcing the question of why he even helps people, because he can? Because what happens when this version of superman gets bored? Shazam, Captain marvel's renamed form is also changed. Intended to be a boy of pure heart bestowed with the power of a wizard (whose name was Shazam) He was later conformed to be a mirror for superman, showing him how far he'd moved from his original, hopeful self. But here he's simply a child given power without the maturity or wherewithal to know how to properly use it. There are similar character changes for others, including Green Lantern's lack of actual power to match even that of characters like batman, who seemed to hold his own better than a guy who commands a mystical ring designed to let him police an entire planet by himself (green lantern); or wonder woman who, like superman is just a warrior looking for her next big fight, and not the mostly clear thinking, wise, and mature, if somewhat hotheaded characterizations of previous incarnations.

Indeed the only characters they seem to have done absolutely right are Batman, who has the benefit of everyone knowing who he is, and the Flash, who is actually handled with respect as someone who isn't just the dumb fratboy/comic relief that he was in previous showings. But, that being said, all I can say about this is that anyone looking for a meaningful addition to their collection should be wary of this one, and that I hope that the next addition is better.",1394841600,3,3604,4.837925445705024

I don't understand this ""new"" retelling of the DC universe. For well over fifty years, no matter how many changes there were, the basic ideas held true and everyone remembered them, now it's all changed..WHY?? This is better then Flashpoint as far as plot and story and even characters go..except for Captain Marvel..this is wrong very very wrong..makes no sense at all, this brat would never have been picked to be Captain Marvel, strange thing is he's not in the books. The art work is very good, there are a great many scenes that are truly beautiful, while the character designs are still the same as they were in Flashpoint (kind of remind you of Sting from the movie Dune)...Jim Lee's work is very epic in the books, but he does suffer  quite a few panels that are just explosions of color and make little sense, the animation here is more contained and easier to view...very pleasing to the eyes. The story is fuller, but it is after all just slugfest and doesn't need much of a story..bad guy comes to conquer the world and the good guys just pound him back to his world..you know in the past Superman has been known to do this all by himself. Because of this new reworking there isn't much to admire about these new ""heroes"". Flash and for sure Batman do ""shine"" however so there is hope for a ""better world"" and maybe just maybe they (DC) will return to the ""old ways""...one can only hope.",1394668800,3,1524,4.521739130434782

Comics used to have great creative stories that were entertaining. Now a days like this movie, it's ""we have to make this dark, graphic and dumb down the characters so our edgy young people will like it"". To prove you can clean it up and still make it good for everyone look at ""Young Justice"" or ""Batman the Animated series"". The movie was the same old ""Darkside taking over which is fine but why so gory?The Heroes I grew up with would never try to kill the bad guy in such a horrific fashion , Do you really need it to be PG13? And I didn't recognize the heroes. 1. Green Lantern was weak and clueless 2. Wonderwoman was a wound up soldier only living for battle 3. Superman was an arrogant Bully. 4. Captain Marvel , oopps I mean Shazam was a cocky teenager. Only Batman was somewhat the Batman I recognized. I hope that DC will put out more movies like JLA Adventures Trapped in Time (only better animation please) for the rest of us. Didn't like the new costumes on Superman and Wonderwoman.

Having Shazam put in his place does beg the question is DC ashamed of him? Or just (as usual) like to shake things up and make unnecessary changes to things? Whatever the case all in all this is a solid pick up seeing them all come together for the first time if you will and watch them work as a team after just meeting.  The chemistry amongst them all is interesting an how the all meet up as well.  The cast is good, not the ""great ones"" we all know and love i.e. Kevin Conroy, Tim Daly or Michael Rosenbaum to name a few.  But if you've been watching the other DC movies I'd pick this one up, it is a good one. Try not to compare it to the others....not fair lol.  Just sit back and enjoy the action and characters.

If you use to enjoy the justice league and justice league unlimited shows.  You'll Likely enjoy this as well.  The story does not follow the old tv shows, but that's the point.

6072552,1,B00GD9GNEY,"I was extremely disappointed in this film. It seemed like a rushed project that was barely even half-baked before release.

Positives:

1) artwork and animation was decent... nothing superior, but decent

Negatives:

1) Voice acting... it just didn't work. Batman sounded strange and forced... everybody else sounded low-budget and over-dramatic. I did not care about any of the characters.

2) Writing... HORRIBLE. Terrible dialogue, a corny soul-searching conversation between Batman and Green Lantern on how they are just ""normal people"". Green Lantern and Super Man come off as total jerks, Wonder Woman was a complete moron, and the argument/tension between Cyborg and his dad was not the slightest bit believable. Shazam was just a loser. The only one that was somewhat true-to-character was the Flash. Boring dialogue, and on top of all this:

3) Language... c'mon! That's pathetic writing. Think for two seconds from a business standpoint... if you write a good story, it will appeal to fans of all ages. I am 35... love comics and super hero stories. I have an 8 year-old boy... even if this movie was any good, I would not show this to him for it's use of ""hell"", ""damn"", ""a$$"", etc. There was 3-4 uses of these words in the first 3 minutes of the movie. That is lazy writing and a lame attempt to be ""edgy"".

Not buying it DC... this project sucked, and you are looking more desperate every month while Marvel wipes their butts with $100 bills from the success of their ""vision"".

You have great characters that are loved by millions... do something great with them with both live-action and animation!!!

What was once the realm of innocent fun is now mean-spirited, bleak, and angry. And this little piece of animated nastiness constitutes the final destruction, the Super-Jumping-Of-The-Shark for the DCU, if you will.

Everybody is off-model. Especially Superman, whose new costume, hairstyle, and personality are unrecognizable and totally unappealing. I would quote some of the other superheroes' dialog here (such as The Flash and Green Lantern), however Amazon would not publish my review if I did (no, I am not joking). Maybe Wolverine would use foul language, but Green Lantern?! And Wonder Woman waving a sword in everybody's faces? Wonder Woman?! Oh, and just for the sake of charm, when she first appears, an onlooker accuses her of dressing like a whore. Yep, they actually use the word Whore. Welcome to The New DC!

There is an abundance of unnecessary language that may be acceptable for an adult audience, but definitely not for young children. The fights are also slightly more adult oriented, being very graphic compared to some of the old superhero animated movies.

Aside for the not so kid friendly aspect of this, the story is lacking severely. SPOILER: the heroes were ultimately incapable of beating the villain, Darkseid. Even after severely injuring him, he was still so powerful that their only option was to send him away to his home planet in an act of desperation. Of course they can send him away, but usually its after a victory in which Darkseid flees or is sent away in some form of defeat.

Aside from the not so kid friendly aspects and the bad story, it is almost like the makers did not understand their own characters. With all due respect, GL is portrayed more like the Flash, Shazaam just was not Shazaam, Wonder Woman is kind of portrayed as an idiot, Superman has a bit of an ego problem, Batman is ok, Cyborg.....

I know that comics can only reflect of the culture due to the fact many of its writers are not Christians.  Therefore they cannot serve as a beacon of salt and light in debased culture.

6072567,5,B00GD9GNEY,"I never would have imagined that the DCAU Films post Bruce Timm would be where it is today. I have said time and time again that I had no idea where this film library was going to go after The Dark Knight Returns. Apparently, there is a much darker world beyond that film and we have been seeing it ever since.

'Justice League:War', is a loosely based sequel of 'Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox' in which we see the after math of the The Flashes journey to save the world. Now we are given a Justice League like we have never seen before. Each of these characters that you know and love are suddenly no longer friends and all of them have personalities that you would have never expected. While Batman is still the paranoid strategist that he has always been, he is accompanied by a self centered Green Lantern, boy scout Flash, careless Wonder Woman and let's not forget big bully Superman. This film also has the pleasure of giving us a great origin story of Cyborg, much like what 'Justice League: New Frontier did with Green Lantern and Martian Man-Hunter. We also have Captain Marvel in the mix voiced by non other than Sean Astin who adds some great one liners and action.

This film is darker, with a whole bunch of new foul words that have never been used in the DCU films yet. The story is just one big fight with a plot, but gritter and with fewer slow points like in Batman/Superman: Public Enemies. It has a villain that everyone loves, plenty of surprises and a Marvel Film Universe-esque ending.

This film library is going on 20 films this year with two more exciting stories on the way featuring non other than Batman.

Now that I've watched it, I have to say I was a bit underwhelmed.  Not much depth to the characters (except one), slightly subpar animation in the facial emotions but average for action sequences and the swearing was totally unnecessary.  I do like the Batman/Green Lantern dynamic although they made GL an attitude more than a character.  Wonder Woman was laughably flat and I just wasn't digging Capt. Marvel's goofy voice or ending.  I'll definitely watch this again down the road but it's low on the list.  I do wish Warner Bros. concentrated on bring these characters' faces to life.  They seem to be getting stiffer and simpler with each movie.",1393977600,,780,4.819548872180451

6072588,4,B00GD9GNEY,"I just saw this yesterday when it arrived from Netflix.  Since I completely panned Flashpoint Paradox, I thought it was only fair to give a review on this one, which I found to be a much more enjoyable movie than the last one.  There was a time in my life when I read a lot of comic books, but that has not happened in the last twenty five years. So most of the new developments in either Marvel or DC is something I look up in Wikipedia when I feel like doing so, as I feel that these movies should be judged on their standalone merit.

First of all, the animation was different and also about a dozen times better than their last effort at a Justice League movie.  It was almost as good as the Young Justice TV series, which I consider to have the best, most realistic animation of any animated superheroes program I've ever seen.  Before I proceed, there will be some spoilers in this review, so you are warned.  According to other reviews, this is taken from the first few issues of their rebooted JLA series.  I also realize that you can't tell everything in an 80 minute movie, so that's not a problem.  The movie moved along acceptably and there were no blaring gaps in the movie as it was presented.  My main gripes with the movie are the way some of these characters are presented.  I felt that Batman, Flash, and Cyborg were portrayed acceptably (I reiterate that it is nice to see the Flash portrayed like a responsible adult). I also thought that the character development with Cyborg was particularly well done.  I also feel that Green Lantern was portrayed like far more of an arrogant punk then he should have been.  Can someone please explain how an angry little stealing brat like Billy Batson (as portrayed) could become Captain Marvel?  That makes no sense to me at all, and it makes his character somewhat unbelievable in this presentation.

Now we come to the nitty gritty; Superman and Wonder Woman.  The blue boy scout is obviously the most iconic superhero in the world but as presented his character flaws were quite startling.  The so called fight between Superman and Batman & Green Lantern was probably more accurate than anything else presented before, providing you are dealing with a Superman with no compunction about hurting people weaker than himself.  The most unbelievable part to me is why Batman, who always knows everyone else inside out, did not have some kryptonite insurance to stop Superman if need be.  I agree with other reviewers that a partial loss of innocence in the big guy is probably not such a bad idea, but it seemed too much here.  As for Wonder Woman, frankly, I am starting to wonder if some person(s) on the production staff don't have domestic issues, considering how she has been presented in the last two JL movies.  She behaved like a spoiled arrogant over the top feminist brat from start to finish, and for someone who is supposedly millennia old, this is not a compliment to her character, although I found the ice cream scene hysterical. She behaved a bit too macho most of the time (although I freely admit Captain Marvel really had it coming).  Another thing is that her constant use of the sword and more importantly the emphasis on blinding Darkseid, while admittedly tactically wise, was a bit much for a movie which, again, will be seen by mostly kids, so frankly I think parents should use some caution in letting kids of a certain age watch this movie.

All in all, it was a serious step up in the quality of DC's animated movies.  It is to be hoped that if any other JLA movies are made, less friction, profanity, and gore, and more character interaction, improvements in animation and voice selection will make these movies more enjoyable that some of the latest ones.  I felt that this was a movie that I would enjoy watching again, and I do recommend it, although caution should be used with respect to young viewers and certain scenes in the movie.",1393977600,,3927,4.585121602288984

Thats not the Hal Jordan some of us are use to.  I know this is based on the new 52 and im not familiar with those comics, but this movie has sparked my intrest and i might buy a couple to read up on it.  Its not a bad movie.  good fights and i love the ending.  I believe its worth it for any comic/superhero fan.

But it was missing something, in which I can't specifically give an answer to. One thing I didn't like about it is that Superman's character was out of place. He was not the goody two shoes we all know him to be. Took away from the authenticity of him.

6072604,5,B00GD9GNEY,"For those of you who don't get it, this is a pseudo retelling of the first story arc from the DC Comics New 52 Justice League (sans Aquaman). Other than leaving out the worlds most awesome aqaurian, this is a pretty straight retelling of that story, right down to the dialogue. This ""new"" Justice League (these, ahem, Super Friends) make their debut against Darkseid as he tries to teraform Earth. A fun adventure and a look at the direction DC may be taking a lot of their animated stuff. Green Lantern and Flash steal the show, but what else is new (they can be the most compelling of the group from time to time). Any fan of JLA will enjoy. Note, this is not for children due to language and some graphic violence (even for a cartoon).",1393718400,,738,4.394160583941606
6072605,4,B00GD9GNEY,"I've always been a fan of the DC Animated Universe since ""Batman: The Animated Series"" in the 90s. When it comes to superhero comics adaptations, I think animation is a better medium than live action. ""Justice League: War"" is the latest release from DC and Warner Bros. animation and I liked it so much that I will list 5 things I loved about ""Justice League: War"" and 2 things I disliked. First, the dislikes.

2. Actually this is more of a warning than a dislike. It's PG-13 so there's a lot of slicing, hacking and a gory discretion shot of an alien being ""transformed"" into a parademon. Not for the faint of heart or for very little children. Also, some swear words. And it's not just ""damn"" and ""hell"". Also when Superman releases the prisoners that were to undergo this transformation,only humans were seen. We never find out what happened to the aliens that were abducted as well. What happened to them? We're they already transformed? Did any escape? I may be human but I care about the welfare of aliens too.

1. There are six male superheroes and only one superheroine. Why does Wonder Woman always have to be the only woman among men. I wish another heroine was added to the group, like Black Canary or Vixen or Big Barda or maybe even Katana. If the Smurfette Principle in this film bothers you, I recommend ""Superman/ Batman: Apocalypse"" (It has 3 female superheroes and it passes the Bechtel Test).

Now for the likes:

5. It has Captain Marvel. Captain Marvel is my third favorite superhero and he often gets overlooked by the more ""hip"" serious superheroes. I love it when there are stories in the DCAU that involve ""Shazaam"".

4. In ""Justice League"" and ""Justice League Unlimited"" The Flash was the doofus and Green Lantern had more sense. Now it's the other way around.

3. Believe it or not Batman and Green Lantern have something in common. I won't tell you what.

2. ""Ice Cream is Wonderful!"" Wonder Woman gets some of the best lines in the movie and some of the funniest moments. Her overconfidence and the way she bonds with a little girl in one scene makes her one of the most memorable characters.

1. If you heard what Mr. Djimon Honsou said at Comic con 2013, I hope that he and his son will watch this movie because it has Vic Stone, a black football player who gets injured badly by Darkseid's parademons and, with medical help from his scientist father, becomes Cyborg, one of DC's most prominent black superheroes. Cyborg has also been in ""Justice League: Doom"" and ""Teen Titans"".",1393718400,,2511,4.614349775784754
6072606,3,B00GD9GNEY,"I own many DC movies and the JL/JLU series.  Darkseid is always an excellent foe.  However, compared to Batman/Superman:Apocalypse, the plot is lacking in creativity with unnecessary gore to cover up these holes.  To be honest, I got a little bored watching it. The movie is not so awful that I regret buying it and I would watch it again but definitely not my fave.",1393718400,2,366,4.6
6072607,5,B00GD9GNEY,"I was very happy with Justice League: War. Once I understood that there were all new voice actors (right around the five minute mark or so), I sat back and enjoyed the ride! As much as it pains all of us to watch something we love change over time, I think that kind of evolution is necessary to pull in the next generation of fans. Lots of action, great dialogue, and a surprise nod during the credits to one of the JL members I thought was overlooked. In addition, I think Shemar Moore did an outstanding job as Cyborg- I hope he returns in DC's future offerings. His voice work offers the potential to do for Cyborg what Kevin Conroy did for Batman in the 90's. I look forward to whatever they're coming out with next!",1393632000,,721,4.3088235294117645
6072608,1,B00GD9GNEY,"This JLA movie was not made for an audience who remembers when comic books were less than $1.00.  I thought it was like most of the modern superhero movies: short on story, heavy on action/fighting/explosions, accented with awkward humor/flippancy, and some stronger-than-usual language.

6072611,5,B00GD9GNEY,"I want to start by saying I'm not a comic die hard. I've been reading them off and on all my life but not as invested as some. I have great respect for the original origins,this as I understand it is based on the new 52 which I believe is a retelling of the DC universe of sorts. Which would make this a Justice league origin story. I believe it works. It isn't perfect some places the plot is a little thin but I was entertained and felt that some of the snarkyness the characters showed fit in a retelling of this Universe. I would like to touch on Wonder Women a bit (because I've always loved her so much). I felt she was bad a**!! Was she a bull in a China shop and could have been developed much more. Yup. Hopefully that happens in a feature of her own. But I feel alot of reviews put their own PC garbage into  the story of an Amazon warrior princess in a tight outfit. Look Wonder Women walks into a room people are gonna notice. As a couple members of the team obviously did. It just mean they are alive..lol ... It wasn't some prev fest as I recall one website describe it. They cram alot into this and not everyone got the full blown treatment but it seems like this is a setup for more focused stories in the future and I'm all for that.

The animation wasn't great, but the lines were funny (lots of humor) and it had an ""adult"" edge to it all.  Tons of action and super power usage which is pretty much why you watch super hero movies... so good there.

6072616,2,B00GD9GNEY,"While I'm usually a sucker for the DC Universe cartoon movies, this one was a stinker. The voice acting was wooden, especially for Wonder Woman, which made some of the dialogue, poorly written itself, sound all the worse. The writing left a lot to be desired, with characters like Green Lantern behaving like an undisciplined, whiny, brat; not how one might expect a military officer known for his Willpower to behave. Captain Marvel was added to the story in place of Auquaman for no clear reason, and he did not have ""Wisdom of Solomon""...he had a horrible, egotistical personality.

6072621,1,B00GD9GNEY,"Basically it's just a fight scene, I give credit to the animators for doing a good job and the voice acting is decent, but the people at DC Animation had very little to work with, it's obvious this is simply an hour and ten minute commercial for the new 52 which does have some decent stories but Justice League Origins simply wasn't one of them. It's usually a hit or miss with Geoff Johns, his stories are sometimes interesting and well thought out like Flashpoint, or they'll just be some incredibly mediocre manifestation of what his idea of the characters are rather then what other writers have been doing for decades.

My biggest problem with this movie and the story in general is the way all of the characters are portrayed, Green Lantern just stole Guy Gardners personality because Hal doesn't have one of his own, Superman acted like a robot with no humanity, Batman just yelled at everything and spat out generic Batman lines that seem like they were taken from some bad fanfiction. Wonder Woman is indeed a wonder as I don't even know what to make of her character, she seemed like she was taken straight out of a really bad anime, Flash made so little an impact in the story I had almost forgotten he was in it, and why oh why is Cyborg in the Justice League? Batman has always been the tech guy, this is obviously another one of Geoff John's schemes to make Batman seem even more useless (Incase you don't know, Johns is one of the worst writers Batman has ever had and that stems from the fact that he simply doesn't like Batman that much)

I'm not hating on this movie because its based on the new 52, it's simply extremely mediocre, I don't think they even explained Darkseids plan or why he was doing what he did, he could have been the good guy for all we know. There are much better stories from the new 52 they could have adapted into a film. For what it's worth the animation is good and the voice acting is good, they simply didn't have anything to work with story-wise.",1393459200,4,1994,4.430517711171662
6072622,4,B00GD9GNEY,"Having read DC comics for many, many years, I tire of the Big Two always having to retell the same old origin stories over and over and over and.... Yuk!

I did not mind the way this film was put together. Wonder Woman is more haughty and arrogant. And puzzled about the ways of Man and the USA. Green Lantern comes across as a smart-aleck, brash and tough. I think the scriptwriter took a page (unfortunately) from the last Green Lantern movie. Hal Jordan is not that bad. As for Batman, well, he's Batman.

Superman and the rest meet each other for the first time. The humor of that meeting is cut short by an invasion of creatures send over through the Boom Tube by Darkseid. The Parademons are not invincible and fall to the heroes, but there's just too many of them.

I did enjoy the substory of Cyborg's origin and his struggle with his father, who is ""too busy"" to see his son's football game. Unfortunately parents do screw up their priorities and this film makes that point well.

Shazam was quite a deviation of the original Fawcett character and was not done that well. Billy Batson is not a radio announcer (excuse me while I age myself) but is an orphan. The orphanage is not played up well at all, and his family/friends are not really much in this film.

Overall, not a bad foray into the JLA world. Looking forward to more adventures. Based on a Geoff Johns story.

Here's the Wiki version: Justice League: War is a direct-to-video animated superhero film, an adaptation of Geoff Johns and Jim Lee's 2011 Justice League: Origin storyline.

6072624,4,B00GD9GNEY,I saw some scenes of this movie on youtube and couldn't stand it not seeing the whole thing. so i rented it. Its a fun movie to watch and i only have 4 stars because I want to leave room in my ratings for a movie that is spectacularly awesome. This was a good comic movie though.,1393459200,,279,3.912280701754386

6072626,2,B00GD9GNEY,"I have collected DC Character toys and movies (big and small screen) and have to say this is my least favorite of my collection.

The dialogue was childish (specially Green Lantern).  What surprised me was the use of foul language throughout the movie which came across as an attempt to add a sense of maturity to the show.  Instead of adding maturity, it created an unclear message/direction of what the movie attempted to do.  I understand the DC Universe has a wide and diverse audience, however; as a long time fan I am very disappointed.  After a few minutes into the movie, I disconnected from the story.

Another disappointment was the preview section of movies that are in the works.  I'll say it once again - Another Batman Movie????  I like Batman very much but how many Batman movies do we have to see when the DC Universe is so darn Big?  I'm tired of seeing Batman in the Big and Small Screen.  I'm anxious to see other DC Characters flourish.  The same can be said of Marvel Comics which I'm also a fan of.  In their case, I'm tired of Wolverine.

I remain a fan of the DC Universe and look forward to more of their of work.  I'm just hoping that new work will shed light on other characters and let some of the old ones (Batman) rest.",1393459200,2,1249,4.373913043478261

6072628,5,B00GD9GNEY,Great movie. Shows the coming together in the beginning to create such a powerful team. Would def watch it again,1393372800,,112,4.65
6072629,3,B00GD9GNEY,"First off, let me be honest.  I don't like the vast majority of the nu52.  I don't like how Flashpoint created this new DC Universe (hasn't the constant rebooting since 1985's Crisis been done ENOUGH?), and I don't like a lot of the designs.

Superman's iconic costume is the most changed of the lot, done to avoid lawsuit and owing money to the original creators.  Darkseid is also vastly changed (and IMHO not for the better).  Here he doesn't come across like a force of nature, but more like a roaring monster.

The animated DCU features have never shied away from violence, but this seemed a bit gratuitous in stabbing out Darkseid's eyes.  Now, I've only skimmed the original Justice League arc this comes from, so maybe that is accurate, but it was shocking -- even more shocking that the Flash, Barry Allen, puts out his second eye.  This is not the pre-Crisis Flash, certainly!

There isn't a lot of characterization here, either.  Basically, Batman is the ever-prepared Bat-God, Wonder Woman is almost a parody of the warrior, Green Lantern is a buffoon to be laughed at, and Superman is a pompous jerk.  Shazam/Captain Marvel is still the kid in a grown-up body, and Cyborg hasn't been anything like the Wolfman/Perez Vic Stone in years, so his persona here isn't really defined much beyond an origin story and being conveniently able to provide exposition.

I know the DCU movies tend to be short, but this one seemed even shorter insofar as it just jumped from point to point willy-nilly.

I didn't HATE this, not at all, it just wasn't really my style, and the lack of development (and what little we DID get seems to indicate most of these people are not fun to be around) seemed to stick out more than most of their releases.

If you loved the original nu52 Justice League this is based off, you will almost certainly like this release.  However, I actually HATED the Flashpoint comics, and the animated version of that was more entertaining (again, IMHO).

If you're expecting the old Cartoon Network Justice League, the Batman:TAS or Superman:TAS, or even the characters as seen in things like Crisis on Two Earths (it and The New Frontier are probably my absolute favorites of the releases), you are going to be surprised if not disappointed.

I again won't say this is a bad release, just a bit abrupt.  The animation and voice-acting is well done, but the characters aren't well developed, or so radically different from what they used to be, that they really should have been new character entirely.

Enjoy!",1393372800,,2529,4.745995423340961
6072630,5,B00GD9GNEY,Great story telling and the action was well done. They characters looked modern and of course batman is forever the badass. I am going to be watching this again 100%.,1393372800,,166,4.566666666666666

6072636,5,B00GD9GNEY,I actually chose this rating because there wasn't a 4.5 out of 5 stars the only reason I don't give it a full 5 Stars in my mind is I didn't like some of the writing I felt that man should have had a better role and enable to defend himself better from super fan / Clark Kent,1393286400,,275,3.7586206896551726
6072637,5,B00GD9GNEY,"I watched it a few times, It was fun to watch the Justice League origin again. I enjoyed the story as much as Doom.

The art was really well done, the voice acting was good.

I will be watching it again, as it has some twists that I missed.

On the minus side, they are retelling the same story that has been told, the origin of the J.L.

Maybe some new tales like Under the Red Hood which next to Dark Knight was the best video so far made.",1393200000,,441,3.9213483146067416

6072639,4,B00GD9GNEY,"I got this view and while I was curious about the new reboot wasn't about to shell out money for the comics.  I watched it and it wasn't that bad.

They were enthralled and excited the entire movie. Gotta admit..I was skeptical, but I was sucked in as well, playing the 'who is that gonna be' game, and laughing at the awesome dialogue and exchanges. It has become one of our favorites. If you are a major stickler about cursing, they say Hell, Damn and the 'S' word 2-3 times.. it's barely noticeable because of it's use but I thought I'd warn you anways. :) Worth owning. Worth renting if you are too poor to own. :D",1393200000,,605,4.353982300884955
6072641,5,B00GD9GNEY,"This movie is an iteration of DC's ""New 52"" this is the Justice League the way it is now, except for one big difference which I don't understand. We have Shazam instead of Aquaman. I love Aquaman and don't see why the change but I'll go with it. (Maybe DC will do a movie with only Aquaman, hint, hint) I love the portrayal of Green Lantern, this is how he is now in the new 52, cocky and arrogant and a definite wise guy. His interaction with Batman is hysterical. I love all the characters and did feel this was terrific...one complaint (well, besides no Aquaman) Darkseid is a great villain but the Justice League was constantly fighting his Parademons, again and again and again, you get the picture until finally we took on the big bad Darkseid himself....very cool and lots of fun.",1393200000,,787,4.472222222222222
6072642,4,B00GD9GNEY,"I love pretty much all these DC animated movies. This one is no exception. It's PG-13 so if you think that superheroes in animated formats are always for your children, think again. This one is for you :). And it is goooood!!!",1393200000,,226,4.404761904761905
6072643,3,B00GD9GNEY,"I found it to be enjoyable, but the use of swear words was a real downer. I let my 6 & 4 year old watch it with me. I didn't think that it would be that big of a deal since its about Superman/Batman and others. But I found myself cringing every time someone swore. And honestly it didn't add anything to the story or make you feel anything more or less for the characters. It's okay to make it more realistic but remember kids want to watch these movies to. I will be screening them from now on before letting my kids watching. Kind of sad I have to do that.",1393200000,,558,3.9910714285714284

Sure it is not as dramatic and as complex as that one. This one is funny! Just hilarious! I love the characters! The animation was also awesome!

I love the fact that I was able to rent the video from Amazon! This is just too cool! Can't wait for more videos! I wonder what will happen in the sequel! I hope it does not take too long.

6072657,1,B00GD9GNEY,"Hated the re-working of the characters.  If this is the ""new 52"" they can have it.  Billy Batson is a juvenile delinquent?  Green Lantern is a moron and an ego-maniac?  Superman and Wonder Woman have the hots for each other because they are both pretty and strong?  There is very little plot and practically no story.  The only characters one can care about at all are Batman, Flash and Cyborg - even with his badly re-written origin story.  Watching this, I was reminded of the video-games that have storylines - a lot of action and a barebones plot.  Actually, the ""Injustice"" game had twice the plot of this.

If this is the new DC, make mine Marvel.",1392940800,4,653,4.512820512820513
6072658,4,B00GD9GNEY,"I bought this a few weeks ago and I have watched it about 4 times. When I watch a super hero animated movie I need 3 things - great action and great story line, great drawing.  This did the trick.  I really liked the way the characters were drawn. I loved the costumes and all the bigger than life muscles everyone sported.  I think that's essential - we are talking SUPER HEROS here.

The crazy banter had me in stitches.  Anyone who is a diehard fan of these characters will laugh to themselves when they hear the insider jokes.  You might want to watch it more than once.  If you're not careful, you might miss something.  I did.  Hint: Check out the scientists in the lab scene with Cyborg.  You might recognize one of them by name.  I liked how they really developed Cyborg's story.  They tied in the tech that was used for the invasion perfectly with his transformation.

Why didn't it get 5 stars?  Well, I didn't like Superman's attitude.  From most other sources, Superman is supposed to be somewhat of a boy scout.  In this depiction of Superman, he was a bit edgy, hard or maybe even a little mean.  He was more like Batman then himself.  There also seemed to be some possibilities between Superman and Wonder Woman.  What the heck happened to Lois, and I thought Wonder Woman was interested in Batman.

Regardless, they made it work, and if they had a sequel I would definitely buy it (Hint, Hint).",1392940800,,1410,4.454901960784314
6072659,5,B00GD9GNEY,DC does a great job with a revamp on an old story. The only complaints I have are they made Wonder Woman seem like an idiot and superman shows very little heart. Other than this the movie was great,1392940800,,197,4.076923076923077
6072660,2,B00GD9GNEY,"Summary: The animation and fight scenes were first rate. Story was ok but a little bizarre. The dialog and voice acting were horrible.

Parental notes: Tons of killing, cyborg's transformation is graphic and not suitable for children, Wonder Woman is just a dumb sword swinging killing machine.

Other things I did not like: Shazam is just a nasty little kid, Billy should be a model boy scout to be Shazam not a sneaky, fool mouthed, thief. All the guy's are hot for Wonder Woman don't they have girls in their story lines? Batman takes way too much beating for a guy in a batsuit. Where's Hawkgirl, I love me some Hawkgirl?",1392854400,4,625,4.621621621621622
6072661,2,B00GD9GNEY,"It's called Justice League War, and there is a war, and there is a Justice League but not much felt like it.  I get this is a re-imagining of the Justice League, based on the New 52 (which I've yet to check out) but I'm not sure if it's these new personalities, dialogue, delivery, story or all four that turn me off from this feature.

Flash and Batman (for the most part) come off well and close to who they are, Superman is a bit more arrogant which gives me mixed to positive feelings, but Wonder Woman comes off as childish and gleefully violent, Cyborg is decent (?) he's not terrible, but how he came to acquire his abilities are questionable even to a 3 year old (don't touch the dangerous alien looking device that clearly is being studied, let alone hold it), Shazam comes off a like a kid but I'll let it slip since he is one.

But oh god.....what have they done to you Hal?!?!?  Simply put he comes off like a tool, a fairly shallow tool who managed to find a lantern ring, first the painful Green Lantern movie and now this....are they trying to erase you from our hearts?  And there is Darkseid very one note, has a generic intergalactic villain voice, and lacks Darkseid's nice little personality.

Personally this was my least favorite of DC's animated movies, but no one get's everything right and hopefully they can not do this again.  Flashpoint Paradox hit the note just right recently, but this is definitely a step back.  But this is all my opinion.",1392854400,3,1471,4.462686567164179

6072671,1,B00GD9GNEY,"Wow, lol, I'm speechless. The writing is SO BAD, I had to quit watching it halfway through. But I paid 5 bucks so I eventually finished it. The characters are so poorly written (except maybe Batman). In fact, most of the character's personalities do not fit at all and that makes this very hard to watch.

Green lantern is a flat out jerk and just wants to show off. Superman acts and speaks like a 4 year old. Wonder woman is written as some kind of stiff comedy relief. Shazam is a bratty kid, even as an adult superhero (who's supposed to have the wisdom of Solomon by the way). This movie spends more time developing a whiny Cyborg than it does any other character. In fact, he's the only hero that gets a backstory (a boring, cliche'd backstory).

Yes the animation is good, although the fight scenes with Darkseid & his creatures are long and drawn out. And then for some reason they have to make a big deal about saving the President. (Even though this invasion is happening all over the world!)

This felt exactly like some mindless Hollywood ""blockbuster"" than a creative or fun animated movie. What happened to you DC? You should be embarrassed by this! I'm still shaking my head just thinking about it!",1392681600,5,1213,4.529680365296803

6072674,3,B00GD9GNEY,"I understand that the Justice League is awesome. Compared to Marvel, who has mainly humans with supernatural abilities from accidents or genetic mutations of earthly origin, DC had the wherewithal to encompass the universe as a possibility for power and character origins. This was both brilliant and stupid. Before they have even made their characters understandable to the average fan, they go and change every character's storyline and expect people to jump onboard with a movie that contains literally no backstory for every character except Cyclops, who isn't really even a major Justice Leaguer. The movie is just like Man of Steel. Way too short and no story, plot, or character development, and the major issue that Wonder Woman for some reason is attacked for, property destruction, is not only not addressed, but seemingly ignored and applauded at the end of the movie. I so wish that DC would slow down and recognize that slower character development is required, much like the Marvel movies that led up to the Avengers. They may not all have been fantastic movies by themselves, but they allowed the audience to understand the lead up to the great movie that was the Avengers. The DC Universe movies are not only strange, but they seem to eliminate any opportunities for cross-character/storyline development. I mean come on, Green Lantern goes up against Paralax, who engulfs worlds, but Superman, Batman, Martian Manhunter, Wonder Woman, and Aquaman where absolutely nowhere to be found? I doubt it. What a joke of a story. Ryan Renolds was a great choice for Hal Jordan, but if they want to take advantage of the unlimited potential in the DC Universe, they need some character development, character interaction, and backstory.
Come on DC, play to your strengths and don't worry so much about your visuals, they're the only thing keeping me interested at this point.",1392681600,,1882,5.054662379421222

6072676,1,B00GD9GNEY,"Over the years DC comics/Warner Bros. have been very consistent with the quality animated films and television series they produce.  For years I enjoyed batman the animated series which in my opinion captured the essence of that character better than many other mediums ever did.  The Justice League is by far one of my favorite comic books and I like to think I have a strong understanding of all of the characters.  The green lantern (Hal Jordan) is some one who was chosen by the galaxy patrolling lantern core for his character and wisdom.  ""Justice League war"" portrays Hal Jordan as a bumbling idiot who shouts out terrible one liners.  This film got a pg-13 rating which i'm assuming they were trying to bring it to an young adult/teenage audience which is fine.  However if all they were looking to do was make an animated film with cursing and violence that does not add anything to the story then they did a good job.  Wonder woman gets called a ""whore"" at one point and steals ice cream from a street vendor by threatening him with a sword.  Batman's voice is terrible, superman is boring, the Flash was actually okay.  To bad The Flash couldn't tap into the speed force somehow, travel back in time and prevent this piece of crap from being made.",1392681600,4,1258,4.605381165919282
6072677,3,B00GD9GNEY,"It's interesting to read the perspectives of the of fans in the reviews section namely because it speaks to the various levels of people's love of this universe.  Before I get into more insights, the bottom line is, regardless of your level of fanhood for the Justice League/DC Comics, you should minimally rent this just to be able to chime in with your take on this adaptation of many beloved characters in DC Comics-verse.  Maximally, you should rent (not buy) this because it is entertaining.  OK, now let's get into this some more, shall we?

(1) The swearing.  Don't watch this with your kids because there are occasional swears -- i.e. ""whore,"" ""oh s***"" etc.  They're not plenty, but in an animated movie, they're peppered in enough to make you say, ""Whoa...""  Now, if you're an adult, I don't think the swearing is a bad thing.  Let's face it; if this was the ""real"" world, we'd be hearing much worse than this.  And I guess it's always fun to imagine, ""What if this was reality..."" because who doesn't like to think they're Superman (or Batman, or Wonder Woman, or...)?  So if you're an adult, let it go.  If you're watching with kids, shame on you!  :)  No, but, seriously, shame on you!

(2) Character depiction/assassination.  A lot of reviews here comment on WW and Superman being one-dimensional.  And I would say that all those reviews are 110% correct.  It was so disingenuous to the characters that it literally made me cringe.  I understand the temptation -- perhaps the comedy -- of making Superman act like a football jock and WW behave like an airhead cheerleader, but c'mon.  How are you going to go with that in a movie that, while offers some comedic relief via Green Lantern, is still overall very serious?  This was the biggest fail of them all and made me think of rating it much lower.  Having said that...

(3) The other characters.  The other characters were more connectable and interesting; they helped made the movie very enjoyable, therefore raising the stars on this rating.

(4) Story.  Overall story worked with me.  I'm not a deep enough fan to know all the details behind the plot lines and whether it was flawed, decent, or spot on (I imagine somewhere in the middle); however, as someone who knows ""just enough,"" I still enjoyed the take on it.  I'm especially interested in the sequel to this movie, so they did a good job on that.

Anyway, that's all I have time for right now.  Enjoy the movie and, to help shoulder the impact of Superman and WW's character, don't expect too much from those two characters.  The others were much better; I'm sure people could still find flaws in the other characters, but this is about the Justice League, so there's perhaps not much time to really delve into all the characters' stories.",1392681600,2,2767,4.6570247933884295

6072681,3,B00GD9GNEY,Good movie but some of the dialog was too cheesy. This would not normally be out of place in a super hero movie but they tried to push the limit and the movie was obviously intended for older viewers.  Felt like some of voice actors performed poorly.  Over good movie and would recommend it.,1392595200,,291,4.37037037037037

6072683,5,B00GD9GNEY,"I absolutely love this movie, from a origins fan base. It was actually something I hadn't really thought about overall. How the Justice League started...There are a few things I do want to go over though.

pros: Good start to how the Justice League started, Made since from Batman's point of view, Good Action, Nice Art Style.

cons: Didn't like the overly cocky Superman, Darkside was kind of a ""punk"", instead of a real menace to the galaxy, Flash is smarter than they have him depicted in this film.

other thoughts: While kind of cool overall...Not sure I agree with Cyborg's origin here. So not a con, or a pro for me personally.",1392595200,,634,4.592920353982301
6072684,5,B00GD9GNEY,This was a great movie! Dont let the negative reviews sway you from purchasing this film. Am sure the reason for the dislikes for the film is because its different and isn't based around the normal Justice league that we are soooooooo used too. Its different but change is a good thing and from this point on I think this is a good start! 5 stars for me.,1392595200,,354,4.220588235294118
6072685,4,B00GD9GNEY,I like it because it was funny and it is setting up for the Atlantian Throne storyline and it has a few swears in it so if you are under 13 you shouldn't watch it because it also contains lots of violence and blood!,1392595200,,215,3.909090909090909

6072687,2,B00GD9GNEY,"Epic fail DC...again. The plot was rather cliche' and rather dry. This is supposed to be when the heroes meet for the first time. I assume this is their way of introducing the ""New 52"". The voice casting was awful to be blunt. I kept expecting Batman to pull out a cigar and say ""see"" after every sentence. Wonder Woman sounds and acts like Xena warrior princess. The outfits are fine except Wonder Woman's. I honestly could have liked it if weren't for the long gloves that look too gaudy. Plus the chest design is way too small. I think she would have looked better if they had made it into more of a body suit. It is not the ""New 52"" design which I like better. (Actually I like her original ""New 52"" design where the outfit is basically the same but in silver and with pants.) I not sure who decided Wonder Woman should act like...a man. Basically all the characters are vastly different than the ones we are used to. Superman is very arrogant and unlikable. They spend most of their time posturing and strutting around ""waving their swords"". This is the worst Justice League movie ever. VERY glad I just rented it.",1392595200,5,1119,4.436893203883495

6072691,4,B00GD9GNEY,"It was amazing, original, and humorous all at the same time. For the 1st time ever it brought the birth of cyborg into the movies plot. The relationships between characters had a bit more depth than usual and created much humor. The depiction and/or comparison of their powers was almost flawless. My only issue is that it didn't make Flash seem that fast in comparison to some of his flying counterparts in terms of dodging eye beams and what not. I'm probably getting too technical though. All in all I would definitely recommend watching this.",1392595200,,546,4.757894736842105

Rented it for $5 - worth it.",1392508800,,181,4.6875
6072694,1,B00GD9GNEY,"I own all the DCU animated films and this is possibly the worst. I wouldn't call it an animated film, but rather a Saturday morning cartoon with a few bad words. The story is very basic, the voice acting is way off and the dialogue is the worst.

Darkseid is a great villain, but is treated so simplistically. The only thing that is okay about Darkseid is his presence (size) and his voice, but there is no development for his character. He says a sentence in the beginning and then just shows up at the end to blow things up. Another problem is the JL just smashes lame looking parademons over, and over and ""please make the repetitiveness stop"" over!

I don't collect comics, but I love animated films. I'm not familiar with the new 52, but if this animation is any indication, I'll pass. Shazam (Billy) is a thieving little bastard. Cyborg has daddy issues and whines about it throughout the film. We get it, enough already, you're a grown man. Green Lantern is irritatingly arrogant and Wonder Woman is a moron. I wanted to take the DVD out and snap it in two after the WW ice cream scene. Unfortunately I stuck with it and I wish I had those 80 minutes back!

I'm also not digging the exaggerated art style in the last couple films. I also thought the animation was too quickly paced and could've used some more frames. Whoever was the art director and animation studio on the animated shorts: The Spectre, Jonah Hex, Green Lantern, Catwoman and even Superman/Shazam should be doing ALL the animated movies. Those are just perfection!

Justice league Paradox and Crisis on Two Earths are far superior Justice League movies.",1392508800,10,1628,4.603448275862069

6072696,5,B00GD9GNEY,Excellent movie. Great story. I how the actual Justice League movie plays out list like this movie.  Well done DC.,1392508800,,114,4.7
6072697,5,B00GD9GNEY,I remember as a child thinking Marvel Comics had an edge over DC. As an adult I see the differences more clearly. In animated features DC is telling adult stories that even kids can relate in the true tradition of fairy tales whereas Marvel's Disneyfication process is almost complete. I love these animated features! Batman is the absolute best.,1392508800,,346,4.88135593220339
6072698,2,B00GD9GNEY,"Let's just get this out there: the animation is great. The action is top notch. (Though, I don't care for all the character designs--especially making Superman's neck so thick his head looked too small, but that's more a matter of personal taste.)

However, the story is so thin as to be nearly non-existent. The dialogue is mediocre for the most part with a few nice stand-out moments. (Shazam and Green Lantern offer some nicely lighthearted moments to this otherwise rather blood-n-gutsy feature.) For the most part, though, it's just a string of loosely strung together, very nicely animated fight sequences.

Many of the central characters are reduced to largely shallow pastiches of themselves. (Superman's a brute. Batman's wooden and one-note. Wonder Woman's a blood-lusting lunatic who goes slapstick giddy over ice cream and fangirls over Superman.) The voice work is utterly lackluster, particularly in the cases of Batman and Wonder Woman, which really shows when paired with the generally weak dialogue.

This film, sadly, is exactly what I think of when I contemplate the Nu52: lots of action and violence, plenty of flash and style, very little substance or worthy characterization. It's worth a watch as a rental, but I'd certainly not pay to own it. This film definitely does not stand up to the standards of previous DC Animated Features.",1392508800,4,1356,5.126696832579186
6072699,4,B00GD9GNEY,"If the plot wasn't so thin, this film could have been one of the best. I loved the characters and their chemistry--the animation was superb and the dialogue was well written. Unfortunately, Darkseid was lame. Compared to a villain such as the Joker or Two-Face, or Lex Luthor, he seemed shallow. The highlight of this film was the Cyborg origin story and the chemistry between Green Lantern and Batman.",1392508800,,402,4.840579710144928
6072700,3,B00GD9GNEY,"Got a chance to look at new DC comics animation movie war. For starters it may be best you have your snacks and drink right there before you begin. This story begin on a very quick pace and continue thourgh out the movie.
There is plenty of action in this movie. The fight scenes are intense and gritty and so is some of the words. But it was nice to see wonderwomen in her new outfit. Along with seeing superman in a new uniform as well.
To me it seem to be the same old foe either brianace or darkside. I guess DC feels that is a way to get the best out of superman with either one of them battling him in this movie.
It was nice that they show us how cyborg was created. Plus adding captain marvel didn't hurt. But the green lantern hal jordon from animated series was mia here. This bozo was a know it all hot headed fool. His attemp at humor with cool hand shake with the flash was a reach. But flash was on point here along with cyborg and captain marvel.
Darkside play his role rather well. Some neagatives superman act like a jerk though out this movie. Especialy after he saw wonder women constantly trying to show how strong he was i guess he was trying to impress amazon beauty.
Plus orther than closing the deal the b team with flash cyborg wonder woman captain marvel green lantern did most of the work in this movie.
Wonder Women in this movie seem more gun ho on killing and fighting. If it wasn't for new outfit and way she was drawn with curves she really wouldnt made no difference. Batman on the orther side of it sound feable and old. Give me a batman with a raspy voice but edge and angry. This is a good movie if you like good fighting scenes. It worth a look if you are justice league fan. ALC",1392422400,,1716,4.156156156156156

6072703,1,B00GD9GNEY,"This... thing... is perhaps the worst excuse for a superhero movie I've ever seen in my life. It's just painful to watch. The biggest problem is that this film is simply stuffed with the worst dialogue and voice acting I've ever seen in my life; it's simple riddled with brainless non-sequiturs, cliche one liners, contrived 'big kid' cursing, and worst of all every single character either sounds like a stupid ten year old or a self-parody of a stereotype. It's difficult to run into something that any character says that isn't absolutely cringe inducing. This is even worsened by the performances of the voice actors - they sound like dumb ten year olds too and add absolutely nothing except their best effort at making your childhood heroes sound as moronic as possible.

The plot is basically distributed into getting to know the main characters as the incredibly simple minded joke of a plot villain that basically takes a big dump on everything you knew or liked about Darkseid invades the earth. This plot is just a straight line, there is no other conflict other than ""We've gotta work together to beat this guy"". NO tension is ever expressed by anybody, they're too busy doing their code handshakes and calling each other ""bros"".

I also find it simply hilarious how DC made this film as brain-dead as it is and then made it not accessible to the only people who could actually appreciate such trash: children. The characters here just LOVE to swear, so you can't even use this for the only discernible use it might have of something to put in front of your kids.

So is there anything salvageable about this mess? Well the animation is passable I guess, it's not any better than any other DC animation you'll ever see but it manages not to be absolutely awful like everything else in the film.

Maybe if you're an infant who can't understand language you'll like the pretty colors that the characters shoot at each other. However if you happen to possess the ability to speak you shouldn't touch this awful piece of contrived cringe-inducing garbage with a 50 ft. pole.",1392422400,5,2081,4.740331491712707
6072704,4,B00GD9GNEY,"Based on the first arc of the New 52's Justice League, this was a good, if not great movie. The action sequences are great, as is the instant attraction between Superman and Wonder Woman (which makes sense). It could have used a bit more fleshing out in the story and take this hint: STAY THROUGH THE CREDITS!",1392422400,,309,4.43859649122807
6072705,5,B00GD9GNEY,"I am a die hard DC fan. Love these feature length animations. I see a lot of folks not happy with this one. I loved it. Very different. But it is almost as if DC decided to do a more Avengers take. Making JLA the least likely assemblance of heros that don't trust each other, let alone work well together.

While a divergence form traditional JLA/DC I enjoyed it. And I thought it created some great one liner comedy at times. Never seen a CYBORG origin before and I think this was a great one.

I just don't understand why every time we get a new superhero movie we need to do a new origin. After 5 season of JLA on TV. Do we really need to reinvent the wheel every time.

Keep them coming. I am going to watch.... SON OF BATMAN anyone?",1392422400,,737,4.104166666666667
6072706,3,B00GD9GNEY,"This is based on the New 52 relaunch of the Justice League. Counting the various comic books, relaunches, videos, graphic novels, and the like, I suspect we're up to over a dozen different versions of the Justice League origin, with more likely to come in the years ahead. There is one significant difference between this movie and the New 52 version, and that is that Aquaman has been replaced by Shazam (Captain Marvel).

The movie takes place fairly early in the career of all of these heroes, before they are truly recognized as heroes. A suspicious U.S. government wants to imprison and study them rather than let them have free reign. The movie opens with news about a wave of abductions by mysterious winged creatures, with speculation that it might be the new vigilante, Batman, who's at fault. Green Lantern runs into one of these abductions and foils it, but is then attacked by the creature until he's rescued by Batman. After a long chase, the creature escapes into the sewer.

The interplay between Green Lantern and Batman is amusing, as this is before either of them has met the other. Particularly amusing is the sequence where Green Lantern tries to figure out what powers Batman has: ""Wait, you're not just some guy in a bat costume, are you?! Are you freaking kidding me?!""

Batman and GL track the creature and find him planting a device, whereupon GL rushes to attack. The creature utters a cry, ""For Darkseid,"" and blows itself up. GL manages to save both of them, after which they examine the device and reach the conclusion that it's alien: ""Alien? You mean like the guy in Metropolis?""

We segue to S.T.A.R. labs, where Dr. Silas Stone is scanning an identical device, brought to him by the Flash, that had been planted in Central City. All they've been able to find is that it's emitting a signal, a signal that is also emanating from similar devices in other cities. We see Dr. Stone get a reminder about ""Victor's football game - Now,"" a reminder he ignores. At the game, a depressed Victor keeps looking in vain for his father. A young Billy Batson sneaks into the stadium and sits in the seat reserved for Vic's father, and then meets Vic after the game in the locker room.

The next stop is a trip to the White House, where a group of people have gathered to protest against Wonder Woman, who has arrived at the White House with Steve Trevor in a limousine. A confused Wonder Woman, new to man's world, is flabbergasted to learn that they are protesting her.

We return to Green Lantern and Batman, who have tracked down Superman in Metropolis. A cocky GL goes after Superman, confident that he's got the power to imprison him so that they can investigate. Alas, he is sadly mistaken. Batman gives it everything he's got but can't even cause Superman to blink. After a fight, Batman manages to stop Superman with a single word, ""Clark,"" as they finally start talking instead of fighting. ""Someone is strategically placing these boxes; we have to find out who and why before it's too late.""

Victor Stone confronts his father in the lab, as we find out that the gulf between father and son is as wide as the Grand Canyon. The device in the lab activates, nearly destroying Victor in the process. Silas and his associates take Victor into ""The Red Room,"" containing new and untried technology from multiple sources. Using this technology, they fight desperately to keep Victor alive, replacing what he's lost with cybernetic components, giving birth to Cyborg (a cruder version that we're used to in other versions we've seen).

All over the world, we finally see what the devices were: portals into another world, used for a wholesale invasion from Apokolips of armored demonic fighters, under the orders of Darkseid. The heroes, Batman, Green Lantern, Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Shazam, and a newly-minted Cyborg, do their best but they're in danger of being overwhelmed. They have one edge, though: Cyborg's new technologies allow him to tap into the signal from Apokolips, giving him vital information.

To give any more information would spoil the movie. Suffice to say that a lot happens, the threat grows, and the heroes (and the world) are overwhelmed. There is only one chance....

The personalizations don't always work for me, as Green Lantern is pretty much a brash, arrogant jerk. We know that is likely overcompensation, but it just doesn't jibe with what we know of Hal Jordan in his prior incarnations. There has always been a bit of cockiness in his personality but this was too much. Similarly, Shazam is too much the annoying kid.

The animation is very good but there are no real standout sequences, just good solid work. The voice acting is the same: very solid but no real standout performances. The action sequences are good, particularly when the heroes are clicking on all cylinders in the final fight with Darkseid. I've given this movie 3 stars but it's really a 3.5 star movie, as it's a fun mindless, popcorn romp. It's not the best that this studio has done but it's an okay adaptation of the original source material.",1392422400,,5081,4.7625
6072707,4,B00GD9GNEY,"I have never read the graphic novel in which this movie derived its material. But, it was fairly good and enjoyable. It wasn't as good as Justice League: Flashpoint Paradox, because the story was centered around multiple fights and brawls. I also didn't like the way Superman was portrayed in this film. I give it 4 out of 5 stars because the animation was great, and it was enjoyable overall.",1392422400,,393,4.628571428571429

The animation is well done and I'm glad they didn't go with that horrid Batman Brave and the Bold style animation.
The ending was really poorly done.
The new/alt design of Wonder Woman really makes me wonder if this is how they're going to make her in the live action films. Not crazy about it. I buy movies all the time but I rented it and will not buy it. I just don't see any reason to own it.",1392422400,,623,4.1570247933884295

6072714,4,B00GD9GNEY,"The movie could have been better. Green Lantern and Superman seem little out of character and acted more hateful towards others. Wonder Woman, Batman, Cyborg, and Darkseid were both awesome and perfect. The Flash could have had more screen time and Shazam was okay with some good parts here and there. Overall the movie and the story was well made and played out wonderfully.",1392336000,,375,4.875
6072715,3,B00GD9GNEY,"In 2011, DC rebooted its universe, starting almost all* of their characters over from scratch.  Comic stands saw 52 new number 1 issues, some old standards like Superman, others who had been missing for awhile like Swamp Thing, some brought in from another universe like Stormwatch.  The first story line showed the New 52 Justice League meeting each other for the first time** ""five years ago"" and teaming up to fight off an invasion from Darkseid.  This is the story told by this film.

I like the New 52 Justice League more than I should.  It's like candy, it's nice once in awhile, but you can't live off of it..  Some people will say ""refined sugar? Are you nuts?""  while others will gobble it down without a second thought.

Sometimes, the weaknesses of the film are the weaknesses of the source material&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Justice-League-Vol-1-Origin-The-New-52/dp/1401237886/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Justice League, Vol. 1: Origin (The New 52)</a>.  For example, people who aren't familiar with the DC universe won't know who Darkseid is, and after watching the film you'll hardly know anything about him.  On the other hand, since the DC universe has been rebooted, old-timers have no idea what aspects of the old universe(s) still apply.  The film does improve over the comic in one respect: in the comic the plot ""Darkseid invades, but we don't know why"" gets changed to ""Darkseid invades to take over the world.""  Ta-da?  Also, with the exception of Cyborg, we aren't given origins for anybody.

Sometimes, the weaknesses of the film go beyond weaknesses of the source material. For example, when Superman first meets Green Lantern and Batman, he jumps to the conclusion that they're working with Darkseid's parademon*** and tries to kill them.  I'm not exaggerating, in the film, he tries to kill them.  In the comic, the fight isn't so extreme.  (Yes, superheroes fight each other when they first meet&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marvel-s-The-Avengers-HD/dp/B0099RFVXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marvel's The Avengers [HD</a>], that's been standard for ages&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-Vs-The-Amazing-Spider-Man/dp/B000M771VM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman Vs. The Amazing Spider-Man</a>.)  First impressions mean a lot, so this fight scene unfortunately leaves the viewer with the impression that Superman's a jerk.

Some of the changes from the comic can be a bit silly.  Victor Stone (Cyborg) is called ""Victory"" (a nickname, I hope?) and Darkseid has gone from being about 12 feet tall to being about 30 feet tall.  And yeah, for whatever reason, they replaced Aquaman with Shazam (the hero previously known as Captain Marvel, who is now a woman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Captain-Marvel-Vol-1-In-Pursuit-of-Flight/dp/0785165495/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Captain Marvel, Vol. 1: In Pursuit of Flight</a>.)  And since we aren't given any origins, we don't have any idea why, out of all the people in the world, this ""little thief"" was chosen to be Shazam.

The animation quality is pretty good, but I'd rather be looking at Jim Lee's artwork.  There are moments when it's a little jerky, so they probably needed more cell drawings.  The voice acting isn't that bad, I'd say the weakest is Wonder Woman.

If you already know you hate the New 52, you won't like this.  If you think the Justice League ought to behave the way they do here&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Justice-League-Season-One-DC-Comics-Classic-Collection/dp/B000CSTK3S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Justice League: Season One (DC Comics Classic Collection)</a>&nbsp;or here&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Friends-Season-One-Vol-One/dp/B002S3Y1LQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Friends!: Season One, Vol. One</a>&nbsp;you won't like this.

6072722,3,B00GD9GNEY,"I'm getting more discriminating with more of these features, but I'll be fair.  First off, the overall quality of the feature is, as usual, light years ahead of anything Marvel has put out, with the exception of Planet Hulk.  The animation is excellent, the story is tight (no unforgivable holes; this is supposed to be fun, after all), and the voices all fit perfectly (thanks GOD for Andrea Romano!).  It's a great way to spend some time; I liked the characters they chose for this group, although I don't diss Aquaman like others do, so I wouldn't have minded having him here.
  I'll admit to being a little old fashioned, so I found the profanity to be excessive and distracting.  It's as if the script writers had a severely limited vocabulary, and couldn't come up with anything more clever.  Part of what makes these features so entertaining is the effort that the writers put into being dramatic without going for the cheap pop.  Anybody can swear; we see it everywhere.  But that's the problem; we see it so much, we forget that profanity is the language of the unlearned.  I hold these writers to a higher standard.  Don't get me wrong; I get that these are supposed to be edgy; I like edgy.  But it has to help the story; it has to add to the drama or comedic effect; here, it just comes off as uninspired and lazy.
  As I said, I like the characters they chose, but here again the writing fails some of them, especially Green Lantern.  He comes off like a pretentious, self-absorbed idiot.  Again, I like edgy; I don't like annoying jerk.  Worst thing to do to a supposed ""hero"" is to make him a character that your audience can't empathize with.  Before long, I was hoping they'd forget GL was supposed to be in the movie.  Not good.
  Cyborg is well done, and relatable; the Flash is surprisingly mature and engaging.  Wonder Woman...........well, try harder next time; she doesn't have to be THAT ignorant, does she?  And I definitely think they went in the right direction with Superman and Shazam (Captain Marvel).
  Like I said, overall, a good piece of work, and a welcome addition to my collection.  Just smooth out some of the rough spots for the next one, and I'll be happy to buy that one too.  YO, MARVEL!!!  Where are you?!?!?!  Send somebody over to DC to see how it's done!",1392249600,,2300,4.541463414634146
6072723,1,B00GD9GNEY,"How can I put into words what has not been said previously.  The Justice League is group of thugs.  We've humanized our super heroes to the point that they are no longer heroes, much less super.  I tried to watch this movie with an open eye acknowledging the fact that it was based off the new 52 world.  Granted I know this film might not be geared toward the actual audience the comics may or may not be geared to.  But, the breakdown has to start  somewhere.  For a world that has abandoned multi-decadal references for all heroes and villains to work off of, all characters feel off, if not off putting.  There is nothing heroic about these heroes.  It gives the sort of impression of a really badly executed high school play, or reality show.  I could sit and detail every character's new found flaws, but I'd rather save time.  I must say to the writers, who will without doubt ignore my comments as some rantings of a fanboy, or a lunatic.  But, I digress, you've created a world where the heroes no longer care for the population of the planet.  Where whatever acts of kindness that do eventual come out, has no basis and causes characters to be out of character in order to posses such regard.  All characters appear to be jockeying for some imagined status rather than saving a planet.  You've singlehandedly created a group of guileless and neanderthal presentation of heroes.  You actually feel happy for the humans who turn into para demons, because when the heroes try to save them.  They do so in a way that makes the humans are just in their way.  You present a world without hope and without compassion, something that made the original superheroes tick..  Simply put it seems you have a major lack of care in these heroes.  Like you are writing comics to appeal to some fanciful denigrating need to abolish any acts of heroism.  And you're writing these movies and comics in such a way to teach kids and teens no one really cares.  Heroism is nothing but some person's misguided agenda based propaganda.  There is no selfless actions.  I know this sounds harsh, but it's the truth.  Some may venture to say I've gone overboard. I've been a long time fan of DC comics and of most of it's heroes.  The acts of Superman is what propelled me into my chosen profession.  I don't see the next generation saying the same.  I know it hurts to say this, but try rebooting again, and this time get it right.  Before you push away the fan based that you have accumulated over the years.",1392249600,5,2493,4.502232142857143

6072725,3,B00GD9GNEY,"1. The story was mundane: heroes unite to fight alien invasion. This is almost cliche, and requires superior execution to pull off. This movie did not.

2. The writing was hit-and-miss; dialogue was shallow. Several of the characters were stunted and adolescent (Shazam is excused from this complaint). Not enough time was devoted to character building. If these were classic versions of these iconic characters, that would be less of an issue, but Wonder Woman was naive, Superman was cocky (rather than humble, as he is in All-Star Superman), and other characters behaved differently than they have for decades. I can handle a reboot, but their behavior was not sufficiently justified within the bounds of the story.

3. Voice acting left much to be desired. I've been displeased with Romano's choices at an increasing rate. In earlier days I would come to appreciate the actors by the end of the movie, but with more recent outings I have not been sold by selections of some of the leads. In this production, I would have preferred a more traditional voice for Superman, particularly as someone previously successful in that role was part of the cast. Batman's voice grated throughout.

I'm disappointed that I purchased rather than rented. As a fan, I like to own all of the animated features, but I'm not convinced this one was worth it.",1392249600,,1342,4.903083700440528

Again, DC disappoints with overly frenetic, excessively angular sub-par animation with the obvious off-shore/anime influence.  they can't even hang an American flag properly ( the blue field is ALWAYS upper-left,vertically or horizontally, morons.  Except in a distress situation, for which this film may qualify).  Can't you guys spend a buck for some quality?

As far as the script, it was a superhero/cop buddy/action flick amalgam, with senseless boom-boom action, and some seriously trying-to-hard-to-be-cute unfunny dialogue.  The characters were even LESS than one-dimensional  (60's Batman TV scripts had better characterization).  I kept waiting to hear Diana yell, ""Wonder Woman SMASH!"".  And Marv Wolfman and George Perez should be screaming bloody murder for the Cyborg origin reboot.  Captain Marvel?  Yelling, ""SUCK ON THIS""?  Are you kidding me?  Oh, in the extra features, the director admits that he didn't know that the character wasn't named ""Shazam"".  That speaks volumes.

I was so disappointed in Andrea Romano for her voice casting. She does so much better.  Flash and Green Lantern  sounded like 2 high-school seniors looking to ""pants"" some freshmen, not superheroes.  Speaking of high-school, I thought Superman and Wonder Woman were going to make a date for prom.  The final scene was wrong on so many levels, I almost threw up in my mouth a little bit.

The animation is nice, a few of the action scenes are pretty cool, and some of the humor is amusing, but the writing & plot leaves a lot to be desired.  The dialouge is cringe-worthy quite often, and the characters motivations are very weak. All the heroes in this movie act like 13 year olds with superpowers.  Batman and Green Lantern decide to fly off to Metropolis to randomly fight superman for basically no reason. Superman & Wonder Woman have all the chemistry and beliveability of a 3rd grade romance.  Green Lantern is totally incompetent and played as poor comic relief, and Billy Batson is a thief (while Captain Marvel\Shazam is weak to the point of being nearly useless). Wonder Woman is a stereotype and a ditz.  Darkseid is wasted, just a giant thug...they could have replaced him with Mongul and it would be about the same.  Lots of swearing too...just because its 'cool', I guess.

Superman was a blank slate of personality and the story was rushed and full of character relation scenes a child could have written better. The way Batman unmasked himself in the middle of a battle to ""relate"" to Hal was just sad and played like a scene from an 80's cartoon at best. The stylized designs of the characters were based on the New 52 for sure but, unacceptable. I can force myself to accept the New 52 but, if this is the animated offering of it they should have not bothered.

So many chances to set up the New 52 as something interesting.  This film should have been a hallmark of DC films to open the New 52 to the non comic reading fans as something they could latch onto.  Nope.

We've also seen many adaptions into other media serious, campy, faithful and gritty. I understand the need to change and evolve to bring in new younger fans to keep the franchises alive and going forward into the future. This movie was an utter betrayal of the characters and all theyve stood for, some as long as 75 yrs. Batman is cold, calculating and manipulative but was probably the least changed from his recent interpretations.

Superman then proceeds to tear an alien in HALF with his bare hands and then slaughter hundreds more, is this the interpretation we want for our kids for my son, killing is ok without finding an alternative first.

Well, I for one do not see any of this as a problem! In fact, I think this take on the ""Justice League"" makes for better story telling.

Keeping in mind that this feature is the first one based on DC's ""New 52"" storyline (unless one wishes to include ""Flashpoint Paradox,"" which I personally do not), I do not see the characters' behaviors as being any sort of a major problem. Nerve grating? You bet! -- that is, *IF* you're any of the ""over 20"" crowd who has grown up on a steady diet of archetypal ""honorable hero"" vs. ""unambiguous rogues & villiains"" who play their respective (expected) roles: whether these are characters as portrayed in comic books, professional wrestling arenas, first-person shooter video games, etc.

So even though it was somewhat ""unsettling"" to observe these great heroic figures acting all cocky and/or behaving so immaturely with little or no refinement, this set-up actually works and plays out more realistically (though admittedly it's a bit ""overdone"" at times) once we take into consideration that (in this ""new"" reality) these are in fact ""NEW"" characters with ""never before seen"" abilities who have been thrown into a society ""unprepared"" for them and often ""unreceptive"" and ""distrusting"" of them -- in other words, the people (of the ""New 52"" universe) have yet to view and embrace these ""aberrations"" as ""heroes,"" even when they do things that clearly are ""heroic"" in nature!

So it ""feels right"" that these ""unique"" individuals who are just ""starting out"" do not feel a need to behave ""stoically"" or with a mind of ""responsibility"" and ""respect"" toward the public at large or even toward one another, thus they have this air of ""self-importance"" about themselves -- or to quote it another way, ""With great Power comes great Arrogance."" These characters with their ""special abilities"" which nobody (not even the ""supers"" themselves) yet fully understands or respects are more-or-less acting on ""impulse,"" much in the same way that any one of us who found ourselves endowed with a similar ""special ability"" or ""fortuitous advantage"" which had just been suddenly thrust upon us would/might fall susceptible (think your typical newly discovered ""hot"" film/television/radio ""overnight sensations"" who rapidly expect to receive ""preferential treatment"" in all aspects of their public lives, for example). These are characters who are still trying to make sense of their world and to find a way to fit/work in and around it -- in fact, the whole time I was watching things play out with them, one though kept haunting my mind: ""These guys are just within a breath and a half of becoming the 'Crime Syndicate'!"" (see ""Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths"" to get the reference)

So watching these individuals not only coming to terms with their ""special abilities"" but also trying to ""manage"" them in ways just enough to keep themselves from crossing over that fine line into the ""dark side,"" as it were, it was refreshing to watch ""heroes"" *GROW* into their own, rather than just being ""born honorable"" or having an ""epiphany"" which makes them instantaneously ""angelic"": these are ""good"" people who recognize that what abilities they possess could easily ""corrupt"" them, but who are still working their way through these abilities trying to find their ""true calling.""

I was initially afraid that they were going to try to go the ""X-Men"" route by making the ""New 52"" characters the objects of blanket hatred by the masses (perhaps they can still go back to their archives and reintroduce ""G. Gordon Godfrey / Glorious Godfrey"" from the ""Legends"" mini-series and work that back in into the ""N52"" line, especially since they decided to introduce Darkseid so early on in the new history), but the fact that after having been objects of so much distrust, theses ""costumed vigilantes"" have actually shown themselves to be on ""our side"" and have thus not only won the respect & admiration of the masses, but the ""costumed"" warriors themselves have also come to appreciate and have more respect for what possessing those powers and abilities truly means to themselves and to others, and that these chains of events with regard to the repelled intergalactic invasion becomes the catalyst which finally begins to transform what are essentially a group of reckless kids in adult bodies (though still quite literally in Cap. Marvel's/SHAZAM's case) into the ""heroes"" we know we can expect them to become in time.",1392163200,,5013,5.071515151515151

Should have been a longer movie, the character development was interesting but needed just a bit more to connect certain camaraderie's that were just accepted as already existing, yet somewhat contrary to the plot.  Wonder Woman hitting on Superman, that was fun.  The whole Lois thing never made sense, so maybe this is how Supes and WW end up having a kid in yet another spin on the mythos.

6072751,3,B00GD9GNEY,"This has to have some of the most boring and uninspired voice casting ever. The characters are not interesting in the least (except for maybe Cyborg) and I was amazed at how poorly Wonder Woman was depicted. She was akin to an amazonian Disney Princess form the 1950s. I look forward to every DC Animated that comes out and buy each one, partly to keep them coming.

6072754,3,B00GD9GNEY,"I have seen people complaining that they switched Aquaman for Shazam and/or that the Jim Lee designs were not respected.
Frankly those are silly reasons not to like this movie.

The voices for Batman and Superman are different and that can be distracting for a few seconds, but nothing serious.

The problem is that once Darkseid arrives to Earth (read the two year old comics, this is not an spoiler) the two page splashes from the comics do not translate into an interesting script, they just keep throwing punches and while it looks kind of cool is really boring.

To be fair, the comics were this plain and dumb, after all they idea behind new52 was to bring new reader without alienating them with a lot of lore",1392076800,2,716,4.578125

themed animated features ( Doomsday, New Frontier, Gotham Knight ) has degenerated into a pathetic waste of time for all concerned.  The management at DC Comics should take better care of their intellectual properties
before allowing ""no talent hacks"" to drag them through the mire.  It is now painfully obvious how crucial Bruce Timm and Dwayne McDuffie were to the success and integrity of those early efforts.  The warmth and humanity
of these characters ( even the villains ) is nowhere to be found.  Please tell the producers at the Warners

Adapted from the first 6 issues of the New 52 Justice League, this tells the initial story of how Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Cyborg, Flash, Shazam, and Green Lantern put Darkseid through the paces as they defend Earth from invasion. Personally, the younger, less experienced heroes is one on the main appeals. The animation is awesome, story is great, and the bonus features are decent. 5 stars!",1392076800,,547,4.708333333333333

6072765,4,B00GD9GNEY,"DC Comics shook up the comic book world in 2011 by completely rebooting their entire line of comic book titles. It was a shake-up that left many fanboys and girls angry, while others just embraced the change and moved on. I was one of the folks who jumped on the train and went along for the ride.

With the monthly titles continuing to develop, DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. trudged on putting out animated movies the same way they always had. None of the modifications made to the new Universe were addressed until now. It's 2014 and the time has come for the New 52 world to bleed over into the DC animated cosmos with ""Justice League: War.""

When agents of a devastating intergalactic power named Darkseid start planting doorways to another world, a team of super heroes must reluctantly join forces. Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, the Flash, Wonder Woman, Cyborg, and Shazam come together to keep the armies of the evil Lord of Apokolips from entering our cosmos. Can the costumed champions stay united long enough to save our planet from certain doom?

Let's address a few issues quickly before moving on with the review. Aquaman is replaced by Shazam in the animated adaptation of the graphic novel ""Justice League: Origin."" By the end of ""War,"" it's evident they wanted to give the King of Atlantis a much bigger introduction. Also, if you're expecting a familiar voice cast you better forget it. Moving into the New 52 obviously means moving into new vocal territory.

""Justice League: War"" is presented in 1080p High-Definition 16x9 (1.78:1). Besides a strange haze over the picture, the image is clean and vibrant. The haze is normal for these animated movies and I've addressed it before. It must be intentional as it's always there. Being that it's based on a comic book, the colors are all vivid and tantalizing when it comes to the picture.

A 5.1 Dolby Digital DTS-HD surround sound mix is provided for ""Justice League: War."" It envelopes the home audience in all the explosions, laser shots, and dramatic dialogue and music you've come to expect from these entertaining films. You'll truly feel like you're in the middle of the battle and devastation.

""Justice League: War"" is rated PG-13 for sequences of violence and action, and some language. There's nothing out of the ordinary for super hero movies to mention here. Parents need to remember that just because it's a cartoon doesn't mean it's appropriate for everyone.

Bonus material for ""Justice League: War"" includes three featurettes entitled ""Creating Heroes: The Life and Art of Jim Lee,"" ""Deconstructing War with Jay Oliva and Jim Lee,"" and ""'Justice League: War' Act D - From Animatic to Pencil Test."" Four vintage cartoons from the DC Comics Vault are also found. A sneak preview of the next DC Universe animated movie, ""Son of Batman,"" is featured as well.

Although it's voice cast will likely take a bit of getting used to for people accustomed to the past DC television shows and movies, ""Justice League: War"" will entertain with non-stop action and quick pacing. It almost seems like it moves along too quickly at times if that's possible. The teaser during the credits definitely got me excited for the next installment, so be sure and watch until the end.",1391990400,,3249,4.8731884057971016
6072766,4,B00GD9GNEY,"The story is weak, much of the voice acting makes me cringe, and the characterization of the heroes we are love makes me shake my head, but it is still tons of fun.

The animation and action in Justice League War are truly outstanding. The movie is worth watching just to see Wonder Woman battle Darkseid's minions. Cyborg has also become a great addition to the Justice League.",1391990400,,378,4.5588235294117645
6072767,5,B00GD9GNEY,I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE IT IS ONE TO WATCH THE ACTION NEVER LET'S UP . IF YOU ARE A BIG FAN OF THE JUSTICE LEAGUE YPU WIL LOVE THIS ONE,1391990400,,141,3.5806451612903225
6072768,5,B00GD9GNEY,"This was a short movie, but it was a lot of fun. It is just like the New52 comic that just reset the whole DC universe so if you follow the comic you know how it will end. I thought it was great and it is always fantastic to see a comic come to life. Watch the credits to see a preview of what will probably be the next JL movie up.

Enjoy!",1391990400,,340,3.6575342465753424

6072770,5,B00GD9GNEY,Wish this was made into a show now that would be worth watching on tv!!!! Worth the watch so get it.,1391990400,,100,3.8095238095238093
6072771,1,B00GD9GNEY,"To start, DC recently ran a story-arc known as the ""Trinity War"", in which three Leagues face-off and several odd mashups occur as teams change. That said, this movie has nothing to do with that, which makes the title very misleading. This movie is actually based, seemingly loosely at times, off of the first seven (or so) comics released in the reboot of the Justice League books.

Moving on, I am getting tired of every film looking stylistically like the Flashpoint Paradox book. The animation team is drawing every character with box-ier and box-ier faces (in Superman's case it is to the point where he looks fat!) and everyone is so freakishly ripped beyond human capacity. I get that Superman should be buff, but Flash and Lantern? It is creepy. Really creepy. It is to the point where I assume that just donning some tights will make you gain 90lbs in muscle-mass, and on a more serious note, it makes every character look the same! Like, ""Oh hey, flash and batman are so strong that now they can punch big parademons that are giving Cyborg, Wonder Woman, and Suoerman some problems!""

Speaking of Cyborg, if his dad took off his own glasses, there would be no difference between father and son. I get we look like our parents sometimes, but this is to the point where the studio literally drew the same guy twice in a different outfit...yeah.

The Shazam/Aquaman thing, I don't get the decision behind it. If you haven't read other comments, Aquaman is not in this movie, even though he was on the team in the comic this is based-off of...Instead, we get Shazam. I love Shazam, but this movie didn't portray him well in my opinion, and I did mot understand any point to trade him for Aquaman. In fact, Shazam's funny lines and all were either taken from Flash and Lantern in the comic, or just seemed forced. They take away from the humor the outher Leaguers get to have because he makes them seem so serious!

To continue on continuity issues, several changes from page to film were made...none of them really translated well. Every change that was made, like Cyborg knowing Billy Batson, or Flash knowing Dr. Silas...it all seemed random and or forced. In the book, it made sense when everyone comes together, why bother changing the way it was written? On that, if there's one thing you SHOULD change between page and film, it is script. The lines worked on page because they needed to show emotion or a liveliness on a flat medium. In film, your characters move and this means you can show emotions without really having to spell them out in what people say. That voice casting and script, along with they way it was read...most of the scenes that might have been good or great were distracting because what you hear and see seems so different!

I don't like leaving bad reviews, this is my second...I just really think this was a miss on DC's part",1391990400,13,2862,4.614931237721022
6072772,3,B00GD9GNEY,"I enjoyed this film but I don't think it was the best DC  animated film.  It is a faithful adaptation of the book Justice League: Origin, but it lacks the depth and emotional charge of the book.  You will find many familiar scenes from the book here , but at the end of it all I did not get into this film the same way I got into the book.  In the end Justice League: War just goes through the motions of the original source.",1391990400,2,425,3.9647058823529413
6072773,4,B00GD9GNEY,Another great example of DC's animation. The story is pretty standard fair bit the costumes and dialogue for the characters is spot on.,1391990400,,135,4.913043478260869
6072774,5,B00GD9GNEY,"I've seen pretty much every DC animated movie/series and Justice League War is not the best but it is good! If you have neve read any DC comics new 52 stuff, then the movie will come off a little odd to you. The characters personalities are not exactly like the traditional Justice League personalities. The movie pretty much re tells the story of new 52 Justice League issue #1-6 of how they all came together in the new 52 DC universe. There isn't much character development with certain heroes like Flash or Superman, its almost as if your viewing the movie through Green Lantern's or Batman's point of view, but the action is great and it is fun film to watch. If you have a 5.1 surround sound, this movie doesn't dissapoint, especially the scene when Darkseid arrives on earth and let the heroes know who he is. The art and animation is top notch. For those who are critical about this movie, I don't even know what to say them, alot of them probably never have read the new 52 stuff, but this movie is a must buy. P.S. watch the after credit scene....",1391990400,,1057,4.425641025641026
6072775,5,B00GD9GNEY,Loved this movie!!  The dynamic between Batman and Green Latern is hysterical. And I love the re-telling of Cyborg's origins.  Even Shazam (not one of my favorite characters) was pretty cool in this movie.,1391990400,,205,5.0
6072776,1,B00GD9GNEY,"Let me say first that I am not the target audience.  I do not read the New 52.  I grew up in a world where heroes were those people who exhibited extraordinary power and took it upon themselves to use it in a responsible fashion.  This movie exemplified everything that is wrong with the re-imagining of these characters.  But since this is a review of the movie let me pause and give the good first:

The Good:  The action was good if a little bloody and some of the dialogue was rather witty albeit forced at times.  Voice acting I thought was solid, exceeding the writing which felt forced at times.  Animation also I thought was quite good.

The Bad:  The heroes weren't that heroic.

Wonder Woman - Shame on the writers for discarding Steve Trevor and having WW have an instant flirtatious relationship with Superman.  Power wise we are back to full strength WW and her being the warrior.  However they gave her no desire or feelings of responsibility with being the Amazon's liaison to the outside world.  She acted as if she didn't want that role.

Flash - Not much character building but I thought he was the best character.  Very solid.  He acted and behaved as I believed he should.

Captain Marvel (Shazam) - What made the Wizard Shazam choose him?  In previous incarnations of CM Billy was the mistreated boy who chose to hold on to a good and moral life treating people with respect holding to a tough moral code.  Billy, behaves as a spoiled self centered boy both in his real identity and in that of his alter ego.  They also moved CM's powers to be more lightning.  Gone is the similar power set to Superman.  In my opinion the lightning blasting CM is just weird and doesn't fit.  It's a choice and not one I would have made.  The choice of naming him Shazam is stupid.  That's what he uses to call upon his power.  When he introduced himself as Shazam I expected him to suddenly change.  A stupid rendition.

Hal Jordan - Reckless and brash he certainly behaves as a man with no fear...I found him...passable.  Although I found he seemed to be flip flopping a lot in behavior and attitude.  However one very important note...DARKSEID IS TOO BIG OF A UNIVERSAL THREAT WHO HAS CONQUERED PLANETS FOR THE GL CORE AND GUARDIANS TO NOT TO KNOW WHO HE IS.  Ok I'm done...let's move on.

Cyborg - Weird rendition...I did very much like the use of his father and their relationship.

Batman - ""Because he is Batman"".  There is a lot of take it with a grain of salt here.  Batman knows everyone's secret identity which didn't make sense given it was their first meeting.  Also Batman isn't a ""sharer"".  Batman is supposed to be that hero of a few words.  Here I found him quite chatty and willing to reveal back-story information in a way he previously would never have.

Superman - Wow...Here is a character that exemplifies what went wrong with the movie.  Superman comes across like a high school jock that knows he is more powerful and better than everyone else.  He is no one to respect or even like.  In his first meeting with the other heroes he is letting loose with Heat Vision on Batman... If one of those connected what did he think was going to happen?  That's the point though... Superman doesn't think.  He is brash, rude and behaves at worst like a bully at best as someone who believes themselves superior to normal humans.  He is a punch first ask questions later person.  In my world that isn't Superman.  The same way Azrael was never Batman this rendition in my mind will never be Superman.

All in all this movie gave us the heroes we didn't want...and at least for me not what I deserved.  I don't care about arrogant heroes.  I don't care about this group.  So DC..here is a message from me to you.  My money you will no longer have.  Until I get my heroes back this is the last time I will spend money on anything coming from these characters.

6072777,1,B00GD9GNEY,"I love the Justice League.  The previous animated films produced by WB have been really great takes on the characters, but this new 52 version just isn't the Justice League I've come to know and love over the years.  This is probably most apparent in the Wonder Woman and Superman characters who seem to be more blood thirsty and two dimensional as a result.  If you are a long time fan of the Justice League give this version a pass.

6072780,3,B00GD9GNEY,"Justice League: War seems to be a re-hash of the same story line that was covered in the Justice League/Justice League Unlimited animated series of Darkseid being the driving threat to bring together the heroes of the story.  The animation is horrible (IMHO) compared to what has been distributed in the past (Superman's head looked like a block with a face drawn on it).  The Flash and The Green Lantern are drawn thin to the point of being gaunt.  I gave the film three stars from the small, yet memorable bits of comedy added to a story of doom and gloom (Green Lantern acts more like the Flash of the old Justice League).

6072785,2,B00GD9GNEY,"I enjoyed the animation immensely.  The story was a rehash of the JL origin story via Jim Lee's perspective.  The JL fights Darkseid...again.  They fight Parademons...again.  I question some of the creative choices with some of the characters.  For instance, Wonder Woman seemed inauthentic and forced.  Also, the playtime is so short it hindered the screenplay which seemed rushed and lacked development.  I realize budgets are limited and DC does this for a profit, but if they can't tell a story well in this timeframe perhaps they should refrain from committing it to video.  Were it not for the above average animation, I would have rated this a one star video.",1391990400,2,666,4.936936936936937

They are nothing like they should be...They have modernized the heroic spirit right out of Superman/Batman/Wonder Woman/Green Lantern/Flash...and destroyed Cyborg and Captain Marvel (yes Captain Marvel...NOT Shazam).
Some people are praising this movie and giving it 5 stars. And I find that sad...that society has become so dark that they can't see what the loss of these characters, these ideals does.
Or maybe it speaks volumes as to what we have become. That this is the new norm.

6072791,4,B00GD9GNEY,"As most of the reviews have stated Justice League War is a movie heavy on action and relatively light on story. The main story line is getting the members of the Justice League together with a little side step setting up Cyborg's story. Animation wise it is everything you have come to expect from these releases. There was one time the animation didn't look good at all but to avoid giving anything away I will just say that you will know it when you see it. I am the type of viewer who takes things for what they are. I don't go into these features expecting perfection or 100% realism. You can always expect a few cheesy parts and some laughable dialogue. War is no exception. Wonder Woman's story was the weakest link in the film to me. She was rather useless and too over the top. It was cool seeing some new costumes and the voices all fit well in my opinion (unlike Crisis on Two Earths). War is good for what it is, a fun 80 minute adventure with the members of the Justice League. No more, no less. It loses a star for the narrowness of the story and the way Wonder Woman was presented. It ranks below Under the Red Hood and Flashpoint Paradox but at least on par with Doom and some of the more recent outings.

The Bad: I'm not of fan of superheroes using profanity so please take note if you intend to watch this with kids. The characterization of some heroes takes some getting used to. I didn't like how Superman and Captain/MarvelShazam came across as jerks.",1391904000,,581,4.576923076923077

I'd def recommend this to anyone who wants to watch a fun, action packed superhero movie. As a matter of fact, I think I'll watch it again right now!",1391904000,,425,3.953488372093023
6072795,4,B00GD9GNEY,"Given the elements that needed to be crammed into this film, (that is, handling each of the protagonists) the production team did a pretty good job. Some reviewers have made the claim, that the attitude of the hero characters in general is somewhat off-putting, but personally I only thought that the Green Lantern was a bit jarring. Shazam is a child after all. The reality is that Hal Jordan is not a particularly likable character in any incarnation, so I'm not sure that's inconsistent. I'm one of those ""Just let John Stewart be the Green Lantern"" types however, and I can understand why some viewers were not pleased with GL in this film. That said, the conflict between the various heroes made sense, and reconciled appropriately.

The animation style and alterations to character design were, for the most part, well done. Darkseid in particular looks quite a bit better in this film than his comic counterpart, and the nod to Metal Gear Solid designs incorporated into Batman's suit distinguish and round out his design. The action sequences are kinetically rendered and easy to comprehend as well.

The voice acting has a couple of low points, but is actually quite a bit better than the trailer made it sound. Thankfully Steve Blum's voice is digitally altered, as he simply doesn't have the gravitas to play a dark god. Michelle Monaghan as Wonder Woman is the other questionable choice, she didn't seem to find an effective voice/attitude for the type of dialogue she was presented with and the character falls flat as a result.

I realize that JLA: Origin shoehorned their options when it comes to representing Darkseid, but his character is a failure in this film, and for me, that's the greatest weakness of the feature. At his best, Darkseid is represented as a being of incomprehensible power, who could level virtually anything if he chose to, but instead plays games with strange and arbitrary rules to amuse himself. I'd argue that's why the character sometimes can read as a ""God"", rather than a more trivial villain.

Here Darkseid comes across as a raw brute, who is ultimately beaten into the ground. It's a poor handling of DC's most powerful, and one of their most influential characters and it was a letdown. Additionally, the lack of a clear main character makes the entire affair feel spastic and lacking in a plot, but no more so than most of the JL features.

There is quite a bit to appreciate here nonetheless and most fans of DCAU material will enjoy this flick. Newcomers who are just looking for an action oriented superhero feature may actually be even more pleased, since the weaknesses of the film are primarily related to some questionable choices in characterization. It's not a brilliant piece of cinema, but it handles what it sets out to do well.",1391904000,,2791,4.830543933054393
6072796,4,B00GD9GNEY,"I'm just going to write a simple, short review for this one. Disappointed at how they portrayed GL.  They made him look like the weakest of the group, by far.  Like other have said, it's hard to listen to the new voice cast. Don't get me wrong, they weren't horrible. But Conroy as Batman, Fillion as GL, and so on. They just are too much to live up to. Movie had great action, and Darksied, one of my personal favorite villains.  If you like all the other DCU Animations, this is still solid full length animated movie.",1391904000,,520,4.34020618556701
6072797,2,B00GD9GNEY,"The story follows the New 52 Justice League.  I read the comic when it first came out and found it to be entertaining.  It is more or less a reboot with the heroes meeting each other for the first time.  They band together to fight an invasion by Darkseid.  The development of the story itself was done well.  Each hero fought crime alone and did not appreciate the added value of teamwork until they were forced to when facing overwhelming odds.  However, the negatives out way the positives in this movie.  The prime example is the representation of some of the characters as immature brats, most notably Wonder Woman and Green Lantern.  Wonder Woman was especially annoying with her constant talk about being a warrior.  I've pretty much seen all the animation films of her character in the past 10 years and this is the worst by far, including the voice acting.  I also disliked the intentional incongruities of the story line to make for more dramatic effect.  Case in point, Cyborg has difficulty opening and closing boom tubes to make for a more thrilling battle with Darkseid.  Then at the end of the story, he has absolutely no problem opening them to take back human hostages.  My recommendation is to skip this movie and read the print version.  It is much better.  If you want to watch a very good Justice League movie, then go see the Flashpoint Paradox.",1391904000,,1367,4.6375

Batman was played out very well as a brilliant individual who has studied and research the others like the alien, the speedster, the human lightning bolt, and the amazon.  The voices for Shazam or Hal Jordan didn't seem to be very good.  Not having Aquaman made sense when watches the entire movie and mid-credit scene but it was a bit disappointing not to have Martian Manhunter at least have a cameo. It's always good to see Darkseid as the main villain especially when he is presented as the tough prominent villain he is supposed to be! Great movie.  Looking forward to the next one.

Shazam may have been the comic relief since Batson is just a child, but to take out Aquaman, the character that was in the original storyline that the movie is based on? That's low, Aquaman is awesome. They should have added Shazam without taking out Aquaman. And then, Darkseid. Oh my God, his voice. He actually has a voice that can bring fear anywhere he goes.

6072804,3,B00GD9GNEY,"I'll start off with the basics if you like DC comics then you'll like this movie.  That being said if you liked the Justice League comic issues that this movie is based off of be prepared to scratch your head at some of the changes they've made.  Definitely not their best work, probably treading closer to the bottom than the top on that scale.

Animation wise it's fine.  I only saw two noticeable problems.  One was a couple of uses of really crappy CGI that look out of place and very cheap.  The second and more problematic is the scale of Darkseid.  What I mean is he seems to jump between being either 4 or 40 times bigger than the heroes.  It's really weird when it happens.  I'm not complain about him being a giant that's fine, it fits his character.  The other character designs are okay.  I liked the change to Wonder Woman, her outfit now looks like an actual uniform instead of a sexy Halloween costume.  They do a fun thing with Cyborg where his body slowly changes from a rough metal blob to a sleek design by the end.  Everyone else looks like you would expect.

Story wise you can already tell one change from the cover, Aquaman is out Shazam is in.  To sum it up quickly the movie would have worked better if they had dropped Aquaman and replaced him with nothing.  Shazam is useless, his big scene is charging up Cyborgs batteries that's it.  Flash doesn't get to fight Superman which was disappointing because the scene in the comic when Superman actual hits him is priceless.  Flash just can't comprehend that anyone could move as fast as him.  Wonder Woman gets a new prolonged scene where she saves the President.  It also involves a huge continuity error.  The President somehow jumps from the White House where Wonder Woman just confirmed he was and seconds later is swarming with demons, with Wonder Woman literately standing on the street outside, to being on Air Force One.  Yet somehow Wonder Woman still hasn't met him until she saves him on the plane?  How the heck did he get out of the White House without her help?  We know the Secret Service guys are useless from the plane fight.  There also seems to be a scene missing from Batman saving superman on Apocalypse.  When Superman comes back he's wearing, and throws away, some weird armor breast plate and Batman has avoided getting killed by Hulking out Superman.  Oh and also Superman kills someone.  He's under mind control or whatever.  It seemed like a scene demanded by DC HQ to sync up the animated Superman with his live action counterpart.  The scene has no weight or meaning and is completely forgotten by the next scene.  The rest of the story is the same as the comic so I just confused as to why they changed anything when none of these changes made it any better or significantly different.

Voice acting is okay not great.  We've heard better voices for all of the characters even Darkseid who says I think a total of four lines.  The actual dialogue is more or less what is in the comic.  Basically lots of short quips and let's go get 'em guys.  Nothing memorable or deep.

To sum it up the movie suffers greatly from there being way to many characters and far too little time.  The comic suffered from this problem as well but it could get away with it because you could always buy one of the hero specific stand alone comics to go along with it.  The movie however has to stand on its own, the only crutch it has is the action sequences.  Everything else is C grade at best.

I'm sounding pretty hard in this review so to be clear.  I don't hate this movie nor am I mad that I spent money on it.  i had a straight up okay time watching it.  It just isn't anything to write home about, which is sad since this is supposed to be their kick off to doing movies based on the new 52 stuff.  I can't say that I'd really recommend anyone buy it at full price though.  If you haven't watched any of the other DC animated movies I'd recommend watching any of them over this one.",1391817600,,3973,4.395604395604396
6072805,4,B00GD9GNEY,"I was deadset on not seeing this movie since Aquaman (who was included in the original comic by Geoff Johns and Jim Lee) was removed in favor of Shazam, but for a good price I decided to watch it anyways...It was better than I thought, and I understand the creative turn in adding Shazam. I also liked the more mature themes & ideals as compared to other animated movies. However, Green Lantern's voice annoyed me, & I could not get over the removal of Aquaman (my favorite DC super hero, whom I hope gets his own animated very soon).

All-in-all I would say that this movie was okay, but does not measure up to the comic that it was based upon. I would highly recommend reading the 'Justice League: Origin' graphic novel instead.",1391817600,,730,4.488721804511278

6072807,3,B00GD9GNEY,"Honestly, its becoming more and more complicated trying to explain the premise of DC Comics New 52 universe.  In the event you follow comics, you're probably well aware of whats going on here, but for causal observes or people that don't necessarily follow comic books at all, heres the skinny:  in 2011, DC Comics decided to reboot/revamp their entire universe.  In essence, the characters that we all know and love, like Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, etc., each received a visual update and modern origin stories  establishing edgier heroes for the 21st century, not to mention creating a jumping on point for potential new readers.  To that end, DC Animation is now using those revamped stories as the basis for new direct-to-video ideas.  And, so here we have the modernized formation of the Justice League in the new animated feature, Justice League: War.

Based on the DC storyline Justice League: Origin written by Geoff Johns, War begins by introducing Green Lantern (Justin Kirk) as he chases a hooded figure through Gotham City.  Batman (Jason OMara) also quickly takes notice of the hooded creature, along with Green Lantern and so we witness the first meeting between these two unique personalities.  The two naturally clash upon meeting, but decide its in their best interest to defeat the mysterious bad guy before he is able to strategically place a bomb in the sewers.

With the ugly cloaked monster subdued, both Batman and Green Lantern are unable to identify the bombs origin and believe the super powered alien, known as Superman (Alan Tudyk), might have some answers in Metropolis.  However, Superman has an attack first, ask questions later mentality and the three duke it out  eventually coming to the conclusion they all have the same mystery to solve.

Coinciding with these events, several other characters are introduced, including The Flash (Christopher Gorham), Wonder Woman (Michelle Monaghan), a mischievous kid (Sean Astin), and a football star named Victor Stone (Sherman Moore).  While having an argument with his father, Victor feels the brunt of an explosion from one of the mysterious bombs that his father has been studying.  The bomb infects Victor to the extent that his father must save him by injecting him with untested cybernetic technology.  While all of this is happening, soldiers from a mysterious world pour in through portals and begin attacking the Earth.  Their leader is a powerful lord, calling himself Darkseid (Steven Blum).

With some many new heroes attempting to stop the terror, and each believing they can handle the threat on their own  this group must find a way to work together or suffer the dire consequences of having Darkseid plunder the planet, like he has countless times in the past.

If you purchased or viewed DCs previous animated release, The Flashpoint Paradox, then you could easily call Justice League: War a continuation/sequel to those events.  Once again, if you follow the comic book storylines, then you know that the events of Flashpoint are the prelude to the events of everything that happens in the New 52 universe.  Personally, I choose to look at War as a sequel, otherwise this new release just loses its flavor to me and could be construed as a random home video release.  So, from here on out  lets just consider The Flashpoint Paradox and War to be like a brother/sister relationship.

The plot of War is pretty self-explanatory:  the heroes go to war.  However, the original title of the story arc from the comic books is Origin, which begs the question, why did they change the title?  Well, for one  the only hero that really receives an origin story in this film is Cyborg.  Batman is already established, Green Lantern is established, and both Wonder Woman and Superman appear to be relatively new to the limelight, but they are also established.  The Flash, on the other hand, received such prominent billing in The Flashpoint Paradox that he seems like the only character thats just along for the ride.  Shazam also appears in the story, but hes far too similar to Superman to care about.

Along with the revamped universe comes a list of new voice actors.  Anytime Batman stars in an animated feature, hes always the one fans look at first  mostly because of the monumental voice work of Kevin Conroy in the role over the years.  However, Conroy is out and he gives way to newcomer Jason OMara (it probably should have been Roger Craig Smith from Batman: Arkham Origins), who does an adequate job  even though Batman is far too nice in this movie than he should be.  Apparently, we should get use to OMara since he will also voice Batman in DCs next animated film, Son of Batman.

Unfortunately, there isn't any carry over actors from The Flashpoint Paradox  not even Justin Chambers who did a superb job as Flash (this time its Christopher Gorham).  In any event, with so many characters in the film and only so much time to properly introduce them, no one voice actor is really able to shine more than the others.  Chemistry is usually a big part of these characters, and although many of them interact  this film really misses the opportunity to provide prominent scenes between the notable relationships that will inevitably evolve for Superman/Batman and Green Lantern/Flash.  However, there is a nice big tease about the current romantic (in the comic series) relationship between Superman and Wonder Woman.

Overall, Justice League: War is an extremely cluttered comic book feature.  Sure, there are plenty of enjoyable moments and the film is recommended for all comic book lovers.  At the same time, theres a surprisingly high amount of bad language, so this film is not recommended for younger kids.  Another bothersome issue is the amount of time this film devotes to the violent battle sequences  while not spending nearly enough time establishing an unwavering bond between the Justice League members.  Perhaps it would have been better to introduce only a few of the superheroes, beginning with Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, and The Flash.  Cyborg and Shazam both tied into the story nicely, but the cast seemed to balloon too quickly for allotted runtime of this film.  A few of them could have easily popped up post-battle in the sequel, which is teased during the end credits  so be sure not to miss that scene.  All in all, War is an average animated flick, but pales in comparison to the old Justice League television show.

The role reversal of Bats and Super didn't fit. Kal has always been the boy scout of the bunch and Bats the loner reluctant to be a part of a team. Yet Kal is the one who ""works alone"" and Bats was ready to jump into the league. Also Wonder Woman's hair color was completely wrong, her personality in this feature would suggest she is a super powered blonde bimbo from bay watch. She is the princes of the Amazons not some skank sorority with a rope and a sword. As far as Superman he was made out to just be ""another big dumb guy"".  I am disappointed that there was not a Green Arrow incorporated into this feature.

Fleshing out the original new origin of the Justice League from the New 52 launch, War provides quick but meaningful origins and introductions for powerful individuals who must learn to work together as a team in order to succeed. I'm not sure if this format will work outside the field of animation, but it certainly seems to be a possible template for what Snyder has in mind for the next Man of Steel movie. One issue I had with it, however (but this also ties in with the original comic book plot): Darkseid is portrayed as a hulking giant, a blunt force of nature. I've never seen a version of Darkseid in which he is portrayed as towering over all his adversaries. The appeal of Darkseid is that, despite his tremendous strength, he hides in the shadows, manipulating others like pieces on a chessboard. As such, he's often designed as short and stocky, a physical appearance that belies his true menace and power.

6072815,2,B00GD9GNEY,"For the casual moviegoer, the DC Universe Original Movie ""Justice League: War"" is simply an uneven and ultimately wasted 79 minute running time. For longtime fans of the previously titled DC Universe Animated Original Movies, it's a heartbreaker.

Skilled action and dramatic director Jay Oliva does his best with a screenplay by Heath Corson that is solid, although dialogue and characterizations could have used a second pass. Both are undermined by this being the most miss-cast film in the DCUOM history. Even legendary Voice Director Andrea Romano can't squeeze the right emotional performances out of this cast at virtually any moment, crucially the critical ones.

Returning composer Kevin Klieisch (""Superman Unbound"") delivers another 'low-budget, overtly synth sounding' score that has fans longing for the DCUOM days of the master Christopher Drake, along with past composers Kevin Manthei, Robert J. Kral, and James L. Venable. Why Frederick Wiedmann, who nailed DCUOM's previous release ""Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox"" with a sound that was both organic and fresh was NOT brought back to score this new film is a travesty.

The plot is a relatively straightforward, and at times improved, adaptation of Geoff Johns, Jim Lee and Scott William's first 6 issues of DC Comic's The New 52 title 'Justice League,' giving audiences a Joss Whedon 'Avengers' origin take on the classic 'Justice League' story. It's the first team-up for Superman, Batman, Wonder-Woman, the Green Lantern, Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg.

For the film, writer Corson swaps out Aquaman for Shazam. Believe it or not, it's a wise move.  Shazam is played by Oscar nominee, SAG winner, and LORD OF THE RINGS Trilogy star Sean Astin.

He seems to be the only one having fun and perfectly cast in his role. Christopher Gorham (TV's 'Covert Affairs') is a passable Barry Allen/The Flash, while Michele Monaghan's part as Wonder Woman is so poorly developed, you can't really fault her for playing the role as written and directed. Justin Kirk of TV's 'Modern Family' appears to be playing Hal Jordan/Green Lantern as an over-the-top arrogant 'Plastic Man Green Lantern,' but he fails to find humanity nor any humility in his performance. Ditto Alan Tudyk of TV's 'Suburgatory' and 'Arrested Development' as Superman. Rarely has the Man of Steel been annoyingly, and disturbingly, arrogant, aggressive, violent and unintelligent.

Shemar Moore does shine as Cyborg, and the subplot involving his relationship with his father is one of the best aspects of the film. Finally, there's DCUOM's new Dark Knight - Jason O'More, of TV's 'Terra Nova' and last season's 'The Good Wife.' He has his moments, but he mostly reaffirms Kevin Conroy and Bruce Greenwood's performance dominance of the role in animation from 1992 - 2014.

And this very reasonably budgeted voice cast is the key to what makes this film fail. If we don't buy the vocal part of an animated performance, not even a master like Jay Oliva delivering his trademark phenomenal visuals can sell the emotional core of the story. And the cutting of pennies in dropping seasoned composers like Christopher Drake means scores in which synth effects were intentional, but absent when orchestral strings, brass and woodwinds were meant to be heard, are now at times replaced with Kliesch's obvious Saturday morning/ 90s afterschool synth strings and obviously electronic orchestral arrangements.

Up until Bruce Timm's departure, the DCUOMs were - more often then not - sophisticated, adult fare, with HIGH caliber acting talent to match the incredible animation, music and sound effects. Since his departure, I think it's safe to say the days of hearing an Emmy and SAG winner like Bryan Cranston play a Jim Gordon; a Kevin Conroy, Bruce Greenwood or Peter Weller play Batman, or an Oscar nominee such as James Woods play a key villain like Owl Man are over.

If this is what passes for 'epic' now in the world of DC Universe Original Movies, the end of the entire line may be near.",1391817600,21,4018,5.111280487804878

War is literally 75 minutes of people just hitting each other. Over and over and over again.

6072818,5,B00GD9GNEY,"Another winner from DC Comics. I was a little worried after reading some reviewers saying it was all action and not much of a plot. I was recently burned on the awful ""Iron Man and Hulk: Heroes United"" by Marvel Comics and I was hoping I wouldn't waste my money again on this direct-to-DVD movie. Not so! This one is great. The animation was top notch (viewed on blu-ray), the sound was superb with great separation and deep bass at times when it was needed. The voices were clear. I liked all the new voice acting especially Batman's voice. I like the dialogue between The Green Lantern and Batman.
DC Comics have really cut back on production costs, I guess, so we can purchase it at a great price. (Currently $15.99 for blu-ray, DVD and digital copy). The discs designs are black and white, the disc menu is bland and there is not much of any opening credits anymore. That said, it's totally worth the price.

I like his overall character, and while I found him to be a bit of a punk, it would be interesting to see some character development while he's Billy Batson if they decide to pursue with their sequel (which would include Aquaman, make sure to watch the end credits!).

The animation was nice (DC animation is also good) and for the most part the voice acting was good (I didn't particularly like Batman's though, but I think I'm preprogramed to internally reject anything that isn't Kevin Conroy so thats my fault).  I enjoyed the action scenes and the dialogue for the most part.  This isn't a perfect movie, but it left me feeling fulfilled.

It's fun to watch.  I didn't get involved with what SHOULD be, I enjoyed it for what it IS.
It is a little more anime than usual, and I'm sure the next one will be different too.  I liked to see 'new' personas for GL and Supes.  I'm not stuck on 'this is how it should be', I enjoy change and this is a big bunch of changes.

Aquaman is really good in the new 52 universe and it was a shame they left him out of the animated Justice League. Not really sure why they felt the new to replace him with Shazam, who's a good character, but I would have preferred Aquaman.

6072830,3,B00GD9GNEY,"I'm a fan of the new superhero age and this movie is what I've been waiting for. Before renting it I read some of the other reviews and sad to say they were pretty spot on. It's an origin story of the Justice League and as such the viewer needs to keep in mind that it is not focused on one character, rather the organization of the justice League as a whole. This is difficult to say the least and the directors did seem to have a hard time portraying it. In short, it was all fighting. No, seriously it was with about 15 mins of actual dialogue/background speeches (Batman) cut and pasted between one non stop battle. But what it lacks in dialogue it makes up for in banter. I mean I was laughing so hard in the Green Lantern/Batman scenes! And be warned the banter is laced with swearing, but I think that makes it more... organic and grounded. I mean if I was fighting a never ending alien invasion some pretty colorful words would be coming out of my mouth too.
As for the voice acting, I thought it was great. I don't know any of the actors personally nor do I really have a preference, so no complaints. but the ""heroes"" were pretty immature (Seriously Wonder Woman!), but again who really cares when they have those incredible fight scenes and the humor right?

*spoilers*

This is supposed to be a retelling of when the JLA first form and join together.  However, it is just pain terrible and lacks any depth.  We are treated to a super cocky Green Lantern, a Batman that just takes his mask off in public and reveals his identity to Green Lantern, where he aptly replies ""whose Bruce Wayne?"", a Superman that punches everything through buildings and sounds like a teenager when he first meets Batman while fighting him and says ""so..what can you do?""  ugh!  Oh, and Wonder Woman eating Ice Cream while swinging a sword around at civilians.

It's kind of hard to believe these are seasoned super heroes who have never met, or heard of each other until Darkseid invades.

The only good part of this movie is the animation.  It is fluid and detailed, but the voice acting is terrible.  The best voices are Flash and Cyborg.  Wonder Woman and Superman sound so off.  There is just so much wrong with this film.  Oh, did I mention Darkseid is the villain?  It doesn't even matter because he is just a generic bad guy here who wants to take over the world.  Wow, what motivation!

6072834,2,B00GD9GNEY,"I have said for years now, since the DC Comics animated movies started with Superman: Doomsday, that these movies could be made into full theatre release features.  Overall, I like them better than the live action movies that DC does.  I enjoyed the Nolan Batman series and I liked Man of Steel as well but the DC animated movie line just got it right every time.

Then, I watched Justice League: War...What the Hell Happened?!?!?!?!

The voice acting was terrible (with the exception of Shemar Moore/Cyborg and Chris Gorham/Flash).  I will say though, I thought that Jason O'Mara as Batman wasn't awful.  It's just somehow not the same when it's not Kevin Conroy.  That being said though...actors like Jeremy Sisto, Peter Weller and Bruce Greenwood have done a good job at bringing a voice to the Dark Knight.  O'Mara just wasn't quite good enough yet to convince me he was Batman.

The story was supposed to be adapted from the Geoff Johns/Jim Lee story that introduced the Justice League to the New 52 Universe of DC.  It was a great story and great art!  As blah as I have felt about the new direction DC Comics has taken I have loved the Justice League books so far.  Plus, this story gave a great insight into the new take on these characters with their new looks, attitudes and the way they were introduced to each other.  It all worked so well.  That feeling was completely lost in this animated adaptation.

There were many specific things that made me feel that this movie was inferior to the previous DC animated releases:
1. Darkseid: He was lame and became the ridiculous generic bad guy they made him out to be in the Super Friends cartoons back in the 80s.  He even had that annoying, graveled voice similar to how he sounded back then.  Good fit for what Super Friends was, bad for this movie.
2. I may be the only person to say this butWhere the hell was Aquaman?  I enjoyed his character in the DC Comics version of this story.  In fact, he has become quite the bad ass in the New 52 universe and they toss him out for
3. Shazam!  Ok, while I respect the direction theyve taken with the new origin of this character in the comics I did not like his addition to this story nor his characterization.  Besides, if you're going to replace a central character from the original story why use Shazam?  (Who will always be named Captain Marvel to me, not sharing his name with the Wizard that gave him his powers.)  We already have Superman in the mix, why bring in Shazam?  Now Ive always liked ShaI cant do itCapt. Marvel and while I realize hes similar to Superman they are different characters.  Bottom line though, if they wanted to have a story with the new Capt. Marvel they shouldve made a movie about his new origin.
4. Could Wonder Woman have been any cornier?!  I see the direction they were trying to take but it took a wrong turn.  She sounded like she couldve been a perfect fit for the campy old Batman TV show.  (Love that show though by the way.)  Her characterization was not a fit for this story.  And did we really need the ice cream scene?
5. Superman and Green Lanterns voices did not match them at all in my opinion.  Once again, I think I know what they were attempting to do but it just didn't work.  These characters are based off their new looks and attitudes from the New 52 storyline but the voices just didn't fit that for my taste.  GL just came off as a stupid blowhard as opposed to a headstrong newbie with his ring.  And SupermanAlan Tudyk is a good actor and all but I didn't feel he was a good fit for the Man of Steel.  Superman should have a commanding yet understated voice being a Kansas boy.  Granted this was an interpretation of the new Superman who has not been in action for long and hasn't fully developed into his role as a hero but he came off way too cocky and kind of a douche.
6. Ok, Im an adult and Im not saying that my language is completely clean.  Plus, some of the DC animated movies lately have had mildly harsh language lately (as well as Lois Lane giving Brainiac the finger in Superman: Unbound) but this movie took it a bit too far I think.  Sure they may have been trying to match the gritty nature that the New 52 is taking in the comics but this just seemed forced.  Hey, its the New 52 style so we should probably have people cursing a lot.
7. This may be nit-picky butWhen the President asks what their teams name is at the end of the movie, ShaCaptain Marvel says The Super Seven!  Im sorry, not only did you have him replace Aquaman, now were giving him lines from characters that are ACTUALLY STILL IN THE STORY?!  Flash said that when asked in the comic story.

Overall, this movie was sub-par from the movies released previously from DC.  I hope that they don't feel that the continuation of their animated films has to stay along this line because there are many great stories from before the New 52 that could still be adapted to the small screen.

6072835,2,B00GD9GNEY,"Spoilers ahead.

Well, I just rented this from Amazon Instant Video and I was disappointed with the film.

Sure, the animation is great, but if you're going to base a film off a comic storyline you might want to be faithful to the material. Initially trading Aquaman for Captain Marvel didn't phase me, but as soon as he said ""Shazam"" and didn't change back into Billy Batson it lost all credibility whatsoever.

Also, they tried to have kid friendly moments but overall this is not a kid friendly film. Superman kills, and even the killings of Parademons can't be justified because each one was a kidnapped victim of Darkseid's that there may have been a way to cure.

Of all the direct to video films DC has done this was the worst. It is entertaining but even a fan with little knowledge about the characters would be appalled by the lack of faithfulness to their representations, even for the New 52 versions.",1391644800,3,913,4.617283950617284

6072838,3,B00GD9GNEY,"I'm a longtime Justice League Fan and DC, fan.  This movie is a culmination of the problems I see with DC. Here they took a recent ""52"" reboot graphic novel and animated it.  All the rebooted stories, redesign of costumes mostly by artist Jim Lee are presented here without any consideration of viewers with no knowledge of the source material.  And even for those of us familiar with the changes, the animation version of this particular graphic novel sucks.

1. Illustration.  Did these guys do any modeling, turnarounds? ...as the faces are drawn poorly, with Superman's face seeming to change with every scene.

2. Characters. The characters don't seem to maintain a consistent personality throughout the movie. For example, Shazam is a cocky little kid (like his 52 version) yet is a shy person when he is the superhero. Superman is a jerk throughout, Diana's personality is obnoxious. There seems to be no difference between the Flash and Green Lantern, and the only reason we know the Flash is Barry is solely by the blond hair and CSI on his shirt, otherwise he is a poor amalgam of the two characters.

3. Voices. I've always admired Romano's choice of voice actors, but she has really disappointed me in this movie. She always says that she goes out of her way to find voices that are unique, that resonated, which is needed when depicting superheroes. In this movie everyone sounds ""normal.

4. Battle Scenes. They were interminable.  Reminded me of Transformer movies...where half the movie is just one long battle...boring!!!  Spend your time watching the Justice League Series....don't waste time with this one.",1391558400,8,1625,4.9411764705882355

The story wasn't as great as Flashpoint Paradox, but it was still a good animated film that is worth watching.
My only major gripe is the characterization of Wonder Woman.  She is a one dimensional warrior out of her element who seems like she is only looking for a fight. Superman also seems quite stiff, but not as much as Wonder Woman. Originally Diana was one of the wisest of the Amazons in addition to being a great warrior.  The new 52 characterization has really dumbed her down and made her all brawn with mediocre intellect.  I'm surprised women aren't deeply offended by the new direction DC has taken her.  And I still immensely dislike the new lackluster & no longer patriotic costume.
I thought all the other super hero portrayals were acceptable and the voice overs were very well done.  I especially enjoyed the banter between the characters.  Green Lantern/ Hal Jordan was a riot. LOL!

Darkseid was more a savage brute and hulk than a calculating conqueror.  Even my kids found it to be somewhat tiresome in it's duration without variance.",1391558400,,445,5.041095890410959
6072842,4,B00GD9GNEY,"Justice League: War is yet another great animated film from DC Comics and Warner Brothers. Their last outing was Justice League The Flashpoint Paradox, and while this film fails to be as good as Paradox, the film still holds its own as a great film. The new voice actors for the film do a fantastic job. While at times they do slip out of character. This rarely happens though. The story is strong with amazing even over the top action. The action at times can drown out any story development, but it doesn't hurt the film that much. The film itself I would give a 8/10

The extras don't really help this combo pack out at all. We get 4 featurettes on this set. In total it runs at about 90 minutes. We also get ""4 Vintage Cartoons from the DC Vault"". This is just filler to make the set look better. It doesn't help it though. The behind the scene featurettes while are very interest don't provide the added extra material needed to make this set perfect. Missing is an audio commentary. Which would have been amazing.  Included in the featurettes I mentioned above is ""Son of Batman"". This is a looking into the next DC animated film. This is a short 10 minute piece, but its nice to see what the people over at DC are up to next.

6072847,3,B00GD9GNEY,"It is an attempt and a risk at that I will grant you. Personally, I think converting such a recent comic (2 years old) into an animated film is pushing it. It's old enough to no longer be on the shelves but still fresh enough to not be compared to all the great must-have comics.

The story here feels a bit cluttered because it is an origin piece, telling the origins of Cyborg, while giving some minor background on Batman, Wonder Woman and others. It is an interesting approach to say yes the JL had an origin but there weren't exactly friends at first, or even a team. This was just a coincidental event where all were needed. Unfortunately, it brings no character development. They hint at Superman & Wonder Woman's relationship. Flash and Green Lantern seem to know each other, how we do not know. Batman and Green Lantern don't get along very well and this may not be exactly interesting it is entertaining to seem them banter. This gives into another problem - not enough screen-time for a total of 7 heroes. On top of all of this is an invasion from Darkseid and Apokolips.
Here is where the story gets weak. What is the plan? To terraform Earth and turn the populace into Para-demons. A bit too simple. It feels like a nice kind of silver-age throw-back in its simplistic nature. Yet, it gives no justice to Darkseid, who comes off a evil, brutish, dictator. What of the Anti-Life Equation? Who is Darkseid, what is Apokolips? Yes, we know these things already but this is a new universe, a new origin, with new takes on old characters. Of course, it the origins of JL not Darkseid. However, Darkseid ends up more like a plot device than an actual character.
The animation is of course your standard DCUA greatness. Some of the tweaks are good, like Wonder Woman's costume which is nothing like this in the comics. Flash is missing those obnoxious yellow lines, thank goodness. The Para-Demons looked great and seeing Darkseid that size was great. The evolution of Cyborg's design was a neat idea on Olivia's part. Yet, Superman looked a bit off and his S was quite small. The CG for the Para-Demons when they are being boomed away looked a bit silly. Plus, there was the way they were spiraling. It just looked like a silly, cheap job.
Then there are the voices. Yes, the legendary voices like Kevin Conroy and Tim Daly are not here. It is a brand new cast, keep in mind this is a new universe that will begin a shared continuity. Are the actors bad? Not per say, but they leave no impact. Is that to say O'Mara doesn't sound like Batman, no. However, I think we have been spoiled by the other actors so it is hard to shake these new actors. I personally, only wish Michael Ironside could return for Darkseid. This voice is much better than the a-typical, deep black man evil voice cliche' of the Superman/Batman movie. This voice here instead is deep and almost robotic. Don't be fooled by the trailer. But then again, it feels a bit over-produced.
Overall, the film is less story and more action. Don't get me wrong the action is great. The final battle is great but a bit lengthy as Darkseid just won't go down. Meanwhile, Wonder Woman is quite the little jingoist with that sword of hers. Admitting, the Shazam for Aquaman replacement is odd. Admittingly, I love Shazam and care little for Aquaman. In all honesty, I do not think the cgange served much here. OK, so Batson and Cyborg become friends. Cool, but again what purpose? In the comics, Aquaman shows up and says I should be in charge; Batman's response - ""pft"". They could have dug into that and use it here for the movie. There is a post-credit scene hinting at something later for Aquaman. This is the one case I would say the comic is better, since you read the comic and digest everything at your own pace.
The package contains some decent special features. A behind the scenes look at Batman & Son, a documentary on Jim Lee, the ""pencil test"" of the last act with director Jay Olivia and 4 episodes (One from Justice League: Unlimited, one from Batman: Brave and The Bold, and then 2 episodes from Young Justice.) The biggest bummer is sub-par commentary. Director Jay Olivia and Jim Lee sit down and discuss only a few scenes. I assume they ran out of time and Jim Lee's busy schedule. It's especially a shame Geoff Johns showed up nowhere here.

I would recommend this as the special features are decent, animation is good and the action is great! But only for the right price, I would not pay full-price for it.",1391558400,,4493,4.525215252152521

The only somewhat engaging character development has to do with Vic(tory) Stone, his estranged father and Billy Batson, but even that felt rushed because of the go-go pace of the story.

With all that said, I enjoy seeing these heroes together, even if it isn't how they were back on Super Friends when I was a kid.",1391558400,,585,4.792079207920792
6072849,3,B00GD9GNEY,"Disappointing dialogue, flat characters (Superman is a thug, Wonder Woman is a temperamental child, Green Lantern and Flash were worlds ahead in terms of charisma, etc).  I'm not sure if this is a flaw of the source material but the characterization seemed off.  Darkseid came off as a simple thug rather than a master manipulator show in other media.  It could have been filled by any other intergalactic conqueror (Starro, Mongul).  No glimmer of intelligence at all, a real disappointment.

Voice acting was OK.  If they continue with the roles, it will get better.  I'm pretty lenient on voice acting for the most part as I've been spoiled by the great run of Justice League and the voice team from that media.

Animation was well done in my opinion.

Compared to previous DCU dvds, this one was very disappointing.  DCU had really set themselves apart from Marvel on the animated movies.  This one didn't live up to those standards.

1.  The storyline was rushed.  Since this was the first dvd of the New 52, they should have spent more time in character development.
2.  The voice talent wasn't as good as it had been on the previous movies.
3.  The artwork could have been better.  Seeing the new costumes was cool.

I will probably give DCU a few more tries to get it right, especially with Son of Batman coming up, but I am disappointed.",1391558400,,723,4.442748091603053
6072851,5,B00GD9GNEY,"This movie was awesome!  Okay so maybe the language got a little rough in some parts and it didn't exactly follow the graphic novel (Shazam's presence was a major deviant) but, all in all, it was an awesome movie.  While not exactly designed for younger audiences it still appeals to teenagers and young adults (like myself).  But the film's redeeming quality was definitely Shazam.  He has rarely, if ever, been seen in DC movies (his major appearance being in the 20 minutes 'Shazam/Superman: The Return of Black Adam) and so for his fans this movie is definitely worth buying!  The friendship between him and Cyborg is pretty cool and it is funny to see Wonder Woman and Superman staring dreamily at each other in the middle of a battle.  Green Lantern and Batman definitely don't get along but Flash is there to provide a calming influence and his previous friendship with Green Lantern definitely helps.
The first half of the movie mainly establishes a quick background for the characters and has them fighting off aliens while the second half concentrates on them mostly fighting Darkseid while Batman travels to his planet in order to free Superman and they spend the last ten minutes arguing with each other while receiving medals.  While it's true it probably wasn't DC's smartest move to start off the re-booting of the Justice League movies (is that what they're doing?) with one of the biggest villains ever it's still a great movie and very funny.
On the downside, if, like me, you want to watch the ending credits be forewarned, it's hard to read.  The Blu-ray version of the end credits looked like they were just scanning pieces of smudged paper and so it was very difficult to make out the words.  But on the plus side there is a scene in the middle of the credits for fans of Aquaman.",1391558400,,1802,4.695238095238095

Voice acting on Wonder Woman was mediocre, so added to the one dimensional characterization, and I am not a fan.

Even in recent Justice League TV series or Superman/ Batman Apockylpse  I don't recall Darkseid being bigger or badder than he is in this movie. he reminded me of some versions of the hulk that been done.  I barely recognized Cyborg being redsigned a bit different than his NEW 52 self or his past appearances  in both comics and animation forms.  While the trade was better in some ways like when Superman, Batman, Flash and Green Lantern studied mother both  love how the movie extended a lot of the scenes like Green Lantern and Batman first encounter and better police station bit with Barry Allen than comics.  Even the twist difference on Batman going to rescue Superman from Darkseid is different in the movie than the comic book. I see what other reviewers mean about Hal attitude. Even though he had it in New 52 comic it does feel out of character to the Hal Jordon we're use to in stuff like Green Lantern The Animated Series or Emerald Knights movie.

Many complain about Wonder Woman's voice. To me Linda Carter from 1970s live action Wonder Woman series will always be the true wonder woman but you don't see her being ask to animate Wonder Woman voice ever.

I will take off a star in the review for the profanity (though not at the level of cartoons like Family Guy and American Dad) they makes me wish for the return of the return of DC silver-age where all their super heroes were boy scouts compared to how they behave today. The characters may have grown up with the readers but perhaps they've grown up a little too much.

if you check out disk 2 documentary on the movie you will find Aquaman does make an appearance in the movie you just have to know where to look. but I don't want to spoil the Easter Egg.

over all though I think Marvel is good for TV shows like Ultimate Spider-man, Avengers Assemble and Hulk Agents of Smash while I prefer DC for movies such as this.",1391472000,,1967,4.481792717086835

Marvel should stick with movies and not do their animation... and  DC should stick to these animated movies and stay out of the movie houses. War was very good even considering it a new 52 storyline. Many of the archetypes you know about characters are very different but this is very likeable. The only fault I give this is the voice actor ( Michelle Monaghan) for Wonder Woman I really did not like The Voice direction with her. Everyone else, even though not being our main actors ( tim daley, nathan fallon, kevin conroy) the voices were either close enough or realistic enough for the character  to pull through. Though unlike the original story they cut Aquaman out altogether( but then again why not Aquaman sucks) .. The last DC movie ""flashpoint"" I give a 8.0. ""War"" ..  I give it just a bit higher for allowing me to buy into  new character roles that are otherwise very familiar to me. 8.25 says me",1391472000,,1016,4.475675675675675

Pretty much every character in this film has few reasons if any for an audience to care about what's happening. The exceptions are The Flash and Batman, and probably Cyborg - although that last character is pretty whiny and I still don't get his inclusion in these things.

As funny as it sounds, I'd recommend JLA Adventures: Trapped in Time over this film. The ""Adventures"" DVD was released directly to Target stores and is aimed to sell toys, but the characters in that film are much more approachable and the story is quite fun. And I guess when you get down to it, this DVD is meant to promote characters in comics, so it's kind of all the same thing.

6072861,5,B00GD9GNEY,"This movie is wonderful.  I think that most of the time was spent on the dialog( which is splendid), how they play off of each other, and choreographing the fight sequences, rather than plot . Most people will probably complain that the story is a bit thin, but i can completely understand. This is a origin story, so most of the focus was on establishing the relation between the characters. I really like how they make each character interesting. I like how they did batman. Although I love batman, most people i talk to think his over powered. In this, I think they established that he is still human, but he is still a attribute to the team. I liked wonder woman, they give her a very ferocious but pleasant personality. I enjoyed Superman a lot. I can tell he is a lot younger. He's much less of a boy scout, more confident and will banter with others. Green lantern was really cool. I enjoy the way his lines are said, they really convey how he feels about the situation. I would have liked to see a bit more Flash( in general, i don't think they always give him enough screen-time) but when he was there he was good. I liked cyborg and shazam, they play off each other well. I would  have liked them to develop shazam a bit more, and show more of why he was chosen for his powers.

The good:
It's the Justice League.
It's based on the art of the legendary Jim Lee.
There is a lot of action.

The bad:

There's hardly any plot at all in this movie, and the plot that's there, is thin and lame.
No character development.
Although the animation is based on the art of Jim Lee, it shies in comparison.
There might be more profanity in the 1st 5 minutes of the film, than in Nolan's whole Dark Knight Trilogy. (In my mind, profanity in cartoons is just silly. I don't care if it's an animated adult film ... it's sounds/looks goofy).
The voice actors add nothing to the film.  (Warner Bros should continue to use the voice actors that loyal fans love ... i.e. Kevin Conroy, Tim Daly & Susan Eisenberg).

I'd say rent this one.

DC comics are terrible and their movies even worse.  The one place I could count on for decent, and sometimes great, stories about the characters I recognized was their animated films.  And now that's been ruined.  More appropriately, it's been new-52'd.

I could get past the bad costume designs and the uneven voice acting, even though most of the male characters sounded practically interchangeable.  I can't get past what's been done to the characters.

These aren't superheroes, they're just people with super powers.  Such a desperate attempt to give these characters ""personality"" has rendered them inane and unlikable.  They're all either jerks or idiots or doofuses.  Billy Batson is a liar, a thief, and a sullen little brat; so why exactly was he considered worthy of having the power of Shazam?  Hal Jordan is hot headed and incompetent, but the Guardians considered him worthy of the ring?  And so on.

Poor Darkseid; one of DC's best villains is, increasingly, just a big dumb brute whose function is to duke it out with the heroes.

These straight to DVD movies usually slip in a few profanities to prove how ""mature"" they are, but the expletives fly fast and furious in this one.  I find this rather embarrassing, like a little kid who learned a few curse words and is trying to show off.",1391385600,15,1310,4.811659192825112
6072867,1,B00GD9GNEY,"Minor moments but not plot points mentioned:
I miss the days when Superheroes were actually heroes, not just super human.
Not only are two of the ""good"" team - the ""Justice"" League - thieves (ice cream and a sweater? - the sweater bit felt like an 80's Dr Doom was disguised as Wonder Woman it was so poorly written and executed) but, as many other reviewers mention there is swearing.  Definitely not recommended for kids (gross moment with blood and animals).
I could go on, but I'd definitely check out the other reviews in the negative column.  The positive ones seem to watch with their minds turned off while the negative ones understand storytelling and acting.
Sadly this Justice League is not a group I'd want living near me, let alone that I'd want to meet.  They are jerks.
Some of it was trying to be funny, but in their weak attempts at humor they criminalized their characters.
Seriously, the ice cream moment was just awful.  And she's part of the Justice League?  Nothing ""justice"" about it.
It really is just one big battle with no plot.  The ending of Man of Steel had more plot than this entire show.
And yes, I buy ALL movies, I'm a movie addict, but I won't be buying this one after I saw it.  After Justice League Paradox (there's no way to disarm these bombs because they're from the future ... oh wait, let each hero show you a different way) I rent before I buy, and after this one I'll be waiting for good word of mouth before I even rent from DC.
This is what happens when ""good"" and ""hero"" is taken out of the Justice League and it's just a super battle instead of anything with value.  A true disappointment from what I was hoping would be a fun show.
Highly recommend Green Lantern First Flight, but not this one.  (They were genetically modified to fall apart, but there it sits as a whole being behind him...does no one think while making this stuff?)",1391385600,10,1883,4.450581395348837

The characters were just too undeveloped and I didn't really like Wonder Woman in it at all. She used a sword the entire time minus 5 minutes that she remembered she's as strong as Superman, it was really disappointing. She was more of the ditz of the group that likes the ""jock"" (Supes). And it was so ""punch you in the face"" obvious. Yeah, I hated the pairing and I just wanted to unsee it all

Flash didn't get a lot of screen time which I also didn't like. And more of a fanboy when it came to Batman.

Green Lantern was alright. You pretty much know what to expect when it comes to GL. But in this one he reminded me too much of the movie that everyone hated. So, let's not give too much credit.

Batman...well, he's batman. You'd have to be a complete idiot to mess him up. So, good job DC for keeping the character the same cause that's a no-brainer.

Cyborg I actually enjoyed. He was the gem in this if you can believe that. I like his origin story in it. Although, he might come across as a whiney child with daddy issues.

I like Captain Marvel, don't get me wrong. He's a great character. But I would have preferred Aquaman in this movie. CM was just too much of a puppy following Cy around and I just ended up wanting him to be knocked out and not show up til the end.

Superman was much darker in this one, which to me wasn't bad. I kind of like him a little darker but lets not go overboard, like they did in this movie. You'll see it and be like ""Oh, that's what she was talking about"". So, you're welcome.",1391385600,4,1655,4.1433021806853585

Flash is always loveable and a good friend. Cyborgs' storyline was heartfelt and filled with emotion and having Shazaams story blend with Cyborgs made me like Shazaam as I wasn't a Shazaam fan. His character in the story was perfectly told through the eyes of the child he really is. I really enjoyed How the team came together and how menacing Darkseid was. He was larger than life just like his agenda but was still able to be wounded by Wonder Woman in a major way.

6072901,5,B00GD9GNEY,"The 5 stars I'm giving this individual movie may be a bit high, but its worth at least 4.  Over the last few years though, DC comics as put out many great cartoon movie offerings based on their comic properties.  I like the New 52 based comics just fine, unlike many, so was hoping the first New 52 based cartoon movie would continue that great streak.  It has.

The story here itself was forgettable, but served as a functional means to (re)introduce all the heroes.  The characters are well done, though it isn't perfect.  Wonder Woman in particular is...  oddly done.  Green Lantern was annoying in the beginning but got better throughout the movie, which I imagine was intentional.  Shazam's character is annoying, but a vast improvement on any previous ones I've seen, and specifically the child side of him is 100x better than any previous kids on that side of things, its the adult hero portion of him I don't care for.

Otherwise though, a great start that leaves me looking forward to the future.  Also, a subject that will probably divide many people but....  It is SO nice to see the heroes use profanity like normal people do.  It is sprinkled throughout the movie, but never in an over the top, unnecessary way.  The language is no more than you can see on late night network television, but makes the characters feel believable to me in a way cartoon heroes are usually not allowed to be.  If I were in stressful situations fighting impossible odds, I would swear while talking, as would at least 80% of the viewers.  :)  PLEASE keep this element going forward DC.",1390953600,2,1578,4.618705035971223

Will read movie reviews going forward to see if details like this are mentioned. The picture of the movie does not speak a thousand words since it's not enlargeable and the movie is based on a comic book series.",1390867200,4,517,4.786516853932584
6072903,2,B00GD9GNEY,"It is hard for me to not like a Justice League movie but ""War"" gives me a lot of negativity to think about.

My main gripe with this movie is the sometimes atrocious and rarely enjoyable dialogue. Not as good as the other actors and actresses of the past that we are used to. Or is it just that the writers handed them terrible lines to read in ""Justice League: War""? Regardless, this gives you reason to dislike some if not all the characters.

-Superman is arrogant, drier than usual, and seems much more interested in establishing himself as the Alpha in the group rather than being a real hero. He is made to be more vulnerable against Darkseid which would be okay if they spent the time showing you how powerful Darkseid really is.

-Wonder Woman is more of a scatterbrained ditz instead of a leader of powerful women. The attraction dynamic between her and superman was more of a highschool football star and cheerleader than 2 incredibly powerful beings that struggle with their ultimate responsibility of being heroes and try to work out their personal feelings afterwards.

-Darkseid gets very little face time before he throws himself into the action. It would have been nice to see him built up a bit more in the movie to show the threat he truly was as an individual other than just showing some of his toys.

The Batman/Lantern and Flash/Lantern banter was only mildly amusing. Say what you want about Shazam and Cyborg but their struggling young people thing was actually made sense for their characters one of the interaction and development high-points.

In short, the goal of ""War"" was to show the audience an early Justice League. How they portray this is by showing you that they all have a lot of growing up to do. That doesn't really translate into why we watch these characters. The Justice League is incredibly awkward when they first team up to fight evil and they are so full of themselves that they refuse to believe they are a team. Their human characteristics show some of the least desirable traits of humans: arrogance, selfishness, insecurity, over-confidence, etc. The entire point of a hero is to portray the best of our characteristics. Not fudging them just to introduce a reboot.

The funniest thing about the awkward alliance is that Batman, the guy who skulks around on rooftops and crawls through sewers at night, is the least socially awkward of them all.",1390867200,11,2395,4.729016786570743

6072905,5,B00GD9GNEY,"Has deviations from the comics but for the better in my opinion, especially once you view the after credits scene. Wonder Woman is Thor with Boobs, Cyborg is Super Saiyan Mega Man on Steroids, My favorite Flash is Wally West but this Barry Allen was well done. Hal Jordan was always a boring character to me so they fixed that (depending on your point of view) by giving him powers that made the other human lanterns cool. Hal's personality was of a D bag so though not  a likeable character to me I enjoyed not liking him. He has the creativity of Kyle Rayner, and builds solid objects like John Stewart thus making those 2 irrelevant. Shazzam is more like Black Lightning but with super stregnth instead of just putting Black lightning in the team seeing how Shazzam is really close to Superman in powers but he was comic goodness. Overall there were far more positives then negatives in this adaptation of the new 52 Justice League comics. 5/5 for me, I watched it 3 times including bonus features right after I purchased it.  Oh yeah Batman still has the power of ""Because I'm Batman."" But it's toned down alot probably because Jim Lee is a Superman fanboy. Yeah I said it.",1390867200,3,1177,4.547169811320755

6072914,3,B00GD9GNEY,"I am a fan of the DCAU, and most of the newer stand alone DC animated films. I went into JLW knowing that they are pushing the New 52 and a reboot of sorts of the new Justice League. With that in mind, here are the good and bad points of what I consider to be the weakest DC animated film in a while.

The Good:

The Flash- He is, perhaps, the only likeable character out of the bunch. He's smart and funny and instantly someone you want to root for.

Non-stop action - This film rarely lets off the gas pedal, from the opening scene to the end, it's go go go go. That's great and all, but it also leaves one glaring problem ....

The Mediocre:

Characterization- There is so very little done to build these guys and gal into real characters.

The Batman- Talks like an automaton. I don't need Kevin Conroy, though I would prefer him, but give us something other than growling, deep voices. Batman has no personality, no dry humor, and just gets by. He's neither likeable nor annoying. He just ... is.

Darkseid- No backstory, no motives, no personality. NOTHING. Just a deep robotic voice who stands there and fights. He's strong and seemingly impenetrable at first, then just gets his butt kicked.

The Bad:

Wonder Woman- Obnoxious, annoying, grating, however you want to say it. Sometimes she comes across as a petulant teenager, other times as a vicious %^&*). But she is never someone you care about. There is nothing noble or gracious about her. She's just pure warrior woman and boring as hell.

Green Lantern- As Batman says, Green Lantern is just a douche bag. He's arrogant, cocky, and a total pussy. I could not stand him.

Superman- If you're hoping for the All-American hero, Boy Scout, etc Superman you know and love, forget about it. This is killer, hit-first-ask-questions-later, smarmy, and stupid Superman. He does nothing that makes you care about him, has no personality other than total meathead.

Shazam- Total jerk. Calls his friends ""morons."" Not even really a ""good guy."" He steals, lies, and is just a little punk.

All in all, these New 52 Justice League heroes that WB Animation has assembled are a bunch of tools. Very little to like about them, all drawn fairly similarly with that ""young justice everyone looks the same"" pen. A bland invasion plot. Why not give us something to chew on than just eye candy, WB? Why not animate some of the classic stories and take time to delve into the characters? This kind of movie is just pretty garbage. I'd rate it 2.5, and round up to a 3.",1390780800,3,2511,4.553333333333334

Finally, it shows a group of hero's with no previous connections meeting and over coming a powerful foe. Sure, I wish it would have gone into more detail. I wanted to see more on Darkseid and the hero's back story but it wasn't a awful story because of it! Sure, it was strange not hearing the familiar voices behind the hero's but, I think that was the point. All the hero's were new and different! It takes place in a world just being introduced to the meta human variation. Hero's were still hiding after doing a good deed because they were feared. I can say more but I urge you to make your own judgement. I'm very hopeful this is the beginning of much darker dc films to emerge such as blackest night!",1390780800,3,780,4.241610738255034

Plus, I believe that neither of them wouldn't have put up with such a profane laden script and the dumbing down of the characters. This is not a good way to re-introduce such iconic figures. I can understand if WB wants to move on with the voice acting. But, this kind of story and it's content will not sit well with parents so they won't buy it.

6072920,3,B00GD9GNEY,"To be fair, it's just as good as the comic...which doesn't say much.  I think the thing that annoyed me the most was just how much of a ""dumb girl"" Wonder Woman was.  First they change her costume for some unknown reason, and then they make her a ""I like ice cream and I like to swing sword at everything"" bimbo.  So sad.  It would be awesome if they did a Wonder Woman cartoon based on the Brian Azzello comics.  I did forget how bad the comic was and the supposed first ""meeting"" of Batman and Superman.  I was bored and I bought this and now I regret it.",1390780800,9,557,4.064220183486238
6072921,3,B00GD9GNEY,"For those of you who know don't know who Bruce Timm is, he was one of the pillars of bringing DC Animation into the next level of quality. Starting in 1992 he worked on Everything from Batman: The Animated Series all the way through The Dark Knight Returns part 1 and 2. DKR was his last project before stepping down as lead. As much as I thought Flashpoint was all right, I had a hard time with War. The voice acting seemed a little too artificial and the pacing seemed a little too jumbled. I know this is based off of the New 52 volume one graphic novel, but this production just seemed to lack the heart of past features. It was action packed for sure, but it lacked the Heart of Under the Red Hood or Superman VS The Elite.

I know they're doing another JLA feature next, but I'm hoping at some point James Tucker (who is an amazing man on his own) will go back to the solo hero movies. I'd like to see them even take a break from the Batman/Superman teams ups, maybe do a Flash or Green Arrow solo movie, or even the Teen Titans project that got cancelled a few years ago.

Overall, I think the feature is worth owning for some of the more absurd moments, but this doesn't even rank among the top ten for DC animation. If you're looking for some quality Bruce Timm stuff I recommend.

Green Lantern: First Flight
Batman: Under The Red Hood
Superman VS The Elite

Also, please remember this is a PG-13 feature and may not be appropriate for children under 13 years of age. As an adult I have NO problem with mature content, but I think people should be informed.",1390780800,32,1567,4.265993265993266
6072922,2,B00GD9GNEY,"Right off the bad, this movie will (and already has) received a lot of negative chatter purely due to the comic it's based off of. For those that don't know, the inspiration for this adaptation - Geoff Johns' Justice League: Origins - reset the continuity of the entirety of DC Comics. In one issue, the entire history as we know of it of Batman, Superman and every single one of DC's characters was wiped aware, replaced with an interpretation all unto it's own; partially a continuation of what we already knew of the DC Universe, and partially something all unto itself.

Obviously, this is something that is going to upset a great multitude of people. And it did. And for the sake of artistic integrity, we must ignore all of it. A story should be based upon it's own merits, all of it's various repercussions and real world implications should never really come into play. The question, and consideration, should be just how good Justice League: Origins is as a stand alone story.

Sadly, even when looking at it through that, entirely non-judgemental vein, it's all together a pretty terribly written story. Lacking in plot and stagnant in progression, the story ultimately devolves into the meeting of the various Justice League members and a brief and anti-climatic finale with one of DC's best villains - Darkseid - that ultimately wastes the potential of both Darkseid, and the Justice League themselves. To compound that, the dialogue in the story ends up being incredibly stilted, corny, and unrealistic, taking on the childish and unintentionally comedic tone of old comics from the 50s and 60s. Worst of all, the dialogue renders most of the characters in the story quite wholly unlikeable. Green Lantern is written as if he's a 13 year old boy, Wonder Woman is reduced to an angry and foolish adolescent girl, and Superman is unnecessarily violent and lacks all of the goodness and tact of his normal persona. This all boils down to a very forgettable and common place comic book, that really can be enjoyed for little more than its spectacular art by Jim Lee.

Despite that, however, I had quite a bit of hope going into Justice League: War. This isn't the first time the DC Animated team tackled a rather mediocre story and refined it into a very well written and enjoyable film. With the general outline of the story strong - the formation of the Justice League, and Darkseid attempting to take over the planet - and cast of characters that, in every other DC Animated Feature have been great, I held out hope that the filmmakers could refine and age Geoff Johns' original story into something more sophisticated, complex, and mature.

In a word, it fails to do that. While the addition of Shazam and a few stylistic choices cleans up some of the rush edges of original story, the plot remains as simplistic and downright boring as its source material. It would be apt to call this the Michael Bay version of a Justice League movie; with characterization and plotting taking a firm backseat to almost endless amounts of action and fight scenes with little purpose or sense behind them. The majority of the movie is dedicated to these kinds of bland and uninspired action.

Between those torrents of violence and mayhem is characterization and dialogue that does little to improve upon Johns' unfathomably immature and unintelligent work, turning its main characters into a group of whiny, unlikeable and arguing children, squabbling with each other for much too long when obvious resolutions and much more dire plot concerns lay just barely out of reach.

As I previously mentioned, the film does clean up some of the flaws of the original; making the movie more of a cinematic experience, showing some added emotion and character progression for Cyborg and Shazam and providing a concluding battle that is - barely - a more satisfying experience. I did enjoy the character designs and animation more than several of DC's other animated films, Jim Lee's art style is clearly evident, and the character designs in this film are head and shoulders above some of the more atypical designs showcased in movies like Superman vs. The Elite and Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox, but animation alone - at least animation of this caliber - can hardly save the film from its odious origins, just as the minor tweaks are never able to lift the film out of the sizable creative hole that Geoff Johns dug with his story.

On the bright side, if DC does decide to continue to follow the comic series, Johns' storytelling did markedly improve in subsequent arcs, and with insiders' hints at Aquaman being featured in upcoming releases, there may yet be some hope to a return to the quality and ingenuity the DC Animated filmmakers are usually able to provide.",1390694400,12,4768,4.83578431372549

6072926,3,B00GD9GNEY,"I would like to start off by saying that I was entertained by this movie which ultimately is its goal. Even some of the stuff that made me groan in disappointment made me chuckle a little.

Animated vs. Comic version: Loosely the same story just not done as well.

Animation style: DC please stop hiring Japanese to make these movies, their lame anime style is bleeding into the work. Looks like crap and the way they handled Wonder Woman made it feel like I was watching Pokemon or something worthless like that.

Characters:

Superman was done ok but as is typical in Justice League story lines, he was taken out of the fight fairly quickly in able to give the other guys something to do. Supes vs. Batman was well done though.

Wonder Woman was way over the top, new outfit wasn't bad though.

Batman, I normally don't like Bats but this one seemed like a nice balance between the modern and the old. Professional but was able to be a little funny as well.

Shazam, I liked the way they portrayed him but honestly he didn't need to be in the movie. DC is trying to push Shazam a bit these days in order to get a franchise going with him.

Flash, well done.

Green Lantern, same as in the comic books

Cyborg, meh, never liked the character anyways so I'm biased.

Darkseid was well done but I will forever miss hearing Michael Ironside do his voice.

As others have mentioned there is very little story in this movie its mainly just poor animation coupled with disaster porn and poorly edited to boot. I don't have a time stamp for you but there is a scene where the characters go through a battle and when finished start talking again and you can swear its not the full conversation, like there was a scene cut or something.",1390694400,8,1728,4.416403785488959

I have alway looked for awesome animation and so far you have to go to Japanime to get those with great storyline.  The JL and JLU series is the closest to satisfying that entertainment fix.

6072933,1,B00GD9GNEY,"The story is rushed, it's one long mostly uninterrupted fight scene with no room for character development or plot. The protagonists themselves are either unlikable or stupid and the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth. The heroes bicker and moan at each other throughout the film, while Superman acts like a high school jock bully who treats others with disdain and disrespect. He's a big stupid muscle. Wonder Woman is somehow even worse, as whatever good her character creates is undermined by her blatant immaturity and stupidity. She holds a conversation with a simple ice cream vendor who did nothing wrong while waving a sword repeatedly in her face. No one, not even from an ancient warrior culture, would do this. Hal Jordan is a jerk who acts more like Guy Gardner than himself, Captain Marvel is a snot nosed little brat and cyborg's subplot (while interesting) is ruined by a shoddy resolution that doesn't really resolve anything about his character's conflict.

Worse still is the blatant shoving of the Wonder Woman and Superman pairing down everyone's throats. The instant they see each other it is obvious they both want to make out. It is demeaning to both their characters to see Wonder Woman instantly drawn to this arrogant prideful waste of space just because he's ""super strong"" and she's ""super strong."" I wouldn't be surprised if DC demanded this be put into the film to further sell their boring and overwrought concept of pairing these two characters up in the comics.

This was the worst DC Animated film I've seen them put out and I hope the next time they adapt a New 52 story it isn't something this poorly executed and stupid. DC should be ashamed of themselves for letting someone write their characters so poorly.",1390521600,20,1757,4.833887043189368

6072936,4,B00GD9GNEY,"Justice League: War is the latest in DC Entertainment's line of animated films and technically a continuation of Justice League: Flashpoint. This is an adaptation, albeit a loose one, of the Justice League: Origin graphic novel by Geoff Johns and Jim Lee- the story that kick started DC's New 52. It stars Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Flash, Cyborg and Shazam.

This film is about the origin of the Justice League and how this band of heroes came together for the first time to battle DARKSEID. The film is pretty much nonstop action. Right from the very beginning it wastes no time getting right to it and that is both a strength and a weakness of the film. Besides the nonstop action there is not much else story but it doesn't really matter too much because the action and character interactions between the heroes is so damn entertaining.

The characters are all well cast and the voice work is very solid. I especially love Darkseid's, he has never sounded scarier than he does in this movie. As for the League themselves, seeing them all come together and how they interact with each other is incredibly entertaining. The banter between them is very well written and very witty at times (especially between Batman and GL).

Speaking of writing, the writers, thankfully, changed a lot of plot points from the original graphic novel, so even if you've read it, there are some surprises awaiting for you.

All in all, it is not one of their best ala Dark Knight Returns, Batman: Year One or Wonder Woman, but Justice League: War is a VERY entertaining and fun animated feature that you will probably want to watch over and over.

Superman looked weird in this version. But I won' convinced hardcore fan. It is watchable but does not have re-watch value. One and done.  But I can rewatch Crisis again and again.

6072940,4,B00GD9GNEY,"I'm truly having a hard time with this movie and characterizing my feelings toward it. On the one hand it's a Justice League movie and as you can tell by the username, I'm a fan; however, I'm just not as sold on it as I'd like to be.

I love the comic series and am pretty happy with the direction the New 52 has taken and even though this movie is based on the initial story-arc, I just can't bring myself to love it.

Perhaps a big part of it is the voice actors in this movie, as maybe I'm just too attached to the old cast! Let's face it, it's hard replacing the likes of Tim Daly / George Newbern (take your pick) as Superman, Michael Rosenbaum as Flash, Nathan Fillion as GL, Susan Eisenberg as Wonder Woman, and there's simply no replacing Kevin Conroy as Batman IMHO. The new cast is merely okay and I'm particularly not fond of Jason O'Mara's voice filling the role of Batman. His voice just doesn't fit Batman for me, nor does it seem like it would help to strike fear in Batman's enemies in the same manner as Conroy's.

Speaking of voice acting, I'm not sure if it is the voice of (Justin Kirk) the new GL, but I feel as if Green Lantern and Flash are having an identity crisis (no pun intended). GL seems as if he has completely taken on Flash's persona and vice versa. GL comes off a little too cocky and a bit too much of a smart guy (but replace guy with three other letters). Don't get me wrong, I expect GL to have some swagger as he did in the JL comic story arc, but in JL: War it seems to go a bit overboard for me. In the movie, GL comes off as far more obnoxious than confident and I have trouble believing it is simply the writing and not the voice actor. I can't remember feeling the same way about the story in the comic which was very similar if not identical, so I'm not entirely sure. Who knows, it could be the slightest tweak here and there to the movie script versus the comic story-arc. What I do know without a doubt is that I feel Nathan Fillion was a perfect choice for GL so any other actor, for me, is a step down! Sorry, Justin Kirk.

As for the story in JL: War, I just feel it is a tad bit weak and although it was based on the comic book series, it just doesn't seem to translate as well as I had hoped it would. There was far too little substance and for some reason, it didn't come off as well as Geoff Johns's telling of it in the New 52 Justice League series. The heroes seem a bit more unlikeable in the movie than in the comic book series, particularly Wonder Woman, who comes off in the movie as a bumbling idiot. Once again, I don't recall her being written that poorly in the comic story-arc, but I may have to go back and reread it.

In addition, another thing that I noticed about the movie that didn't seem to hit me as hard while reading this story-arc in the comic series, is the heroes lack of concern in regards to destruction and their complete disregard for public safety. They destroy parts of Metropolis without giving it a second thought, which just doesn't seem like the heroes I've grown to know and love, particularly Superman!

In regards to the animation, it was done well enough, but I'm still not one hundred percent sold on the art-style which is a little too anime for my tastes. Don't get me wrong, I love me some anime, just not in my JL movies thank you very much. That's not a deal-breaker though as both Flashpoint Paradox and Doom had a similar, if not identical style.

Furthermore, what is up with Superman in this movie? He just looks weird to me in some parts of the film. He's either drawn way too muscular or his head is too big...And his ""S"" appears to be drawn too small! He just looks odd to me at times throughout the film unlike how he's drawn in the New 52 JL series! This is certainly not Jim Lee's Superman, which I absolutely love!

Some of you may feel I'm nitpicking here, but Superman is perhaps my favorite of the group, so I'm probably slightly more critical of how he's done as opposed to the other JL members.

In summary I feel that JL: War is on the cusp of being great and with a few tweaks here and there very well might have been. Your mileage may vary, but as it stands for me, while it is good and worth owning, it just isn't on the same level with Flashpoint Paradox or Doom, in this fan's humble opinion!",1390435200,44,4313,4.180505415162455
6072941,5,B00GD9GNEY,"Great movie for fans of DC characters. The characters are true to their form. Darkseid is a bonafide super villain that alone none of the heroes could beat but only as a league do they stand a chance.
I'm a big Superman and Wonder Woman fan. Superman's personality seems more "" realistic"" for a godlike creature in that he is goodnatured but confident and detached. It is clear that he is the most powerful hero--period. What I'm most impressed with is how Wonder Woman is clearly Superman's equal in this universe -- and they both magnetically know that they are equals. She is the unexpected ""big gun"" that even Darkseid found surprisingly amusing in at least a couple of scenes. We have only seen Darkseid vs Superman in the past. This movie satisfies the curiosity about how Wonder Woman would fare against Darkseid as a DC character that is not a dismally underpowered version of herself as seen the Justice League Season 2 and beyond. Or the disastrous treatment she got in JL Doom, for  which I abhorrently refused to pay. With the unapologetic badass makeover that she got in the Flashpoint Paradox, I expected her to continue as a true powerhouse and this movie delivered! Well done DC! I will not hesitate to pay for future movies if DC continues this direction! An anticipated purchase that did not disappoint.",1390435200,3,1321,4.743478260869566
6072942,4,B00GD9GNEY,"it really is like the Avengers movie haha.

there were two main gripes I have with this film:
-the Superman vs Batman and Green Lantern fight didn't include The Flash [which added a lot of character chemistry and backstory in the source material]
-WHERE IS AQUAMAN?!?!  although, I understand why they would replace him with ""Shazam"".  Aquaman is a jerk. Adding one more jerk to the jerk squad would've been too much, so Shazam was a good choice for comic relief.  And Shazam's relationship with Cyborg was a nice touch.

For fans of dc's direct to video movies should be delighted to know that with JL War the following dc animated movies will be more connected and less stand alone movies.

I have never liked the N52, I was hoping they'd stick to their books and leave the Animated Universe alone, sadly they didn't.

So, I gave JL: War a shot, I figured that maybe it would be an improvement, but boy was that absolutely wrong!

The writing was horrible, not only did they choose to cut out Aquaman entirely, they added in curse words and quips that felt so out of place in the mouths of the characters it was just silly.

The animation was all over the place. Superman has a head the size of a block of cheese (and roughly the same shape) cyborg looks like a junk heap for the first 20 minutes he's around and then it doesn't actually get better just less dinged up. Scenes went from being animated to clearly computer generated (yes I know all cartoons are animated with computers but this was like watching the Dragonlance movie again).

The voices. Oh good grief these were so bad. Character and voice sounded so disjointed. Vic stone was supposed to be a high school ball player, even at a senior level he shouldn't sound like he's a full grown adult. Batman sounded like he was getting over a cold, Hal sounded whiny, and Wonder Woman sounded more like a teenager than an Amazonian.

Captain Marvel being in the story and introducing himself as ""Shazam"" (but not transforming) was ridiculous and unnecessary.

6072947,5,B00GD9GNEY,"(I really liked the movie.  That's my edit to make it clear to those who can't realize that from the title.  Also, there are some spoilers ahead.)

DC is pretty much the grand master when it comes to animated comicbook movies.  As of late, they've started to take a curve toward a more mature tone (upping the violence, mild sexual inuendo, foul language -- that sort of thing) and this one is no different.  There's even a small scene demonstrating a potentially dysfunctional family, when Batman is smashed against a couple windows as a toddler watches.  The way he gets blamed for it is very familiar and ugly and is the kind of sutble adult themes DC adds to their animated movies that's just the icing on the cake.

In a nutshell, following on from the alternate universe (New 52) created by the previous movie, Flashpoint: Paradox, Darkseid's Parademons have infiltrated the earth and begun planting mother boxes so that they can open more boom tubes for the rest of the army in addition to preparing the earth for terraforming.

Batman and Green Lantern:
The banter between these two has been done very well, from the first meeting and Lantern's subsequent surprise that Batman is real to the way Batman just assumes control even though he's incredibly underpowered compared to both the villains and the heroes.  I also love how Batman's detective skills are put on display as he name drops several alter egos of the Justice League members to their obvious surprise.

The Flash and Cyborg:
Unfortunately, the Flash doesn't get much to do here.  We're shown a glimpse into his life in the police department and then he's in action as the Flash in an altercation involving Cyborg.  Speaking of which, Victor Stone's story arc here is very impressive.  I've never cared too much for Cyborg.  Quite frankly, he just seemed to be a tacked on member of the Justice League.  However, here we get some meaty character development with his issues with his father, the horrific accident (which they actually show) that leads to the operation which makes him Cyborg, and the eventual father/son friction resolution.  I'm still not sold on the outfit, though.

Captain Marvel a.k.a Shazam:
Okay, this was a weird inclusion/substitution (Aquaman is missing for some reason), in my opinion.  With Shazam on the team, I felt like the JL basically had 2 Supermen and thus would better be named the Unstoppable League.  Really, the team is so incredibly overpowered in this movie it's a wonder there was even a challenge to begin with.  I'm not very familiar with Shazam other than the few times I've seen him on film, but the portrayal of the character didn't seem at all out of place or annoying.

Darkseid:
I absolutely love what they've done with Darkseid.  He's much bigger than he used to be and (YES!) he's got that scary, growling voice again as he should have.

Superman:
I'm not entirely comfortable with this version of Superman.  He doesn't feel like the authority figure that I know Superman to be.  This one seems more rough, for lack of a better word.  What I do like about him is the no-nonsense fight he has with Green Lantern and Batman.  This Batman vs. Superman fight is EXACTLY how it would go down.  Period.  It was a pleasure to finally see that.  Some will mention the lack of Kryptonite, but Lex Luthor has access to Kryptonite and I think he's actually smarter than Batman and yet he STILL can't beat Superman.

Now to the cons, because there always are (some mild spoilers):

Wonder Woman:
Sigh.  What happened?  This version of the character is easily the worst I have ever seen, which is disappointing coming off of the spectacular Wonder Woman animated movie DC released.  The entire scene with the ice cream and the little girl was so incredibly cringe worthy and ridiculous, I wanted to smack someone just for the heck of it.  Just stop, whoever you are who thought this was cute.  Just... stop.  Wonder Woman gets called a word (rhymes with bore and happens at least twice) and doesn't open up a can of whoop-you-know-what on the moron who said it is just more flame to the fire.  The incident is a sort of tongue in cheek moment (it involves cross dressing) that the producers probably thought was funny, but it's just one more nail in the coffin for the character in my opinion.  I know it's just a guy and she can't just smash his head in, but come on.  Up until this point, we've seen the men on the team do their thing with all seriousness and when we get to the only woman on the team, it's ice cream is yummy and my ""outfit makes me feel strong, too!""  Ugh.  Also, her amazonian warrior talk is way over the top.  I just couldn't take her seriously.

Darkseid:
Although Darkseid is incredibly powerful here, he gets horrifically maimed in a way that I just don't get.  I mean, if it's that easy to maim him, why is it so hard to just have Green Lantern shoot him dead?  At first, I thought it might have something to do with Wonder Woman's sword, but then the Flash does something non-powered and has no problem.  It's inconsistent.

Captain Marvel a.k.a Shazam:
Correct me if I'm wrong, but the word ""Shazam"" is the magical word used to change between Captain Marvel and Billy Bastion.  When Captain Marvel introduces himself to the team, he calls himself ""Shazam,"" but doesn't change back to Billy.  Also, is Shazam stronger than Superman?  There's an incident where Darkseid shoots Superman with his Omega Beams and knocks him out, but when Shazam is hit with it, he's up in no time.

Batman and the Flash:
There's a quick scene of Batman getting punched by Darkseid and he survives it.  This happens with the Flash as well.  Yeah, that's not happening.

Before I go, I just want to clear something up from the movie that I've seen someone complain about.  This is a big spoiler, so turn away now if you don't want to know...

When Batman rescues Superman on War World, Superman grabs his captor and strangles the life out of him.  Now, this might seem to be a new theme going on with Superman - what, with the events of Man of Steel and all - but it's actually not normal Superman.  He's been altered into a Parademon, but the process hasn't had a chance to be completed as he proceeds to try to kill Batman immediately after.

Oh, and stick around for the mid-credit scene.",1390435200,4,6308,4.613656783468104

Did the makers of this film even know the characters they were portraying? Superman kills somebody by crushing his throat. Granted, the guy was a twisted acolyte of Darkseid, but wow. Another time, Captain Marvel introduces himself as Shazam. This does not instantly change him back to Billy Batson either. Apparently the writers forgot his name is Captain Marvel and that the wizards name is Shazam and is the magic word that triggers his transformation. Captain Marvel also had lightening that surrounded him for most of the movie. Very strange. When he was in his human form as Billy Batson, he was a larcenous street tramp. Hardly the character qualities that would prompt the wizard Shazam to bestow on him the mantel of Captain Marvel.  It's like the makers of this film had no respect for the original characters. I half expected Superman to have a gay crush on Batman to just modern things up a bit. Way to crap on my childhood memories of these wonderful heroes.

6072952,3,B00GD9GNEY,"In this latest offering from DCU, here's an origin story on the birth of the Justice League.  Alien creatures are showing up all across the USA, kidnapping scores of people and leaving mysterious devices in their wake.  Green Lantern tackles one of the creatures in Gotham and meets up with an urban legend called The Batman.  Their journey takes them to Metropolis to tangle with you-know-who.  Flash already brought one of the devices to S.T.A.R. Labs and is collaborating with Dr. Silas Stone (Victor's father) to unlock it.  These devices are broadcasting a signal... somewhere, to someone... and it's only a matter of time before this someone arrives.

What's Good:
Based upon the latest Justice League Origin story by Geoff Johns, Jim Lee and Scott Williams, it's a far better tale than the classic comic featuring Starro and a good way to introduce one of the all-time comic book villains- Darkseid.  Victor's metamorphosis into Cyborg is a good change of pace, as well as being the key to the storyline.  Good voice acting cast with the likes of Sean Astin (Shazam), Shemar Moore (Cyborg), Rocky Carroll (Dr. Stone), Michelle Monaghan (Wonder Woman), Steve Blum (Darkseid),  Alan Tudyk (Superman) and Jason O'Mara (Batman).  Rounding out the cast are Ioan Gruffudd and long time fan fave George Newbern.  And ya gotta love the little references at the end during the President's speech... one you know was coming (hint, hint) and one you won't. lol  Plus in good ol' Marvel movie style, make sure you check out the teaser during the credits.

What's Bad:
Even though it's pretty much standard now, I'm still not a fan of this Korean style of animation.  Just has never worked for me; at the risk of showing my age, it's just too chintzy.  No heart to it at all- all style and no substance.  And I haven't kept up on comics lately so maybe I've missed a few things but the characterizations were pretty odd.  GL came off like Flash used to: cocky, headstrong and full of himself.  Batman was way too eager to offer up a few personal details to GL after going head to toe with each other.  Billy Batson's life as an adopted child is barely touched upon and only exists to set up a sub-plot between him and Cyborg.  And as a stock character pointed out, they're all far too eager to engage in wholescale property damage without a second thought.

What's Left:
Wonder Woman's appearances are largely relegated to some form of comic relief, but eventually get straightened out.  Everyone's initial encounters come off as juvenile regardless of being dictated by the necessity of the situation.  And the final solution on how to send Darkseid back to Apokolips was right in front of their faces all along; no reason to take an hour to get to it.  Writer Heath Corson dropped the ball on this one; again- style over substance.

Overall, Justice League: War is an ok flick.  Just one more in the line of DC anime features to whet your appetite until the next one comes along.",1390348800,11,2975,4.717054263565892
6072953,4,B00GD9GNEY,"For those who are not aware, Justice League War is based off of The wonderful new 52s Justice league origins by Geoff Johns and Jim Lee.  If you haven't read the book, then i strongly advise that you do so, seeing how the majority of my complaints stem from the Changes that were made from the book to the film. Had the changes been minuscule, i might have been tempted to give this film a perfect 5 stars.  Lets start with the bad shall we?

The first thing that annoyed me was The change of Aqua man for the mediocre Shazam.  I found this to be just down right silly. Why in the world would they scrap Aqua man for shazam? This is honestly mind boggling? If you wanted to add Shazam into the story then you could have added him all the while keeping Aqua man as well!! In the new 52s comic, Aqua man  was so awesome! There was this once panel in the book where aqua man summoned a massive Great white shark to dispose of dark sides minions, validating himself as a bad ass in front of the justice league. This was a great way to reintroduce him into the fold! That moment was lost here because he is no where to be seen in the film!!!

The second complaint was the Voice acting!!!  The fact that we didn't have Kevin conroy as BATMAN really hurt this film. Supermans voice actor is even more unforgivable than batmans.  He sounded so stiff , and robotic at times. It just didn't feel like the man of steel i was use to. Tim Daly was the best superman we have ever had so why wasn't he recast here?

The my final complaint was the pacing..There was to many jokes, to many  filler moments, and slowdowns that honestly distracted from the film. in the comic , the jokes came as quick as the action and the pacing was flawless. A perfect example of this was the wonder women scene with Ice cream. This entire scene could have been left out entirely.

Now for the good !!

The art is top notch! Very close to the wonderful art of Jim lee!!  The action in this film is intense ! the colors in blu ray pop out and are gorgeous! The fight scenes are much longer here apposed to the comic where fights were much shorter in duration!! this is always a plus for me!!

All in all i would give this movie a 4 out of 5 ! not perfect due to the unnecessary  changes but all in all it was  still a good movie!",1390348800,2,2295,4.135135135135135
6072954,5,B00GD9GNEY,I'm glad they didn't take the name Super Seven. This was a great retelling of the origin of the Justice League and Cyborg. I also liked how they added Shazam to the team. They need to make more cartoons with him in it or the live action movie they have been promising us forever. This had great battles and great characters. Also a great villain. I hope they release more Justice league cartoons soon.,1390348800,2,401,4.4324324324324325
6072955,5,B00GD9GNEY,"I'd like to preface this review by saying I have not read Justice League: Origin Volume 1, the comic which this film is based on.  In fact, I've never been able to obtain any of the comics put out by DC.  Despite this, I've always been a fan of just about any animated show that this fantastic company has put out: Batman: the Animated Series, Justice League, Green Lantern: the Animated Series, Young Justice, and many of the other DC created cartoons are some of my favorite animated shows.  I've also enjoyed many of the Animated Features DC puts out, including Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Under the Red Hood, Year One, Wonder Woman, Superman: Unboud, and others.

I've heard a few people comment that Shazam (Sorry, but you'll always be Captain Marvel to me) replaced Aquaman in this film, as well as the much larger controversy over the ""52"" Reboot.  Don't let that stop you from watching this: this is by and far the best work the Animation department of DC has put out.  In all seriousness, if this feature had been live action, it would definitively rival Marvel's Avengers.  I love that movie as well, and that's saying something.  The characterization was spot on, as was the voice acting.  The story, full of action and well sprinkled comedy, is really impressive to watch, as the chemistry between the many heroes eventually brings them together into the Justice League.

This is not, however, a movie you should show your eleven year kid.  Violence includes the main villain's eyes being gouged in, as well as some bodily transformation related horror.  Language runs the gambit of Green Lantern calling Batman a douche bag (which I have to admit is really amusing), and an exclamation of shit.  Something else that proves rather humorous but which you may wish to be leery of with kids is a man early on in the film who under the effects of the Lasso of Truth proclaims that he likes to cross dress as Wonder Woman because it makes him feel powerful.

All in all, this movie looks like it will make a great starting point for those who have never gotten deep into comics, but who still enjoy the characters very much.  Hopefully this might help to change your decision if you had thought about avoiding this film, as it really is a gem.",1390348800,3,2255,4.630653266331659
6072956,5,B00GD9GNEY,"I watched this last night and really, really enjoyed it. The animation and action are top notch. I loved the character designs as well. It's based on the NEW 52 origin story for the Justice League, with some slight modifications. The story is solid and moves at a brisk pace. The voice work is all good (if, like me, you've been watching the animated DCU since the 90's Batman show, it might take a little getting used to the new voices - but they are solid).

The only CON I can think of is that it isn't longer and I wish it was a pilot for a new ongoing series. Great stuff! Definitely worth picking up.",1390348800,3,606,4.224137931034483
6072957,5,B00GD9GNEY,"I attended the premiere tonight and I can tell you that if you liked the NEW 52 JLA, you will love this movie, absolutely love this movie. I have to admit, I was skeptical and ready to cancel my pre-order if it did not live up to my expectations, after all with misses like Gotham Knight and Superman/Shazam The Return of Black Adam to name a few, DC has had misses here and there with their animated movies. But Justice League War is THEE BEST ANIMATED SUPER HERO MOVIE OF ALL TIME! It has lots of actions, well placed comedy, TONS of action (pretty brutal and graphic - Wonder Wowan was a beast) and character interaction and development for its constricted time frame.

Yes, they switched out Aquaman for Shazam but without giving anything away, at the end of the movie you will see why they did that and how it plays an intrical role in the ...let's say franchise ;)

There was a Q&A after and they said the blu ray is loaded with behind the scene stuff including a sneak peak at Son of Batman. All in all, if you are a fan of any of these characters, like the New 52, or even just want a great animated action flick, this is a must own.

Just a side note, if you are going to watch this with any young kids, there is some strong language in it. And BUY it, totally worth it!",1390262400,6,1279,4.191056910569106
6072958,1,B00GD9GNEY,"While serving in the armed forces, often times, when were at port in San Diego, a few of my  buddies  and I would load up in a rental car and head down to Tijuana to enjoy the local festivities there for the weekend. Upon my discharge for reasons I am unable to disclose, I sought a new line of work. Like many entrepreneurs, they choose a line of work they most enjoy so as not to really feel like they are ever working. For me, it was a no brainier as I incorporated all the things that I enjoyed in Tijuana into a Midwestern one-stop roadside family fun center Lil Tijuana.
Lil Tijuana has become quite the sensation complete with street tacos, inebriated cab driver rides, beggars, pick pocketing children, music, authentic flea market (we tend to get movies on disc before they hit the theaters) donkey shows, Tijuana Bibles, dancing and guys that doing nothing all day but make cat calls to females regardless of age.
We have a small theater set up in a tent for the kids to watch the latest cartoons while their parents enjoy the various festivities. As is the case with this movie, it seems ever since Disney bought up DC Comics, Star Trek and Harry Potter, the commercials before the actual movie have literally doubled. Often times, the parents return from one or two of the local attractions, grab their kids and leave in a hurry before the kids even had a chance to start the movie.",1390262400,7,1394,4.484251968503937
6072959,5,B00GD9GNEY,"You want a JL movie? Forget Affleck and those other goofballs in the upcoming Batman/Superman disaster.  This is BY FAR the best animated movie to come out of DC yet. Now, I may be biased cause I love Darkseid, but they did a fantastic job on this one. Some minor problems like, oh I dunno, cutting Aquaman completely from the film, (* spoiler alert- this is not completely true. After watching it again, they do hint toward Aquaman during the credits.) but I am also a big SHAZAM! guy, and considering they ran a very good SHAZAM! side story during the original comic version, it made sense and was a good recovery.  Followed the New 52 storyline pretty much on point, again minus Aquaman of course. But if I had one minor complaint, (spoiler alert) I would have liked to see more of a Supes vs Darkseid battle, rather than him just cleaning up. Plus I would have liked more back story about Apokolips and Darkseid. But again I'm big on Darksied. Anywho, great job on this one, and we're all still hoping for KINGDOME COME!!!!

**- Oh, parents be warned though. This is an updated version of the Justice League. They're not as clean cut as before. There is some cussing toward the end, and pretty much non stop violence throughout. Some parts even get kind of graphic. Spoiler alert again (sorry)- For example, how Wonder Woman proposes to stop a guy who shoots lasers from his eyes. ...yeah, stab his eyes out. So be aware. It's not terribly bad, but then again I'm not watching your kids. :)",1390262400,9,1494,4.525925925925926
6072960,4,B00GD9GNEY,"Alright, I don't normally write reviews but I thought I'd jump on here and try to give as fair a review as I can because no one else who has reviewed the film, as of this writing, has actually seen it. Vudu literally JUST released it a few hours ago for early digital purchase and I decided I didn't want to wait.

Well I'm happy to report that that was a great decision because I really enjoyed the movie. But let me get the negative aspects of Justice League War out of the way first because I feel there are so few of them.

Negatives:

1. The voice acting, especially for Batman and Wonder Woman is not great. I'm very much a Tim Daly, Kevin Conroy, Susan Eisenberg fan. I think their takes on the most beloved Leaguers is iconic. I also find it odd that they cast George Newbern, who many prefer over Daly as Superman, as Steve Trevor instead. I think Andrea Romano does an incredible job with her casting and voice direction 99% of the time, but this is that 1% where it didn't quite work.

2. Some of the dialogue, like the original comic arc, is poor. I'm not as down on the New 52 as many die-hard DC fans were/are but I was never a big fan of Geoff John's and Jim Lee's first Justice League arc that this movie is based on. First, I never like leading with Darkseid because he's arguably DC's most important villain (all do respect to Joker and Lex). Second, I never felt Geoff gave Superman any credit in his writing; he basically makes the character a jerk, and it's off-putting. Arguably, in that first arc all of the Leaguers (except for Batman...of course) are total jerks for no reason. So some of the dialogue does follow the comic and is still unnecessarily combative. But thankfully, most of the dialogue choices do work in the film.

3. Related to my previous point - Superman and Wonder Woman come off as pretty two-dimensional in comparison to the other five. But again, this is a flaw originating in the source material itself, not the movie. Hal (obviously Geoff John's bread and butter), Barry, Victor, and Billy all have much more depth to them and are more interesting - this will be covered in my positives as well. I love that the lesser known characters receive a lot of attention, but it comes at too much of an expense to Superman and Wonder Woman.

Positives:

Where to begin - Despite the few flaws I really like the job that Jay Oliva has done directing this adaptation. As I said before, I never really liked Geoff's original arc, especially his take on Superman. But Justice League War is able to correct most of the major mistakes Geoff made while still following the same general structure and plot points of the comic. Let's get into some details

1. Superman. I'll lead with the big guy because he's why I read DC comics and watch their movies. While the Superman presented in Justice League War is pretty cold, detached, and calculating compared to previous incarnations, he doesn't come off as completely unlikable like Geoff wrote him in the original arc. He's not as warm as we're used to seeing but I'm okay with it because whatever he's lost in warmth and charm, he's gained in intelligence and awareness. No where is this more apparent than in the brief showdown with Batman and Green Lantern where a ""realistic"" fight actually occurs. Longtime Superman fans will love it, Bat fans probably won't.

2. Green Lantern. The entire story follows all seven heroes but Hal is the focal point. As with the comic Hal's bravado is laid on a bit thick. We all know how seemingly arrogant Hal is, but it's just cranked up to 11 in the comic. Despite that, the movie does a good job of making it work when it didn't work on the page.

3. Victor Stone/Cyborg

I've never been a big Cyborg fan. DC has been trying to push him heavily in the New 52 and with Justice League Doom two years ago. This movie is the first time I found myself really wanting to see more from the character throughout. I always thought the father/son dynamic over football felt very forced but it was handled better (not perfectly, but better) in this go around. And Cyborg's powerset is really shown off during the battle sequences, and they are quite impressive and fun to watch - finally! I now hope to see more of Cyborg in future animated movies, and maybe even the live action universe when WB gets their house in order.

4. Flash doesn't get much attention in the movie but Barry's unique personality shines through in the few scenes he's really in.

5. Shazam. Alright, I'm going to step in it because this is what most of the fuss has been about. Yes they replaced Aquaman with Captain Marvel/Shazam in the movie. Personally, I do like what Geoff has done with Aquaman in the New 52. It's probably a top-5 book in the rebooted universe. And the third arc that Geoff worked on for the rebooted Justice League, Throne of Atlantis, was quite strong. Despite all of that I don't mind the switch in this movie. That's partly because I've never been heavily invested in either character to care which one is on the main roster (I'd rather Martian Manhunter over either anyway). But it's also partly because I think the immaturity of Billy works well within the story.

Part of the problem with the comic this movie is based, along with all the other problems I listed, is that it was never even remotely believable to me (even with the general suspension of disbelief that's required to read comics) that Superman. Wonder Woman, and Aquaman (all somewhat diplomatic figures) would be as immature as they're depicted. In that original comic it never felt like there was an adult in the room, despite all of them being adults. I think with the introduction of Billy, instead of Arthur, the dysfunctional nature of the team makes more sense because there is, quite literally, a child on the team. The immaturity of Billy forced Hal to reexamine his behavior, and forced Wonder Woman to take charge. And the dynamic between Billy and Victor I found charming and unique to the team.

In either case, I can understand Aquaman fans being a bit upset but I'd say give the movie a chance. There may even be a surprise for the Aquaman fans ::wink wink::

I wrote this long review because no one else here has seen it yet, so hopefully this will help people out there on the fence make a decision. I really wanted to reach out to the fellow Superman fans out there that have been concerned with the way he's been portrayed in the New 52 (except for Unchained, that's an amazing comic). He's a bit different, but he's not the horrible mess that he was in the comic this is based off of. We're given those heroic moments we've come to expect from him, and he also beats down Batman, so enjoy it :)",1390262400,238,6696,4.503294892915981

8622275,2,B00GD9GNEY,"What can it be said? DC Comics has decided to have the good idea to created and animated universe of their New 52/Flashpoint stories. Got to say this is really cool. Starting with Flashpoint, it then continues with this, an adaptation of its Justice League Origin. I guess Origin doesn't sound as cool as war as this what you get out this collection.

All things considered this is pretty good, unfortunately it has a ton of flaws. While DC Animated does its best to be loyal to its original story, it also wants to be original. So most of the story is told with a style that isn't the same to Geoff Johns original story, even if some of the events are intact. The art is similar but not as great as Jim Lee's work. The characters costumes and looks are different, sort of anime. The atmosphere of the show is dark, but adds an awkward comedic element similar to Michael Bay's Transformers series.

They also could have added more depth to the story, like the origins of each superhero other than Cyborg. Thankfully they were kind to have Jason O'Mara have his own DC Animated Batman movies, I just wish Superman, Wonder Woman and the rest get their own.

There are still some good moments, a modest soundtrack, I love Superman and Wonder Woman's relationship. The heroes do a convincing job at uniting to save the world. Nice adding Shazam to the story, in many ways superior to having Aquaman. D+ Close to being okay but not that close.",1518739200,,1438,4.523076923076923
