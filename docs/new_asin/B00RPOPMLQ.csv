6934192,5,B00RPOPMLQ,"I try not to waste my time reviewing movies I don't like, as there are plenty of people out there who are more than willing to do that.  Sometimes, however, I watch a movie that I really enjoy but cant seem to put my finger on why.  Dark Disciple is one such example.  It certainly has its share of flaws.  The story is somewhat confusing at times and I had to watch it a second time to get the complete picture.  I was also annoyed by one particular scene in which private investigators uncovered who the Dark Disciple was without explaining how they made their discovery.  However, I really got caught up in the story and with the characters during my second viewing.  I especially enjoyed the absolutely crazy and insane ending!  I would describe Dark Disciple as an action/horror film.  The fight sequences are spectacular for a low-budget film and the horror moments are very suspenseful.  I jumped several times even during my second viewing.  People seem to be split on this film.  You will probably either love it or hate it, but you will probably not be in between.  Obviously, I liked it.  This is a fantastic film that I will be recommending to several of my friends.",1432857600,5,1178,4.5476190476190474
6934193,1,B00RPOPMLQ,"Very disappointing.  It was very creepy, a psycho killing and killing, blood and guts.  Could not finish the movie.  Do not recommend.",1432252800,,134,5.0

6934199,1,B00RPOPMLQ,"WOW!  Thhey spent more $$ on the movie cover than the movie, and the actors must have been pulled from the local bar. From now on I won't be purchasing any movies that don't have trailers. Tried to cancel the movie order after 5 min and Amazon said that I passed my 24hr rental time and cannot be reimbursed!  COME ON AMAZON!  WTH?  Total BS movie, don't be fooled by their impressive marketing intro, they obviously spent more time crafting it than the movie dialog.",1429833600,4,467,4.458823529411765
6934200,4,B00RPOPMLQ,I thought the movie played well.  The hero did something that I had never seen before:  He reads from the Bible to receive his inspiration.,1429315200,2,139,4.52

6934204,1,B00RPOPMLQ,one of the worse movies i've tried to watch.  Looks like someone's tax write-off.  Nothing thrilling about this flick.  Save your $$$,1428624000,,133,4.954545454545454

6934208,1,B00RPOPMLQ,couldn't finish this amateurish attempt,1428019200,,39,7.0
6934209,2,B00RPOPMLQ,Very difficult to watch because of the narrator. Would have worked better as a movie than a documentation type!  Had great potential. I had to see because i work in the building in front of where it was shot. Cordage in Plymouth is haunted! always has been! The history here has many unexplained deaths and that smoke stack!! Those buildings are no longer there and so glad that it was put on some kind of film. Area definately creepy!  Like I said would have worked better if that narrator wasn't involved (like an old dragnet!). but good try.,1428019200,5,544,4.540816326530612
6934210,1,B00RPOPMLQ,It was just awful..did not even finish it,1427846400,,41,4.25
6934211,5,B00RPOPMLQ,a must see. Can't wait for the sequel.,1427587200,,38,3.875
6934212,4,B00RPOPMLQ,"While five stars seems a bit generous, giving it one star is just plain ridiculous. I give it a 4.3 because it deserves it!  That's a lot more balanced and genuine than some of the other reviews I've read.  As an aspiring film maker, I loved it for what it is; a fun, exciting indie thriller that is extremely well made.  FYI, the third act will blow you away!",1427500800,4,360,4.188405797101449
6934213,1,B00RPOPMLQ,"This is my first review.  The movie was a great disappointment, a waste of money and time, and I will tell you as much.  The glaring problems with this film are its nave depictions of goth kids, substandard acting and generally poor direction, not to mention it's loaded like a baked potato with clichs.  The film has a fuzzy timeline, a ""Rocky""-like ""getting strong now"" sequence, lacks an explanation of the Dark Disciple's origin, and finishes it all off with a nonsensical ending.

I would also like to note: why are ""reviewers"" getting peeved at bad reviews?  My theory is that the screenwriter or someone highly involved in the movie is writing all the positive reviews; clearly someone struck a nerve with (screenwriter?) Barry Z.  Nobody gets so defensive on reviews.  Note: out of 14 5-star reviews, only 2 of them have had an account that's more than one month old at time of review; the other 12 have only critiqued Dark Disciple.  7 out of 9 1-star reviews go back several years and have reviewed multiple movies as opposed to just Dark Disciple.  The phony reviews are quite a disappointment.

If you watch the movie after reading this review, I told you so.",1427500800,20,1171,4.696078431372549
6934214,1,B00RPOPMLQ,"Bad acting, poor dialog, turned off after 10 minutes. Not good.",1427155200,4,63,4.818181818181818
6934215,1,B00RPOPMLQ,"So disappointed.  Cheesy, poor acting, slow moving, low budget.  Would love to have our money back.  Couldn't watch the whole thing and wish we could get back the twenty minutes we invested in it.  It may have gotten better but we couldn't stomach it any longer. Save your money and more importantly your time.",1426982400,3,310,4.685185185185185
6934216,1,B00RPOPMLQ,"Read the cliched writing in the reviews of Jan 15-17, 2015 and tell me they are not the same person.  Then watch the movie and tell me that the writer is not the same person has the one who wrote those reviews.  There is a peculiar kind of stupidity of people who express themselves in cliches.

In all honesty, though, there is another kind of stupidity of people who read fake reviews and get roped into to watching something like this.",1426809600,2,438,4.382716049382716

6934219,1,B00RPOPMLQ,"the problem was amateur directing, good actors struggling with slow pace, blurry fight scenes, and bad lighting, too many unnecessary scenes of trivia.  I didn't make to the end.",1425772800,3,178,5.137931034482759

6934221,5,B00RPOPMLQ,"The Final Version of ""Dark Disciple""!

I would like to express my deep appreciation to a very talented cast and crew for your excellence and commitment to this project. Although it's been a challenging journey, I believe you'll find this finished product worth the wait.

And to those viewers who took the time to review the preliminary version of ""Dark Disciple"" and write a critique, ""Thank You"". The reviews (even the harsh ones) are greatly appreciated, as they gave us the pulse of what improvements/changes were needed in order to bring this film to the next level.

""Dark Disciple"" is also a testament to what can be accomplished if you don't quit. As I couldn't afford film school, so I trained for years on the side. With only a four person core production crew, we worked extra hard to take up the slack. And, although we had a limited budget, we determined that what we lacked in finances we would make up for with good, old fashioned ingenuity (building our own dolly, crane, steady-cam, studio lights, sets and unique theatrical weapons).

Thank you all again for committing your time and talent to help make this film a reality.

Sincerely,
Allan Caggiano",1425340800,20,1169,4.796019900497512

6934228,5,B00RPOPMLQ,"Saw this during the limited theatrical release and loved it. Unreal action scenes. Definitely look foward to more movies being put out by these guys. Not sure what the review stating its ""only 40minutes"" is talking about. The movie runs about an hour and a half, but to each his own, everyone has different taste. Saw this with a bunch a friends and we all loved it. We are action junkies and enjoy a good thrill ride. If thats your thing, I highly recommend it and I will be ordering this movie soon off amazon.",1423008000,6,512,4.4

8695742,3,B00RPOPMLQ,"Much effort obviously went into the production of this movie.  I viewed the trailer (which can be googled), and I rented the movie through Amazon.  The writer/producer/actor wore many hats.  I give him credit for his effort.  More research on the nature of the Goth subculture should have been done, as they were misrepresented.  The writer would have been wise to seek others advice while writing and making the movie.  Transition between scenes/acts would have looked better without the use of long black fade outs by utilizing just fade ins. The movie needs a better flow, some scenes eliminated, other scenes rearranged, a lighter atmosphere and some laughable moments. Much of the filming of the buildings, boats, and outside scenery is very good. Many of the actors were good, especially the Chief.  I'm trying to figure out the rationale for the persona of the Dark Disciple, where he came from, the objective/reasoning for his killing, what brought the Dark Disciple to his psychosis, etc.  Many questions remain unanswered on the reasoning for the character of the Dark Disciple, other than he's a deranged killer.  There is no rationale for the other killers popping up at the end of the movie, other than to have a hand to hand combat scene between the antagonist and protagonist in an attempt to achieve more of a climatic ending.  Good effort.",1472515200,,1356,4.933920704845815
