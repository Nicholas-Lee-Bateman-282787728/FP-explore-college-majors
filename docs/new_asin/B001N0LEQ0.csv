8322790,1,B001N0LEQ0,This video purchase was not at all helpful to my understanding of the value of laughter yoga.  I felt it was a waste of money.  Sorry!,1245628800,7,134,4.115384615384615
8322791,1,B001N0LEQ0,"If you want to be a spectator of a Laughter Yoga class, then this CD is perfect for you.  The intro was good - talked about the history and purpose of Laughter Yoga.  The rest of the video is just watching them do the session without any explanation of what they are doing or why they are doing it.  The sound quality is also horrible.  There was even a loud plane flyng over at one point that was very distracting.  I don't recommend this video.",1245369600,9,446,4.2
8322792,1,B001N0LEQ0,"I was excited to find this disc, since there's very little English-language material available on laughter yoga. I was less excited to watch it, since it turned out to be a sloppy and useless home iMovie project. Four people meet up in New York's Central Park. A blonde lady hogs the camera and seems extremely pleased with herself. She flirts extremely with a man who is tall dark and handsome; it is unclear whether he reciprocates her feelings, or isn't into girls. There is interminable bad dancing. There is virtually no laughter yoga except the basic Ho-Ho-Ho-Ha-Ha-Ha exercise, which is done quite quickly and not discussed. There is no guidance or advice on laughter yoga.

A Japanese man, identified late in the feature as a former Kabuki actor, appears to despise the others, who may have paid him to be there; he laughs almost not at all. Central Park strangers are often in the frame; they appear harassed and angry. The talentless dancing and rudimentary exercise last about ten minutes, followed by a far longer ""Interview with the Cast,"" in which the camcorder owners talk about how they're brilliant professional dancers and really like themselves. The Kabuki actor briefly performs a Japanese stage laugh, mannered, astonishing, full of history and culture and -- I say it measuredly -- magic.

Then the moment is gone. The troglodytic others silence him with their braindead yakking, and the tragedy is complete.

Zero stars.",1244592000,17,1443,5.004166666666666
8322793,5,B001N0LEQ0,"A twenty minute laughter class that is so light, fun, & basically hysterical.  What a gift to laugh & lighten up like this.  The Inner Smile Meditation following provided such a deep state of peace...
All in all, Great!",1237075200,2,219,4.589743589743589
