8071477,5,B000A0GXOW,"As a parent, I KNOW I am extremely picky when it comes to movies and books.  As a Catholic, I want the stories to be accurate portrayals of the saints.  Well, this one is great in both regards.  Since I always preview any movies the kids watch, I have had to suffer through many preschool/elementary school movies. This one was actually a joy for even me to watch.  Great, exciting story that will hold the kids attention AND share the greatness of a great saint!

So far I've seen 4 of the CCC's saint series and this one is one of the most exciting. Somehow they seem to really pull the kids in and make it interesting. My kids are REALLY connecting with the stories of the saints!  So the kids definitely give it two thumbs up for excitement, at least in our household of ages 8 to 1 year!",1300492800,3,792,4.246666666666667
8071478,5,B000A0GXOW,"Who was Francis Xavier? Why was he treasure hunting? How are samurais involved with this treasure? These are questions the viewer might ask before plopping down money to purchase this children's video or pressing the Play button to view it.

""Francis Xavier and the Samurai's Lost Treasure"" is the animated story of St. Francis Xavier (1502-1556), an athlete/scholar who became a missionary of the Roman Catholic church, first to India, then to Japan. (He was co-founder of the Society of Jesus--Jesuits, and according to Wikipedia, is second after St. Paul, to leading people to Christianity. The other co-founder was Xavier's best friend, St. Ignatius of Loyola.)

The video shows the friendship of Xavier and Ignatius at university and how Xavier became a Christian through Ignatius's example. From that point Xavier's work as a missionary is telescoped to India, where he carried the Word among pearl divers who lived on a small island. There he became friends with a samurai, a self-imposed exile from Japan. This friendship would eventually lead Xavier to missionary work in Japan.

The lost treasure of the title involves a black pearl, cause of the samurai's departure. Once in Japan, Xavier collects the pearl from the bottom of a canal where vicious caimans live and snap around. Only a miracle could save Xavier from being torn to pieces. But people of faith are known to be involved in miracles.

I am librarian at a Catholic school for PK3-8. Next door is the cathedral. On the other side is Loyola, a Catholic high school. One way that Catholic children learn about saints is through teachers. Another is the librarian who can show wonderful videos. Another connection is that there are three boys is our school, whose names are Xavier.

CCC of America produces this series of videos about the lives of saints. The illustrations are beautiful; the histories are accurate. And best, children remember the details.",1202428800,11,1926,5.044025157232705
