8627435,5,B00GTSVPYM,"I knew this movie existed, but hadn't seen it for sale before. Don't know why they had to mess with the title. The disc is produced from the studio tape, and carries the actual title of ""Bob, Son of Battle."" If you haven't read the book, it is back in print!",1499904000,,258,4.078431372549019
8627436,5,B00GTSVPYM,"I hadn't seen this film in probably fifty years, and yet I remembered some scenes very clearly. I was delighted with this purchase, a film remarkably faithful to Alfred Olivant's novel ""Bob, Son of Battle,"" down to a lot of the heartbreaking dialogue.

Just recently I read Bosley Crowther's New York Times review of the film, which makes the astonishingly incorrect observation: ""A small thing but sharply significant is the fact that a dog's name has been changed from Black Wull to Red Wull in the screenplay of 'Bob, Son of Battle,' which has been filmed by Twentieth Century-Fox under the title of 'Thunder in the Valley' and which was presented at the Roxy yesterday. For, although this slight switch was obviously prompted by the fact that the animal playing this key role is red instead of black and, since the film is made in Technicolor, it was either change the name or change the dog, it betokens the general redesigning of this classic story to fit the Technicolor vogue."" **

The dog's name was always Red Wull. Hadn't Crowther read the book?

If you like a good story, fine acting (ah, Edmund Gwenn!), splendid sheep-herding scenes, and possibly a good cry, here's a movie for you.

' Thunder in the Valley,' Story of Sheep-dogs in Scotland, New Film at the Roxy

By BOSLEY CROWTHER

A small thing but sharply significant is the fact that a dog's name has been changed from Black Wull to Red Wull in the screenplay of ""Bob, Son of Battle,"" which has been filmed by Twentieth Century-Fox under the title of ""Thunder in the Valley"" and which was presented at the Roxy yesterday.
