834539,3,6304268246,"I first saw Battle Creek Brawl in the first English film release. I've been looking for it ever since, and finally found that It had two names. Battle Creek Brawl, and the version I saw which was titled The Big Brawl. The film itself has great humor, and a lot of style in the fights. Particularly, the duel between Jacky and his cane wielding uncle, the big brawl at the end, and the fight with the brothers. All are classic Chan, and very watchable.
The negative to this version is it's in Chinese, and it's been so horrifically clipped for Pan and Scan, and you can't read the English subtitles for about 70% of the movie. If I hadn't already seen the film in English, I'd still be wondering what happened.",1015804800,,709,4.419847328244275

834700,4,6304268246,"Its weird to think that there once was a time when the whole world didn't know about Jackie Chan. Its even weirder to realize that at one time, he was introduced to us but we didn't think to remember him. Battle Creek Brawl is odd for being a Hong Kong-inspired movie before Hollywood knew the value of the HK influence. But while director Robert Clouse may have been unable to capitalize on Jackie Chan like he did&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bruce-Lee/dp/B00P0E0WTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bruce Lee</a>, this is still an exciting adventure and an interesting study of one of the earlier chapters of one of the genres top stars.

The story: A martial arts-practicing adventurer (Chan) runs afoul of a Chicago crime syndicate and is strong-armed into competing in an all-important toughman contest.

While there are plenty of criticisms to be leveled at this film, I don't accept its departure from the style of other JC movies as one of them. Director Clouse isn't Stanley Tong, and he doesnt need to be: his utilization of Jackie isn't the ideal standard, but someone as talented as Chan benefits from showing poise in alternative circumstances. Admittedly, one casualty of Clouses style is Chans comedy, which comes across as clumsy and childish, but his action scenes remain pretty swell. Almost none of his onscreen opponents approach Chans level of agility and they clearly aren't comfortable with the heros rhythmic style, but Jackies athletic abandon is matched by satisfying, stunt-heavy choreography. The filmmakers keep the camera pulled back, diminishing our boys facial expressions but showing off the authenticity of his abilities. Given that this was the first time Chan was being captured as a lead outside of Hong Kong, Im impressed with the results.

The production is on the modest side of respectable. Clouse works well in small, homey locations and pulls off the 1930s setting pretty smoothly. Disappointingly, the story and characters within the setting are not intriguing. The screenplay offers exactly one character and relationship that I found intriguing: dear old Mako (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sand-Pebbles/dp/B000059HAF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sand Pebbles</a>) in his surprisingly stern role as Jackies mentor. Everyone else, from Chans onscreen girlfriend (Kristine DeBell) to the evil champion (H.B. Haggerty), are simply varying shades of boring. Even Oscar-winner Jose Ferrer (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cyrano-de-Bergerac/dp/B0000D1FFU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cyrano de Bergerac</a>) is incredibly vanilla as the lead villain and doesnt enliven a story thats almost solely kept afloat by its lead stars infectious talent. Chan himself isn't at his best either, though this is mainly due to his discomfort with English at this point, and his physical expressiveness conveys a lot of what his dialogue doesnt.

Battle Creek Brawl teeters on a less enthusiastic rating, but eventually wins me over through its strengths. Its not surprising that this film didn't make Jackie Chan a household name, but its good enough to qualify as a collectors item for the right viewer. The one thing all viewers needs to do when watching is not expect&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rumble-in-the-Bronx/dp/0780619331/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rumble in the Bronx</a>, and if you manage that, youll probably have a good time.",1461196800,2,3539,5.960629921259843

834709,3,6304268246,"Battle Creek Brawl was originally released under the title The Big Brawl in late summer 1980.  When I first saw it back then, it was double-featured with a rerelease of Enter the Dragon.  Both movies were directed by Robert Clouse who, over the years, has tried to recapture the magic and success of Enter the Dragon.  But what made ETD an international hit was Bruce Lee, period.  When BCB was released, it was ""by the director of Enter the Dragon"".  Unfortunately, this was not the big vehicle for either Jackie Chan or Robert Clouse it had been hoped to be.

Battle Creek Brawl (BCB) is not a bad film, and when I first saw it in 1980, I enjoyed it.  But it was also the first Jackie Chan film I ever saw.  Then came Cannonball Run (1981).  I didn't begin really seeing Jackie's  films until 1982 in Chinese-language theaters.  After seeing his own work, watching BCB is like watching Jackie trying to perform while shackled.  He wasn't able to show much of anything, but it was still revelatory to many American audiences in 1980 who weren't familiar with his work.

A mistake people make is believing that Jackie didn't become a superstar until the 1995 American release of Rumble in the Bronx.  Wrong.  By the late 1970s and early '80s, Jackie was already a megastar in Asia, and his 1980 movie The Young Master outgrossed any of Bruce Lee's films in Hong Kong.  Jackie was also popular in many other parts of the world.  By the time Jackie became a name in America in '95, his popularity was already waning in Asia.

The one thing that BCB did establish for the U.S. audiences that did see it is that Jackie was not the next Bruce Lee, he was the first Jackie Chan, and he had  his own individual personality and attributes.  Only he wasn't allowed to show enough of those physical attributes.  Which has always been the problem when Jackie has made American movies.  During BCB, Jackie was approaching his physical and creative prime, yet had to hold back his talents considerably for Robert Clouse and the American stuntmen.  Anyone who has seen his best works overseas will know that.  That said, the characters played by Jackie, Mako and Kristine DeBell were still likable enough.  I would say that any good points of BCB worked in spite of Robert Clouse's directing, not because of it.",1421452800,,2297,4.612345679012345

835007,3,6304268246,"The Big Brawl(1980, also known as Battle Creek Brawl) is a decent martial arts-comedy. This was Hollywood's first attempt at making a movie starring Jackie Chan. Chan plays a Chinese-American who fights 1930's gangsters in order to save his sister-in-law(played by Rosalind Chao from MASH). The Big Brawl doesn't live up to its potential. Also, Chan is forced to emulate Bruce Lee. Jackie Chan reached stardom in Asia as an anti-Bruce Lee. This film takes place in the 1930's, yet it feels like 1980!
Director Robert Clouse tries to emulate 1970's trends such as roller skating. One of the better action scenes takes place on a stage where Chan is attacked by two Asian guys. Still, this movie was well made considered the limited budget and Lalo Schifrin's music score is somewhat catchy. The late Mako is quite good as Chan's on screen kung fu master. 1970's sex symbol Kristine DeBell played his love interest. Jose Ferrer plays a gangster who forces Chan's character to fight in a brawl in Texas. There's a funny sight gag where Mako is held hostage and he somehow ends up behind the guy holding him hostage!
The Big Brawl was made with the best intentions, but it still got clobbered by the competition in 1980. Jackie Chan tried to appeal to people in the US by making a cameo in The Cannonball Run(1981). One of Chan's misfires was starring in the trashy, violent, foul mouthed The Protector(1985). The Big Brawl is still worth a look.",1359676800,,1442,4.749003984063745

835147,5,6304268246,"I first saw this movie about 2 years after it was released when I was about 15 years old. It is my all time favorite movie. I fell in love with Jackie Chan immediately during the opening scene where he does gymnastics on the scaffolding. I wanted to be the American girlfriend in the movie. Now I'm turning 43 years old this month, and my kids and husband are fully aware that Jackie Chan is my ""boyfriend"". While watching Jackie Chan's The Spy Next Door movie with my kids last weekend, I decided that I really wanted to share this movie with them, so I just bought it from one of the retailers here on amazon.com. I have wanted a copy of this movie for years but was never able to find it, and eventually forgot about it until last weekend. I actually bought a movie poster of this movie about 10 years ago which I proudly hung in my office wall at a previous employer. I stood in line for hours in hopes of getting his signature when he came to town for a book signing years ago. But they stopped the book signing before I reached the front of the line. I was still happy to see him in person from a distance.

So I guess I'm a bit of a Jackie Chan fanatic. But I really think this is his best movie ever, despite the fact that it wasn't a hit when it was released in the U.S. In the Battle Creek Brawl, Jackie does amazing stunts and gymnastics. I love the crazy roller derby with fire hoses and other obstacles. And the fight scenes seem much more ""realistic"" than the highly choreographed ones of recent years. There is also plenty of Jackie's brand of comedy in the movie. Not to mention the fact that Jackie is so young and ""hot"" in this movie!",1286236800,2,1652,4.211356466876971

835149,2,6304268246,"Battlecreek Brawl, released in 1980, was Jackie Chan's first (and last, for many years) starring role in a North American film. While the sound and video has been restored, everything else about the movie leaves a lot to be desired. Chan's physical, linguistic and acting abilities are on par with more recent releases, but he just doesn't get the support he needs to make this movie great. This is most noticable in the fighting scenes, as he he seems to be mainly paired up with WWE-style wrestlers who can't actually fight worth a damn. As a result, Chan is best when on his own, and the movie ends up being a much better showcase of his acrobatic training than kung fu. Nor is Jackie the fight/stunt coordinator for this film -- that honor going to a rookie who later did the same for the Ninja Turtle and Karate Kid movies. So that should give you some kind of idea of the calibre of fighting going on here.

I think the other way this movie went awry was in the decision to make it a period piece, without the financial resources to do so. Anachronism abounds, most notably in a weird (and way too long) underground no-holds-barred roller-skate race where the contestants wear very 1970s satin tracksuits. Oy. When it comes time for the brawl, most of the spectators have feathered early 1980s hair and completely inappropriate clothing and eyeglasses, and many of the sets are lacking as well. It's just distracting. The decision to pit Chan's kung fu fighting successfully against prohibition-era gangsters requires the creation of some of the wimpiest gangsters ever seen, who perpetually forget that they have guns on them. The racist mobster grandmother also seems to be the only character whose social sensitivities seem accurate to the era, as I guffawed at the idea of a worked-up crowd of spectators in 1930s Texas cheering wildly as a Chinese man kissed his caucasian girlfriend.

Take home message - this movie required more suspension of disbelief than I had to offer, without any kind of payoff for the effort. I love Jackie Chan, but this was a regrettable purchase. Who Am I?, The Acccidental Spy, Police Story, or Legend of the Drunken Master are much better choices.",1251676800,,2189,4.773087071240106

Relying on Kwan's kung fu skills, The gangsters hope to make big bucks, only problem is Jerry must survive against huge opponents. This is the film that tried to introduce Jackie Chan to American audiences in 1980 as the new Bruce Lee. The Big Brawl rises above most other martial arts films, entertaining on many levels using comedy, stunts, acrobatics, convincing acting skills, and of course kung fu. During a roller skating competition for a cash prize (the most brutal one you'll ever see), Chan's group competes against two other groups and faces a gauntlet of fire hoses, audience interference, and high jumps all while beating the piss out of each other! No speeding up the film for the fights here (unlike Jackie's HK films), still Chan is very fast and outmaneuvering everyone including some monster sized wrestlers. Mako as the uncle/kung fu instructor, matches Chan's intensity and turns in a brilliant performance. The exciting training scenes are inventive and funny. Rival gangsters betting against Kwan, kidnap his uncle and want him to take a ""dive"" resulting in a suspense filled showdown with mafia thugs in a movie theater. Lalo Schifrin's music delivers great support to all the action, creating serious tension. 16x9 dvd picture and audio is not as good as it should be coming from fox.

When Chan broke contract with Lo Wei for Golden Harvest and five million HK dollars, Lo wanted to do everything he could to get Jackie back (or punish him) even deal with the Triad group Sun Yi On to do this. Jimmy Wang Yu, whom Jackie worked with in The Killer Meteors and had Triad influence, offered to broker a deal between the three parties. He would later require a few favors such as Jackie to appear in Island of Fire and Fantasy Mission Force. Jimmy was quite successful in his talks with the three parties early in Jackie's foreign journey, but Jackie would have to appear in two American films: star in The Big Brawl and have a small part in the horrific Cannonball Run while running the emotional gamut known as the American Press.

Battle Creek Brawl aka The Big Brawl is a mediocre attempt at trying to showcase Jackie's skills. While it is not as bad as the American version of his second attempt - The Protector - it was still only an OK film. It was directed by Robert Clouse (Enter the Dragon and the craptacular Game of Death) but he was relegated to B-movie fare at this point in his career though he would later direct Gymkata. Clouse's static style conflicted with the dynamic nature of Jackie. Though there were several other areas of annoyance for Chan including his working with a language that he did not understand at the time and a stunt coordinator who did not understand his style.

Jackie stars as Jerry Kwan, a prodigal martial art student studying under his uncle Herbert Kwan (played by the prolific Japanese actor Mako) in the late 20's or early 30's Chicago. Herbert is a chiropractor when he is not torturing Jackie or going after large women. He is a disappointment to his father, even when he breaks up extortionists of his father's restaurant, who wants him to be more like his brother Robert, the Doctor. Jerry's fighting ability gets the attention of Dominichi (Jose Ferrer) a local gangster and obtains the ire of his nephew David Leggetti. Dominichi needs a fighter to be able to beat his nemesis, Mr. Morgan, who has control of a beast of a man Billy Kiss who kisses his opponents, sometimes a bit long, after he wins (played by H.B. Haggerty who looks like a 19th century circus strong man.)

For Dominichi to control Jerry he kidnaps his brother's soon-to-be fianc from China named Mae (Rosalind Chao who is forever known by Trekkers as Keiko O'Brien.) He then enters Jerry in a fighting contest called the Battle Creek Brawl which takes place in Texas. The purse is 15,000 dollars (which seems ridiculously low now.) The biggest problem with this contest is that all the fighters resemble professional wrestlers (yes the great Gene Le Bell is amongst them) and not fighters. This is especially evident in the beginning brawl-for-all where there is a camel clutch, body slams and plenty of large men in tights. The fighters are incredibly slow compared to Jackie, but they do add certain campyness to the film (or do the capes and tights make this point already evident.)

One of the more interesting scenes took place earlier in the film when Jackie is part of a relay roller derby contest. He would also use this new found skill of roller skating in an awesome stunt sequence in Winners and Sinners. But the rest of the film never quite captures my interest the way that scene does. The romance between Jerry and Nancy was handled in an interesting nonchalant manner though. I also did like some of the fight scenes, but not as much as most of Jackie's Hong Kong fight scenes. I am glad that he was able to add humor to several parts of the film. I would not recommend this film to most people, because there are so many better ""Jackie"" films to watch. I did find this a nice diversion and not as bad as many of the American fight films of that era. NOTES: stunt coordinator Pat E. Johnson has his name on the fighter's tournament chalk board. Some versions (especially early Hong Kong prints) of this film take out the relationship scenes between Nancy and Jerry.",1184198400,,4159,4.62381596752368

It was the first movie Jackie made in the U.S. And it is my favorite. I instantly fell in love with Jackie when I saw this movie. Maybe I like it so much because it's more of a ""chick-flick"" than his other movies. I love the funny romantic seens between Jackie and his American girlfriend in this movie. I love the roller derby scenes. And I drool over Jackie's muscles at the opening scene when he shows off his gymnastic talents on the scaffolding.

835281,1,6304268246,"Ever wonder why someone as amazing as Jackie Chan didn't catch on sooner in America?  ""Battle Creek Brawl"" is a big reason why.

This train wreck occurred when the producers of the classic ""Enter The Dragon"" were teamed with Jackie Chan.  The big difference?  Bruce Lee had control over his movie and no qualms about voicing his opinion.  Jackie on the other hand, had no control or influence over this film.  The result is a convoluted mess with the worst Jackie Chan fight scenes you will ever see, but what can you expect when he is fighting untrained actors instead of martial artists?  My recommendation would be to avoid this movie unless you want to see what happens when the 1930s meet roller derbies, mid-century automobiles and really bad professional wrestling.",1123804800,5,772,4.847328244274809

835283,4,6304268246,"Warner Bros thought Jackie Chan might be the next big Kung Fu star after Bruce Lee's death - they were right, just 15 years too early.  This film was directed by Robert Clouse and released in the USA in 1980.  Unfortunately, in the early 1980's, American audiences were not ready for Jackie Chan's comedic/fighting style and/or two martial arts stars at the same time (Chuck Norris already at three profitable films under his belt).

This film, however, is a gem.  It is funny, reasonably well directed, and the acting is actually very good.  Jackie and Mako produce good chemistry as Uncle/teacher (Make) and nephew/student (Chan).  Jose Ferrer is good as the gangster who coerces Chan into entering the winner take all fight in Battle Creek Texas.

The fight scenes, although not great, are fun and the last 25 minutes is almost pure action and it is here where Jackie is most fun to watch.  Originally released as the Big Brawl, this is a good movie and in today's movie rating system, it would at most bring in a PG-13 rating, so disregard the ""R"" rating on the DVD sales.",1094947200,19,1076,4.656084656084656
