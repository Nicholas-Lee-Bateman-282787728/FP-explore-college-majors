1779832,1,B00006JDUY,"Having lived with the VHS version for many years and having used it as an adjunct to my regular jazz teaching routine. I excitedly looked forward to (what I expected to be its great) update into the digital format.  Upon receiving the DVD, I sat down to hear it - in what I hoped would be its ultimate form), hit the start button & reeled backed horror.  The picture quality was totally degraded, the sound - dreadful - and all I can say is that the manufacturers have done an unspeakable dis-service to one of the great historic and visual masterpieces of jazz history. Avoid the DVD -stick with the VHS until the current producers get their act together.",1044835200,12,656,4.504201680672269
1779833,5,B00006JDUY,"Even forty-six years can't dim these performances by some of the greatest mainstream jazz performers. Presented in a televison studio arranged for the best possbile sound, raher than ""looks,"" the musicians were comfortable, and played beautifully.
John Crosby's introductions are brief, and we're treated to almost an hour of music. As another review noted, Monk's ""Blue Monk"" performance is missing, and instead we have three ""Bonus Tracks"" of audio. One is worthwhile- Coleman Hawkins' extended solo improvisation ""Dali,"" similar to the ""Picasso"" he recorded for Norman Granz. There's also a Red Allen-Hawkins collaboration in a dixie vein as well as what purports to be ""Sarah Vaughn singing East of the Sun,"" and turns out to be George Shearing playing Jumpin' for Symphony Sid."" (!) Kind of a sloppy production for Jerry Valburn who has produced some great record reissues.
Neverthless, if you're interested in seeing the best jazz show ever presented on televison, you need this DVD. And the price is right.",1043452800,,1013,5.2592592592592595
1779834,3,B00006JDUY,"Quality wise, this is a vast improvement over the VHS version of the Sound of Jazz -- which looked like it was recorded underwater.  As the above reviewer states, there is no performance by Thelonious Monk -- though he did appear in this program and his group is listed in the end credits.  The packaging has no notes inside of any kind and, inexplicably, has a photo of Charlie Parker on the back -- who never appeared in this program.  So, a mixed bag, but --until someone issues a better version -- it is worth having.",1043193600,2,521,4.40625

7970112,1,B00006JDUY,"This is a disgraceful reissue. The best tv show featuring jazz ever is hacked up and cut down without any acknowledgement. Thelonious Monk doesn't appear, except in the credits. I can't imagine why this was done, but it should be taken off the market.",1174953600,4,251,4.7272727272727275
7970113,1,B00006JDUY,"Please do not buy this horrible version of one of the greatest jazz shows ever. The picture quality is absolutely terrible, and the disc's producer left off the Thelonious Monk segment without mentioning that it is missing, probably for legal reasons. Whatever the reason, it is unconscionable to present this disc without acknowledging that it is not the complete show. This product should not even be offered for sale.

You can get the complete Sound Of Jazz, with all the great performances that the other reviewers have mentioned, in a very good transfer, in the 2-disc set The Greatest Jazz Films Ever (produced by EFOR films), also available through amazon, which also includes the film Jamming The Blues, all the known Charlie Parker footage, a kinescope of the CBS special the Sound of Miles Davis (with John Coltrane), and other gems. I believe there is also another single-disc set from the same company (EFOR) that just has the Sound of Jazz and one other show on it.

The show itself is unbelievably great. But this kind of dishonesty and shoddy presentation is really a disgrace. Search out the above-mentioned complete versions instead.",1172534400,6,1150,4.984375
7970114,5,B00006JDUY,"A friend of mine on Yahoo has explained that I confused this DVD with the full and official DVD of the Sound of Jazz.  He writes ""I'd like you to explain how your review of the DVD ""Sound of Jazz"" has got nothing to do with the DVD's actual contents. there is no Monk on it, no Ahmad Jahmal, the picture quality is awful, e.g. the DVD is a rip-off pirate job (prod. by Music video, Oaks, PA).""

 Please get another version, an authorized version.  Here is my original review:

I had heard the LP put out in the 1950s of this great program. I have owned it on tape. I've seen portions of the performances in Jazz documentaries over the decades. I even bought the VHS as a Christmas present for my Dad.

Simply nothing prepared me for how much fun and joy it was to watch this. Nothing!

The story goes that this was underwritten by a wealthy Jazz lover who paid for such a great bevy of Jazz legends to be gathered in the studio that it included the three greatest tenor men in Jazz history--Lester Young, Coleman Hawkins, and Ben Webster--Basie and Freddie Green reunited with Joe Jones, Danny Barker, Billie Holiday, Buck Clayton, Milt Hinton, Hank Jones, Thelonius Monk, Pee Wee Russel, Jimmy Jufree (know I can't spell that right), and others I have probably forgetten like the great Vic Dickinson and the super great Jimmie Rushing.

Seeing all these musicians together, jamming, though most of the big band events are really united by the principles of Basieism Old Testment style with the sold All-America Rhythm Section beat provided by the three originals, Basie, Green, and Jones with Eddie Jones filling in more than adequately on base. You have a lot of that with Old Testment Baseites like Rushing, Morton, and Dickinson returning to join the Count and barely any of the new Testament crowd in evidence. Of course, on top of these soloists having Coleman Hawkins and Ben Webster just in the room, let alone playing their horns, was probably Basie's dream.

The only concession to Bop Here is Thelonius Monk who plays a cool version of Blue Monk supported by his own bass and drums. Monk said having Count Basie staring at him on the other side of the piano during his tune didn't exactly make him happy, but you won't notice that on the DVD.

Generally, seeing the reactions of the different musicians to others playing is one of the best things about this DVD. I especially love seeing Jimmie Rushing and Billie digging the band sessions just walking around singing. I have heard on live recordings like Basie at Newport, the impact of Jimmie Rushing's encouragment and hand clapping and shouting to swing the Basie band, and heard more about that from elders who were there, but to see this actually happening, and to see as well as hear Jimmie sing, oh my oh my, why don't I go home and spend all day playing this over and over.

The most famous part of this DVD is the Billie's performance of Fine and Mellow with Lester Young Soloing. Folks have written songs and poems just about this one cut long before this thing was available on video. They say when it was over everyone in the TV control room was in tears.

Lester was not well that day and so he only participated in this one cut. He played in the slow, deliberate understated way he did when his body wasn't up to the punishment he was giving it by drinking a quart of bourbon every day for 10 years! His great collaboration with Billie Holiday from 1937 to 1941 had ended when Billie became a heroin addict because Prez refused to have anything to do with anyone who used needles. And this was a great moment to see the artistry pouring out of both of them, even though they had both destroyed the bodies that had made them great artists in the 1930s and 1940s.

As much as I have worshipped Lester's solo and Billie's singing on this track, recognition needs to be given to Ben Webster's solo on this tune. Webster had actually been working with Billie in the great set of Verve recordings they did with folks like Harry Sweets Edison. In fact, while Lester's work with Billie in the 1930s is the true masterpiece of vocalist instrumentalist collaboration, Webster and Sweets later work needs some mention.

Jerry Mulligan's solo on Fine and Mellow would also be famous were it not for the Lester/Billie connection. You not only hear it but you can see Ben Webster and Coleman Hawkins being wowed by Mulligan's playing.

In fact, besides the overwhelming fact of the superiority of the swinging nature of Basieism, the thing that impressed me most was the playing of Webster and Coleman Hawkins who were veterans of the 1930s--and in Hawkin's case the 1920s--who could still play it hard, dirty, and almost bopish in the 1950s.

Juffre's third-stream number is interesting, although it mainly impresses one with how pallid 3-d stream and ""cool"" or ""West Coast"" Jazz was compared to Black swing and Dixieland or bop. We get to see this vividly when Juffre and Pee Wee Russell trade clarinet solos on a blues jam afterwards. Juffre is clearly slumping off compared to the strength drive and dirtiness of Russel.

The cult-hero of this film is the great drummer Joe Jones who appears with every one of the ensembles. His drumming is relaxed, fluid, time keeping, and his interaction with the other players is one of the most interesting things in the film.
In the clarinet duo, we can see him kind of grimacing and being a little irked and bored while Juffre plays while he brightens up for Russell. I really like digging him when he has the big band going and the old Basieite rhythm is being revived.

On the DVD you get two extras, sets that were cut from the broadcast that are not on the LP. One is a forgettable Ahmad Jamal trio performance where Jamal focuses on pyrotechnics and not swing, on demonstrating his technical skills without really communicating much musically. He is immediately shown up by the playing of the great Hank Jones in an ensemble led by Ben Webster that includes Buck Clayton and Vick Dickinson (it would be interesting to know why Clayton never plays in the Basie sets since at the time Clayton was making his famous Buck Clayton Breakdowns which were recordings of Baseites and Southwestern era musicans creating old testament Basie music after Basie had gone on to the new.)

Oh how could I forget the two numbers done by a traditional jazz combo led by Red Allen. There is some really great playing by Allen and by Vick Dickinson and Coleman Hawkins.

This is simply so good that you are going to play this like a record, over and over again.",1121299200,7,6552,4.607725321888412
7970115,1,B00006JDUY,"The previous reviewers are right on the money.  This is one of the greatest jazz films ever made, but this particular edition is a cheapo rip-off with truly rotten picture and sound quality.  It seems to have been made from an umpteenth-generation videotape copy of a scratchy old kinescope.  Don't waste your money!  Wait for whoever owns the rights to do it properly; in the meantime, get the authorized VHS version.",1074384000,5,418,4.845070422535211
7970116,3,B00006JDUY,"Updating my earlier review: I just found out this show is available - in a much better transfer (picture/sound) in a DVD-edition called ""JAZZ MASTERS - VINTAGE COLLECTION 1958-1961"". I urge everybody interested in this excellent/exceptional/magical show to check out this edition!!!
It also includes the THELONIOUS MONK TRIO performing ""Blue Monk"" - which the present edition mysteriously omits...
In addition: An extra disc with additional material, a.o. an excellent performance of ""So What"" by Miles Davis...
So my advice is: Avoid this edition - check out the one mentioned above - and enjoy the greatest jazz ever captured by a camera...
The standout track is the one with Billie Holiday in her own composition FINE AND MELLOW - one of her last performances. This was also the last time she performed together with her lifelong friend/soulmate/lover Lester Young. When he solos, it's almost as you can see his notes touching her...",1056672000,48,936,5.1644736842105265
7970117,1,B00006JDUY,"My rating relates to the production of this DVD and not the musical content, which is wonderful and transcends the technical shortcomings. Let's start with the sleeve. Lee Jeske, N.Y.Post writes ""Stunning...beautifully presented."" Was this a review of the original airing? It surely can't refer to this issue. We have a picture of Charlie Parker on the back. Why? Also Billy Strayhorn's ""Take The A Train"" is credited. What we don't have is a track listing or any personnel details. The DVD could have had adverts for other programmes edited out - I don't really want to know who's on the Ed Sullivan Show at the expense of Thelonious Monk's ""Blue Monk"". One of the three audio bonus tracks should be Sarah Vaughan singing ""East Of The Sun"". Instead we get, I think, George Shearing playing ""Jumping With Symphony Sid"". This really poor effort should be withdrawn and reissued with the care that jazz of this stature deserves - and next time find a producer who knows something about jazz! If you've got this on VHS, stick with it.",1050105600,5,1031,4.76536312849162
7970118,1,B00006JDUY,"I wonder why this disc is so horrible: the video is unwatchable, the sound is poor... And every time I saw some excerpts of this historical event, at some TV shows, the quality was very good. Do not purchase this item.",1045008000,15,218,4.341463414634147
