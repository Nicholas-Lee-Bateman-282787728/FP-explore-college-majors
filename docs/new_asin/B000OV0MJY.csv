8186816,4,B000OV0MJY,"I imagined that this movie was going to be one big Trabi joke, but it's more than that. It tracks an East German teacher, his wife and their teenaged daughter as they follow Goethe's late 18th century journey from Germany to Naples. I left out one character in that list, Georgie, the Trabant itself, the great East German every man's car, half plastic, underpowered, and almost a standing joke even before the wall fell. At one level this is one of those little movies, a family comedy with the husband and wife renewing their affection on their journey, and their teenaged daughter getting a glimpse of her parents as people, not just as parents. At another level, it is about East Germany's reunification with the west and fall of the iron curtain. following Goethe's journey would have been impossible had the wall not fallen. Such a journey could have died as little more than a dream, but thanks to a sturdy Trabi and a major geopolitical collapse it turned into a fair bit more.

P.S. There are no subtitles in any released version of this movie, but you can find subtitles on line. The humor, at points, is pretty broad, but having some subtitles handy really helped.",1397520000,,1175,4.676328502415459
