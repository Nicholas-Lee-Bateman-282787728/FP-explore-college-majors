1172331,1,8901732319,"From start to finnish this direct-to-video film is truly awful with terrible direction, amatuer filmaking sensibility , weak scripting and lousy acting by billed stars Gary Busey,Howie Mandel & Margot Kidder not to mention rest of co involved. Busey's character Tom Canoboro is a chapter of accidents as a deadly earnest cop clumsily endeavouring to foil Satan(Nick Mancuso, whose debauched glee is ironically the only bright spark)in his attempted global dominance. Ensemble cast quote unconvincingly from the Good Book, but not even the Second Coming would resurrect such disordered rubbish.

Jake Busey was good in ""Starship Troopers"" we watch the movie on Clearplay dvd player that filters out the nudity, sex in most movies.

Pros: Gary Busey, Howie Mandel, the lady actor in Superman (as Lois) and the plot was very good for me.

Christian scripture reduced to men in druid cloaks, Ouija boards and Anton LaVey lookalikes with cue ball heads and goatees.  How imaginative.

And then, the VR helmet thing.  That was REALLY what made me believe this movie was made to make Christian beliefs look like Saturday morning cartoons.  And the antichrist world ruler in charge of the global empire talking to people through the television set like a self-help guru.  You've GOT to be kidding.

If I were Bill Maher making his anti-religion movie ""Religulous"", I would have included snippets of this stinker to illustrate just how crazy, paranoid and juvenile Christian beliefs about the end of the world are.

1172367,5,8901732319,"This movie had some big name actors in it. I thought Sherry Miller, whom I had never heard of, and Howie Mandell, whom I have watched on The X Factor but didn't realize he was an actor, turned in the best performance. The story overlapped with Revelation, film two in this four part saga, which I watched earlier today, so it is very fresh in my mind. This one just didn't give me the same feeling. There were a few unexplainable through logic things that occur, but with God we can attribute those to His providence. Just like He took care of the Hebrews in battles with superior opponents, He will have a part in protecting at least some of His people during the tribulation. The 666 image on the hand was a bit behind the times. I've always suspected that the reference to this number involved bar codes consisting of 6-6-6 digits. That mark would enable people to be identified - even at a distance if that mark involves a radio frequency chip. The technology is available - and events seem to be lining up that would support a mandated insertion of these chips. This movie may be revealing the future. Let him who has ears to hear, hear.

The acting was better in this movie of the series than the first two. That may be because there were real actors hired for this film. You do not need to have seen the previous movies to enjoy this movie. Though it would aid in understanding more about the supporting characters in this movie.

In this movie we follow police detective played by Gary Busey and his family. The timeline starts before the rapture where our detective ends up in a coma. He awakens two years later to a changed world where a self-proclaimed Messiah is ruling a world at peace. Well that is if you do not take into the account the resistance groups of Christians.

Busey's charter learns that millions have disappeared, including his sister, and no one seems to remember they ever existed. As he tries to figure out what is transpiring he searches for his family. He has trouble accomplishing daily task in his search as he learns you must have the mark of the beast in order to do or buy anything. And once again the Virtual Reality theme is back in this film.

1172375,4,8901732319,"Hi, I saw the movie at my church about 6 years ago and enjoyed it.  Granted, it could be better but see if you can get the point of the story.  We know movies are expected to be well done so it's worth the cost of admission to see, but never mind this due to what the movie is about.  I cannot say enough how really, extremely important this movie is.

I was about to watch it again with my girlfriend at her home on DVD, but it didn't seem to be closed captioned at all.  I didn't even think to check for subtitles as that was before I got familiar with how DVDs work, etc.  Anyway, I'd like to know if this movie is indeed closed captioned, so is it??

To find out, assuming your TV isn't more than 14 years old, see if you can enable closed captioning somewhere on the menu, then play your copy and see if the captions appear, usually white text on black background.  If you see it, then the answer to my question is yes.  I'd like to order a copy if it is, so thank you in advance for your help with this matter.

Continues the sci-fi/virtual reality angle that was set up in the previous installment (""Revelation"") with a much heavier emphasis on horror/supernatural warfare (which the inexperienced will probably find offensive).

I actually enjoyed this one -- although some of the situations didn't ring true for me (eg. the Antichrist's reaction to the last Hater ""uplink"") & the post-rapture world seemed a little too out-dated & hokey (who uses payphones any more?!) ...

But it's always interesting to me to see how Helen Hannah (played by Leigh Lewis) gets ""woven"" in & out of the storyline time & time again, even though she's not the star ... Her character is a little on the one-dimensional side (SOOOOPER-SAINT!), but likeable nonetheless.",1167523200,4,822,5.172932330827067
1172378,1,8901732319,"I can't believe Sony would have anything to do with this dreck. Yes I watched the entire movie, and it felt like it was four hours long. I don't know where to start, in describing this film's lameness. I kept hoping for some unintentional laughs, but they were only to be found in the occasional action scene in which Gary Busey had to move his enormous gut from one side of the set to the other. Howie Mandel manages to remember all his lines and avoid touching any of the other characters, so his germ-phobia was probably not too much of a factor, but he has little or no screen presence in his role. Margot Kidder manages to say all her lines without her dentures falling out, but the lines she is given to say are pretty stale. Nick Mancuso is a standout here, simply because he looks cool and has a strong screen presence, but it is not enough to save the movie. One gets the feeling that the Biblical message (or rather Bible-believer agenda) came first, and the screenplay was cobbled together to try to convey it. This is always a recipe for a ponderous film experience, unless the film is The Ten Commandments, or the story of Jesus' life or something directly from the Bible. Oh, and by the way, this movie was funded by fundies.. televangelists in fact. So even if you are not the type who would give donations directly to some shady TV preacher, by buying this DVD, you are putting some of the money into their pockets.

I think Margot Kidder is quite a trooper; she's been thru a lot since her Superman the Movie days, and every bit of it shows on her face.  I really think she's a good person, and I would like to meet her someday if I ever get the opportunity.(yea, right, like that'll happen!)  The one thing that cracks me up about this flick, tho, is even after waking up after at least a year long coma, Gary's character has got very long shaggy hair, and matching beard, but he didn't lose one ounce of that excessive belly fat!

However, this film had one very hokey part which brought the quality of the film down a lot. So the ""image of the beast"" is a virtual reality helmet. What in the blue hell were the script writers smoking when they dreamt that up, even when they dreamt it up in the movie's prequel, ""Revelations""? How does a VR helmet burn a 666 on somebody's hand? How does a VR helmet cause a snakebite to appear on somebody in the real world? The whole VR helmet thing was really ill-conceived...okay, the VR helmet thing was STUPID.",1154131200,4,697,4.4453125
1172381,2,8901732319,"After a horrible first film ""Apocalypse"", a slightly better (yet still below average) second film ""Apocalypse 2: Revelation"", mostly Christian moviegoers (I should say movie renters, since none of these movies made it to theaters) were treated to yet another below average sequel in the 'Apocalypse' franchise.  Before I get into the story elements for this film, ""Apocalypse 3: Tribulation"", let me say to those who may be wondering why I continued with this series even though I hated it.  The reason is because I worked at a Christian retail store that stocked these films and they wanted people to watch them, and hopefully recommend them (though after viewing the movies there was no way I was recommending anyone to watch them).

""Apocalypse 3: Tribulation"" takes place at the same exact period of time as the previous installments.  First there is the rapture, after that those who were non-believers are left behind to either choose to follow God or the Antichrist.  Those who choose wisely, and follow God, are summarily punished and executed by the forces of the Antichrist in his quest for total world domination.

Why did the Lalonde brothers, who own Cloud Ten Pictures, choose to release yet another movie in this franchise and still have it go no further than the previous installments is beyond me.  I will give the writers some credit this time around, for one thing they have improved the quality of writing and they chose to have the main character (Gary Busey) awaken from a coma to discover the world had changed.  The most interesting thing about this addition to the story is that the control of the Antichrist is shown to a much stronger degree, by having the main character's brother (Howie Mandel) not even remember their own sister (Margot Kidder), who was a Christian and raptured away to be with God.  Even with this improvement the story still felt old and stale, mostly because the first two films dealt with the same topic, a way to improve this franchise beyond hiring better talent (which Cloud Ten has achieved here), is to actually further the storyline beyond the same period of time during the tribulation as the previous installments.  Some advancement would actually make this series a little more interesting, still not watchable by any means, but at least it wouldn't be the same old thing.

For those that actually liked this movie, and this franchise in general, you probably all disagree with me and think that I could not have possibly been watching the same movie as you.  Well, go ahead and think those foolish thoughts, because this franchise is a stinker, and anyone who has any taste in movies knows it.  As a Christian, I find this franchise to be stupidly written, directed, and produced, and an insult to the seriousness of the source material (Book of Revelation from the Bible).

If you did like this series or are at least remotely interested in further adventures from the end of days, then you're in luck as Cloud Ten Pictures actually made a fourth film called ""Apocalypse 4: Judgment"".

""Apocalypse 3: Tribulation"" is rated PG-13 for violence.",1122336000,7,3104,4.8745247148288975

This is a low-budget, lame script, cliche-ridden rehash of the old evil-UN, rapture, one-world-government stuff from Channel 23.

The minimal efforts to portray the future are only topped for awfulness by a hideously syrupy soundtrack.

Nick Mancuso makes a great anti-Christ but I can't think of another good acting job or indeed any good thing about this turkey.  ""Left Behind"" is a WAY better movie bet on the same subject!",1108598400,7,623,4.951923076923077
1172383,5,8901732319,"I was extremely unsure of seeing the new end times thriller critics raved about called Tribulation. Other than Gary Busey, who I knew as Buddy Holly in his younger years, I knew none of the other cast except for Leigh Lewis who I had seen in the previous two films in the Apocalypse series, both very good.

After seeing Tribulation, I immediately went out and bought the DVD along with the next movie in line, Judgment, which I will also be writing a review for. Tribulation is one of the greatest end times movies there is, as it provides in whatever state you are, in whatever position you're in, you can be taken in the Rapture, or be left behind. It's your choice which.

Top policeman Tom Canboro (Gary Busey) is on a seemingly normal night drive, when his car suddenly and mysteriously malfunctions sending him careening into oncoming traffic, plowing right into a big rig, sending poor Tom into temporary oblivian. After waking up 1 1/2 years later to find himself a different looking man, he realizes he's not the only one to undergo a strange change.

The world that he once knew is flipped upside down. Everyone seems to be supporting a new world leader named Franco Macalousso, and his strange looking new mark which is just a plain 666. As strange as this may seem, people that had once existed before Tom had his accident are nowhere in town, and the people that are still left don't remember anything that these people ever existed. Even his own brother who took the mark doesn't remember anything about their sister Eileen (Margot Kidder) who was a Christian. Guess Tom will just have to trust in someone else than his own family.

You won't understand a thing about a lot of the characters in this film until you see the other two Apocalypse, and Revelation. It's all worth it though. They give you some great insight to the Tribulation, and also provide some good entertainment. Take it from a Christian.",1094256000,12,1922,4.644117647058824

It doesn't take too much to entertain me; a good storyline and decent acting will do. Well, I made myself (and my poor husband) suffer through it just because I like to finish what I start, but it was a waste of time and money.
Don't get me wrong. I am a Christian AND love the whole Revelation-Apocaliptic genre, and even with that in favor of the movie I feel it was terrible all around. Bad Cast, bad acting, cheap production.

Intense dialogue--emotionally and theologically.  The discussions are powerful, and should most useful for church groups, Bible studies, and other spiritually oriented audiences. These characters are passionate and earnest--so much so, that  viewers will either become engrossed or wearied, depending on their openness to the premise.
One storyline idea that seems odd is that a virtual reality game piece would become the primary means of garnering the public's allegiance to a government and its leader.  In a genre that is part science fiction, the means is possible.  However, it seemed strange that people were making a decision of great import by choosing to participate in what seemed to be a high tech video game.
Nevertheless, the bottom line is that this is an intriguing, dramatic story well worth viewing.",1036886400,4,831,5.2727272727272725
1172387,5,8901732319,It is so amazing to watch the production company Cloud Ten Pictures grow and mature with each movie they release.  Hollywood take notice!  Christians no longer have to suffer through the garbage that Hollywood puts out!  Cloud Ten Pictures has become a true production company with great talent on board and a touch that no studio in Hollywood could match!  Look out!  Cloud Ten is coming up!  This movie only just shows the growth and maturity that has happened at Cloud Ten Pictures!,1031788800,4,485,4.783132530120482
1172388,5,8901732319,"This third film of the Apocalypse series begins before the Rapture (before ""Apocalpyse"") and ends after the receiving of the mark (after ""Revelation"").  Gary Busey plays a plain-clothes police officer who goes into a coma before the Rapture and awakens to a world vastly different.  His search for answers about what has happened to the world parallels his search for spiritual answers.
In the previous films of this series, the characters tried to understand the Rapture through theories of rationalism and alien intervention.  This film concerns more of psychic powers, crystals, and cabals.  Unlike the others, here these are treated as if these things do exist.  The key issue for the heroes deals more with choice than with faith.
This is a good movie, and I would recommend watching this.",1023926400,,794,5.076923076923077
1172389,3,8901732319,"This should've been a better movie. Unfortunately, some of the main characters were not at their best but great performances were given by Sherri Miller (Busey's wife) and Howie Mandel (who knew!). This movie doesn't really advance the series but just seems to be a few months ahead of where Revelation left off and deals with basically the same material except that it's happening to a new set of players on grander sets with better special effects. Overall, a little above average but still a notch below mainstream video fare-- hopefully this is just growing pains for the industry. I'd love to give 5 stars just for the fact that they've tackled this subject matter but I don't think these films are at that level...yet. -- Moza",1016755200,,732,4.771653543307087
1172390,5,8901732319,"Ive watched this movie over and over and each time I watch it I find something I missed the other times I watched it. It can really make you think on what is to come and how we may reacted to such things. If you have ever picked up the bible and read the parts dealt with in this movie then you can get an idea, but you have to have an open mind inorder to grasp what this movie is getting at in my opinion.",1001203200,,407,3.744186046511628
1172391,3,8901732319,"I accepted Jesus Christ as my Saviour in 1986 and since then I have been interested in the book of Revelation.  I have heard different interpretations of what will happen in the Rapture and tribulation period, and I think it will be very different from what was depicted in this movie.  I think the Anti-Christ will be more normal and human and subtle than he was depicted in this video.  Some things that were very good about the movie were the wonderful acting by Gary Busey.  Especially near the end.  He really got into the character.  Another good thing was the message that having a relationship with our creator, Jesus Christ is the most important goal and priority we should have. Some day soon everyone will realise that it is ALL that matters. I recommend you watch this series of videos and then read the book of Revelation...get a bible called The Message...it is really easy to understand, also read the book of Romans and John.  Most of all get to know Jesus, He`s real and waiting to hear from you : )  He is just a prayer away.",994723200,18,1043,4.481481481481482
1172392,4,8901732319,"Revelation is the best of the series to date (the jury is out until I see Judgement), but Tribulation was very good.  What may throw people off is that it starts in the time that Apocalypse did, but when Gary Busey wakes up, it's after the Rapture has occured and after Thorold Stone from Revelation has been executed.  Plus, the Tower of Babel prophecy will get all the Bible scholars in debate mode, not to mention the whole vitual image of the Beast motif.  What we all need to keep in mind is this a movie, a fictional plot based on a Biblical prophecy which has yet to come to pass.  The only way to find out what will happen after the Rapture (for those who don't know, this is an event in the Bible where Jesus Christ will come back for  all those who accepted Him as their Lord and Savior, at which time they will literally vanish from this earth to live forever in Heaven with Jesus.  This will occur before the Antichrist - a man possessed by Satan - will rise up as the political, financial, and spiritual ruler over the entire earth and claim that he is God.) is if you're still here when it happens.  I assure you, that is something you don't want!  That is the whole point of the series: to encourage people to come to Jesus Christ for salvation so that they won't have to experience the worst time period the world will ever know. I suggest getting the whole series, because, like the Star Wars trilogy, each movie feeds off the one before it. One might get confused about some holes in the plot if they don't see it in order.  But all in all, Tribulation is a must-see.",986860800,7,1585,4.291946308724833
1172393,1,8901732319,"Poorly written, poorly directed and poorly acted.
I was hoping for something more, and this movie did not have it.  Extremely low-budgeted and it shows.  A person wakes from a coma, then goes on the run immediately.  Don't think so.
Remember the sign of the Antichrist will not be able to be duplicated, a plain branded of 666 is too plain and I would think people would see right through it.
The first convert is extremely stupid, as a guy with his arm in his shirt is suddenly given his arm back.",984528000,13,498,4.391304347826087
1172394,5,8901732319,"Another great Christian film from Clud Ten Pictures, the same company that has released great films like APOCALYPSE, REVELATION, JUDGEMENT, and LEFT BEHIND-THE MOVIE. This film, the third in the acclaimed APOCLAYPSE movie series, is a great piece of mainstream entertainment. Gary Busey gives his best performance in this film, and so does Margot Kidder and Howie Mandel. Nick Mancuso is evil as always as Franco Macalusso, the Anti-Christ. The story line and plot are the most interesting that I've seen in years. It was like watching THE FUGITIVE mixed in with STAR WARS and THE OMEN, but, at the same time, had originality to it. If you're in to Apocalyptic thrillers like APOCALYPSE, REVELATION, LEFT BEHIND-THE MOVIE, JUDGEMENT, and THE OMEGA CODE, then this movie is for you. Prepare for Enlightenment!

1172395,5,8901732319,"I loved this movie!!  It's really great, and I was glad to see such bigname actors as Gary Busey and Howie Mandel in it.  The acting was great, and the suspense and the story were super-cool!  What gets me is why everybody has the Mark of the Beast on their hand and nobody has it on their forehead.  Not that I'd ever take it, no sir; it's just that the prophecy says that the Mark of the Beast can go on the forehead as well as the right hand.  Other than that I loved the movie.  Even if you don't believe in this stuff, you'll love it anyway.  This film is even better than all the Left Behind books put together (no joke)!!!!!!  Eschatology has always fascinated me, be it the Christian vision of the Second Coming/Armageddon or the Norse myth's vision of Ragnarok.  So it's only natural that I would like a movie such as this.  I used to believe in this stuff, but nowadays I question whether the book of Revelation is to be taken literally.  Still, I liked the movie.  Nick Mancuso as  the Antichrist was superb! Franco Macalousso has Damien Thorne and Nicolae Carpathia beat!  And as someone who has recently regained his faith, I can identify with Gary Busey's character, especially at the end of the film.",981072000,18,1215,4.414414414414415
1172396,2,8901732319,"...the ""prophecy"" referring to the People Of Babel (Gen. 11:6) will in actuality have no part whatsoever in the actual Tribulation. And the fact that this whole movie was based around it being an actual prophecy that was eventually to come to pass really was a disappointment to me.
The film gets 2 stars because, I'll admit, although the script was badly written, the acting was good, and the first half hour was quite intriguing until I found out what the whole plot of the movie revolved around.
The real reason I think some people don't like it (as do I) is that these Christians are proposing that this prophecy will be true which will mislead any Non-Christian viewers of the movie into believing that it will happen. And because of that, I feel that this movie (as entertaining as it may be) should not be taken as a literal or accurate depiction of what the Tribulation will bring to the earth.",979689600,8,902,4.574074074074074
1172397,5,8901732319,"I haven't actually seen this film yet.  I caught the trailer for it on the Left Behind film (which was also a terrific effort from Cloud Ten) and was intrigued, but especially by what I consider to be the most important actor in the film - Gary Busey.  Anyone who has heard Gary's testimony would appreciate seeing him in a Christian film.  Anyone who has not should watch TBN or poke around on the Net to see if you can find it.  It truly is a great example of God's ability to save the lost.  I'm going to buy this movie, and I'll follow up with a review after I actually watch it.",978912000,2,583,4.123893805309734
1172398,4,8901732319,"This movie by the makers of Left Behind far exceeded my expectations.  I thought this movie was excellent.  Unlike some reviewers I felt the acting was at least pretty good and for the most part very good.  I was a little worried that I would not be able to follow the movie because I haven't seen Apocalypse or Revelation, but that was not the case.  There were times when things got slightly confusing, mostly due to the complex nature of the film.  Having some knowledge of end times prophesy is helpful but not necessary to enjoy this film.  As a Christian I feel it is important for me to support Christian movies.  I was not at all dissapointed by my decision to purchase this DVD.  If you are a Christian you must see this movie.  If you are not a Christian but would like to see a clean movie (there is some violence) without nudity or bad language then I highly recommend this movie.",977788800,18,892,4.390243902439025
