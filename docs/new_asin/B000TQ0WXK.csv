2907683,5,B000TQ0WXK,"I purchased the Advanced Zumba DVD. I thought the DVD was very good, well put together....I already started using it.",1234483200,,117,4.9
2907684,2,B000TQ0WXK,This is a dvd focused on watching barbie type women shake what their mamma gave them which is great and all but i would rather excercise. some real people doing zumba and having fun with some instruction would be great.,1219449600,2,219,4.5
2907685,4,B000TQ0WXK,"I already have owned the old Zumba from 2002 that had Giselle Roque de Escobar who was very sweet & great timing/instruction as well as Beto who is here & Natalie. The 2002 had 60 min of instruction with Giselles's clear English & great analogies. The 30 min beginners & 60 min advanced had additional great dancers & 3 person ""percussion band"" with the great music that demands you move. The quick 20 min Rapido had just jumping around of Beto doing different steps & some regular aerobics mixed in & literally just jumping around like a maniac. I LOVED that set, everyone was a great fluid dancer, were having fun, non-stop aerobics pace, great music & Giselle made learning SO easy & not intimidating at all & have played the beginner & advanced so many times, I know everything down pat to the millisecond.
This 2004 version doesn't have Giselle, but the production feel, style & great music is still the same.
Beginners (learning the steps) - is only 18 min long, has Beto first teaching in Spanish then Natalie w/clear English translating 20 seconds later & with my limited Spanish classes, I could tell she would leave out some of the instruction. The instruction is limited, but they go very slow at first so you can learn pretty easily by watching, then they go full speed after and only on one side unlike the 2002 version. It's still good. They teach 3 styles of Merengue, 3 salsa, 1 samba, 2 reggaeton, 3 styels flamenco & 2 styles cumbia.
Abs, Butt & Thighs - 30 min Great music, has Natalie teaching in English w/Beto translating in Spanish. Starts with stretching, side leg lifts, on arms/knees leg lifts, bridge pose for butt/thighs, crunches, pilates single/double leg stretch, crunch with hand touching opposite knee for obliques, what Natalie called a yoga bridge but is really plank on the elbows & ends with laying down & a upward dog stretch. It is very boring, Natalie doesn't want to really work, but at least gets into the exercise when she's doing it for her own benefit. Beto acts like a child whining he doesn't want to do it, is tired, asking if it's over yet, groaning.  I don't expect or want over cheerfulness, just at least positive encouragement. If you have one person acting like the average person who doesn't want to work out, the other one has to be cheerful to compensate or at least remind you why you're working out, the benefits, etc. to keep you motivated. You won't find that here.
Power/Rapido - I'm not sure why it's called this since it's not short/there's no warm up, but it goes on for 42 min w/a 3 min cool down/stretch. It has Beto instructing in Spanish, Jenny with clear English translating immediately well, Natalie & several women & one guy all dancing. The music as always is good & they use all the steps you learn from the beginners & several more that they teach 1/2 speed a few times. Right after is a 10 min children's section with dancing full speed of over 8 kids dancing in front & Beto, Natalie, Jenny & a guy dancing in back. The kids are great dancers as well.
Advanced - Good music, Beto with Natalie translating & 2 guys & about 3 other girls dancing. 40 min w/a 5 min cool down/stretch, using moves from the beginners learning & adds more steps doing them several times in 1/2 speed at first.
I had fun with this, not as fun w/o Giselle, but still good since it still has great music, great non-stop aerobics pace, great fluid dancers, etc. For those with two left feet, I suggest getting the original 2002 first.

2907686,5,B000TQ0WXK,"Although I have had this DVD for a while, I still love it! The steps are easy to learn and you really get a great workout. The music is motivating! The workout clothing and backdrops are a bit cheesy, however I hook up my surround sound and still have a great time!! Definitely worth the money... I think :)",1178841600,10,307,4.220338983050848
2907687,2,B000TQ0WXK,This is the older version of Zumba Advanced. The New version is much better. In this old version is ok but you get much less music and a much shorter workout. If you like Zumba you should definitely go for the Newer Advanced Zumba (green cover) It is worth it.,1296864000,2,260,4.22

2907689,5,B000TQ0WXK,"It was worth purchased, I really enjoy to use this type for exercise, forget time and all done.",1285891200,,95,4.333333333333333
2907690,3,B000TQ0WXK,"I'm a pretty regular gym goer,and I recently took my first Zumba class. I immediately loved it. The class was really up beat, full of fun moves, and by the end of class, I was drenched in sweat. My kind of work out.

I got home and decided to get a money friendly alternative. The video was fun, but I found myself constantly comparing my experience with the one I had in the live class. Of course, I had more fun with a teacher who was able to add in more recent moves and music.

This video I found to be a bit repetitive and boring at times. They were using the same move for what seemed like a few minutes as the head instructor would go play drums.  Other than that, the instructors were inspirational and always seemed to be having fun. Also, the moves were changed in each song so it continued to keep my interest. It's definitely a good alternative to paying for individual Zumba classes.",1283644800,16,896,4.289940828402367
2907691,4,B000TQ0WXK,"It is not the newest in Zumba, but I am very happy with my purchase",1278288000,,67,3.533333333333333
2907692,4,B000TQ0WXK,"It is fun!  You can alter it to what fits you best.  It is colorful.
You can be intense and burn lots of calories or just go through the movements and get used to the exercises.

The ONLY thing I didn't like on my particular VIDEO was the voiceover was not Beto's.

From what I understand, Zumba is a Brazilian slang word for 'fast.'",1274745600,2,333,4.15625
2907693,5,B000TQ0WXK,"This Zumba tape did not have a box cover, but was in perfect condition and although it is a more advanced routine, it is GREAT!",1274486400,,127,4.12
2907694,5,B000TQ0WXK,"The Zumba workout tape is the most fun anyone could have while ""exercising"". It not only works the entire body but is like going to a dance party.",1274140800,3,146,4.25
2907695,4,B000TQ0WXK,"I did a couple of Zumba classes at a local gym and like them so decided to have a video at home to do more for less money.  This is a little more complicated than the ones at the gym but I think I will be able to follow it after a few more times using it.  It's certainly not easy but a lot of fun and you really work up a good sweat.  It's a full 60 minutes, with about 40 minutes of dance and 20 minutes of toning and cool down.  If you don't know Zumba at all it will be difficult to follow.  It might help to get the basic one first and move up.  I may even buy the one that shows the basic steps and then move on to this one to get the good work out because they explain very little on this video.  I think they expect that you already know the moves.  The time goes really fast and you don't feel like you're working out, except for the sweating.",1271030400,48,852,3.774011299435028
2907696,5,B000TQ0WXK,"I absolutely love this Zumba.  All you want to do is Zumba.  It is fun, and easy to follow.  It gives you such a great fun filled workout.  It is one of the very best workout DVD's that I have tried.  For a good time, try Zumba.",1242086400,,228,3.765957446808511

8210324,4,B000TQ0WXK,its a shame this was a good video but i should have never bought it used . the tape broke and almost broke my vcr. all over it was faulty maybe got a month out of it. it had to go in the garbage such a shame.,1365811200,,208,3.4468085106382977
8210325,3,B000TQ0WXK,I enjoyed this DVD.  It is lots of fun and the time flew by b/c it was constantly changing and that is a good thing! I was wishing it was a bit more intense but it made working out fun.,1356220800,,185,3.625
8210326,3,B000TQ0WXK,"This is not a bad dvd. Beto only speaks spanish, so he has to have one of the ladies in his group translate everything. That is not that big a deal. I just found that zumba is not fun to do by yourself. If you have others and like to do it by dvd, then this one is ok, but if you have been to a class and are trying to capture that at home....not so much.",1335830400,2,355,3.6233766233766236
8210327,5,B000TQ0WXK,I purchased this for my wife last Christmas and she loves it - This DVD keeps her moving and sweating and motivated to lose weight and stay in shape. The DVD arrived new and wrapped in plastic - No visible scratches and plays perfectly.,1331596800,,236,4.386363636363637

8210329,2,B000TQ0WXK,"I thought this DVD was the same one I owned in VHS form.  It is not even though both are titled ""Advanced"" and have the same cover design.  I am disappointed in it.",1310428800,12,164,3.9393939393939394
8210330,5,B000TQ0WXK,I purchased this DVD to try some of the progam without purchasing the entire program.  I really enjoyed the DVD and working at my own pace at home.,1310083200,,147,4.25
