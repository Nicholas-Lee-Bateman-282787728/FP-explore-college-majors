8376170,3,B002OLV3IG,The first part of the video is very good and my son likes it and sings a long but after the first few minutes he tends to tune off (even I lost interest).  It might just be bettter for kids reaching the age of the 3 and above.  I think anything that is educational is good for our kids so it's definitely a good buy but there might be better ones out there.,1367798400,,357,3.8767123287671232
