8611951,5,B00F3LFQS2,"A very talented cast and clever storyline made this film an entertaining evening.  Star Clark Koelsch chews up every morsel of scenery.  He is a real hoot to watch as he transitions from male to female and he is definitely on the road to stardom.  First time director, Kate Cohen, did a marvelous job putting the pieces together and there isn't a bad apple in the entire cast -- even the extra's do a great job.  This movie is fun, clean and short, and I am recommending it to all of my friends.",1384300800,,495,4.290322580645161
