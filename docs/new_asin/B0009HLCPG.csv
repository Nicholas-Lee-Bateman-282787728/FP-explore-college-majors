2290835,4,B0009HLCPG,"This is for the VCI DVD-R release since Amazon does not have a listing for it.  The quality is all right, but eventually there are some dialogue interrupting splices.  It is also a re-issue since the end title says Library Films on it.  Have not seen the other releases to compare.
UPDATE:  Having now seen the Alpha release, I can actually recommend that one over the VCI.  The Alpha print has NO splices, NO Alpha logo, and the original Republic Pictures beginning and ending titles.  Good video and audio.",1329004800,,508,4.651685393258427
2290836,4,B0009HLCPG,"While I don't think this film is as good as ""Hellzapoppin' or ""Ghost Catchers,"" it is classic Ole Olsen and Chic Johnson.  It's a nice chunk of raucous, old time vaudeville and a merry romp of slapstick, complete with quick one-liners that can usually evoke a chuckle or two.  While I don't quite consider it as good as their other flicks, this one is okay, if you're into Olsen and Johnson.  I know I am.",1314835200,,405,4.373333333333333
2290837,2,B0009HLCPG,"It's tempting to give this 1937 comedy three stars, as it features Hal Roach-related players and (apparently) writers and directors, most notably James Finlayson, expertly playing a rattled radio show producer (""McDonald's Mackrels""), who witnesses the craziest audition in show business history, as Olson and Johnson, make several attempts at performing a classical piece for piano and violin - they pla live - but Olson's reliance on the law of averages does not score with the famous Scotsman.

Somehow, the failed audition *wins* them a show - but only if the finale will include the announcement of the killer of a reluctant financier.

The actual broadcast sequences are when the film really gets in gear and delivers some laughs. (If the viewer can get past an innocent man's murder as a plot element in a wild comedy). Although the film has alot of snappy patter and never slows down, it cannot be said that delivers much mirth, overall. The trained seal, ""Sally"", is a nice addition, but like much of the production, there's no LOL payoff, at all.",1310774400,,1056,4.926966292134831
2290838,4,B0009HLCPG,"FILM CLASSICS videotapes are good quality SP speed dubs that are stored in sturdy clamshell cases.

ALL OVER TOWN (1937) is an ideal introduction to the now forgotten vaudeville team of 'Ole' Olsen and 'Chic' Johnson.

It may actually be their best film, for in this one the boys project infinite comfort within their natural environment. The early part of the story occurs at a vaudevillian boarding house, surely the sort of place Chic and Ole knew well. Their joy seems genuine, and get ready for a surprise. These skilled musicians only became jokesters AFTER they teamed up in the 'Teens. Impressive musical abilities are especially evident in Mr. Johnson, who in one scene gives a virtuoso ad-lib piano performance, playing several lightning-fast runs with effortless precision.

The meshing of talent is so obvious, for John Olsen and Harold Johnson had been working closely together nearly a quarter-century when ""All Over Town"" was filmed. They play off each other perfectly, have the unison dialogue gimmick down pat and you can see so well that they relish their mutual company and are often amusing each other without trying. These men are a pleasure to watch!

As for other cast members, Franklin Pangborn has never seemed so fey as when his costumer lovingly describes a glitzy gown he'll fashion. You can just tell this guy wears his own dresses! Jimmy Finlayson is a bit past his Laurel & Hardy prime, but that dyspeptically squinty Scotsman routine still brings smiles. Jimmy is typecast as MacDougal, owner of a fish cannery and sponsor of the radio program that provides a setting for our BIG FINISH!

While the killer runs from cops within the studio and mayhem goes on during a live broadcast, Olsen describes all the action for listeners, as Johnson cheerily chips in with several ""brought to you through the courtesy of MacDougal's Mackerel"" plugs.

If you like breezy comedy as presented by genuine craftsmen, you cannot do better than Olsen & Johnson's ALL OVER TOWN. Highly recommended.",1286496000,2,2012,4.991044776119403

2290840,3,B0009HLCPG,"IF you are looking for another ""War and Peace"" film stop right now.  Olsen and Johnson are two show biz vaudeville guys that manage to get kicked out of their actors boarding house because of their musical seal act!  Off they go looking for an old friend that runs a theater.  Mistaken for millionaires, their new show runs strictly on speculation.

Wise cracks fly and murder occurs with it all coming down to O&J having to solve the mystery.  The transfer is not the best but the film gives some insights as to comedy at the time,  Still it's fun and light hearted.",1243987200,6,567,4.456310679611651
8060969,3,B0009HLCPG,"Olsen and Johnson were leftovers from vaudeville and did slapstick from that era. BUT they had a hard time trying to play it straight and laughed at their jokes and situations when filming, much to the dismay of their director who couldn't control them. They helped the country to laugh while WW2 was going on and entertained the troops overseas where they could. They did a film with Martha Ray who became the sweetheart of the troops also.
Although it was corny, they made very little money and just a few more films but helped pull the nation up when it was most needed.",1468627200,,573,4.519230769230769

8060972,2,B0009HLCPG,"This is no Hellzapoppin - short on plot and O & J craziness both.  Not that you want much of a plot with  O & J, just a cheap budget movie.",1402790400,,139,3.4516129032258065
8060973,4,B0009HLCPG,"I had never seen this movie. And I have to say, it was slow going at first; but, the last quarter (especially the end), I was doubled over in laughter with tears rolling down my eyes. So, my review is based on me rolling on the floor toward the end.

I remember the older folks (those around 70 in the 1970s-80s), loved that humor and most knew of Olsen and Johnson. Even 80 seems too young, nowadays, to know who they were much less to appreciate their brand of humor [it runs in the family].

My bias: I was watching the film with my Mom (19 and 20 years younger than her two surviving older siblings), who was the youngest child of John S. Olsen and Lillian Clem (he was my grandfather, but died when I was 6 months old). They once had a kitten for a gag (broadway), and low and behold, when the time came -- my Mom (a little girl) ended up being in the audience with the kitten...

8060975,1,B0009HLCPG,"Olsen & Johnson's film ""Hellzapoppin"" is one of my favorites, and I enjoyed their TV programs very much, so I was looking forward to seeing this film, made a few years before ""Hellzapoppin."" The humor is incredibly weak, all the way through. Olsen and Johnson fans will want to see it, though, I'm sure, so go to YouTube - you can see the whole film now on YouTube.",1383350400,,365,4.382352941176471
8060976,5,B0009HLCPG,"This is another great movie, staring Ole Olson and Chic Johnson. This movie, along with Country Gentleman, and Hellsapoppin, are some of the best comedies that America has ever made. Thumbs up on all three!",1376697600,,206,4.914285714285715
