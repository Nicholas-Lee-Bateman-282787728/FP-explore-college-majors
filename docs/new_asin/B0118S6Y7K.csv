7330272,5,B0118S6Y7K,"I just watched Louise Green do an interview online.  She's very inspiring and encouraging, and very body positive.  This is one video I'm sure I won't have to feel at a loss for not measuring up.  I look forward to starting to get fit, and can't wait to receive it!",1464825600,2,265,4.26
7330273,1,B0118S6Y7K,"I tried two computer DVD drives, but it will not play in either one.  I was able to workout to Debbie Mack's - Cardio Kick using the same computer drives, but not this one. I don't want to give it one star, but...for $18.99 it should PLAY!",1463443200,4,239,4.085106382978723
7330274,5,B0118S6Y7K,4 different women to follow all at different levels. A person can follow the woman seated and work up to the follow the woman that is jumping around. Very good.,1457395200,12,160,4.366666666666666
8723861,5,B0118S6Y7K,Everything came as expected.  I love this workout video.  It's perfect for those of us who want to start including physical activity and exercise but have issues that prevent us from using most out on the market.  I have ankle (broken both multiple times) and knee (likes to pop out of place) issues that have been an issue when I try to do anything new but this is perfect as a starting point for me to exercise with these issues in mind and with the added pounds that have come as a result over the years.  I would highly recommend for anyone who is on the heavier side and has had problems finding a workout that will accommodate those with a less than perfect body that seems to fight them to do workouts.,1531180800,3,709,4.30827067669173
8723862,5,B0118S6Y7K,Quick ship and just as advertised.  Thank you,1529020800,,45,4.625
8723863,5,B0118S6Y7K,Paced very well for the heavy woman.  Before you know it you've finished the workout--no dreading for the next time.,1528416000,,116,4.8
8723864,5,B0118S6Y7K,"This is PERFECT for us larger girls starting out exercising.  I love how they show the modifications.  There is a girl going faster, one going slower,  one exercising in a chair, and Louise makes it fun.  Much easier to start with than the Debbie Mack Plus Size workout dvd.",1521158400,3,274,4.530612244897959
8723865,5,B0118S6Y7K,This is an excellent video and you do not have to be overweight to benefit.  I am a. Senior and love this workout.  Plus size is not always. Overweight but bigger in size.  I cannot find any more information on line and would like more information if anyone can help.  I got this at the library but am definitely buying it today.,1516579200,,329,4.258064516129032
8723866,4,B0118S6Y7K,I really like that they show different intensities so you can follow along at your own pace,1500336000,3,91,4.411764705882353
8723867,5,B0118S6Y7K,"A DVD I can finally actually do. It really works my achy old body and let's me know I did something other than watch the screen, wishing I was able to participate. This DVD is full of upbeat moves and music, which keeps it interesting. I recommend it for others like me who cannot keep up with Jane Fonda.",1498694400,15,305,4.186440677966102
8723868,4,B0118S6Y7K,Good for individuals who are just starting out.,1492646400,4,47,5.0
8723869,5,B0118S6Y7K,Louise gives good instruction and the she has a lot of different difficulty levels to watch during the workout. It is good because it goes between weights and cardio:),1489190400,4,167,4.793103448275862
