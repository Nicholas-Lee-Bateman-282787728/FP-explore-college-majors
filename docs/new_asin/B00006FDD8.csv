7967767,4,B00006FDD8,"This DVD includes songs from all her albums from Mujer de Fuego (her second album) through 2001's Yo Por Ti.  It is quite fun to see how she has changed her look over time, going from Spanish Senora to hip modern chick. Even within a given time frame, Olga is a real chameleon, looking almost like a different person in each video.

It isn't just in her appearance that Olga is so versatile. She has the ability to significantly alter the timber and style of her singing voice in a way that actually only a minority of singers can do. She is husky and deep and very Spanish in Entre la noche.. and Llego el Amor. Lyrical, light and lovely in Me Subes. She sings with great restraint and subtely in Vendras llorando. And tremendously forceful and imposing  in Hielo y Fuego.

The older videos are really the most entertaining. In Entre La Noche y el Dia and Llego el Amor Olga is very much the Latin Diva and is just great with her humorous expressions and toying attitude with the camera. Vendras Llorando is very cute and funny. Olga has never looked more gorgeous than in Me Subes Me Bajas Me Subes, plus we are treted to some fantastic looking male dancers in this video. Basta Ya is just OK, but again, a great looking guy. Presecie tu Amor isn't too great, it looks almost like a home video. Hiego y Fuego is good, with some hot men to look at once again.  Tu Amor is similar but not as good.

Also included is Ya me Canse from the Viva Olga DVD recorded at the House of Blues. This provides a nice contrast, and we get to see what great stage presence and humor Olga delivers.

Then there are the two newer numbers. Mientame is a lovely song, but is inexplicably given a hip hop/break dance treatment which I don't like at all, and Olga looks awful. Como Olvidar is presented in both merengue and ballad versions. Good video and a hot guy help, but I sure don't care for the new Hip Olga look. She looks positively hideous in the merengue Como Olivdiar with the blond streaked hair, ugly clothes, and sparkle makeup. And i hope some of the other apparent appearance changes are not from any plastic surgery. She does, however, deliver some great dance steps.

It would have been nice if this video had a slicker layout, better transitions and more bonus features.

Having been a fan of Olga for several years, it was a real treat to see this video - if you are an Olga Tanon fan, you can't help but enjoy this. I have considered her to be one of the best singers out there, and now I see what a great performer she is as well.",1114819200,,2532,4.324894514767933
7967768,3,B00006FDD8,"It doesn't get much better than Olga ... She is hot hot hot and her voice just seems to keep on giving ....

What I didn't like as the quality of the DVD .... even though they are videos of some of her latest releases most of them are older than dirt and so is the quality of the sound ....

Sorry  I sure had better hopes",1096070400,4,322,3.7761194029850746
