1779610,5,B00006JDSJ,"This movie gives incredible insight into the way people lived in Poland during the 50 year Russian occupation.

In his book Revolution from Abroad (Princeton Univ. Press, 1st ed., p. 229)  Princeton Professor Jan Tomasz Gross wrote of the Soviet and Nazi occupations of Poland:""These very conservative estimates show that the Soviets killed or drove to their deaths three or four times as many people as the Nazis from a population half the size of that under German jurisdiction. This comparison holds for the first two years of the Second World War, the period before the Nazis began systematic mass annihilation of the Jewish population."" Gross shows that, for Polish Christians, the Soviets were even worse, indeed much worse than the brutal Nazis. Essentially all the Polish professional and semiprofessional classes (doctors, lawyers, teachers, engineers, managers, foremen, farmers with holding beyond a few acres, etc.)  were rounded up by the Soviets and then either killed immediately or retained in prisons for shipments to slave labor camps in Siberia and Central Asia.  Prison conditions were hellish, worse than those  in the Nazi concentration camps. What of those who survived the war?Zanussi shows the beginnings of the lives people lived who actually did survive the war to begin a 45 year jouney through what can only be described as circles of Hell. In 1945, the war ended for America. Poland endured an additonal 45 years of occupation worse than that of the Nazis. Difficult for us to understand the suffering of these brave people, but Zanussi brings us to the point where we can see it, taste it, and smell it.",1179360000,5,1634,5.059479553903346
1779611,4,B00006JDSJ,"Krzysztof Zanussi's ""A Year of the Quiet Sun"" (1984) is a wonderful and unforgettable film. Zanussi's name may not sound familiar but he is one of the finest Polish and European directors who inspired the whole new generation of Polish filmmakers, including Krzysztof Kieslowski and Agnieszka Holland. This film is a lost treasure - I never heard of it; there are only few users' comments about it on IMDb. I saw couple of earlier Zanussi's films (""The Structure of Crystal"" and ""The Constant Factor"") but they could not prepare me for this one, another Landscape After Battle, the simple and quiet story of love during the time of suffering. The year is 1946, the place - a small war- ravaged town that used to be a part of Germany but now is a part of Poland. The Polish widow, Emilia (Maya Komarowskaya in a performance so powerful, intense, subtle, and shining - she reminds me of Liv Ullmann in her best roles) meets an American soldier, Norman (Scott Wilson of ""In Cold Blood"") who involved in war-crimes investigation. Both their lives have been cruelly disrupted by the worst War of the 20th Century. Norman has seen so much suffering and death (he was a prisoner of war) - it is not easy for him to return home but he feels that the woman he met by chance and with whom he has no common language and can only communicate by gestures or rely on interpreters, could be his partner and friend for life. Emilia, who has lost her husband after only a few months of marriage and struggles to survive while taking care of her ailing mother, questions herself if it is even ""right"" for a human being to look for love and happiness. Slowly, these two begin to realize that no matter what you lived and you've been through, no matter how unbearable the past was and how uncertain the present is, love is possible.

I found myself so involved in the story that Zanussi and his actors told; I wished so much for the characters to find peace and happiness together but I knew that it was not an optimistic Hollywood romance I was watching. I knew that it was one of the best romance films I was watching. The camera work by Slawomir Idziak (Black Hawk Down (2001), Trois couleurs: Bleu (1993),La Double vie de Vronique(1991), and The Decalogue (1989) is above any praise as well as the original music by Wojciech Kilar (The Pianist (2002), Dracula (1992)).

The film ends with a fantasy scene that takes place in Monument Valley, where John Ford shot his ""Stagecoach"", the only American film that Emilia and her mother saw and they mentioned it to Norman. Scott Wilson remembers that Zanussi and the Andrei Tarkovsky visited Monument Valley on their way to the Telluride Film Festival in 1983.

From Roger Ebert's review: ""Both directors vowed to film there someday. Tarkovsky died before he could. Zanussi traveled to the valley with only his cameraman, his two stars, and Wilson's wife Heavenly as crew, and they filmed the ending, which is poetic in the way it visualizes the hope of the two lovers while reflecting the poignancy of their fates.""

1779612,5,B00006JDSJ,"This is a wonderful and carefully sculpted script on the nature of the art and impossible love. A Polish widow and an American Soldier joined and ironically separated for the invisible barriers of a bloody War: Affections, memories under Chopin 's music will allow us to establish an immediate link with that unforgettable gem of the late Forties: Jean Pierre Melville 's  The Silence of the sea.

A haunting and poignant portrait around the unsaid of the War' s legacy.

Maja Komorowska 's towering acting!",1140912000,4,507,4.9411764705882355
1779613,4,B00006JDSJ,"A Year of the Quiet Sun is a love story told in the bombed out remains of Poland just after World War II.  Scott Wilson is Norman, a private in the American Army who remains behind to take part in the investigation of war crimes.  He meets Emilia, a woman he notices painting a picture in a burnt out car.  He takes an interest in her and soon falls deeply in love with her and wants to marry her.  Emilia is played by Maya Komorowska, who is easily the best thing about this film.
If Komorowska is so good, and she is, why haven't we seen her more frequently?  The answer to this question comes in a special feature on the DVD.  In the mid 1980's when this film was being made, Poland was still under Soviet oppression.  Komorowska was a supporter of Solidarity, according to Scott Wilson, who tells us about the problems he faced working on this film with director Krsysztof Zanussi.  Few freedoms were available to the Polish people and the oppression they experienced delayed their recovery from the disaster of the Second World War.  Komorowska should have been a major star.  Fortunately we have A Year of the Quiet Sun to appreciate her great talent.
As good as the acting is in this film by all involved, the story moves at a snail's pace.  We are meant to feel the pain of Norman and Emilia as they attempt to find some happiness in a bombed out world of fear and poverty.  Emilia speaks only a little English and Norman speaks no Polish.  It takes time for them to figure out what each wants, which they do through nonverbal communication and occasional help from a translator.
Also, Zanussi wants us to see and feel the desperation of the people living in Poland just after the war.  He shows us more than he tells us and he takes his time as, for example, we watch Polish bodies being excavated from a mass grave.  Emilia's husband may be among the dead, although we are not certain of this.
What we are left with after two hours or so of watching this film is the experience of seeing the profound difference one good person can make in the lives of others.  Emilia refuses to allow herself and her life to be reduced to hatred and bitterness.  She buries the past and attempts to live nonjudgmentally in the present.  She seeks happiness, but not at the expense of her duty to her sick mother and to her friends, most notably a prostitute who is her neighbor.  Maya Komorowska brings Emilia to life so convincingly that we will not soon forget her or her story.",1059868800,23,2475,4.423841059602649
1779614,5,B00006JDSJ,"This was my husband's question halfway through this powerful film.  In 1946, an American officer (Scott Wilson, ""In Cold Blood"") comes to a devastated, formerly German part of Poland to investigate war crimes.  He befriends a displaced war widow (the superb Maja Komorowska) and her mother, despite their meager shared vocabulary.  Friendship blossoms into love.  But don't expect a lot of pretty scenes.  This film is somber, with a complete absence of special effects.  Light and color are doled out like postwar jam and coffee.  The closest it comes to laughs is the occasional guffaw of frustration at the variously hapless and feckless translators recruited to the lovers' cause.  Oh, and viewers of Polish background get a ticket for one chuckle of recognition at the portrait of the self-sacrificing mother. Also, there is no glamour-amid-the-ruins, absolutely none.  No, all elements of light entertainment are stripped away here.  The film's entire brilliance comes from Zanussi's script and direction, self-effacing yet dumbfounding art and camera work, the basis in history, and virtuoso ensemble acting.  The real sufferings endured by millions are the canvas on which this film is painted.  Somber, yes, but the story might really have happened; in fact, I have no doubt that some version of it really did happen, perhaps many times.  Zanussi's real subject is the bright flame of decency, strength and heroism on which civilized behavior depends.  I was a little worried about inflicting this movie on my husband after a hard day's work...would he doze off?  But I'd forgotten one thing since I first saw ""A Year of the Quiet Sun"" years ago as a first-run movie in New York:  the superb acting and the fragile communication between the main characters produce a sustained dramatic tension which will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Believe me, we both stayed wide-eyed.  Had enough of Hollywood?  Here's your movie.",1059782400,47,1933,5.118210862619808

Emilia has a heart of gold, pure gold. I think that Emilia was too obscure in not wanting to reveal all to Norman. What's the use of being so stoically independent when you have a good man who loves you? Emilia was just too damaged for true love. This movie was brilliant although painful to watch. Please don't watch it if you're feeling down. It was a good, sad movie. It's a reminder for us to carpe diem and not wallow in the past.",1432684800,2,610,4.267241379310345

1779697,5,B00006JDSJ,"Scott Wilson (Norman) is probably best known as a character actor, and Emelia, played by the great Polish actress Maja Komorowska -- most likely unknown to many Americans --  find love in the dismal aftermath of WWII in Poland. They do not look like the Hollywood ideal of a romantic pair, and this works in their favor. Because they are a new and unfamiliar couple, their love story is all the more real and engaging. Touching and bittersweet. A little levity is provided by hapless translators, and by Emelia's mother, (Hanna Skarzanka) the sentimental, would-be matchmaker. None of the subplots work quite as well as the central romance, but it is so memorable it carries the picture. A lovely story, beautifully acted.",1428710400,2,722,4.918032786885246
1779698,5,B00006JDSJ,"This is a lovely story of real people caught in the drama of a post WWII era, and how they strive to survive with intolerable conditions from day to day. The story is touching to see this polish widow, as she does her painting artwork among the ruins. She supports herself and her ill mother with her baking skills, as they live in a hovel left after war has taken it all. We see death and scenes of cruelty and the inhumanity of the armies and what happened to the men no longer there to protect their women. They mother and daughter subsist in the ashes as they survive the attacks of  unsavory characters who threaten their safety and sanity,

When a lonely yank is attracted to this hard working widow, the romance meets the problems of people of another language and customs. She is honest and decent, but her reality means she has little chance to survive or flourish. Under normal conditions, one might think the yank tries to take  advantage of her circumstances, but his loneliness and genuine kindness comes through in his dealings with her. He becomes her benefactor, one who treats her mother with respect and tries to protect them from the predators who would steal from them. We like him and wish it were easier for him to communicate with her. We see he has adopted a purpose to help and make life easier for them. He is a genuine nice guy and the actor is not an opportunist, but lonely and sad in his own way. He wins over the mother with his concern and good will.

The story strikes a chord with me. This reminds me of the frustration of attractions between people with different language and culture. So it was between my husband and I at the beginning. Some things don't need to be translated. There is that loneliness and desire to love and be loved, that transcends such a situation. In the story, the viewer wants this to be a ""happy ending"" for these star crossed lovers. The Yank wants to take this widow to safety with him, but she can't leave her ill mother. We see the deep love in the sacrifice made by the mother, that touches the viewers' heart. The mother realizes her daughter will not leave her. She knows her daughter has this one chance to find happiness with this kind American. She won't leave her mother and that means only with the mothers' death will this dutiful daughter leave with her American love. It is ironic that even with her mothers' sacrifice, the lovers are parted.

I found this story beautiful, and haunting. One wants to believe this couple will be reunited. We are happy the Yank keeps his promise to protect and care for this lady years later. He never forgot her and he gives her the gift of love at the end. We so want to see them reunited. I loved the film and would watch it again. It is a lovely story, and I highly recommend it to anyone who yearns for a good love story, or someone who lost one they cared about. The actors did a great job and the actress was perfect for her part. I thought this lady was luminous, even in her dim surroundings and grey tones.

1779725,4,B00006JDSJ,"I couldn't stop watching Scott Wilson in The Grissom Gang. Such unguarded intensity is quite unusual. He's older and less obsessive here, but still unsettlingly vulnerable. Komorowska [also in Wajda's masterful-horrific Katyn] is herself all raw nerve. The kind of woman whose purity compels reverence. A mythological matriarch and mater dolorosa, she possesses a quality of quiet intensity rare in an actress. Her depths are channeled without distortion to her surface, a bit like Julie Harris, only with the volume slightly lower and with less treble.

You don't get this kind of undiluted humanity in American films. It's unnerving because unpredictable. War can do that to a neighborhood. A Year of the Quiet Sun is a film made by and for adults. A deeply felt, atmospherically saturated work that tells the story of an improbable love. One that had no business coming about, and that even after becoming reality remains somehow otherworldly. A film authentic in the way Axel Corti's war trilogy ""Wohin und Zurck,"" also from the early 80s, is . They are all products of an era characterized by the actual experience of historical discontinuity, not just its filmic emplotment.

I did find the language barrier between the lovers almost too effective. We, as the audience, have an interest in characters being able to communicate, and anything that hinders it needs to subserve that interest. Granted, our frustration mirrors that of the characters and their incapacity is thematically warranted. The fact remains that it is in itself less interesting than communication, and only works if it is overcome. Here the language barrier seems to become a theme in its own right. But such incapacity is not itself very engrossing. A minor quibble.

I understand Zanussi succumbed to commercial interests eventually, but that this and some other films of his belong among the best Polish films of their era. All films too little known in the West.

The transfer is like the recording of an analogue tape, unfortunately. In other words, we don't have access to the actual surface of the film, to its texture, only to a bad and distorted copy thereof.",1344124800,6,2145,5.0508474576271185
