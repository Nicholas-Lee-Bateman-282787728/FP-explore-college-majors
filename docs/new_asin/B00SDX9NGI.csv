This is absolutely complete (unlike the Met version )",1503619200,,111,6.0

8698202,3,B00SDX9NGI,"First, the good. The music is beautiful, and this is a rare complete version of the work.

Now, the bad. The staging is one of those terrible regietheater productions. The opera is supposed to be set in ancient Babylon,  but the women are wearing 20th century cocktail dresses, the men some weird business uniforms and one woman looked like she was wearing some type of cossack uniform. The sets and costumes are minimalistic and have zero bearing to the story and add nothing to it.

5 stars for the music, negative stars for the production. I used the average of the 2 to get the 3 star rating. Get the CD version instead. You'll get the great music, but you won't have to watch it.",1455667200,7,684,4.456
8698203,4,B00SDX9NGI,"Semiramide is Rossini's last major opera seria aside from William Tell. It was premiered in 1823 at La Fenice in Venice, and was very well received.
Semiramide has been revived sporadically since then, a major obstacle being the need for big bel canto voices capable of both dramatic and coloratura singing. This is some of Rossini's greatest writing, and it's easy to be swept along by it.

The last commercial video was made at the MET in 1990, the one prior is from Aix-en-Provence, 1980, both of lesser technical quality.
That's why there has been anticipation since Dynamic announced this new Blu-Ray (and DVD) issue from Vlaamse Opera Antwerp/Ghent, conducted by Alberto Zedda, a veteran Rossini scholar and conductor.

The historical queen Semiramis ruled around 2000 BC Babylon,  the rich and powerful kingdom of Assyria.
After the restricted audio and video of the MET production, the quality of the new Blu-Ray is a blessing. Zedda (who is also the Director of the Pesaro Rossini Festival) leads a medium sized orchestra, and the singers are all excellent voices and experienced Rossinians, but in the 2010s we just don't have the big voices of the 1980/1990 era, and even then there were very few singers capable of top shelf Rossini.
This production uses some body microphones that are subtle and not visible. There is a minimal stage ambience and some directivity, the voices are cleanly recorded and set slightly behind the orchestra.
I was really wishing that Zeffirelli could have conjured up this production, as it would have really benefitted from some over-the-top palace opulence!
At 3 hours 58 minutes, some over-the-top settings and costumes would be welcome - and that's 20+ minutes longer than the MET, with comparable tempi. On the other hand, the opera is written in scenes, so it's easy to watch it in hour-long segments, and that's how many of us prefer to enjoy it.
The backdrops are fairly unobtrusive and the costumes are recent but from no specific period. At least the Royal characters should have had more elaborate costumes. Visuals can make a significant contribution to a production. The green case cover art comes from certain green costumes and green front projection light that is a distraction. Unfortunately when it comes time for ""Bel raggio lusinghier"" the projection is showing a distracting old movie clip behind her that is later acted out on stage, (but why?) that could have been shown later. There should have been an added featurette on what the director was wanting to communicate. One backdrop is a ruined palace ballroom in green sepia with what appears to be HVAC ducting...  At least there's no chrome hospital beds and machine guns.

But, the singing is the thing here, and these singers give a strong showing in their roles, all are well recorded and the disc is easy to access. Of the singers, the Arsace, Ann Hallenburg is excellent, but is less aggressive and more feminine than Horne. In some cases the stage action contradicts the libretto, and the ending stage action is unnecessarily botched.
This is the best way to see Semiramide; if you want to hear some glorious old-school vocalism, my choice is the old Decca CD set with Sutherland and Horne. They did also record some video excerpts in concert in the 1980s from Sydney, still in late prime voice.",1426896000,7,3318,4.928443649373882
