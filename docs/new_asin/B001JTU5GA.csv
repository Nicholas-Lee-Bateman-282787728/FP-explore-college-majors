8314050,5,B001JTU5GA,"Interesting story about a gang of pickpockets that have elevated the crime to nearly an art form. Despite crime being the centerpiece of the film, the movie overall has a good balance of lightheartedness and intensity. Its not at all formulaic like Hollywood movies tend to be; and youll never be certain where its going next. I found the movie enjoyable; and having been in the Causeway Bay area of Hong Kong where this was filmed, the familiar scenery made it even more so.
