6947739,5,B00S1VR6C0,"For the millions of fans who could not afford the original box sets of ""Bewitched"" when they came out years agao Sony is nicely offering the season sets at a new remarkable price. In this outing you get Season 5 and Season 6 of the greatest supernatural comedy ever yt thbroadcast. These seasons were very important years in the history of ""Bewitched"" as producers knew that Dick York (the original Darren) could not continue with the weekly series due to severe back pain. In Season 4 York had missed multiple episodes, so when the sixth season began and Dick York collapsed on the set producers knew he had to be replaced. In Season 6 another Dick came on, Dick Sargent, a more nice and calmer Darren. The sixth year saw a brand new opening with the same music, but the magic was missing. The chemistry between Elizabeth Montgomery and Sargent was nit evident and as a result ratings went down the toilet. Also as anyone in sitcom knows by the fifth year ideas run dry and ""Bewitched"" was no different. Old scripts from past seasons were reused but rewritten and the show lagged on.

 The price for these two seasons on DVD is remarkable! It is a great way to begin your collection of ""Bewitched"". For those of you who do not know there are NO special features which was the case in previous ""Bewitched"" DVD releases.",1422057600,12,1319,4.561181434599156

6947761,5,B00S1VR6C0,"Very happy to have found this. I did not see any of these episodes as a kid. The only things missing was the wonderfully kookie Aunt Clara and the first Darrin, Dick York.",1487808000,,171,4.212121212121212
6947762,5,B00S1VR6C0,"My husband got this for me for Christmas. I asked for it. When I was a kid, this was my favorite show. I love the black and white for the first two seasons. It went to color in the third season, but it's all good.  I love the episodes with Endora.  Dick York is the best Darrin. I didn't order the last season, because when they changed to Dick Sergeant for Darrin, it wasn't the same chemistry.  It was fun to see Paul Lynde in some of these episodes. He is hilarious.  There is a documentary about Elizabeth Montgomery (and Bewitched) on You Tube. By watching that documentary, you can learn why Dick York left, and why the original Gladys Kravitz had to leave the show.",1487376000,,672,4.309523809523809

6947766,5,B00S1VR6C0,"I truly love this show with all my heart! It is my 2nd favorite show! The Golden Girls will always be #1, and Bewitched will always be #2!!  Although Season 1-5 are my favorites, and the best in my opinion. Season 6 is good as well, and introduces the 2nd Darrin Stephens (Dick Sargent)! However, Dick York was my favorite Darrin. The show just wasn't the same without him! But, nonetheless, I love Dick Sargent also!! I highly recommend this set! Mill Creek Entertainment did it right, by getting jewel cases to put this in, so each disc has its own holder to keep them organized and prevent scratches. Buy it!",1477353600,6,611,4.504504504504505

6947794,5,B00S1VR6C0,"I've been a big fan of this show since I was little in the 60's.  It was fantastic, and I wish they would show more reruns of it on T.V.  I actually liked both Dick York and Dick Sargent so the change didn't bother me like it did some people.  It always makes me laugh, even after all these years!
