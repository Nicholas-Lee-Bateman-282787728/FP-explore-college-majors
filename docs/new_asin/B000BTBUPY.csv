Sure it's only like 8 mins. long(7mins,54secs to be exact)but when you are watching it, it doesn't seem like it's that short. Let's get right down to it, the tape is of all of the members talking about how they love to play their instruments(Tye, Terry, and Mike) and sing(Dryden). The members on the tape show the appreciation of what a great singer Dryden is, and also how good they all are at doing what they do. The video features 4 songs off of the Anthology album, and of course some of Dryden's trademark humor. I am a great fan of this band and I recommend this for a buy. And if you would like to meet some other great fans of AAF come on over to alienantfans.tk or the official fansite @ alienantfarm.tk",1172620800,,796,4.2781456953642385
