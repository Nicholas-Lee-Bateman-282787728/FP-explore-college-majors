7365993,5,B013I9RES0,"PBS has been running a series titled In Their Own Words and on November 3rd they will be released on DVD. I was provided advance screeners of the three programs  each to be released separately) for an objective review.  The subject of these 56-minute biographical portraits are diverse: Muppets creator Jim Henson, Heavyweight boxing champ Muhammed Ali and the longest serving monarch, Queen Elizabeth II. All of them were produced and directed by the same company and use rare archival film footage with sound bites as well posting the text of quotes attributed to these persons (hence the series title). The talking heads include those close to the subject as well as biographers and historians.

The Queen is one of the two subjects still living (Henson died years ago) and is now 89 years old. I was in elementary school when she was crowned as the Queen in 1952 and I remember our class going to a students home where there was a television to watch the coronation.  But I found I learned a lot from this hour long show which literally bring us up to September9, 2015  literally a few weeks before the show was completed.

The interviewees include former Prime Minister John Major, Steven Frears (the Director of the docu-drama The Queen), the Director of the film The Kings Speech about Elizabeths father, King George VI, a few of her biographers, both President George H.W. Bush and his wife Barbara , Actor Ben Kingsley and the Queens cousin!

There is a lot of rare archival footage of the young Queen (when she was a Princess) giving a speech.

The discussion of her raising her four children and how she handled Princess Dianas death is handled even handedly

There are no bonus or special features on the DVD. It does have the option for English subtitles but is not close captioned.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8727894,5,B013I9RES0,"Wonderful DVD on Elizabeth II and includes some footage I hadn't seen beginning in her early childhood through her 60 years on the throne.  She is now the longest reigning monarch in British history and has carried out her role as a constitutional monarch with intelligence and grace---she has dedicated her life to her people and country and is a beloved symbol of the history and continuity of England.  Well done, BBC quality video and audio.  I found this DVD a valuable addition to my collection on British queens; I recommend it for all anglophiles especially if you missed seeing it on PBS when it was broadcast here in the U.S..",1524096000,,636,4.711711711711712
8727895,4,B013I9RES0,"Begins with WWI and the sound of the family name is too German so it changed to Windsor. Elizabeth's uncle wants to marry a divorced AMERICAN (!) so he abdicates. At the age of ten Elizabeth's stammering father of 'The King's Speech' becomes King just in time for WWII. She does her duty in the war effort. She marries and has a son.

Her father's ill health causes her to become reigning monarch at age 25. Shares her travels, children, their failed marriages and the heirs. Insightful.",1514851200,,487,4.597701149425287
