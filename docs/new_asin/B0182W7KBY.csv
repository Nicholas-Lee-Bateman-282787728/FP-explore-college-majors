7538490,1,B0182W7KBY,"Everyone would be mad at me if I gave away the details of the ending, which I would be tempted to do just because I hated this one so much, but I'm just going to say it's not a pleasant one.  The last 15 minutes of the movie RUIN it!  Don't see this movie if you want a rewarding ending.  I was hooked by some of the suspense and complex relationships, but the twist ending was not just disturbing and surprising to me, but toppled all the emotional investment I had given the movie.  Within an hour after it ended, the shock had worn off on me, and I felt really upset about what the movie's ending did to it--much like how the second act of Into the Woods tore down the satisfaction of the first act.  If you want something which ends satisfactorily instead of disturbingly, stay away from this movie!

By the way, Chiwetel Ejiofor is an awesome actor, and I've seen him in 12 Years a Slave and The Martian and think he was extremely good in 12 Years a Slave, which made it extra hard to see the way this movie went downhill.  And I don't have a problem with tragedy per se, but I don't want to invest myself in tragedy unless it says something which can't be said any other way.  This movie started like a suspense thriller and became like one of those moral-dilemma, hopelessly-trapped, emotionally-racked black & white film noir movies.  If you like those, I'm sure you'll like this one.  If you want something meaningful instead of bleak to take with you out of the movie, avoid this movie.",1448323200,7,1496,4.348920863309353
7538491,3,B0182W7KBY,"Whats it about?

Julia Roberts, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Nicole Kidman star as investigators whose lives are turned upside down when one of their children is brutally murdered.

What did I think?

I cant remember if Kidman was a good actress back when her face could move, but she certainly isn't now. Luckily Roberts and Ejiofor are outstanding in this gripping thriller, which keeps you guessing and makes you feel pretty damned good about yourself when/if you work out the plot twists before they happen (er, yes, that would be me). A tale of obsession, revenge and, of course, secrets, its well told and expertly directed by Billy Ray, though confusion between past and presence could have been avoided if theyd just removed the beard on Ejiofors younger self.",1448236800,6,761,4.9296875
7538492,4,B0182W7KBY,"If you choose to do a remake of an excellent film, will changing the cast plus ramping up the violence and hysteria make it a better film? The answer is: Not really. Although three Oscar winners on board helps a bit. It is embarrassing to see a story painted in such broad strokes for an American audience.

When the Oscar-winning ""El secreto de sus ojos"" came out of Argentina in 2010, I was so blown away I couldn't wait to buy my own copy. I reviewed it in July, 2010. (Obviously I was prepared to dislike this remake, but at least director Billy Ray (""Captain Phillips"") worked with the original screenwriter Juan Jose Campanella. That made me curious...

We see:
  * Nichole Kidman (""Queen of the Desert"") Claire works with Jess and Ray.  We watch her come to her new job with great credentials and a lot of ambition. Claire takes a pivotal role in this particular case. Like Soledad Villamil before her as this character, Kidman knocks it out of the park.
  * Julia Roberts (""August: Osage County"") Jess is an invention of this new version. Roberts gets to scream and emote, but later shows us in more subtle ways what she can do with a serious role. She's no glamor puss in this one. She seems to be shooting for character roles. Good for her.
  * Zoe Graham (""Boyhood"") Carolyn  is a daughter anyone would be proud of. Her mother Jess adores her.
  * Chiwetel Ejiofor (""The Martian"") Ray is absolutely gutted by this particular crime. He can't let it go because he feels responsible. And his attraction for Claire is the worst-kept secret in the court house.
  * Dean Norris (""Under the Dome"") Bumpy is getting older but he's still willing to help Ray because both of them feel an obligation.
  * Joe Cole (""Green Room"") With Marzin/Beckwith the question is: Is he or isn't he?

As with the original, the police officers are frustrated and dismayed by all the bureaucratic maneuvering. They can find the killer but can't control the bureaucrats. In this one, our hero's employer, Homeland Security, won't let him join the manhunt because a mosque has been bombed and he has a job to do.

I re-watched ""El secreto de sus ojos"" so I could give this new version a fair hearing. This remake is actually better than I expected. (I'll bet you didn't think I would admit it, did you? ...smile...) This is pretty good, but the original is spectacular.",1448150400,7,2351,4.583732057416268

I first saw a trailer for this on YT and heard Julia's gut wrenching primal scream at the ""dumpster scene"" and at first I thought ""aint gonna be watching that one.""  But it came on a free HBO preview so I took a chance.  No movie has affected me this intensely in a long time.  The jovial jokes about ""hey don't be a dck"" and the unknowing perplexed look on her face before the reveal from her dedicated detective friend Ray Kasten is the last time her character is happy in the movie.  The dedication he shows her is on-going and unfailing as he tries for years to help her solve her pain.  I also fall in love with the unrequited desire he wrestles ( I won't say more ) and wishes he can make that happen too.  I could watch Nicole Kidman do her utterly surprising ""sexy perp taunt""  bit a 100 more times.  I have not seen that sultry side of her since Malice.  I loved this movie and I want it.

7538498,5,B0182W7KBY,"Excellent film in every way,  stressing over and over again the unpredictability of certain courses of evil in the very marginal spiritual world of detectives and officers of the court. This film has horrific impact, and a stellar cast, with Nicole Kidman at her peek, underlining the slow process of law and order, struggle to maintain a personal life with someone who merely understands her, as she states.

Julia Roberts learned how to act when she starred with Meryl Streep..an unforgettable performance, and her expressions of  negativity, and bland hope are extraordinary.

All of these characters bleed with regret at not being significant enough to hold on to those they profess to love.

This American remake is horrid, as with most American remakes of foreign films. The story contains so many plot holes and jumps back and forth through time unsuccessfully (the same tactic is used brilliantly in the original Spanish film). The acting is terrible.

7538513,2,B0182W7KBY,"I really tried to like this movie... I have a great appreciation for the talent of the cast, but I couldn't seem to connect to the plot and story itself. It's not that my mind couldn't wrap around Julia Roberts playing a role of a quiet, depressed, and vengeful Mom... it's that the story kept flipping back and forth between present story and past story, with the only obvious indicator of which timeline you were watching was whether Chiwetel Ejofor's hair was graying or not so it got quite muddled. I'm thinking that if this story were played as a straight start to finish timeline it would've been much stronger.

I think also, by the time I watched this I had had my fill of back-and-forth timeline jumping as a trope.

Couldn't even finish watching the movie.",1488585600,,766,4.583941605839416
7538514,4,B0182W7KBY,"You know I wanted to say Secret In Their Eyes is very predictable in the drama/detective genre, but there's two HUGE twists at the end that changes everything!  They both involve Julia Robert's character.  The first twist will make you say ""No way!"" but the second will make you scream ""NO WAY!""  Speaking of ""no way"", there's no way I'm saying what they are!  That would completely ruin the story up to that point.

The movie is about Julia Robert's character playing the distraught mother because her daughter was murdered and the story revolves around a team of FBI investigators (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, Nicole Kidman and Alfred Molina) who spend their time searching around town for the killer.  There *is* more focus on locating the killer than searching for clues that lead to his whereabouts.  I noticed and enjoyed that aspect of the story.  Also more emphasis on the investigators having conversations with each other than what usually happens in a detective film, but there's a reason for this (hint hint, big twists!)

At first Julia seems like the only interesting character based on the few sarcastic shots, whereas Nicole is reserved to indoors.  Alfred's your typical ""If you don't have any clues you can bet your behind I'm going to give you a hard time about it"" type of city boss which is where he and Chiwetel get into a few disagreements.

Oh and speaking of Chiwetel Ejiofor.  He's the star of the movie.  As an actor he's REALLY good and seems to only get better the more movies I watch him star in.  His character has a compassionate demeanor in Secret In Their Eyes, but also a serious/dedicated side.  He really wants to bring justice to Julia's daughter.

I have to laugh at a few moments he's involved in.  Let me first say the investigators are looking for the murderer, and end up chasing two men around who both strongly resemble the man in the picture (the man in question).  The picture shows the guy standing and looking at Julia's daughter near a picnic table.  There's a side story here involving a snitch and a fellow investigator getting punched by Chiwetel but I didn't get that part.  I didn't understand how this relates to the story.  When both men are eventually approached by the investigators, they run.  They're obviously both guilty of something, but I had trouble figuring out what it was.  Innocent people wouldn't just take off running like that!  In particular the garage scene later on and the second guy in question... yeah.

Speaking of that guy, the parts that made me laugh are when Chiwetel approaches him early on suspecting he's the murderer.  He's a horse rider.  He takes off running and Chiwetel is hot on his trail... until Chiwetel runs right into a pitchfork smacked across his stomach by the guy.  The guy then runs away while Chiwetel's lying on the ground.  I was thinking ""You didn't get hit that hard, get up!"" but I guess he got the wind knocked out of him more than it looked.  Also I was thinking ""At least you didn't get poked by that pitchfork!"" as a comical moment.

I also think it's ironic the second man nearby happened to have a cane.  What are the odds of all the people being at the horse ranch it just so happens to be an older guy with a cane who can't run after the guy?  I'm not sure if he worked at the ranch or was a fellow investigator (I think the former).  Also very baffling how in the next scene, Chiwetel isn't upset.  He's back in the investigation room acting casual like the previous event never happened.  What?  Unless this entire horse stable scene actually happened a long time ago (more on that below!)

The story gets a little ridiculous when they find the second man they're looking for (a young kid with a Russian accent) at Dodgers stadium.  A really good, albeit cliche chase scene soon follows.  This is when the story improves because up this point Secret In Their Eyes has been way too cliched of a detective film and honestly a little boring and bland.  They capture the kid and bring him in for questioning.  The story gets silly when Chiwetel's character accidentally tears Nicole's dress.  She walks into the interrogation room with her dress torn, and the suspect sees her chest.  Nicole humiliates the kid for looking at her in such a way, and he actually retaliates by standing up, exposing himself, then punching Nicole.  Of course Chiwetel beats him senseless, but it was a weird moment that didn't tie into anything with a purpose.

Oh and how about early on the VERY believable way Julia was acting when she noticed her daughter dead?  This scene looks a little too realistic so I couldn't help but get a little teary-eyed.  She really captures how unbelievably sad and horrific it is for a mother to see her child dead.  The way she grabs her daughter afterwards while incredibly upset... enough talking about it.

I got lost a few times.  Well I mean, I got lost a few times in the first 80% of the film that is.  Because obviously the two big twists involving Julia's character clear everything up.  Those two twists also *drastically* separate this film from the other detective dramas out there.  As far as the twists go, make sure you pay VERY close attention to every word Julia says in the first 80% of the movie.  If I had known she'd play such a vital moment of the story I would have listened more closely!

Anyway I got confused when the story went back to the past.  We'd see snapshots of the past events but... they were recent.  Ones we just watched in the film earlier.  Didn't quite understand that.  And the story with Chiwetel being away for over a decade, and the concern Julia had that he didn't really care about her daughter even though he most certainly did.  Julia and Alfred in particular question Chiwetel's reason for caring so hard about the case given all the time he spent away.  It all felt like the story wasn't giving us enough information on the past events involving these characters except for little bits and pieces that we had to figure out the meaning behind.  Unfortunately I'm the kind of person who needs to be flat out told what's going on in order to grasp it!

The acting's fabulous by everyone involved, but I just know the Secret In Their Eyes was mostly relying on the popularity of 3 big name actors and actresses to carry it through, and less focus was given to an original story.  That's why the first half of the movie felt so bland like a normal detective story.  There's also several moments of downtime in between the few action scenes.  The investigators talk to each other very quietly so it's hard to figure out what's being said.  This movie is more 3.5 but I'll be nice because of the two major twists at the end and bump it to a 4.",1487376000,,6718,4.565690376569037

7538538,5,B0182W7KBY,"As a person who has lived a lot of years and has seen an awful lot of movies, I have to say there was something in this film that I never quite experienced before.  Most movie and TV dramas tend to give themselves away long before their denouement, long before their intended narrative conclusionary section.  In large part, I think that's because authors feel compelled to put a lot of stuff into a very limited time on screen.  Hence, the point toward which things are being driven can be felt early, and some effort has to me made by the audience not to experience premature spoiler alerts.

  The incredible thing here was its life-like pacing.  In part the anticipation of where the arc was going was camouflaged by the time lapse breakup of temporal sequence, taking you back and forth into elements of the story-- a genuine achievement for its author/director. But especially spectacular was the acting.  In real life, only things that have actually happened tell you where things are going-- sometimes!  That's why in real life we always get hit right between the eyes when so much of the stuff we live through finally in fact arrives.

  In movies, however, there is powerful what I would call ""script propulsion"": things seem to gather first and then, when a critical mass is reached, they happen.  This enhances anticipation and provides the audience a certain sense of satisfaction when things turn out as they were supposed to.  But not in this film.  It captured the dull thud anguish or real life, the way things go OK until a totally unexpected thud hits.  I never knew where this thing was going, or why, until it happened.  This was very emotionally disconcerting, making me wish for some sort of commercial so I could put the think on pause and go off to do something else.  BUT I NEVER DID!!!  It held me the way I'm held when I'm doing a psychotherapy session.

  The humanity of it all holds you down, in as unrecognizable a fashion as gravity holds us to the earth.  All I know, I was moving from event to event, events that all stood out, NOT because they had to occur for the story to make sense or end in a way that would give satisfaction to the audience's sense of storytelling, but because they happened.  There was no reason why the story had to move in the way it did, it just did.  This is very hard to produce, and it is more likely in very long novels.

  And to return to the actors, none of this sense of things having happened only because they did could have come across had their performances not been spectacular.  Like the left leg show when Kidman and Ejiofor were running up a set of outdoor stairs: I was at first inclined to choke that up to a bit of Kidman's compulsive ""for the troops"" exhibitionism, but that feeling went away very quickly when I realized that her drenched sexualness was meant to be in stark contrast to Julia Roberts' full commitment to a complete ""over the hill"" female persona.  Roberts' mother-daughter scene around the girl's dating a 22 y/o was another spectacular piece: Roberts looked younger and less drawn in that moment-- after all, it took place prior to the horror point of the emerging eventuality of the film-- but still as prudishly ambivalent around sexuality (just enough to have happened rather than being a mere fallout from the type of character the film was trying to tell us she was) as one might expect between mother and daughter.  Roberts was indeed caught in a moment of struggle that every parent goes through when a daughter presents herself as a sexual object.  I was struck more by the kind of good relationship there seemed o exist between mother and daughter, more than by the ugly/smearing-of-the-moment thought that the guy she might be going out with might be her Murderer (which it could not really have been).

  Finally, I loved the respectfully subtle way the ever-emergent love relationship between Ejiofor and Roberts got played out.  One never knew whether the problem keeping them apart was her ambitiousness, their relative class status, race, or what.  After years of adult interactions with women at work that might or might not lead to something (or should or should not be risked starting), I could well recognize the polite saraband that occurs in real life these days of sexual harassment lawsuits and complaints, particularly when there are real feelings there-- and such a mature and respectful rendering could NEVER have been written by any writer-director who supplies his libido via the casting couch.

  All in all, this was for me at my age an outstandingly ADULT movie that teenagers would surely find too lacking in testosterone jags.  I am most grateful for the grown-up experience it provided, causing me even to accept the painfully ambiguous ending that left many strands flowing in the wind-- all because, even the end, JUST HAPPENED.  Thank you Billy Ray and actors for an adult collection of happenings that didn't get an Oscar (or even an Oscar nomination), but sure did get my five stars on Amazon, N.",1471651200,6,5036,4.7020547945205475

7538561,3,B0182W7KBY,"Spoiler alert.  Stocked heavily with fine actors, this remake of an Argentinian Oscar winner from 2009 comes up a bit short as far as intensity but still provides for a delectable mystery.  For the most part the film is set in 2002 L. A. where an FBI counter-intelligence unit is focusing on a mosque where one of their informants is providing information critical in this period just past 9/11.

Chiwetel Ejiofor stars as Ray Kasten who works with Jessica Cobb (Julia Roberts, very glammed down) who are called to a murder scene.  Obviously not their usual beat but the site is next to the mosque.  What they find is a brutal torture/murder of a female teenager.  It happens to be Jesss daughter.  After a scene of gut-wrenching anguish, we jump ahead 13 years.  The killer was never found.  Jess is still with the FBI, along with a few others who were around at the time.  That includes Assistant D. A. Claire Sloan (Nicole Kidman) who was new to the department in 2002.  Ray left the department shortly after the event but having been working on the case for 13 years on his own has finally figured out who committed the crime.

With some reluctance Claire reopens the case on the down-low.  It also refuels a subtle romance between her and Ray.  Early on it is quite confusing, not only because of a convoluted plot, but because of the frequent flash-backs to 2002 and even earlier to show the deep connection between Jess and her daughter Carolyn (Zoe Graham, Boyhood) before the murder.  My key was to focus on flecks of grey hair on Ray and the hairstyles on the ladies.

While the story has a surprising conclusion that calls ethics and morality into question, it is for the most part a boilerplate mystery.  The characters, even those in a supporting role (Alfred Molina, Dean Norris, Michael Kelly), seem one-dimensional with a constant dour look on their face.  There is one terrific scene between Claire and the suspected killer (Joe Cole) that almost makes the movie worthwhile.  As it is it, it runs 110 minutes and you may have better options.",1463356800,,2058,4.666666666666667

7538597,4,B0182W7KBY,"This is an English-language re-make of an award-winning Argentinian film. The genders of some of the lead characters have been changed from the Argentinian original, generally to good effect.

All the characters are given legitimate reasons for taking the stands they do. No one comes off as a villain. For example, we get to see District Attorney Morales point when he tries to squelch any further pursuit of a suspect in the rape/murder of the daughter of a fellow officer that occurred 13 years previous.

My main problem with the movie is that I found its interweaving views of then and now sometimes distracting. In the directors commentary that accompanies the film, Billy Ray recognizes that he sometimes might have made a clearer distinction between scenes taking place 13 years previous  and scenes in the present. He somewhat regretted that he hadnt made actor Ejiofors hair grayer in the present scenes, so that viewers could clearly recognize which time frame they were in. However, on the whole, Ray wasn't too displeased with the subtleness of his transitions  showing Detective Bumpy Willis as being slightly balder and with a limp in the present, showing Christmas decorations in one time frame, but absent in another. The Director said he believed this subtlety kept audiences more involved, more on their toes.

Well, I don't know. I was left just plain confused several times about when something was taking place  and so the plot lacked some coherence, some continuity for me. I didn't realize what had happened until I listened to that bonus commentary.

I also found Julia Roberts chapped, drawn, lifeless, portrayal 13 years after her daughters murder  just a bit over-the-top. She appears like a shocking deaths head, a shadow of her former self. Of course, suffering such a tragedy can do that. But one might think her determination to see the murderer punished might have given her at least a glint of animation.

The best part of this movie for me though was the unusual, restrained romance that it included. Two of the characters have sustained a real longing for each other over the 13-year interval in which this murder case was shelved and they were separated. I remember years ago, social/literary critic Harold Bloom said he had really wanted another title for his controversial book that came out as The Closing of the American Mind. He had wanted to title his book Souls Without Longing. He found that to be the most conspicuous failing of young people and of our modern age. With our emphasis on instant gratification, we have denied ourselves the exquisite tenderness of longing.

The two main characters in this movie, with the singular longing they have sustained for each other, present a rare corrective to our current generally dreary state of affairs. Overall, this is a very worthwhile, soul-searching movie.",1459036800,,2852,4.9978902953586495

We cried in the first ten minutes, which is pretty impressive for a movie to get that much emotion out of someone even though it's barely started, and there was a fairly interesting plot twist at the end of this long movie.

That being said, there were some unresolved issues I felt between some of the characters at the end of the movie. Enough so that it reminded me of almost every South Korean and Japanese movie I've ever seen where most of the plot remain unresolved, and the ending just leaves you wanting something more.

7538655,4,B0182W7KBY,"Writer/director Billy Ray assumed a threatening role when he set about to re-write and direct the superb Argentine film ""El secreto de sus ojos""  the tense script by Juan Jos Campanella and Eduardo Sacheri  - and though the stories do not compare, the film is a strong one, largely due to a cast and cinematographer that would be difficult to improve.

2002: Ray Kasten (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Jess Cooper (Julia Roberts) are two investigators in a private police unit led by the DA. When they receive an anonymous tip about a girl raped and killed, they rush to the scene. Ray realizes it is Jess' daughter and the team falls apart due to the grief. In 2015, Ray comes back to LA, and says that after 13 years, he has found a lead and convinces the DA Claire (Nicole Kidman) to reopen the case. They find clues and leads unknown to them, and secrets from the past come to light as they start discovering the real, chilling truth. Meanwhile, Jess, dissatisfied with the law, decides to take matters into her own hands and track down the killer, no matter what lengths she must go to merit her vengeance.

The supportive cast is outstanding  Michael Kelly as a detective on the team, Alfred Molina as a corrupt cop who prefers focus on discovering terrorists to aiding in the investigation of the death of Jess daughter (Zoe Graham), Joe Cole as the police snitch in the terrorism hunt, and others. The bouncing around the time frames becomes a bit disconcerting at times (the only way to gage the different years of the story is by the color of Eijiofors hair!)

The man in question has some resemblance, but is not a 100% match suggesting facial surgery.

The production flip flops between the present and the past. Our suspect was a key mosque informant for the FBI who were not willing to give up the informant for a simple rape and murder charge. Kidman undergoes make-up changes while Julie Roberts looks devoid of make-up and tired for most of the film. The acting was well done, the plot had a twist, but the drama wasn't as engaging as I would have expected from such a cast.

7538668,4,B0182W7KBY,"Secret in Their Eyes stars three Academy award winners: Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), Nicole Kidman (The Hours), and Julia Roberts (Erin Brockovich). A team of investigators  Ray (Ejiofor), Jess (Roberts) and their supervisor Claire (Kidman)  is torn apart when they discover that Jess teenage daughter has been brutally and inexplicably murdered.

After obsessively searching for the elusive killer every day for 13 years, Ray finally uncovers a new lead that hes certain will resolve the case, nail the murderer, and bring long-desired closure to his team. But other officials stand in the way of Rays being able to arrest him.

A remake of Juan Jose Campanellas Oscar-winning Argentinian thriller El secret de sus ojos, Secret in Their Eyes is set in Los Angeles and flashes back and forth between 2002 and 2015. A subplot involves Rays one-time attraction to Claire and its rekindling when they meet again after many years apart.

While not as effective as the original, the film works as a solid crime thriller, distinguished mostly by its high-profile cast. The original film was inspired in part by anger over the terroristic Argentine military government in the 1970s. The new Secret follows its predecessor fairly closely but sets it in a post-9/11 world. A few plot points reflect sloppy writing, such as Rays claim that he checked close to 2,000 mug shots every night for 13 years in his quest for the murder suspect. This seems not only unlikely, but impossible.

Of the three leads, Ejiofor makes the best impression, even as he delivers less-than-sparkling dialogue. His energy and commitment to the role drive the story forward and keep us involved. Roberts has done much better work in previous films and too often overplays here. Kidman doesnt really etch a memorable impression. A few surprises along the way prevent the picture from being just another police procedural.

Chiwetel Ejiofor and Julia Roberts were very good.  C'mon who put Nicole Kidman in that role?  I have seen her do powerful acting in other movies but in this she seemed helpless and wishy washy.  And she didn't age one iota.  The husband saying ""he's been living here the last 12 years"" was ridiculous.",1455926400,10,744,4.625954198473282

7538686,5,B0182W7KBY,"Right at the outset, I do have to say that I have not seen the original film that this movie has been remade from; The 2009 Academy Award-winning Foreign Language Film from Argentina titled, El Secreto de sus Ojos. I have only read from all the other reviewers just how superior the original version is by comparison. I do intend now, after viewing this version, to see the original so I might compare the two also and am greatly looking forward to it. I found it important that the director of the original film (Juan Jose Campanella) worked closely on this version in the role of executive producer although as I see from the reviews, this one paled in its comparison to the original work as so many usually do. It is very few and far between that I have read when a remake fares better than (or even carries the same weight as) the original of any artistic work.

With all this already said I have to say that I really enjoyed this film actually because it was a very far cry from my usual picks and I was held spellbound during certain intense scenes. I found the lead actors, Nicole Kidman (Claire), Chiwetel Ejiofor (Ray) and Julia Roberts (Jess) emotionally vested in this film and equally with each other within it. I easily connected with them in the different time spans we went through. At times, the continuity was not as fluid as I would have liked, but I was still able to follow along and this is not a genre of film that I usually view. I mainly come from the feel good flicks crowd and this film takes on a tone that is much darker, intense, more involved and even adds enough suspense for me to be compelled from looking away during several points of interest. These three people are in various degrees and levels of investigation and are in Los Angeles working in specific places during post 9/11 time when the country was in a heightened state of alert. A specific tragedy then occurs that was acted with such precision from Ray who finds one of their own children murdered. Just his face alone emotes volumes as he sees the lifeless form in a dumpster and immediately knows this is Jesss daughter. This brings a stabbing pain straight to the sensitive viewer. Jesss response is equal in its poignancy, painful and heart wrenching while stripping off her plastic lab gloves and rocking her child against her. I was flabbergasted straight away from the incident. Seeing Julia Roberts without being all glammed up was very believable and had me thinking she can certainly master character roles she has made her own, which includes her part in August, Osage County.

From here on, we are dealing with extreme grief and the intensity of loss exuding from Jess. All three are obviously living with different degrees of guilt and loss also over the situation. The film does begin as Ray comes back to the office of these investigators, bureaucrats, and crooked police to ask to reopen the case as he has found something of serious importance. As he believes he has found the person responsible because of thirteen years during endless days of searching. Claire wishes to reopen it also but cannot hurt Jess any longer. As Jess remains reticent over finding this paroled man, she tells Ray, I don't think I have the stomach to watch him walk away now. This is so understandable considering she lost - What made me, me. The role of Jess took on an emotional life of her own even if she didn't have very much screen time while the film concentrated on the relationship between Claire and Ray who are struggling with a mutual attraction on both sides that they have been dealing with for years. While Ray and Claire were in a particular scene she steps up her game to push a certain issue. She completely made the scene her own while punching her emasculating point on a specific suspect. In fact, I felt Kidman owned so much of this character also. She heightened her game here.

There were a couple plot holes that could have guided me from where I needed to be looking, although I didn't fall through them and followed this film onto its twists and turns at its end. I didn't see them coming and was ultimately surprised by what I saw. This was written and directed by Billy Ray and I thought he brought me on one quizzical ride. I have read that this can be compared to a CSI episode I have not seen CSI, also the comparisons written above about the original work, or just plain not a good movie. For me, I thought it all came together quite nicely and is a film that I will be thinking about until I get my hands on the original",1454976000,17,4544,4.505454545454546
7538687,5,B0182W7KBY,"Secret in Their Eyes is a neat, carefully assembled, multi-layered narrative film Noir set in Los Angeles, 2002 and 2015-- capitalizing on the dread and frustration of immediate Post-9/11 America. Director Billy Ray's film is in no way the works that came before it, but on it's own-- I think it works pretty well.

For the cast; Nicole Kidman is terrific in this-- Easily the best of the ensemble. Julia Roberts handles an a-typical role with ease. Chiwetel Ejiofor is on cruise control-- which means he's effective here.

The story works wonders as an LA Noir, not so much as a cohesive, audience-friendly mystery. But what can I say-- I love me a good old fashioned LA Noir (this in no way feels like the earlier Spanish rendition of the novel. It feels distinctly American in nature.)

Oh and kudos to the finely composed, beautifully lit and articulated cinematography from Daniel Moder. His Noir images are so good. Not as modern as say, Nightcrawler (2014), but extremely classical none-the-less.

Forget the blah-blah-blah over comparisons with the 2009 film and the original novel-- just take the film for something new, a very solid LA film noir with an array of fine performances and a compelling and adult mystery swirling around at its dark hearted core. It's nothing ""mind blowing""-- if you're new to the material-- but do keep in mind director Billy Ray, rightfully, keeps things muted and brooding-- just like an good Noir should be. And going in knowing that, you should certainly enjoy yourself.",1454976000,,1513,4.921568627450981

A bit confusing what timline you're watching in the first 30 minutes as it jumps back and forth at will. Rent it, don't purchase this blindly.  Some scenes have you scratching the noggin.  The detectives are at a baseball game looking for the killer in a sea of 70'000 people. I won't say how lucky they get but you could guess.

Even the loss of a major character in the original is replaced with the loss of a bad guy to appease to the ""feel-good"" movie paradigm. It's a cheap American remake and it feels like exactly that.

7538691,3,B0182W7KBY,"Good actors, never get off the ground. Julie Roberts in invested in the role, but given little screen time. There is power there, so why not show it.

7538692,3,B0182W7KBY,"The difficulty in judging any remake is separating it from the original. Sometimes this can be pretty easy, but when the source is an Oscar winner like Juan Jose Campanella's moody and excellent The Secret In Their Eyes, it can be especially tough. To put into perspective the high regard there is for that Argentinian film, it defeated The White Ribbon and A Prophet in the Best Foreign Language category, two films that have not diminished in standing in the years since. So Billy Ray's American remake, simply titled Secret In Their Eyes perhaps to avoid confusing the audience that probably has no idea it's a remake, has very tough shoes to fill.

While it doesn't quite pack the emotional or political heft of the original, Secret In Their Eyes isn't just another meaningless redo. Despite a few hokey twists, it works as an efficient, melancholic crime procedural and examination of grief and loss. Expertly navigating between the past and the present, the film mostly takes place in Los Angeles in the months following the 9/11 attacks. Back then it was expected that the west coast was the next likely target for terrorists, and the country was at high alert. It also opened up a pervasive ""ends justifying the means"" approach to national security, and into this world enters Ray (Chiwetel Ejiofor), an FBI agent on the counter-terrorism task force. He's been assigned to keep tabs on a nearby mosque that could be a terrorist hot spot, but his eyes are focused more on Claire (Nicole Kidman), the District Attorney he shares an instant connection with. He works alongside his best friend, Jess (Julia Roberts), who never misses an opportunity to needle him about his workplace crush.

Ray, an expert scribe who wrote and directed the excellent Shattered Glass, Breach and penned The Hunger Games, focuses on the connection between these three people and the little details in their lives. That's what makes it so heart-breaking when a murdered girl discovered near the mosque turns out to be Jess' daughter. The look of anguish on Ray's face when he makes the discovery and realizes he must break it to his friend. The look of unimaginable pain and loss on her face upon seeing her dead girl, the ""thing that makes me me"" she says, is indescribable. Years later as Ray returns to help close the unsolved murder case, the guilt and despair weighing on all of them is never far away.

Ray's pursuit of the alleged killer, an informant he's come to know as Marzin, is complicated by an array of insiders, corrupt cops, and ambitious politicians each with their own agendas. But the same can be said of Ray, Jess, and Claire who each carry reasons for wanting, or not wanting, to see the case solved. That demands the audience pay the utmost attention to every detail, especially as time jumps back and forth between the past and present. The transition is always seamless, with it always clear how decisions made in the past continue to have an impact. The character details and much of the plot remains untouched, but what's missing is the gripping edge-of-your-seat tension, perhaps because Ray is more attuned to screenwriting than visual flair. This is never more obvious than in his limp recreation of the unforgettable stadium chase scene.

Naturally, it's tough to find fault in the three lead stars, but supporting players like Dean Norris, Michael Kelly, and Alfred Molina shouldn't be overlooked. Kidman and Ejiofor have terrific sexual chemistry, important because much of the film deals with their unrequited passion. They may have gone a little overboard in trying to make Roberts look normal. Decked out in the drabbest outfits they could find from the nearby Goodwill, the heavy-handed depiction of Jess telegraphs what should have been a meaningful, surprising reveal. Secret In Their Eyes isn't going to make anyone forget the original, but it's possible to have an appreciation for both without diminishing either.",1448409600,27,3939,4.9366515837104075
