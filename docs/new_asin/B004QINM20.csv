4445344,5,B004QINM20,"As an ardent student of the Asian healing arts I found Qigong for Longevity to be a very interesting and informative DVD. Grandmaster Kao presents varied exercises for the different parts of the body which purports to heal and provide for a longer and healthier lifestyle.

The exercises, 12 in number, can be performed while seated and are very easy to follow. While there is no explanation of why the exercises work, they are presumed to be related to the art of Qigong. The exercises are so simplified that even a dilletante can follow and do them with ease. No prior knowledge of Qigong or martial arts is necessary for the exercises and it is recommended that they be done daily.

This DVD can be utilized by the beginner, intermediate or advanced student. Actually, anyone can benefit from watching and practising the exercises which take only thirty minutes in total. My recommendation is to order the DVD, sit down and start exercisng for a better and possibly a longer life.",1305417600,2,983,4.776470588235294
4445345,5,B004QINM20,"This DVD is shorter in length than most of the YMAA material. It runs 50 minutes. (there is an extended section at the end that highlights various other DVD training material).

Grandmaster Kao, Tao was Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming's first tai chi teacher. He must be in his 80's and he looks young and vigorous. Dark, thick hair, clear, wrinkle free skin, flexible, and a sweet, happy smile make him the perfect advertisement for Qigong for health.

Grandmaster Kao, Tao instructs a series of 12 qigong exercises designed for longevity and to prevent premature aging symptoms. The sets are done seated and are easy to follow. Healing Sound Breathing is used to clear the organs and stagnant qi. Working from the head down to the toes, instructions are given for the following body sections:
Brain, Ears, Eyes, Nose, Teeth, Neck and Throat, Arm and Shoulder, Chest Acupressure, Abdomen Massage, Leg, and Toe Qigong. There is a testicular massage that was shown briefly that you won't see in many other DVDs. A chart was used to show how women can locate their ovaries and do a self massage. Most movements are done in sets of 36. Some explanation is given as to why the movements are done, however is it not very detailed, as in some other YMAA sets. Because it is kept simple, the qigong is easy to follow and very doable for most people.

The skill level is listed at one and no prior experience is needed. It should take about a half hour daily to do the entire set. Grandmaster Kao, Tao says that if you do the eye exercise, as directed, you will no longer need glasses.

I liked the sweet energy of Grandmaster Kao and would recommend that both the beginner and experienced try this short Qigong practice.",1305331200,,1702,4.644518272425249
4445346,5,B004QINM20,"This DVD provides a set of 12 seated exercises containing elements which long-term Qi Gong practitioners will immediately recognize. When you first insert the disc, you are provided a very simple menu consisting of a play all, scene selection, and an extras option. The extras section is standard to all YMMA DVDs, and contains a catalog of other YMMA products along with the credits. The scene selection will let you pick any of the 12 exercises or the preview.

The preview begins with a very brief history of GM Kao. While I understand that the focus of the DVD is on the exercises, I would have liked to learn more about the instructor, particularly where he has studied, whom did he study under, what he has practiced in the past, etc. However, this is simply a personal preference, and does not detract from the content provided on the disc.

The preview then leads into the 12 exercises, lasting approximately 22 minutes. The exercises in order are:
1. The six healing sounds
2. Strong Brain Qi Gong
3. Strong Ears Qi Gong
4. Strong Eyes Qi Gong
5. Strong Nose Qi Gong
6. Strong Teeth Qi Gong
7. Neck and Throat Qi Gong
8. Arm and Shoulder Qi Gong
9. Chest Accupressure Qi Gong
10. Abdominal Massage
11. Leg Qi Gong
12. Toe Qi Gong

The Qi Gong movements and instructions are simple enough to follow, the camera angle is aimed perfectly so you can see everything you need. The follow up in-depth sections cover each exercise in further detail, and the viewer is given the various nuances of movements and requirements which may not be initially apparent.

Of note is the Strong Ears Qi Gong in which some may recognize elements ""Beating the Heavenly Drum,"" the Neck and Throat Qi Gong which contains the Turtle exercise, and the Abdominal Massage which looks... somewhat uncomfortable. Overall, another great product from YMMA.",1383350400,9,1834,4.721875
4445347,4,B004QINM20,"My first impressions of this video were quite mixed. I was pleased to see a set of seated Qigong exercises, but some of the exercises are not ones that I would feel comfortable doing in front of others. Also, having acquired many of Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming's instructional materials, I felt as if the content of this video was too brief; I like more explanation of why things work and this video focuses only on teaching you what to do. That said, you do feel better after following the exercises, and they can be done by just about anyone at anytime. Worth a serious look if (like me) you are getting on in years but still like turning to the martial arts for exercise.",1314835200,6,667,4.430894308943089
4445348,4,B004QINM20,"This DVD presents a set of 12 exercises demonstrated by Grandmaster Kao Gao, along with six healing sounds.

I must admit that at first I was a little puzzled by these exercises. However, as I worked with them I began to sense how powerful they really are even after a short time. This is not surprising, as I have had similar experiences with other new ideas and practices.

It is very moving to see this 80-year-old master performing and teaching these exercises, and to practice along with him, benefiting from the strength, concentration and intensity with which he approaches them. The whole routine takes 30 minutes a day, and is listed at skill level number one, meaning it is accessible to anyone.

I don't know whether I will live longer from these exercises, but there's lots to learn from and grow with here. I also suggest Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming's book, Qigong for Arthritis as well as his DVD, Simple Qigong Exercises for Arthritis Relief, for those of us who are trying to stay fit as tAhe years go by.",1313193600,8,1014,4.653631284916201
4445349,3,B004QINM20,"good excercise routine.  a little over priced I would say since the information it provide is not a lot, many repetations.  something good as a follow a long.",1310947200,3,158,4.607142857142857
4445350,5,B004QINM20,"The contents of this DVD consist of 12 relatively simple, seated exercises starting at the head and moving towards the toes.  Regular practice of these exercises reduces fatigue while promoting joint mobility and muscular control.  Additionally, six healing sounds massage the vital organs while increasing lung capacity and promoting healthy, strong breathing and improving general lung health.  The physical movements combined with the breathing exercise together promote healthy cardiovascular circulation.  A gradual improvement of general physical well-being will help combat depression, an often common issue with those reaching their golden years or restricted to wheelchairs or assisted care facilities.

The greatest benefit of this DVD is that Grandmaster Kao introduces age-old exercises that are done from a seated position, clearly illustrating the possibilities of introducing beneficial qigong concepts and exercises to those people that are physically restricted to other more rigorous forms of exercise.  There is no reason that these twelve movements and six breathing techniques cannot be introduced into nursing care facilities across the globe.  Grandmaster Kao's performance clearly illustrates the effectiveness of routine practice of these exercises.  As a man in his eighties, his overall range of motion, mental clarity, and even sense of humor are atypical of many westerners in his age group.

Through Grandmaster Kao, Tao, YMAA Publications have given qigong and martial arts instructors a toolkit that can be (I even say, should be) used to reach and appeal age group that is often forgotten or not even considered for qigong training.  It is not too late!",1310428800,3,1686,5.654761904761905
4445351,5,B004QINM20,"This is a very interesting and valuable DVD. It is definitely worth 5 stars for its target audience which consists of people who find themselves becoming older but who still want to follow an exercise pattern that improves their health and quality of life. A person who is much younger and athletically fit might find the Qigong for Longevity process to be strange and maybe boring. But, for those people who are getting older will really get a lot of benefit from Qigong for Longevity.

Grandmaster Kao Tao was the first tai chi teacher of Dr. Yang, Zwing-Ming, starting in 1962 in Taiwan. He is 80 years old but could be mistaken for a fit 55 year old person. He demonstrates the Qigong for Longevity process and certainly appears to have benefited from it.

The DVD starts with a 20 minute demonstration of the 12 seated Qigong movements that you will follow along with as you do the exercises. The Qigong for Longevity steps are a combination of muscle stimulation exercises, breathing exercises and muscle massage. Many of these steps seem to target circulation and muscle stimulation. Some carry an explanation that they are targeting acupuncture cavities. Some of the physical exercises focus on muscles that we don't usually exercise but which probably should since they are an important part of healthy living. These include facial muscles, ears / hearing, eyes / vision, nose, jaws, shoulders and arms,abdominals, knees, ankles and feet. The 20 minute process, starts at the top of the head and face and then systematically moves down to the arms, core muscles, knees and toes.

Following the 20 minute demo there is approximately 40 minutes of more detailed instructions and explanations of the benefits for each step. You will play the 20 minute demo many times and watch the 40 minute instructions just a few times.

The 12 Qigong movements are as follows:
 1. HEALING SOUND BREATHING &
 2  STRONG BRAIN QIGONG
 3. STRONG EARS QIGONG
 4. STRONG EYES QIGONG
 5. STRONG NOSE QIGONG
 6. STRONG TEETH QIGONG
 7. NECK & THROAT QIGONG
 8. ARM & SHOULDER QIGONG
 9. CHEST ACUPRESSURE QIGONG
10. ABDOMEN MASSAGE
11. LEG QIGONG
12  TOE QIGONG",1308700800,16,2146,4.857142857142857
4445352,5,B004QINM20,"This DVD program presents a simple, short and surprisingly easy qigong routine for improving and maintaining health and promoting longevity.

All twelve of the qigong exercises are performed sitting on a chair. The routine can be practiced anywhere - even from your office chair at work - or from the side of your bed each morning (or evening) - it's that easy.

The program is taught by grandmaster Kao, Tao, who happens to be an energetic and surprisingly healthy looking 80 year old Taiwanese tai chi and qigong master.  Grandmaster Kao practices tai chi and this qigong routine every day, which he attributes to his mental and physical well being.

The DVD program is divided into two sections: The first section follows grandmaster Kao as he demonstrates the twelve step routine. In the second section grandmaster Kao demonstrates the routine again with brief commentary regarding breathing and hand/finger positions and locations, etc.

""Qigong for Longevity"" - at 50 minutes in length - is a short, compact DVD program offering simple and easy qigong exercise that can be easily learned and practiced by almost anyone. The entire sequence takes about 30 minutes (depending on repetitions) and can easily be incorporated into one's schedule. It is suitable for practitioners of all levels, including seniors and those of us with limited mobility, flexibility and/or strength.",1308182400,3,1381,5.202702702702703
4445353,5,B004QINM20,"An easy to follow video with beautiful scenery.  Grandmaster Kao, Tao moves through exercises for 12 different areas on the body with explanations on why they are helpful.  He moves through areas from several points on your face/head all the way down to your toes.  It also includes a testicular massage for men, demonstrated by Grandmaster Kao, as well as an ovarian massage for women.

The movements are intended to help with the flow of blood and energy, which in turn helps with organ function, through some of the acupressure points in the body and are easy to follow.  They are mostly demonstrated while sitting in a chair and are accompanied by breathing exercises as well.  These can be beneficial even for beginners and gentle enough for those who wake up sore or stiff.",1307664000,3,779,4.776119402985074
4445354,5,B004QINM20,"My first thought watching this dvd was how grateful I am to Grandmaster Kao, Tao for taking the time to make this dvd. He is in his 80s and obviously very vibrant. These secrets of his personal training routine are a valuable gift.

This dvd addresses many of the typical problems that come with aging: eye problems, hearing problems, digestion, knees, neck and shoulder stiffness, etc. The first time I did it, it eliminated some neck pain I'd been carrying around for a week. Now that I've been doing it for a while, I notice that my allergies are better.

One of the most interesting features of the dvd, though, is that almost all of the exercises are done in a chair. Obviously this is helpful for seniors or people with limited mobility. My mother, who is in her 80s and has limitations on her mobility could do all of them. I'm in my 50s and fairly fit. I find them useful for those times when I'm a blob and I don't want to move. I can tell myself that I don't have to get up and exercise. I can just sit and do a little qigong. By the time I'm finished, I have the energy that I want to get up and move. They are a nice transition into either my Tai Chi routine or more vigorous exercise.

BTW, I received the item free of charge in exchange for an honest review.

4445355,5,B004QINM20,"Through massage of acupuncture points and stimulation of exterior tissues and internal organs, better health and vitality can be maintained into old age.  No prior experience is required, and simple instructions (in clear English and sub-titles) are demonstrated by Grandmaster Kao Tao all while sitting in a chair. Grandmaster Kao is a joy; bright-eyed, nimble, a hearty fare thee well smiling 80 year old with an abundance of energy, and a youthful appearance, and only his hairdresser knows for sure.  I believe that these exercises can improve circulation, digestion, organ function and perhaps after six months even eliminate the need for eyeglasses.  I don't wear eyeglasses yet, and with these exercises may never have to.  However, I am in my fifties and hope my graying hair will return someday to a reddish-black like Sifu's.",1305504000,2,835,5.208955223880597

I happen to have a friend who has studied Tai Chi and Kung Fu from Dr. Wang, Jwing-Ming, YMAA in Boston, who is highly regarded. Qigong for Longevity by Grandmaster Kao, Tao was his teacher so I felt comfortable to purchase it. I'm interested in supporting other natural remedies like acupuncture, diet, meditation and exercise that I'm doing to alleviate constant migraines and other ailments. I'm 56 and can't get good exercise because my neck and back muscles are so sensitive. This is a very easy sitting practice. It covers maintaining healthy vision, brain, hearing, sense of smell, sinuses, teeth and facial muscles to release tension held in the jaw, healthy neck muscles and draining of the lymph, and so forth -- I wish I had this to incorporate when I was in my twenties. Easy to just take a few minutes in the morning to get your blood going before meditation. Just the consciousness alone that you're focusing on improving and helping your body is probably a huge benefit.
