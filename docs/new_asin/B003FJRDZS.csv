8698319,5,B003FJRDZS,"I have been a priest for 44 years and a pastor for the last 24 of those 44 years.  I know all too well how pornography torments and corrupts human beings and brings marriages tumbling down.  No one is immune from the ravages of pornography, not even those who go to church every Sunday.  I found this video most encouraging.  It is the story of how some modern day ""knights in shining armor"" determined to slay the dragon that was threatening their community.  By going public in their opposition to pornography, these men reinforced their own determination not to surrender to the dragons that lurk within.
Like the Marines, God is always on the lookout for a few good men.  He found them in Mark Houck and Damian Wargo and their fellow ""King's Men"".
Inside every man and boy, there is a knight who is yearning to be released in order to do good deeds for the King and, incidentally, to make himself worthy of the love of a fair lady.
This video is a clarion call to oppose the enemy of the human race and to reclaim that portion of God's kingdom that has been stolen from Him by lust and pornography.
I recommend ""What's That Purple Building, Daddy?""",1271376000,,1152,4.461904761904762
