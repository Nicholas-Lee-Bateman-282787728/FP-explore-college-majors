2657975,4,B000IJ7A0G,"This is a really great exercise video.  You get two solid workouts that are easy to follow, work the entire body,  and leave you with that ""I just did something realy good for myself today"" feeling.  I only wish it was a little longer.  I like to aim for 45 minutes.  These two run for about 30 each (including warm-up, work-out, and cooldown/stretching).  If you are pressed for time these are for you.  Great for beginners too.",1206403200,8,429,4.4935064935064934
2657976,3,B000IJ7A0G,"I was an avid step aerobic addict for many years, but a series of bad repetitive-motion injuries forced me to stop just about all types of exercise except walking.  I prefer to walk outside, but in Indiana this is often a problem in the winter.  After trying Leslie Samsone's AND Prevention's walking videos, all of which had too much marching in them, I had high hopes for this one.  Although I like the scenery a lot, and do prefer Debbie Rocker's personality, this video is disappointing in two significant ways.  First, there is TOO MUCH MARCHING IN PLACE!!  I do not understand why these instructors use marching as a warm-up or a place for supposed rest or cool-down, when actually marching in place is very difficult for anyone with repetitive-motion injuries!!!  The movements that are actually less stressful to the joints are the step-tap types that are used elsewhere in the video.  During the marching segments, I substitute step-tap type movements, or just walk in time around the room.  Second, Debbie has made some very basic errors in her cueing.  She refers to ""left"" and ""right"" without realizing that for the viewer these sides are reversed.  Another annoying habit she has is to tell the viewer that we are about to change to a new step or pattern, but then take FOREVER to actually make the change.  Furthermore, there is no predictable rhythmic set-up for the change each time.  Sometime she'll give 4 beats preparation, sometimes much more.  The moves are, of course very easy, but for a seasoned instructor like Debbie, why are her instructions so sloppy?
I'll probably use this video on poor-weather days until I find (hopefully) one that is better suited to my needs.",1199145600,8,1693,4.836805555555555
2657977,5,B000IJ7A0G,"I was after a walking workout with basic choreography and nothing too strenuous that I could use to get me going in the mornings. This DVD was just the shot. On days when I really can't be bothered exercising I will do one of the workouts knowing that it won't take too long, and on days when I feel more energetic I will do both. Warning: the moves are simple and very repetitive. That works for me when I'm tired in the mornings and just want to do some exercise before work without having to think too much, but it may be too boring for a lot of people.",1191196800,4,556,4.110091743119266
2657978,5,B000IJ7A0G,"Since walking is highly recommended by doctors and exercise gurus, this production by Ms. Rocker provides the exerciser with a 2 well-instructed walks.  New exercisers can either follow the full workout in the AM or PM section or the new exercisers can follow the modifications presented.  Neither walk is difficult and all exercisers look pleased to be out walking in the beautiful outdoors.  Recommended workouts.",1178928000,13,415,5.3538461538461535
2657979,3,B000IJ7A0G,"I was really looking forward to trying these new walking workouts - the AM & PM Walking workout really left me disappointed, but maybe it was just me.  I really enjoy Leslie Sansone's walking workouts - I also enjoy the occasional George Foreman walk, and I do like Kathy Smith's new power walk.  This one, though, was just a little ...... boring.  The AM walk is supposed to be slow, to wake you up and get you going in the morning.  Well, I need something a little less repetitive, a little less lethargic, and a lot more energetic, to get me going!  The roughly five-minute warmup was simply marching in place with absolutely no variation whatsoever while Debbie talked about how she would be your coach, etc.  I finally had to do my own thing - side steps, mambo steps, etc., just because I couldn't wait for her to do something new.  The PM walk was slightly better, but only slightly.  The scenery, however, was absolutely gorgeous - much better than the movie screen outdoor setting employed by Kathy Smith, and a nice change of pace from the indoor studio-setting walks used by both Leslie and George.",1168819200,23,1109,4.593908629441624

2657991,4,B000IJ7A0G,I have done that a.m. workout several times and really enjoy it.  It gives a good sweat and does take too long.  I have tried some of the dance-style programs and I just couldn't get the hang of the movements.  This is easy to follow.  I have yet go try the p.m. walk.  I don't understand the CD workout and no longer have  Walkman.  I will have to put.into my home stereo and give it a listen but I don't quite understand the.inclusion .  I liked this so much I bought 2 other of her workout DVDs.,1396310400,,498,4.061855670103093
2657992,5,B000IJ7A0G,Love the whole series!  She is great at giving you a good workout.  Nice variety and very encouraging.  Works for the novice and the experienced.,1361577600,,145,4.72
2657993,4,B000IJ7A0G,"It's not the most exciting walking dvd I've ever done, but I do enjoy it. I wish there were a little less ""marching"" exercises, as others have said, and I also wish it were a little longer. But the scenery is just beautiful and I find it fun and effective enough. I do find myself using this dvd often.",1345420800,,302,4.135593220338983
2657994,2,B000IJ7A0G,"The first half of the AM workout is mostly marching in place. The moves got more interesting in the 2nd half, but it was way too much walking in place. I don't think I'll ever do this workout again.",1334275200,,198,4.102564102564102
2657995,3,B000IJ7A0G,"So far, I've only watched the PM walking segment.  The scenery is lovely.  The movements sometimes go on for way too long (such as the arm swinging, from low to high).  Debbie says ""nice"" at least 20 times, and ""good"" for just as many.  I found myself counting the nices and goods instead of concentrating on the walking.",1322697600,,321,4.482758620689655
2657996,4,B000IJ7A0G,"I'm 58 and though a lot overweight, I've exercised off and on my whole life so not that physically unfit. I bought this DVD to try to get back into shape, again, and lose weight, again. I'm a serial exercise quitter--I get bored with one thing and move on to the next. I agree with other reviewers that Rocker's cuing leaves something to be desired. Until you get used to it, it seems she's cuing way too soon. And yes, she doesn't count you down to the next move (except once), though she usually does indicate that she's making the change to the next move in ""4,"" and if you can't count down from 4 to 1 yourself, you probably shouldn't be moving while watching a DVD anyway. The music is the kind that if played in any other setting would make me want to put a gun to my head (or to the screen): It's frenetic, with so many beats that if I listen to it too closely, I get confused (I didn't say I was coordinated: I'm not). So instead I keep the audio on low enough so I can hear Rocker but not too much of the music and just glance every so often at the screen to help me keep in time, then glance away. Why am I rating this DVD 4 stars? Because I actually LIKE that Rocker talks non-stop. What she's saying (when she's not cuing too soon) is some really positive stuff, about thinking of yourself as an athlete in training, and going into (or out of) your day with self-respect and a can-do attitude. This is just what I need to keep me going. The power of these words is awesome: It keeps my mind off of the negative tapes I tend to run in my head when I'm working out, about how bored I am or how much my feet hurt or how much time I've got left, or I have to pee, or whatever. The workout is just enough to help get my metabolism moving without me feeling like someone beat the heck out of me later in the day or the next morning, which would eventually discourage me. I think I can keep going with this (this is *not* the feeling I usually have when I begin other workouts), and I can see ways of increasing the intensity (with arm or leg weights) to keep the workout physically challenging once I'm back in better shape. Right now, I can do the workout easily enough, but it gets me sweating, and afterwards I have this nice buzz and feel great about myself. I also like that this is a twice-a-day workout, 30 energizing minutes each stint, which I can manage to fit into the busiest of days. A great bonus: I sleep really well after I do the P.M. stint.",1253145600,13,2464,4.135416666666667
2657997,2,B000IJ7A0G,"I'm new to walking for exercise, and thought this would be perfect, not intimidating. Well, the a.m walking is supposed to wake you up, and get you going, it was a level away from putting me to sleep! I never did get my heart rate up. The moves and the music were boring. She hardly ever gave a ""count"", so it was difficult to follow at times. The only great thing about this DVD is the scenery. If you're into yoga, you may like this DVD, otherwise look for something else.",1249084800,,474,4.21978021978022
2657998,2,B000IJ7A0G,"This DVD was just too repetitive, marching, marching, marching. Mind you, I've done countless walking workouts using Leslie Sansone and Madeleine Lewis's workouts, both of which are varied, challenging, and fun.

This one was just boring. Too much marching, not enough other moves, and Debbie talks SO much. Wow. I mean, maybe she was nervous but she was talking, it seemed, just for the sake of talking.",1222646400,3,404,5.029850746268656
2657999,5,B000IJ7A0G,"This video and audio cd set are enjoyable, make you sweat and get you into shape.  It is the only way to start your day and a great way to end it.  It is fun, obtainable and you see results.  I have been following along with the dvd 5 days a wk since early Feb. 2008.  I have lost 18 lbs. and many inches in my waist, toned my arms and toned my legs.  My energy level is up, my outlook on life is much happier and my kids, friends and husband notice how I look and act.  Thank you Debbie for making this incredible life changing dvd set.  Only 10 more lbs. to go.  Its a new me!  Everyone, my kids, my friends and my 75 year old mother have become hooked on the dvd.",1207353600,4,666,3.838235294117647
