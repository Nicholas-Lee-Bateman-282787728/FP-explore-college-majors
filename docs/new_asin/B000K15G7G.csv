2681104,5,B000K15G7G,Jason Issacs was wonderful as Mark.  Some times I wanted to ring his neck because he didn't seem to know what was going on around him.  Sharon Gless played her roll well.,1174348800,,170,4.28125
2681105,5,B000K15G7G,"What an amazingly intelligent, well-written, and well-acted series.  Seeing Sharon Gless back on the screen was as exciting as the show itself.  Why this woman isn't making Oscar-winning films or starring in an excellent series is a mystery.  She was and is one of our best female actors.",1171929600,4,288,4.958333333333333
2681106,5,B000K15G7G,"Take the adrenalin from 24 and put it in the world of diplomacy and world politics - you get The State Within. Energy and drive throughout the whole series, and with shocking opening.",1171065600,9,183,4.575757575757576
2681107,5,B000K15G7G,"A cracking political thriller with most of the action Washington based and involving governments, private companies and perhaps predictably, a small oil-rich Asian country (Trygyzstan, Tyrgyztan or Tyrygsztan depending how quick your eyes are) so the events are very contemporary and mostly credible, too.

The 350 minutes get off to a stunning start with an airliner being blown up and crashing onto an expressway near Washington and from this point on you'll be hooked like I was.  Considering this is not big bucks Hollywood the crash looked incredibly convincing, as does everything else though it was mostly filmed in Toronto and Hamilton, Ontario.

The six parts move along efficiently, especially with plenty of steadycam and accompanying sound effects, but you'll have to pay attention because this is not black and white plotting, the good guys are not obvious and there is no winning side.  The casting is fine with Jason Isaacs turning in a great British Ambassador and perhaps Sharon Gless should be taken on by Department of Defence as their no-nonsense Secretary (but maybe her hands are tainted, too).  Nothing is what it seems at first.

The UK DVD release includes a twenty-seven minute 'making of' extra.  Worth a look though it is the usual back slapping stuff.  Several minutes are devoted to creating the airliner crash, which I thought were interesting and Grainne Marmion has some good comments on how she interpreted the production.

This is a conspiracy thriller that will certainly be worth watching several times.",1170547200,98,1540,5.152610441767068
2681108,5,B000K15G7G,"The State Within is a roller coaster ride of a conspiracy thriller. Set in the present, it uses drama to inform and entertain us. The cast is outstanding, led by the much under rated British Actor, Jason Isaacs. This 6 part series starts out with a bang (bomb blows up a british airliner over washington dc), and then immerses us in the political world of the british ambassador, politicians, foreign policy between countries, and private companies as investors in our future. I found this absorbing and interesting, and could not wait to see each episode. The script treats the audience as if we are intelligent, concerned public. Not only entertaining, this series will make you think about the daily news that you read and watch on tv. How much of the truth do we actually have reported to us? How truthful are our politicians, locally and nationally? Absorbing and gripping, I highly recommend this thriller to anyone who has wondered about our future as a country, and a planet. Terrorism is as much a concern today as is global warming and international policies.",1170374400,9,1069,4.8469945355191255
2681109,5,B000K15G7G,"A fantastic 6-part mini-series that stylistically, is a lot like the BBC series, MI-5/Spooks. Part 1 was rather convoluted as a lot of characters were introduced, and many plot threads were as well. But the fun is in finding out how they are connected and come together. You may feel like you don't know what is going on but you will be hooked. And it will be very hard not to watch parts 3 - 6 back to back as the conspiracy unravels with many turns and twists to keep you guessing right to the end.

Leading a great cast, Jason Isaacs is excellent as the British ambassador, especially when he goes head to head with Sharon Gless's formidable Secretary of Defense. Other standouts were Lennie James as death row convict Luke Gardner, and Marnie McPhail as FBI agent George Blake.",1169078400,12,781,4.539007092198582
2681110,5,B000K15G7G,"I haven't seen this yet, but have read every review I can find on-line about this show and am just chomping at the bit to get to look at it.

We haven't had a leader suggest defending the US in over 20 yrs. The leaders since then would be blaming the US for provoking the group that killed all these innocents and get on national tv and apologize. The only message we send now is 'Whatever happens to us, its our fault. We deserve it'.

2681149,1,B000K15G7G,"As longtime fans of ""MI5,"" we thought we'd enjoy State Within.  However, it's very hard to follow: It's very fast paced, people speak quickly, the hand-held camera work is tiring, and most of the protagonists all look alike (dark suits, short hair, white) so it's hard to keep them separate.  We gave up after three episodes, when we had no idea of what was going on.  I guess one could keep a spreadsheet and keep pausing and rewinding to take notes, but it simply didn't seem worth it.",1418947200,2,487,4.511363636363637

2681151,2,B000K15G7G,"This could have been an excellent story; however, it is not.  The main reason is that it is very disjointed as it tries to weave
too many story lines together and because of this just winds up jumping around and becoming unintelligible.  Every time you
think you have a handle on the story line - it just shifts into something else.  These days filmmakers want to make movies that are slick and
appeal to the ""younger generation"" using speed and gimmicks -- but the truth is that any film you make must tell a good story that makes sense -- and to do that you need to develop the action along lines that the audience can comprehend.

In order to understand ""State Within"" you need to be on drugs.",1418860800,,696,4.372093023255814

2681163,5,B000K15G7G,"Unabashedly a Jason Isaacs fan, I was first drawn to this because of his leading role as a ""good guy,"" but secondarily because I very much appreciate the entire Brit mystery-political-spy-thriller genres (loved MI-5 series, and mini-series ""The Last Enemy."" )

I also appreciate that the setting is DC, a great foundation for the intrigues of the industrial-military complex and the international power struggles to be found in our nation's capitol. This drama is so very well done in every aspect from the concept, through the script, direction, acting, editing It's smart, incisive, and at times an edge of the seat thriller.  The casting and consequent chemistry between the characters is excellent.  It is an excellent example of the weaving of several strong story-lines and the interconnectedness of the characters/plots/betrayals/conspiracies and climax.enough said.",1417824000,,873,5.548872180451128

Then it pans to a big morgue and then it almost ends with the governor of Virginia doing something that would never happen, just rounding up only Muslims with British Passports in Virginia and then ends or when I could not watch anymore a British homosexual working for the British embassy ""gets it on"" with an American homosexual working for the Secretary of Defense.  Amazon and the BBC seem to have to have a Homosexual sex scene every chance they can get even if it is not related to the story.  According to the BBC and Amazon, homosexual guys are getting it on with whoever and whenever they can do it.  But anyone knows with half a political brain that even heterosexual sexual connections at this level of government officials is a big no-no.  So why does BBC and Amazon got to put in a homosexual seen during their first episode?

It is too bad with great acting and storytelling.  This series could be very entertaining and maybe even enlightening along the way.  But it become unbelievable during the first episode and has to start off with a sex scene between government individuals and unbelievable political actions by a governor of a state of the United States.  Maybe the British are right, this uniting of states with their own sovereignty is as the British Ambassador stated to the Secretary of Defense, ""Obscene.""",1413072000,,1459,4.66796875

My husband always gets cold feet when a program is really intense with danger lurking at every turn and his feet were cold through the whole series.

Ben Daniels as MI6 agent and assistant to UK Ambassador was great casting: totally believable, lovely to watch and so British.  Mamie McPhail was George Blake, an FBI Special Agent which she portrayed with dignity and a bit of fun.

Out of nowhere, two main characters were fully making out, I mean two MEN characters were FULLY making out. Turned my stomach and I turned it off as quickly as I could get to my remote. I deleted it from my watch list. Amazon should include ""Homosexual Content"" as a warning , just as they should for profanity, nudity, and the like. For the unsuspecting average moral ""Joe"" or ""Jane"", this is still shocking and unwanted television ""entertainment""!

2681378,3,B000K15G7G,"A little ""too much"" to be believable but good acting. Would might have gotten more stars if there were NOT so much gratuitous ""gay"" sex. It seems that every little program just HAS to have homosexuality ""in your face"" just to satisfy the Hollyweird types.  No doubt that it happens, but then male/female (the normal way of sex) often has some kinkily parts, but that's not shown, and doesn't need to be shown either.  Why can't writers just write stories, plays, movies and TV dramas without forcing deviancy on the public. And, before I'm accused of ""gay bashing"" (or something worse) I have a homosexual brother, but I don't ask him about his sex life and he doesn't' ask me about mine.  It's a shame that, at most, 2% to a max of 5% of the general public is homosexual, but ""the movie"" industry is not satisfied with letting it be known, they want approbation of their lives and deviancy. Ain't gonna happen. But the damage to the younger generation by portraying homosexuality as ""normal"" will have great damage on our society. I may not watch any more of this, or other series, if they keep pushing their ""lifestyle"" agenda.",1390953600,,1129,4.635

The story develops carefully in the beginning. I felt compelled to watch the first 3 episodes just to get a gist of how the characters meshed and how these diverse sub-plots would converge. The good guys and the bad guys are not clearly defined in the beginning (other than the British ambassador, clearly our tragic hero). Plot twists and great cinematography are very satisfying. Excellent entertainment overall.",1384732800,,618,5.585106382978723

However, unlike many movies or series like this, it kept picking up the pace and the drama as the links between the different parties became more clear. I thoroughly enjoy films of this sort, and The State Within had solid dialogue that was delivered well by quality actors. Moreover, everything fit together at the end. Suspense was sustained at a realistic pace, and at the completion of each episode I was very ready to move onto the next. Overall very entertaining.",1384300800,,626,4.743119266055046

2681431,4,B000K15G7G,"If you like political thrillers you will probably like this one, which seems to have been 'ripped from the headlines', involving political conspiracy and intrigue at the highest levels of British/US government. The story is complicated but if you pay attention you will not need a scorecard. But be forewarned: this is a TV miniseries. It is not a movie. It was not made with a huge budget. It is not in the same league as The Constant Gardener...The Bourne Identity....either Manchurian Candidate....even the original Tinker, Tailor.

This is one of my pet peeves--maybe this stuff doesn't bug you--but the people who made it suffer from the same afflictions that so many modern film/TV directors/cinematographers exhibit: shaking camera (to suggest ""You Are There"" cinema verite, but it just comes off as pretentious and fake), gigantic closeups of parts of people's faces (to suggest great emotion, but really a cheap device to fill time and also to disguise the fact that they had no ideas/time/money to arrange a credible or creative shot), and microcutting of action scenes (filling the screen with blurry objects and cutting the shots so quickly that we barely can see what is happening). It is really a pity that this lazy and hackneyed kind of filmmaking is so rampant these days. The first Bourne movie was great, but by the time the third one came out, the frenetic cutting and closeups and jerky camera had gotten so out of control that it was almost unwatchable. But there have been other great TV miniseries that do not exhibit these horrible traits, e.g. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy with Sir Alec. OK, rant over.

That said, I did enjoy this series. I think the writing was pretty good, very relevant and fairly credible. However, it's a bit tough to buy the premise that so many evil people are aligned out there, their sole purpose being to make heaps of dough via the creation of phony wars. But then again.....what about Blackwater??

The acting throughout is very solid. It was interesting to once again see Sharon Gless of Cagney & Lacey, who is now playing the matronly but tough-as-nails Secretary of Defense. The fine work and strong presence of Jason Isaacs makes me wonder why he was not considered for James Bond (he is outstanding in everything he does....Case Histories and Brotherhood are excellent). The always engaging and charismatic Lennie James from Snatch, The Walking Dead and Low Winter Sun is on hand, playing the unfortunate scapegoat Luke Gardner. I won't even try to outline the plot; suffice it to say it involves an act of terrorism designed to incite a war with one of the 'stans', this one the fictional country of Tyrgystan (isn't that situated right next to Kazakhstan--a real country--and home of the immortal Borat?). Most folks gave it four or five stars, and I'd agree, so it's well worth watching. One of the main distinguishing factors in a smart and well-written series is unpredictability; if it keeps us guessing, then it's much more rewarding and entertaining. This is such a series.

I found the ending to be disturbingly abrupt. Truly it almost seems as if they ran out of time or money and said, ""geez, Jason has three other projects coming up,...we've gotta wrap this thing up NOW....so let's tie up as many loose ends as we can, kill off the bad guys, and if we leave a few people or situations dangling, that's too bad!"" Quite honestly I thought there had to be another episode, an episode 7, which must be on a third disk. To clear up confusion, there are two disks, three episodes on each disk. That is it, the complete series. HOWEVER, if you watch it on streaming Netflix, there are not six but SEVEN episodes. The thing is, if you watch the streaming version, you won't be seeing anything different from the disks version; it's just that they shortened each episode for the streaming version, for some reason, and made seven episodes out of six.",1383523200,,3915,4.812778603268945

2681462,4,B000K15G7G,"I tend to view favorite movies and series I really like often.  This was the first time I watched and re-watched this series.  The pace of the events happen quickly.  It was the third program in the series that hooked me.  The first two programs set up the story, and when re-watching the series I saw a lot I missed during the first viewing.  I won't be surprise to find that I missed other details when I view it again.  I thought the series was well done.  I would view a second series with the same characters, if it were available.  I have to admit I liked the main character, but wondered why he would do what I would consider 'stupid things' which have disastrous results.  The answer must be 'emotions and logic are strange bedfellows'.  The series provided some surprises for me.  I would describe it as taut and entertaining.  I viewed all of the programs twice over two days.",1379548800,,886,4.434782608695652

2681468,5,B000K15G7G,I particularly liked the British take on American politics viewed from a British ambassador to the US.  It was well done and a compelling story that keeps you interested.

2681470,3,B000K15G7G,"Others may prefer the high concept action flick, but I had higher hopes for The State Within. With a title like that, the film might have been an exploration of the personalities and competing interests involved in government, but it quickly disintegrated into a political shoot-em-up. Character development was nil, and events happened without apparent reason. I may be an old guy, but the action ought to develop from character, not from some producer's idea of the kind of story that will get the most eyeballs.",1377734400,,514,4.988372093023256

2681480,1,B000K15G7G,"The only bright light here is Jason Issacs who is a fine actor caught in a silly, contrived series.  Otherwise the acting is stilted; the characters are stereotyped; the writing is disjointed; and the plot is just plain stupid.

Perhaps worst of all is the question of whether this is really the way BBC sees the US: as a bunch of whacko, xenophobic, racist jerks run by sleazy politicians intent only on preserving their power.  The US has many problems but this is hardly the dominant culture.  Indeed the opposite is closer to the truth.  The country continues to struggle with finding the right balance between defense from real terrorist threats and its traditional sense of fairness.  This is a balance that the UK is also trying to find...and, it seems to me, with less success than the US.  While this series may appeal to those who harbor BBC's bizarre and distorted view, a more complex depiction is called for but is not to be found here.",1375142400,10,949,4.6467065868263475

2681486,5,B000K15G7G,"Very believable! I like the choice of actors; along with well- written script. I thought they did a marvelous job of holding our attention with one event after another. Surprises were in abundance, therefore we were having trouble waiting for the next episode. If I didn't like anything: it would be the fact that it was not long enough for me. Once I get into a good story, I enjoy it for some time. The characters were portrayed up close and personal. I am currently watching another series: Prime Suspect. In It, the characters are again vividly portrayed. I've not seen this as much in other movies. I would certainly would like to more series like these two.",1373414400,,663,4.627118644067797

2681488,4,B000K15G7G,I had watched an episode of this show when it originally aired and was interested in seeing the whole thing.

2681489,5,B000K15G7G,"This is fun and very twisted.

What I mean is this.... We are used to suspenseful stories, thrillers, set from the American perspective. This is from British, European perspective of a thriller set in the US.

America is shown in a positive light, but for once some of the warts are shown as well.

The British are shown to be the main characters, and the heroes, in the way the US is usually shown in American made shows. So it's an interesting perspective.

I love the character development. And I love that it's made smartly and often is subtle. You aren't,t always hit over the head with the plot-for-dummies method of story telling. I have seen this series 3-4 times now and always enjoy it.

It does get a bit heavy handed in showing British opposition to the death penalty, although I tend to agree with the view. It also shows a couple very masculine and strong characters in a gay male relationship. And that is unusual for American TV. But it's handled like any relationship is handled, it's normal. And that is great. We need more well rounded films that show all manner of normal people doing all manner of normal things even if they happen not to be white and heterosexual and American. I mention it because that is rare on American TV.

Love the series. Great writing and filming.",1372636800,,1294,4.556034482758621

2681502,3,B000K15G7G,"I just finished watching the first episode, and at first blush goes it's not so bad.  A lot of times television dramas start off slow, not introducing enough characters or conflict. That's definitely not happening here.

One major problem I have is with the plot's believably, and yeah, the portrayal of America.  The manic disregard for human rights, the silly reaction of the Defense Secretary (""PUT TANKS AT THE AIRPORT!!1""), and the homogeneous and apathetic attitude of all the Americans, those things were pretty obviously written by someone who has a scrubbed understanding of US politics.  Still, it's a nice break from the fat/stupid stereotype, so I can get past all that.

Helps to think of it as BBC payback for the Austin Powers series.

I'll give it a 3, I'm going to watch another episode.",1368403200,,804,4.875

2681507,5,B000K15G7G,This is a British short TV thriller set in the US.  A great 'dish' on US paranoia on 'terrorists.'  A painful look at the US justice system and the death penalty.  The cast is excellent.  The plot line is complex and the action never stops.,1367020800,,240,4.266666666666667

However the series so oversimplified the way decisions are made at the highest level of the U.S. government---reducing the decision-making process of entire departments to the maneuverings of two or three individuals---that the strategies and subterfuges seemed to depend upon personal relationships rather than well-formulated organizational plans with inputs from multiple interested parties. If you can get over the simplification and treat it as a parlor game, then there are some quite interesting characters some of whom get to develop and ""learn"" from experience. On the other hand, there are some scenes involving the British ambassador in which ""His Excellency's"" stern exterior is dissolved by the heat of animal passion which, one assumes, his training and stiff upper lip would have better prepared him to resist.",1363824000,,1115,5.377142857142857

We only watched season one of The State Within recently, despite the fact that it originally aired in 2006. It has aged well because we had no idea we weren't watching a current BBC series.

Little by little, more of the machinations and motivations are revealed, and we struggle along with those portrayed in the series to unravel the story and the perpetrators behind the frightening events in the series (including the plane crash).

2681547,5,B000K15G7G,"THE STATE WITHIN is a six episode series from BBC that has class, excellent writing, top notch acting and enough twists and turns of story line to keep the viewer on the edge of the seat for the six hours it plays. Written by Michael Offer and Daniel Perceval (who also directs 3 of the episodes while Lizzie Mickery directs 3 others) the script is tight, the pacing deliberately fast, and the insertion of new characters into almost every episode serves not as distracting but as additive suspense.

Mark Brydon (Jason Isaacs in one of his finest roles) is the British Ambassador to the United States. The series opens with the explosion of an airplane over Dulles International Airport in Washington DC and Brydon must respond to what appears to be a terrorist plot. But who is the terrorist and who is the country behind the plot?  Brydon is supported by his undersecretary Nicholas Brocklehurst (Ben Daniels, also wholly convincing in a tough role) and they must face the US government in the person of Secretary of Defense Lynne Warner (Sharon Gless, proving that she is a fine dramatic actress) and her undersecretary Christopher Styles (the always superb Noam Jenkins). There are clues that unravel slowly, fingers that point to a small Middle Eastern country, currently beset by political problems, not the least of which involve American corporate gains.  Informers and witness are knocked off right and left and there are intelligence issues in both the British and the US camps that play on the concepts that Warner is financially involved in the plot and Brydon is compromised by a relationship that is related to the little country's dilemma.  It is a rush to the finish to resolve all the subterfuge and it is played out very well by a large cast of excellent actors.  One comment should be made about this BBC production: as opposed to films made in this country: there is a frank and well acted same sex encounter between Brocklehurst and Styles in the first episode that sets the pace for the tenor of the story. No items of personal business are left unnoticed in this manipulation of information and the extremes that can be taken.  While it is a suspense thriller, there is a lot of space for very real interpersonal relationships to unfold.  Highly recommended entertainment, with special kudos to BBC for having the courage to explore topics so stringently avoided by American films.

First, they misstate what the ""Patriot Act"" says, but so do most leftists. They claim it gives a governor (beginning of second episode) the ability to detain people by ethnicity on a wide scale. WRONG!!  Only a moron believes this, and only a person who wants this to be true would put this in a story - much less a movie.

Second, the gov. of West Virginia takes the action of rounding up muslims (how they they have a ready list to do this is left to the leftist with odd beliefs), but we are also shown a state sign from Virginia (a different place) which has (a different motto) a motto of ""Virginia is for Lovers"". How this adds to the story is - I dunno. . . ask a nutcase leftist.

Third, no Gov. wanted to round up muslims after ""911"". . . no one.

Fourth, President Bush, who was the President at the time of 911, repeatedly said muslims and Islam are not the enemy. That was the policy of his administration. The USA did not attack anyone because they were muslim or of the islamic faith. They attacked for other reasons.

Fifth, If an American of any denomination had blown up a plane in England, the so called honorable mayor of London would have had a cow. . . Oh, wait, a bomb did go off, and he made love to . . .

Myriad subplots, subtexts, & a vast array of betrayals & human duplicity are illustrated throughout this thoughtful, and all-too-plausible story.  Every performer was diamond sharp in his/her role.

I was happy that she autographed it for me a couple of weeks ago, as she was appearing here in San Francisco in A Round Heeled Woman.

2681560,5,B000K15G7G,"Such political fiction is flabbergasting. War has become a business in the hands of private interests. Armed and security forces have been privatized and today companies deal with war in order to make a profit out of it. They can't succeed without the right politicians in the right places, but that is always easy to get if these politicians are demagogical enough to flatter public opinion and to manipulate events to create the proper public opinion among the people, a public opinion they can easily use in order to move to the war they need to make some hefty profit. Who cares about the many million people that may die in the process. Actually they will get into the undertaking business to make a profit on the casualties too. That is the first interest of this miniseries. But there is plenty more. If the state can be colonized by the death peddlers, what happens internationally and hence to diplomacy? Diplomacy becomes, from that point of view, the right way to assassinate the right people after trapping them in some cage. A plane for instance that will be exploded at the right time and at the right moment to cause the horror and hate these businessmen need. Too bad for the victims who are not innocent in the eyes of these war mongers because innocence is cowardice and blindness and that is from this point of view the worst guilt you can imagine, unconscious guilt, the guilt of playing innocent, because that can only be a game, an illusion, a make believe. Throw all the innocent people in the world down some kind of chute without a parachute. Flush the world of all these cowards who may, if they are not manipulated, prevent a war, stop a plot, invert a scheme, a malefic scheme of course. But the film goes slightly further than that cynicism. Some people and even forces are against these plotters known as the neo-conservatives today, the Nazis some seventy years ago. The aim of these people and these forces who do not want to use war to benefit the petty interest of a few and to impose death and suffering to the vast majority of the people is always vastly insufficiently articulated and un-enlightened because too much is out of their reach. Some believe the state is the power OF the people FOR the people BY the people, but they have to bring hard evidence to convince the decision-makers to stop the plotters who do not need that kind of evidence since they use the gut reactions of the people moved by the sensational news brought to them by the media. And to get that hard evidence you have to get down into the gutters of life, down into the sewage of hatred, down into the darkest seepage of the endocrinal perspiration of the money-aiming egocentric criminals that are driven by both fear and greed. The film shows marvelously how the real manipulators at the top of the plot, or at the bottom if your prefer, are moved constantly by greed that is unspeakable and the fear that this greed  nourishes, nurtures and grows in their logic that knows the profit of this greed might be denied at any time. They turn paranoid because of their greed and they start making mistakes. Politicians in that field are slightly more complex because they become addicted by being under the influence of their ambition to take power, to keep power and use power in order to satisfy their vengeance somewhere, their lust for power somewhere else and their total disregard for others everywhere because they are locked up in their schizophrenia, but a schizophrenia that has managed to get rid of the positive side of the double or triple personality and that has only retained the negative megalomaniac side of it. They may even think they are inspired by some god, that they may be, that they are god himself, or herself, who cares, since after all he or she may be gay. A diplomat then has only one advantage in that situation: he is covered by some real security, independence and freedom and he can use that to get to the root of the evil and to manage the truth to come out. And yet he cannot protect all his friends, all his associates, who will be seen as accomplices if he fails, and who are the first targets for the plotters. The film yet is optimistic somewhere, maybe even nave. Yes the warmongers were stopped before they could enter Iran. But the war mongers are still here and are still plotting. They even use all kinds of social or ethnic problems in the world to put those who would oppose their ambition ill at ease and in a difficult situation. Even the present economic crisis is used in that direction, and now those who were supposed to suffer most are getting through, not unharmed but unscathed, they try to get things back on rails and move to another provocation, who knows what. They used Al Qaeda in Afghanistan against the Soviets and they are ready to use, and they have already vastly infiltrated them, Al Qaeda tomorrow anywhere it could be useful to block those who are not playing their game, to impose havoc and chaos anywhere they can. They will even manipulate elections in order to bring social upheaval here and electoral discredit there. It is the state within. This film is a masterpiece because it shows western private companies are hiring mercenaries in one western country in  order to destabilize and manipulate another western country in order to get the war they want in some far away oil heaven and underdeveloped country. Only the BBC can come up with such political fiction.

2681565,4,B000K15G7G,"""The State Within"" is a pleasing thriller on just about every count.  The acting is good (especially Jason Isaacs as Sir Mark Brydon, British ambassador to the U.S.; Ben Daniels as Nicholas Brocklehurst, British spyguy; Eva Birthistle as Jane Lavery, civil rights attache at the British embassy; and Marnie McPhail as FBI agent George Blake--she's particularly impressive).  The script and plot are good:  intricate, brainy, but not impossibly so.  The cinematography is good.  And the basic premise of the show--that it's frequently in corporate and political interests to start wars--is all too true, as recent events have sadly shown.

In addition to all this, it can hardly be denied that the BBC is taking a poke at the Bush administration in ""The State Within.""  Instead of a vice president pulling strings and manipulating world events behind the scenes, the film makes the Secretary of Defense, hard as nails Lynn Warner (ably played by Sharon Gless), the eminence grise.  But as the story unfolds, viewers discover that there are powers manipulating her as well, putting a new and frightening spin on Eisenhower's valedictory warning against the military industrial complex.

A few earlier reviewers dismissed ""The State Within"" as a bit of U.S. baiting.  But, notwithstanding the thinly veiled allusions to Vice Presdient Cheney, this strikes me as a rather unreflective analysis.  As a major world power, the U.S. certainly takes a centerstage position in the film.  But the theme is more about the abuse of power by international financial corporate interests than about nationalist imperialism.  In a day and age when such interests are at least as powerful as state governments, the message of ""The State Within"" is timely.",1230681600,7,1737,5.205035971223022

2681572,4,B000K15G7G,"While this lightning-paced, well-acted political thriller made for BBC America has one or two ""believability"" holes (the most prominent being a U.S. governor ordering the roundup of Muslims in Virginia, just because they ARE Muslims), overall it presents what some of us may suspect is a depressingly accurate description of behind-the-scenes ""realpolitik"" among major powers and corporate interests battling for hegemony in the oil-rich Middle East, with few moral inhibitions (make that NO moral inhibitions) about how they achieve their goal.

""The State Within"" is a thinly disguised portrayal of the events of 9/11 combined with a few lesser-known ones surrounding British and American covert operations in the Iraq/Uzbekistan region, and how these events led up to and made possible the invasion of Iraq - not for humanitarian reasons, but for coldly cynical strategic purposes centering on corporate opportunity and access to oil.  I wish I could say the scenario is ludicrous, but, unfortunately, it will probably resonate all too realistically in the aftermath of 9/11 and the Bush/Cheney invasion of Iraq.  For Iraq/Uzbekistan read the plot's ""Tyrgyzstan""; for Halliburton, read its ""Armitage""; and for Dick Cheney, former Halliburton CEO, read its ""Lynne Warner"", former CEO of ""Armitage"" and now the U.S. Secretary of Defense.

On a beautiful day, a passenger jet explodes over the Beltway in Washington, DC, killing all aboard, as well as many on the ground.  Caught on the ground in the middle of the incident is the U.S. ambassador from the Court of St. James, Sir Mark Brydon (Jason Isaacs, more familiar to American audiences as Malfoy, Sr., in the Harry Potter films).  Brydon quickly senses that there is more to this dreadful incident than raw terrorism.  As official and unofficial information flows in about the the event, its tentacles reach out to include British paramilitary groups operating in ""Tyrgyzstan"", a former paramilitary now on death-row, private corporate entities whose financial interests would be well-served by utilizing the terrorist attack for ""regime change"", and, of course, the interests of the US Department of Defense.  The picture that forms as the pieces come together is so heinously, murderously venal, that the cost to the conscience becomes too much even for Brydon's seasoned diplomat.

The many layers of this plot make it necessary to pay attention throughout, so this isn't something to accompany a Saturday afternoon nap.  It moves along extremely quickly, riding, for the most part, a tightly woven script and excellent performances, starting with Mr. Isaacs as a man whose essentially decent core is challenged beyond capacity by the latest ""compromise"" required by international diplomacy.  Isaacs, with his distinctive voice, piercing eyes, and intelligent persona, is excellent, conveying Brydon's transition from habitual conformity to dogged resistance.  Sharon Gless gives Lynne Warner, the corrupt Secretary of Defense, a familiar ruthless arrogance dressed up as ""patriotism""; Ben Daniels, the noted British stage actor, is intense as Brydon's aide, Nicholas Brocklehurst, whose loyalties are murky until the last chapter; and special mention must go to the moving performance of Lennie James as Luke Gardner, the death-row British ex-paramilitary, paying dearly for witnessing inconvenient truths.  Alex Jennings (the villainous Lord Mark of ""Wings of the Dove"") is sympathetic as James Sinclair, deeply involved in the rebel movement against strong man ""Usman"" of Tyrgyzstan, and father of Brydon's godson.  Eva Birthwhistle is earnestly courageous as British human rights, anti-death penalty activist Jane Lavery, whose struggle to save Gardner from execution puts her too close to what he knows.

I enjoyed this series immensely.  Despite its one or two ""incredulity moments"", this is quality television viewing for grownups, and this reviewer sat up well past midnight on a weeknight to watch it through, unable to turn it off.  It may not be the whole truth but it's bloody close enough to make you wonder glumly exactly what it is about ""civilization"" that's so civilized.",1205107200,12,4148,5.43613707165109

She is a take charge, ruthless and politically adept player. There is the tension between the U.S. and the U.K. when it is revealed that a British Muslim detonated the bomb, a British national on death row in Florida, a secret training camp for paid mercenaries, corporately funded hitmen, attempts on Sir Mark's life.

It's a pleasure to be drawn into a tightly woven thriller that in each hour throws more and more and more detail into the mix, but therein is my only complaint - the intricate maze of relentless detail, coming at you like confetti at times, allows no time for the viewer to ponder or even catch up. The layers of simultaneous events and cross-contaminating characters will exhaust you, but pay off in the end.

I find it odd that a number of reviewers complain that this is a preposterous story, obviously using their trusting perceptions of how the US and British governments have behaved in the latest invasion of Iraq.

2681577,4,B000K15G7G,"surprisingly good! especially  given the usual political conspiracy drivel dished-out now a days in the form of the likes of 24 and the unit.

An intelligent political thriller drawn from the current geopolitical landscape, straight from the headlines, with the British ambassador to the United States, beautifully played by Jason Isaacs, as the central character.

The series takes place in the post Iraq era US and begins with a deadly explosion upon a passenger airliner on route form DC to London  attributed to a British born Islamic terrorist with links to an oil rich Central Asian country.
The first episode plays out the expected hysterical American over-reaction to the incident and the ambassador's frantic attempts at preaching restraint to a zealot secretary of defense played by Sharon Gless and a reactionary congress.
So far the plot follows the lines of countless TV and Cinema productions but then a corner is turned in the second episode and you are formally introduced to a death row inmate, a disgraced ex-British ambassador, a CEO of a major American corporation and the chairman of a private security company. From that point onward the series becomes ""a join the dots-what if"" review of all those articles you've read in the New Yorker, the Guardian and the Independent over the past few years, plotted by  Agatha Christi and paced by James Bond.

Both thrilling and surprising The State Within will engage you to the very last moment. The relevance and complexity of the material will negate the need for suspension of disbelief and hinder any early conclusions. While a stellar performance by Jason Isaacs gives what could have easily been a pantomime cut-out a human dimension that will both inspire and move you.

2681583,4,B000K15G7G,"""The State Within"" is an intelligent, well-acted, entertaining political thriller. What it is not is a diatribe against the United States. Having read reviews claming that it was, I watched ""The State Within"" with some trepidation. One review said that, with the exception of the death row prison guard, the Americans were all one-dimensional villains. Not true. There were good Americans and bad Americans in the film, just as there were good British characters and bad British characters.

The film does make the point that, in politics, even choosing the better (most moral) choice can lead to unintended and even evil consequences. No one recognizes this better than Mark Brydon, the hero and clearly a good man. There are some veiled references to Iraq, so I supposed those individuals who firmly believe invading Iraq was the correct thing to do might take offense, but that still doesn't mean ""The State Within"" is anti-American.

The viewer does need to be patient with ""The State Within."" There's a fairly large cast of characters and it may take an episode or two to keep them all straight. I'm astounded by the reviewer who claimed to have the entire story figured out in half an hour. I'm not sure all the characters were even introduced by that point. The production as a whole is top-notch, and I especially enjoyed Eva Birthistle as Jane Lavery and Ben Daniels as Nicholas Brocklehurst. His character will keep you guessing for several episodes. Also outstanding was the actor who played the prison guard (not sure of his name), He has such an expressive face. Jason Isaacs gives a compelling performance as the lead character Mark Brydon. Ever since I saw him as Lucius Malfoy in the second Harry Potter movie I've found him to be a fascinating actor, and it was so enjoyable to see him play a hero for a change.",1183075200,35,1828,4.818471337579618

This is one of the few movies that I could not predict what was going to happen, who was on which side, and who was romantically involved and their motives. The state within is quite refreshing in this aspect. Usually within the first five minutes of a TV show I am able to guess not only what is going to happen during the episode but also most of the diaologue. This is not the case with The State Within. This mini-series,in my opinion was not long enough, and should be brought back to television as a regular show. It is that good. I can promise you one thing, this movie will make you think and it will keep you thinking long after episode 6 is over. It is well worth the money.

2681585,3,B000K15G7G,"I tracked this BBC miniseries down after reading rave reviews from several TV critics whose opinions I trust... It was not quite the Second Coming of ""The Wire"" that I'd been led to expect, but it was engaging enough that I watched it straight through in the course of a couple of nights.

The plot is a mish-mash of corporate/spy/powers-that-be assassination-thriller-terrorist dramas, well-trod terrain that is tackled with some degree of thoughtfulness, but not much subtlety, sort of like ""24"" with a Trans-Atlantic multilateralist agenda.  I do have problems with films where people act irrationally, and this one is packed with random, improbable action: the steely, volatile American Secretary Of Defense (played by Sharon Gless, of ""Cagney & Lacey"" fame) who backs all types of reactionary, repressive measures in the face of a resurgent terrorist threat; various corporate baddies who dispatch hit men willy-nilly, with little apparent concern that the trail of corpses will ever lead to their back door; two high-placed government officials (one American, one British) who manage to keep their illicit (and entirely unprofessional) relationship completely under wraps; a death-row inmate who sorrowfully accepts execution when he easily could have cleared his name and saved his life, a particularly silly murder frame-up...  Etc., etc.

Also, the script is peppered with overly-obvious references and allusions to the Iraq War debacle, and enacts a British wish-fulfillment fantasy of what could have happened if the UK had not backed the US in the illegal fiasco -- I'm as critical of the war as the next leftie pinko treehugger, but I still found the plot to be a bit too blunt and on-the-nose in this and many other regards.  Still, it's propulsive and engaging, and there are several fine acting performances that may catch your attention.  Jason Isaacs, as the embattled, virile British ambassador, is quite compelling -- James Bond as a career bureaucrat.  High marks go to Roman Padhora as a soulful prison guard who tries to save his ward on death row (he steals the picture with his Chris Cooper-esque mournfulness: I want to see more from this guy!) and to Marnie McPhail as a weatherbeaten, no-nonsense FBI agent, and finally to Ben Daniels as Nicholas Brockelhurst, an icy English spy whose loyalties are in question throughout the miniseries (adding a great deal of spice to the script), and who I would be pleased to see reappear in another drama.

If I could, I would rate this a 3.5; between a 3 and a 4, I guess I'd have to tilt a bit on the low end, just because of the piling-up of endless preposterous elements.  It's still fun TV, though.",1180569600,24,2670,5.02262443438914
2681586,4,B000K15G7G,"This certainly turned out to be a most satisfying alternative to the usual TV thrillers out there that rely on police procedure or crime solving.  Here, the lynch pin of the story is Sir Mark Dryden, the British Ambassador to the US, played by Jason Isaacs.  Frankly, this is probably the most effective role I have seen him in, and is certainly a world away from playing Lucius Malfoy in Harry Potter movies.

This is a truly British type of story, with dominantly British characters and with a complex plot.  However, it is set in America, featuring all the landmarks we would expect to see in an American thriller.. the West Wing, Lincoln Memorial, etc.  To add to the American mix, we even have a recognizable star of American TV - Sharon Gless, who completely casts aside her past in Cagney and Lacey here to embrace the role of Secretary of Defence with a real sense of grit.

Perhaps the most British aspect of this series is the underlying criticism of certain aspects of government - not least The Patriot Act which comes under fire along the way.  Certainly terrorism and its origins are at the very foreground of the action.

To reveal too much about the plot would be unfair, but in a nutshell, Sir Mark is caught up in a web of deceit when a plane leaving for London is blown up, apparently by terrorists.  Meantime, a Brit is on Death Row protesting his innocence.  Could the two be connected...?  Suffice to say many more plot strands arise, and interweave in a manner designed to satisfy and keep you glued to the end.

A 6 part mini-series, one hour per episode, was the perfect format for this thriller - instead of a rushed movie, the characters have enough time to develop and breathe, while the plot never slacks pace.

The only criticism to be made, is that they have followed the American model of TV making just a little too far with the ultra rapid editing and `24' style jump cuts.  There is enough thrill on the screen from the plot and the acting without this rather incongruous attempt at accentuating the kinetics - without this minor quibble, this would be a 5 star gem.",1180051200,7,2101,4.538461538461538

2681598,3,B000K15G7G,"This miniseries is a bizarre low-rent mix of 24, The West Wing, The Siege and a John Grisham death-row pulp thriller.

I tend to think of myself as fairly liberal, and I'm certainly not one who thinks that criticism of our country is automatically unpatriotic. Even so, this show ends up being hysterically anti-American for my taste. Every American character is a one-dimensional villain, except for a guilt-ridden death row guard. Isn't America barbaric with its death penalty? Isn't it a hypocritical imperialist black hole, espousing democracy while supporting brutal, totalitarian regimes? They're all valid, if tired points, but they're made in an amateurish and obvious way and without any alternative viewpoints. It's as racist as the stock Arab terrorists we're usually served on shows like 24. The fact that these stereotypes are novel doesn't make them any less repellant.

Beyond that, the biggest storytelling flaw is that we get a central hero (Isaacs) who doesn't actually do anything until the 5th of 6 episodes. He just listens endlessly to people describing the plot. I've never seen a thriller so loaded down by tedious exposition. It isn't even delivered during action, like on 24, but usually just between people sitting in an office. The plot ""twists"" are also glaringly obvious. Boy, do you think the guy on death row in the backwards American South will know something about the conspiracy? Will there be a race to get clemency from the governor? Will the rebel leader, seen standing in a park in DC in endless wide shots, with unknowing civilians all around be ""shockingly"" shot by a sniper? We also know from the very beginning of the series that Isaacs's and Gless's assistants are sleeping together and sharing their countries secrets. Much of the tension that might have been developed is destroyed by knowing they'll undo everything our ""heroes"" attempt. Every direction the plot takes has been done a thousand times on better shows.

The script also has American characters forever using British English, going to the ""washroom,"" instead of the bathroom, or being ""in hospital,"" instead of ""in the hospital"". Worse, simple factual errors creep in from every direction. Gless's character is constantly being called the ""Secretary of State for Defense"", or the ""Secretary for Defense."" The US has a Secretary OF Defense. We also get a ""Senate Defense Committee,"" when it's the Senate Armed Services Committee and a Security Council, when it's the National Security Council or the NSC. It would have taken all of five minutes on Google for the writers to do a bit of research.

In the end, what undermines the show most of all is the tremendous political naivet of the writers. After the governor of Virginia orders all British Muslims arrested and put in camps, our hero goes to the head of the Homeland Security Committee and makes a brief speech, filled with righteous British indignation about how wrong this is. Knowing she's a Jew, he asks if the Jews will be next. Shocked by the realization of how immoral this path is, she calls a halt to it. Had she not considered this before? Does she have some kind of mental problem that requires the obvious to be stated to her? This is an embarrassingly uneducated view of any political system and the whole show is like this.

I was a huge fan of Percival and Mickery's previous film, ""Dirty War,"" a powerfully sober thriller about the detonation of a dirty bomb in London's financial district. They handled a large canvas of characters much better there and with less shrill political grandstanding. Every minute of this show is infused with a ferocious anger at the US for selling Britain on the Iraq War. Again, it's a fair point, but unless you bury your message within entertainment, it just comes across as an angry person on a soapbox.

A note - the plot seems inspired by the true story of Craig Murray, former UK ambassador to Uzbekistan. Reading his book ""Murder in Samarkand"" (published as ""Dirty Diplomacy"" in the US) is a much better use of your time than watching this miniseries.",1174867200,13,4072,4.911337209302325

Jason Isaacs as Sir Mark Brydon,Ben Daniels as Nicholas Brocklehurst and Sharon Gless as Lynne Warner - U.S. Secretary of Defense all give outstanding performances and the plot holds on to you as it builds. Everything seems gray from the start, no good vs evil...the lines are blurred and you're never sure who is on what side. Well done and well worth the watch/",1516060800,2,593,4.4495412844036695

8153768,2,B000K15G7G,The story line was very difficult to follow.  Keeping the characters straight was too much work.  I didn't finish watching this one.,1481932800,,132,4.954545454545454
8153769,4,B000K15G7G,This comes as two DVDs.  DVD number one plays fine but DVD number two skips and hops and simply will not play.  Amazon immediately gave me a return label and a credit (gift certificate).  No complaints about Amazon or their partner who actually shipped the DVDs -- just bad luck the second DVD was defective.,1481068800,,308,4.5636363636363635
8153770,1,B000K15G7G,"My comment is not about the show. It's cryptic, but good. But even more cryptic because the streamed episodes are not in sync with the description. What is labeled episode 4 is episode 3. Can't figure out what I've missed so am resorting to BBC's episode summary to keep current. Rather maddening.",1480291200,,297,4.730769230769231

8153772,5,B000K15G7G,"This is a great series and has bearing on things that effect us all everyday. Secret government cover ups, assassinations, money power , ethics. I don`t think all of it is just coincidental . You may see resemblances of people in power today.",1465257600,,242,4.651162790697675
