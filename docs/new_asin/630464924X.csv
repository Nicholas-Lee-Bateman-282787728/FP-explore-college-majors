7875678,3,630464924X,"Way overrated, a fair movie but only reason is the special effects the first half-an-hour is boring, and there are parts of this movie that are so cheesy it makes you want to cringe in horror. The plot is about a guy who goes to the magical world of Wu Mountain and who is crazy about this girl.
my recommendation - watch this movie don't but it",974073600,3,345,4.164179104477612
7875679,4,630464924X,"Even die hard Hong Kong film fans will agree that this movie is a tad more ridiculous and cheesy than most. Still, even if the effects are dated and the plot is thin, it is all good fun. You are entertained from the first  scene to the last, and despite being almost twenty years old, the movie  holds up better than a majority of the early eighties fantasy movies. It  beats the hell out of Labryinth, Legend, and Big Trouble in Little China, a  film that sight Zu as its primary influence",943920000,4,490,4.293478260869565
7875680,5,630464924X,"The fantasy genre in Hong Kong received a fresh renovation with this, Tsui Hark's elaborate feature-length set piece upon which all others would be based.
No fantasy film since would be able to capture the allure of Zu:  Warriors From The Magic Mountain, although those that came close (Chinese  Ghost Story, Swordsman II, Dragon Inn) all featured Tsui Hark as part of  the crew.
Zu throws away any sense of believability at the very  beginning, and opts instead for a wonderfully majestic setting in which a  man can fly if he knows the proper spell and a sorceror can keep a giant  rock intent on world destruction at arm's length with the aid of his  goatee.
An acquired taste, for sure; anybody with a firm grip on reality  will hate this movie.  But a real gem for someone that is anxious for  something they've never seen before.",924998400,5,835,4.619047619047619
