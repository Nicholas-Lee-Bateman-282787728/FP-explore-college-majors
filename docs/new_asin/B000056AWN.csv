7931695,4,B000056AWN,"I watched the original series on TV and it seemed to interest me enough to follow it to the end.  Any review will depend upon the likes and dislikes of the viewer and I was content to sit back with my popcorn and loose myself in the presentation. I myself was interested enough to purchase the five VHS tapes a few years ago,but not through Amazon.  The tapes were put out by VCI Home Video.  And although I did enjoy viewing the limited series again, I was disappointed with the audio portion of the tapes. For one thing there was too much bass and very little treble.  It sounded as though the recordings were copied in someones garage during a yard sale.
 I needed to increase the volume to almost 100% in order to hear
 it.

Other than that, my rating stands at a four star.",1026864000,4,778,4.287671232876712
7931696,2,B000056AWN,"In the year 2790 A.D., a giant Ark, drifts through deep space, out of control, its crew having been killed five-hundred years earlier. When the accident that killed the crew occurred, the airlocks connecting the ship's domes that housed the last survivors of the dead planet, Earth, were sealed. Cut off from the outside world,: many communities simply forgot that they were on a spacecraft. They accepted that their world was fifty miles in diameter and the sky was metal. Content with their lot, no one knew that their world was in grave danger. Without a crew at the helm, the Ark was on a collision course with a sun.
Another short-lived SF series that probably looked exceedingly good on paper, but lost something in the translation to video. The only survivors of a ravage Earth roam the galaxy in their spaceship looking for a home. What they find, however, is alien menace and alleged adventure week after week. Harlan Ellison (along with Ben Bova) created the show, then aborted the mission upon seeing its maturation.
The Return
The crew of EARTHSHIP ARK's tiny exploratory vessel returns after spending 400 years in a time warp. But they're suffering from 'space senility' --a disease that rapidly speeds up aging if they remain on the ark.
