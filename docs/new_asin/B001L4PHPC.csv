I mean, they do a passable job but it's obvious the VAs were not clued into the depth of the characters beyond ""This is an anime about mystic vampires."" And if the biggest complaint I have is that it doesn't match the intricacy of the visual novels, then I don't have much to complain about.",1389657600,,363,4.2

The whole thing is something about a young boy with amnesia and seeing lines, a mysterious family and vampires.  All in night time.

8317263,4,B001L4PHPC,"Shiki Tohno suffered a life threatening injury when he was a child. Afterwards he was sent to live with his other relatives. After the death of his father he returns home to live with his sister in their family mansion. Even after all these years have passed since his accident, Shiki can still see strange red lines on everything around him. He has a pair of glasses that is able to make them invisible. On the day of his return he stabs and decapitates a woman named Acrueid in a fit of insanity. But she shows up beside him soon afterward as if nothing has happened. Acrueid is a vampire. She forces Shiki to act as her bodyguard until her strength is returned.

This anime is pretty good. It has an interesting story and some pretty cool characters. The animation, voice acting and music are all good as well. In my mind this series needed to be a bit longer. With such a grand plot I think it needed more time to develop the characters. The end of the series tries to be very emotional and touching, but it could have been so much better if I was more attached to the characters. I really enjoyed this series and I think it's worth $20, but It could have been a 5 star series with little more effort. All that being said I still liked this series quite a bit and I'm glad I bought it. If you can get it for $20 or less then I think you may as well give it a chance.",1351296000,2,1370,4.169811320754717

Okay, so I bought this series on a whim because of the wonderful reviews. I can usually trust Amazon.com reviews and I like short series that I don't have to commit to so I bought this show. I thought it would be as good as everyone else said. WRONG!

So the show starts off with Skiki Tohno who is a typical Japanese high school student that every anime has. However, he is ""cursed"" with the ability to see lines on people/objects that when they are cut will destroy the person or object. This ability is called something like Eyes of Mystic Depth Perception.

*Spoiler Maybe* He meets a woman named Arcuied, whom he promptly kills using this ability. He doesn't do it on purpose, though. It's like some part of him was just compelled to destroy her. Horrified, Shiki runs away from the scene of his crime hoping that it was just his imagination. But later he finds her alive and well asking him why he killed her. Turns out, she's a vampire searching for another vampire that's responsible for the recent murders in town. But what Shiki has done to Arcueid has made her considerably weak and until she heals Shiki has become sort of her body guard. Feeing a sense of responsibility, Shiki partners up with Arcueid in the search for the one responsible for the gruesome murders. *Maybe Spoiler end*

This plot sounds awesome, and the first episode was great at amping up the promise of great action scenes with the duo. The following episodes are also very promising. The supporting characters are not all what they seem and mysteries about Shiki's forgotten past and connection to the killer are all very titillating.

But that's it.

The show is all buildup with no resolution. We find out that there's something special about Shiki's family but it's never gone into depth what exactly is special about them. The twins in the show seem important somehow but they just take up space and it's really sad. None of the characters are ever really delved into much. Even Arcueid's background, which seemed very interesting, was only lightly touched upon. Why? There was so much potential there. I was especially disappointed by the character development, or lack thereof, for Ciel. She seemed very interesting and yet, by the end of the show we know almost nothing more about her than we did before: that she is not quite what she seems....oogedy-boogedy boo!

The bad-assness of the show quickly dies after the episodes take on a monster-of-the-week feel. The fight scenes are extremely short and unsatisfying to any viewer that thought there would be action.

The show also deviates and decides to showcase Shiki's relationship with Arcureid. I knew they were going to be romantically involved and all but it seemed rather random. Whole episodes are focused on their relationship, which is nice, I guess. But I feel that the main point of the story, finding the killer, is dropped by the wayside. Relationships aren't bad, but honestly, it feels like time is wasted dating when they should be finding the killer. I think this happens because the show is based on a visual novel. The show basically decides to focus on the romantic aspect that made the game popular to appeal to old fans. Even though I've never played a visual novel I still know how it usually ends and in this show it follows that formula to a T. I get how the creator's wanted to appeal to older fans but still...

I also have an issue with the opening, which I feel was very misleading. *cough* Much like the reviews for this series *cough* The theme song is really nice and I love it but the visuals and feeling/mood of the opening sequence lead the viewer to think that this show would be much deeper than it actually is. This show could have been very deep and I love the concept and the potential of the three characters I mentioned. It's just that the execution was poor.

The ending was out of no where and as the viewer I was supposed to be sad but I just didn't care enough about the characters to be sad. The characters were never developed enough for me to care about them as much as I would have liked to (I only remember three characters names after all). Everything felt so rushed that I wasn't even sure that the show was over. I was in disbelief. Is that it? Surely there's another DVD in here somewhere. But alas, there was no other DVD. The only thing that made me sad about the ending is that it ended too soon.

In the end, all of that buildup led to nothing. The entire series was just a tease at best and an orgasm denial at worst. Sure, we find out who the bad guy is and why he's connected to Shiki but all of the other plot threads are just left dangling. And in the end the viewer is left feeling empty and unfulfilled by the promise the was Lunar Legend Tsukihime.

You can watch the show if you want. I'm not saying don't watch it (not completely). I'm just saying don't buy it. Watch it online first. This show gave me some pretty good ideas for a story that I'm writing. The best thing you can learn from watching a show like this is what NOT to do and how NOT to waste great potential. You can always learn something, even from failure.

After watching the anime I decided to read the manga. Which is much better. The anime should have tried to escape the ""anime-ended-to-soon-now-go-read-the-manga"" trap that so many other shows have fallen into taking the viewers with them. The manga is a lot better in terms of pacing and explaining things. Characters are more three-dimensional; especially Ciel.

I haven't finished it all, though, because I can't find any more scanlations. However, the majority that I read is better than this show, which pales in comparison. Be warned, there are some ecchi moments in the manga but what else can you expect from something based on a visual novel, I guess? Shoot, Arcuied doesn't have those boobs for nothing. (They're bigger in the manga)

I gave this show 1 star to make things more even because honestly these wonderful reviews cost me $35 bucks. I ended up selling this thing on Craigslist for $10 because nobody wanted it for more than that. Otherwise I would give it a two star rating but I'm giving one star instead. In the words of Lestat from Interview with the Vampire: ""I'm going to give you the choice that I never had.""",1347062400,5,6293,4.561558901682905
8317265,5,B001L4PHPC,"This is ADVision's re-release of the original 3-disc release of Tsukihime by Geneon Entertainment. The packaging says Sentai Filmworks, which is a new business name of ADVision, after they had financial difficulties last year.

This is a 2-disc set but don't let that worry you. Although very rare for anime re-releases, here the DVD MPEG2 video quality has surprisingly been re-authored from scratch. It's a whole new encode and is noticeably better video quality than Geneon's version. The bitrate averages around 7 megabits/s which is the ADVision standard. Most of Geneon's titles averaged around 6 megabits/s, including Tsukihime. Furthermore, most of Geneon's titles suffer from after-image motion-blurring ""ghosting"" problems in the video encode, which are particularly severe on dark scenes and were very noticeable in all 3 original volumes of Tsukihime. Also, volumes 1 and 2 (not volume 3) of the original Tsukihime release suffered from improperly-encoded interlacing issues, which isn't common to Geneon releases in general.

None of those problems exist in ADVision's encode. ADVision video encodes have been consistent and among the best in the R1 anime industry since they started doing their encoding in-house (so my comments don't necessarily apply to their older DVD titles that were authored by M.O.F.C, etc).

Now, as to the video CONTENT, it's the exact same as the old Geneon release. Which is perfect. By this I mean that the English cast credits which are hardcoded into the video list the same Geneon voice actors, Japanese production crew, etc, and in the exact same font, as the old Geneon release. It is just the MPEG2 video quality that has been re-encoded.

The audio content is the exact same as the old Geneon release as well. Meaning that you get both the Japanese subtitled version and the exact same English dub using the Geneon/Bang Zoom voice actors. The subtitles are based on the Geneon subtitles as well but have been slightly edited in many places, mostly minor changes, sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse. Certain misspellings were carried over though (""yakasoku"" in the ending song lyrics) so that is how we can be sure.

The subtitle font has been changed to match ADVision's standard font, which some people might not prefer. I personally prefer their font to the Geneon font used in Tsukihime. However, the Geneon font matches up better with the Geneon cast credits which have been hardcoded into the OP/ED sequences.

The menus are changed completely, which should be of no surprise (the typical DVD collection re-release tends to change the menus and reduce the number of discs, but often keeps the exact same video encodes, which is usually possible because most R1 DVDs waste over a third of a DVD-9's disc space).

The price is pretty hefty for a collection re-release, but in my opinion it was well worth the money I spent even though I already owned the Geneon DVDs, due to the better video quality.",1240272000,26,2971,5.051020408163265
