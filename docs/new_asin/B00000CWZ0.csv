7905849,5,B00000CWZ0,"I love this workout. It is a great starter video, but you can increase the intensity by adding the steps or platforms or blocks or whatever they are called. The video keeps you interest. It's dramatic, not like most videos, which just show people standing in a room. The production is great. This is a must have!! RECOMMEND!!",1392940800,,325,4.620689655172414
7905850,5,B00000CWZ0,"This step workout is superb.  Easy to follow, great direction, choreography, music and team.  It definately works up a sweat if you are the sweating kind with low impact step workout and two short sections devoted to step push ups and abdominal work.  Gin is superb in her direction, takes regular heart count to ensure you are in your target range.  This video provides a fufilling workout experience.  I plan on using this one regularly and for a long time.",981158400,,459,4.6875
7905851,5,B00000CWZ0,"This has been my favorite workout for over five years.  I received it as a complementary gift when I bought my Reebok step and I can't find another workout that is as comprehensive that I can use it everyday.  I have had  three children and this video has been a staple of my post-partum workout.  Everyone is very professional and in shape, yet exhibit different body  styles and gender! Even my husband likes it.  The drumming music is  motivating and the cueing(sp?)is easy to follow without having to watch the video closely, a  must for people with small children. Overall, an excellent video!",953683200,8,598,4.737864077669903
7905852,5,B00000CWZ0,"This video was wonderful.  I used it for three years and then I broke it.  I am so upset and I have been trying to find it everywhere.  I hope it is re-released. I lost 30lbs and I am now in the process for my certification  as a personal fitness trainer. I tell everyone about this video. It is easy  to follow, but at the same time a great intense fat burning workout.  Sincerley, Amanda",952387200,,389,4.12
7905853,5,B00000CWZ0,I received this video as a complimentary gift when I bought a pair of Reebok shoes. I think it was about 8 years ago. I just recently broke the tape and am so disappointed. This is one of the best workout tapes I had. I  lost 48 lbs in a year and attribute the loss mostly to this tape. It's easy  to follow and keep up with. A great workout! I'm hoping this tape will go  back on the market.,950659200,6,392,3.875
