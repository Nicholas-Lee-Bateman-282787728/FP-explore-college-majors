3008318,4,B000XUOIQE,"My family loved this movie.  Disney, of course, did take care of these puppies during the filming.  I love the family experience that is so lacking in movies today, this one had it.  It also helps to reinforce the friendship that children have with dogs and that all dogs with the proper love and care are good dogs and can be trained well.  I wish there were more movies out there like this one.  Thank you so much Disney.",1202342400,8,423,4.30379746835443
3008319,1,B000XUOIQE,"The puppies used to make Snow Buddies were taken from their mother too early, illegally imported from the US to Canada, and caught parvo. Many puppies died or were removed from the set before replacement puppies were brought in. They also became sick.

Please do not support Disney for allowing animals to die in order to make their movie. Tell your children why you believe it is wrong to buy a product that caused innocent deaths!

Please do NOT BUY Snow Buddies.",1202256000,12,465,4.658536585365853
3008320,3,B000XUOIQE,"I am planning to rent the movie Snow Buddies to watch with my children.  I was concerned about the several one star reviews that sited animal cruelty in the production of the film.  I believe, based on reading the American Humane Society's press release, that the criticism is unfair and felt compelled to rebut those reviews.  Here is a direct quote from the Humane Society's release:
""American Humane is conducting a full investigation on the trainer and breeders and following the progress of the puppies that have been retired from the production, many of whom have been placed in new adoptive homes. The company producing Snow Buddies has complied with each request from American Humane and has made changes so that working puppies will not be put in any position where they may fall ill. The film production company has been very cooperative and has suspended filming until further notice. All of the dogs in the production now have been checked and are being cared for by a veterinarian. We will continue to monitor the production and release our findings once the investigation is complete.""
It may bother some folks that dogs were harmed for any reason and by any person in the making of a film.  However, by the Human Society's own account, the film production company appears to have done their best to look out for the welfare of the animals.  The problems seem to have been with the trainers and breeders.  It seems unfair to punish the producers of the film by condemning their product when they appear to have been unaware of the possible improper conduct of the trainers and breeders.",1202256000,38,1600,4.8
3008321,4,B000XUOIQE,My kids loved AIR BUDDIES--they watched it non-stop and are really excited for Snow Buddies.  I've already purchased this one for them as a surprise--I'm sure they'll wear it out too!,1202169600,19,183,4.903225806451613
3008322,5,B000XUOIQE,"I think people need to be aware that the American Humane Society WAS present during the filming of this movie and none of the animals were treated inhumanely. The same person who wrote one of the Amazon reviews also wrote the same review at several other sites and is spouting misinformation.

That being said, the movie is adorable, my child loved it. He's a fan of dogs and of dog sledding and he enjoyed every bit of it!",1202169600,44,423,4.423076923076923

3008324,1,B000XUOIQE,"I won't see this movie is against my love for good family movies. 30,8weeks golden retriever puppies,the Snow Buddies set in Vancouver, British Columbia  on Feb. 19, 2007 .  6 weeks old when they were separated from their mothers and brought by the trainer. American Humane has recommended that Snow Buddies only import puppies that are older than 14 weeks. All vaccinations have to be done by a veterinarian, along with thorough check-ups. American Humane was unaware that the puppies were underage when they were transported by the trainer from the breeders. American Humane report this.
The American Humane Association is the only national organization dedicated to protecting both children and animals",1201737600,21,705,5.285714285714286
3008325,1,B000XUOIQE,"Thank you ""Animal treatment on the set"" -  My family is an animal lover and this movie WILL NOT be in our collection of ""Family Films.""  I wish Disney and these powerful actors would use their power to teach people to have compassion for animals.  APPARENTLY the ""film production company"" DID NOT do their best to look out for the welfare of the animals.  Puppies did die. The trainers and breeders need to be more reponsible and caring.  And anyone else involved in the making of this film is responsible for the puppies.  People should not just to turn the other way when animals are not being cared for properly.  The puppies deaths are heartbreaking.",1201737600,22,654,4.6347826086956525
3008326,1,B000XUOIQE,"My attention was drawn to this film after reading of the poor treatment of the animals (dogs) on the set. The American Humane Society that monitor the treatment of animals on film sets found that several of the dogs had contracted the Parvo virus which lead to several animals having to be destroyed.

I think if the film is good or bad is besides the point. I could not show young children this film knowing that the cast were treated so poorly. The same company has released several other films on animals like Airbud and MVP. Shame on Disney for distributing this 'family' film.

All of the above is true and can be verified on the American Humane Association website quote from the press release is below.

American Humane Association Statement on Snow Buddies

Los Angeles (March 27, 2007)

The American Humane Association is conducting an investigation after five puppies died while on location for the filming of the movie Snow Buddies. As many as six others have fallen ill after exposure to parvovirus. Twenty-eight puppies are being treated after being exposed to the virus.",1201478400,39,1084,4.837837837837838
3008327,4,B000XUOIQE,"This direct-to-video movie is a sequel to last year's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Air-Buddies/dp/B000HWZ4QG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Air Buddies</a>. In this one, the five pups find themselves in Alaska, where they are soon befriended by Shasta, a Husky pup, and his owner, a young boy named Adam. The boy has big dreams of becoming a sled dog racer, and if the Buddies can get him to the finish line they will be on their way back home. They turn to a wise old Husky for mentorship, but on the day of the race, the Buds unexpectedly find themselves on their own. From what I've been able to see of the film I think many younger kids will love it (the puppies are cute), but adults will be bored.

Here are the bonus features:
* Audio commentary (from the dogs!).
* A blooper reel.
* A hip-hop-style music video of ""Lean on Me"" by ""Hannah Montana"" star Mitchel Musso.
* Behind the Scenes ""dog-u-mentary,"" which gives you a tour of the set from the perspective of the video's canine stars B-Dawg, Rosebud and Mudbud.
* A featurette on the film's visual effects.

3008384,2,B000XUOIQE,"This review is for parents with sensitive/easily scared children in response to recommendations of the ""Buddies"" movies as appropriate for this type of kid.  I thought I was escaping the main problem with Disney animated films - the cheap technique to get kids emotionally involved in the story - parental separation, usually via death, but I was misinformed.  Early in the movie, the puppies get ""trapped"" in a vehicle, thrown from a plane, & lost/separated from their parents.  Strike one - kid already has tears streaming down face.  (Though in fairness, they did try to make these scenes more humorous than sad or scary). Then, the Buddies meet another pup whose parents it's clear died in a tragic accident.  Bummer.  Later in the movie, another dog death & near death.  Really? There was also the requisite ""bad guy"" who was willing to physically injure people & let his own dogs die.  Of course, puppies are reunited with their parents at the end, but they also had to leave the poor little orphan dog behind to get back home after they spent the entire movie bonding with him (more separation/more tears in my house).

This one has six talking dogs so it scores well on that front but they find themselves in the snow which is not that unusual for dogs.

3008461,5,B000XUOIQE,"Of all the Buddies movies that I've seen, this one is my most favorite(Space Buddies & Spooky Buddies are a close 2nd & 3rd) With the exception of the villain, Jean-George, I love all the characters in the movie, especially the Buddies and Shasta.  Another thing I love about it is the messages that it delivers such as trying hard to be the best you can be and pay attention to wise advice. The plot is really neat, as well, where, because of Budderball's stomach, all the buddies end up in an ice cream shipment to a town in Alaska, where they met Shasta, an Alaskan husky, and his owner, Adam Bilson, who wants to be a dog-sled racer, just like his father was. So, the Buddies decide to help him fulfill his dream. Another thing I love is that the movie has some of the funniest lines, like when Rosebud introduces herself and her brothers to Shasta and he asks Mudbud ""Why do they call you Mudbud?"" & Mudbud looks at his reflection and says, ""I'm spotless! Think of a dirty place! Think of a dirty place!"" One last thing I love is the bonus features, especially the feature commentary with the Buddies and Shasta.  So, I recommend this movie to anyone who loves the Buddies movies, or dogs, in general, 'cause, believe me, this movie is WONDERFUL!!!",1362787200,2,1253,4.467248908296943

3008503,5,B000XUOIQE,This movie was given to me by my friend I watched it and I knew right off the bat that it wasn't going to be as good as the first one. shasta is played by Dylan Sprouse and Abigail Breslin Isn't the voice of Rosebud but It still is a funny movie Especially when you put the buddies commentary on. The movie starts out when all 5 of the puppies are with their new owners. and they meet together at the park. they decide to play hide and seek. Budderball's stomach gets the better of him again! he climbs into the ice cream truck. and the dogs find him and climb into the truck also and a few hours later they find themselves in Alaska! and then there's poor Adam with his Alaskan Husky. he wishes for christmas that he can form a dog sled team. then the buddies come along and Adam decides to form a dog sled team with them.in the end they go back to WA with their families and Adam has more confidence and shasta grows up to be a good dog sledder.

3008553,4,B000XUOIQE,SNOW BUDDIES is a fun film for kids and adults.

The joy in this film is watching the adorable puppies and the gorgeous Alaskan scenery. I wish the film had been in the theaters to enhance the beautiful visuals. I see a few reviews are commenting on possible animal cruelty but I feel strongly that Disney would take all precautions for the puppies' safety and well-being during the film.

3242817,3,B000XUOIQE,"I am planning to rent the movie Snow Buddies to watch with my children.  I was concerned about the several one star reviews that sited animal cruelty in the production of the film.  I believe, based on reading the American Humane Society's press release, that the criticism is unfair and felt compelled to rebut those reviews.  Here is a direct quote from the Humane Society's release:
""American Humane is conducting a full investigation on the trainer and breeders and following the progress of the puppies that have been retired from the production, many of whom have been placed in new adoptive homes. The company producing Snow Buddies has complied with each request from American Humane and has made changes so that working puppies will not be put in any position where they may fall ill. The film production company has been very cooperative and has suspended filming until further notice. All of the dogs in the production now have been checked and are being cared for by a veterinarian. We will continue to monitor the production and release our findings once the investigation is complete.""
It may bother some folks that dogs were harmed for any reason and by any person in the making of a film.  However, by the Human Society's own account, the film production company appears to have done their best to look out for the welfare of the animals.  The problems seem to have been with the trainers and breeders.  It seems unfair to punish the producers of the film by condemning their product when they appear to have been unaware of the possible improper conduct of the trainers and breeders.",1202256000,38,1600,4.8

American Humane has recommended that Snow Buddies only import puppies that are older than 14 weeks. All vaccinations have to be done by a veterinarian, along with thorough check-ups. American Humane was unaware that the puppies were underage when they were transported by the trainer from the breeders. American Humane report this.

The American Humane Society that monitor the treatment of animals on film sets found that several of the dogs had contracted the Parvo virus which lead to several animals having to be destroyed.

I think if the film is good or bad is besides the point. I could not show young children this film knowing that the cast were treated so poorly. The same company has released several other films on animals like Airbud and MVP. Shame on Disney for distributing this 'family' film.

American Humane Association Statement on Snow Buddies

Los Angeles (March 27, 2007)

The American Humane Association is conducting an investigation after five puppies died while on location for the filming of the movie Snow Buddies. As many as six others have fallen ill after exposure to parvovirus. Twenty-eight puppies are being treated after being exposed to the virus.",1201478400,39,1084,4.837837837837838

In this one, the five pups find themselves in Alaska, where they are soon befriended by Shasta, a Husky pup, and his owner, a young boy named Adam. The boy has big dreams of becoming a sled dog racer, and if the Buddies can get him to the finish line they will be on their way back home. They turn to a wise old Husky for mentorship, but on the day of the race, the Buds unexpectedly find themselves on their own. From what I've been able to see of the film I think many younger kids will love it (the puppies are cute), but adults will be bored.

Here are the bonus features:
* Audio commentary (from the dogs!).
* A blooper reel.
* A hip-hop-style music video of ""Lean on Me"" by ""Hannah Montana"" star Mitchel Musso.
* Behind the Scenes ""dog-u-mentary,"" which gives you a tour of the set from the perspective of the video's canine stars B-Dawg, Rosebud and Mudbud.

Overall, I enjoyed it, but I had seen Iron Will so I knew exactly what would happen. Everything from the ""accident"" to the kid running for his father, to the actions of the villain, the mannerisms of the villain, the fate of the villain, the dog-sled course, the finish; everything was copied from Iron Will. I also thought it was very corny how the pups ended up in Alaska to begin with. Why in the world would they paradrop a giant container of ice cream in the middle of Alaska?

The buddies come to the rescue and help when there is trouble on the trail during the race.

3242881,2,B000XUOIQE,"This review is for parents with sensitive/easily scared children in response to recommendations of the ""Buddies"" movies as appropriate for this type of kid.  I thought I was escaping the main problem with Disney animated films - the cheap technique to get kids emotionally involved in the story - parental separation, usually via death, but I was misinformed.  Early in the movie, the puppies get ""trapped"" in a vehicle, thrown from a plane, & lost/separated from their parents.  Strike one - kid already has tears streaming down face.  (Though in fairness, they did try to make these scenes more humorous than sad or scary). Then, the Buddies meet another pup whose parents it's clear died in a tragic accident.  Bummer.  Later in the movie, another dog death & near death.  Really? There was also the requisite ""bad guy"" who was willing to physically injure people & let his own dogs die.  Of course, puppies are reunited with their parents at the end, but they also had to leave the poor little orphan dog behind to get back home after they spent the entire movie bonding with him (more separation/more tears in my house).  And although I love me some cute puppies, I found this movie painfully boring as an adult.",1425340800,,1217,4.757142857142857

3242958,5,B000XUOIQE,"Of all the Buddies movies that I've seen, this one is my most favorite(Space Buddies & Spooky Buddies are a close 2nd & 3rd) With the exception of the villain, Jean-George, I love all the characters in the movie, especially the Buddies and Shasta.  Another thing I love about it is the messages that it delivers such as trying hard to be the best you can be and pay attention to wise advice. The plot is really neat, as well, where, because of Budderball's stomach, all the buddies end up in an ice cream shipment to a town in Alaska, where they met Shasta, an Alaskan husky, and his owner, Adam Bilson, who wants to be a dog-sled racer, just like his father was. So, the Buddies decide to help him fulfill his dream. Another thing I love is that the movie has some of the funniest lines, like when Rosebud introduces herself and her brothers to Shasta and he asks Mudbud ""Why do they call you Mudbud?"" & Mudbud looks at his reflection and says, ""I'm spotless! Think of a dirty place! Think of a dirty place!"" One last thing I love is the bonus features, especially the feature commentary with the Buddies and Shasta.  So, I recommend this movie to anyone who loves the Buddies movies, or dogs, in general, 'cause, believe me, this movie is WONDERFUL!!!",1362787200,2,1253,4.467248908296943

3243037,4,B000XUOIQE,"My children (2 and 5) LOVE this movie.  I agree with another reviewer:  if I could split my review adult/child, I would give it 3 for adults and 5 for kids.  It is difficult to find a movie both children like with just  the right amount of ""suspense"" and this one hits the mark perfectly.  The children stay interested in the story line without ever being concerned (no hands over eyes during the film!).  We are excited to now check out Air Buddies.  Glad to have another family movie to watch.",1204416000,,495,4.373626373626373

3243039,4,B000XUOIQE,My kids just love dogs and liked Air Buddies (which is the puppies' story) the best of the Disney Air Bud series. This story is nice and my kids have already watched it a bunch of times.,1204243200,,186,4.054054054054054

3243043,5,B000XUOIQE,"I agree with the other reviewers that stated that, while it is very sad that some of these puppies got sick from Parvo and died, the movie will only serve to create a generation that is more likely to love and respect animals.  Don't let these puppies' deaths have been for no good by shunning the movie.  My 5 year old daughter loves this movie and has learned a lot about dogs from it and now wants her own puppy to love.",1203724800,,423,4.146341463414634
3243044,1,B000XUOIQE,"People who care about animals should not rent or purchase Snow Buddies. At least 25 puppy ""actors"" were removed from the set during filming when many of them fell ill. According to veterinarians, the puppies suffered serious health problems, including ""heavy intestinal parasite loads."" Three of them had to be euthanized after suffering from the highly contagious parvovirus.

These weeks-old puppies were taken from their nursing mothers to be used like disposable props. The producers of this movie exploited these babies specifically to target the lucrative children's movie audience. Kids love puppies, but animals should not suffer and die so that studios can sell DVDs.",1203552000,15,676,5.438095238095238
3243045,5,B000XUOIQE,A great movie for the young ones. If you love puppies you will probably enjoy this also. Anyone who enjoyed the AirBud movies will like this.,1203552000,,141,4.461538461538462

When Air buddies five talking puppies are accidentaly transported by plan and dropped of in Alaska they embarking on another classic adventure.

This movie has phonimal moral leasons about, courage, love, loyalty, frienship, and perserverance in the face off extremly difficult and slim odds.  The cast features the voice of Jim Belsui recetnly seen back in Underdog dog from mid 2007 and one of the two young boy actors from the Suite Life of Sack and Cody as Chasta. I'm not sure which one it is. If you loved Air budies and it's prequels made before the dogs talked you will fall in love with this tear jerking, heart throbing hit from Disney. Can the Buddies with the help of young casta and the great Talim win the race and be reunite with there parents and kids that love then. Wil Chasta young owners dream finally true.

3243048,5,B000XUOIQE,Great movie. One of the best I have watched for kids.  There is another  movie  called Air Buddies. I have already that one!!!  All I can say is get both of them!!,1202601600,,163,4.0
3243049,5,B000XUOIQE,This was fantastic! Both my son and I watched it and loved it. It was so nice to watch a movie where it didn't have to be sad and upsetting first. Just a wonderful film! Great job Disney!,1202515200,,187,3.9473684210526314
3243050,4,B000XUOIQE,SNOW BUDDIES is a fun film for kids and adults. The story is simple and predictable--a group of 5 Golden Retriever puppies accidentally end up in Alaska and become part of a dog race. The joy in this film is watching the adorable puppies and the gorgeous Alaskan scenery. I wish the film had been in the theaters to enhance the beautiful visuals. I see a few reviews are commenting on possible animal cruelty but I feel strongly that Disney would take all precautions for the puppies' safety and well-being during the film. I love animals and this delightful film brought a smile to my face.,1202428800,2,591,4.584905660377358
3243051,5,B000XUOIQE,"I read the reviews for this and my thoughts are let kids enjoy it. If things are going on in regards to the pups care let the right people deal with that. We as kids go to ""belive"" in things, the world is so harsh these days, if your child truly loves ""dog-dog"" then let them watch the movie, it is a good movie.",1202428800,2,312,3.890625
3243052,5,B000XUOIQE,"The treatment of the pups lies with the breeders and trainers not the producers. All the pups should have had their shots before they got to the US and started working on the movie. Blame the trainers and the breeders, not Disney. I have all the Air Bud movies and the previous one with the pups, we'll buy this one too. I feel like Disney would not intentionally harm animals in any movie due to public rebellion. They know people would boycott the product. Buy the movie and enjoy it! Fault the breeders and the trainers! We have all seen the horror stories and they're serving time for it right now!",1202342400,4,602,4.4324324324324325
