8655738,5,B00K3VYOY4,"The film school at Loyola Marymount University, a Jesuit university, produced this series of four classic shorts based on the New Testament. For a religious production clearly intended for Catholic catechism classes in the the 1940s, we've got some pretty high production values here, with a veteran director and professional actors. The four videos on this disc average about 25 minutes apiece, some longer and some shorter.

The scripts are pretty creative interpretations of Gospel stories. In particular, the film on the boyhood of Jesus (hardly mentioned in the Bible outside of Luke's Gospel) and the parable of the Good Samaritan take some intriguing creative license in developing the characters and themes beyond what is explicitly mentioned in Scripture. I found the videos with the adult Jesus a bit more dull, weighed down by a certain pious stuffiness, but still worthwhile. Family life and other trappings of the stories feel updated to ""contemporary"" 1940s values, with modern-day characters like a rabbi telling the stories in flashback as a framing device in some of the films.

Other than a certain predictability in the storytelling, these videos are fascinating for any student of film or religious cinema, and probably made excellent Sunday school viewing back in their day. Today they might be a little slow and stuffy for kids, but they are still fun to watch. No special features on the disc, and the audio-video quality could have used a bit more sharpness in places, but the disc is generally a classy affair.
