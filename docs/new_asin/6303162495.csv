587647,5,6303162495,"By 1979, Elton John was in a creative slump. He broke up with his longtime lyricist, Bernie Taupin. His hit streek was dwindling vastly, and his 1978 album A Single Man flopped. But in 1979, Elton's career started on an upward swing. He started a
solo tour with just him and percussionist Ray Cooper. They embarked on a world tour that took them to places they never performed in before. Someone said that they should try performing in Russia, which at first they thought was impossible. But they were wrong. Elton became the first pop star to perform behind the Iron Curtain. Elton and Ray's stripped-down
performances of songs like Bennie and the Jets (great version of
the song), Part Time Love, Funeral for a Friend, Tonight, and I Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself come alive with flare. Elton does a few performances without Ray. His solo performances of his megahits Rocket Man, Candle in the Wind, Your Song and Daniel are good, but cannot be compared to his haunting version of Sixty Years On, with haunting photos of Russia's poor people. But the highlight is the closing Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting/Pinball Wizard medley. Elton and Ray use just piano and drums here, and they give off a hard-rocking medley of the classic Elton tracks. This tape is an excellent video.",1038528000,,1283,4.783783783783784

7840036,1,6303162495,Don't buy it. Not the whole concert. They left off the best part with Ray Cooper at the end. Should tell people that because most would not have bought it,1506556800,,154,4.166666666666667

This was Elton in his prime, and he doesn't disappoint.  His voice knows no limits, and his piano playing is amazing.  Plus, percussionist Ray Cooper is a madman.

I'm very pleased with this DVD.",1487116800,,285,4.64
7840038,5,6303162495,"From what I can see, all of the other reviews are for other DVD releases prior to this Shout Factory in 2016.  The video and audio on this release are exactly what I expected, very good for both.  It is 1.33 to 1 full frame and 2.0 stereo sound.  The video looks much better than youtube posts.  There is good clarity and you can easily see individual hairs on Elton's head during close ups.  The sound gives you the feeling of being in the concert hall for the show with a slight echo of the venue.  The concert showcases Elton's talented singing and playing since Ray Cooper only accompanies about half the songs.  It also features a nice documentary in between songs that doesn't cut off any performances.  There is even a short excerpt of Elton jumping up on stage with a band at a hotel for I heard it through the Grapevine.",1484179200,,829,4.372549019607843
7840039,3,6303162495,"I remember having seen this video back in the early 1980s. I had a chance to see it again a fe days ago. My original impression, 30+ years later still stands: Love the music, but Elton without his band feels kind of empty. I still feel he should have brought the other 4 guys with him instead of that old guy that plays the congas and thinks he's the star of the show. Even ""Animal"" of the Muppets would have been more entertaining as a backup musician.
And the reason why I give this video 3 stars is because although the songs and the performer deserve 5/5, the stripped down performance, and the bags'o'squm Soviets - the top Nomeklantura - that got the best seats, while leaving the cheap seats to the average Soviet citizen, destroyed with their moronic gestures , fingers on ears, the KGB severely beating up people who started to dance on the aisles instead of sitting like the failed old people in the front rows, brings me back to the good old days when I had this extreme hatred for all things communist or Soviet... call it the product of Middle and High school education in the Reagan years.  When in 1990 the USSR ceased to exist, the West's biggest mistake was to not pursue and assassinate every KGB agent they could find... Let a rat live and it will become millions. Now we have Putin,,, but that's a discussion for another album.",1473465600,,1347,4.4534412955465585

7840041,1,6303162495,terrible recording. Too bad there are no returns on digital content. I only watched a few minutes before I had to turn it off. Just awful.,1427155200,2,138,4.346153846153846

7840043,4,6303162495,"I recall seeing this back around 1980.  It was fascinating then.
But I had spent years studying the Soviet Union.
The video includes some shots of Russian cities and some commentary about
life in a late Stalinist society'; this may not appeal to some viewers.",1368921600,,259,4.7555555555555555
7840044,5,6303162495,"This is more than a  concert film since, like Paul McCartney & Wings' ""Rock Show"", it features interviews and behind-the-scenes stuff mixed in.  I recall seeing this film on TV when I was a young kid, and I was mesmerised even then by Elton's ability to perform a whole concert virtually alone.  This is not to discount the manic antics of one Ray Cooper, percussionist extraordinaire on the British pop scene even today -- and a key member of the Elton John Band of the 70s.

In 1979 Elton toured many parts of the world -- Northern Ireland, Israel, and the USSR among others -- that weren't on the usual flight path of rock & pop stars.  And he did it with only Ray Cooper to accompany him, musically speaking. In this film we see them perform stripped-down interpretations of many hits and strong cuts.  They work hard to connect with the Soviet audiences, who are both restrained and constrained in their responses.  We also have a time capsule of the first pop/rock performer allowed into the USSR, and many fascinating shots of the people and architecture there.

Buy this concert video of Elton John without the crazy costumes, without the gaudy glasses, without the crack backing band he used throughout most of the 70s.  This is truly a singer-songwriter: a man and his music.",1333843200,,1285,4.6755555555555555
