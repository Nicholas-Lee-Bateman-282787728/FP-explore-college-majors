7801301,5,1929732279,"Movies like this one do not come along very often, just excellent. It's proof that we've come very far in our understanding about HIV and Aids.  What made this story so thought provoking is the unique way it was presented from the doctor's point of view. I can't say I ever thought about how devastating it must have been to treat these people who were inevitably going to die, and soon for most. Young or old, gay or straight, the doctor was not prepared, and while his personal life suffered, especially his marriage, due to the enormous demands of his patients, he could not walk away.  I am in awe of the doctor/author, Abraham Verghese, both for not turning away from these patients, but also for telling his story for the rest of us to know and understand. It's a shame that the one and only one-star reviewer had to demonstrate his ignorance here, but on second thought, he only validated the intelligence of this story. One as insensitive as he would not be the typical audience for this movie, and who probably bought into the the religious viewpoint that Aids is ""God's vengeance"" for the gay lifestyle. The story was painful at times, like the scene with Hal Holbrook, who got straight into the good doctor's heart with the desperately sad ending of what was probably his very good life, all due to..well watch the movie.

7801302,5,1929732279,"For a movie made ten years ago, the director did an amazing job depicting the ""world"" Dr. Verghese was living in Tennessee. The movie, based on his book, depicts the Doctor's interaction with several HIV patients who returned home to family and friends for their final days. And how Dr. Veghese struggled both personally and professionally with the disease. Well cast, well acted and an engrossing story.  Dr. Verghese is a remarkable man and it was interesting to watch this movie and learn more about him and the things that shaped his incredible writing-both biographical and the magical stories (Cutting For Stone).",1274659200,,619,5.068627450980392
7801303,5,1929732279,"It's a sad but yet beautiful story of love for humanity. Dr. Abraham Verghese came to America to practice medicine. His specialty is infectious disease. He came here in the '80s so of course he has to deal with AIDS. At that time you would not think it would be in Tennessee. He treated his patients with not just respect but with love. He truly cared about his patients. To the point his marriage was in jeopardy.

He was from India and Johnson City, Tennessee was where he ended up. He wasn't treated like a outsider, the town folks treated him with dignity, as one of their own. Dr. Verghese felt like it was his own country.

So many people think Southerners are a cruel backward people like in Deliverance. They're not. They may be behind the times but if you treat them respectfully, they will bend over backward for you.",1153958400,5,827,4.470198675496689
