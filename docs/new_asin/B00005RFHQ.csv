It's done in sort of a documentary style with mostly experts talking, but it's hard to understand the connection and flow between them. It's not going to win any awards, but, hey, I'm trying to feel better. So if it's your goal for you or someone you love to feel better, this is a good video for that.",1383955200,,469,4.340909090909091
