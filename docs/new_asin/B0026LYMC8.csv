It's painful to get through terrible movie. If you're a mermaid collector you can do without this one. If you like wrestling go for it! I'll sell you my copy cheap!",1465171200,,330,4.516666666666667

8353025,3,B0026LYMC8,"With all the countless great cult, horror, demented and hyper-violent flicks coming out of Asia over the last decade, you see a title like 'Oh! My Zombie Mermaid' and think to yourself, ""sign me up"", right?  Oh! My Zombie Mermaid-loving friends, how wrong we can be...

There's no horror, no camp, no dementia, no zombies, there's not really a mermaid either, what we've been suckered into here is a wrestling movie!!! WTF! I kid you not!

Here's the down-lo on this woefully misrepresented time-killer : Shishio (real life New Japan Pro-Wrestler) is having a house-warming party at his new digs when violence erupts thanks to a rival who crashes the fest and the mansion ends up in shambles. His wife Asami is injured in the melee and seeks medical treatment that is slowly turning her into a zombie mermaid (hint: you need to be dead to qualify as a zombie last time I looked, though the literature on such things is rather vague). Shishio needs to rebuild his palace and save his wife, so his manager suggests staging a death match between Shishio and all of his rivals on pay-per-view TV.  Logical, right?

The rest of the flick is the wrestling match, where we find out his manager has double-crossed him on several levels and was behind infecting his wife - my apologies for the spoilers, but I'm riding with the assumption you weren't going to put yourself through this like I did...

Was it terrible? No. If you knew what you were sitting down to before you developed expectations based on the title, cover and details, you might actually enjoy this one; it's a decent family flick, believe it or not. But my universe is a drastically different one from most of you, so I was pissed...it's like a combination of 'Splash' and the WWF.

Oh, yeah, someone can tell the previous reviewer that he can come out from under the bed now, his fear of mermaids is unwarranted in this case...",1284249600,7,1888,4.651651651651652
