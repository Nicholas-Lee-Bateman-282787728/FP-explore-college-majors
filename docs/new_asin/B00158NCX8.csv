3141077,5,B00158NCX8,I was really amazed how well my seniors did with these yoga exercises.  It made me realize that they could do a lot more than I thought.  I have bumped up my program for them.,1295568000,5,175,3.9714285714285715

I can tell the difference in how I feel if I don't do it, am using the program almost every day now. Thank you, everyone connected with this program!!!!!

3141080,3,B00158NCX8,"I was excited to try this video with our residents because it had such great reviews, it was done in a chair, and many residents had requested some form of yoga.  I work in a building that has assisted living and independent living residents and about 10 residents participated in the first session, with their average age being 77-80; I would guess it was 50% assisted living residents and 50% independent residents.  A few residents left early, a few stopped before it was finished but continued to watch it, and a few residents really enjoyed it.  A handful of residents later commented that they didn't like this video because they felt their bodies ""didn't twist like that anymore.""  They also commented that they were sore following the workout.  A few residents were also very excited about it and really enjoyed the video.

From my perspective, I thought the video was nearly perfect.  The instructors explain the exercise clearly and move slowly. I wouldn't have thought the twisting was too extensive for them, had they not shared their feelings with me. I thought it seemed very easy to follow.  Had I watched/done this video on my own, I would give it 5 stars, however, I only rated it 3 stars due to the resident comments listed above.",1268611200,244,1248,4.74537037037037

3141083,2,B00158NCX8,"Our seniors group still need to position ourselves right so we can see the video.  The moves make you look away a lot.......

Anne Pringle is wonderful in this DVD.  She is slow and deliberate and explains her moves in very simple terms.  My seniors are in their 80s and they found this helpful.

HOWEVER, her male partner whizzes through the movements and uses Yoga jargon that my seniors don't understand.  They get lost when he is on and also frustrated.

In the end, they didn't like the DVD and always want to go back to Anne's Stretch and Strength Chair excercise DVD.

This DVD might be more appropriate for a younger crowd.",1253750400,73,631,4.522123893805309

These chair exercises are performed in a perfect pace, with music that is great- you do not grow tired of it after playing several times.  They provide so much variety, I never get bored.  I feel better, look better, think better and feel much happier.

The male talks and moves fast but I have stopped, moderated or skipped the movements until I could manage them.  I  exercise with it at least 3x per week and alternate with stretch and strength exercises. (I don't like Anne's stretch and strength exercises as much.)

3141161,4,B00158NCX8,"I have quite a few of Anne Burnell's DVDs, and I like her style very much.  I decided to try chair yoga with her, because I trust how she presents things (and I did not have good yoga experiences in classes in the past).  I've only done the intro yoga program, not the advanced.  It's a great stretch for anybody. Please note that there is one standing part.
My only quibble is that the young man who leads some of the yoga exercises speaks very fast and rushes through the poses--kind of hard to follow if you're turned away from the screen and can't get a look at what's happening!  Then Anne comes back on and takes the viewer slowly through similar poses.

3141163,3,B00158NCX8,"I really wanted a chair yoga video and they are hard to find! I was very pleased to find this one and purchased it based on the review by a yoga instructor for the elderly, however I only watched this video once. I have had it for five months and have not gone back to it. I think that the female leader was acceptable. I could somewhat follow and keep up with her pace. I did not like the male leader. He used a faster pace and his directions were not clear to me. He took the time to name the pose then raced me through it. I therefore experienced some frustration during a period when I was attempting to stretch, breathe and be calm. There was minimal coaching, so you have to adjust your position based on what you see in the video. It is very hard to make adjustments by sight when the leader is taking you immediately to the next position or the next breath. Overall, this could have been a really good program if the leaders had simply slowed down and provided moments and methods that you can use to check that you are breathing or stretching correctly. Although I really wanted a video, I am now back to using Kabat-Zinn's yoga and mindfulness audio tapes.",1463616000,,1166,4.304545454545455

3141187,4,B00158NCX8,"As an activity director with a background in Occupational Therapy, I can really appreciate this DVD for seniors.  This was purchased to break the monotony of daily aerobics and it works.  So far the residents in our facility feel that it is definitely tough, however they are working through it.  Anne Pringle Burnell does a great job with step by step descriptions of what needs to be done during the poses and her voice is soothing.  The other instructor we can do without.  The technical yoga jargon for this population is so unnecessary.  I don't know many seniors with arthritis in their joints that can do the pose he was doing with his arms, HECK I can't even do it.  Anyway, thanks for putting this together for what is a great cause (our seniors).

3141190,5,B00158NCX8,"This is a review for her Annie Pringle's Strength chair exercise video.  I bought it about a year ago.  Several friends and I took a chair exercise class at our local senior center but they kept firing the instructor.  Four of us wearied of this and began meeting at my house every Monday and Thursday morning at 9:00 and we still do Annie's video!.  We use my downstairs family room for a studio,  We usually do Annie Pringle's chair strength program but sometimes we add her longer Strength one.  We call our selves the Pringles and LOVE Annie.  We have named the various ladies in the class (on the video) and greet them when we meet.  I just had a medical issue and was in the hospital for three weeks.  The last week involved physical therapy and I was able to do very well due to my bi-weekly videos.  Give Annie a hug for us.  Carolyn, Judy, Barbara and Peggy",1450051200,3,866,4.35

Regardless that Anne shows the moves just prior to his major portion, he DOES move way too quickly to be able to facilitate the moves with ease and gentleness - which I thought was one of the points of doing yoga.  I just pause it, do his section on my own and then fast forward to where Anne picks it up again.  Other sections of his guidance are fine though. I have already recommended it to others.

3141415,1,B00158NCX8,"Six days a week me and Anne meet up for our exercise routine and have for a couple of years now! I have literally burned through her other DVDs and had to order new ones. They are perfect for the senior who does not have one foot in the grave, fairly healthy and trying to stay that way. This new Chair Yoga Program was a huge disappointment because the nice, clever, amusing Anne Pringle Burrell is missing in action. The activity is way too slow except for the non-senior ""actor"" guy who is on the program way too much and who contorts way too fast while talking with marbles in his mouth.

I guess I expected this to be more like the fabulous Stretch Program, possibly slowed a little with more posing, but not like we were actual Hinduese with a whole dang day to find nirvana.  Anne ringing the little yoga bell at various points was preposterous from someone who gets you to laugh out loud in a workout by calling an exercise the ""Duh"" or getting you to fly like a bird or fly or land an airplane.

My wish list is that Anne would make more dvds----using stretch bands (her first is out of production), more weight training programs, or dvds but for out of the chair senior exercises. There is such a hole in the market and I'm sure her groupies are in the thousands. As for this Chair Yoga Program, unfortunately in my opinion, it will be traded in like mine, on a lot of garage sale tables.....and as for the ""actor""....I don't think we will be seeing on prime time anytime soon.

See you tomorrow Anne...for Balance and Posture!",1404777600,3,1537,4.382456140350877

They are designed to extend the capabilities of muscles and joints so one may reach things not before possible and stretch joints that have atrophied from non-use. The exercises encourage one to increase the amount of oxygenation in the bloodstream and that leads to an increased feeling of well being. It also aids sleep at night. Since it is on a DVD, you can just skip the parts that exceed your physical limitations and concentrate on the ones that increase your daily functionality.

So I went through the physical theraphy which helped my shoulder and back to heal. Yet the doctor told me the pain would be chronic for the rest of my life. And I was not going to let this pain stay with me. So I tried many things, and then discovered this Chair Yoga Program. It is meant for really any age from young to old who have limited range of movement. This program is very gentle for me and is easy to follow. After using this for about a month at 6 days of the week, found that my range of motion has improved.
If you purchase this, start by just doing this for one half of the time for the first 4 - 6 days, then gradually get into doing the whole program. This way it will be easier to use and follow and you will work your way up to the whole program.
What I have found is that this is similar to a type of Yoga Theraphy Class that I take a gym. It is a great therapy for me to use for my shoulder and back and now, I am almost pain free and have my full motion back in my shoulder, right arm and back areas.
One more thing: I have had this program for over one year. Just got around to doing a review for it. Noticed that this is kind of hard to find. But it can be found online in some online stores.",1380499200,4,1330,3.8576642335766422

Some segments flow faster than others.  But with time, practice and use it is becoming second nature to do the routines.  They help so much with muscle spasms in my neck and back.

Also, there is a male instructor in this program and he and Anne switch leadership between exercises (poses) which is very distracting.  The male instructor also attempts to lead the meditation portion of this DVD which I did not care for.  If you are looking for an exercise DVD for stretching or increasing range of motion, I recommend Anne's Core Fitness DVD or Tammi Lee's stretching DVD.  Tammi Lee's DVD has many of the same chair poses as this yoga DVD but is faster paced and better presented.

3141670,3,B00158NCX8,"This was the most expensive workout I purchased and was the one I was most interested in.  I was also the most disappointed in this purchase.  I attend the Silver Sneakers Yoga Stretch at the YMCA  twice a week and I really felt that I should be following through at home doing the chair yoga more often.  I really wish each Yoga move was held longer.  I felt like I was rushed through each move especially when Jim did his section.  Anne's moves were given more time.  Jim's sections were rushed.  I also was very disappointed that most of the program was done in the chair.  Once the section started on standing, it was very very short.  I did not time it but there was only 3 or 4 moves.  Standing is so important for the legs and opening the back.  My yoga instructor at the YMCA spends 25 minutes in chair and 25 standing then 5 minutes relaxing/meditation beginning and ending (with water breaks).

I wish that they made the video longer instead of making the moves so rushed.  Yoga is suppose to relax you not rush you.  My class in the YMCA is 1 hour this workout was only 52 minutes (two separate beginner and full workout not sure how long each is).  Why so short???  With proper directions and completing the move time needs to be included!!  She did not even give any breaks for water.  There should be time added for this because it is very important.

I even watched some youtube video of Ann Pringle and these were brief also so I guess I should of known.  I just figured this was a youtube so she could not do as much in this media.

Maybe after I do the video more often I will be happier.  Next time, I will try to complete the beginner and the full program to see if this is more satisfying.  I am sure after repeating the video I will also know the moves better and hopefully they will not feel so rushed:))))",1330128000,6,1829,4.26530612244898

3141706,5,B00158NCX8,"Update 1-23-13 - I still use this program almost daily 19 months later and plan to the rest of my life.  The length of the program, the moves included and the measured deep breathing throughout are exactly what I need to keep going.  I've tried about every other senior yoga program there is and don't like any of them except for John Schorletzer (sp?) Ageless Yoga which I sometimes alternate with - his really isn't yoga but a gentle exercise program that increases mobility which I also need.  Anne's is true healing Iyengar yoga and I don't think you can find anything better. :o)

My review from 8-2-11 not long after I started it:  I highly recommend this program by Anne Burnell for anyone with fibromyalgia.  It is not advertised for FMS, but it should be - it has worked an absolute miracle on me.  I've tried a couple of other DVDs and both made the pain much worse.  19 years of ""fibro-fog"" disappeared during the very first session 7 weeks ago, and hasn't returned.  Headaches and chest pains (anyone with FMS will know what I'm talking about) were gone after two sessions, crippling back pain was nearly gone by two weeks.  I could also bend over to pick up something out of the floor with no pain for the first time in 8 years.  Amazing improvements in flexibility and energy level allow me to spend some time on enjoyable craft projects now instead of spending all my time on the sofa taking non-restorative naps.  It doesn't cure FMS, but it keeps the symptoms at bay temporarily if I faithfully do it first thing in the morning.  Certain activities can cause flareups of back pain and fatigue as before, but not as severe, and the next session will usually settle it back down.

This is true healing yoga on a simplified scale. I don't understand how something that looks so easy can have any affect on your well-being, but it definitely does. Soothing music and a beginning relaxation session get your body and mind ready for the exercises.  Easy gentle moves all while seated in a chair with emphasis on deep breathing gets oxygen to all the muscles that are being stretched and creates the miracle :o)  And the time flies by - total of 40 minutes including the ending relaxation, but it seems more like only 5 minutes have passed so don't be afraid it will take too long and that you will get bored.  It's the best 40 minutes I could ever spend. I haven't gone past the basic session yet but hope to soon start making use of Anne's other DVD set for seniors, called Stretch & Strength, on alternate days.  I had so much improvement in the first couple of weeks I have since bought 8 DVDs as gifts for family and friends that I thought might get some benefit from it.  Before receiving this DVD,  I thought the rest of my life would be spent on the sofa. Thank you Anne for saving my life!  Namaste!",1312243200,125,2818,4.475538160469667

A handful of residents later commented that they didn't like this video because they felt their bodies ""didn't twist like that anymore.""  They also commented that they were sore following the workout.  A few residents were also very excited about it and really enjoyed the video.

From my perspective, I thought the video was nearly perfect.  The instructors explain the exercise clearly and move slowly.

I've only done the intro yoga program, not the advanced.  It's a great stretch for anybody. Please note that there is one standing part.
My only quibble is that the young man who leads some of the yoga exercises speaks very fast and rushes through the poses--kind of hard to follow if you're turned away from the screen and can't get a look at what's happening!  Then Anne comes back on and takes the viewer slowly through similar poses.

3375660,3,B00158NCX8,"I really wanted a chair yoga video and they are hard to find! I was very pleased to find this one and purchased it based on the review by a yoga instructor for the elderly, however I only watched this video once. I have had it for five months and have not gone back to it. I think that the female leader was acceptable. I could somewhat follow and keep up with her pace. I did not like the male leader. He used a faster pace and his directions were not clear to me. He took the time to name the pose then raced me through it. I therefore experienced some frustration during a period when I was attempting to stretch, breathe and be calm. There was minimal coaching, so you have to adjust your position based on what you see in the video. It is very hard to make adjustments by sight when the leader is taking you immediately to the next position or the next breath. Overall, this could have been a really good program if the leaders had simply slowed down and provided moments and methods that you can use to check that you are breathing or stretching correctly. Although I really wanted a video, I am now back to using Kabat-Zinn's yoga and mindfulness audio tapes.",1463616000,,1166,4.304545454545455

Anne Pringle Burnell does a great job with step by step descriptions of what needs to be done during the poses and her voice is soothing.  The other instructor we can do without.  The technical yoga jargon for this population is so unnecessary.  I don't know many seniors with arthritis in their joints that can do the pose he was doing with his arms, HECK I can't even do it.

We use my downstairs family room for a studio,  We usually do Annie Pringle's chair strength program but sometimes we add her longer Strength one.  We call our selves the Pringles and LOVE Annie.  We have named the various ladies in the class (on the video) and greet them when we meet.  I just had a medical issue and was in the hospital for three weeks.  The last week involved physical therapy and I was able to do very well due to my bi-weekly videos.  Give Annie a hug for us.  Carolyn, Judy, Barbara and Peggy",1450051200,3,866,4.35

3375912,1,B00158NCX8,"Six days a week me and Anne meet up for our exercise routine and have for a couple of years now! I have literally burned through her other DVDs and had to order new ones. They are perfect for the senior who does not have one foot in the grave, fairly healthy and trying to stay that way. This new Chair Yoga Program was a huge disappointment because the nice, clever, amusing Anne Pringle Burrell is missing in action. The activity is way too slow except for the non-senior ""actor"" guy who is on the program way too much and who contorts way too fast while talking with marbles in his mouth.

I guess I expected this to be more like the fabulous Stretch Program, possibly slowed a little with more posing, but not like we were actual Hinduese with a whole dang day to find nirvana.  Anne ringing the little yoga bell at various points was preposterous from someone who gets you to laugh out loud in a workout by calling an exercise the ""Duh"" or getting you to fly like a bird or fly or land an airplane.

My wish list is that Anne would make more dvds----using stretch bands (her first is out of production), more weight training programs, or dvds but for out of the chair senior exercises. There is such a hole in the market and I'm sure her groupies are in the thousands. As for this Chair Yoga Program, unfortunately in my opinion, it will be traded in like mine, on a lot of garage sale tables.....and as for the ""actor""....I don't think we will be seeing on prime time anytime soon.

They are designed to extend the capabilities of muscles and joints so one may reach things not before possible and stretch joints that have atrophied from non-use. The exercises encourage one to increase the amount of oxygenation in the bloodstream and that leads to an increased feeling of well being. It also aids sleep at night. Since it is on a DVD, you can just skip the parts that exceed your physical limitations and concentrate on the ones that increase your daily functionality.

3376002,5,B00158NCX8,"Several years ago, I was in a serious car accident and my right shoulder and parts of my back were badly injured. So I went through the physical theraphy which helped my shoulder and back to heal. Yet the doctor told me the pain would be chronic for the rest of my life. And I was not going to let this pain stay with me. So I tried many things, and then discovered this Chair Yoga Program. It is meant for really any age from young to old who have limited range of movement. This program is very gentle for me and is easy to follow. After using this for about a month at 6 days of the week, found that my range of motion has improved.
If you purchase this, start by just doing this for one half of the time for the first 4 - 6 days, then gradually get into doing the whole program. This way it will be easier to use and follow and you will work your way up to the whole program.
What I have found is that this is similar to a type of Yoga Theraphy Class that I take a gym. It is a great therapy for me to use for my shoulder and back and now, I am almost pain free and have my full motion back in my shoulder, right arm and back areas.
One more thing: I have had this program for over one year. Just got around to doing a review for it. Noticed that this is kind of hard to find. But it can be found online in some online stores.",1380499200,4,1330,3.8576642335766422

Some segments flow faster than others.  But with time, practice and use it is becoming second nature to do the routines.  They help so much with muscle spasms in my neck and back.  I look forward to a time when I will ""graduate"" to the next level, but I see myself using this CD even then for specific help of the neck and upper back.

Also, there is a male instructor in this program and he and Anne switch leadership between exercises (poses) which is very distracting.  The male instructor also attempts to lead the meditation portion of this DVD which I did not care for.  If you are looking for an exercise DVD for stretching or increasing range of motion, I recommend Anne's Core Fitness DVD or Tammi Lee's stretching DVD.  Tammi Lee's DVD has many of the same chair poses as this yoga DVD but is faster paced and better presented.

3376167,3,B00158NCX8,"This was the most expensive workout I purchased and was the one I was most interested in.  I was also the most disappointed in this purchase.  I attend the Silver Sneakers Yoga Stretch at the YMCA  twice a week and I really felt that I should be following through at home doing the chair yoga more often.  I really wish each Yoga move was held longer.  I felt like I was rushed through each move especially when Jim did his section.  Anne's moves were given more time.  Jim's sections were rushed.  I also was very disappointed that most of the program was done in the chair.  Once the section started on standing, it was very very short.  I did not time it but there was only 3 or 4 moves.  Standing is so important for the legs and opening the back.  My yoga instructor at the YMCA spends 25 minutes in chair and 25 standing then 5 minutes relaxing/meditation beginning and ending (with water breaks).

I wish that they made the video longer instead of making the moves so rushed.  Yoga is suppose to relax you not rush you.  My class in the YMCA is 1 hour this workout was only 52 minutes (two separate beginner and full workout not sure how long each is).  Why so short???  With proper directions and completing the move time needs to be included!!  She did not even give any breaks for water.  There should be time added for this because it is very important.

I even watched some youtube video of Ann Pringle and these were brief also so I guess I should of known.  I just figured this was a youtube so she could not do as much in this media.

Maybe after I do the video more often I will be happier.  Next time, I will try to complete the beginner and the full program to see if this is more satisfying.  I am sure after repeating the video I will also know the moves better and hopefully they will not feel so rushed:))))",1330128000,6,1829,4.26530612244898

3376203,5,B00158NCX8,"Update 1-23-13 - I still use this program almost daily 19 months later and plan to the rest of my life.  The length of the program, the moves included and the measured deep breathing throughout are exactly what I need to keep going.  I've tried about every other senior yoga program there is and don't like any of them except for John Schorletzer (sp?) Ageless Yoga which I sometimes alternate with - his really isn't yoga but a gentle exercise program that increases mobility which I also need.  Anne's is true healing Iyengar yoga and I don't think you can find anything better. :o)

My review from 8-2-11 not long after I started it:  I highly recommend this program by Anne Burnell for anyone with fibromyalgia.  It is not advertised for FMS, but it should be - it has worked an absolute miracle on me.  I've tried a couple of other DVDs and both made the pain much worse.  19 years of ""fibro-fog"" disappeared during the very first session 7 weeks ago, and hasn't returned.  Headaches and chest pains (anyone with FMS will know what I'm talking about) were gone after two sessions, crippling back pain was nearly gone by two weeks.  I could also bend over to pick up something out of the floor with no pain for the first time in 8 years.  Amazing improvements in flexibility and energy level allow me to spend some time on enjoyable craft projects now instead of spending all my time on the sofa taking non-restorative naps.  It doesn't cure FMS, but it keeps the symptoms at bay temporarily if I faithfully do it first thing in the morning.  Certain activities can cause flareups of back pain and fatigue as before, but not as severe, and the next session will usually settle it back down.

This is true healing yoga on a simplified scale. I don't understand how something that looks so easy can have any affect on your well-being, but it definitely does. Soothing music and a beginning relaxation session get your body and mind ready for the exercises.  Easy gentle moves all while seated in a chair with emphasis on deep breathing gets oxygen to all the muscles that are being stretched and creates the miracle :o)  And the time flies by - total of 40 minutes including the ending relaxation, but it seems more like only 5 minutes have passed so don't be afraid it will take too long and that you will get bored.  It's the best 40 minutes I could ever spend. I haven't gone past the basic session yet but hope to soon start making use of Anne's other DVD set for seniors, called Stretch & Strength, on alternate days.  I had so much improvement in the first couple of weeks I have since bought 8 DVDs as gifts for family and friends that I thought might get some benefit from it.  Before receiving this DVD,  I thought the rest of my life would be spent on the sofa. Thank you Anne for saving my life!  Namaste!",1312243200,125,2818,4.475538160469667
