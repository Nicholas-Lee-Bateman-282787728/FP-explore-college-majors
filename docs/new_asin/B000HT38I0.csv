2643472,5,B000HT38I0,"Perhaps it has been the success of other, recent Randolph Scott Westerns being released this past year on DVD, but now Warner Brothers is releasing in very reasonably priced triple-headers two 3-film packs of classic Scott Westerns from the 1950s, and it is indeed great news for fans of the classic ""little A"" Western, and of Randolph Scott, who in many ways epitomized the Western star of the 1940s and '50s.  These three titles can be purchased together with three more in another set for a pitance. Although the Warner Scotts were not generally superior to the Columbia products, they were still superior Westerns and very entertaining, filled with action and the kind of dramatic adventure so treasured by fans of the genre. Several, including COLT.45, FORT WORTH, and RIDING SHOTGUN, are very good. Here's hoping that Warner will release CARSON CITY (one of the best from the early 50s), SUGARFOOT, and THE BOUNTY HUNTER...and if they have it, WESTBOUND, one of the seven Budd Boetticher directed Scott films. I'd even enjoy seeing the much-maligned SHOOT-OUT AT MEDICINE BEND (with a young James Garner)!

Thanks, Warner Brothers!",1157760000,52,1137,5.074866310160428
2643473,4,B000HT38I0,"Randolph Scott's contributions to the western from 1945-1962 are second to none. His teaming with producer Harry Joe Brown from 1947 produced several superior programmers for Columbia up to 1959, many of them directed by solid craftsmen like Ray Enright and Gordon Douglas but the best of them helmed first by the intelligent and talented Andre De Toth, then by Budd Boetticher, whose Ranown series of virile, lean chamber works (justifiably acclaimed as miniature masterpieces) provided, along with Sam Peckinpah's Ride the High Country an ideal book end to Scott's honorable career. Reprehensibly, apart from the beautifully restored Paramount/Batjac release of Seven Men from Now, none of the Boetticher-Scott westerns is presently available on DVD.

Columbia have nevertheless released a steady flow of the Scotts, for which we must be thankful. It has certainly been great to have titles like Man in the Saddle, A Lawless Street, and Hangman's Knot in the DVD catalogue.

These 2 new Warner Triple Bills are terrific news for the legions of Scott fans: the Warner Scotts, never before surfacing on DVD, contain some of the most enjoyable entries including the tough Colt 45, some well-directed De Toths like Riding Shotgun and Thunder Over the Plains and the traditional but highly entertaining Tall Man Riding. Indeed the taut, suspenseful Riding Shotgun is one of the very best ""wrongly accused holed-up in a hostile town"" westerns with superbly staged action. Scott is excellent as always, but Wayne Morris lends sterling support as the hapless sheriff caught up in the middle of a conflict he'd rather be out of.  I hope Warner issues another set-the sooner the better-that contains some of its remaining Scotts like The Bounty Hunter, Sugarfoot and Westbound (the last film in particular, directed by Boetticher, is a genuine curiosity).",1156723200,50,1847,5.233108108108108

I truly enjoy the westerns of the 50's and these fit the bill. I find myself having issues with all the unrealistic action in todays movies as it's a turn off for me. These movies are believable and very entertaining to say the least. The best part is the filming is great and the camera is not strapped to someone's back while there running around filming!!!!

They take me back to Saturday mornings in the '60s, watching TV, drinking CoolAid with a peanut butter sandwich, and basking in the warm glow of a school-free weekend.  Scott's pictures were always airy and exciting.  There always seemed to be at least two ladies vying for his attention.  And he wound up being the hero most of the time.  There were plenty of horses and scenery, and a smattering of sage philosophy.

Another very interesting Andr de Toth western that shows us why the Hungarian born director should be praised as much as John Ford, Howard Hawks or Raoul Walsh.

2643537,5,B000HT38I0,"This somewhat suspenseful 1953 film explores the feelings that northerners have to the southerners who lost the Civil War and the southerners' feelings about the northern occupation of their land. It is 1869 in a Texas county. All but two states have rejoined the union after the Civil War, Texas is one of the two. The District Tax Commissioner from the north taxes the local land owners to the extent that they must sell their cotton at an extremely reduced price to pay the taxes. A northern cotton dealer who is in cahoots with the Commissioner buys the cotton and transports it north where it is sold for about ten times what he paid. The locals are incensed. Ben Weston is their Robin Hood. He and his band live in the woods and raid the caravans carrying the cotton. They take the cotton, but kill no one, so they aren't all that bad.

 Randolph Scott plays a Union captain who was born in the area but fought with the north. He is assigned to the local fort and told to capture Weston. He feels for the locals and dislikes the Commissioner and the dealer. He does no more than what he is told to do. The fort's colonel brings in reinforcements led by a captain who dislikes southerners and has no compunctions against shooting and killing them. The captain tries to seduce Scott's wife who is dissatisfied living in this small western town.

 The cotton dealer kills a man and arranges that Weston should be blamed. The colonel orders Scott and the reinforcement captain to capture Weston. After the matter is resolved, Texas reenters the union in 1870.",1302652800,,1561,4.60431654676259
2643538,3,B000HT38I0,"I have to confess I'm not as enthusiastic about these films as most of the other reviewers here. I've seen many Randolph Scott westerns and I tend to enjoy them, so I was looking forward to these high-quality studio transfers of three early 1950s color westerns from Warner Bros. I found THE MAN BEHIND THE GUN to be the most compelling of the three, but even it suffers from contrived scripting, while the other two are only a cut above B-westerns, with weak scripts and cheap production undermining Scott's sterling performances.

THE MAN BEHIND THE GUN (1952) deals with water rights in Los Angeles in the 1850s, in a plot that foreshadows Roman Polanski's CHINATOWN (1974), going so far as to include an actor (Roy Roberts) who also appears in CHINATOWN, also as a politician.  A lot of plot elements come into play, including some forced comic relief from Dick Wesson and Alan Hale Jr. and a forced love triangle involving Scott, a fellow officer (Philip Carey), and the officer's fiancee (Patrice Wymore). The best scenes involve two Latino performers: singer Lina Romay as a femme fatale trying to recruit Scott, and Robert Cabal as famed Mexican outlaw Joaquin Murietta, who starts out on the wrong side but elects to join with Scott. Most of it was shot on studio sets, with a burst of outdoor action at the end as the army raids the water pirates' camp. Some stock footage from DODGE CITY (1939) is used. It's far-fetched at times, but the pace never flags, there's plenty of action, and the solid supporting cast also includes such dependables as Morris Ankrum, Douglas Fowley, and Anthony Caruso.

THUNDER OVER THE PLAINS (1953) is set in post-Civil War Texas in 1869 and focuses on conflict between Texan farmers and Northern Carpetbaggers, with occupying troops from the Union Army caught in the middle. It's a promising set-up, but the Carpetbagger villains, played by Hugh Sanders and Elisha Cook Jr., are not terribly formidable and the final confrontation is pretty feeble. The film was shot on a western town set on a California ranch that Warner owned and the action never strays far from the set, so it never quite looks or feels like Texas. There's supposed to be an army fort adjacent to the town but all we ever see is a big wooden gate through which the soldiers enter, only to be seen next in the cramped interior of the Colonel's office. Lex Barker, fresh off of playing Tarzan, portrays an Eastern officer sent to serve under Captain Porter (Scott), but he proves too trigger-happy in dealing with the native Texans and a little too quick to put the moves on Scott's pretty, younger wife (Phyllis Kirk). Barker is quite good, but this intriguing subplot is never adequately developed nor ever properly resolved.

RIDING SHOTGUN (1954) offers Scott as a stagecoach guard who gets accused of complicity in a stage robbery. Despite the title, 90% of the film takes place in town, all shot on the Warner studio's western backlot as Scott fends off the townspeople's hostility towards him. The sheriff is out on posse duty chasing down the actual stage robbers, so the townsfolk decide to wait Scott out. In the course of an hour (out of a 74-minute running time), nobody actually DOES anything, despite Scott's attempts to warn them of an impending raid by the robbery gang, whose leader (James Millican) was waiting for the posse to ride out before doubling back to hit the gambling hall. Given all the talk in the film, this could easily have been a TV show. The action finale in the gambling hall almost redeems it when Scott shoots it out with the robbery gang, which includes a 31-year old Charles Bronson, who made three other westerns that year (VERA CRUZ, APACHE, DRUM BEAT), all far superior to this one.

I'm happy to see DVD box sets with multiple westerns like these, but there are so many better films from that period waiting to be released, e.g. CARSON CITY, also with Scott and also directed by Andre De Toth, as someone else here has also mentioned. I'd love to see a Joel McCrea box set with titles like WICHITA, FORT MASSACRE and GUNFIGHT AT DODGE CITY, among others. And I'd welcome box sets from Paramount with films like WARPATH, SILVER CITY, PONY EXPRESS and DENVER & RIO GRANDE, or an Alan Ladd set (WHISPERING SMITH, BRANDED, RED MOUNTAIN, etc.). Just some suggestions.",1289692800,5,4318,4.752
2643539,5,B000HT38I0,"Both of the Warners Randolph Scott 3-fers are well worth owning for fans of the star or 50s westerns in general - the other release consists of COLT .45, TALL MAN RIDING, and FORT WORTH - but if you are only getting one, this would be it, as all three of the films on display here are excellent and not too far off the level of Scott's great work at the end of the decade with Budd Boetticher.  It's a no-frills set and the transfers aren't flawless, but they're perfectly fine and for this price, you just can't go wrong.  Here's what you get:

THE MAN BEHIND THE GUN (1953, directed by Felix Feist)
THE MAN BEHIND THE GUN has got to be one of the more unusual westerns I've seen lately - and I've been watching a lot of westerns.  Randolph Scott stars as Major Ransome Callicut, a man on a secret mission in southern California before the Civil War, trying to help preserve the state's fragile ""free"" status and also to uncover a group of plotters and arms merchants potentially involved in undermining the Union.  A serious story - but Scott moves through the film in a charming, upbeat, humorous way - all the while narrating the thing in a style more typical of film noir!  And the film has lots of other interesting touches that struck me as noirish - it's basically a big conspiracy of double-crossing and intrigues, with two women both vying at the same time (maybe?) for Scott and Philip Carye's Captain Roy Giles, a southern sympathizer who is nonetheless determined to do his duty as a US officer.

Added onto these basics we've got Dick Wesson as Sgt. ""Monk"" Walker, a whip-wielding, wise-cracking malcontent who spends a fair chunk of the film in drag - we've got Alan Hale Jr (you know him as the Skipper from Gilligan's Island) as Monk's buddy Corporal Olaf Swenson who at one point does a strongman routine - we've got a devious Senator and his spinster sister who knows his secret - a hair-pulling catfight - a knife-throwing Mexican double agent - a plot to control California's water supply (shades of CHINATOWN, anybody?) and enough turnabouts and faked identities that I lost track more than once as to who the bad guys and good guys (apart from Scott, of course) were.  Felix Feist's direction isn't really anything special, but the whole artificial feel of it, the bad old dangerous L.A. that's simultaneously a wild-west town and a proto-modern city of criminals and private dicks, the bright colors and Randolph Scott's big smile and the gunplay and explosions and the general chaos of the thing just had me enthralled from the very beginning.  No point in trying to make sense of it, this is just an over-the-top, everything goes b-western that is spectacularly underrated and really needs to be seen by any real fans of the genre.

THUNDER OVER THE PLAINS (1953 Andre de Toth)
Here Scott is Captain David Porter of the U.S. Army, charged with helping keep order under martial law in Texas just after the Civil War before the rebel state has been readmitted into the Union.  He's got a lot to contend with - the carpetbaggers are bleeding the Texans - mostly loyally Unionists in this area - dry, his friend Ben Westman (Charles McGraw) is apparently the leader of an armed group of bandits seeking to scare away the Yankees, his wife Norah (Phyllis Kirk) longs for a life back east, and he's got a younger punk Captain, Bill Hodges (Lex Barker) vying with him for authority even as their superior officer, Colonel Chandler (Henry Hull) is getting tired of the ""coddling"" of the angry native Texans by Porter and his troops.

There's an awful lot of action in this 82-minute film, but De Toth gives up enough time for some solid character development and a real feel for the conflicting loyalties that a man like Porter - a Texan born and raised but a square-shooting Union officer throughout the war - would feel.  I haven't seen any of this director's films in a good while and can't say if his style here is typical, but whether it is or not it's very impressive.  The director shoots in mostly close-ups or close-medium shots - though we do get some decent landscape shots this isn't De Toth's interest here, he keeps the camera squarely on the action and on the faces.  There are sequences with longish shots that feel almost handheld and seem to belong to a period a couple of decades later, an intimacy here that one rarely finds in westerns of this period.  One really terrific sequence has a turncoat among the Texans leaving a jail, fearing for his life as the camera follows his face in closeup, sweating and nervously flicking his gaze in every direction, as he walks down the street to his eventual, expected demise.

Also on hand are the always welcome Elisha Cook Jr as one of the carpetbaggers, and Fess Parker in an early appearance (pre-Davy Crockett or Daniel Boone) as one of Westman's henchmen.  The only real problem the film has is that, having set up an almost impossibly complex situation for Scott's character - who eventually goes outside the law to try to exonerate a jailed and to-be-hanged Westman - it solves everything in one climactic gunfight, and a tossed-off narrated epilogue.  The gunfight is beautifully done in and of itself, but plenty of questions remain.  Oh well, you can't expect everything in such a cheap genre film from this era and the film overall very much delivers.

RIDING SHOTGUN (1954 Andre De Toth)
This taut and suspenseful thriller might be the gem of the package.  Scott plays Larry Delong, a gun-for-hire who's been riding shotgun (for once the title has real meaning) on stagecoaches for a couple of years, hoping to catch up with a bandit who he's been gunning for.  As the film opens the Dan Maraday (James Millican), the bad guy, is planning on holding up a bank-casino in the town of Deepwater and concocts a plan to get the town's sherriff and most of its able-bodied men away from town - and to implicate Delong in robbing the stagecoach he's actually protecting.  There's a good action sequence as Delong is beat down by several of Maraday's tough guys, but to the bad guys' ultimate downfall left alive by the vengeful Pinto (a young Charles Bronson).

Delong eventually escapes his predicament and rides back into town, trying to warn the people of Maraday's plans, but the damage to his reputation has been done - he's seen as a deserter from the sheriff's posse, or even worse, a member of the gang, and the citizens aren't willing to believe in the robbers' complex plans as he outlines them.  The confusion and anger soon reaches a fever pitch, with only Delong's girlfriend Orissa (Joan Weldon) believing in him; eventually he has to hole up in a cantina owned by Fritz (Fritz Feld) the trilingual owner of the seedy place - who is also at the least two-sided in his loyalties.  The sheriff's senior deputy, Tub (Wayne Morris), left alone in charge of the town - and a friend of Delong's who also doesn't really believe that he's a villain - now has to prevent anyone in the town from lynching him, or anyone from getting killed.  Eventually, of course, Maraday and his gang come back into town to do exactly what Delong knows they will.

This is a really well-done and sadly under-seen variation on the one-man-against-the-town theme, a fairly common plot in both westerns and thriller/noir of the 50s.  High Noon is obviously the best-known example, but Scott did a similar piece again a few years later with Budd Boetticher in the better-known Decision at Sundown and John Payne stars in a somewhat more overtly anti-McCarthy example in the same year, 1954, the Allan Dwan-directed Silver Lode.  What such films lack in the pictorial splendors of the west they can easily make up for in tension and characterization, and Riding Shotgun manages this in spades.  About half of the film sees Scott confined to one room, but, having learned what we need to know about his character we're now free to focus on the divided loyalties of deputy Tub and the lynch-happy and basically sheep-like townspeople, much more interested in getting rid of this single dangerous man now than worrying about any potential future violence that he's warning them about.  Riding Shotgun ultimately seems more about human shortsightedness and the readiness people often have to believe in easy answers rather than complex solutions that require real work on their part.

Scott is quite fine playing a fairly typical character, and conveys a mood of exasperation throughout the film that mirrors that of the townspeople ultimately too pigheaded to pay attention to him.  Feld and Millican also stand out as the weaselly bar owner and lead villain, but it's Morris as deputy Tub who really takes the prize.  The large and somewhat portly actor is today best-known as the cowardly Lt. Roget in Paths of Glory, but he was a staple in low-budget westerns of this period and a fine actor who easily turns what could have been a very simple comic role into something much more significant as the second moral center of the film, mirroring the more serious and hotheaded Delong.  Andre DeToth again emphasizes the close-up and also shows an excellent understanding of filmic space in this tightly wound and tightly shot piece, and comes up with something that is pretty close to brilliant here, with not a wasted moment.",1267228800,,9292,4.717109326744905
2643540,3,B000HT38I0,"This set has an excellent price, three Randolph Scott movies for the price of one! How much better does it get? Scott was the king of the B Western; they were generally shorter & had lesser names for actors but they were entertaining. All three of these films were from the fifties, Scott's hay day, & the B Western's biggest decade.

The Man Behind the Gun takes place in Los Angeles, California, before the beginning of the Civil War. Callicut (Scott) is in the Army but he arrives in L.A. as an undercover agent with the mission of thwarting some secessionists. The supporting cast includes Patrice Wymore, Dick Wesson & Philip Carey. Robert Cabal (Rawhide) has a small role as the outlaw, Joaquin Murietta, who ends up giving aid to Callicut.

Thunder Over the Plains takes place in Texas after the Civil War. Capt. David Porter (Scott) is in command of a cavalry detachment that's responsible for maintaining control. But Porter is a Texan, loyal to the government, who detests what the Carpetbaggers are doing to his state.  This film is fairly intricate in its plot, unusual for a B Western. The film also features Phyllis Kirk (Norah, Porter's wife), Lex Barker (Capt. Bill Hodges) who knew Nora from back East & attempts to seduce her, & Charles McGraw (Ben Westman, a Texas patriot & outlaw). Elisha Cook, Jr. has a featured role & Fess Parker has a small one.

Riding Shotgun is unusual for a B Western, it borders on being an ""adult"" psychological Western. Larry DeLong (Scott) has been riding shotgun for nearly every stage line in the West, seeking his revenge on one outlaw, Dan Marady (James Millican). Through a set up, DeLong is lured from the stage station & captured by the outlaw gang. They leave him behind tied up & then rob the stage. The gang is also going to doubleback & rob the unprotected town. DeLong frees himself, returns to town & tries to warn them that Marady is coming there. Few believe him, in fact, they think he's part of the gang. It's pretty tense for a B Western. The cast features Wayne Morris (Tub Murphy), Joan Weldon (Orissa Flynn) & Joe Sawyer (Tom Biggert). The cast includes Charle Buchinsky (aka Charles Bronson).

All three films are in excellent condition. All three are in the full screen format. There aren't any bonus features not even subtitles.",1235260800,9,2302,4.702233250620347

2643552,4,B000HT38I0,"Another triple feature from Warner Bros spotlights three Randolph Scott flicks.  Expect action, gunplay,and some humor in all these.  Look for lots of familiar faces like Philip Carey (from General Hospital, I believe), Alan Hale Jr.(Skipper from Gilligan's Island) and Charles Buchinsky (better known as Charles Bronson).  Randolph Scott is the picture of your western hero, broad in the shoulder, long and lean with a slow drawl.  The plots are more mature than just a shoot-em-up.  The best part is three good movies for the price of one.  The transfers are excellent.  The photography in these shows is beautiful.  The price is worth just watching the scenery.  If you ever liked the old time western, entertainment the family can watch, do not pass this up.",1170028800,7,762,5.032
2643553,4,B000HT38I0,"Really liked the triple feature here. These technicolor films all look and sound great but there are no extras-not even menus. The movies themselves are really what matter and they are well made old-fashioned Hollywood westerns. Thunder on the Plains is by far the best film which goes beyond the reins of the genre with more realistic and serious characters, intense action, real suspense and outstanding photography. Also, Thunder features two great supporting actors, Henry Hull as a cavalry major and Lex Baxter as the young rival! One of the best Randy Scott movies I've ever seen. The other two films are like icing on the cake. The simultaneous release of a second triple feature with Colt .45 and Fort Worth is also a great deal.",1169510400,5,737,4.857142857142857
2643554,4,B000HT38I0,"Anyone with a good knowledge of Randolph Scott's movie career, would welcome these three additions to his list of westerns available at last on dvd. I remember seeing these movies in theatres as a teenager, and time has not changed them. They each stand up today, as well as they did when released in the 1950's. Anybody with a yearning towards the Hollywood version of the Americian west, (not the real west), like me, will enjoy these movies. A great example of western movie making at it's best, without the need to resort to four letter words and blood splatted violence, to put the story over. (think TV's Deadwood, yuk!). The prints are so clear and in such beautiful condition, that I can't wait to see what will be released next. Pure entertainment, and three movies on one two sided disc is fantastic value. Happy viewing, Frank Harris.",1168905600,8,845,4.716216216216216
2643555,5,B000HT38I0,"I would just like to chime in with all the positive reviews here. These  B-westerns are very enjoyable -- westerns the way they used to be made way back when the body count was relatively low and the characterization drove the story forward.

""Riding Shotgun"" is the stand out story here but the other two aren't bad either. The more I see of Randolph Scott, the more I like his work. When given a decent script and a good director, he could really deliver a fine performance.

This is a bare bones release. There are no extras of any kind -- no scene selection menu, no trailers, no nothin'.

The color looks good and the sound is clear. Sit back, break out the popcorn and enjoy.",1168300800,6,681,4.380952380952381

Mostly churned out quickly and frequently, and so these should be viewed with the Saturday matinee attitude, with buttered popcorn and soda in hand! But man the color is just GREAT!

2643558,5,B000HT38I0,"This time we have THE MAN BEHIND THE GUN (1953), THUNDER OVER THE PLAINS (1953) and RIDING SHOTGUN (1954). Another three cracking little B-Westerns with Scott once again the stoic hero ably supported by the likes of Philip Carey, Lex (Tarzan) Barker & Wayne Morris. Acclaimed director Andre de Toth directed the second and third of these films. He (de Toth) also directed four other Randolph Scott westerns. Another four hours plus of western drama in glorious Technicolor. Best of the Three in my opinion is RIDING SHOTGUN. Good quality DVD transfers and all at a bargain price from Amazon. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for all Randolph Scott fans and western movie aficionados in general.",1165795200,5,680,5.0265486725663715
2643559,4,B000HT38I0,"Another of two three film collections of Randolph Scott Westerns features three solid examples of his work, although Ride Shot gun is by far the best of the three.
The Man Behind The Gun has Scott as an undercover Army officer who is investigating a plot in California to steal the water supply to force the state to be pro-slavery. Alan Hale Jr., Morris Ankrum, Roy Roberts, and Phil Carey lend dignity to the proceedings, and even if it's not one of Scott's best, it's still fairly entertaining. Rating - Three out of five stars.

Thunder Over The Plains - In this film, Scott again plays an army officer, this time trying to keep law and order in post Civil-War Texas, as renegades steal from carpetbaggers. As Scott deals with the tension of being a symbol of tyranny to his fellow Texans, he also has to deal with a young, brash subordinate, played by Lex Barker, who fancies Scott's wife. This film is entertaining, and better than most of Scott's non-Budd Boetticher films. Rating - Four out of five stars.

Riding Shotgun - This standout of the three included films features Scott in his tried and true posture as a man set on revenge. Scott plays a shotgun rider for a stagecoach line who's pursuing the men that killed his sister and nephew. The gang waylays Scott and robs the stagecoach he is supposed to be on as a ruse to draw a posse out of the town that the stagecoach is heading for, all with the purpose of robbing the town casino with all of the able-bodied men out of town. Scott gets free, and heads to the town, where he tries to warn the townspeople of the impending robbery, but is regarded with suspicion as having been an accomplice to the stage robbery and the murder of the man riding shotgun in Scott's place.

Scott and the cast is entertaining, and Charles Bronson (using his real name of Buchinsky) is great as the gang leader's chief lieutenant. This has many of the elements of Scott's best films, and is thoroughly enjoyable. Rating - Five out of five stars.",1165622400,19,1993,4.530555555555556
