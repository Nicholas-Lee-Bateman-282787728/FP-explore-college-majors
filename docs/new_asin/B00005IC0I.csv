8372275,5,B00005IC0I,"The story begins to move faster once Lafiel and Jinto (mostly Lafiel) finish dealing with the Baron of Febdash. War becomes a much greater focus and we see as yet even more of the differences in thinking between the Abh and human races, as presented by the different ways Lafiel and Jinto approach things.
This disc contains three episodes. Episode 8 wraps up the Febdash storyline, while episode 9 and 10 deal with the pair ending up on a enemy occupied planet. As if the physical aspects of being on a planet weren't enough of a challenge to the space-born and bred Lafiel, having to assimilate and hide in human culture presents problems that she cannot even begin to anticipate.
This is where Jinto finally gets his time in the sun as he is now the one in familiar surroundings and no longer paralyzed by uncertainty. The story further develops the relationship between the two.
One thing I like about this story is the issues and situations that the story attempts to deal with. As much as possible, they have tried to make characters and people react in a realistic way. There are parallels between the surrender of Jinto's home planet to the Abh with Japan's surrender to the allies, the occupation of Sufugnoff with World War II occupation of cities by various forces. The world is rich, believable and all too compelling. I am eagerly awaiting the fourth disc in this series.",1003881600,4,1384,4.699588477366255
8372276,5,B00005IC0I,"The way the US release of Crest of the Stars goes always makes the last episode of each volume the start of a new arc.  Lamirh and Ghint's stay at the Barony of Febdaush is concluded and the focus is shifting towards the brewing war against the Abh Humanoid Reich and the 4 Nation Alliance.  The empire has sent two of its best fleets, commanded by the wild Spaurh and noble Traif to defend the Kingdom of Sphagnouf.  This volume ends before the conflict at Sphagnouf is resolved, continuing the trend to ""break arcs"" so to speak.  The battle scenes in the volume are all very well directed and the plot's pace starts to accelerate. Once again, I recommend this series to all space opera maniacs and sci-fi fans.",989798400,5,712,4.496124031007752
