8654072,1,B00JVU3JJ4,A 2014 indie DVD. Good opening credits. This blonde that has come in from jogging has a fantastic body. I don't rate the acting. The special effects are good. It seems to bore me. There is a mysterious pretty woman named Bella/Baylah or something. There is a dream sequence where she and the hot wife Brenda kiss. Possibly the only highlight of this film. I am hoping that they would have sex. This film is just bizarre. I might just skip a chapter or fast forward to a good part.,1458259200,,480,4.344444444444444
