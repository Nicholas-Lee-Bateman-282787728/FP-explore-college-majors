8413806,1,B0042KZK1I,The only reason I HAD to get this movie is because while scouring IMDB I was lead to believe it starred the same Michelle Michaels from the classic Slumber Party Massacre. Alas it was a completely different actress with a clever name.  I still managed to get through this coming of age tale of 3 friends reunited after graduation.  Not the best but interesting watching what a doggone jerk one of the three leads was and still managed to have people around that didn't just shoot him. Free or dirt cheap= worth the price of admission. Otherwise no.,1515974400,,548,4.581632653061225
