7856444,5,6303814832,"This a great video collection well worth getting even though it's only a half hour- it's good to the last minute! It contains all four CrazySexyCool videos (""Creep"", ""Red Light Special"", ""Waterfalls"", and ""Diggin' On You"") along with some short interviews, discussions and footage, and a decent documentary on the making of ""Waterfalls"". (If you ask me, I think the best songs on the album are the ones that WEREN'T released!) It also exposes the beauty and cuteness and good-humoured friendliness of the three girls which makes watching this enjoyable, especially Left Eye. She is just too adorable! I thought she looked the coolest in the ""Creep"" video and how she portrayed herself as a ""pimp"" instead of some ditzy sex object in ""Red Light Special."" There's too much more to say about the CrazySexyCool video and album, so I'm going to stop here. But I will say this: If you're a TLC fan and/or like seeing them at their best, buy this! You won't be dissapointed. (By the way, my public nickname's ""liyah5"", not ""a viewer"".) * I am very saddened by the news about Lisa's car crash fatality but let's all remember she's in a better place now.*",1010102400,26,1146,4.735
