8274201,3,B0019KAQ7M,"HOLLYWOOD's GREATEST VILLAINS is a two-hour History Channel presentation (minus commercial breaks, approx. 100 minutes). The program is divided into chapters that clearly begin after adv. pauses. Because this dub is flawed (at all times, audio is  to 1 second behind the picture), it only gets a three star rating.

Actor and director commentary accompanies the dozens of film clips, from 1903 to the 21st Century.
Following an extended intro that includes an exploration of Darth Vader from STAR WARS, there's sections on---
COWBOY VILLAINS; GANGSTER VILLAINS, WAR VILLAINS; SUPER VILLAINS; LADY VILLAINS; PSYCHO VILLAINS; MONSTER VILLAINS; SPACE VILLAINS.

The point is early made that villains are engines that propel the story and are flawed people like all of us, while heroes tend to be limited in scope and are less real. Sharon Stone compares the bad guy to a cobra that watches, waits, waits, waits, waits and STRIKES! Bruce Davison recalls a time when he lost out on a film's hero role but was offered the villain part and felt disappointed. Director Robert Aldrich explained to him that actors who play heroes last maybe six years, but specialists in villainy can raise a family in Hollywood and be active into old age.

Robert Patrick remembers being a young unknown hired to portray the evil cyborg in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TERMINATOR-2-JUDGMENT-DAY/dp/B00004TRD8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY</a>&nbsp;(1991). He explains how he arrived at this scary machine's way of behaving.

There's sections on Bond film villians from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DR-NO/dp/B000RPCK10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DR.

Always of highest interest are film clips, photo montages and excerpts of movie trailers, like two where Sydney Greenstreet directly addresses the audience. If you can get past that unsynchronous video/audio transfer (don't stare at their mouths!) HOLLYWOOD'S GREATEST VILLIANS is a most interesting show.
