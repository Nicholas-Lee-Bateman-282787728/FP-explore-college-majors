8145678,3,B000IJ7AC4,The original over New England is a nice relaxing look at New England. The Cape Cod videos etc... are a bit dated.,1428451200,,113,4.181818181818182
8145679,5,B000IJ7AC4,This is a great tour of New England. The Cape Cod dvd is the best (you've got to see the whales :) But the whole set is a great exploration of the New England I love. We have friends from England you come and visit and they take these dvds back home to show their friend what they've seen. SO much better then just taking pictures. I highly reccomed this set.

8145680,5,B000IJ7AC4,This is a nice introduction to New England.  The footage is clear and beautiful. I have sent this dvd set to relatives abroad so they can see where we live.,1193443200,,156,4.2
8145681,2,B000IJ7AC4,4 Disc set-one of the dvd discs skipped and then just froze after about 5 minutes of playtime.  I have sent the set back for reimbursement and we'll see how that goes...very dissappointed.,1193443200,,188,4.696969696969697
8145682,1,B000IJ7AC4,"Don't expect a colorful, scenic view of the northeast. These old TV shows range from mediocre to juvenile. The ""Cape Cod"" scenes with music (no narration) is probably the best.",1186963200,2,176,4.9
8145683,5,B000IJ7AC4,"This is incredible footage of New England, alot in fall and all her glory. You will

watch this over and over again. The beauty is breathtaking, and what is better

than a flyover?",1172016000,5,180,4.424242424242424
8145684,5,B000IJ7AC4,"I love New England and this set of videos represents home to me.  Great footage, I am getting another set as a gift for my dad. The Cape Cod and Fly over DVDs are spectacular.",1163030400,4,175,4.0
