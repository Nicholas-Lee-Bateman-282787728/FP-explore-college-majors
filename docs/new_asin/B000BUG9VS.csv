2442383,5,B000BUG9VS,"Employing an accomplished television parlance, Daniel Minahan's SERIES 7: THE CONTENDERS mixes the gritty vrit of ""COPS"" with a hyperbolized competition that dwarfs the contests of television shows like ""Survivor,"" ""The Mole,"" or ""The Runner"" (the latter ultimately deemed ""too sensitive"" for production).  Shot on digital video, SERIES 7 stars Brooke Smith as Dawn Logarto, an expectant mother and reigning champion of this horrific competition wherein six randomly chosen civilians struggle to kill off their opponents.  Their prize?  Nothing more than staying alive and fighting in SERIES 8.  Keeping the details of the contest sketchy keeps SERIES 7 from becoming a science fiction story and, in turn, gives it more punch.

  Director Minahan presents SERIES 7 as a full season of a program boiled down to a tight 87-minute running time.  As with actual television programs of its ilk, SERIES 7 creates drama in its presentation.  The contestants come from vastly different backgrounds--from the ""Angel of Death"" nurse, Connie (Marylouise Burke), to the blowhard loser, Tony (Michael Kaycheck).  Minahan drives further into television faux-reality by placing SERIES 7 in Dawn's home town and making one of the contestants an old high school flame--Jeffrey Norman (Glenn Fitzgerald), a terminally ill artist with a long-suffering, manipulative wife (Angelina Phillips).

  SERIES 7 presents characters in rapid-fire shorthand but, remarkably, none of them come off as stereotypes.  Rather, they're infectiously enjoyable and become so familiar so fast that the audience can invest in them (save for the underplayed Frank (Richard Venture), a conspiracy theorist).

  By consciously employing the clichs of ""reality shows,"" Minahan brings to fore commentary about the desires of today's audiences while not overpowering the film's narrative.  Indeed, audiences have found SERIES 7 disturbing in the film's ability to minister to and underscore the undeniable bloodlust that prevails in today's ""enlightened"" society.

SERIES 7: THE CONTENDERS succeeds in every milieu it invades.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about its distributor, USA Films.  Except for ""key markets,"" SERIES 7 played in few U.S. venues.  It seems that USA hoped to shirk any potential controversy that this insightfully violent film could incur.  After avoiding several major film festivals, USA dumped the film onto video and DVD in late 2001--not bothering to make the film available to several major retailers or to update the film's well-crafted website with this information.",1149120000,3,2562,5.580310880829016
2442384,5,B000BUG9VS,"Wow!  This movie blew me away.  One of the best mock-umentories EVER!! (Trailer Park Boys is great too) If you've ever wondered what it would be like to be in a position where you have to kill or be killed, you must see Series 7: The Contenders!

2442385,5,B000BUG9VS,"I find all ""reality"" shows to be exceptionally tedious, and movies about ""reality"" shows even more so (Mary-Kate & Ashley Olsen in ""The Challenge""? Bor-ring!). This movie, however, was pretty good. Basically, it's 5 people set loose on the streets of Danbury, CT (so close to home!), armed and dangerous (they're issued a 9mm semi-automatic pistol at the start of the show, but it's no-holds-barred from there), and licenced to kill...each other.

One of my favorite scenes was at the mall, where the contestants were all drawn by a phony note. The young girl ""Lindsay Berns"" (Merritt Wever) not only had her pistol, but an M-16 (semi-auto only), a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun *and* a bulletproof vest (a gift from her boyfriend). She winds up being beaten to death with a metal cane (*severe* head trauma), by the older guy, Franklin James (Richard Venture). He is then shot by Connie Trabucco (Marylouise Burke), who is wielding a sniper's rifle. You won't see *that* on ""Big Brother"" or ""Survivor""!

Overall, very solid entertainment, even though it loses points by being a fake ""reality"" show (SEE: ""Joe Schmoe"", ""Scare Tactics"", etc.). My rating: 7/10.",1141689600,3,1158,5.057591623036649
2442386,5,B000BUG9VS,"This was a phenomenal film. Wicked and hateful satire, extremely black comedy, content which seemed at times over the top but retained its credibility all woven together into a nightmarish suburban landscape.

The film's premise is simple: There's a gameshow, called The Contenders. It's currently shooting season 7. You ""win"" your way onto the gameshow by a national lottery, and you have no recourse but to enter, even if you don't really want to play.

The downside is that the game is Last Man Standing. Each of the seven contenders is given a gun and a cameraman to catch the action, and they have to hunt each other down. The last one standing moves into series 8.

Theoretically, with the dearth of reality shows around, this is an extreme scenario which may need to be employed purely to hook viewers. This is the main theme of the film - violence for spectators. Conceptually, perhaps, not that different to The Running Man - in that film, convicts on Death Row are given an opportunity to play for their lives against futuristic Gladiators who have all the celebrity of today's pro-wrestlers. Series 7, however, has none of that glamour. It's set in the here and now, and all anyone unlucky enough to be in it wants is to get out alive. While some are quietly confident, each character has a sense of dread about the show, and rightfully so.

The filmmakers, though, have gone one step beyond that, and stereotyped the Contenders into recognisable moulds. Dawn is the reigning champion, pregnant and unmarried, with some history of a turbulent childhood. Tony is an angry old man who has no intention of playing the game. Jeff is Dawn's childhood friend, unhappily married now and currently dying of cancer and preparing to commit suicide. Connie is a conniving nurse with delusions of grandeur who seems to have thought more about a gameplan than anyone else. Lindsay is just a teenager, only just old enough to enter, who thinks it's quite cool and whose parents have aspirations of her winning fame and fortune on the show, to the point where they drive her around looking for her victims and get her revved up to kill in the car. They also buy her an extra gun, a big one.

It's not a happy scenario. However, with a hugely upbeat power-punk soundtrack and omnipresent gallows humour, complete with a Rescue 911-type narrator/voice over in the background, the film comes across as gleeful; just good old-fashioned family fun for everyone to enjoy round the TV at night. The fact that it is all so tragic seems not to occur to anyone bar one or two of the contestants.

The characters are richly textured, the plot fast-paced and unpredictable. At times your stomach will turn, at others you will burst out laughing. As the story winds up, and people's attitudes change, the climax comes completely out of left-field to blindside you.

The film is cutting-edge stuff with razor-wire social commentary. The humour, when there, never seems set-up, and there are no ""punchlines"" so you know when to laugh. It all just happens. I found it to be hugely enjoyable indeed; and I think the film tells us a lot about ourselves as a species.

The soundtrack by Girls against Boys is also excellent.",1131580800,6,3201,4.765342960288809
8092872,4,B000BUG9VS,This movie hits my sense of humor right on the dot. A friend and I really enjoy watching this from time to time. We've been talking about making a short film based on the type of story this had. It's never boring and has a bunch of funny twists. Good show. I'd recommend!,1357603200,,271,4.132075471698113
8092873,5,B000BUG9VS,"I'm really surprised this movie did not make a bigger splash.  This was perhaps the precursor of the well known and very popular ""Hunger Games"".  Watch it and you will see the similarities.  I think it stands well on it's own.  Take it in light of an interesting fiction then place yourself in the character's position and it's quite the ride. If you really watch it, you can't help but become emotionally vested in the lead character.  I liked this movie and felt it was too bad that it didn't make it to the big screen.",1352592000,,521,4.385416666666667
8092874,3,B000BUG9VS,"Series 7: The Contenders, is a very twisted black comedy about six contestants on a reality show. The premise of the reality show is that the contestants are given weapons and have to murder each other in order to win. The contestants include a mentally insane man living in a trailer park, a cancer patient, a religious nurse, a high school teenager, a middle-aged father, and (the reigning champion) a pregnant woman. The film is structured as a marathon showing and is played as a series of episodes strung together each following these contestants. The film depicts these people as normal and everyday people who are forced into this terrible situation against their will, but the real meat of the film comes in when we get to learn about the histories of some of these characters. That's the point of the film where the film grows out of being a spoof of reality shows and begins to manifest into a social commentary. The high school teenager has parents who encourage her every step of the way and help her suit up for the murders that she is about to commit. The pregnant woman has been disowned by her own mother due to past incidents. The middle-aged parent has his own troubles at home. There's a lot more going on here than at first glance. This is an angry and dark satire that really challenges some of the concepts of reality and the satire of itself.

There's a lot here that I truly admire. For starters, the performances. They are pretty awful in a way that, at times, seems cringe-worthy. However, when you take a look at reality television shows such as Survivor and The Real World, the acting in those is even worse. It's supposed to be reality, yet the people in them are not believable. That's what makes reality television such a joke, and so in a roundabout way of saying things the performances here are good because the actors are good at capturing the melodramatic mannerisms of the contestants at large. I particularly enjoyed the performance of Brooke Smith as the pregnant woman. She is ridiculously cold and cruel and monstrous, and you can really feel the bitterness that she feels. Yet her mannerisms are so sarcastic and almost pathetic. The same goes for the rest of the cast, but Smith has a visual presence to her that I've always admired. She's a terrific actress. Nobody can forget her performance as the kidnapped victim in The Silence of the Lambs. I've seen some of her television work as well and she almost always sticks out in a good way. Merritt Wever and Glenn Fitzgerald do an equally good job as the teenage girl and the cancer patient, the former being the most likable person in the cast and the latter having all of the best lines and being the most interesting of all the characters. That brings me to another thing I appreciate about this film. These actors are not afraid to embarrass themselves. Most of the characters in this film, lets face it, are completely idiotic and pull some really dumb crap. My favorite parts were when they talked about their lives and how much of an emotional train wreck it's been and how their lives are in tatters. It's so over-the-top and you can't help be think, why on earth would people reveal these things about themselves on television? And it's true, a lot of folks out there will talk about the worst times in their lives just to get attention. It is a joke that this film plays off of several times and it's almost always successful.

My favorite thing about this film, however, has to be the momentum of it. Series 7: The Contenders is almost never boring and there's always something going on. It's virtually impossible to stop watching once you've started, even if you pick up in the middle of it. I think this was done intentionally. I think a lot of televisions shows have that same kind of watchability factor, and what I appreciated the most about this film is that there were no commercials that cut into the action. The satire of the film itself is simple and clever, but even if you put all that aside, you still have one hell of a captivating film. Putting the climax of the film aside, you do get to care about almost all these characters and you don't particularly want to see any of them die really. When the characters do get killed, it is almost always messy, unpleasant, clumsy, and uncoordinated. There's usually a lot of screaming and nasty pain. It's a vicious film when you look at the death scenes, which are more along the lines of the death scenes in a film like Gus Van Sant's Elephant than they are like the death scenes in Cliffhanger. What kept me on my toes the most about these death scenes were that they are almost always unexpected and almost always come as a surprise. As a result, this becomes a rather suspenseful film. It's not the most original film of it's kind, obviously taking cue from The 10th Victim, but it definitely stays with you.

If you want my personal opinion on the film, I cannot say that I like it too much. I don't personally find the film itself to be very funny. I like dark humor, but I thought that this was too sick, really, to be funny. I also really don't like the ending. It felt like I was being beaten over the head by the satire. I also find that the film itself isn't exactly re-watchable. Once you know how it all ends, you really don't have any desire to ever really sit down and watch it. There are films out there that are sick and that you never really WANT to watch again, but at the same time you feel you should and can't help but feel the need to sit through it, but Series 7: The Contenders plays all of it's cards in one sitting and as a result you really don't feel any desire to absorb any of it. It's more the type of film that you just appreciate rather than like and enjoy. I can imagine a lot of horror fan and readers of Fangoria would love it to pieces or at least get a huge kick out of watching it. In my opinion, as brilliant and as clever as it is, I definitely wouldn't advise mainstream moviegoers to watch this. I thought it was a brilliantly directed film in a lot of ways, and the satire was effective, but I can't exactly recommend it. I'm glad I saw it though.",1286409600,,6155,4.454787234042553

8092876,4,B000BUG9VS,"The Bottom Line:

Series 7: The Contenders is a razor-sharp satire of reality television that uses all the trappings of the metier it is skewering to make the film actually seem like a ""marathon"" edition of ""Series 7,"" the hot new show in which middle Americans hunt each other down on camera; the film is often more interesting in conception than in execution but it's still worth a look.

8092877,5,B000BUG9VS,"When it comes to B-rated films, this one tops the list.  'Series 7: The Contenders' is an almost campy parody of reality television, similar to Schwarzenegger's 'Running Man' and Japanese cult classic, 'Battle Royale'

Presented as TV marathon of the 7th season of a reality show, the film takes place in America and the show is called The Contenders. Six people, picked at random from a national lottery, are given guns and forced to hunt and kill each other for the cameras.

It's a dark satire of the reality TV genre. Starring Brooke Smith as Dawn, a pregnant mother and the reigning champion from the fifth and sixth series, 'Series 7: The Contenders' asks the question: 'Is she the monster for killing and doing what it takes to survive, or are we, the viewers, the monsters for entertaining ourselves with tragedy and meaningless death.  Humanity's need to watch things die, from a good safe distance, as Maynard James Keenan once put it, is effectively portrayed with all the campy B-rated fun necessary to make a successful cult classic.

The film is littered with interview segments, commercial previews, complications due to technical error, confrontations with the camera-crew, dramatic re-enactments and cliffhanger promos, giving it the authenticity of a reality TV show.  The film purposely leaves many key details unexplained, as the viewer is supposed to be watching only what the creators actually aired in the fictional TV show. It is not explained how the TV show got into so powerful a position that it could randomly select people to be killed, but all the Contenders treat it as something they have absolutely no control over, which is possibly a reflection of television's influence over society.

The soundtrack is also noteworthy, but I'll stop here.  Just buy the movie, watch something that makes you think for once, and enjoy your purchase.",1219536000,4,1869,5.02588996763754
8092878,5,B000BUG9VS,So hard to find this cult classic movie that should have made it much higher in the box office that it did.

8092879,5,B000BUG9VS,"SERIES 7 is a prescient film about the absurdly illogical conclusion to ""reality"" competition shows.  What's even more amazing is that this film came out before these shows actually had a stranglehold on American prime-time television.

SERIES 7 takes a look at a fictional reality show (like they aren't already) in which contestants survive by, well, surviving.  Last one alive is the winner.  When this movie begins, it's obvious that the ""show"" has been around for several seasons.  I don't want to give away anything because this is one of those films in which every line, scene, and plot point is potentially important and entertaining.  Suffice it to say, the ""show's"" producers find ways to spin events as their ratings require (such as the contestant who chooses to stab ""himself in the back"" as his method of commit suicide).

8092880,4,B000BUG9VS,"This is ""Truman Show"" had it been directed by a dog-off-his-leash Charlton Heston foaming at the bit and handing out ammo like caramel chews from a firetruck at a parade. Basically the same idea as ""Battle Royale"" with a healthy two scoops of the reality TV heart-to-heart confessional booth slop: Five residents of a town and the previous week's winner of The Contender, the top-rated show in the nation, are given guns and told to kill the other players. The prize? Face off next week against five more contestants. The parting gift? Death. A complete fantasy world in which America has embraced its perverse thrill for violence by the scruff of its neck, winners of The Contender are referred to as ""heroes."" Anyone not thoroughly revolted (yet also mesmerized the way eyes are drawn to flashing lights and warm blood racing away from a car crash) by the extreme disregard for life in this world will likely cringe when a love triangle unfolds between the previous week's ""hero"" -- who also happens to be an expecting mother -- a suicidal artist/testicular cancer sufferer (a nod to ""Fight Club?"") who used to be her goth lover/partner in crime in high school, and the artist's wife. ""Series 7"" is a thorough commentary on our cripled society and perhaps its ultimate conclusion: Consumer = disposable product = ultimate entertainment. Too bad it's out of print.

Everything about it was terrible - the production, the budget, the acting, the storyline (yes they have to kill each other for the show but why? what happens if they don't? did they enlist for the show? um why???? do they just keep killing until they are killed?), the character development (what was with the crazy old guy??) and finally the music (if you could call it that).
