8108342,5,B000EC3R6I,"I saw this movie in the theaters when it came out.  I never laughed so hard in my life.  I have remembered it for close to 40 years, and through the wonders of technology, it is available again.  I just bought a copy, and it looks like it was the scan of a copy of the film, complete with occaisional dust spots.  But that just adds to the ambience.  The budget special effects are what are the most memorable.",1314144000,3,410,4.139240506329114
