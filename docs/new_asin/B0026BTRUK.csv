3853330,5,B0026BTRUK,"I'm a painter who uses color to awash a canvas and then let my imagination take me into the mysteries of color.  It was so very interesting to me to view this excellent video on the detailed engineering used by the masters of figurative painting to make sure every  placement of design and color were ""engineered"" to reflect the absolute to the human eye. Every trained artist will have studied this....but every untrained artist at heart will appreciate this film immensely.",1365292800,2,475,4.851851851851852
3853331,5,B0026BTRUK,"One of the best about painting light. Would highly recommend it for all serious painters, or beginners to understand about light.",1364428800,4,129,5.190476190476191
3853332,5,B0026BTRUK,Wonderland for artists!  Techniques by a genius made us spellbound for the entire film...not for people looking for a movie or a storyline.,1356739200,,139,5.043478260869565
3853333,5,B0026BTRUK,"This DVD appears to be a retrospective on the Vermeer exhibition of the same name, IIRC, that was held years ago at the National Gallery in Washington DC [USA]. That exhibition sold out, for good reason. What an incredible artist!",1356307200,,230,4.775
3853334,5,B0026BTRUK,"If you love art and live Vermeer, this is a must to have and view over and over again, along with the movie ""Girl with a Pearl Earring""",1355616000,,135,3.857142857142857
3853335,5,B0026BTRUK,"I enjoyed this DVD on Vermeer very much. I have seen other Documentaries on his work, and found this one to be one of my favorites. I would recommend it to artists and non artists. It is a calm relaxing film to watch with Meryl Streep as the narrator. She speaks clearly and slow to hear and understand the narration of the works by Vermeer. Quality of the film is very good also.",1313452800,10,380,4.219178082191781
3853336,5,B0026BTRUK,"A good mix of experts with lots of superb graphics.  Computer 3D wire simulations.  Analysis of original lines and removal of touch-ups that were added over the centuries to ""improve"" the paintings.  A gem of a DVD.  Lets have more of these for other artists.",1282262400,20,259,4.688888888888889
3853337,5,B0026BTRUK,"This documentary is tied together nicely with perfect narrator tone, extraordinary paintings and lovely, fitting music. I knew I would be mesmerized by the images on the screen, and the story engages like no other.  It was an interesting piece to learn more about Vermeer's paintings and his technique.",1260835200,22,302,5.163265306122449
3853338,5,B0026BTRUK,"After the recent Metropolitan Museum exhibit featuring Vermeer's Milkmaid, I got interested in reading more about the artists.  My librarian suggested this video and I liked it so much I decided to purchase a copy for my personal library.  The analyses of composition and the graphics they've created to describe Vermeers painting techniques are really great . . . and, unlike some art historians, those interviewed here don't go off the deep end in their interpretations.",1258675200,45,472,5.197368421052632
3853339,5,B0026BTRUK,"... hence will not include information regarding the camera obscura.

This film is a recent DVD release which I haven't yet seen. I'll view it with interest and may update this review.",1247097600,3,184,4.75

3853342,5,B0026BTRUK,What a treat.  I was delighted with the purchase.  I love things like this.  They enrich our lives. Thank you.,1392508800,,110,4.4
3853343,5,B0026BTRUK,"Vermeer: Master of Light is a must see for any aspiring, or professional, artist!  Very well done production, beautiful paintings, excellent information concerning the importance of light in our paintings!",1389139200,,205,5.833333333333333
3853344,5,B0026BTRUK,"There is not much biographical information, because not much is available, but the paintings are fabulous.  The paintings are analyzed as to their composition and color.  Very interesting information--I have not seen this done before.",1386547200,3,234,5.6571428571428575
3853345,5,B0026BTRUK,Very well done and brings attention to the artist's fine talents.  Beginning is a little slow but visually lovely.  Arrived in a timely manner and well packaged.  Thank you.,1383004800,,173,4.896551724137931
3853346,5,B0026BTRUK,Very nice and very professional.  They stay away from uneccesary speculation about Vermeer's private life and stick to his art.  Well done.,1381795200,,139,5.2727272727272725
3853347,5,B0026BTRUK,"We watched this before taking a trip to Amsterdam and it definitely enhanced our appreciation of the original paintings.  It is a wonderful, thorough, easily understandable treatment of an interesting subject.  Not a movie thriller, but enjoyable to watch if you are motivated to learn.",1380672000,,286,5.333333333333333
3853348,5,B0026BTRUK,It is amazing we know so little about this artist.  The film captures the true workings of one of the greatest artists of any time.,1371340800,,131,4.24
3853349,5,B0026BTRUK,"I happen to love Vermeer's work...contrasts of light and everyday subjects. To get a flavor of life in his time
the movie Girl with a Pearl Earring is wonderful...done in the same tones as his work. This DVD narrated by Meryl
Streep is a great study of his works and she is joined by Art Historians who use modern techniques to explain
how he painted and how precise Vermeer was in color, composition, and most importantly, his use of LIGHT.

Little is actually known of Vermeer..he left no letters etc,,,just his magnificent works of art, numbering 35 in all.
There is so much mystery about his life, in fact, much is surmised from Dutch history and the culture of the
time, but nothing directly of his thoughts, feelings, motivations. What is known and accepted in the art world is that
 he was a great Master artist and his use of light consistent and unique. I so liked the explanations of how scientific he was
in focus and use of color. His subjects were household members mostly, and are a visual comment of the times, mores,
dress, and attitudes of the Dutch in the 1600's . He died at 43, was beholden to benefactors, and had many children.
It seemed he was at home where he worked most of the time. Interesting so little is known of him.

I would love to see more of these sorts of documentaries done by art experts about the Impressionists as well and
great Masters..art history classes on dvd would be wonderful. I am lucky to live near the Smithsonian, one of America's
treasures, as well as the Corcoran Gallery of  Art. If you find Vermeer's work interesting you will want to own this DVD
and learn how incredibly talented he really was. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",1365379200,8,1670,4.556666666666667
8352467,5,B0026BTRUK,Without a doubt the best video on art I have ever seen.,1500595200,,55,3.6666666666666665
8352468,5,B0026BTRUK,A memorable experience as Director of Photography. Shot in Delft Netherlands and in the USA. Years later Meryl Streep personally complimented me on my Cinematography which made my day.,1489449600,,184,5.379310344827586
8352469,4,B0026BTRUK,"This is a replacement DVD I had for years and have lost. I show this movie to my Art2 students. It didn't work for Art 1 because it is a slow movie with a lot to look at and listen to, but Art 2 loved it. The movie talks about both, the artists' life and the way he worked, and normally shorter and faster movies focus on one of these aspects and I get complaints from the kids who wanted to learn more about either the artists or the paintings. After this movie my students said that Vermeer has become their favorite artist now, and I think it is because they really understand how to look at his art after watching it. We draw glass when I show this movie and students really get it when I tell them to look at the light and reflections when drawing glass, it makes sense now.
The only reason why I give it 4 stars is because it is not HD. When I first bought it and had an older projector, it was OK, but now I have HD projector and it really show the resolution is low and the images are not sharp enough.",1482278400,,1010,4.0049504950495045
8352470,5,B0026BTRUK,"Great documentary See it after watching ""Tim's Vermeer"".",1476144000,,56,6.125
8352471,1,B0026BTRUK,"This 1-star review is for the price - NOT for the movie.  $128.99 for a DVD?  How is this possible for a movie featuring Meryl Streep (!), as narrator, to be so rare that supply & demand dictates it can be offered for sale at such a price?  Absolutely disgusting.

I'm sure this is a very fine movie, indeed, but I shall never know... not at $129.",1452556800,,347,4.134328358208955
8352472,5,B0026BTRUK,"fascinating and great documentary on Vermeer.  Highly recommend this video, narrated by Meryl Streep.",1436227200,,101,6.214285714285714
8352473,3,B0026BTRUK,"This is more an instruction for the art student though does give perspective with opinions of how Vermeer tackled object placement. Lots of filler. Meryl Streep did very little  narration.

I absolutely love Vermeer and P D Hooch but would recommend Girl With A Pearl Earring for the cinematography (not the acting) as you get a truer feeling for the emotion of what the artist was working with for light and setting. Would not spend that amount had I known.",1413331200,,458,4.7125
8352474,5,B0026BTRUK,Meryl Streep's contribution certainly enhances a wonderful DVD on one of my favorite artists who is truly a Master of Light.  I viewed for personal enjoyment and showed in class.,1402185600,,178,4.933333333333334
8352475,4,B0026BTRUK,"This video is a uniquely excellent study of art.  The quality of the video is good and the narration is perfect.  The historians who talk about the pictures do a brilliant job describing the construction of the images and these discussions are supplemented by superb animations that show the construction of perspective, color and shadows.

However, there are two weaknesses here.  First the minor gripe, the historians clearly love Vermeer and when they are not talking about the technical aspects of his painting they do gush a bit.  A more serious weakness is the amount of material covered and the length of the video.  The video only shows about a dozen of his paintings and more than 10 percent of the video is environment/nature shots and credits. So, what is covered is as good at it gets but I feel a bit shortchanged....",1401235200,3,830,4.769230769230769
8352476,5,B0026BTRUK,An unlocked door. Beautiful message and wonderfully narrated. This is gigantic. Could start a modern day revolution in art reproduction.,1395360000,,136,5.85
