8527004,5,B008DGY9VE,"Highly recommended for Christians and unbelievers.  The opening part of the series interviews people with different beliefs. Primarily focusing on New Age/Spirituality interviews. This helps to disarm the unbelieving viewer who assumes they will get bible thumped from the get go.  It actually engages the viewer and makes their beliefs appear to be at least acceptable and tolerant.  The film then very systematically outlines the dynamics of ""truth"" itself and proceeds to show the viewer the need for absolute truth and how the Bible alone has proved itself by several criteria  to be the reliable, genuine source of universal truth in spite of man and histories attempt to discredit , undermine, twist, add to and ultimately put away scripture.  In order to be a New Ager, one has to discount evidence and truth itself to accommodate the Hindu concept that there is no absolute truth.  The film is careful not to intimidate the viewer that is engaged in false beliefs.  But on the other hand, it is bold enough to confront the false religions in a rational, truthful and believable manner.  The presentation ultimately concludes with a clear, cohesive presentation of God's plan of man's salvation through faith in the shed blood of Jesus Christ on the cross.  This DVD will help you cut through much of the heady, illogical spin that new agers habitually  resort to as objections when they are presented with God's ultimate truths.",1408492800,4,1436,5.0210970464135025
8527005,4,B008DGY9VE,"I was favorably impressed with the material covered in this DVD. You also get plenty of hours of material. I might have given this 5 stars had I not already been familiar with much of the material covered. Not everyone has spent as many hours reading and watching material and personally witnessing the deception creeping into the church as I have. This set of DVDs covers a wide range of deceptions all Christians should become aware of in the times in which we live. God's word has numerous warnings for a very good reason. I can recommend this DVD set to those desiring to know more about the tactics Satan is using to mislead many. Also to those concerned about the statement in scripture in Matthew 24:24. One can't be too careful in the times in which we are living. This set of DVDs would best be viewed over several days rather than in one extended viewing as there is a lot to digest in it. It would also be suitable as a once a week, two month or longer study. Each section varies in length and one section in itself may need to be broken up into pieces as the sections vary from about a half hour to over an hour each. The total running time of the set is in the vicinity of eight hours I believe. The first part of the set is a well presented case for salvation based upon sound (conventional) doctrine and then the set moves into deception. There are numerous candid interviews with ""people on the street"" which gives great insight into what the general population believes. The bright spot in this is a few of those people seem to have beliefs based upon what one might call ""sound conventional doctrine"". but there is also a wide variety of beliefs not even beginning to align with scripture that surface from many of those interviewed. These interviews make this DVD set somewhat unique and interesting.",1390953600,2,1819,4.498489425981873
8527006,5,B008DGY9VE,"A much needed supplement for every Christian to view and also anyone in the NAM who is looking for Truth! Deception exposed to the core! After watching, you won't need to helplessly be in the dark anymore! A thumbs up to the work that went into this extensive study!",1358294400,4,266,4.448979591836735
8527007,5,B008DGY9VE,"Found this to be an invaluable resource and very well put together.  Very thought provoking and eye opening
and extemely well researched. 8 hours of research and interviews but broken down in short and  to digest sections",1347667200,4,221,4.945945945945946
8527008,5,B008DGY9VE,"This series really does a great job of ""laying out"" the options for spiritual life decisions. Multiple views are presented, with much new information, and helpful comparisons are made. I would give this DVD to anyone who is wondering just what difference there is in spiritual paths, ultimately. It would present a great format for discussion in a small group or study. Some images are disturbing to children. My nine-year-old wanted to watch with me, and she was deeply saddened by some of the spiritual blindness she saw for the first time.",1345507200,6,542,4.9021739130434785
