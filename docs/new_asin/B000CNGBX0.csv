Being a horror film connoiseur with a library of thousands of films, I'm impressed - so much so I can't recall a film that resembles SUGAR.  It holds its own.  Creepy, terrifying, chilling, disturbing, and horrific best describe its temper.  Viewers may find themselves taking on the emotional charge of the main character played by Samara Golden.  This is so well done, you'll find yourself taking on her eery personna...her fear...her frustrations...and I loved the scene when the power was going out (no spoilers here).  Give this one a chance.  It has become a permanent addition to my horror library.  Great job!",1228521600,2,760,5.1138211382113825
8099687,4,B000CNGBX0,"Sugar takes risks and is smarter than so many other such indie projects that boast that they have something to offer. Horror fans, serious filmmakers and those who really like a challenge should take a look. Stylish and interesting, the gothic idea hits its mark as Golden convincingly incarnates a woman who is some steps past the verge of a nervous breakdown. The absence of dialogue and linear narrative adds to the nightmarish qualities of the work which most viewers should find refreshing.  Imaginative and unsettling, Sugar packs the punch!",1140652800,3,547,5.0777777777777775
8099688,4,B000CNGBX0,"Eerie, spooky, scary, and truly disturbing, Sugar is anything BUT your traditional narrative, rather a demented series of images structured to tell a story, and one that will haunt you.  From color to black and white, the cinematography closes in on its subject very effectively, and although there is little dialogue, the pic more than holds its own.

Samara Golden is very good in the movie, giving an intensely intimate performance.  She doesn't shy away from the material at all and does an admirable job of delivering a fine turn while dealing with some very difficult and unnerving scenes. She's naked for portions of the film, though it hardly feels exploitative or like its there to titillate, rather it seems like the nudity is presented to us to matter-of-factly so that we're able to see how vulnerable her character is during these moments.

If it all sounds rather pretentious, it isn't.  Matter of fact, it works. The obvious comparisons to some of David Lynch's work is hard not to make, Eraserhead in particular, and at times the visuals are reminiscent of some of David Fincher's work reminding us of the gritty, filthy sets used for the murder set pieces in Seven and the moldy prison compound used in Alien 3.  It's not often that a film can tell us as little as Sugar does but still make us think, make us strive to come up with our own interpretation of the events that have just unfolded before our eyes. But that's exactly what it does.

Also worth noting is that the one and only J. G. Thirwell contributed the musical score to the film. Those who have enjoyed his work in the various projects that he's been involved in, from Foetus to bizarre projects like Baby Zizanie (where he collaborated with Jim Coleman) will probably find much to appreciate about the work he's created for this movie. Not only does it fit into his discography quite nicely but it also really works well against the nightmarish and surreal background that the film slaps us around with. The filmmakers give us enough to work with so that even if things aren't spoon-fed to us we're able to at least follow the film. As for story, the strong revenge motif playing throughout more than aptly holds our attention, ultimately for the viewer resulting in an exercise in interpretation. Whether fans of the genre or aficionados of the film art, Sugar deserves a look.",1140652800,6,2361,4.7299270072992705
8099689,1,B000CNGBX0,"Simply put. Don't buy. It has ""NO"" storyline. You can't guess what's going on, because she says nothing, through out the entire movie, to include answering the phone. The ""only"" other character in the movie is a dead girl. It bounces from black & white scences to color. Their's no noise. It's a silent movie for you to draw any kind of conclusion. If you have a ememy, send them a copy.",1140393600,2,387,4.388888888888889
