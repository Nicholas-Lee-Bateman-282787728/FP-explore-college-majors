7824114,4,6302290562,"Waldron, Charley Rouse, Woody Shaw. Reggie Workman, and Ed Blackwell play extended versions of three Waldron tunes, plus the pianist is seen playing a solo version of his classic ""Left Alone"" at another venue.  The performances, video and audio are all excellent.  However, the production gets a little too artsy during many of the solos, occasionally shifting to still shots or even slow motion, which tends to be distracting and frustrating.  A minor quibble--recommended otherwise.",1328054400,3,484,5.426666666666667

The group also produced 2 CDs from this gig, The Git-Go and The Seagulls of Kristiansud under Mal Waldrons' name.
