2798242,5,B000OPO61U,"Important film to instruct a new generation about the truth behind the revolution in Cuba.  The new push to romanticize Che and Fidel makes this a timely message.  Thank you, Andy Garcia, for your commitment to making the story known to a popular audience.  The music is great, the actress is beautiful, the filmmaking excellent, but the real message for me was the chilling reminder that freedom is not free, and we in the U.S. are the beneficiaries of a very unique legacy only very rarely emulated.  See this plus Andy's prior film, ""For Love or Country"" re: the defection of Arturo Sandoval.",1151193600,22,595,4.747572815533981
2798243,4,B000OPO61U,"The movie is a strange mix of Casablanca, The Godfather, and any number of Hollywood musicals from the 40's and 50's. This makes sense given that the writer, Guillermo Cabrera Infante (maybe Cuba's greatest writer) was a huge fan of and liked to write about American movies and Cuban music. His stories are a blend of comedy and sex and violence and almost always about Havana, and he loved to use word-play and puns. Supposedly, he is represented in the movie by the Bill Murray character, which sometimes seems jarring and out of place unless you are familiar with Cabrera Infante - I think he would have loved it. Personally, I like that the movie shows that the Castro revolution was not a ""peasant revolution"" (as people in the U.S., including some movie critics, seem to believe) but was actually driven and financed by the upper class. I like that it shows Batista's regime in almost as bad a light as Castro's. And I like that it shows Ch Guevara not as some romantic hero but as a ruthless killer for whom ""the end justifies the means."" And, most of all, the vintage Cuban music by artists like Beny Mor and Bola de Nieve is simply wonderful and wonderfully used throughout the film.

The movie might be about 20 minutes too long and in some scenes the characters tend to talk too much in slogans rather than natural speech. But Garca wanted to be faithful to Cabrera Infante's script because, as he says, ""you don't rewrite Hemingway."" (Actually, this is not true: William Faulkner changed much of Hemingway's To Have and Have Not when he adapted it for the movie, and it's a great movie - better than the book.) But anyway, what the hell... Thumbs up for The Lost City! (Ebert and Roper agree!)",1150848000,16,1705,4.590163934426229
2798244,4,B000OPO61U,"This movie was well made, well directed, and very thoughtful.  However, the length of the movie was nearly 3 hours, which is simply too long.  Ines Sastre, who plays Aurora, was my favorite in the movie.  She gave the best performance out of everyone. As always, Bill Murray and Dustin Hoffman gave enjoyable performances. I would suggest renting the movie and fast forwarding through the slow parts.",1150329600,6,400,4.940298507462686

2798252,5,B000OPO61U,"A heartbraking yet inspiring film with superb roles acted by Andy Garcia, Bill Murray and others. Beautifully shot and with an incomparable accompanying soundtrack, this movie resonated deeply with me, the child of a Cuban refugee. Based on Cabrera Infante's novel ""Tres Tristes Tigres"", it is a blend of historic and surreal moments that center on how the Revolution splintered the very core of the quintessential Cuban family. ""Havana has its petals and has its thorns, how you perceive it depends on how you grab it...but in the end, it always grabs you...""",1485129600,,560,5.032258064516129

2798271,2,B000OPO61U,"The story of the movie was so topical ( Cuba before and after Castro) that I felt compelled to watch.  What a mistake.  This film was poorly focused ( was it about music, politics, the mafia, a love story, the importance of family...the revolution, the migrations?)  all were mildly touched upon in this 2 1/2 hour painfully long movie.  All the more disappointing because, with some better writing and serious editing, it could have been a movie worth watching",1451779200,,461,4.7974683544303796
2798272,1,B000OPO61U,"I ejected 'The Lost City' after about fifteen minutes; it will be on the shelf for a few years, then thrown away.

The movie is just one more in an endless list of mumblies, with loud music and background noise / ""sound effects"" drowning out much of the dialogue.

It doesn't have English subtitles for the spoken dialogue. It only has subtitles for Spanish dialogue and English subtitles for the Spanish language music. Therefore, the viewer gets the pleasure of reading translated music lyrics while futilely attempting to understand what the actors are saying.

I've only ever seen Andy Garcia in 'Godfather 3;' he wasn't convincing in either that movie or 'Lost City.' Garcia seems to have only one facial expression: ""I'm cool, man, I'm cool. I see all, know all, I'm in charge."" The chin doesn't help.",1449100800,,807,4.833333333333333
2798273,5,B000OPO61U,"This film moved me to tears.  I can relate to the protagonist's dilemma, being obliged to move away from a place he loved because it was destroyed by socialists/communists.  They start out talking about freedom.  They leave spelling, punctuation, and grammar by the wayside when they take over the universities and the media.  (Sound like education and the press in the U.S.A. today?)  Then they won't let you have a saxophone in your band.  Then they close down your nightclub altogether.  Before you know it, they've beaten one of your best friends to death.  Then they show up on the tobacco farm you built and maintained your entire life with your own hands, and evict you in the name of freedom.  Finally, you find yourself handing over all your cash and heirlooms to the cause of freedom at the airport, as you thank God and all your lucky stars that the S.O.B.'s are at least honoring your exit visa, as you flee to the U.S.A. to start over from scratch, washing dishes and mopping the floors of someone else's nightclub since Fidel and Che confiscated yours.

But wait, now you can't build a swimming pool or have a green lawn in California, and the taxes on your property are going up faster than the Cost of Living Allowances on your pension.

Fidel Castro and Che Guevara truly were pieces of self-serving excrement, and this film shows it better than any I've seen.",1448928000,,1377,4.648760330578512
2798274,3,B000OPO61U,"This is a cinematically beautiful film, apparently based on an historical novel, which wove real people (e.g., Myer Lansky, Che Guevera) into its story line.  It deals with 1958/1959 Havana, as Castro came to power.
On the downside, the film does not seem to have been well edited: overly long in some scenes and disjointed in others (e.g., There is a brief voodoo scene, quite unrelated to the story.).  I was also surprised that the film did not explore the role of Catholicism in the multi-generational family it features (By the way, this film is reviewed on the web site of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.).",1447286400,,621,4.794392523364486

He tells it from the perspective of those well-to-do Cubans, many of whom emigrated to South Florida. This is a good DVD for folks to watch who know very little about these events. I grew up in South Florida, and watched the news of all these things happening. I find it very true to the actuality of this time and these people.",1442275200,,440,4.313253012048193
2798281,4,B000OPO61U,I like the theme of the movie. The leading actress is horrible. She looks fake and has a Spanish accent not Cuban. Plenty of good Cuban actresses can do a better job.,1442275200,,166,4.21875
2798282,3,B000OPO61U,"This film is a loving paean to the Lost Babylon of Havana from Cuban-American actor Andy Garcia and Cuban writer Guillermo Cabrera Infante.  As such it is a beautifully-photographed recreation of a time and place with micro-attention to the smallest period details.  It is a joy to watch; but its substance is a one-dimensional contrast to its lavish production values.  Though it tries to interpret revolutionary Havana for the US filmgoer, it remains a film by Cuban exiles for that community.  As such it well reflects the blinkered, politically correct upper-class worldview of its primary audience.

While it touches on obscure fun facts about the ""revolutionary process"" of the 1950s - like the publicity kidnapping of Argentine car racer Fangio - it is surprisingly erroneous on many historic points.  Set in 1958, it portrays the Revolutionary Directorate's attack on Batista's presidential palace in exquisite detail - though this occurred in March, 1957.  There is a reference to the 1948 Constitution, which must mean the one of 1940: a glaring gaffe if coming from scriptwriter Cabrera Infante.  The impassioned lecture delivered by Don Federico to the Cuban Congress would have been made in an empty building: this had been closed by Batista and replaced by a puppet Council of State.

Its critical view of Che Guevara is an ideological counterpoint to post-revolutionary hagiography, and just as misleading.  While it captures his sardonic humor well enough, the film's portrayal confuses the official executioner of the Revolutionary Tribunal at La Cabana with the guerrilla.  The depiction of Che's cold-blooded killing a wounded Batista soldier in the field would be completely contrary to July 26 Movement policy and for which there is no evidence.  (Dealing with chivatos - informers - would have been another matter.)  No doubt the related denouement of  guerrilla-in-power Ricardo, blowing his brains out in remorse, is a Miami wet dream for the island's post-Castro future.

The timeline after Jan. 1, '59, gets rather confused.  There was no Soviet ambassador until May, 1960, so Fico's exile must have occurred later that year.  The scene of his departure among other exiles-in-making was unrealistic: I can't imagine such a somber, downbeat, deadpan leavetaking from any quayload of Cubans. His remaining aloof from Meyer Lansky while in Batista's Cuba was similarly unconvincing.  The film does accurately depict how the Revolution divided Cuban society even at the most elite levels. But it conveniently ignores the main reason for Fidel's mass support among the majority: precisely because the oligarchic likes of the Familia Fellove despised him.  When Don Federico states that Cuba survived because of its ""unity,"" he apparently does not know his own country's history!

Most of the deleted scenes in the DVD edition should have been retained, especially the classic apocryphal joke of how Che was appointed to the State Bank (""economist/communist"").  While technically an excellent, colorful film, its POV is too black-and-white and full of errors.  As such it can be recommended only as a portrayal of that opinion.",1442188800,,3147,5.30241935483871

He wrote the screen play, directed, wrote the music, stars in, and produced this film about the months leading up to and following the revolution in Cuba and the start of the Fidel Castro years. It is an interesting account of the divisiveness suffered by a wealthy Cuban family (and Cuba) and its fate during and after the revolution. Great cinematography, but the camera seems to linger to long on Garcia in some of the scenes.

2798307,3,B000OPO61U,"In Lost City, we are presented with a Cuban nation that is increasingly growing displeased with their President Fulgencio Batista and the current Cuban government. Many Cubans are ready for a chance, but there is much disagreement over how this change should be implemented and who should lead it. Even those who want a more democratic approach, like Fico's father, acknowledge that it is time for a ""Christ with a whip"" to come to Cuba.
 Besides the democratic approach of Ficos father, his sons opt for a more revolutionary approach, with Ricardo joining forces with Fidel Castro and becoming an important officer within the new Communist government. While the movie presented an interesting character arc for all of Ficos children and was entertaining, some of its depictions of the reality of Communism were less effective than others.
 The revolutions themselves were historically just to what Communist revolutions look like, namely, in necessitating large amounts of violence and bloodshed and the necessity of being led by a leader that is not afraid of being brutal and violent. This was explained nicely in a scene with Che when he gives a short speech to Ricardo, who seems to feel some remorse for the people they just killed, and Che tells him that there is nothing to be upset over. The revolution requires violence for a free Cuba, and that the end justifies the means. For Communists like Che, violence is not done for the sake of violence, but out of necessity to lead a successful revolution.
 Where I felt the movie failed in its portrayal of Communism lay with the characters presented to us. In most Communist revolutions, and in its purest form as Marx imagined it, the Communist Revolutions would represent the overthrowing of the bourgeoisies, or the upper class of rich people. This revolution to overthrow them would be led by peasants and the working class who were being exploited by the upper class, particularly in industrialized countries. Marx, in fact, felt that such a revolution could not occur in countries like Russia and Cuba because of their lack of industry. In this movie, the Cubans whose eyes we see the revolution through are fairly well off nightclub owners. They may not be part of the upper echelon of Cuban society, but they are far from the peasants that Marx imagined the revolution to be led by. In fact, peasants are largely absent from the movie, with the exception of Ricardo who seems to take on the faade of a peasant or lower class Cuban when he joins forces with Che and Castro.
  Overall, I enjoyed the movie and felt it told a compelling story of how this period in Cuban history affected individuals and families, even forcing some to flee as Fico was, but that it would have been more effective to see the revolution through the eyes of Cubas most oppressed. We get short glimpses of it when we are presented with scenes like Luiss failed assault on the Presidential Palace, but none make a strong impression of the roots of the communist revolution in Cuba.",1436054400,2,3020,4.822393822393822

This shows how easily people are sucked into a mass sense of security thinking they will emerge as a republic with democracy through rebellion, then communism takes over and eventually sucks the creativity and life out of people.

2798318,1,B000OPO61U,"A poorly made film in that the music and settings can't make up for the blatant propaganda. It portrays the pre-revolutionary Cuba as one long party for the rich and powerful. The poor are either not seen, or shown dancing happily. The revolutionaries are characters out of a US 50's anti-communist army film. The film is Garcia's regret for the lovely city and life style lost when the dictatorship and mafia were overthrown. Garcia seems to be saying if only the wealthy class had been a little more honest, they might have kept their money and property. It's only value is that it shows you the shallow, detached from reality, self-centered view that the right wing Cubans have of the revolution.",1430006400,2,699,4.785123966942149

2798361,5,B000OPO61U,"Let me preface my estimate of the film acknowledging the initial and comtinuing large scale health care and educational efforts of the Revolution. I remember it well. It was the first step into Paradise, the only issue among early 60's radicals was whether Trotsky or Lenin would carry the torch. We found out very quickly who it would be, well, sort of, if we only had listened to ourselves, I remember the specific interchange between a party and populist student socialist: ""Castro has banned all opposition press."" ""Haven't you read that this was necessary. It was a question of the allocation of limited paper supplies."" And I kid you not, the defender went on to argue that toilet paper was a more pressing need! And since then much toilet paper has been wiping up after Fidel.

Again, to be fair, there has been changes in policy and direction, what is termed ""Fidel's pragmatic understanding of concrete revolutionary factors,"" like sending Che to South America and more recently allowing non-party members to have limited cellphone access (maybe to call Costco for more toilet paper) have and are taking place. A ""new generation"" of leaders are already in place as Fidel and Raul have moved to the refurbished outskirts of Havana.

But what of Hidden City by Andy Garcia?

While many people shun the film as conservative propaganda--some with sincere feelings that the Revolution overcame terror and exploitation, most committed leftists do so because of the portrayal of especially Che and the Party post-revolutionary tactics and ""vision"" for a New Cuba. Well, having been to and going again to Cuba/Havana, the note
the film ends on unfortunately is more than accurate. Only a lengthy searching visit, really, visits--and not to one of those ""sanctioned"" cultural tours--can reveal what one mental Heath professional described as a society that knocks you off your feet and ""turns you into beast.""

When I spoke with varied groups and individuals--of course in anxious secrecy, about the limitations and possibilities of life in the States, there was a repeated open-mouthed stare followed by--as one professional-turned-construction-worker-turned-hotel-service-employee put it, ""You don't understand how what you describe as ""freedom"" in the States doesn't register with us. It's like an extra-terrestrial describing another galaxy!"" And, quickly during my first trip to Havana, I found out the concrete reality that prevented his understanding, the CDR ""offices"" that doted every neighborhood.

In one stopping at a three table cafe, someone cautiously slipped from the Committee for the Defense of the Revolution storefront and sat next to us. Blinking eyes and a grimaced look fom my friend cautioned me to be careful in what I said and asked. Later, as we walked through the park near a perpetually netted being-refurbished public building. I expressed my disbelief in what had occurred. ""I just thought it was someone who wanted to get in on a conversation with a foreigner."" Pointing to a group of maybe twenty or so men gathered around a park bench in heated animation, my friend asked. ""What do you think they are arguing about?"" ""Their families, children, women?"" ""No,"" ""Politics?"" ""Oh, no, never."" ""What then?"" ""Baseball. Every day at the same bench, it's baseball. Our public discourse, about what we may have an opinion or feelings about is one-dimensional with heavy lines. That is why the description of even a two-dimensional society confounds us. We are permitted width, not depth, and certainly never altitude... Except with close friends and carefully guarded. You don't even speak in front of children about certain subjects because they might innocently repeat to the wrong person or in the wrong place.""

It was at that point that I felt like an extra-terrestrial who had landed on Flatland. When, in the film, Andy Garcia's nightclub owner character is told that his orchestra can no longer have a saxophone because the saxophone was developed by a Belgian and the Belgians are surpressing  Lamumba's Congalese revolutionary struggle, I understood how a one-dimensional political society had developed and defined a person's self-identity. My friend brought the weight of such restrictions home to me when said, ""You don't understand. I and most Cubans were born into this. There is no ' outside', nothing before 1959 exists. Look around you. All you see are '59 Chevys and a few Russian compacts left behind.""

So, the film, is it accurate? Obviously I think so from what I have directly seen, heard and remember about what happened to our enthusiasms for a fourth dimension of political possibilities. But what rings most true about the film is to me captured in its final moments when Andy Garcia's character literally dances up a staircase to Cuban rhythms (with a saxophone contributing). Why? Because the Cuban people that I've come to know on a truly personal level live in and must publically comport themselves to Party doggerel and two note cadences, but even with CDR scrutiny, their ""music"" erupts everywhere and you can't help clapping time and breaking into a Mambo move. And when Andy Garcia's character stops his dancing ascent and turns to give a clave head nod and smile before continuing on, you understand that the Cuban soul and future is as powerful and pure as ever, 1-2-3..1-2, waiting for the right partner to ask for the next dance, hopefully when the old bandmaster goes to the paradise he deserves.",1415836800,2,5461,5.107502799552072

It centers around an aristocratic Cuban family and the chaos that unfolds within that family during the Castro revolution.

The acting in this movie is fine, except Bill Murray. This is one of those movies in which the acting is secondary to the story. Granted, the unnamed Bill Murray character is one of the worse I have seen. I suppose his scenes were meant to be comic relief, but they come off as an awkward and annoying blemish on an otherwise scenic and poignant film. How this escaped editing is a mystery to me. I kept waiting for the hidden purpose of Bill Murray's character to be revealed, but it never was.

This was a personal project of Andy Garcia and the story of his long term involvement is inspiring. I certainly came away with a different and more understanding view regarding Cuban exiles.

The movie is beautifully photographed, the story compelling, the women are stunning, the music is to die for and one feels a great deal of sympathy for and empathy with Andy Garcia's pivotal character .......but, sadly, overall, the acting is without passion, stilted, pedestrian work at best.

That being said, should you buy it? Yes.

Rather, it shows some of the gun shootings - not gory.  Typically, I send out a permission slip for my 13/14 yr old students to have parents sign just in case. The movie has become a hit with this age group and it clearly allows students to understand the issues families dealt with before, during, and after the revolution.

A wealthy Cuban family is divided by politics and passions in the late 1950s, during the transition from the Batista government to the Castro regime, and they are decimated by same.

2798455,5,B000OPO61U,"Andy Garcia's vision of life in Havana and the conflict that created the divisions in Cubans is captured in this fascinating film. Set in Havana, Cuba starting in the 1950's, a wealthy family with three sons is caught in the violent transition from the soft dictatorship of Batista that overthrew 50 years of the republic to the Stalinist police state of Fidel Castro that replaced it. Although produced here in the US by Cuban American Andy Garcia, ""Lost City"" is also a good movie about the Cuban Revolution from as seen from the eyes of fictional character Fico Fellove (played by Andy Garca), Fico is the owner of El Tropico, a nightclub in late 1950s Havana. He lives for his family and his music. Brother Ricardo becomes a Communist under Che while brother Luis joins the pro-democracy opposition of the Revolutionary Directorate- which one of my uncles joined back in the 50's. Fico's father Federico, a university professor, believes that Batista should be replaced by constitutional means- similar to former Cuban House Speaker Marquez Sterling. The film makes no bones about the need to remove dictator Fulgencio Batista, but also unequivocally shows that what happened next was far worse for all involved under the thumb of the Castro brothers and their sadistic lackey Cha Guevara. Fico leaves Cuba and starts all over by working as a dishwasher and piano player at a Cuban club, hoping to save enough money to bring the remaining members of his family to America. The emotional energy of the interaction of the characters, with the Revolution as a backdrop, carries the film- including the surviving brother's steamy romance with the widow of the brother that died early in the struggle. The outstanding photography, excellent acting, great music and clever storytelling all come together to form a superb film. This is a film about the history of the origins of modern Cuba, from Batista to the current Castro regime, and the Refugee experience. It reminds me of the experience of my own working class family, where a couple of my kin fought on the side of the Revolution, only to find themselves in jail about a years after Fidel Castro cancelled elections and freedom of expression by mid-1960.",1336867200,,2210,4.943548387096774

2798459,3,B000OPO61U,"I came to this movie late, and frankly, was anticipating more historical enlightenment from it.  Living through that era, but at a distance, we were surrounded by propaganda from all sides, and the cynical soul sought out his own information.  All that wealth and investment created a glamorous Cuba, no doubt about it, and one that deserves to be preserved for posterity, and even culture's sake.  But the tyranny of such a top-heavy structure was bound to polarize the population, and revolution was inevitable.  As we know now, countries at that level of development rarely spring fully formed into utopian democracy.  Rather, it's common to exchange plutocratic dictators for those of a different sort.  People oppressed for generations take time to open up and embrace civic awareness.  To many, a proletarian dictatorship was undoubtedly preferable.

I wanted to see some footage, or recreation of such, of how that all happened.  Instead, The Lost City is an attractive and stylish work, with overtones of a musical.  And is the music fabulous!  If your toes don't tap to this one, you ain't got no rhythm.  Beautifully shot, the cinematography was excellent, and Garcia's direction in this regard was exceptional.  Other directorial decisions were less fortunate, such as film length and the occasional overglamorization of shots, thus leading to the charge of self-indulgence.  Knowing that Garcia was arranging his own angles is at times cringe-worthy.

The use of Murray and Hoffman has led to some interesting reviewer discussions.  I can see why, but decided to be slightly more tolerant of those decisions.  In the foreign film venue, these digressions are more common and accepted.  They are archtypal symbols and (I think) were meant to give the script more dimensional depth on a personal level.  How does one process the realization that when you leave one troubled community for what you think is a better world, corruption inevitably follows?  It adds tension to the general tone of anticipation of relief in the new setting.  In fact, it leads to a deeper discussion of whether our troubles are fundamentally internal and cannot be cast off like political baggage.  So although I was a bit annoyed at the addition of the Hoffman character at first,  I can also see why it was done.  Murray's trickier . . . this kind of ""Greek drama"" form is surely not going to be universally appreciated by a contemporary audience.  Again, I cut it some slack as an interesting complexity to be considered more fully later.  I do think Garcia meant to use projective personifications to reflect internal personal struggles.

The movie really is too long.  There wasn't quite enough eloquence in the artistic pauses to justify that.

I gave The Lost City 3 stars because the story described a slice of Cuban pre-revolutionary life that was a thin veneer for the real Cuba.  Ordinarily, artistic parsing like that can be excused, but this historical situation was such a big deal, and affected so many people, that the echoes of omission resound in the film's lopsidedness.  It's hard to ignore.  And what another reviewer said was right:  the rebel image was a rough, violent caricature.  There was slight depth in the brother character.  But the rebel energy in general was one-dimensional.  It can only be taken, again, as an external projection for repressed internal anger of the protagonist.  Otherwise, it lacks historical accuracy and fairness.

Still, artistically and musically . . . The Lost City is worth a view.",1318118400,5,3528,5.029360967184801
2798460,5,B000OPO61U,"Yes, it is; and pretty darn good.
I think it took me so(too)long to getting around to watching this flick because I am neither of Cuban heritage, nor an exile.
The movie,a romantic drama, is clearly a labor of love, and a quite fine piece of art.
The Bill Murray character was not necessary; but a sweet tribute to Cabrera Infante. I found the slow pace of the film to be an even more fitting tribute. Infante was exiled from Cuba for 40 years before his death (40 years in a wilderness?). Tres Tristes Tigres was published in 1996. Andy Garcia reportedly worked on the film for 16 years. Apparently, good things can come in a slow package.
The movie is not a documentary. It is an artistic creation. If one is ever lucky enough to see the Mona Lisa, that experience will be unique to the individual viewer. There are millions upon millions of ""takes"" as to what happened in Cuba. I doubt any movie would ever please everybody. I enjoyed the exuberant younger brother who foolishly betrays his family, and ends up a suicide.
I hesitated to give this movie a 5star because I don't think it is a good as Dr. Zhivago or Casablanca. It reminds me more of Brokeback Mountain, in that it is a quite fine movie that Americans were not particularly comfortable embracing. I rented the dvd; but then bought a copy of The Lost City for my permanent collection.
In the early 1960's, my ivy-league educated Republican father use to make it a point to drive us to Miami so we could see the ""Cubans"", which should serve as a warning to us if we ever thought about leaning to the Left. I, myself, sniffed on my last trip that I had never really acquired a taste for Cuban food.
It is only my opinion, but I believe that if Andy Garcia never does another thing, The Lost City establishes him as an artist. It's that good.",1309219200,,1805,4.407185628742515
2798461,5,B000OPO61U,"A labor of love from Andy Garcia.

This movie outlines a history of Cuba up until the takeover by Fidel Castro was an eye opener into the country's history and beautiful music heritage. Shot with breathtaking visuals and some amazingly beautiful musican sequences, I was reminded of another great film ""Buena Vista Social Club"". The facts and historical backdrop of the film are quite true, and Garcia used fictional characters to bring some of this out. I could also see the story-telling style reminded me of Coppola's The Godfather - a film that Andy worked on and was heavily influienced by.

While I have watched this movie several times in the past on DVD, it's best experienced in BluRay high definition because that's when the real beauty and details of sound and visual excellence of this film starts to show. Its a pity such films do not get adequate support of the Hollywood studio system to win Oscar nominations when they are really the most deserving. All in all, a great movie for any serious film affficionado's collection.

The story revolves around his character, a night club owner in 1958 Cuba.  Through his eyes and through the relationships he has with both his family and the woman he loves, we see the events unfold of the revolution and its aftermath.
It's a potentially compelling story, and has been evoked with some stunning set design and memorably vivid recreation of pre-revolution Cuba, but ultimately this story of a family being torn apart by political and ideological differences just lacks momentum and, oddly - drama - to work.  Garcia, who not only stars but co-wrote and directs, seems to want to be the new Godfather - its easy to spot the mannerisms and acting tics, but while he has the beginnings of the flab of a Brando, he lacks the intensity.  There is an interesting subtext to the movie where we see him strive to remain an observer to events, as symbolised by his constantly picking up his Super 8 to capture events important to him - but ultimately he puts down the camera and the events involve him too deeply for him to remain an observer.  Less interesting by far is the appearance of Bill Murray, who appears as The Comedian - a true observer, who comments wryly on proceedings while not being part of them.  It's a device which alas does not add any depth to the narrative but merely drags it out in a way that takes one out of the story rather than illumining it.
Another problem with the movie is that for a film which purports to get under the skin of the revolution and its effects, it signally fails to show any reason for the discontent.  We see a wealthy and happy family in a pristine Havana, and then a brother goes off to join the revolution - why he does is never really explored.  The scenes of violence we do see rather symbolise what is wrong with the movie - we see grenades being thrown, gunshots, explosions - and when the smoke clears, the locations filled with marble and beautiful furnishings remain unscathed.
One factor which might raise the movie by a star to watchable for you, is if you are a fan of Cuban music - authentic and atmospheric music permeates the movie, and the movie seems more like a labor of love for the music, rather than the country, at times.
Being of Cuban descent, Garcia clearly had the energy to craft something special - it's just a shame that his energy failed to weave its way into the resulting film.  What we ultimately have is a movie of loud gunshots and Cuban music in beautiful locations, alternated with mumbled conversations of seemingly great portent, which ultimately lead to - very little of interest.",1245456000,6,2711,4.550308008213553
2798469,5,B000OPO61U,"Many reviewers here seem to want to debate the historical, political or moral accuracy, truth or correctness of The Lost City.

Give it a rest, and appreciate this movie for what it really is.

Hey, revolution happens.  It always has causes and effects.

The Lost City is art.  High art at that.

It appears to me that Garcia did as good a job as humanly possible in balancing his persepctive from the pre-Revolutionary upper and upper middle class with those of the bureaucatic and military ruling class, the working classes, and the revolutionary forces.  This was not a documentary.  It would have been impossible to tell everyone's truth.

Garcia succeeded mightily in crafting a love letter to a place, a time, a history, a culture, and a future, that means much to many, and in doing so helping to illuminate and preserve that culture and awareness for us all.

Garcia's characters in the movie on the political right, center and left display the full spectrum of human conditions, motivations, and emotions, both good and evil, and frequently flawed.

Critics of the movie on either its political or artistic merits are revealing more about themselves, their own agendas, or their appreciation for something other than Hollywood action blockbusters, than about the shortcomings of Garcia or this film.

The Lost City is a story worth telling told well, a beautiful film, full of talented actors and performances, with lush visuals and music.  The setting here is Havana, but it could have taken place anywhere, and this would have been a well made and moving film.  It is therefore timeless and qualifies as classic art.  No complaints.

2798471,3,B000OPO61U,"First of all let me say I am an African-American male who does not speak spanish but for some reason I have developed a fascination with Cuba, the music, politics, history and controversies. I had just read a great book regading the tulmutuous times leading up to the revolution, the book was called ""Havana Nocturne: How the Mob ownwd Cuba and Lost it to the Revolution"". That book dealt with the mafia influence in Cuba and the rampant coruption in Cuba at the time, this movie doesn't mention any of that except for a brief appearance of Meyer Lansky. The book also detailed the nightlife of the times which had much more salacious acts. This movie seemed to show Havana as a squeky clean family city where everyone was happy which by all objective reports it was not. It was a very beautiful film shot in the best parts of the Dominican Republic and the actors  especially the leading lady were also beautiful. However, it historically reminded me of  Gone with the Wind, a  movie about love and family torn apart by the U.S. civil war, the confederacy is seen as a noble group and the north which fought to end slavery  as  unjustified  aggressors and the slaves in the south as happy and content while in fact they were abused and mistreated constantly. Why overthrow that. The Lost City has that feeling. Portraying the revolutionaries very negatively and one-dimensional never honestly dealing with their motivations which would explain why so many joined their cause. This causes you to look at the leading lady who decides to stay as a dimwit not deserving of the leading man yet her eyes and soul give off a strong intelligence which goes against her being a stupid woman being tricked into a cult. In addition, for a country that is supposed to have such a large black population, they are none that speak in this film only sing. Didn't blacks participate in the revolution.

2798480,5,B000OPO61U,"I'm a big fan of the musician Cachao, whom Andy Garcia worked with a lot before Cachao passed away.  Really, Andy was the guy who brought Cachao back from semi-retirement to make what are a couple of masterpieces of Cuban music, See Cachao, Master Sessions Vol. 1 and 2.

I can't say I've ever been a big fan of Andy Garcia though.

That being said, I absolutely loved this movie, everything about it.  I'm not Cuban, I'm a Yankee, about as WASP as they come, and I have little interest in arguing about the Cuban revolution or Fidel Castro or Batista, or anyone else in Cuba for that matter.  Whatever arguments people want to carry on about Cuba and the revolution, have at it.

The funny thing is that I didn't find The Lost City to be a very political movie.  Knowing Andy Garcia and his passion for all things Cuban, I would have expected him to throw in a bunch of anti-communist propaganda.  He didn't (no matter what other reviewers say).  If anything, Andy could have thrown in a lot of ugly scenes depicting all the awful things the communists really did do in Cuba after the revolution.  But he didn't.

To me, this is a movie by a guy who truly loves the country and culture he comes from, and he just wanted to make a movie to express it.  He does so wonderfully.  He depicts Cuba during the revolution through his characters, and doesn't really take any unfair swipes at anybody on any side.

This movie isn't a deep 'masterpiece' by a 'great' film-maker.  Sometimes those kind of movies are terrible movies no matter who wrote, directed or starred in them.  I can remember walking out of an Oscar front runner 'great' movie, laughing with my ex-wife (who graduated with a film degree from USC), about how 'God-awful that movie was.'  I don't need perfect structure.  If you have any experience reading the books of, or watching the movies of, great storytellers, you will have noticed that they make mistakes, try things that don't work, and hit rough patches all the time.  So what.

What I loved most about The Lost City is the way the actors are treated.  Andy Garcia lets everybody, every character, every actor just shine in this movie.  He has an obvious affection not only for Cuba, but for actors and the arts of storytelling and movie making.  His affection jumps off the screen in every scene.

I wish Andy would appear in a few more blockbusters so he can save up some money, make a movie, and tell us another story like this one.",1225324800,4,2456,4.504524886877828

I know that is a complaint, but it bothered me. Garcia sitting at a club table looking ""Bogey"" in a white dinner jacket, the revolution night on New Years Eve, 1959, the chaos as Batista escapes with his loot, it reeked of derivation.

I am sure Cuba, Havana, was a jewel before the revolution, with wonderful Latin music and Cuban dancers with their smooth movement and leg gyrations.  For the wealthy, the weather was perfect, the servants served, the women were beautiful.  I would have dreamed and remembered something as wonderful, but there had been a revolution for a reason.  The brutality of the Batistes led to the brutality of Fidel, the new hero of the people. Socialism destroys the class portrayed by Garcia.  His family disintegrates.

Bill Murray is awful as a foil for the cool Garcia.  His jokes aren't funny.  In old Bogart films as in To Have and to Have Not, there's always a drunk-buddy that provides a few laughs in the face of serious torture or murder.

2798494,4,B000OPO61U,"I remember reading reviews for this film when it was theatrically
released (a very limited release) and for the most part the reviews
were so-so. It seemed that the critics were bothered by the fact that
it was Garcia's love letter to Cuba and therefore wrote it off as self
indulgent. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of paying attention to
those critics and waited to see it on cable. Obviously I enjoyed the
film and now wish that I could have seen it on the big screen simply
because it deserves that kind of respect. In other words I find it rare
that Hollywood releases a film worth buying a ticket for (sometimes
even for Oscar nominated films).

Therefore, I have taken to watching older movies simply because it
seems to me that most contemporary filmmakers are scared to make films
with metaphors, symbols, motifs, etc. Are contemporary critics scared
to praise a film that utilizes these important narrative elements?
Sometimes I wonder...

Yes, this film is a love letter to Cuba and the screen displays the
blood, sweat and tears Garcia went through to get it shown to the
public. That alone is commendable but the acting, the cinematography
and most importantly the script are high caliber. Self indulgent? Not
at all, but it does display Garcia's feelings about the contentious
issue of pre-revolutionary versus post-revolutionary Cuba. It's clear
that his version of Che Guevara conflicts with ""The Motorcycle Diaries""
version but putting that aside his biases are not historically
inaccurate. This is Garcia's Cuba and therefore we are seeing it
through the experiences of Fico who for the most part doesn't play an
active role in the government or in the revolution. He's not a
politician, he's an entertainer whose world is disrupted by a new
popular ""faceless"" ideology (note that we never see an actor portray
Fidel to the camera, his back is all we ever see). He's neither a fan
of the old regime and all he sees in the new regime is the same all
over again.

Once this is made clear the film explores Fico's personal crisis
through metaphor. Take the role of ""The Writer"" played mysteriously by
Bill Murray who introduces himself as a stand up comedian as a good
example of a narrative device. The only time Bill's character shows up
are at moments that are tense. He plays a sort of ""fool"" type character
(not unlike the fool in King Lear) who adds commentary to what's going
on. It is almost as if it were Fico's consciousness traveling with him
and troubling him all at once. Notice that he has no name and it's made
clear throughout the film that when he's asked his name he either
changes the subject or is interrupted before he says anything.

However, the greatest metaphor in the film is the role that Aurora
embodies. She is the physical representation of Cuba, better yet, she
IS Cuba. This allows Garcia's Fico to express his feelings towards his
""lost City"". Note that she was once married by another man who died
with his ideals (like a country who goes from one government to the
next) and has now moved onto becoming the ""Widow of the Revolution""
enamored by the ideals of Fidel. This breaks Fico's heart and he
expresses his love to her, to Cuba and where he stands in this hostile
climate.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not praising the film for its politics and
I won't express here where I stand as far as the real Cuba is
concerned. What I am praising is the work as a piece of art. Garcia
took great care in creating something personal but also something most
exiled Cubans and probably most exiled people of any country could
relate to. This care resulted in a powerful display of film-making, the
kind of film-making that unfortunately doesn't break box office
records. That's why I wished I had seen it on the big screen, just so I
could add a little support to the kind of films that are rarely made.",1202256000,11,3848,4.644640234948605

2798498,5,B000OPO61U,"I was raised in Havana in the 1930s, '40s and early '50s. In 1958, visiting from the U.S., my American husband and I left our infant daughter there with my parents over New Year's Eve. We returnied to Miami to celebrate the holiday, planning to pick the baby up in a week. Next morning, our hotel was abuzz with the news that the rebels had chased Batista out. Nobody knew what was going on and there was no transportation and no telephone service, so we were frantic. A private plane we hired to fly to Havana cancelled at the last minute because no one knew what was going on. On the third day, we got on the first boat into Cuba, an old scow with bunks and straw matresses, packed to the rafters with cheering Cubanos going back to what they thought would be justice and a new, moral way of life. Wild optimism was the theme. It was amazing in Havana; taxi drivers would not take tips, young rebels posed delightedly with my Yankee husband, giving him aone of their rifles to hold and a beret to wear. There was such a wonderful feeling of excitement and promise in the air. Our baby had weathered the takeover fine, even though grocery stores had been closed for a day or two. The next day, Pan American Airways (now defunct) flew the first plane out of Rancho Boyeros Airport in Havana and we were on it. As we were climbing the portable stairs to board the plane, an American came up to my husband, very secretively, and slipped a roll of film into his jacket pocket, asking him to give it to a man who would meet him in Miami at the plane. We asked how we would know him and the answer was, ""He'll know you."" Sure enough, we were barely down the steps when we were met and relieved of our smuggled film. The man was a reporter from NBC and we saw that film on TV that night -- the first news the outside world heard and saw of the revolution's dramatic events. So it was with great anticipation that I went to see Andy Garcia's ""The Lost City"" on opening night, amid a crowd of Cuban ex-pats and Americans who had loved Cuba and visited often. There was so much emotion that night as we saw our beautiful Havana recreated, heard her music, registered the strong family feelings, felt the idealogical pull of hope against the reality of betrayal. Andy did a superb job, truly a film to watch over and over, a film that shows the triumph of strong character , that reveals the treatchery and disillusion in a movement that might have meant great things for Cuba, but instead, has reduced her to waiting out this chapter in history. It was exciting to see Havana as it was, see the familiar landmarks, catch the small, affectionate Latin gestures, hear some of the familiar names, and all of it set to music and dancing that could break your heart. Anyine who wants to recall or know what it was like in Havana's heyday and the erosive days that followed can have no better source than Andy Garcia's, ""The Lost City.""",1195689600,11,2921,4.3713235294117645

It was during the last days of December 1959; in the dark, cold cell that 16 prisoners slept on the floor while the other 16 were standing so they could lay down, but nobody was thinking about that, our only thought was that we were alive and that was the important thing; we lived hour to hour, minute to minute, second to second without knowing what the next would bring.

It was about an hour before it would be time us to change shifts when the sound of the iron door opening was heard as they threw another person into the already crowded cell.  For a moment in the darkness we couldn't tell that it was a boy some 12 to 14 years old at most who had just become our newest cellmate.  And what did you do? We all asked almost in unison.  With his bloody and beaten face he stared at us and responded ""I defended my father so they wouldn't kill him, I couldn't stop it.  Those sons of bitches murdered him.""

We all looked at each other as if to find the right words to console the boy but we couldn't find them.  We had enough of our own problems.  It had been two or three days since they had executed anyone and each day we had more hope that this would all be over. The executions are unmerciful, they take life when you need it most for you and yours, without listening to your protests or yearnings for life.

Our happiness didn't last much longer, when the door opened they called out 10, among them the boy who had been the last one in.  We had been wrong because those they called, we never again saw.

How could it be possible to take a child's life in this way?  Could it be that we were wrong and that we were to be released?  Near the wall where they conducted the executions, with his hands on his waist, paced from side to side the abominable Che Guevera.

He gave the order to bring the boy first and he ordered him to kneel in front of the wall.  We all screamed for them not to commit this crime and we offered ourselves in his place.  The boy disobeyed the order with a courage that words can't express and responded to this infamous character:  ""If you're going to kill me you're going to have to do it the way you kill a man, standing, not like a coward, kneeling.

Walking behind the boy, the Che said ""whereupon you are a brave lad...""  He unholstered his pistol and shot him in the nape of the neck so that he almost decapitated him.

We all shouted ""assassins, miserable cowards"" and so many other things.  He turned around towards us and emptied the pistol's magazine. I do not know how many of us were killed or injured.  From this horrible nightmare, from which never we managed to wake up, we realized that although wounded and in the student clinic of the Calixto Garcia hospital, one thing was clear, the only card we could play was to escape, it was our only hope of survival.

- Pierre San Martin, How Che Murdered, El Nuevo Herald December 28, 1997

""The house was among the most luxurious in Cuba,"" writes Cuban journalist Antonio Llano Montes. ''Until a few weeks prior, it had belonged to Cuba's most successful building contractor. The mansion had a boat dock, a huge swimming pool, seven bathrooms, a sauna, a massage salon and several television sets. One TV had been specially designed in the U.S. and had a screen ten feet wide and was operated by remote control (remember, this was 1959.) This was thought to be the only TV of its kind in Latin America. The mansion's garden had a veritable jungle of imported plants, a pool with waterfall, ponds filled with exotic tropical fish and several bird houses filled with parrots and other exotic birds. The habitation was something out of A Thousand and One Nights.

Llano Montes wrote the above in exile. In January 1959 he didn't go quite into such detail in his article which appeared in the Cuban magazine Carteles. He simply wrote that, ""Comandante Che Guevara has fixed his residence in one of the most luxurious houses on Tarara beach.""

Two days after his article ran, while lunching at Havana's El Carmelo restaurant, Llano Montes looked up from his plate to see three heavily armed Rebel army soldiers instructing him to accompany them. Shortly the journalist found himself in Che Guevara's La Cabana office, seated a few feet in front of the Comandante's desk which was piled with papers.

It took half an hour but Che finally made his grand entrance, ""reeking horribly, as was his custom"" recalls Llano Montes. ""Without looking at me. He started grabbing papers on his desk and brusquely signing them with 'Che.' His assistant came in and Che spoke to him over his shoulder. ""I'm signing these 26 executions so we can take care of this tonight.'

""Then he got up and walked out. Half an hour later he walks back in and starts signing more papers. Finished signing, he picks up a book and starts reading -- never once looking at me. Another half hour goes by and he finally puts the book down. 'So you're Llano Montes,' he finally sneers, 'who says I appropriated a luxurious house.'

""I simply wrote that you had moved into a luxurious house, which is the truth,"" replied Llano Montes.

""I know your tactics!"" Che shot back. ""You press people are injecting venom into your articles to damage the revolution. You're either with us or against us. We're not going to allow all the press foolishness that Batista allowed. I can have you executed this very night. How about that!""

""You'll need proof that I've broken some law"" responded Montes.

""'We don't need proof. We manufacture the proof,' Che said while stroking his shoulder length hair, a habit of his. One of his prosecutors, a man nicknamed 'Puddle-of-blood' then walked in and started talking. 'Don't let the stupid jabbering of those defense lawyers delay the executions!' Che yelled at him. 'Threaten them with execution. Accuse them of being accomplices of the Batistianos.' Then Che jerked the handful of papers from Mr. Puddle and started signing them.

""This type of thing went on from noon until 6:30 PM when Che finally turned to his aides and said. 'Get this man out of here. I don't want him in my presence.'""

He was probably expecting them to dispense with the ""archaic bourgeois detail"" of judicial proof before killing him.

Probably the reason that the film was not praised in Hollywood and the critic world, is because it was NOT pro-Castro.

2798510,4,B000OPO61U,"In his feature-film directorial debut, Andy Garcia uses the screen as his canvas to paint a vibrant and wistful picture of a Havana he never really knew firsthand. In 1961, Garcia's parents fled the prison that Cuba had become under Fidel Castro. Alarmed at the sight of their five-year-old boy Andrs marching in their front yard and singing the communist hymn The Internationale, they decided to leave Cuba to raise their family in Miami Beach.
The Lost City represents Garcia's quest of sixteen years to tell this epic story of a Cuban family's struggle to grapple with the turbulent events of the communist overthrow of strong-arm dictator Fulgencio Batista in 1958--events that inevitably tear the family asunder. The film's dramatic, moving script is the final screenplay penned by the late, legendary Cuban novelist Guillermo Cabrera Infante. An early supporter of the Castro revolution, Infante's gradual disillusionment with the communist dictator forced him to flee in 1966.

The Lost City revolves around nightclub owner Fico Fellove (Garcia), who runs the El Tropico, the ritziest cabaret in downtown Havana, and his two brothers, Ricardo (Enrique Murciano) and Luis (Nestor Carbonell). The movie opens with an elaborate dance scene onstage at the club, where Fico's extended family celebrates his parents' anniversary. But as soon as the camera lurks backstage, the audience discovers that all is not well in the family, nor in Havana.

Fico's father, university professor Don Federico--played with great intelligenceby Tomas Milian (one of many Cuban expatriates among the cast and crew)--holds court in Fico's office, arguing for reasoned, democratic opposition to the brutal Batista regime. But overzealous son Ricardo predicts that a coming revolution will free the oppressed people of Cuba. Heated discussion escalates into a violent confrontation between patriarch and prodigal son, and Fico and Luis have to forcibly restrain their brother. The rift within the family ominously symbolizes the divisions that have broken out in the Fellove's island paradise, once known as the ""Pearl of the Antilles.""

In the tragic saga that chronicles the Fellove family's dissolution, Fico loses both brothers: Luis is executed by secret police when caught as the ringleader of an [...] attempt on Batista, and Ricardo commits suicide after betraying his family to win favor with the communists. The meaning of the movie's title emerges as we see what has been lost; the film becomes an elegiac love letter to the graceful and glamorous world in which Fico moves, but which is now slipping through his fingers as the communists impose control over every aspect of Cuban society.

Elaborate musical and dance sequences, featuring the impulsive Afro-Cuban rhythms that define Cuban music, set off the onscreen action. Rumba and mambo show-stoppers make The Lost City the kind of fusion of light entertainment and serious drama that American movie studios have forgotten how to make. But what most grabbed me were the ballet scenes, featuring the lithe agility of dancer Lorena Feijo, who in real life is principal ballerina for the San Francisco Ballet.

This kind of filmmaking threw many critics for a loop. But for me, The Lost City comes off more like a Bollywood extravaganza than does the mostly anemic ""serious"" fare Hollywood serves up these days. The most convincing scenes are in the love story between Fico and brother Luis's aggrieved widow, Aurora, played by the exquisite Ins Sastre. Emmanuel Kadosh's camera simply loves her serene, alluring beauty: as Fico falls for her, so do all the men in the audience.

Most crucially, Infante and Garcia don't whitewash or gloss over the true history of Fidel Castro's tyrannical rise to power: he is shown for exactly the brutal dictator he was and is. One wouldn't think that actor Jsu Garcia's portrayal of Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara as a murderous goon--rather than as the Martyred Saint of the People--would be controversial almost forty years after his death, but it has caused The Lost City to be banned in many Latin American countries.
Although uneven in a couple of scenes, the film overall is gripping and beautifully made, full of forceful, evocative performances that would make any new director proud. In a memorable cameo, Dustin Hoffman nails gangster Meyer Lansky's quietly menacing demeanor. Fans of The Incredibles's sultry ""Mirage"" character will get a glimpse of actress Elizabeth Pea playing a communist bureaucrat who threatens to shut down Fico's nightclub, unless he removes the orchestra's saxophone (""an instrument of imperialist oppression""). Bill Murray provides comic relief as ""the Writer,"" an obvious stand-in for novelist Infante. Some of his jokes fall flat, but altogether he injects a sense of uneasiness that foreshadows the beginning of the end for Fico's fortunes.

Emmanuel Kadosh's vibrant cinematography bathes the screen in rich hues reminiscent of Gordon Willis' Technicolor prints of The Godfather, Part II (also filmed in the Dominican Republic). Production designer Waldemar Kalinowski and art director Carlos Menndez re-create a rich, elegant Havana, adding first-rate production values to this low-budgeted movie.

Oddly, The Lost City was panned by most critics in the U.S., presumably for its length and uneven execution. However, after reading many of the reviews, I suspect more than just a little opposition to be rooted in politics rather than aesthetics. Typical of the reviews was Stephen Holden's in the New YorkTimes:

The impoverished masses of Cubans who embraced Castro as a liberator appear only in grainy, black-and-white news clips, awkwardly shoehorned into the movie to fill in historical blanks, and in some buffoonish parodies of sour Communist apparatchiks barking orders once Mr. Castro takes over.
Almost fifty years after Castro seized power and turned Cuba into a death camp and a sewer, its suffering captives still risk shark-infested waters and treacherous currents to reach the freedom of America's shores. Yet to many American Baby Boomers, nostalgic over the red ""Che"" t-shirts of their pampered college years, the nightmare reality just ninety miles from American shores might as well be invisible.

Earlier this summer, when the aging Castro went under the knife and, for the first time, temporarily relinquished power to his brother Raul, you could witness more accurately what Cuba's muzzled masses probably felt: thousands of Cuban-Americans of all ages and incomes filled downtown Miami, celebrating Fidel's impending demise, waving Cuban and American flags, literally dancing in the streets.

In The Lost City, this same spirit moves Fico Fellove, who chooses to live and work alone in poverty and freedom, as a dishwasher in New York City, rather than as a slave in the socialist ""paradise"" of Havana:

I can't go back. It's too dangerous...for my soul. I have no money. But here, I feel as though I'm worth more than I ever was.",1179619200,11,6970,5.280685920577618

It provides concrete examples of why it's so horrible...everything from taking your property to having to leave your family.  It also briefly shows the jails where so many political prisoners were held in the years to follow.  It wasn't only those that worked for Batista...in the following years, thousands of men and women were imprisoned for their political views without due process.

If that time in the history of Cuba had to be summed up in 2 hours, Andy Garcia hit the nail on the head as best as it could be done.",1170806400,5,802,4.541666666666667
2798515,3,B000OPO61U,"This movie takes place in late 1958 and early 1959. My wife was born in October 1958 but her parents would return to Cuba briefly as her father fought in the Bay of Pigs, was captured, and spent time in Castro's jail. As a result, we would be looking for more historical accuracy out of this movie more than a fictional love story. On this basis, Garcia does an okay job of including some newsreel clips and reenactments in the movie.

No doubt he is hampered by the fact that he couldn't film in the real Havana and not surprisingly there's a lot of interior shots, deserted beaches, fields, etc.

As to Garcia's Fico character running the ""best"" nightclub in Havana, this is nonsense. There were many many nightclubs before Castro and is there a best nightclub today in Las Vegas, NY, LA, etc? There were also many American vistors to Havana for most of the 1950's and tourism was a key part of the Havana economy but the movie largely ignores this fact. Some of the main characters are anti-Battista but the movie largely misses the significant and growing resistance to Castro that developed during this period. And while the movie profiles one character leaving Cuba in 1959, it doesn't capture the massive exodus from Cuba of many Cubans, Americans, and others.

Garcia acts, directs, produces, and writes the music for this ambitious movie.

Andy Garcia has surprised us thanks to his dynamic use of the eye camera, scrutinizing from a respectable distance, without the well known abuse of the close up, reserving it only for the required sequences. It explores without merciless realism, the social corpus, the personal ambitions, and the implacable twist of fate experienced by two very close members of his family; his own brother and his brother in law - both dead - the crumbling of the familiar circle as allegorical metaphor about the distortion process experienced for mesmerized people who didn't perceive the abominable reality beneath the faade.

2798526,4,B000OPO61U,"I might have given this just 2 stars if I'd only watched it once. Having had my husband come and become interested in the film, on starting over and completing a second viewing (and with the help of the DVD extras), ""The Lost City"" improved to a 4.

(My husband, while considering it ""a good film,"" rates ""The Lost City"" 3 stars because he feels doesn't show the complicity of Cuban aristocrats with Batista sufficiently.)

The first time, I was was befuddled by the appearance of Dustin Hoffman (as Meyer Lansky?!) and Bill Murray (as a rather curious nameless writer).

On second viewing, the strengths of the movie grabbed me -- the disparate fates of the three brothers, the point that love doesn't always transfer neatly a la Hollywood scriptwriting, the lushness of the El Tropico dance scenes, the purity of nightclubs without gambling, the gorgeous arc that could have been Cuba's democratic future quashed by Castro.

The film's quirks came to seem winning, almost brilliant, such as the Murray/Hoffman appearances and the background music often at odds in mood to the events unfolding on the screen. It's really a film in some ways echoes the quality and director's vision (vs. rigid Hollywood formulae) of the auteur films of the 1960s.

I agree with others that Andy Garcia shows a new nuance to his acting here, and a Mel Gibson-""The Passion"" bravery in taking on a project close to his heart but not favored by Hollywood.

The film's problem is kind of simple -- as others point out -- it's a little tricky to follow who is who. (Which man is before us now? Fico's brother? brother-in-law? brother-in-law with new Fidel-style revolutionary beard? Che? And Captain Castel, beautiful in a nightclub, and later unrecognizable after a beating.)

Yet viewers patient with these obstacles will be well-rewarded by ""The Lost City."" By repeated rituals such as at the civilized family dinner at a long table (the father: ""We are not a moveable feast. We eat at 6 p.m., and not a moment later""). Toward the end of the film, fewer and fewer family members survive as Fico moves to kiss them before seating himself, and the resulting imagery is poignant, powerful and sad.

Toward the end, we note the stunning cruelty of the death of Castel by those revolutionaries he had the decency to help based on personal ties.

Once you learn that that Garcia's love interest is an allegory for Cuba herself, her behavior becomes clear and logical. Once you learn Bill Murray's character represents the author of the screenplay, a puckish commentator on the action swirling around, his appearances make good sense. Then this becomes not just a beautiful film, sumptuous even, that could serve as a travel poster for the Dominican Republic or for the beauty of Cuban arts, but a lovely story and a work whose vision lingers after viewing.",1165881600,12,2831,4.84472049689441
2798527,5,B000OPO61U,"Andy Garcia's Lost City is very much a tour de force on the Cuban Revolution of 1958 and how that country ""achieved"" the condition it's been in ever since.  In this respect, the film compares very well with David Lean's treatment of Pasternak's Dr. Zhivago.  Apart from the obvious differences in time and place, Garcia's work centers its setting on the lost Cuban cabaret scene, with musical and dance numbers that will almost certainly never be matched.  This fills the same function as Lean's majestic cinematography of Moscow and the Urals in Zhivago and in each case the focal point really is the film.

That isn't to say though that it is lacking in fine performances.  Most of the Hispanic actors other than Garcia may not be particularly familiar to North American audiences, but the acting is excellent in a project where many of them worked for scale plus in a labor of love.  As might be expected, director/star Garcia leads the way with a performance full of subtleties of expression that I quite frankly thought was beyond him. By way of comparison, the very best aspects of his performance in the last third of Godfather III are distilled to quality and sensitivity a hundred times better than he showed there.

Ordinarily, I would expect such a fine performance to be a launching pad for many more mature roles than he's played to date, but this doesn't take into account the great risk Garcia took in producing a film hostile to Castro and communists.  Undoubtedly this puts him at great risk in the Twenty First Century world of Hollywood, where those figures are considered heroes, if not secular saints. In fact, Garcia is quite open in stating that he was forced to go outside of the normal Hollywood funding sources in order to finance The Lost City.  One can only hope that such a finely crafted film and performance will be appropriately recognized and not punished in the Marxist milieu of the American film industry. The Lost City is a product of great courage of conviction,  which is rewarded in almost every aspect of the performances.",1164758400,34,2063,4.769662921348314

2798529,2,B000OPO61U,"The Lost City was nicely shot, had some striking imagery, and a great soundtrack. I appreciated the perspective on a bit of history that many people my age know only from The Godfather: Part II. And it was critical of Castro without being *too* heavy-handed or manipulative, which was a nice surprise.

But the morning after watching it, I could not remember what the movie was about. Seriously, I had to read reviews here just to remind myself what the plot was. It wasn't confusing or complicated. It was just so totally forgetable that all I could recall were a hanful of shots and images that stood out as being particularly moving or artistic.

The editorial review above sums it up pretty well: ""Unfortunately, at the heart of the movie is stasis.""

Yep. Nothing much happens. Sure there's the revolution, but the main characters seem to be somewhat insulated from the changes going on around them. No major shift in lifestyle. No decline in quality of life. The only tangible thing that changes is the number of people sitting around the family table. Speaking of which, even the deaths were boring. Whenever a character died, he did so in the most convenient way possible, without generating any lasting drama.

Normally I like character-driven stories, but the characters in this movie were not interesting enough to move the story along. The main character, played by Andy Garcia, was as bland as they come. He's the charming, successful everyman who dislikes the new government, disapproves of his brothers' involvement, but he's just too darn nice to get in anyone's face about it. Can we call him a Mary Sue? It doesn't have to be just a fanfic/D&D/nerd term, does it? His only flaw was his inertia! I kept waiting for him to get disillusioned enough to do something -- anything -- drastic, like the guy in Bitter Sugar.

2798538,4,B000OPO61U,"I like this film very much, for both its message and its sincere attempt to portray a fascinating period of Latin American history, despite its numerous weaknesses.  It managed to boast, on a fairly small budget, an interesting cast, gorgeous locations evocative of the beauty that was pre-revolutionary Cuba, political intrigue, beautiful women and handsome men - what more could a film need?  The answer is a coherent script, and unfortunately the script for this film does not quite do the production justice.

The main problem, it seemed to me, was that the producers and screenwriter couldn't make up their mind whether or not this was to be a political drama or a love story, and foolishly attempted a combination of the two.  The film does effectively approximate the gorgeous atmosphere, wonderful music and stunning scenery that 1958 Cuba possessed, and this is its main strength.  It also managed to delicately balance disdain for the Batista regime with disapproval of the revolutionary ""heroes"", but the story gets bogged down in the relationship between the main character and his brother's widow, a love story that is far less interesting than the revolution that frames it.  I found myself wishing that they would stop focusing on romance and get back to the brutality of the Batista regime and the selfishness of the communist revolution.

Throughout the film, the character of Fico appears overly impressed by his own self-importance, even while his efforts to intercede in the events unfolding around him are totally ineffectual.  The nameless ""writer"" played by Bill Murray is completely out of synch with the story line, although his character does manage to supply one or two wry comments on the proceedings and is therefore not a total waste.  Dustin Hoffman is convincing as the mobster Meyer Lansky, who is one of the few recognizable characters in the piece.  From the reviews, I was awaiting the appearance of Che Guevera as one of the characters.  In the film, the revolutionaries all seemed to resemble each other, and I was never sure which one was supposed to be Che.  For the most part, the guerillas were portrayed as misguided juveniles, uncorking a genie whose propensity for tragic upheaval they couldn't quite foresee, much less control.

I decided when it was over that the films greatest overall strength was the depiction of the effects of the revolution on Fico's family.  There were especially fine performances by the actor and actress who played Fico's parents.

As a fairly low-budget story on the effect of the Cuban revolution on one family, I give the film A for effort.  And the musical moments were every bit as breathtaking as the spot-on scenery and faithful sets, in particular the actor who portrayed Benny More.  But for two hours and twenty minutes of screen time, I would have liked to have seen more of the revolution and the resulting repression, with a little less emphasis on the mediocre love story.",1162252800,8,2960,4.971602434077079

Great costumes, OK considering the tight budget (9 Million) but a little narcisitic and to much focus on a bizzare love affair. Bill Murray is funny as alawys but perhaps out of place. As for the Castro apologist, this movie is accurate both in portraying Batista's violent (and deadly) hold on power, and Castro's bloody triumph and aftermath (property confiscation scenes are very accurate). Sad that this movie will not be released in South America because of the realistic depiction of Che Guevara as a cold blooded killer, I guess some folks can't handle the truth.",1161302400,6,678,4.754237288135593
2798540,3,B000OPO61U,"It's been attempted several times before, that is, a sweeping epic of the last days of the Batista regime and the beginning of Castro's Cuba in 1958-59. In hindsight, it is a fascinating period full of intertwining personal and political passions. However, despite the dramatic ripeness of the period, nobody has done a completely successful job in capturing the fulsome emotional fervor (probably closest is Julian Schnabel's ""Before Night Falls"", which shows the revolution through the weary eyes and brutalizing experiences of gay poet Reinaldo Arenas). With his dramatic feature film directorial debut, Andy Garcia attempts more of a Zhivago-style approach with this lumbering 2005 film, but he get seriously hamstrung by unmemorable characters and an incoherent narrative structure that seems to rely on a series of genuinely striking images and emotional outbursts to tie the plot threads together.

Written by the late Cuban novelist G. Cabrera Infante (a superb writer whose limitations as a film scenarist are unfortunately highlighted here), the story is focused on Federico ""Fico"" Fellove, the Bogart-like owner of the Tropicana-like ""El Tropico"" nightclub in Havana, a glamorous watering hole that you know will act as the movie's central metaphor for the Cuba about to be traumatized by political upheaval. He is surrounded by a gallery of characters who suffer in one way or the other at the hands of the revolution, in particular, his rebellious brothers, Luis and Ricardo, as well as Luis' heartbroken wife, Aurora. Fellove eventually forsakes his homeland but not before the movie goes through an unwieldy alternation between often vividly rendered historical events (with actors portraying the key historical figures of Castro, Guevara and Batista) and the personal ramifications on the characters.

At a yawn-inducing 143 minutes, the movie feels endless because of the weakly developed script, which is not helped by distracting cameos from Bill Murray as an acerbic American expatriate writer and Dustin Hoffman as gangster Meyer Lansky. As Fellove, Garcia, generally a more interesting actor, is far too elliptical to elicit sympathy for his eventual fate, as he seems to be posturing toward a romantic anti-hero archetype without exhibiting any real dexterity for it. The rest of the performances vary in quality, though Tomas Milian and the rarely-seen Millie Perkins are affecting as Fellove's parents and the beautiful Ins Sastre generates true poignancy as Aurora. As a filmmaker, Garcia should be applauded for bringing the elaborate movie in under $10 million, as production designer Waldemar Kalinowski and costumer Deborah Lynn Scott do a fine job recreating the flamboyant colors of the period. Unfortunately, this effort is somewhat betrayed by Emmanuel Kadosh's flat, unimaginative cinematography. Garcia himself wrote the evocative background music.

It's a noble effort for an actor intent on showcasing his first country's fascinating roots, but it also highlights how little we have in current cinema of the artistic caliber of romantic epic filmmakers like David Lean. I think Sydney Pollack's ""Havana"" comes a little closer to the mark even if his is a more blatant rip-off of ""Casblanca"", and even more evocative is Mikheil Kalatozishvili's 1964 politically motivated documentary, the Soviet-Cuban ""I Am Cuba"". The 2006 DVD includes an interesting commentary track by Garcia, Kalinowski and actor Nestor Carbonell who plays Luis. There is also a 37-minute making-of feature as well as ten thankfully deleted scenes, an interesting description of the real cigar plantation in the film, and several photo galleries.",1160870400,7,3654,5.463716814159292

2798543,4,B000OPO61U,"This film could have been a great film with great music, great dancing and great entertainment. Could have been but is not. It is so nostalgic about the past that it forgets to show the frightening connection between the bloody dictatorship of Battista and the necessary armed struggle to get rid of him. In such a situation excess often follows previous excessive violence, especially when we take into account the fact that this dictatorship was supported and even promoted by the big northern neighbor, creating a national longing and feeling that emulated the Cubans into supporting Castro's national movement. The film locks up the debate, if it is a debate, between three brothers. One assassinated by Battista, one joining Castro's movement, and the third one dreaming of what Cuba used to be and what it should be again. Then the film can reduce Castro's movement to unconscious and romantic teenagers who do not know the price nor the taste of life and culture. Then rationing is hinted at as the only reality for Cubans in spite of the fact that for the first time in the history of the island and Latin America education became complete and free, just like medicine and medical assistance. In other words the film misses the only interesting question which is not about 1959 but about now: how is the island going to change and move to its own future? Is that change going to come from outside or from inside? Is that change going to be a revenge or a new stage in the national history of the island? The only thing that is clear is the fact that Castro kicked the maffia out. Is the future synonymous of its or their return? Unluckily we do not get even the slightest beginning of an answer or even a question about the future. We have to be satisfied with the nostalgic vision of the past.

Although the critics haven't been very nice towards the movie, this film is a small masterpiece and a favorite amongst audiences. Amazing how Gracia made this film for such a small budget and still make something that is absolutely wortwhile to see! Congrats!

The movie is told in a certain way that you love or you hate it. For example: there is a lot of Cuban music in the film, that is ritmic and great for the ears. Garcia used the music in almost every scene, going from a serious dramatic scene to a happy scene, which is a masterfull way of telling a story. Some of the most dramatic moments have ritmic, almost happy music playing which gives the film a certain feel. Now this kind of telling you will love or you will hate.
I loved it, cause it is special and feels just right.

The acting is superb: Andy Garcia also plays the leading role and does this with pasion and a lot of fun. He knows how to act and shows this. With a hilarious role of Bill Murray, who is a bit unnessesary in the film, but still brings a lot of humor to the seriousness of the film. Also, Dustin Hoffman has a small but nice part that fits the film. Than there is the beautiful Ins Sastre, who plays the love intrest with passion and great romance.
There is some action in this film that is very bloody and pure realistic that captures the situation of the revolution in 1958/1959 perfectly. Garcia's personal opinion of the Cuban revolution comes into frame very clearly. So if you are a supporter of Fidel, you might not like this film very much.

Now if something is prefectly fine in this film, it are the locations: beautiful shots of a Cuba in the fifties and great nature shots. Beautifully filmed on a special way. Pure eyecandy and great enjoyment: Bravo.

2798547,3,B000OPO61U,"The design and acting of the film is superb, and on those merits, it should get a 5, but by the end of the film, I felt like I had been bombarded with the Miami Cuban Exile political propaganda, that it really took away from the film.

The movie does reveal that Batista was a dictator (an admission even exiles are forced to surrender), but does so in a very ambigious way.  One is not shown the grinding poverty of the Cuban masses nor the rampant torture that occured under his regime.  At best, one is shown a few executions by Batista thugs to accentuate his reign.  And Garcia's family is portrayed as being ""above the fray"", neither Castrista nor Batista (an very historically unlikely prospect, if we are to believe Garcia's family owned properties and cabarets on the island).  A convenient moral absolution...we're shown that they're dispossesed of their properties after the revolution, but never that they had any dealings with Batista or the government to acquire or keep them.  Real political linkages between the economic upper class and the new regime are conveniently ignored, and instead we're giving the simplicity of ""yeah, Batista was bad, but Fidel took our lands for no reason"".

When it came time for the movie to portray Castro's revolutionaries, I was struck in how awfully and transparently propagandistically they were portrayed.  There's not a SINGLE courteous, respectful, or thinking revolutionary.  Che Guevara is a ruthless killer (at times he was, but not always) who is cynical, pushy, and rude.  Always with a cheshire-cat grin and arrogance.  The female revolutionary head of the musicians' union is a two-faced, musically ignorant, and arrogant woman who, from the moment she meets Garcia, has no respect for him.  The airport guard that takes his jewels when he leaves for exile is emotionless as he takes his father's heirloom watch.  His brother Ricardo (who was a follower of Fidel) is shown as being brainwashed by Fidel's political ideology, to the point that he'd betray his family and cause so much anguish to his uncle, that he provokes his death-dealing heart attack. And so on.  The revolution is painted with a broad and completely negative tone.

The film could have done a great job if it took the road of movies like ""Fidel!""  It would have been excellent to portray the ideological-rigidity of the Castro regime (banning certain types of music for their imperialistic content, taking the jewels in the airport, dispossession of the lands, etc.) if it would have contextualized their reality, instead of just bombarding the viewer with scene after scene of the ""big, bad Fidelistas"".  It would have been fair to also show WHY the revolution occured...and why the masses were strongly support in Fidel.  It would have been fair to show the brutality and living conditions of Cubans under Batista...and so on.  The movie's focus is young, revolutionary Cuba, so it has no room for displaying Castro's later regime (the more mature, more communist system), but if it did have that space, it would not be unfair to portray the regime's mistakes, excesses, and negative aspects.

In short...this film struck me as a Miami Cuban Exile's perfect orgasmic orgy.  Every Miami Cuban will identify with one of the character...every Miami Cuban will cheer when Garcia faces Castro and Guevara and lets them know his thoughts.  Every Miami Cuban will lament every rude Fidelista action portrayed in the film, and so on.  But when it comes to historical reality, this movie is as accurate as watching a Cuban-government made propaganda newsreel.  They're both fictitious, over-the-top, and exaggerated.

I recommend people watch a film like ""Fidel!"" instead, for a more balanced view.",1157846400,5,3723,5.014634146341463

He was a member of the upper middle class who dreamed of a democratic form of government for Cuba. My father fought against Batista's oppressive and brutal regime, just like Luis did. There were many times my Dad could've been killed by Batista's henchmen. I wouldn't be here writing this review if that had happened. At one point Dad had to leave the country. He was exiled in Venezuela in 1958, the year before Castro took over the island. Young idealists, like Dad, and Luis, made Fidel's rise to power a reality. However, most had no idea Castro would become a totalitarian dictator who would destroy the island of Cuba.

The film's portrayal of what happened to Fico's family was right on the money. Many Cuban families were split apart during that turbulent period. Some families were politically divided, others were separated by the exile of family members who fled Fidel's regime. My family was no exception to this rule. The revolution made enemies of friends, and even family members. Fidel was, and continues to be, a dividing force for many Cubans on both sides of the Florida straits.

I just finished watching the movie at 11:15PM and suddenly I have a hankering for a ""media noche."" For those of you not familiar with it, a ""media noche"" is a snack size petite Cuban sandwich named after midnight. I wish I could just slip into my red dress and go dancing in old Havana. Beny More and his Afro-Cuban band is a favorite of mine. What I'd give to have seen him perform live on the stage. Oh, how I wish I had a time machine to go back to that era!

On a more serious note, I noticed another reviewer from Rhode Island evaluated the film on a political level. That individual said that ""Fidel!"" offers a more 'balanced' portrayal of Castro's Revolution and Batista's regime. If there is one film that is truly transparently propagandistically about Cuba, I'd say that ""Fidel!"" would definitely be 'it.' Needless to say that it is a pro-socialist-pro-communist documentary romanticizing one of history's most ignominious totalitarian dictators.

I wonder if the reviewer has ever lived in Cuba, or if s/he is truly familiar with Cuba's history. Does this reviewer know that many members of the Cuban aristocracy financed Fidel's rise to power? Just as it was portrayed in The Lost City, some members of the upper class not only paid with their wealth but with the blood of their sons and daughters. Not all rich Cuban families owed their societal standing to Batista. Many wealthy Cuban families had been landowners since before Cuba gained independence from Spain. Batista had staged a military coup d'tat in 1952, removing the prior elected leader, Carlos Pro. The brutalities committed under Batista's regime were real, but not nearly as horrific as the atrocities perpetrated against those who dared oppose Fidel Castro.",1157760000,11,3438,4.820338983050847
2798549,3,B000OPO61U,"Music dominates this episode in history when Marxism in the form of Castro took over political control of Cuba in 1959.  Bastista barely escaped with his life; they were intent on killing him as they did many innocent people during the takeover.  Many changes took place immediately as all the land and the tobacco crops now belonged to the Revolution.  The land will endure, but Fidel Castro will pass -- not so, he still has total control after almost fifty years.

None of the lyrics are in English, though two of the main actors were Americans and portrayed pivital players in the life of Revolution Cuba.  If you like Spanish music, predominately Cuban, the soundtrack which is not available to review would be a sound investment.  If you want to hear this kind of Spanish music on a regular basis, Kent Emmons hosts a Martini Time from Branson, Missouri, on the radio; he calls it ""saltsa.""

Cuba is the island Ernest Hemingway loved, located between the Bahamas and Jamaica.  Life on the island would never be the same, oppression of the populace by military violence and presence.  After Castro got in power, no saxophones were allowed to be played in the clubs.  We hear a piano solo, and a marching band saluting Castro's entry into Havana.  When the harassed cabaret owner decided to leave and go to New York City, the mecca of show business in the Fifties, they put on a Jewish farewell like in ""Fiddler on the Roof"" as young Fico begins his journey to start life anew in a free, democratic country as so many of his fellowmen did, including Mimi Blanco and her family.  The airport guard kept their valuables, including his father's pocket watch.  Some left with visas, others escaped.  We should have known that she was a heartbreaker.  Is there no end to this madness!  She was so beautiful and he kept the home movies to watch and remember.  You're angry with me?  No, anger would be too simple, my sincere friend.  The guilt of omission is as great as the guilt of commission.

From the tropical heat of Havana to snow falling in New York Fico starts out as a dishwasher.  It's better to live in poverty in a free world than as a captive in a lost city, he decided.  I have no money, but I feel I am worth more than I ever was.  He was recognized and offered a new club in Las Vegas, Nevada, with a floor show, by Meyer Lansky played by Dustin Hoffman who used a lot of goodbye lines such as ""Goodbye, Mrs. Calabash, wherever you are"" (Jimm Durante's farewell each show he did on television) and ""Give my regard to the pigeons.""  Did you ever have the feeling that you want to go, to cast your fate to the winds.

The love of his life visited and weepingly said, ""I'm sorry you left.  I'll always love you.""  He told her simply, ""It's dangerous to my soul to return; I have loyalty to a lost cause and will endure no master.""  He stays in New York and became a success and relived the glory of old Cuba on his home movies.",1157155200,6,2939,4.442990654205608
2798550,4,B000OPO61U,"I just finished watching this movie and just had to buy it. I also bought the soundtrack. As a former Cuban national, like Andy Garcia, the appeal of the movie to me was nostalgia about Havana prior to the Castro revolution of January, 1959.

Andy Garcia does a superb job of depicting life in Cuba (mainly Havana) before the revolution. I am roughly Andy Garcia's age, so the times depicted in the movie are part of my childhood. My parents on the other hand experienced the turbulent times depicted in the movie. They saw and experienced the discontent with the Batista regime and admired the young (mostly rich and middle class) people involved in removing Batista. Little did they know that they were replacing one dictator with a worse one.

If you love music, watch this movie. If you would like to see a picture of Havana the way it was, watch this movie. If you went to Havana in the 50s and want to remember what it was like, watch this movie.

The movie does seem to drag a bit in the middle, but it made Cuba come alive for me in a way no other movie has. It was also a labor of love for Andy Garcia, taking him sixteen years to get the movie produced. I encourage everyone who wants movies made that don't fit the typical Hollywood model to watch this movie.",1156723200,11,1270,4.372881355932203
2798551,5,B000OPO61U,"The culmination of a 16 year dream by Andy Garcia, it's set in Cuba in the late 50's and follows Garcia's character and his extended family as they, and the rest of the country slowly fall apart with the arrival of the revolution.

Garcia's character is a night club owner that features Cuban music and Cuban dancing, so a large theme of the music is what is lost with the arrival of the communists, Cuban culture and the beauty and civility of old Cuba, even considering as bad as Bautista was.

 The acting is great, but being Hollywood, an anti-communist nostalgic look at old Cuba didn't fly in the major studios, so Garcia had it indepently made.

On the plus side, the women are extraordinarily beautiful, the music is great, Dustin Hoffman plays an American mob boss and best of all, Bill Murray plays an anti-communist stand-up comedian (his role has some of the best anti-communist lines I've ever heard in a movie).

The movie is rated ""R"" for some violence when Bautista and the communists engage in some brutality. I only recall 1 swear word (and that was appropriate for the time), and sex was only alluded to, not shown. It's a keeper.",1156550400,12,1149,4.612745098039215
2798552,5,B000OPO61U,"This is Andy Garcia's second movie on the impact of Fidel's revolution on the lives of Cubans, especially the musical artists.  Beautifully filmed, great music, with excellent character & plot development, it shows that while Cuban life under  Batista was far from ideal, things got much worse under Castro.

We had a little difficulty following the characters early on. Bill Murray's role seemed  puzzling an superfluous at times, but at other times, the wry wit & observations were right on. The extra feature interview of Garcia quotes Murray as saying he loved the script & wanted to particpate, even though no one would see the movie. Bill is obviously a smart Hollywood guy as the film got very little theater play, a real sad commentary on what the American public wants.  I highly recommend this movie along with Garcia's other Cuban film ""For Love or Country - The Arturo Sandoval Story""",1156204800,11,896,4.9072847682119205

The casting was brilliant and the acting very compelling---you could tell that for many of them the movie was ""personal.""  Amazing that this film made it to the screen given its honest portrayal of the brutal architects of the Cuban revolution, particularly Hollywood's darlings, Che Guevara and Fidel Castro.  I can't help but laugh (although I should cry) every time I see the blissfully ignorant adulation for Che and company...perhaps if more people see the movie they might think twice before sporting their ugly mugs on their t-shirts....way to go Andy!",1155686400,55,955,4.981132075471698
2798554,4,B000OPO61U,"THE LOST CITY represents a 16-year dream come true for Director Andy Garcia.  As he conversationally explains in a very fine addendum to the DVD of his film, this film is an obsession, a work of love that allowed him to revisit the country of his birth through understanding the changes through the sounds of intoxicating music.  If at times this movie seems to lag in storyline because of all the interruptive musical numbers, those lags are some of the finest part of this richly colorful, beautifully photographed (in the Dominican Republic), well written by Guillermo Cabrera Infante romantic view of Cuba's turbulent history in the 1950s.

Fico Fellove, owner of the famous Tropico nightclub in 1958 Havana, is a member of a wealthy, intensely close family who despite any other commitments meet for dinners at 6 PM sharp each day.  But there is revolution in the air and the family, headed by father Tomas Milian, mother Millie Perkins, uncle Richard Bradford, and sons Luis (Nestor Carbonell) with wife Aurora (Ines Satre) and Ricardo (Enrique Murciano) react in varying ways. As Batista's dictatorship begins to be challenged the family responds: Ricardo aligns with Fidel Castro and Che Guevara (intensely portrayed by fine actor Jsu Garcia) while Luis aligns with counterrevolutionaries.  While the battle builds Fico is fighting his own inner wars with big time crime - Meyer Lansky (Dustin Hoffman) who wants to alter his club, and the soldiers who would abuse his Tropico, kill his lead singer, and murder his close friend Captain Castel (Steven Bauer).

The Revolution happens and the story is centered on how it disseminates the Fellove family.  While Fico's brothers struggle Fico decides to escape to America, leaving behind all that he loved - family, Aurora whom he promised Luis he would marry if Luis died, and the memories conjured by the Cuban music.  How the tale ends is understood and appreciated best by Cuban exiles, but Garcia brings those feelings of mixed emotions about Cuba pre and post revolution to all of us.

There are many interesting sidebars to this film: Bill Murray plays 'the writer' who seems to be a mixture of a Greek chorus and Fico's sublimated self; the tobacco/cigar industry is carefully examined; the 'face' of the Fidel regime is focused in the personage of soldier/guard Miliciana Mu&ntilde;oz (Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a) who embodies the totalitarian downside of the promised 'revolution'.  And the musical numbers, well choreographed, designed, and performed, serve as inserted relief in the more tense moments - such as the storming of Batista's palace.

The movie clocks in at 2 1/2 hours and while it seems there is little that could have been excised from the original, certainly more character motivation and development would have made for a better understanding of the plot.  But in all this is a movie made out of love by a fine cast and shows Garcia as a capable director in his first directorial outing.  And oh the music!

2798555,5,B000OPO61U,"I am 34 years old woman, I was born in Cuba and left with my parents in 1979.  I learned so much watching this movie and wished that I was not robbed of the CUBA that once was.

This movie showed the Cuba that was left to a man (Castro) that hates his people and has destroyed not only a country, but families.  And Che Guevarra, that was not a HERO as most people see him but a callous murderer.

The love of country and music of my people was depicted so beautifully by Andy.  The scenes of the beaches, as I know that they were not filmed in Cuban it reminded me of my childhood vacations with my parents in the beaches we were allowed to go.

It is amazing to me how the mind tends to forget unpleasant thoughts, and how anything just triggers all repressed memories.  As, Andy was leaving Cuba I remembered (even as young as I was) the way my mother cried when her wedding ring that was passed down from generation to generation was taken from her finger because it was ""government property.""  Or how I remember my Abuelita and Tia Maria waiving good bye to us from the balcony of Jose Marti Aeropuerto.  Little did I know that would be the last time I saw them.  I shouldn't have worn make up that day...as I saw my mother to my right and my father cry as they relived that tragic day.

2798556,4,B000OPO61U,"Andy Garcia does a superb job of telling the story of Cuba from the perspective of one family caught in the turmoil of the revolution.

(Spoilers!)

It is the story of one family composed of 3 brothers, one is a musician whose life revolves around his family and his music lounge;one brother is a student at university--it is not clear what the other one's occupation is. Their father is a university professor who believes in Ghandi's philosophy of passive resistance. But one brother is captivated by Fidel Castro and joins the rebels. The other brother is also lured into the political fray and only Andy Garcia's character,

Fico, is apolitical.

There is a parallelism in the break up of the country with the break up of the family. Family affinities are either strengthened or discarded depending on which side of the revolution one chooses to ally one's self with. This is the tragedy that is Cuba--it deposed a bloody dictator with a bloodier one.

Similarly, Fico's love for Aurora (his brother's widow) parallels his love for his Cuba. He loves her and he will love her forever; yet, he has to go away. Aurora chooses to stay in Cuba--she believes that communism is the the road to follow; Fico chooses to leave for New York--freedom is non-negotiable--it holds the highest value in his heart.

Wonderful story telling and directing from Andy Garcia. He presents this heartbreaking story with passion and understanding of its turbulent history. The poem at the end of the film is equally haunting in its beauty...to quote a portion:

""Todo es hermoso y constante, Todo es musica y rezo, Y todo, como el diamante, Antes que luz, es carbon.""

(Everything is beautiful and faithful, Everything is music and prayer, And everything--like the diamond, Before it sparkles, is coal."")

Forgive me if I translated it wrong; maybe someone can translate it more accurately and lyrically. But you get the idea.

2798558,5,B000OPO61U,"In watching The Lost City, you have to evaluate it on two levels.  One is the purely cinematic approach, or simply is it a good movie, and the other is from a historical/political statement point of view.

As a movie the best parts are the beautiful photography, locations, costumes and music.  It really is a treat for the eyes and the ears.  Is it long? yes it's long.  But after seeing the film for the second time, I can't see where there was room for a lot of trimming.

Overall the acting in the film was good, with some weak spots.  As a movie it's definitely worth seeing and the film doesn't deserve a lot of the negative reviews it's gotten.  I suspect those have more to do with the political/historical aspects of the film which I referred to before.

This film will offend a lot of people that have bought into the idea of Fidel Castro as a benevolent dictator and Che Guevara as a righteous revolutionary.  This film exposes them for the cruel opportunists that they are/were.

The film makes no bones about the need to remove the (then) dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista but also unequivocally shows that what happened next was far worse for all involved.

Some have criticized this film for not showing ""the grinding poverty"" of the masses in pre-Castro Cuba.  There's a reason for that.  There wasn't that much of it back then.  The Cuban revolution was one led and funded by the middle and upper classes and supported by intellectuals throughout the island.  They wanted democracy not a totalitarian dictatorship.

Cabrera-Infante, the screenplay author does a great job in showing us the differing approaches to getting rid of Batista by putting one of Fico's (Andy Garcia) brothers in the 26th of July movement (Castro's group) and another in the Revolutionary Directorate (a competing revolutionary group).  In the end Castro's group seizes power and squashes opposition.  In other words, the bad guys won.

You'll need to see the movie to judge it's value as a work of art, but this movie goes a long way toward telling the untold (or rather unlistened-to) story of what happened and is happening in Cuba.",1151366400,183,2127,4.743869209809264
2798559,5,B000OPO61U,"The Lost City is not a great film. Still, it is a four and a half star production.  The strength of Andy Garcia's story is how he successfully reveals the gullibility of the Cuba's affluent ""useful idiots.""  Fico's family is caught right in the middle of this historic challenge to Cuba's political structure.  Some of its members intelligently advocate evolution over revolution.  Others, regrettably, believe in the violent overthrow of the government.  Governments have come and gone throughout the island's history?  Why should it be any different with Fidel Castro's guerrillas?  Are they really something special?  Cubans party and enjoy themselves oblivious to the doom soon awaiting them.  In many respects, we are reminded of the frog who is unaware that he is being slowly boiled alive.

The Cuban people needed to remove dictator Fulgencio Batista from power.  This is beyond dispute.  But how was this goal to be accomplished?  At what cost?  Who would replace him?  Is there a chance the nation could be jumping out of the proverbial frying pan and into the fire?  Such questions cannot be ignored by mature adults.  Alas, Cuba's pseudo educated childlike creatures preferred to live in an imaginary world of make believe.  Castro did not have the slightest interest in promoting democratic values.  He is, first, last, and foremost, a Marxist thug.  And make no mistake about it.  This was abundantly clear for anyone who possessed a lick of sense and a historical perspective.  ""In 1958 Cuba had a higher per-capita income than Austria and Japan. Cuban industrial workers had the 8th highest wages in the world,"" says writer Humberto Fontova.  Today, Cuba is an economic basket case.  This never had to happen.
