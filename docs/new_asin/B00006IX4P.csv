7969822,4,B00006IX4P,Fun french romp about two musicions who need someone to make a recording. Christopher Lambert (very young here)falls for a studio rep. Catherine and things get a little complicated but its all in the game. Good movie to practice your french. It's like a beach read romance but with talent and chemistry.,1141084800,5,303,4.846153846153846
