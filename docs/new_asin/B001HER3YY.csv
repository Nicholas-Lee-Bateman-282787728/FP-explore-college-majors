8326494,1,B001HER3YY,"While she teaches much of what you need to know to do OK on this song, her teaching style was the most annoying experience I've had in this form of lesson delivery. This is not a professionally produced product and she should take cues from how others present - teach it once and if we want to see/hear it again and again and again, we can rewind. The DVD is difficult to navigate and the early lessions where she goes into excrutiating detail on how to play a D chord, were almost unbearable. Don't be fooled by the Title that appears to include Nancy Wilson (look for her DVD)...it doesn't.",1266364800,3,592,4.390909090909091
