3598885,4,B001GCUO0W,"Wow,lots of different opinions concerning this film and while both make some good points overall you have to hand it to them, the updated ""Wolfman"" finishes in flying colors. It may not have ""Oscar"" written on it, but it was every bit the film I was anticipating. I think allot of folks out there get so amped up and excited that the re-make will out do the original they forget...""it's a re-make"" and are dissappointed somehow that it wasn't made differently,or enough to really ""wow"" them. They updated the story a tad and of course...the visual effects were a large improvemnt over  the ""old school"" film disolve techniques of the 1940's. It was as dark and moody as I knew it would be and it had all the gore one could want or expect. Some folks just can't be satisfied and enjoy a film for what it is, ""some good entertainment"".Why does every film have to be some kind of life changing experience, and what good is it to ""nit pick"" over every mundane detail?Lots of other films out there(even Oscar winners and contenders) have plenty of flaws. This one was just an easy target and there are some out there who just do the thorough nit pick review routine and miss everything else the film has to offer. I've always loved werewolf flicks(and seen my share of really bad ones)and while this is a diferent film in comparrision to ""An American Werewolf in London"" or the original ""Howling"",it has it's place in the werewolf universe. It was slightly predicatable,but not in a horrible way as it doesn't really hurt the film. A great cast head by Anthony Hopkins, Benicio Del Toro and of course,the multi talented Hugo Weaving and directed by ex ILM man Joe Johnston. What more could one want?The visual effects were top notch and it had a story line that didn't stall or bore you. It's a great piece of entertainment and a good film to go up there amongst the best of werewolf movies and believe me...there aren't many and this one goes in the top three.",1261094400,,1956,4.556818181818182

The unrated version is better than the theatrical version.  This movie pays homage to the original with Lon Chaney in several ways, including a spinning globe at the start just like the old Universal movies. (Only in the unrated version, cut from the theatrical release.)

I sat there watching the movie in my room (no one will watch these kind of movies with me except my Dog who has slept through every movie except for Solomon Kane, totally awesome movie) wondering when it was going to get good and unfortunately it didn't, half the time I couldn't even see what the heck was going on!

It's far from captivating, no suspense or intrigue, boring plot, crap acting, and the CGI in this movie is just plain terrible. The werewolves look like hairy chipmunks or squirrels on a bad hair day. Only the beauty of Emily Blunt provides any faint hope, even then that only goes so far.

Excellent performances by the rest of the cast as well.  The, ""dark shadowy graveyard swathed in chilling mist,"" type of feel is sustained brilliantly here providing the perfect palette for a richly 19th century vintage horror.

3599132,4,B001GCUO0W,"A unapologetically moody Universal monster movie. It's cold, clammy and grey atmosphere that earned it a boring reputation actually worked quite well for me when opposed to the vivid ferocity and exotic awakening Lawerence experiences becomig the Wolfman.

It's too fast and too slow in the wrong and right places, so I can see the frustration some people felt when they expected a deep fulfilling thriller of a Wolfman story, but to me this Wolfman excels in what it did not say or do.

As a noble and a problem child Lawerence has been restrained and repressed his whole life and finds both freedom and restriction as a contracted theater actor, so returning home to England is almost as much a relief as it is a cathartic purging of his past. The curse of the Wolfman proves to be connected to more than he realizes however when his first encounter with the beast leaves him with feverish hallcinations and primal urges he is sure are his psychosis acting up.

All in all understandbly not for everyone, but without turning every great story into an eight part series so every idea or twist can be explored, this movie was a solid reinvigoration of the Wolfman story, and it's refreshing, even if it bites sometimes.",1480377600,3,1219,4.713615023474178

The film is worth it if for no other reason than to watch the learned doctors of their day gather for a scientific presentation on delusional lycanthropy on a full moon at an insane asylum, only to have it all become real as their subject turns into a werewolf before their horrified gazes. That and the climactic wolf fight ending are well worth your time if you are a fan of classic horror movies. There's also a wonderful cameo by Geraldine Chaplin as the gypsy healer/seer.

3599319,4,B001GCUO0W,"I watched The Wolfman (2010) for the first time recently and without having seen the original I loved it. It's got very average reviews but when I saw a second hand DVD for $2 (extended director's cut) I took the plunge. And quite possibly the best $2 I have ever spent. Victorian era England movies rope me in every time and this movie looks so beautiful from the manor to the misty hilltops. Yes, it's a bit disjointed but I appreciated that in a ""this is what you're getting folks, like it or lump it up"" sort of way.

 Emily Blunt was excellent as was Hugo Weaving as Abberline but I don't have much time for Benicio Del Toro. I've only ever liked him in Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas and he has a Neanderthal missing link type appearance anyway so might've been better going with a less animalistic looking guy. I also thought Anthony Hopkins was on auto pilot for most of it but loved that scene in the manor when he passes Blunt on the stairs and he just keeps staring at her without saying a word. I felt there were a few little odd humorous scenes in there that worked really well.

 The gore was welcome given I expected it to be pretty sanitised and I felt the movie had quite a bit of charm and went to bed with a smile on my face. Good show old chaps.

If you are a Universal Monsters fan, then you will enjoy this picture.  The Wolfman transformation and action scenes were priceless.  Great jobs by Rick Baker for makeup (and did you see his cameo!?) and Danny Elfman and Conrad Pope for music.  SOOO love seeing the blueray again and again.

It is 1891 in England. A man's brother disappears and his fiance requests him (Tororo) to come and help find him. The Tororo character had spent a year in an insane asylum, then he became an actor. Tororo finds his father who tells him he is too late; his brother's body was found yesterday. Tororo looks at the body. It is mostly a skeleton, much of his flesh has been ripped off.
His father is rather strange, distant, unfeeling. He has a Seik as a servant and the Seik has silver bullets.
People say that others have been similarly killed either by a wild beast, a lunatic, or an unnatural man. Tororo decides to stay to find out who killed his brother. He gets bitten by the beast. Town folks say ""Once one is bitten, there is no help; except one can be released by someone who loves him.""
Tororo recovers from his attack in an unnatural way.",1456617600,2,1066,4.282178217821782

Even still, they could've just as easily had stuff happening off stage, Dracula used it all the time and is still a classic.

3599682,4,B001GCUO0W,"The Wolfman. It is a story steeped in history and mythology originating through various sources throughout Ancient and Medieval era in Europe. The idea of a werewolf is a creative manifestation of man's fears in the ""unknown beasts"" that live in the wild. The idea of random attacks committed by wildlife in which man has no control over is a frightening concept. Though if one were to be able to assign blame to an individual then any said attacks would be easier to fathom as a man can be controlled.

In this reinterpretation of the classic Universal film ""The Wolfman"", the title character is played by Benicio del Toro. His character's name is Lawrence Talbot and he is called home to Talbot Hall in the wake of his brother's murder. We are introduced to characters such as Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins), Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt) and Inspector Aberline (Hugo Weaving). This tale incorporates classic themes such as the ties that a person keeps with their ""home"", how childhood trauma affects a person throughout their life and the unresolved emotional deficiencies between father and son.

It is the latter theme that is most prevalent in this film. Within a modern culture males are discouraged from expressing themselves emotionally in any manner other than through anger. Which is all well and good in a wartime situation or in getting things done necessary to a person's way of life. Though it has it's purpose this type of acceptable emotional expression has profound effects on a person's mind. It has the potential to disrupt and cause ripples through a person's life and in the case of this film; it drives a wedge between father and son. Lawrence Talbot goes to the United States of America and becomes an actor. While becoming an actor he is able to mask childhood trauma by learning how to become other people, he is also able to learn how to emotionally express himself. This runs counter to Sir John Talbot who expresses nothing but anger, resentment and frustration. Lawrence is even called weak by his father for showing emotion.

This message is not exclusive to film. This a dynamic that exists in all communities, regions and faiths. It affects all who come into contact and the only way to work through it is to embrace the whole of a person. This includes what is described as masculine, feminine and everything in between. After all one whole is always better than one part.

3599686,5,B001GCUO0W,"Love this movie.  Many don't like it, but sometimes it's cool to be the only person who loves something unique.  It def added so much more to the original Lon Cheney Jr film.  The character of Francis Aberline I'm not sure was a necessary addition to the storyline, esp since he is just a copy of Frederick Abberline from Johnny Depp's ""From Hell,"" clearly, since Lawrence mentions the Ripper case to Aberline.  The DVD arrived in the mail in perfect condition, so no complaints whatsoever there.  I'm also a fan of Anthony Hopkins and Emily Blunt, and thought they added much to the story, Emily playing Gwen Conliffe's character quite exceptionally well.  I was stoked to find out that Rick Baker, the special makeup effects guru known for ""An American Werewolf in London"" finally got his dream-come-true by working on this film since the original Wolf Man is what inspired him to get into makeup design.  There is a scene that is def an homage to ""American Werewolf"" when the omnibus falls over like in the Piccadilly Massacre, except the werewolf didn't jump into the bus to kill people.  The deleted scenes are such a treat, I was afraid the Unrated Version wouldn't have the deleted train scene with Max von Sydow just to be pleasantly surprised that it was included.  The silver wolf cane was pretty significant in the original film so I'm glad that it was included somewhere.  My favorite scene must be when Lawrence transforms into the Wolfman in front of all the doctors in the asylum and gets his vengeance on his sadistic doctor.  Hope this isn't a spoiler, but I love seeing Anthony Hopkins play a villain, esp when he played Hannibal Lecter, so this was a real treat for Hopkins fans.  I thought the effects were pretty good, and I know werewolf fans probably think this Wolfman isn't what they wanted since we've come a long way with showing werewolves running around on all fours, like in ""American Werewolf,"" but I thought this one looked pretty good trying to remain true to Lon Cheney Jr.'s original look, and he technically did run on all fours in the London sequence.  I believe they might be making another Wolfman movie, but I'm content with this one.  Benicio del Toro was a die-hard Wolf Man fan and had been aching to play Larry Talbot for years, and he kinda looks like Cheney Jr., so I'm actually content.",1438214400,,2333,4.658536585365853

The movie gets crazy when the werewolf fight goes down and he finds oit who killed his brother (his dad) as well as killed his mother. So the townspeople lock him up cuz they think he is the monster.

 To me this is one of the greatest werewolf pictures ever filmed bar none! I thought the cast was uniformly fine. It had wonderful atmosphere and dread and the music score was absolutely great for this kind of scary film. Danny Elfman wrote the score and it is one of his best.
  I have seen all the great werewolf movies which include, '"" The Werewolf of London"", "" The Wolfman""(1941), "" I was a Teenage Werewolf"" (1957, Michael Landon debut), "" The Howling"", "" An American Werewolf of London"", And last but not least ""Silver Bullet"". And I put this version of "" The Wolfman right on top with this list. Even better than most of them!
 Only one slight spoiler- where he is tied to the chair and the moon starts to appear and he roars "" I will kill all of you, all of you"" is beyond scary as he than starts to change into a horrific fiend. Just gruesome. And everybody tries to escape. What a scene! End of spoiler.

3599910,5,B001GCUO0W,"First off, I'm going to say that if you loved the classic horror film ""The Wolfman,"" starring Lon Chaney Jr., you will find that this movie does its best to respect the aura and mood that the Universal film created that has lasted the test of time. It is a great film that was unfortunately criticized by those who want reused schlock and hold contempt for Gothic horror. Please set their criticisms aside, and give this movie a chance. It's a great film and it really does the Wolfman justice.

Directed by Joe Johnston, the story revolves around Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro), an American stage actor who returns to England to find that his missing brother Ben has been killed. His father Sir John Talbot (the amazing Anthony Hopkins) has a strained relationship with his son, and makes every effort to dissuade him from searching for the truth in fear of losing him as well, even more so amid the strange panic in their town surrounding unexplained deaths.

As rumors of a terrible beast killing others around Blackmoor come to Talbot's attention, he seeks out the truth with even more vigor, resulting in himself being attacked and bitten by the mysterious creature at a Gypsy camp. Thrown into this tragic tale of curses and monsters is determined Scotland Yard inspector Frances Aberline (Hugo Weaving), who suspects Talbot to be a murderer, and Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt), who also seeks the truth of what killed her fiancee.

Expect dark, moody scenes, tragic twists, and gory, monstrous turns in this one. Del Toro does a fine job as Talbot and Hopkins delivers well as his estranged dad. The music is superb, done by Danny Elfman, and the special effects makeup by legend Rick Baker is on-point and makes us horror fans proud to see a real movie monster again.

I saw this on its opening weekend in 2010, and since then I've said it is one of my favorites of all time. I like the original but this film really reintroduced the Wolfman to a new generation even if the timing and reception wasn't too favorable. Films like this fall victim to trends, and because of its reinvented classic horror mood, a lot of folks skipped it because of the jump scares and handi-cam scary movies presented today. I say watch it and you'll find yourself howling with approval for The,Wolfman.",1418688000,3,2291,4.72

Although not it's parent the original Wolfman with Lon Chaney Jr. in the tile role, it is faithful to the original intent and story line. There is no sex or foul language, and the special effects are really good, but I must admit although, the special effects are good they are still no match for the original movie ""the Howling"", which in my humble opinion had the best werewolf change sequence I ever saw in a film. So it is for this reason that the movie received 4 stars instead of five. None the less, the movie is still very good. I would caution parents of younger children though, that even in this day and age, that there are still some intense horror scenes within this film, that could have a bad effect on certain children.

3600006,4,B001GCUO0W,"The Unrated version is sooo much better than the theatrical version in my opinion. Whereas I would've rated the theatrical version 3-stars, the unrated gets a 4.5. Key reason is because the theatrical version seemed to really try to make it suspenseful, but everything was always very predictable & not enough action. For the unrated version, it's just like watching a supernatural action movie with all the gore you'd expect a werewolf to be able to do- but it's not too over the top either. Forget about suspense, it's just a very exciting & awesome film. It also has the best effects & design of a werewolf/wolfman in any movie EVER.

I'm a big fan of werewolves, yet I felt they were never done justice until this film & Underworld: Rise of the Lycans. The other Underworlds' were great, but Lucian was the only one done any justice. All the others were mindless beasts and died from gunshots too easy, flopping to the ground dead (real life bears don't even die that easy) and the masks didn't have realistic movement. Van Helsing was great, but the design a bit too cartoonish at times- so was the script. Silverbullet & Wolf are classics for me, but just outdated.

Overall, The Wolfman UNRATED Director's Cut & Underworld: Rise of the Lycans, are the best werewolf movies of all time for me.",1412726400,,1299,4.668122270742358
3600007,4,B001GCUO0W,"It is so difficult to make a film that its a miracle that they ever get made. The Wolfman was unfortunately plagued with production problems from the beginning; the original director jumping ship halfway through, the producers not sure what kind of movie it wanted to make, various re-writes, etc.. Director Joe Johnston was called in the 11th hour to salvage the mess and turned out a pretty decent throwback of a monster movie. While you may not consider it the greatest in its own genre I found it to be a welcomed addition to the werewolf canon. Cinematography and set design really evoked the mood of Victorian Gothic. The cast are all older, seasoned actors who bring gravitas to the characters instead of a bunch of 20-somethings which most horror-films cast (Emily Blunt was 27, but she can act!) , a brooding Danny Elfman score, and make-up effects by master monster maker Rick Baker who created a great old-school Wolman!

The Directors Cut adds some 17 minutes of footage that adds some nice character development and rounds them out more, especially in regards to the characters of Emily Blunt and Anthony Hopkins (and also features a classy cameo by Max von Sydow!)While Del Toro (a fine actor) is not a patch on Lon Chaney Jr., he does put his own stamp on the character of Lawrence Talbot. In whole this was a honorable re-imagining of Universal's 1941 classic, blending the old and the new and  taking a classic gothic character and updating him for modern audiences. I also found the climax of the film to be a nod to another Universal werewolf film, 1935's  Werewolf of London starring Henry Hull.  It is does have its share of bloody scenes (albeit fleeting), but if you appreciate a classy, old-school style gothic monster movie, The Wolfman delivers!

3600111,2,B001GCUO0W,"I saw this movie at home on dvd hoping that it would have some sort of entertainment value that I could get into.  I really tried to give this movie a chance, having chron and red wine ready.  Even with that and the best food, this movie is still to unwatchable.  Its too meandering, slow paced, dull, laid back and completely wastes what is a decent performance by Benicio Del Toro.  If you are interested in watching the movie and haven't seen it, then maybe don't read on as I describe what happens in the movie.

The movie is horror remake of the original wolfman, done in a 18th century European Gothic style type of look.  The movie has Benicio Del Toro, Anthony Hopkins and the bad guy from the first Matrix.  From the start, we the audience know that Del Toro is the wolfman, perpetrating the murders done in the movie, but watching the characters try to solve the murders is no fun at all.

We are treated to a couple of fast paced scenes where the wolfman rampages the town a couple of times, climbs some buildings and then scurries off into the woods.  Every time, after being the wolfman, Del Toro wakes up, confused and must find his way back home; essentially, any scene like this is a takeoff from American werewolf in London, which is not a problem, just something I'm pointing out.

The set pieces with the wolfman tearing amok are the only fast paced scenes, with the rest of the movie playing like a very, very dull murder mystery.  The movie kept me slightly interested because of Del Toro and Anthony Hopkins.  They both have subtle performances that draw you into the horror atmosphere they create.  I can sense that they both have an appreciation for horror films.  Also, the visuals look interesting, we get that creepy feeling of time long gone, but again its all sort of wasted by the lack of pacing in the movie and lack of enough interesting elements.

If this movie didn't really pique your interest, then it might not be worth your time for a viewing.  If so, maybe give it a try, especially if you like horror, the wolfman or any type of movie that is reminiscent of classic horror hollywood movies.  I liked the man stars, the look and the overall art direction, I just wished they had ramped up the action a little.",1402185600,,2248,4.470588235294118

I still give this movie a 5star rating. I'm hopeing for a sequel.oh yes , the werewolf design is perfect 10, great job mr. baker.",1388707200,,848,3.9941176470588236

3600179,4,B001GCUO0W,"I don't understand why this movie got such bad reviews.  I grew up with the classic Universal Monsters on local late Saturday night Chiller Theater.  To try and update it was a risky task indeed.  I thought all the actors were outstanding, considering they were doing a monster move, and a werewolf one at that.

""SPOILER ALERT"":

The only thing that held this from being a five star classic was the father-son werewolf vs. werewolf scene.  That was pretty bad, I grant you that.  I cannot condemn an entire movie for one bad plot line/scene.

Other than that, this is now my favorite Halloween movie. Thrills and chills abound.  Excellent lighting, mood, and special effects.  Also, if one pays attention, and knows all the old moves (including the Hammer film), their are nods to those films which I took great delight in.

Unfortunately since this movie didn't do good business, they likely won't update anymore classic monster movies, and that's a shame.  This film was lots, and lots of fun for me.

3600193,3,B001GCUO0W,"Full disclosure: I did not purchase this through Amazon.  I eagerly anticipated this release, hoping to add it to my Halloween watch list, and though I applaud the effort, unfortunately I can't recommend buying it.  I must say that the film was not all bad.  First, the positives: the production designers did an incredible job of recreating late 19th century Britain, and the dark atmosphere has only rarely been equaled in film.  The A/V quality of this 16x9 transfer is top notch.  Nor can I fault the actors, all of whom were capable.

Now the negatives: this project and its cast/crew were saddled with a first time director and screenwriter, and it shows.  Painfully.  Stilted dialogue, a plot that borders on incoherence, the usual tired romantic tropes to draw the ladies to the theaters...they're all here.  Which is too bad, because the film had real potential, and does deliver on some level.  I don't think that ""The Wolfman"" is bad, per se, just exceedingly mediocre.  If you really must watch the movie, I suggest renting or borrowing it first, to make sure you like it.  By the way, don't bother viewing the ""Unrated Director's Cut,"" which is even more disappointing to watch than the theatrical version.

Favorite quote: none.  Listening to the dialogue in this movie was like watching paint dry.",1380240000,2,1312,4.877828054298643
3600194,5,B001GCUO0W,I still watch the original Wolfman every Holloween. This version has all the eerie atmosphere of the original plus great pathos. I'm always impressed with Anthony Hopkin's propensity for depicting madness. I was not disappointed.,1379894400,,229,5.571428571428571
3600195,4,B001GCUO0W,I like the acting and plot the whole works it was a great movie. I do think the werewolf could have been done a little better. I mean we have great cgi now people.,1378857600,,163,3.823529411764706
3600196,3,B001GCUO0W,"The Wolfman, I was always curious about watching this movie after seeing the commercials and trailers for it. If anyone looked like he could be a werewolf in disguise, Benicio Del Toro would be it.

The problem with this movie is that, it doesn't really grip you, but you could tell it's really trying hard to get you invested. Though Benicio did an admirable job trying to play the nice guy role, he just looks like too much of a creeper to really be a nice guy. There's just something about his look that always makes you feel like he's secretly a psychopath.

Also, the love between him and the female love interest felt very... weird. I guess I'm just one of those folks that would be very creeped out if my love started dating my brother. No sir I don't like it!

There were a few other things I didn't like in this movie, namely, there were just way too many time lapse segments. There were so many time lapse from daylight to nightime and back again, that it felt like several months had passed. I also didn't understand why the one character didn't turn into a werewolf when they stared into the moon.

The effects were interesting, and the Wolfman costume definitely looked like an homage to the original. I was entertained by the action and the characters, but I can't say that I would recommend watching this movie. It's probably fine to watch on a Halloween night, but don't expect anything special from this flick.",1378771200,2,1427,4.51937984496124
3600197,4,B001GCUO0W,"The Wolfman, based on the 1941 classic, centers on Lawrence Talbot, the brother of Ben Talbot who is supposedly killed by a wolf-like monster, and marks the return of Lawrence to Blackmoor. His father, Sir John Talbot is also there, awaiting Lawrence's arrival, and knows a secret that will change Lawrence forever. Lawrence finds out that this monster is real, and that he's running out of time, for he soon will become the very thing he wishes to destroy.

Directed by Joe Johnston (Hidalgo, Captain America: The First Avenger) helms the seat for this intense thriller, and brings a big, fun blockbuster look to the reimagined classic. I'm dumbfounded though, at how many poor reviews there are for this movie, especially when it was actually very, very good. I will say, though, the 17-minutes added to the Director's Cut did make a considerable and well-needed difference. The theatrical version was very flawed and more of just a fun, ridiculous horror gore-fest, but the extended version added Max Von Sydow's cameo, and the introduction of the silver cane, which was great. The script, written by David Self and Andrew Kevin Walker was not great, but good enough that it made a memorable experience that shines with old-fashioned scares and some good dialogue from Hugo Weaving's Inspector role, and Anthony Hopkins' as well. The acting was very good, especially Benicio Del Toro who played Lawrence Talbot, a man haunted by visions of his mother who died when he was just a boy. Who left home, hoping to leave his demons behind. The visual effects were great, as was the make-up; the re-creation of London was just phenomenal, and the dark, gloomy setting was superb, definitely adding to the atmosphere. Then, Danny Elfman's haunting score was great as well, helping build the tension and terror that would soon befall everyone Talbot would encounter.

Overall, The Wolfman was a fun, wildly entertaining thrill-ride that deserves better recognition. I really don't get why so many people didn't like it, although, I can see the dislike towards the amount of gore; it was pretty extensive.",1378252800,,2098,5.008595988538682

3600230,4,B001GCUO0W,"The Wolfman is yet another remake of the old werewolf story.  This one has some great camera work that heightens the suspense and eeriness of the scenes.  The Danny Elfman also adds a great deal.  The movie also has some fine special effects, but to its credit, it does not make or break the movie and the movie is not overly dependent on them.  Instead the strength of the story and the complexity of the characters are the main driving point of the film, as it should be.

Anthony Hopkins is stupendous (is he ever anything less) as the patriarch of the cursed Tolbert family.  He brings cynicism, gravitas and credibility to the father, whom you loath, but pity all the same.  Emily Blunt is likewise excellent as the fiance of the brother who was just recently murdered by the wolf.  She seems a strong woman but later shows herself to be a bit of a patron saint for lost causes.  Benicio Del Toro, in my view, gives the weakest performance, as the son cursed with lycanthropy.  He fails to convey the complexity, depth, and contradictions of the man who is an artist, faithful son, and man with a tortured past.  He seems to speak with the same monotone throughout the film, and for this reason, I must give the Wolfman only four stars rather than five.

This was a good view with lots of scary moments and twists and turns a plenty, but the weak performance of Del Toro makes this film less than top drawer.",1374192000,,1413,4.455252918287938

3600232,4,B001GCUO0W,"No doubt about the fact that this is a much classier production than Lon Chaney, Jr. ever knew when he was doing the quick change into a Wolf. No only is it in color, but the scenery and effects are incomparably better than in juniors time. So, too, is the name of Hopkins for the Marquee; that is clearly in the A class. As to the film, itself, it is entertaining, has a good villain to dislike, and a bit of human pathos in the father-son relationship; however, somewhere along the line the Director (or someone in charge) let a good deal of the tension, fear and just  plain pizzazz out. That leaves us with a good to excellent cast, in the right kind of scenery, with rather flattened emotional tone. As a consequence, we get a watchable film but not a suspenseful one. I liked it and can recommend it for decent evening watching as a story of father and sons, love and hate; I cannot recommend it as a movie that will ring the suspense bells and have you on the edge of your seat.",1371427200,,985,4.267379679144385

3600237,3,B001GCUO0W,"Actually this film gets a 10 for sets, atmosphere and scenery. All were superb. The acting is right on par but nothing to write home about. I admit I am not much of a werewolf kind of person, I go for vampires a little more. There were some very great creeps and crawls in this one here and there, but the end (I won't give it away) was rather hokey and predictable as was much of the story. All in all there isn't much of any suprises here, its about what you would expect. If the film was as good as the theatrical trailer led me to believe I would have been pretty blown away. As is that was the best thing about this film, the trailers. So again decent acting, excellent mood and atmosphere, great period detail and the wolfman himself was pretty creepy and slightly silly at the same time",1367884800,,793,4.223684210526316
3600238,4,B001GCUO0W,"The interest of the film is not the legend about werewolves. It is not the connection of these mythical animals with the gypsies who are supposed to come from India where very old religions were based on bloody rituals of all types from human sacrifice to human torturing and the use of the blood and various organs of the appointed volunteers for religious purposes. The Bon religion was one of these up in the Himalayas that was recuperated by Buddhism when it arrived in Tibet, but you had the same type of religions in India per se before Hinduism even if most of their rites seem to have disappeared, although I have come across the practice of ""giving the water"" to the widows of a king who has just died, meaning the widows, wives or concubines, had to drink the poison that would put them to death, and it was still common in the fifth century and naturally evoked by some pilgrims in Sigiriya, Sri Lanka, still in the 9th century. And torturing was a very common practice and it was fantasized by Indian Jones in all possible ways.

But the film is really interesting because it is situated at the end of the 19th century in England, at the end of the Victorian era. They wanted to be scientific and thus the doctors considered werewolves did not exist and were only the delusion of a sick person who deserved treatment, and then they turned torturers with treatments like full immersion in a bathtub and electric shocks and all types of injections. And such treatments, plus the modern practice of lobotomy, were still practiced in the USA and some other civilized and developed countries thirty years ago, and are still advocated by some doctors for gay people for one example, still in western countries, like the USA, particularly some states like Utah and organization like the Mormons.

The film then sets the case of a werewolf inside his family and in spite of all the care he takes to tie himself up during the full moon night, in a way or another, he gets trapped out and he starts with killing his wife and twenty or twenty-five years later he kills one of his sons, the one who had stayed on the estate, and then when the second son arrives for the funeral he attacks him and turns him into a werewolf in his turn and then you can imagine the oedipal situation created by these events. And all that in one provincial 18th century mansion with the furniture and all the props and decoration from this time and the phenomenally intricate setting and disposition inside and outside.

But that is all. Then the film is carried by the action, the rhythm of it, the simple but yet complicated hunt by the police, the sentimental involvement of the first brother's girlfriend with the second brother even when he is turned into a werewolf which leads to a sentimental and romantic ending, with a punchline because one cop managed to get scratched by the last werewolf of this family, the second son, the prodigal son as his father calls him, since he is the son who moved out, to New York mind you, to have a carrier on theatrical stages, playing Shakespeare, Hamlet and Richard III, are we told. The werewolf is migrating out of the aristocratic family and to London.

That was the come back of the werewolf to the screen before Anne Rice captured the myth and turned her werewolves into adorable justice makers and civil beings who would never hurt anyone who does not deserve it. In this film the werewolf is nothing but a plain killer. Too bad! He could have been a darling of a monster, since we all like blood, but with a smile and a spoonful of sugar, califragilisticexpialidocious, though we should write it with a capital K at the beginning because Kali is from India and known as the black god of time and death, the lord of death, the bloody consort of Shiva, the destroyer and the transformer, a bloody god too, and since both are as much male as they are female, they can embody and impersonate any kind of loving relation, and they live on their sexual lust just as much as they do on their blood lust.

The film is not elaborating on this subject in spite of the presence of a Hindu character in the house. The film is just satisfying the strong desire any audience in this global world is experiencing for the appealing werewolves that can purr in your lap if you know how to tame them.

3600239,2,B001GCUO0W,I am so surprised that Anthony Hopkins would even want to be associated with this film!  It was horrible! The only entertainment quality was that it helped me go to sleep.,1367452800,,171,4.516129032258065
3600250,3,B001GCUO0W,"One of my recent late-night movies was ""Wolfman"" (Unrated Director's Cut) starring Benicio Del Torro and Anthony Hopkins. The movie was exceptionally well done and had many of the marks of an Academy Award Winner. The setting was marvelous and appeared authentic in every way. Added to that was exceptionally good photography. Everything had a dark and dreary cast to it with a cloudy sky and a lot of ground fog. Most of the movie took place at night, I might add, and the total setting was creepy, to say the least. A lot of emphasis was placed on the Moon, too much in my opinion. It was necessary, but overdone. The acting was excellent, by the entire cast. All of this is to the good, but I didn't care for the movie at all.

Let me explain a bit about my own background, In High School, I became a movie buff and I've carried that hobby with me off and on for the rest of my life. One thing that I've always had trouble with right from the beginning was horror stories, most commonly associated with Frankenstein, Dracula, Werewolves and things of that sort. It just came across as nonsense no matter how well done it might have been and there was no way for me to lapse into enough belief to relax and enjoy the story. Why stuff like this is regarded as fine fictional art is beyond my understanding and I can only view it as unmitigated rubbish. Once the story drifts into this kind of creepy supernatural, my interest just dissipates and the more the director tries to make it seem real, the less I like it. Okay, I'm very highly educated in the sciences and I just can't take this kind of drivel. It relies heavily on ignorance and superstition. It isn't the least bit fun to watch. All the scary monsters come across as ludicrous, and are the most poorly done part of this movie, I might add.

If you like this type of horror movie, then you might greatly appreciate this film in that it is exceptionally well produced, although I found the monsters to be really corny and substandard relative to the rest of the movie. Now, since I'm supplying a review and have to rate the film, what kind of rating do I list? Well, based on the setting, acting and filming, obviously this movie would be five stars. If you like this type of movie and can somehow stomach the story, take that as a rating. On the other hand, if you throw in the ridiculous monsters and the incredulous story, my rating could get no higher than three stars and I'm struggling with that.

3600255,4,B001GCUO0W,"What can one say that has not been said except that the viewing public did not embrace this fine film in 2010 for whatever reasons, and Universal Pictures was sadly disappointed in the film reception by critics and the public.  Comparisons to the original film from 1941 with the great Lon Chaney, Jr. are inevitable.

However, this film has to be taken on its own merits.  There are several twists in the story which are different that the 1941 original.

Lawrence Talbot was given a very human persona by Lon Chaney, Jr. in 1941.  Benicio Del Toro in 2010 gave the character depth and a tragic history.  His performance was mesmerizing as the tortured soul of a man who lost his mother, his brother and in many ways his father, the mysterious Sir John.

Moving the location from Wales to England was a nice, Gothic touch.  Blackmoor Manor was truly a Gothic portrait with all its hidden secrets and deadly undertones.

Sir Anthony Hopkins is superb as Sir John Talbot, master of Blackmoor and the carrier of a deadly curse.  His facial expressions convey a volume of words, painful yet sinister.

Emily Blunt as Gwen Conliffe is a woman torn by the death of her love, Ben Talbot and her growing attachment to his brother, Lawrence.  All the while Sir John watches her closely as a hawk eyeing its prey.

Hugo Weaving as Chief Inspestor Frederick Abberline of Scotland Yard gave  another sterling performance as the man who had sought Jack the Ripper and was determined to find the ""man"" responsible for the Blackmoor savage murders.  The character was based on an actual person who was a police inspector.

I wish Art Malik's Singh, devoted servant to Sir John, had been given more screen time.  His character was one of the most interesting in the film which the deleted scenes section gave his history.

Max von Sydow had a brief cameo in the Director's cut which explains the walking cane with the silver wolf head which Lawrence has.  The cinematography by Shelly Johnson was outstanding, especially when Ben and Lawrence were children at Blackmoor.

It is a good remake of the original with its own atmospheric elements and twists. It is too bad that Benicio Del Toro will not continue in the franchise like Lon Chaney, Jr. did in the 40s films since Universal had decided to reboot the franchise with a different cast.",1363996800,,2326,4.71039603960396

3600302,4,B001GCUO0W,"To make a film like The Wolfman in 2011 is a big gamble on the part of Universal simply because the ""horror"" movie scene is dominated by the Underworld+Twilight kind of films.

That said it was important to have made this film and although questions may be raised about it's greatness, i doubt if we can or should question its necessity.

Some of the things I really liked about this film are:
+ Emily Blunt. She has a great magnetism and screen presence. She dominated every shot she was in. Highly impressed.
+ Benicio. Great charismatic actor doesn't disappoint as usual. Well cast as the ""prodigal son"".
+ Anthony Hopkins: Great performance and that too so late in his career when most people his age have trouble going to the bathroom he's a shoutin' and a screamin' like nobody's business.
+ Hugo Weaving: Agent Smith is now Inspector Francis. Everything else is the same except he's grown some massive mutton chops. He's copying me. Darn him!
+ Plot: The story was good. It was interesting enough and did a good job of adding new elements to the existing tale which is always important to take a classic story to a new century. The love tension between Del Toro and Blunt's characters is good. Reminiscent of ""An American Werewolf in London"".
+ Action/Suspense: Good. Enjoyable.
+ Cinematography and Sets: Very nice. Like classy Hammer Horror for the 2000s. Another great gamble paying off. The film is deliberately dark.

Director Joe Johnston has kind of disappointed me over his career. He started out strong doing visual effects for Empire and Raiders, and then ended up making the awesome Rocketeer and I even liked Hidalgo. I wasn't really a fan of Captain America for the overuse of digital effects and flat story, but I feel like this movie was just the right amount of effects and dialogue. Emily Blunt gets underused but is great when she's onscreen. Anthony Hopkins and Hugo Weaving are typical and predictable but solid. Benicio does a really good job as a lead which I always only ever saw him as a supporting actor or James Bond villain.

3600375,5,B001GCUO0W,"Ah the Wolfman.  What can you say about one of the marble collumns of the Horror genre.  Like his partners in blood Dracula and Frankenstein's Creature, our hairy antihero has had quite a long life.  From really well made horror movies like The Howling, An American Werewolf In London, and Wolf to really bad dreck like Skinwalkers and Van Helsing, his legacy continues to grow for generations.  Now, Universial Pictures has decided to go back and revamp (or I guess rehowl) the Wolfman for a whole new generation of movie goers and this is, by far, one of the better remakes.  It's elegant and classy Gothic horror that we saw back in the early 90s with Bram Stoker's Dracula and Mary Shelly's Frankenstein but with a lot more of the splashy red stuff and a lot of throat ripping.

When he gets word of his brother's murder, Lawrence Talbort (Benicio del Toro; Traffic, Things We Lost In the Fire) returns home to aid in the search for his murderer.  There, he receives a lukewarm welcome from his father John (Anthony Hopkins; The Silence of the Lambs, The Human Stain) whom he hasn't spoken to in years as well as meeting his brother's grieving fianc, Gwen (Emily Blunt; The Devil Wears Prada, Wind Chill).

One night, while near a gypsey camp, Lawrence is attacked by a huge wolf and left bitten.  Unfortunately for him, things are about to get a little hairy for now he is cursed to become exactly like the thing that attacked him.  But who is it?  As the murders continue to escalate, Lawrence is desperate to try and control the very beast that is trying to get out as well as dealing with a suspicious Scotland Yard agent (Hugo Weaving; The Matrix, The Adventures of Priscilla: Queen of the Desert) and the mutual feelings he has growing for Gwen.  But everything will come to light as the full moon rises.

This movie garnered a lot of undo negativity during its theatrical run and, as a result, the movie was a bomb.  But personally I loved it.  The movie was smart and moved at a well pace.  The performances were great (and I was doubting del Toro's performance beforehand but he quickly warmed me over).  It paid a loving tribute to the original and even improved on it.  I loved the whole part of the only way to end the curse had to come from someone who loves the afflicted.

Now, the disc comes with both the bombed Theatrical and the Director's Cut which expands the movie nearly 18 minutes and is, in my opinion, the one viewers needed to see in the first place. When will studios learn to listen to their gut instinct instead of a test audience?  The extra footage does move slower but the slower pace pays off as you get a better understanding of the characters as well as a MUCH richer story.  But all is not lost for the Wolfman as the studio is looking to green light another Wolfman movie. Will it pay off this next time around?  Who knows but remember that even a man who is pure of heart and says his prayers by candlelight can become a Wolf when the wolf bane blooms and the moon burns fat and bright.",1346803200,,3029,4.449275362318841

3600377,4,B001GCUO0W,"You know how this has to end and you can't look away even though you can't bear it at the same time. If you like neo-gothic horror in the vein of Bram Stoker's Dracula or The Woman in Black check out The Wolfman. It's a re-imagining of the 1941 Lon Chaney feature The Wolf Man, starting with the same DNA but tweaking it some. Benicio Del Toro stars as a young man who has made his fortune in the new world and returns to England to make peace with the father (Anthony Hopkins) who sent him to an insane asylum after a violent incident in his childhood. Emily Blunt is excellent as the woman who wants to save him. As others mention, there is a depiction of mental health treatments of the time period that is not for the faint of heart, not least of all because it is accurate. Beautiful cinematography, a fine Danny Elfman score, and some very good performances lift this effort above average for the genre. It also has some filler scenes that go on too long and one confrontation between two wolfmen that briefly takes a turn for the unintentionally hilarious. Those are minor quibbles for a movie that creates such a tense and somber mood. If you're looking for werewolf movies you could do a lot worse than this one.",1344643200,,1221,4.407079646017699

I thought the acting was superb, especially Benicio Del Toro (who played Lawrence Talbot). Del Toro is a phenomenal actor & he is oh so good looking.  The makeup by Rick Baker was absolutely magnificent. The scenery was great, scary, spooky & mysterious. The old castle, the moor, the moon shots all added to the doom & gloom theme of the movie. The fact that it was set in the 1800's era made it even more convincing than the 1941 original. Of course, Anthony Hopkins was his usual great self, in his role, as the father of the ill-fated Lawrence Talbot. It was a great re-make & in my opinion a lot more suspensful than the original.  If you like horror movies you will certainly enjoy this one. In the category of ""horror movie"" I give this one a 5 star review

3600379,3,B001GCUO0W,"The Wolfman is not the film that it could have been. It also was not as bad as people have been making it out to be. After seeing it, I did understand why alot of people hated it so much, and why it took forever to get production done, but I don't completely agree. The director was Joe Johnston, and while he may not be the best of filmmakers, I don't dislike his movies. I actually enjoyed Jurassic Park III, and Jumanji isn't a complete piece of crap either. But The Wolfman, like those two, just seems to have been done in his spare time, rather than his main focus. Even so, he could have done alot worse. Danny Elfman, the genius composer. His music is what really got under my skin and kept me interested in the story, because the cheap scares sure didn't. As odd as it may sound, that is what musical scores are made for. Pay attention next time you watch your favorite movie. Because if your favorite movies did not have the music they have, you would notice something special missing. But back to this movie. It's not the rotten movie that most of the critics on RT have made it out to be. I certainly noticed the flaws, but they did not spoil the experience for me.

It is true that the pacing is uneven, like most have said. I could probally count the amount of screen time (in minutes) the actual wolfman got, with my fingers. That would not have been such an issue if the other characters were equally as interesting. Sadly, not even Benicio del Toro was very compelling as the lead Lawrence Talbot. I wanted to feel sorrow for an innocent man that becomes a monster, but del Toro didn't make me. Emily Blunt and Hugo Weaving are their usual selves. Very good, and believable. My favorite performance hands down goes to Sir Anthony Hopkins. He was great. In fact, I think his performance is what saves this movie, and makes it a standout in its genre. I haven't been a fan of the horror genre lately, but this movie does stand out. The art design was great as well. The dark old English setting was very effective. And the special effects were on point. Even the bloodshed was great, and I'm not big on gore. Although it doesn't bother me. What this film does have is charisma. Every scene with the wolfman was exciting. Throughout the film I found myself slouching in my seat, even daydreaming a couple times about what they should have done with certain scenarios to make the movie better. But as soon as the slightest sign that the wolfman was on his way emerged, I immediately perked up. And in the end, that is what made this a fresh experience to me.

He had the dark, often evil look that suited the character and like the rest of the cast played his role perfectly. Hugo Weaving in particular I liked. Sure, he was doing his ""Mr Anderson"" thing, but to great effect here. Ther performances were quite intense, and that along with the lighting and music really built up the perfect gothic horror feel. It was very moody. On the downside as usual they got just a bit too carried away with the CGI. Not as much as you might think in the film like this, but some scenes would have been more intense if they had been more sublty handled rather than the often cartoonish, almost funny effect you often get with CGI. Also the end fight was so predictable: Possible spoiler here: the two wolves (Bencio and Hopkins) go at each other beginning with them running then jumping into each other for the ""Braveheart"" style impact start to the fight, then after endless back and forth the hero looks beat, but with one final move hurls his foe into a firey flailing death that predictably yet nicely ends with a violent decapitation.

Anthony Hopkins gives a stellar performance no matter what he's in and what really appealed to me was storyline and that there was some gore, but nothing like what I'm used to seeing in these movies (say like in Dog Soldiers -- another werewolf movie) which was refreshing.  I recommend!",1330473600,,576,4.693069306930693
3600407,3,B001GCUO0W,"This 2010 version of ""The Wolfman"" reminds me a lot of 1992's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula."" Both feature a classic monster, both take place in Great Britain during the Victorian era, both are stylistically similar, and both feature Anthony Hopkins in a major role.

Each is visually striking but, story-wise, ""Dracula"" wins the prize, which isn't to say that ""The Wolfman"" isn't worth watching. Hopkins, Benicio Del Toro (in the title role) and Emily Blunt are all fine in their roles, it's just that somehow the story and characters aren't all that engrossing. Maybe it's because Hopkins plays a distant eccentric patriarch and Del Toro plays his brooding loner son who hides behind Shakespearean characters. It's hard to relate to them or like them. Emily Blunt is likable enough, but she's never sufficiently fleshed out and her deep love for a certain character seems a bit unlikely and forced.

But, again, the film looks incredible and is worth viewing or owning for this reason alone. You get foggy moors, mysterious woods, gloomy estates, gypsy camps, dungeons and old London streets, all with werewolf attacks. Speaking of which, there's quite a bit of action and extreme gore interspersed throughout to keep things interesting. The music's good too.

The DVD features both the theatrical and unrated Director's cut, the latter of which is close to 20 minutes longer, which is the version I viewed.

GRADE: C+ or B- (although, visually, it's A+ all the way)",1329436800,3,1461,5.024793388429752
3600408,5,B001GCUO0W,"If you're a fan of the 1941 Lon Chaney movie The Wolf Man, I think you will be surprised by how much you like this version. It's more in the tradition of that classic film than later werewolf movies. Here, the werewolf is no teen heartthrob whose lycanthropy makes him more superhero than monster. Instead, as in 1941, the protagonist is cursed. He is the terrifying yet pitiful monster that ""even a man who is pure in heart"" can become when the autumn moon is bright.

As you know if you've seen the 1941 Wolf Man, the special effects of that film are very basic. Stop-motion was used to make Chaney grow hairier. In this version, the special effects are excellent, which makes the monster more terrifying, and the transition from man to beast look more painful and horrific.

If your kind of werewolf tends more toward the Twilight or Underworld version, however, you may still find this wolf ridiculous. He walks upright (as in 1941), in some scenes he wears a ragged vest after his transformation (as in 1941), and he doesn't fall in love with a sexy vampire. He's a pathetic, pitiful, wretched monster. The kind Hollywood used to make so well.",1327363200,,1148,4.622549019607843
3600409,4,B001GCUO0W,"And by titling it the way I did I am not saying the actor is bad. I do have a difficult time believing Benicio Del Toro though. I normally love him as an actor and when I first saw the announcement I thought he'd be a natural in the role immortalized by such greats as Lon Chaney Jr. and Paul Naschy (Spanish Wolfman films). Mr. Del Toro show little emotion throughout and seems to drift through the film as more of a spectator than a participant...If that makes any sense. He's not bad in it by any means. He just never really gets into the role. The rest of the cast is slightly above par.

What really makes this film work though is the thick, gothic ambiance that has been created through the set designs, cinematography and costumes. The mood is further carried along by Danny Elfman's classic-inspired score and Rick Baker's excellent gore effects...again proving to the world he is the best at his trade and that CGI will never be an acceptable substitute for in camera, down and dirty prosthetic effects. it's great to see in an era of complete computer rendered nonsense.

Sir Anthony Hopkins has established a reputation for being a tour-De-force in nearly every movie he has starred in. Now, Director Joe Johnston has taken the Andrew Walker/David Self novel and updated the original 1940's version. The movie is called "" The Wolfman "" and it's creation is a fantastic remake of Universal's original film. In 1940, it was featured actor Lon Chaney Jr. playing the cursed Lycanthrope, today it's Benicio Del Toro playing Lawrence Talbot. To bring an aura of superb acting, we have Sir Anthony Hopkins as Sir John Talbot. The story as originally created by the Greeks, later the Romans and perpetuated by the European Gypsies is about an ordinary man who is attacked by a throat-tearing Werewolf. A successful stage actor (benicio Del Toro) is summoned back to his ancestral home of Blackmore. Learning his brother was savagely mauled by a mysterious monster, Talbot seeks to discover the truth. Once home, he is followed by a Scotland Yard Inspector named Abberline (Hugo Weaving) to see if the family or the village is cursed. With distinguished actor Max Von Sydow in a cameo role, this movie is sure to please avid collectors. The movie itself is a wonderful tribute to the 1940's film and updates nearly all the aspects which gave it life. From the shadowy, dark forests, the torch carrying villagers to the neck ripping, howls of the shape-shifting creature, all combine to establish for all time, a true Classic for the modern age. Easily recommended to anyone seeking an action packed triller. *****",1324339200,,1631,4.930909090909091
3600411,2,B001GCUO0W,"There's a muddy, cracked, ancient path that winds and delves into the chasms of the the B - movie catalogue.  It's a risky, perilous road to take for any director, especially in this day an age.  It requires playing cat-and-mouse with cardinals sins of cinema without really knowing the position you're taking until it's too late.

To be sure, You won't be a critic's friend should you actually accomplish revitalizing this black sheep of a genre if there ever was one.  It's just too easy to sail over the heads of any practical audience as something unbelievably dim-witted; the tongue in cheek is completely wasted.

I really don't know what Joe Johnston had in mind while he was directing this twitchy, pseudo-grand rebirth of a classic B-grade creature feature.  It's a dichotomy of high brow surrealism and chuckle-inducing absurdities, to the point where the two often converge into something wholly ridiculous and only intriguing for the smallest of reasons.

Being a child of the new-age era, I have always fallen firmly in the party that favors the ""manwolf"" over the ""wolfman""; Think Remus Lupin, as opposed to Claude Rains.  This is where source material gets in the way of contemporary expecations:  when you take Johnston's wolfman out of the shadows, he/it simply isn't threatening enough to warrant thrills (something that this film is almost entirely devoid of, which is insulting).  When a character in Hogwarts is giving me more chills than Del Toro's depiction, something is going terribly wrong.

The excessive and undeniably exhilarating gore-fests that come up every half hour or so attempt to offset this, but it ultimately isn't enough.  One is just left with a hollow admiration for the crew to pay respect to the film's foundation which doesn't translate into the raw entertainment that these films live and die by.

Fortunately, effective atmosphere is timeless, and Johnston's team nails it quite well.  The stark, minimalist nature of the wilderness and countryside is perfect, easily making up for a dragging, uninspired middle that has Del Toro raging throughout an insane asylum and other urban environments.

It's a great cast, too, with Hopkins stealing the show and Del Toro showing his more versatile side.  As father and son, the two make for an enigmatic and intriguing duo, leaving Blunt and Weaving in the dust - not an easy task, by any means.  To their credit, the two pick up the slack easily enough, but their roles are just leverage for the relationship between the leads.

But for everything that goes right, there's the recurring issue of a real lack of foreboding and immediate danger that could have been achieved by following a man who's slave to a celestial object.  All the potential terror and chills are instead replaced with tacky, psychological humdrum and a pacing jerkier than a rat on a paint shaker.  It's a functional title in its own right, but the passion is absent, and the spirit is yet to be found.",1324166400,,2965,4.939516129032258

  'The Wolfman' is a remake of the 1941 horror 'classic' of the same name, starring Lon Chaney Jr. By changing the setting to Victorian England, the remake is light years ahead of the original in the set design department. I happened to love all the costumes, the locales where the film was shot as well as the Danny Elfman score which manages to add a lot more weight to the film, which suffers from the original paltry concept and some noxious re-imaginings found in this new revision.

  I simply fail to understand why people are drawn to the whole Wolfman concept in the first place. It has little basis in reality unless you're drawn to those stories of humans raised by apes in the jungle who are unable to throw off their primitive inclinations due to their unusual upbringing. Of course in those rare cases, the human being doesn't find himself transformed into a beast and then reverting to human form, whenever daylight finally breaks.

  As a myth, the Wolfman seems awfully simplistic. What does one learn after undergoing the 'Wolfman' experience in the movies? That men are capable of horrible violence when the thin veneer of civilization is swept away? So what!

  In a sense, the Wolfman character is a paganistic, pre-Christian representative of the Devil. Where the Devil is a beast in human form, the Wolfman is a human in a fake, beast-like form. Those viewers with unconscious aggressive wishes are vicariously drawn in part to the fake beast, who with his superhuman strength, rips peoples' heads off with a flick of his paw-like hand. Not only do they take delight in a character that can best be found conjured up in a five-year-old's nightmare, but also cheer just as loudly, when the fake creature meets its end at the hands of a superstitious, vengeful mob. The mob finally figures out a way to snuff out the life of this maniacal figure, who somehow emanates from a dream-like world. It's much more difficult coming to terms with devils such as the Nazis, whose evil had a human face and were not so easily defeated as the Wolfman is here.

  'The Wolfman' (the remake) changes the plot of the original 1941 film by introducing the idea that the Wolfman's father, Sir John Talbot, is actually a Wolfman himself and is responsible for the death of his son, Ben Talbot. Lawrence Talbot, now an American actor (having left England after the death of mother), initially returns to the family estate to investigate the disappearance of his brother, but soon learns that the brother has been murdered. Later, it's revealed that Sir John's faithful servant, Singh, has been keeping him locked up for years in the castle whenever the full moon appears, preventing the father from escaping and fomenting havoc throughout the countryside.

  The problem is that Sir John is an utterly, unlikable character who's depicted as not having one modicum of charm. He's such a churl that he doesn't hesitate in informing Lawrence that he's responsible for murdering his mother, his brother and also turning Lawrence into a werewolf as well. Instead of sticking up for the son (who's being hunted by a determined Scotland Yard Inspector as well as assorted meanies from the town), Sir John would rather (pardon the pun), throw his son to the wolves!

  Lawrence as the Wolfman has a similar problem. Unlike the Frankenstein monster or a modern version such as Terminator II, he's not what you would call, a 'conflicted' creature. The good side never comes out until maybe the end, when he realizes that it's Gwen (the woman who falls for both Ben and Lawrence), who he's about to rip apart, turning her into the expected umpteenth bloody mess. While Lawrence terrorizes both urban and rural parts of England, he's simply a killing machine, ripping all kinds of body parts from living human beings. All this becomes tiresome since we're praying that perhaps his human side might emerge and the Inspector will now have reasons in hesitating to do the creature in.

  Was anyone else bothered by the fact that the The Wolfman's demise is a foregone conclusion? I found it deflating that Maleva, the gypsy woman, informs Gwen that there's no cure for the Wolfman's curse. The best we can look forward to is that the Wolfman dies in the presence of someone who loves him. Once all that is brought out, the climax is utterly predictable and one realizes that 'The Wolfman' is a film with virtually no surprises.

  'The Wolfman' could have been a much more interesting film if it had some stakes (pardon the pun again), that you could bite your teeth into! How about a satire or critique on the Victorian age--the era in which the film is set in? In the end, 'The Wolfman' is all atmosphere. One must be content with admiring the attention to detail--yes, dig those illustrations on the front page of the newspaper that chronicles ""the monster's"" deeds, that the Inspector thrusts in Gwen's face when he visits her antique store! Very cool! As for the Wolfman story--unfortunately, that's something that's not very hard to forget, in a virtual instant.",1321488000,,5099,4.804347826086956
3600444,5,B001GCUO0W,"I approached this film with a lot of trepidition before watching it.  Knowing Rick Baker did the creature effects I thought he was going to resurrect his cheesy work from ""An American Werewolf In London"".  Secondly, screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker did a third rate job with ""Sleepy Hollow"" and I was expecting more of the same.  Thirdly I have a low tolerance for gore unless it's in the service of a good movie.  Lastly, I have an affinity for the 1941 film with Lon Chaney Jr.  Curt Siodmark's script for that film brilliantly and economically relates the sad fate of the doomed Larry Talbot.  Director Joe Johnson has allayed my fears, however.  His film not only lovingly references the original but there are some definite Hammer film influences here.  Walker's script not only expands the themes from the 1941 film but gives Lawrence Talbot a plausible backstory.  Benicio Del T oro is nothing short of brilliant as the ill-fated Talbot as is Anthony Hopkins as his estranged and enigmatic father.  I also liked the winsome Emily Blunt who is torn between saving the man but killing the beast inside the man.  It may take a strong stomache of sorts to sit through ""The Wolfman"" but you will be mesmerized by this retelling of this revered classic.",1320019200,9,1254,4.7592592592592595

3600447,4,B001GCUO0W,"I thought it was definitely a worthy remake of the Lon Chaney, Jr. 1941 version. Rick Baker's make-up effects and prosthetics are nothing less than amazing. It's dark, brooding and very atmospheric. I do not recommend the extended version, however, as it confuses the storyline slightly, and is really just overkill. The theatrical version is just right. Del Toro brings a pathos to the role that Chaney brought to the screen as a bit overwrought. Hopkins is very creepy, Emily Blunt is a suitable 'damsel in distress', and Hugo Weaving is perfect as Inspector Aberline. If you didn't like the original, or you're not a die-hard horror fan, you won't like it as much, but it will provide a good chill on a dark night. Also, the blu ray edition carries far more extras than the dvd, and the extra $ are worth it.",1316649600,,811,4.638888888888889
3600448,3,B001GCUO0W,"The Wolfman really IS a unique blend of adventure and gruesome horror elements.  Unfortunately, there's a few serious problems with the script.  The acting is *extremely* reminiscent of a dramatic high school play which means it's hard for me to get into *every single one* of the characters present during the movie.  Everything about the characterization is severely overproduced and it's a major interference to me.  The entire script feels like a bloated mess as a result.  I hate it.  A comparison to a high school auditorium play is honestly totally appropriate.  The acting is borderline unbearable.

However, the most shocking aspect of the Wolfman is the way it's somehow able to move beyond all that cheesy and unnecessary play-like acting and focus on really intense and downright disgustingly violent segments that involve a Wolfman going crazy in the woods and attacking people randomly.  Make no mistake about it- the amount of blood you will experience is REALLY high and the segments themselves are incredibly graphic.  Expect decapitations and other intense types of violence courtesy of the Wolfman's sneak attacks.

Talk about surprising the way the movie writers went back and forth between two drastically different writing styles that honestly don't blend very well together, which will definitely make it extremely hard for most people to admire a movie like the Wolfman and will therefore struggle to enjoy the overdramatic acting in between the blood and violence.  As a result, most people will have to be extremely patient to sit through a movie like this because boredom is probably highly likely to occur.

You have far fetched cheesy acting on one side and sickening violence on the other.  It's hard to be a fan of *both* styles so don't be surprised if you end up feeling disappointed after the film is over.",1314748800,3,1840,5.049668874172186

3600450,2,B001GCUO0W,"Hopkins was good and so was del Toro. The scenes of violent animal mayhem were masterly done through special effect. But the story was too simplistic, the connection between scenes were hastily made and although Hollywood is all about ""make believe,"" this movie could not hide it, which is the matrk of a good movie anyway.
There are several movies like that, and I guess any of them will do if you are interested about werewolves. I suggest you pass.",1313884800,,451,4.65
3600451,2,B001GCUO0W,"The director's cinematography wonderfully embraced the classic style of horror films with haunting landscapes & sets, even the ""transformation"" is cool.

A fabulous performance from Benecio Del Toro, makes the film much attractive and exceeds one's expectations easily. Benecio's performance is enough to get hold of your eyes and glue them to the screen quite easily. The rest of the cast deliver a decent performance. Overall, the film is very well made and if you liked 'Ginger snaps', give this a try, you won't be disappointed.",1312934400,,629,4.943396226415095
3600483,2,B001GCUO0W,"This could have been a great film. The cast is excellent, the cinematography superb, but the story, well, not so good. And the special effects were sometimes lacking. When he changes into a werewolf it is considerably more goofy looking than American Werewolf in London.  Don't get me wrong, AWIL was a great film, much better than this predictable and dry piece of work, but I would have thought that given all the advances in technology and special effects, this one would have been better. Also, the werewolf is laughable. He reminds me of the old black and white version, and in parts, the manerisms are exactly the same. He just looks like a man in a suit wearing a halloween wolf mask and chest hair toupee. He goes from being bipedal to quadrapedal which makes no sense at all since he just looks like a hairy guy with a dark nose and big teeth. Not like a wolf at all, which is what I thought a werewolf was supposed to be. It would have been better if they had gone one way or the other with it, either making him into a wolf, or making the metamorphosis much more insignificant instead of the strange wolf man hybrid a la The Isle of Doctor Moreau

The movie begins with Del Torro recieving a letter from his would be sister in law asking that he return home from America to help uncover what had happend to his brother whom had recently gone missing. The first half hour was compeling and interesting, made more so by the incredable cinamatagraphy. Truly second to none.

Spoiler Alert!: Ok, so the movie is a bit predictable, no big deal as long as the story is good right? Unfortunately this is where the film really falls short. The fact that Hopkins turned out to be the primary werewolf was not a big surprise. That he was the one that murdered his own son was. That he was jealous of his own son to the extent that he would kill rather than let him leave his house and take his (Hopkins son's) fiance with him was where this story began to unfold like a bad soap opera. He had no remorse for either the deaths of his son or wife which he had dirrectly caused, leaving very little seperation between monster and man. The only differences between his wolf self and man self seemed to be appearance and the power of speach. One of the things that made AWIL great was the horror that the man felt after realizing what he had done. There was nothing like that here.

The abundance of gruesome deaths was ok, but really seemed gratuitis in that it did little to add to the story or make it any more compelling (except in a couple places, such as in the asylum). Just another Hollywood movie, rife with cliche's, shallow characters and bad plot twists. By the time I got to the end, and found myself wondering if I really don't have anything better to do than keep watching this movie. And then I was surprised again. But not in a good way. Yes, unfortunately it just kept getting worse. The battle between the werewolves Hopkins and Del Torro, was hilarius. Like bum fights on steriods with super powers. It reminded me of nearly every other bad monster film I had seen. Trying to add suspense to a movie that has none by throwing in a gratuatis monster fight. But I have to admit it was funny, and really the only bit of comedic relief in the entire film. It ends exactly as expected, although for a moment I thought they were going to go with the AWIL ending. This might be a good movie to watch with a few beers and a few friends. It might be worth a few more laughs that way. This film really does take itself too serioulsy given the flimsy plot line. It's probobly worth renting or watching on cable, but I would not recomend buying it.",1312588800,,3652,4.366176470588235
3600484,1,B001GCUO0W,Why Amazon.com is selling a blu-ray with expired digital copy authorization code and not advise customers about it?  I purchased this blu-ray for a digital copy.  I should have just purchased a digital copy from iTunes.,1311379200,,219,5.055555555555555
3600485,5,B001GCUO0W,"Let me say it upfront:  The 2010 version of The Wolfman is the best wolfman/werewolf movie ever made.  Hands down.  Nothing else even close.  American Werewolf In London? - great picture, but not as good.  1941's The Wolfman with Lon Chaney, Jr.? - not even close.  The Howling - no sir.

Okay, now that a lot of people are calling me an idiot here are my reasons.  The cinematography is outstanding as are the settings and costumes.  The foggy woods are beautiful and eerie, Talbot Manor bleak and dreary.  The asylum and the town are perfect.  However, above all else the acting is superb.  When I first heard that Benicio Del Toro would be portraying Lawrence Talbot I grimaced.  How could anyone be better than Lon Chaney, Jr.?  Well, in my opinion Benicio was.  Some of his best acting in this film is when he is simply reacting to something and not even speaking.  For instance when Maleva is stitching his wounds after he is attacked when she bites off the thread and he screams and nearly comes off the floor.  I felt how bad that must have hurt because of his reaction.  Again, when his father wakes him up by the tree after his first night of killing.  When his father says ""terrible things"" the look on Benicio's face as he realizes what he has done and then he stiff legs it back toward the mansion in hysteria.  Great.  Or when he's in the asylum and he has been out of it and suddenly his father is sitting there talking to him.  When Benecico realizes his father is there he kind of rolls over with this ""Huh?"" look on his face.  Perfect.  Or when he is dunked into the water and comes up screaming.  His nod to Gwen.  All kind of non-speaking actions.

Anthony Hopkins:  I thought he was much better than in Silence of the Lambs which netted him an Oscar.  His habit of repeating most of his lines was wonderful.  ""Terrible things, Lawrence, you've done terrible things.""  ""Tis appears you were right Inspector, tis appears you were right.""  Also, what's the deal with him playing a harmonica as he leaves the asylum?  He plays creepy very well.

Hugo Weaving:  I loved his take as the inspector.  Many people will always think of him as Agent Smith from The Matrix films but he was wonderful here.  ""Ahm not yore enemy Mr. Tallllllllbot!"" great delivery.  And in the end when he realizes what's in store for him, yikes!

Emily Blunt:  I had never seen her in anything before so I can't compare her roles but I thought she was great.

And of course the other actors were all very good as well, but maybe the unsung star were the special effects, makeup, etc.  The transformation scene in the asylum was terrific.  Better even than American Werewolf in London or The Howling.  And the way those werewolves run.  Beautiful.",1309392000,5,2737,4.507157464212679
3600486,2,B001GCUO0W,"Few people would question the casting of the new wolfman. Benecio Del Torres as the brooding American son. Anthony Hopkins as the crazy old dad. Emily Blunt as the brooding widow. Hugo Weaving as the determined inspector. The acting talent is in good supply here, and the roles are well within the scope of their talents. It is the script, the directing, the cinematography and the editing that are incredibly sub-par.

Firstly, there is absolutely no drama or tension throughout the entire movie. Sure, there are a few parts where faster than light speed werewolves zip about giving the occasional startle, but even those scenes are diminshed by the script. The movie boils down to a series of slow brooding scenes which actually don't make a lot of sense when you look at them collectively. In other words, boring and stupid.

*SPOILERS*

Synopsis:

Part 1: Estranged

Beautiful English lady (fiance) finds American actor (actor) and asks him if he can help her find out what has happened to his brother who happens to also be her fiance. Evidently he is missing. The actor has not seen his brother in years, and is only recently in England, and is also estranged from his father for some reason unknown to us at this time. He declines her offer.

Part 2: Crazy Train

Actor is on a train, evidently having decided to help the lady for reasons never explained to us. He falls asleep on the train, dropping the picture he has carelessly left in his hand while attempting to sleep. The weird old guy next to him picks the picture up, remarks on it, waking the actor. The weird old guy tells the actor that he will give him his cane. Actor politely refuses. Actor falls asleep, again dropping the picture he has carelessly left in his hand. He wakes to find the weird old guy gone, but has left his cane. He can't resist and takes the cane, even though it might be the weird old guy just got up to go to the bathroom.

Part 3: Homecoming

Actor goes told old creepy dilapidated home. Meets creepy dad, violent dog, and Indian servant. Dad tells actor brother is dead. Fiance comes to visit, finds out, and stays for a while. Actor and dad have a very minor argument at dinner. Actor gives fiance brother's personal effects, and promises to find out what happened to him even though it is obvious some wild animal killed him and he would be unable to do anything about it if he finds out otherwise and despite the fact that he was hardly an able investigator and did not hire one. He also agrees to stay with his father for the time it take to find out what happened, even though he and his father are ""estranged.""

Part 4: Once Bitten

The locals believe in werewolves, and distrust the local gypsies and their evil dancing bear. The gypsies believe in devils. Actor goes to see gypsy queen who seems unable to do anything remotely interesting. Then the werewolf starts killing gypsies, and vigilante locals, but misses the local dancing bear which some of the locals blame on the killing. Actor wanders off chasing the werewolf to some sort of peewee stonehenge, and gets bit.

Part 5: Recovery

Actor heals remarkably well. Fiance seems interested in his recovery. Too interested. Clearly the fiance is becoming the love interest even before her former fiance is barely even cold. Village mob thinks he is cursed and wants to kill him, even though everyone knows he didn't kill anyone and is looking for his brother's killer. Law enforcement gives a lot of determined stares and asks probing questions. Actor feels strong. Werewolf strong. None of this could be considered unexpected in any way. We find out that the actor's mom ""killed herself"" and the evil dad locked away the child in an asylum after he witnessed it and then sent him to America to become sane again? At this point, we could care less. We'd already forgotten that there was any tension at all between the dad and the actor.

Part 6: Rampage

Sons goes on a rampage and kills a bunch of uninteresting people. The question is, why do werewolves kill? This movie suggests they are hungry, since they seem to eat people a bit, but they don't really eat much. They just take a bite and spit it out. After son wakes up find out dad is the werewolf that killed the brother, and used to keep himself locked up but killed the son because he would leave the house when he got married. Dad lets son get captured. A bit of drama, but really didn't care too much by then...we barely like the son, and we were indifferent about the dad. Actually, I have a hard time feeling anything about any of the characters since you don't connect with them...

Part 7: Asylum

What good is a victorian horror film without an asylum reference? Well, son gets put in asylum and turns into werewolf and kills all a lot of psychiatrists...  and then goes on the run. He finds the fiance, verifies that she is a love interest, and then goes home. Fiance agrees to try and help him...even though she has no idea how or why she even cares. She finds the gypsy who tells her nothing interesting. The cops come and arrest her for no real reason.

Part 8: Final Battle

Son goes home. Battles dad in human form. They both turn to werewolves. They battle each other in werewolf form. Kills dad. Burns house. Runs from house. Mob is there. Fiance is there. Werewolf runs. Mob chases werewolf. Fiance catches up to werewolf. Werewolf doesn't kill her. She doesn't return the favor. When werewolf dies, holds fiance's hand. Blah blah blah. All predictable.

Not recommended.",1308355200,2,5505,4.591233435270133
3600487,3,B001GCUO0W,"It had to be this way. Sorry.

Dialogue spoken in the film, but words which might offer explanation of the newest monster installment, The Wolfman. Killing (if you pardon the pun) many of the classics with remakes has become all too common recently, unfortunately. However, films are big business, and essentially money driven to a degree, and masses eat up the blockbuster type of film, even if it strips down the story, diminishes the characters, or leaves you with no real connection to anything in the viewing experience other than ""being entertained."" I don't want to get ""all nostalgic"" on you, because there have been clever masterpieces that past films couldn't duplicate. We just often look to the originals as masterpieces not because they were flawless, but because they have spirit, mood and emotional connection, something that one might have witnessed seeing Chaney in the original version of The Wolfman. In this version, the main problems were the overuse of unnecessary gore (just for the sake of it), the lack of cleverness, and the formulaic characterization. The Wolfman is a film that just shoves too much in your face-- and you see it coming a mile away-- which kills the fun of the intensity or creepiness in seeing a monster or villain film.

And yet, it's not all bad, really. What the remake is able to do is inject plenty of werewolf lore and legend in it, which does add to the atmosphere, although I wished the gypsies had more of a prominent role. Had they focused more on making us care about Lawrence Talbot rather than adding a hokey subplot of father and son (reminiscent of Teen Wolf) and superficial love story (why exactly do these two love each other?), I might have cared more about the film and been more involved. Instead, the viewing experience wasn't horrible, but just one that is easily forgotten, kind of like a fast food meal. Intermixed with appropriate Victorian background and dreary mood, we have lackluster main characters who trigger zero empathy. Consider Lon Chaney's Lawrence Talbot in The Wolfman's original: he had a genuine disturbing link to the horrible things that were happening to him, and his humanness necessitates pity on our parts. After all, we felt bad for him, and rooted for him even though we knew what had to happen. Here, Del Toro just seems to be sleepwalking. Sure, he does crank up the intensity somewhat towards the later stages of the film, when the action is high, but there's no build up to this point. Additionally. Talbot's father was a bit of an odd one. Maybe I'm the only one who thought that Anthony Hopkins' character turns into Hannibal Lector about the half way point of the film, with his calm, quiet instability bordering on homicidal maniac.

While this film strives hard to give us the atmosphere and background to the idea of the werewolf, it ultimately resorts to mainstreaming itself so we can get up, grab a soda and popcorn, and forget about the film soon after.",1308182400,2,2962,4.803921568627451

3600489,5,B001GCUO0W,"I had no intention of watching this movie, because the main star was Benicio Del Toro. And, it was not that I did not like him as an actor but that I did not see him playing the part of wolfman. I had seen him in Traffic & a couple of other movies and he seemed mostly layed back & more suited for drama than an action movie. Man was I wrong!! Having seen this movie, I now think he was perfect for the part. Although he was still layed back in his style, there was the inner strength that he portrayed that was very convincing. Also he was a bit unkempt & ragged in his looks which again was perfect for the wolfman role. The scene in the theater at the asylum ward is a case in point. When he pleads with his audience to ""stop it...."" & ""...kill me!"" His rugged features and vulnerability come through convincingly. Now, the make up and special effects were top notch. If you have seen ""American Werewolf in London"" & ""Howling"" the first one, then you will have an idea how good the creature looks. Because,  the work is done by the same creative genius of Rick Baker. But now he has the advantage of improved techniques & technology. This creature moves so fast that sometimes you only see a blurr, it runs on all four or up on two legs!! There is a decent story to carry the movie as well, with a decent love story, a family curse/bloodline and inspector of police who is a little too smart for his own good! Mix that in with gypsies, scared lynch mob townspeople, & a mad doctor and you have a stuck-to-your-seat movie until the end.  One cannot forget the acting of Anthony Hopkins. He played similar roles like this so many times that it became second nature.

SPOILER ALERT AHEAD. READ NO FURTHER IF YOU DON""T WANT TO SPOIL THE END.

Anthony Hopkins is chilling and great as sir John, his portrayal of sir John is the opposite of what Claude rains did and works great. Other elements in this film that I like to mention is the score by Danny Elfman its chilling and amazing it really brings out that monster movie vibe.

2. The musical score--well done.

On his return to the Jolly Old, he gets embroiled in circumstances surrounding his brother's brutal murder. OK: so he grew up with the Britsh accent, then developed an American accent, then his whole stage career involved accents, so he has unusual inflection. But it's jarring to hear him reveal unfamiliar intonation with some words/phrases. They kind of cover for this by giving him a backstory with a Spanish mom, but that's sort of lame.

2. Anthony Hopkins (and I love Anthony Hopkins) phones in his performance. He's the dad, and he falls into the curmudgeonly, somewhat remote but more-than-meets-the-eye character he's been using a LOT lately.

3. What about the gypsy kid who runs away from the encampment early in the film? I kept waiting for him to reappear. Maybe I dozed off! Or maybe the gypsy kid's main part was left on the cutting room floor. Or maybe the producers just forgot about him.

4. Some of the special effects weren't so special. We are living in the age of life-like Pixar, but this movie used some animatronics that were more similar to early Godzilla.

If you really really like the concept of people who shapeshift into predatory uber-canids, you might enjoy this addition to the pack.

Otherwise, send this film TO THE POUND !!!!",1303603200,2,2016,5.002994011976048

3600515,3,B001GCUO0W,"Being a huge fan of the Universal classics I was determined not to let that fact influence me in a negative way,but I was skeptical. I think the best re-do's pay respect to the original,but try to dig deeper into the myth,story and characters (I think they did a pretty good job w/ the new Batman films, and they made a fortune. The mythos of that story was elevated thru good writing, casting and acting. It was stunning to look at as well.). That's where this one came up short. Elfman was possibly the most miscast guy in the entire film. This score sounds like a car wreck between his score for Batman (nervous),Coppola's Dracula(overblown) and Jacksons King Kong (awful, boring even in action scenes. The only relief was in NYC where they actually used original music.) My wife was  recognizing  the melodies she was hearing, that we're `borrowed'  from KK. I think her best comment was ""It's like the music is doing all the acting in this movie."" Ah, what might have been. And yeah, the thought of Bride of Frankenstein being subjected to the same abuse makes you shudder. These old films had soul. Universal Studio is obviously being run by bean counters who could care less. Hats off to Rick Baker though. Sorry the CG-ers took your monster away from you man.
I read a blog post in which the person pointed out, and I believe this to be true, that certain of these old classics are better suited than others for a re-make. Bride of Frankenstein and King Kong are perfect films of their time and ours, and shouldn't be tampered with, as they could never be improved upon. Pure classics. The Wolf man however being more a 'sentimental' favorite, all be it a flawed film, is a much better candidate. That is why it is so unbelievable that the best elements of that film couldn't have been preserved (pathos, tragedy, character's emotional relationships),while technical advances in movie making and deepening story development applied couldn't arrive at a 'seriously taken' and believable treatment that a contemporary adult audience could invest in. Sooner or later, someone who really knows how to accomplish this and is willing to leave their ego at the door in service of these classics, should be allowed to be in charge of these projects. Otherwise, what's wrong with enjoying them for what they are. American cinematic jewels.
I also think it's worth noting that these gems we're viewed as 'B' movie projects back in the day as well. Pure attempts to make a buck at the expense of the source material by Universal. It was only the INABILITY of true artisans like James Whale and Franz Waxman, to view their work as frivolously as the studios viewed the film projects, that has elevated these films to their classic status. Not meaning to leave out the commitments made by Karloff, Collin Clive, Lugosi, and all the other greats even in supporting rolls. Everybody was a believer.
""The artist (in this case film makers) assume an awesome responsibility when exploring the depths of the human condition through story telling.""
I couldn't agree more. And I wish this view was shared by the industry. The reason these stories/myths became such great films to begin with, is we just lucked out that the originals were placed in the custody of people who invested them with a high level of integrity, innovation, and commitment of craft that all wound up on the screen. In short, they literally raised them to the level of an art.",1303171200,2,3436,4.752093802345058

And what was cool, is that the movie is done in old fashion. And atmosphere for the movie is really great. What was too much, is some scenes where the main character was dreaming, but thought he was awake and suddenly a werewolf appears, then again and again and so quite a few times through half of the movie. All those hallucinations he had were not necessary to show. And of course all the old curses stories of the Hollywood and silver bullets.

3600517,3,B001GCUO0W,"""The Wolfman"" is a pretty good movie to remake, but it kind of falls a bit flat in some ways. The thing that it doesn't fall flat on is the blood. There is tons of blood and body parts and a certain amount of grossouts. There's one scene where this random person falls from a window and I think ""Well, at least it's not going to be bloody"", and what happens next? He doesn't fall to the ground, the metal fence impales him and blood splatters. Basically all of the creepy scenes have blood in them, and for someone who can take a good amount of blood in a horror film, it was pretty gross, but for any fan who loves blood and gore in a horror film, here's one great bloody film.
  There are some pros of the film. I love the star-studded cast. You actually know the people, and it's not a bunch of no-names. It's full of great actors. The setting and time era of the film is also great. The whole vibe you get from the film is  also pretty good, and the pace of the film isn't that bad either. I also like the accents that the characters have.
  A couple cons are present in ""The Wolfman"". This film relies too much on blood and less on scares. I'm not saying it ruins the movie, but the film isn't scary at all. It's just kind of gross, but it doesn't completely ruin the film. There are some things that bring the film down, but ""The Wolfman"" is worth watching at least one time, because in my opinion, it's not a horrible film.",1301443200,2,1430,4.148014440433213
3600518,5,B001GCUO0W,"Just some thoughts...

The Wolfman (2010) is a remake of the original 1941 movie of the same name.  The movie's plot was changed considerably, though it does retain a lot of the original plot.  One huge change is that the movie now takes place in 1891.  This movie stars Benicio del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Emily Blunt, Geraldine Chapman, Art Malik, and Hugo Weaving.  The musical score by Danny Elfman is pretty good.

This movie is definitely darker and scarier than the original.  This movie has a lot of CGI, but it's done well.  The movie looks great - dark and creepy woods, fog, mist, a full moon, creepy interior sets, etc.  Some critics say that this movie lacks suspense and scariness.  I disagree.  I think it has plenty of suspense and scares, considering it's a werewolf movie.  What do you really expect in a werewolf movie?  I think it would be unrealistic to expect a werewolf to tiptoe around his unsuspecting victims.  A werewolf is part wolf (a wild animal) and part man.  What do wild animals do?  Wild animals just attack full throttle - that's it.  That's the style of the werewolf creature and werewolf movies in general.  Maybe that's where the so-called lack of suspense comes in.  The werewolves just suddenly attack, in other words, jump-out-of-your-seat moments instead of creeping around.  Look at what happens when a man transforms into a werewolf - once the transformation is over, the werewolf goes on the attack and goes berzerk.  However, there IS some suspense leading up to some of the werewolf attacks out in the woods, in my opinion.  Some people might not like how the werewolf runs on four legs, but stands on two legs.  I think the four-legged running is cool.  The werewolves look terrifying.

This DVD has the unrated director's cut, which is 1 hour, 59 minutes.  Also included is the theatrical cut, which is 1 hour, 43 minutes.  I like the director's cut a lot better than the theatrical version.  The extra 16 minutes contain a lot of good stuff.

3600554,3,B001GCUO0W,"THE WOLFMAN looks like a grand horror/thriller.  Dark forests shrouded in mist.  Gothic mansions set in pale moonlight.  Stop-action photography, innovative camera angles, goose bump-inducing special effects.  This is a well crafted film very much worth watching--just prepare yourself for an uneven, if not completely superfluous, story.

So much could be gleamed from the basic plot--the anguish, agony, and torment once Lawrence Talbot (a gloom-stricken Benicio Del Toro) learns he is a werewolf, doomed to kill and maim under each full moon.  Instead, this compelling story line is distorted and sidetracked by a romance never fully vetted, an inspector who constantly gets in the way, and by an aloof, eccentric father (don't get me wrong, Anthony Hopkins is his customary brilliant self) who has a showdown with his son that is nothing more than a howler.  (Pardon the pun.)  Accordingly we have a story that never finds a rhythm, that kicks and bucks and sputters and careens into silliness.  True, THE WOLFMAN looks good; it just doesn't have the story to be good.

3600556,5,B001GCUO0W,"From the moment I saw a clip online a couple of years ago, I knew that I had to see The Wolfman, and I was not the least bit disappointed! I do not know why the reviewers of all sorts like to trash this movie. Maybe they just don't get it? We all have our opinions and here is my two cents.

I have been fascinated by werewolf movies since The Werewolf of 1956. If one comes on the tube, I'll stop what I'm doing and watch it, even the bad ones, but this is certainly not one of those. It is the direct equivalent of Coppola's 1992 Dracula: the ultimate, high-dollar, first class werewolf movie. The sets and music are excellent. The plot may seem slow to fans of CGI overkill such as Van Helsing or Underworld, but I found the pacing just right for the tastes of a mature adult. The only reason I cannot declare it the best werewolf movie of all time is The Howling. Although that B-movie set in modern time is well crafted in the details of its characters and plot line, The Wolfman scores with its classic gothic setting. The two movies are not exactly comparable due to these factors, but I don't think any others are close to these two.

The most impressive things to me about The Wolfman are that the surrealistic photography and effects are riveting and the big growler is so vicious. The critters in The Howling are much more wolf-like in their shapes and personalities. The Wolfman features a werewolf that is more human-shaped and he still wears his clothes, although in tatters, much like the 1941 Chaney version. The first scene that really impresses me is when he rips through the gypsy camp like Jaws near a crowded beach. Yes, I had to suspend belief a bit, but this IS a monster movie. Even without the extended snout, big teeth, and the morals of a serial rapist like Eddie Quist in The Howling, The Wolfman is just plain fierce!",1296950400,3,1846,4.394736842105263

The performances are dialed in (Benicio del Toro practically sleepwalks through this one), and only Emily Blunt's character manages to shine at all.

The great difference is that the actors are uniformly superlative, not second-raters like Lon Chaney, Jr.  Of course, the effects are also superior.  Finally, the plot of the story diverges significantly from the original, which makes it stand on its own as something new, with somewhat richer themes than the original.

This one however is a good version,  All the acting in this one is done very well to be sure , I could havd done without the father/son struggle but it gave us a battle of the wolfmen for a climax so it did have some validity. This blu ray looks stunning though, just beautiful and that's because it's a modern film shot on high quality film. THe cgi effects look overall top grade too, one thing that's classic about this one is the way the wolfman looks ,much like the traditional version and it works very well in this movie. The wolfman is a frightening half man , half wolf creature that can run like a wolf. Something the original couldn't do but that doesn't make the original less a true classic movie though. The blu ray has the unrated version and the theatrical version , plus deleted scenes and documentary stuff which are in hd as well. I could do without the digital copy though if it will bring prices down lets get rid of digital copies for good. I don't buy this to watch on tiny computer screens or laptops.  Some people were turned off by the gore but lets be fair here this is a movie about a werewolf that tears people apart and eats them. The cgi effects have progressed alot since the last well bigger budget werewolf movie 'cursed' for sure , it's amazing how far effects have come in 6 years or less. Still only twits complain about effects of older movies they were fine for their day usually and still bring me enjoyment even from the 1930's era. The story is much the same about a man bitten by a werewolf who becomes one and fears and hates what he has become so that is a plus for this one. I would say that if you don't like gory movies then  you won't like this one , but it didn't bother me because I am a horror fan. And the people who made this movie were fans of the original wolfman series and probably the great paul naschys very gothic wolfman series; 'mark of the wolfman' and such which are worth grabbing too. 'night of the werewolf and vengence of the zombies' are on one blu ray , it's old school werewolf fun though don't expect cgi effects. But I love old horror movies. I have tried to grab most of naschys werewolf movies on dvd too. This is bloodier than those but naschys has alot of good vibe to it too.
I would say horror fans will like this movie and others may not, but at least it has excellent acting from the lead actors involved Benico Del toro is truly excellent in this movie. His torment is really conveyed to the viewer throughout this movie. So grab this one and check out naschys film too if you are gothic werewolf fan.",1293753600,3,2732,4.25
3600561,4,B001GCUO0W,"I enjoyed this film in the movies, I enjoyed the unrated director's cut on blu-ray even more.  Taking place in 1891, this is a remake of the original Lon Chaney Jr. film with some exceptions and plot differences.  Benicio Del Toro plays Lawrence Talbot, an actor, returning to his families mansion  in England to investigate the brutal death of his brother (that we see in the first scene in the film.)  Needless to say, this doesn't turn out to ba a great idea in the end.
My favorite aspect of this film is the sense of atmosphere.  The mansion where his eccentric father (Anthony Hopkins) lives is properly gloomy and cobweb encrusted and the forest mist-covered and freightening.  There are several very violent attack scenes, particularly one great sequence of the werewolf running amok in London.  Del Toro seems to be sleepwalking throughout most of the film although, to be honest, perhaps thats the way the director wanted him to portray this sad and disturbed character. (Del Toro talks about how badly he wanted to make this film and play this role on one of the retrospectives on the making of the film.)  Hopkins chews the scenery as his crazed father and Emily Blunt is properly lovely as his dead brother's fiancee with whom Del Toro falls in love.
There are many extras including deleted and extended scenes.  There are 2 alternate endings.  (After watching them, one can see why they were not used.)  There is much more ""Making of"" material including a segment on Rick Baker, who produced the amazing transformation scenes.  Baker won an Oscar during the '80s for his legendary transformation scene of another werewolf film: ""An American Werewolf in London.""

3600594,5,B001GCUO0W,"When you think about it, of the five classic monsters--Wolfman, Mummy, Frankenstein, Creature from the Black Lagoon, and Dracula--only Dracula could be considered as really evil.  Frankenstein and Wolfman were unwilling victims of bad luck, the Mummy made the mistake of loving a princess, and the Creature was minding his own business back in the Amazon River.  Still, all five of these guys became not only popular, but, indeed, beloved.

As I grew up with the original ""Wolfman,"" this re-make obviously presents a generational gap for people like me.  For example, the new ""Wolfman"" seems quite bloody, and the severed limbs almost comical.  But, taking the cultural divide into accout, let me tell you what I like about this flick.

First, I appreciate the fact that somebody saw fit to do a contemporary version of one of the classic monsters.  (How about another ""Creature from the Black Lagoon""?)

Second, to me, del Toro actually looks like Lon Chaney, carrying around that pre-doomed look in his eyes. (Too bad they didn't have the del Toro Talbot checking out Gwen's bedroom with his telescope like the Chaney Talbot!)

Third, the new Wolfman looks like the original, only much more menacing.  (Indeed, if the del Toro Wolfman was in ""Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein,"" Costello never would have made it out of Talbot's hotel room alive when trying to return that apple.) Also note that the new Wolfman, when running amok, stills wears clothes, just like in the original, and he has a great howl.

Fourth, Anthony Hopkins puts out an Oscar-worthy effort as Larry Talbot's father.

Fifth, the scene in the nut house, when Larry Talbot is wheeled out, and made to confront his supposed delusion by being exposed to the full moon, was flat-footed-yet-cool.

Those fears were thankfully allayed, however, upon the day I was finally able to catch ""The Wolfman"" in a theater. For all of it's modern-day technological glitz, I still found this to be every bit as atmospheric and engrossing as the original. Not only has Johnston paid tremendous homage to the Lon Chaney classic, he has also honored the lavish tradition of Hammer Studios with some of the most sumptuous set designs this side of Francis Ford Coppola's ""Dracula.""

Nobody can ever take the place of a legend like Lon Chaney, Jr. But when Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay began delving into Larry's haunted past, I bought Benicio's portrayal hook, line and sinker. He really did pull off a minor miracle. And I think the same can also easily be said for the incomparable Anthony Hopkins. There's very few roles this gentleman has undertaken throughout the many long years of his career that haven't entertained me. He exudes just the right amount of class and charisma this movie required.

The exemplary effects work of Rick Baker, I believe, also deserves notable mention. Updating the revered Jack Pierce wolfman makeup had always been one of Baker's major ambitions. And, for the most part, I think he succeeded. Del Toro, like Chaney, is a big man and he wears the creature's finished look quite well. I was just as equally impressed by the movie's accompanying bloodshed. Most other reviewers clearly weren't. But think about what a beast like this would do if it ever got ahold of you. Would it draw you into its arms for a quiet cuddle, or would it rip you to pieces? Gratuitous as the gore may sometimes be within the narrative context, I still viewed it as realistic and fitting. This is, after all, a werewolf we're talking about; a wild animal.

I only wish the DVD, itself, lived up to the same sort of praise I'm currently sharing with you here for the actual film. Unlike its Blu Ray counterpart, the barebones DVD release boasts absolutely no behind-the-scenes supplementals to speak of. And that's a shame because I, for one, would have loved to see and hear all that went into making this genuinely surprising and well-made gem.

It may be dividing fans down the center, as far as opinion is concerned. But, for me, this ""Wolfman"" was exactly the sort of old-school style horror that I would definitely like to see more of.",1291075200,2,2711,4.796573875802998

The story begins with a full moon in 1891 Blackmoor England. A man wanders at night, alone and unarmed. He is attacked by a wild creature. Gwen Conliffe is engaged to Ben, she asks his brother the actor about the missing Ben. Larry Talbot knows nothing. On the train a stranger offers him a silver-headed cane with a canine head. A two-horse coach carries Larry to the estate. [No servants?] A large dog barks at him. Sir John Talbot tells him the news about finding Ben's body. Did a wild beast do that? Were the foreign Gypsies responsible? Could it be a werewolf? Words in the inn lead to turmoil. Are the villagers ignorant and superstitious? [Why do they suspect the aristocracy?] Do actors pretend to be somebody they are not? A strange medallion was found on Ben's body.

Larry remembers his mother's death. [Symbolism?] Larry was sent out of the country (to explain his American accent). There is another full moon. Larry goes to the Gypsy camp to inquire about that medallion. ""Mazel Tov?"" Mounted riders with arms enter the camp. Something attacks the men? Gunshots are useless. Larry runs after the canine: it attacks him! There is no cure for one bitten by the beast. Larry recovers at home, remarkably well. A warrior must be armed against evil, even with silver bullets. A policeman investigates the crime, Larry alone survived. There are no natural predators left in England. Could it be a lunatic? A group of men try to capture Larry on suspicion. Is a stranger dangerous?

Larry orders Gwen to leave by nightfall. Is she in danger? The villagers cast silver bullets. The police detective waits in the village inn. Is Talbot Hall cursed (like the Baskervilles)? Why does Sir John visit the crypt at night? What does his talk tell? Larry undergoes a change in personality. The villagers hear a howl. Can they trap this beast? Who is caught? The werewolf attacks the crowd of men, impervious to gun shots. Can it be captured? Can ice water cure insanity? Or electric shock? Will Larry hallucinate? Sir John tells about his adventure in India, and its after effects. [Were you surprised?]

Larry is brought before a group of doctors for an examination about his delusions. [Note the amazing special effects from computer generated images.] Was this meant as a comedy? And so Larry is free to run over the rooftops like a wild animal. Pistol shots have no effect! [Too bad for anyone where the bullets land.] Gwen finds Larry, he tells the family secrets (a hereditary disease). The police detective questions Gwen about Larry. Gwen read up on ""Lycanthropy"". Will she ""set him free""? The police will shoot Larry on sight. Larry goes hunting too. Will there be a surprise? Can a werewolf defeat another werewolf? [More amazing special effects. Does this remind you of professional wrestling?] Will fire kill a werewolf? Or a silver bullet? The spell is broken, Larry is set free to go to a far, far better place. But what about that police detective who was bitten? [""Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"".]

This is inferior to the 1941 original movie, which had more integrity. This version runs on too long with its extraneous scenes. Its great special effects got in the way of the story. I read that Curt Siodmak, the original writer, concocted those legends of werewolves (silver bullet, etc) which became part of popular beliefs.

I guess I just wasn't awed by the movie.  There was really nothing wrong with the acting.  The monster make-up was pretty effective and cool.  I enjoyed the setting and the atmosphere of the movie, I found that to probably be my favorite part of it.  The movie didn't bore me, it actually did hold my interest.  I don't mind taking your time to set a movie up before you get the the ""good stuff"".  I think the main thing that holds this movie back for me is that I didn't think the tension was there.  He turns into the Wolfman and dismembers a bunch of people we care nothing about.  It seemed as if the Wolfman scenes where there simply to show how savage and brutal a beast he is by inserting as much gore as possible (of course I did see the unrated cut, maybe not so gory in the theatrical release?).  Not that I mind gore, but it's not enough to scare me.

I guess it would be best to look at this movie as a Drama with some crazy moments of violence interweaved throughout.  And as a drama, it's a decent movie.

Just as you can't always trust good reviews, neither can you trust a host of bad ones, as for this Wolfman remake. It took me a while to get around to it, but I'm glad I did.

I normally let Amazon's own ""Editorial Review"" slide by, but Robert Horton's is so laughably ignorant that it's worth mentioning. I sure hope they didn't pay him for it, unless it was a plugged nickel. He refers to the werewolves as all CGI when in fact they are beautiful real masks/suits and make-up by perhaps the greatest creature/powder guy in cinematic history, Rick Baker. Nice eye, Robert! What an expert. He also makes no mention of Elfman's exemplary score or Hopkins' wonderfully edgy performance, but of course makes sure to take the opportunity to dis Van Helsing, de rigueur amongst monster fans with zero sense of humor or irony, which VH was hilariously laden with. That half-blind fanboys like Horton are so insistent on comparing all new Universal efforts with the originals only highlights the strengths of this solid reworking of the original Wolfman.

While that first lycanthropic gem certainly is classic, it also has its share of hokey moments, and for me there were few of those in this new version. It's no masterpiece, but I found it surprisingly enjoyable. It's gorier than the 1941 version, but not gratuitously. It's got its share of scares, but they worked organically for me and rarely seemed cheesy. I expected a lot more cheese here, actually, and even Del Toro held up well, no mean feat when compared to Chaney. Hopkins is just as good as Rains as Talbot Sr. in his own way, remolding the role to suit himself and coming up with one of his best scary takes since the original Hannibal. Weaving almost steals the show; as in The Matrix, he's the perfectly imperfect cop, and really knows how to make you both loathe and feel for his character. He's due for a major breakout role, as he sure is a fine actor.

I also liked the rewrite; Von Sydow's mysterious donation of the silver cane is a fine touch, and many of the other new details work well. Rather than ape the original, director Johnston makes his own film and in its own way I think it holds up just as well. I loved the foreboding darkness throughout, and on blu-ray the various black depths come to life. The lighting is suitably dramatic and while there's little of Van Helsing's self-mockery, there are moments of sly humor that surprised me. Johnston uses the medium to great advantage; the tight cuts and quick flashes as the wolf enters into Talbot's system are excellent, and I the transformation scenes realistic and are as good as any I've seen.

The BD has a tight transfer as well as many extra features, with some good interviews with the stars, a wonderful piece showing how Baker created his own version of the werewolf, and various other enjoyable shorts.

I expected little from this film given its weak reception, but a reviewer whose opinion I respect here (certainly not Horton's!) wrote well about how decent it was, and I'm glad I read his review. That's why I find this site so useful: I can reliably trust those who share my tastes on other films, and use them to find films I would otherwise never have watched. And I can also happily ignore people who don't even know the difference between CGI great make-up and prosthetics.

If you enjoy the dark foreboding feel of Victoriana in the Rathbone Holmes and many of the great old monster films, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by this version of The Wolfman. I sure was. And as always, be sure to watch it at night with all the lights out!",1286323200,2,3601,4.608424336973479
3600649,3,B001GCUO0W,"Hollywood cannot be that hard up for material. By remaking this 40's classic and basicially following the original script with many deviations and changes, hampers what could have been a good movie. Had they followed the example of the ""Mummy"" movies, which did not follow the original Karloff classic, they created a wildly sucessful series of three movies.

This convoluted entry ironically casts Benicio Del Toro as Lawrence Talbot who oddly looks a great deal like Lon Chaney, Jr. (the oringal wolfman). But that is as good as it gets here folks. The original script has been mutilated, it is filled with flashy CGI that interferes with some very good atmospheric shots.

The unrated version didn`t really get going until Anthony Hopkin`s true character was revealed. Once the movie picked up speed I found it to be excellent.

3600651,5,B001GCUO0W,"Universal Studios almost redeemed itself for Van Helsing as The Wolfman was a great, great remake!  Almost everything that I found to be terrible about the Van Helsing movie did not occur in the Wolfman. Wolfman took itself quite seriously, with creature effects that incorporated the original makeup marvelously updated, and great actors like Anthony Hopkins. Almost all of the original film inspired some portion of this film, which is due homage.  The new plot twists from the original were needed since we did not wish to know how this film would work out in the end.

The special effects which involved computer animation were not quite as good as the makeup or the prosthetics which were used. Now tell me it was all computer animated. I think computer animation effects are much better suited for Sci-fi than horror and non-organic set type visuals, than live action creature effects. For example, I felt that the animation work on this film was good but not quite as effective as its close in makeup, or say An American Werewolf in London, which was definitely all prosthetics.  If anyone writes a comment that everything was computer animated in this film I will only say I am surprised (in advance). The creature effects in this film, (which I believe to be prosthetics) were absolutely amazing.

I loved the depicted ""sets"" or corresponding computer generated settings, loved the costumes, loved the music, loved all the characters and absolutely loved Hopkins who always adds something magical to any movie.  I did not even know this movie was made until watching it recently on a rental.  I am going to purchase it from Amazon, after deciding if I want it in Blu-Ray or not.

It is the grieving fiancee (Emily Blunt) that gets in a picture when she asks for help in finding her fiancee's killer.

Del Toro stars as Lawrence Talbot.  He has just received a telegram from Gwen (Emily Blunt), his brother Ben's fiance.  The telegram states that Ben has been missing for a considerable time.  Leaving his acting troupe behind in New York, Lawrence returns to Talbot Manor to assist in the search for his missing brother.  Upon arriving, Lawrence's father Sir John Talbot, played magnificently by Sir Anthony Hopkins, informs him that Ben's mutilated body had been found.  Sir John said that the body was mutilated by some sort of beast.  Lawrence discovers that Ben was wearing a gypsy necklace when he was killed.  He takes the necklace to a local group of gypsies to determine its significance.  While there, the camp is suddenly attacked by the beast.  Lawrence is bitten while trying to help, and the beast flees.

An elderly gypsy lady tends to Lawrence's wounds and she recognizes their significance; a werewolf's bite was the cause.  According to legend,, there is no cure for the bite of a werewolf.  The recipient then turns into a wolf themselves.  Now, Lawrence must face the horrible transformation each time there is a full moon.

In the meantime, the detectives at Scotland Yard have been trying to solve the rash of killings.  The lead inspector, played by Hugo Weaving, is suspicious of the Talbots, and he's keeping close watch on Lawrence.  Sir John, thinking Lawrence is insane, has sent him to a mental asylum to undergo treatment. While there, Sir John visits Lawrence and reveals the identity of his brother's killer.  Lawrence is then bound to a chair and set in front of a large group of observers.  The lead psychiatrist tries to explain away Lawrence's condition, but the appearance of the full moon convinces them.  The inspector is on hand to witness this and barely escapes.  He knows with certainty about Lawrence's condition and sets off to finish him.  Meanwhile, Lawrence has returned to Talbot Manor for a showdown with his father, but sir John has his own surprise in store.  Lawrence's only hope of release is Gwen, but will she be able to help before it's too late?

I've seen the 1941 version of The Wolfman, and I enjoyed it very much, and this film is very good as well.  I feel that Benicio Del Toro does a very respectable job in portraying the Wolfman.  One major difference in the two films is that the original movie dealt more with psychological terror whereas this new film has much more blood and gore.  The stories are similar in the aspect that Lawrence Talbot appears in both.

The actors also have too limited a range to play across here. I'd looked forward to seeing Benicio del Toro and Anthony Hopkins star together. Both men have great faces and generally a great on-screen presence. But their usual charisma gets smothered in the dour monochrome settings of ""Wolfman."" It's as if one of the dusty brocade tapestries on the walls of the Talbot mansion had fallen on them, pressing them into the misty purple scenes.

I had thought that modern F/X techniques might have made man's transformation into wolf even more thrilling than it was in the Lon Chaney Jr. original of this movie. But it isn't so. If anything, the modern simulations make the transformation look almost ludicrous in comparison to the more nuanced elision from man to beast that the Chaney version accomplished. The wolf versions of the man look more like artifacts than ever.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  I am not a remake snubber. I think of movie remakes as like stage performances. There's always the same basic script premise, but the directors and producers make the story fit their vision. Whether or not that vision is any good remains to be seen. You don't see an outcry every time there's a new version of Hamlet on Broadway. Why should movies always have to prove themselves in comparison to an original?

  However, Wolfman will be yet another failure to keep the fires against movie remakes going.

  If you can't guess what happens, let me summarize:

(Spoiler Alert! Not really. This movie is surprise free. You can get the plot from the trailer. I guessed correctly from the trailer about who the original werewolf was.)

  A young Shakesperean actor, Benicio Del Toro, returns to Blackmoor to learn what happened to his murdered brother. He gets bitten by a giant dog, and every full moon he turns into a smaller, hairier version of the Incredible Hulk. In doing so, he becomes the greatest Shakesperean actor ever, causing jealousy from Aberline, a detective from Scotland Yard. Everyone thinks he's just a madman, so they send him to London, where he goes on a short killing spree in a mental asylum, probably because they kept dosing him in ice water. When he becomes human again, he goes back to Blackmoor to confront the original werewolf, his father Anthony Hopkins, who rips his shirt off as they go at each other in wolf-fisticuffs. After killing his father, he tries to sex up his dead brother's girlfriend, played by Emily Blunt, who shoots him.

  So, what works? Well, the acting seems as realistic as possible. Unfortunately, the story is so boring, that the only time you really wake up is three-quarters through when you hear Benicio Del Toro raise his voice, yelling ""I will kill all of you!""

  But after that, you can go back to sleep.

  The transformation effects were very good. Using CGI for the transformation gives a lot of leeway in what you can accomplish, and it shows how torturous such a transformation can be. The problem is that at the end of the transformation, there is Lon Chaney's wolfman, in all of its understated glory.

  The story suffered above everything else, mostly because it left few surprises. You knew what was going to happen from the preview, so there really wasn't much to look forward to. Even the intense gore from wolfman attacks were yawnable. It's amazing that this script was rewritten during shooting. I'd hate to see what it looked like before.

  I'm sorry, but I am falling asleep as I write this, as I have to dredge up how boring this movie was again, and it is putting me into a napping mindset.

  I give this movie 1.5 full moons. Do yourself a favor, and watch An American Werewolf in London again instead of this waste of time.",1283126400,,3165,4.8542056074766355
3600710,3,B001GCUO0W,"Oh, here I go with my standard WTTW (word to the wise) when faced with posting a review for a certain style of book or movie: this book/movie/production has or is imbued with a certain old-fashioned sensibility. Whether you like that sort of thing (or not) depends on how much you will like the resulting book/movie/production. If you like it, you'll be blown away. If not, then you'll be yawning your head off and looking to see how much time has passed.
This re-imagining - or rather, re-working - of the  iconic 1941 Lon Chaney version of the Wolfman story seemed to me to be a classic 1930s horror flick, updated with top-of-the-line acting talent, extensive location shooting at the most stately of English stately homes, elaborate costuming - and oh, my the special effects; miles above what was available at that time. The horrific transformation of the protagonist from man to wolf in ""An American Werewolf in London"" set a high bar for painful realism, or so I deduced, (I had my eyes closed during the most awful parts of that particular movie) and the director, Joe Johnston took full advantage of that - and other familiar elements and conventions of the classic horror genre such as dark forests, foggy nights, full moons, strange gypsy fortunetellers, mysterious family tragedies and decrepit mansions.

Benicio Del Toro stars as the younger son of an English lord, returning to his ancestral home, after the mysterious death of his older brother - his American accent and looks neatly explained by his having been an actor in America for years, and by his mother having been Spanish. There's something foul afoot in the woods by the ruinous stately manor, ruled over by his reclusive father, Anthony Hopkins, who chews the scenery remorselessly, as well as taking over just about every scene he is in. Another classic tell - a great actor appearing in what at first seems a small role - that means there is Something Strange & Significant Afoot, for there will be a denouement of Horrific Revelation, in which great acting chops will be required. Emily Blunt appears, somewhat peripherally as the dead brother's fiance and understated love interest - and doom. Hugo Weaving wanders in at first for no apparent reason as the investigating police officer, and wanders away again, howling. And there you have it - if you like classic horror movies updated, you'll love it.",1282953600,2,2384,4.869458128078818
3600711,5,B001GCUO0W,"( This review refers to the UNRATED version. )I am a huge fan of the old Universal horror films, so with that in mind, let me just say, try NOT to think of this as as remake of the LCJr movie. Instead, go into it the same way you would with any new film. Being a fan of the ""old"" Universal horror films,  I didn't want to like this movie, but darnt it, I ended up LOVING it! To begin with, the look of the film is glorious. Deliciously dark and brooding. The muted blues, greys and sepia-type blends are just gorgeous. The sets and scenery are beautifully and richly done. And the SOUNDS!!! Leaves brushing across hard wood floors or pebbled walkways, the heaviness of the doors felt every time one is opened, the sound of steps pressing into well-worn pine flooring, the rainfall, and of course, the sound of the...moment of attack. It reminds me of the Law and Order sound that is so densely layered that no one can really figure out WHAT went into it to create it.
 Del Toro really captures the pathos of the LCJr character and is the complete opposite of the scenery-chewing Hopkins. WHO imagined THAT happening? DelToro perfectly balances Hopkins' overacting with his subtlety. When he is not in changeover mode, he is quiet and seemingly contemplative. Though his character is a successful actor, you sense something deeply painful underneath; a sadness that holds him captive and will not allow him peace or happiness even when it eventually presents itself as an opportunity. Emily Blunt is perfectly cast I think, and handles her role with great deftness, being very careful to NOT fall for her fiance's brother too quickly or with too much ardour. Rather, her attraction seems a quite natural progression from gratitude to pity to honest affection. I cannot think of many other young actresses who would be able to pull that off. Hugo Weaving is brilliant as always, even in this small role. His voice alone is worth the price of the ticket. He could read the phone book and make it sound like Shakespeare. Check out ""V for Vendetta"" to see what real talent can be. When you can do an entire film with a mask on and still be magnetic, call the Royal Shakespeare Co. You're ready for your closeup. The supporting cast are well fitted to their roles, and many of them you may recognize from BBC features. The music is pure Elfman and even if it does have hints of ""Scissorhands,""  ""Batman Returns,"" and ""Sleepy Hollow,"" I think any musician who has been around as long as Danny tends to borrow from himself eventually.

The only thing I didn't like in the film were the occasional ""hokey"" howls, but apart from that, I think the whole production was surprisingly satisfying. And Benicio is just drop- dead gorgeous, and that didn't hurt a bit. Best regards.",1282780800,2,2765,4.625254582484725
3600742,1,B001GCUO0W,"As The Wolfman started with ponderous voice-over narration, I immediately sensed that this movie was poorly conceived. As it plodded along, failing to create dramatic tension or develop characters, my initial misgivings about the movie were confirmed. Bad writing led to wooden performances by otherwise good actors. Lame and unnecessary CG effects, coupled with ineffectively gratuitous gore, added insult to injury. The story (such as it was) failed to engage me, and I started noticing nagging, obvious problems with how some shots were lighted. All of the stylistic choices seemed ridiculously contrived and called attention to their artificiality. The whole thing completely collapsed into senselessness for me long before the ridiculous and ill conceived ""climax"".

 This movie is a dog, and a howler at that. There's just nothing here that I can recommend.

 Thanks, but no thanks. I would rather re-watch the original Wolfman, An American Werewolf In London, Brotherhood Of The Wolf, Dog Soldiers or Ginger Snaps! again.",1282694400,20,1028,5.446540880503145
3600743,5,B001GCUO0W,"I guess some weren't very impressed with this movie. I grew up with Lon Chaney Jr and Boris Karloff. The Wolfman was probably my most favorite. This blu-ray version is awesome. I love the special effects...Wolfman on steroids, watch him go.

The audio is great, Master Audio blows it away.

I wanted to come in and add a few notes. I've owned this bluray for a few years now. It never disappoints. If you own your own home theater and have researched set up and achieved a sound that is so good from your room that your wife turns to you in a movie theater and whispers to you, ""Your set up sounds way better"", then pretty much the only thing you can pick apart from these videos is the story content, because audio and video are usually right at the top with everything that is released here.

The bluray review of this movie, IMO was pretty harsh! If you are familiar with the bl/wh Lon Chaney Jr version, then you'd know there were several nods to the original. I though Del Torro was excellent, he loved the original and embodied his part. The confusion and torment he displays throughout the entire movie, as the plot develops, there are two elements that are driving ""Tolbert"" here, the fact that he's a wolfman and how he became this monster, and the feelings he's developed for ""Gwen"". All this acquired in his mind, and the realization of what he must accomplish!

Reviewers can rip and tear this movie apart all they like, but if you really take the meat of the story and lay it out, this is one great story. And what about the man on the train??? That's an entire eerie mystery in itself, that alone is a guarantee that strange and unnatural events are about to take place.

Yeah, this was and is an excellent movie. And with my 9.2 set up, you are ""in"" the movie, scene by scene. And the big escape from the asylum and the big howl perched up on the eagle statue, have your LFE dialed in good, the slight growl before the howl will reverb your room and chill you to the bone!

Also, instead of being kept in the shadows, the monster is shown way too clearly towards the end and looks more like a pissed off pit bull than anything scary.

3600749,2,B001GCUO0W,"""Mysterious Gothic feel"" is a buzz phrase for ""poor lighting"" because the special effects weren't that great. The acting was good and the story line was just fine. The movie was ruined by 19th century novelist dialogue that better fit a Jane Austin novel than a Gothic horror. The scenes tended to be dark to hide the fact the special effects have not improved since ""American Werewolf in London."" Lawrence Talbot is told by his brother's fiancee that he is missing. Talbot returns home only to find out his brother has been found dead, ripped to pieces. The movie is a complete bore until Talbot gets bitten by a werewolf and survives (not unexpected in a werewolf story). He then walks through the house and the dog growls at him. He stops as if he knows this is some kind of sign he is a werewolf. The scene would have worked except the dog growled at him all the time before he was bit and also (mini-plot spoiler) lives with Talbot's dad who is also a werewolf (revealed about half way through if you hadn't figured it out before hand). The gypsy woman which was great in the 1941 master piece is reduced to a minor character. Hugo Weaving plays a Scotland Yard investigator, thinks the killings that happen while Lawrence Talbot was away was caused by him, another bad plot element, which made as much sense as the dog growling. The werewolves in this movie just don't kill one guy and are done for the night, rather they go on senseless killing sprees. As in most werewolf movies the action jumps from full moon to full moon, which seem to come at an incredible rate.",1281052800,,1574,4.506993006993007

3600751,2,B001GCUO0W,"There is almost nothing to recommend this outing.  First, any hope that Benicio Del Toro might bring a touch of warmth or sympathy to the lead role of the tragic wolfman is dashed, almost from the instant he utters his first lines.  Second, the contrived plot device used to explain the fact that everyone in the entire cast except Del Toro speaks with a British accent (sent away to America by his father at a young age) is so lame that it leaves one with the sneaking suspicion that it was a last-minute edit, inserted as soon as everyone figured out that Del Toro was simply never going to master a British accent with any consistency.  Third, there is not the slightest chemistry between the tragic wolfman and Emily Blunt's character.  Finally, the special effects were lifted straight from ""An American Werewolf in London"", only not as effectively.

Benicio Del-Toro portrays Laurence Talbot with a bit of symbolic reverence to the mythological aspect of man vs his inner demons, or a fierce bloodthirsty beast,-his past plays into the intricate cinematic elements that showcase his relationships with the world around him, namely his father and the ultimate confrontation between good and evil that develops as the movie goes on. But like all battles between good and evil, it never ends, atleast in the movies. If you like the classic movie monsters and have a genuine respect for movies in general, you'll like this.

3600803,4,B001GCUO0W,"If, like me, you are a fan of old-fashioned horror movies then you were probably disappointed with ""The Wolfman"" when you saw it in movie theaters.  It was no secret that the  production was troubled, with lot's of starts and stops, retakes, recuts, and I even think the director was changed at one point.  It's most redeeming features were the stylish and atmospheric look of the film and the first-rate performances from the actors.  But the plot hitched and lurched all over the place, the pacing was off and even for a werewolf movie it didn't make a lot of sense.

So when the Blu-Ray came out, I was intrigued to see that it was of the ""Director's Cut,"" and was almost 15 minutes longer than the movie shown in theaters!  I'm happy to report that the extra footage improves the film in almost every way.  There is actually a story here - and a pretty good one - the pacing of the film is surer and more sustained, and it's even scarier than I remember.  On top of that, the hi-def resolution makes the wonderfully atmospheric set design, costumes, etc. more beautiful than ever.

Pop the popcorn, turn out the lights and enjoy it!",1280534400,3,1136,4.5024390243902435
3600804,4,B001GCUO0W,"Much better than I thought it would be.  For fans of Gothic horror, it's enjoyable just for the production design and photography.  It's look is more of a nod to Hammer than Universal, but it makes for some sumptuous wallowing.  The fantastic cast has a lot of fun hamming it up, without breaking the mood -- nice jobs, all the way around.  Composer Danny Elfman is at his hammer-and-tong most clichd here, but somehow that works as well.

And makeup genius Rick Baker is... a genius.  I'm extremely happy that the project opted to go with the old-school, bipedal, ""wolf-man"" approach, as opposed to the stricter ""man-turns-into-wolf"" model that's been used over the past couple of decades.  How long has it been since we've seen werewolves still partially clad in the tattered remains of their human clothing?  In the original werewolf movie slapdown, Rob Bottin's ""The Howling"" makeup and transformation scene stomped all over its competing ""An American Werewolf in London"" work by Rick Baker.  In this new movie, though, Mr. Baker reclaims his crown.  In spades.

The major criticism I have for ""The Wolfman"" is the unwieldy detour it takes at the end of its second act.  The chase through London does nothing more than expose some of the CGI flaws that plague this genre: CGI creatures bounding through a CGI environment, where the laws of physics -- chiefly, gravity -- seem to have a lot of loopholes.  Any plot points derived from this scene could have equally been transferred to the sinister Blackmoor estate and environs.  What might have looked good on paper just doesn't work on the screen.  On the other hand, it's not like the original Universal Studios version didn't have any of its own problems, so I'm inclined to give director Joe Johnston some slack.

(And speaking of the original Universal Studios version, big kudos to whoever conceived of putting a gorgeously-reworked 1940s Universal logo at the front of the picture.  Beautiful!)

The film starts with that dark eerie tone as Ben Talbot (Simon Merrells) hollers out in the night ""I know you are out there"" and is presently dispatched in a most untidy way. We are prepared for gratuitous violence. Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt) invites the wayward brother Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) to put off his acting position and return to the old family home to fathom out the culprit, be it man or beast.

I will not go through the story and al l its implications, as that is why you are purchasing this movie. However, the local Reverend Fisk (Roger Frost) had some rather unfriendly words about Lawrence Talbot's return. ""There are those who doubt the power of Satan--the power of Satan to change men into beasts. But the ancient Pagans did not doubt, nor did the prophets. Did not Daniel warn of Nebakanezer? But the proud king did not heed Daniel. And so, as the bible says, he was made as unto a wolf and cast down from man.""

***** One overwhelming negative is the noisy background compared to the dialog volume.

If you totally duplicated the film and just brought the technicalities up to date, it would be barley worth it. If you did as most movies do and just use the title many people who are comfortable with the originals as I am would hat it because there is nothing to relate. This film is a rare hybrid that brings the movie up to date, tries to maintain continuity and has a twisted plot. As a psychological thriller it barley scratches the surface. However, there is a clear love triangle as the hub.

Yes, there is a quickie view of Max Von Sydow handing Lawrence a silver wolf's head cane.
Hugo Weaving did a good job of acting but I kept thinking ""Elrond.""  Moreover, we wait for Anthony Hopkins' most famous line from ""84 Charing Cross Road"" (1987) where he says ""Very nice, very tasty.""

Remakes aren't a new thing, they've happened for quite a while now. But I wouldn't necessarily call this movie a remake, more of an alternate telling of the classic tale that we all know as The Wolfman.

The movie begins as any movie called ""The Wolfman"" would- guy is making sure nothing oogie happens in the woods at night, he hears a sound, searches for where he heard it, then BAM- he turns around and is scratched by the wolf. So he runs and runs, and before ya know it, he's doomed!

Anyways I wouldn't need to recycle the plot for anyone who knows the plot- Lawrence Talbot returns to his home in England after Tragedy strikes with the gory death of his brother. He is reunited with his dad and one night gets scratched by a werewolf. This leaves him with one thing he cannot control: at the full moon at night, he becomes a wolf.

This movie is stupid? Yes. It's pointlessly gory? Yes. It hardly has a plot and is just two hours of Benicio Del Toro going around ripping people to shreds? Yes. But THAT'S why the movie is so good! There's nothing that needs to be taken seriously. It's just two hours of werewolf mayhem.

The acting is excellent- everyone shines in the roles and it comes off as very stage-like. The special effects are great as always- and in total, the movie is just FUN. It's very fast paced, it thrills you for its duration. There's tonnes of gore too, which adds to the cheesy feel.

In total, this movie is cheesy, exaggerated, overblown trash, and yet I loved every single second. The whole movie was thrilling and fun, and in short, if you can turn your brain off for 2 hours, you'll enjoy the pure adrenaline rush that is ""The Wolfman"".

I got tired of all the main characters whispering throughout the movie like they were in a library or something.  The scene (warning spoiler) at the end of the film with the fighting werewolves was taken from The Wolfman's Predecessor, the Werewolf of London, rather than adapting things from the original film.  It was really a mix of both movies, faithful to neither.

3600848,3,B001GCUO0W,"It's so refreshing to see an honest to goodness `traditional' horror movie... a remake of the classic Universal movie The Wolfman.  There have clearly been some noble intentions here in recreating and updating one of the original classic Universal horror movies.  The end result however, is a little fragmented, not quite delivering on all the promise, but still with some stunning visuals and some highlights worth seeing.
It's a straightforward origins type story with few surprises.  Benicio Del Toro plays the role with minimum histrionics, while still convincing, and Anthony Hopkins is always a must see, even when rehashing past efforts, coming across as a mixture of Zorro's Dad and Hannibal Lecter..Emily Blunt and Hugo Weaving round out the cast, she as the love interest, and he as the dogged Scotland Yard detective.  Weaving is probably the most fun element in a movie otherwise lacking in levity.  Visuals are fantastic, echoing the gloomy long shadows and foreboding images seen in the best of early black and white horror.  Where it comes apart though, is the second half.  This is the half that departs most from the story of the original.  The efforts to update the story seem to have left the makers with too much story, and a need to shoehorn action setpiece after action setpiece, with not enough thread left to join them together, and the story presumably left somewhere on the cutting floor.  Del Toro is reduced to running around with some too-busy camerawork trying to catch up with the story.  It works ok, but you get the feeling this was a better film at some point between its screenplay  and the editing room... perhaps a little less gore filled action, a soupcon of humour and a little more story in a shorter movie might have done the trick.  And am I the only one that finds it a little odd to see all those dollars go into complicated computer graphics technology to update the wolfman, producing a cgi creature that looks - very much like the original guy in a suit..?
Critics were unkind and it's perhaps not difficult  to see why; the film begins to feel quite incoherent , probably the result of having had a change in director in mid stream - and yet with a fun visual style, some actors well worth watching and a classic tale, it's actually quite entertaining and well worth a watch despite its flaws.",1279238400,4,2341,4.750617283950617

Anthony Hopkins is not the caring father figure that Claude Rains was in the '41 version, in fact quite the opposite.

3600872,3,B001GCUO0W,"This remake of a classic doesn't at all do it justice.  While it hosts quite a few well-known actors, their superb playing cannot do anything for a plot that simply isn't there.

Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) is returning to his childhood home upon the disappearance (and as he learns later death) of his brother.  Having not parted well with his father it is also a homecoming of sorts.  His father (Anthony Hopkins) is currently playing host to his brother's fiance Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt) and it was she who let Lawrence know that his brother had gone missing.  Upon arriving he hears of his death and goes to look at the body, which is scarcely recognizable.

Determined to find out what happened to his brother he bites off more than he can chew when he is attacked by the same creature.  Barely escaping with his life he starts to notice things are off when his wounds heal faster than normal.  Frightened that he too is becoming the werewolf told in the gypsy's folklore he has no time to do anything when his father has him shipped off to the insane asylum.  There he is subjected to a number of horrific tests and procedures.  He's not sure he will be able to endure it and is scared because in just a few days there is another full moon.  What will happen then?

This movie could have been so much more with the cast of characters it provided.  As always, Anthony Hopkins, is delightfully creepy and does his role well.  However, the rest of the characters, no matter how good they could have acted, didn't have a chance with this movie.  The script just wasn't written well enough.  The dialogue was short and hardly had any substance to it.  There was nothing to make the viewer care for the characters.

The cinematography was excellent and I loved some of the scenes and landscapes that were featured in the movie.  While London was pictured as dark, it was more than made up for by the countryside of Lawrence's family home and the creek and woods surrounding it.  There was a fair bit of whimsy portrayed that probably was done with computer manipulation.  I do find fault with the way the werewolves were designed.  Surely for the stage of technology that is available they could have been done better.  However, to me they looked on par with the werewolves in some eighties or nineties movie.  The music to accompany this film was only so-so.  It did a good job of being instrumental and clashing at the suspenseful parts, but it was nothing fantastic.

Overall I would only rate this movie average.  It neither was terrible nor was it something I would be eager to watch again.",1278806400,4,2605,4.570194384449244

3600875,1,B001GCUO0W,"Even a fool, whose given a chance
  To remake a classic of old
  Can fruck it all up
  And still get rich
  While us fans are left
  Holding our nose
Universal's l941 horror classic, ""The Wolfman"" is the last of that studio's classic monster movies to be ""remade,"" ""rebooted,"" ""re-imagined"" with disastrous results.

There is ""The Creature From the Black Lagoon,"" that's just waiting to be ""remade...re-invented...rebooted"" by some hack and one hear's rumors that Rob Zombie--who destroyed the ""Halloween"" franchise--is eager to get his hands on ""Creature""--after he's done destroying the third or fourth remake of ""The Blob.""

The 2010 version of ""The Wolfman"" takes forever and a day to get started.  We're treated to thirty to 45 minutes of exposition before things begin to move and when we finally shake ourselves awake to see Benecio del Toro transform into the Wolf Man, it's like seeing Hoowdy Doody wearing a cat's mask. The actor plays his doomed role of the accursed Laurence Talbot with a hung-over air of flatness and boredom. When we first meet him, he's an actor performing in ""Hamlet"" and we're amazed the audience hasn't thrown enough rotten tomatoes to kill him.

We're suppose to sympathize with his love interert, Emily Blunt, who plays her part throughout with a breathless expression of doom. Anthony Hopkins phoned his part in. He plays his Hannibal Lecture personae with no deviation and delivers all his lines in that light, dismissive air with no suggestion that he knows the dark secret of his ancestry.

The dark, gothic look of this new version of the wolf man could have worked except you gradually feel slimed and cold. The big sequence of Laurence Talbot being bound and gagged in the medical room with dozens of medical experts could have been a show stopper--but it goes on and on.

All the qualities that made the l941 original so magical were typically discarded in this modernized re-teling.  Universal created on its backlot a small, intense world of relentless fog, a group of charismatic performers (espeially Evelyn Ankers as Gwen Conliffe) and that unforgettable musical score. The story moved fast with not a single dull sequence.  Maleva the Gypsy was played by tiny Russian dynamo, Maria Ouspekaya but as acted by an aged Geraldine Chaplin, she merely looks like a British woman dressed up for a masquerade ball.

Although Lon Chaney's wolf make-up might look simplistic today, it can still terrify mondern viewers with dramatic lighting and photography.

Watching the 2009 version of that classic can be depressing. It reminds one that about the only horror/slasher/sci-fi movies we see these days are all remakes, sequels, prequels.  The nearly $100 million budget to make the new wolf man, along with its marketing, could have been used instead to have given us something original, fresh and brilliant. Modern movie makers know they can make a fast buck by re-doing a cherished classic movie. They've got that built-in name familiarity which means victims--like myself--will naturally pay their money and sit.and hope for something original one day--like another original ""Psycho,"" ""Alien,"" ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,""--or even a brilliant creature faature like ""The Wolfman.""",1278288000,12,3223,5.124282982791587
3600876,4,B001GCUO0W,"Personally I've always preferred vampires to werewolves. It's not that I have anything against werewolves--after all, some of my best are...etc. Nonetheless, THE WOLFMAN does the subject & genre proud. In fact it's so good that the fact that Anthony Hopkins was in it didn't bother me at all (you see, I am sick to death of AH appearing in 1 out 3 of every made since SILENCE OF THE U KNOW WHAT.) The production values of WOLFMAN are up to the high standards of Copolla's DRACULA--or the production values of Hammer Horror at its' best.

Another big plus is that it introduced me to the acting skills of Benicio Del Toro. He's an interesting & intense actor. His looks aren't typical Hollywood (thank god!) but he's got good, strong features & plenty of animal megnetism (comes in handy for portraying a werewolf.) He has a wide spectrum of acting skill.

This is a good movie that's more heavy on gore rather than sex. One bit I found sort of funny was one in which a man is shooting a handgun at The Beast & said Beast rips his hand off--and the hand keeps pulling the trigger (ok, I've got a warped sense of humor.) The initial transmorphing scene is brilliantly managed and the final combat of the two werewolves is exhilerating.

I would say this WOLFMAN would be OK for kids 14+ (I mean, what's so bad about a animated disembodied hand compared to a lot of crap of TV they see every day?).

The scenery and atmosphere in this movie are just stunning.  The dark gothic feel is as good as any I have seen.  The Insane Asylum setting, with the old methods used in that era to treat people with mental problems is perfectly done.
The special effects in the movie are very well done, but very over used.  The movie felt like they were searching for every odd chance to throw in another bit of flying gore or another beheading.  The plot feels very thin and weak, and it is hard to tell if the CG effect fiasco was to cover for the weak plot, or the plot was weakend by the goal of getting in all the special effects they could cram in.  Unfortunatly with so many of this type of movie anymore this seems to be the case.
As far as the cast, Del Toro just did not do anything for me as the wolfman.  He seemed uninterested and the character felt forced.  I feel that Anthony Hopkins was completly under used in the movie as well.
In the end you are left still waiting, wondering if you missed something that would make it more interesting.",1278201600,3,1110,4.232227488151659
3600881,4,B001GCUO0W,"I generally enjoy comic-book type films like this.  And this is a good film, made better than average by the stunning cinematography and art direction.

Appropriately set in a huge but decaying mansion in the wilds of England, The Wolfman stars the always wonderful Anthony Hopkins as Sir John Talbot, the lord of the manor.  Talbot was married to the beautiful Cristina Contes (Solana Talbot), but she tragically dies before the film takes place.  Talbot has two sons, Ben and Lawrence.  Ben is found murdered, in a ditch. Lawrence (Benicio Del Toro) returns to help find his brother, at the insistence of Ben's wife Gwen.  Lawrence has been scarred by the death of his mother, and has moved to America to forget the painful memory.  And there is trouble in the old moor.  Mutilated bodies keep popping up; the townspeople find so many that it brings a investigator from Scotland Yard, Abberline.

Sir John is a slightly repellent figure.  Hopkins plays him in excellent fashion (as always), like a seedy, slightly batty older lord, falling slowly apart much as his manor is decaying.  The strange doings in the area (dead animals, and men) don't seem to perturb him too much.  His man-servant, Singh, is still there, helping Sir John with the running of the house (Sir John doesn't seem to do anything; there isn't a farm to speak of, just mysterious woods and dark ponds about.  I suppose the proverbial 'old money'.).  And then there is that brilliant full moon...

The film is excellently shot and cleverly put together.  The moon seems twice as large in the skies over Sir John's manor, and it casts an odd light everywhere, including the nearby town, which seems to be rapidly losing its male population.  The colors are vivid and strange when the full moon comes out, and the very environs themselves take on an other-worldly appearance.

Recommended.  It's a good film, solidly acted and well-made.  The opening and ending end-pieces of the film, with the tarot cards and the like is especially artful and vivid.  The set design is excellent, the make-up superb, and the costumes so good you don't notice them.  And there are those silver bullets.  The basic plot we've been seen before (so we know what's up when the silver bullets come out); most notably in the film with Lon Chaney, Jr. in the title role.

In the original Wolfman the title character carried the entire movie. The audience was moved to tears by the tragic tale of a good and kind man slowly transforming into a monster. Every seen with Lon Chaney, Jr was memorable. The Wolfman is less a story about ripping things to pieces and outward horror and more a story about internal conflict and the monster that lives in us all. The leader actor makes such a movie crash or fly, and in case of the 2010 Wolfman it crashes. Del Toro fail to deliver any depth to the character he is playing, he had no charisma on screen. I stopped caring for the fate of Mr Talbot and rather got interested in the amazing transformation sequences, the side characters, which are brilliantly acted and the beautiful visuals. Del Toro as the Wolfman fail, and then so to a certain degree do the movie.

3600998,5,B001GCUO0W,"Without re-hashing and giving spoilers I just want to state the things I loved about this film...

While not a fan of Joe Johnston's usual work (Rocketeer excepted), I have to say I love this film. In many ways it was uncompromising for a Hollywood production. Heavy mood, heavy atmosphere, heavy gore and free of that Stephen Sommers sheen! It was a win, win, win and win for me! Could it be Joe Johnston was born to make R-Rated films?

Again, this film broke away from many of the Hollywood stereotypes and was MUCH stronger for it.

Heavy Gothic feel. Something we just don't get to see too much of in modern cinema.

Emily Blunt. Mmmm, Emily! Oh yeah, the other leads were good too. Del Toro (as someone mentioned) initially seemed miscast but he was very effective! Hopkins played a great a-hole father figure, chilling and realistic as he did not break down to a stereotypical movie bad-father. Hugo Weaving's character also played an interesting counter-point to the rest of the characters and story.

This film also touched upon issues of social acceptance and subsequent misconduct (and the reasons why). Leading up to the conclusion, it also addressed wolf pack behavior and actions concerning the leads (sorry, this is as detailed as I can get without spoilers or hints).

The triangular relationship of father and two sons/brothers and how it evolved (mostly as back-story) and created the plot itself (again, as detailed as I will get to avoid spoilers) was well done and interesting.

The struggle of Talbot (Del Toro) and his emerging two halves, one being human, the other being animal was poignant much to the credit of Del Toro and Emily Blunt.

It ended in tragedy as any good werewolf story should. Everybody pays a price and no one escapes unchanged, if at all. John Landis's statement lives on, ""Being a werewolf is like having cancer, except instead of killing you, it kills everyone around you.""

Despite this film sometimes falling into being predictable and perfunctory, it was still enjoyable, carried on by a great cast, an interesting story (again, the whole father, two brothers dynamic) and great mood.

This movie is what it is; dark, moody, ugly, gritty and mean. It was a great werewolf fantasy encompassing both aspects of it (power yet the surrender of rationality) not to mention the horrific reality of it. For a big budget movie to be made like this now-a-days is truly a great thing and for that as well as my other listed reasons, I loved it!",1277251200,5,2484,4.7827102803738315

While listening to the commentary track for SIN CITY, Directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller discuss Benicio's desire to play The Wolfman in a remake, and that is the proof in the pudding about where I got ""vanity project"" from. So that can end that debate.

But the plot, at least to begin with, is identical to the Universal classic (it even has the old-school Universal logo at the opening). Lawrence Talbot, who had left his ancestral home in England for success in America as an actor. He comes back to his home after learning of the horrible death of his brother by what could be a maniac or some huge animal. He is greeted by his father, Sir John Talbot (played by Anthony Hopkins, channelling Hannibal Lecter AGAIN...), a famous big-game hunter who greets the ""prodigal son"" with the warmth of the English winters. He is also confronted by his deceased brother's fiancee, Gwen (played by Emily Blunt, who's performance is relegated to nothing more than a plot necessity), who quickly warms up to Lawrence... a lot more quickly than what one might expect from a grieving fiancee. Lawrence is also a man with a mission: to hunt the beast (or maniac) that killed him. He finds that his brother had some dealings with Gypsies that have put up camp nearby, and they are suspect because of their outsider status. He visits the Gypsy camp and the beast appears, and instead of exacting his vengeance, he is bitten by the beast. And the games then begin. Soon after the attack, an inspector from Scotland Yard comes to investigate: Inspector Mark Abberline (played with the barest vitality by Hugo Weaving), who is, in reality, one of the inspectors of the Jack the Ripper case, and there is a fleeting allusion to that in this film, but it is fleeting.

This is pretty much where the similarities end. Aside from a little easter egg moment with Max Von Sydow giving Del Toro a silver-headed cane (that houses a hidden blade), the best of moments of this film come in the various animal attacks filled with gore, evisceration, beheadings and more... and some of the moments of the sparse character development.

The biggest problem with this film is the fact that many of the people involved in the making of this film are extremely talented in their own right, but that talent is barely present throughout. As I stated, Del Toro is barely there. He plays some of the tortured elements of his character well, but that's about it. Hopkins plays to his specialty, which is chewing the scenery to nothing. Blunt is pretty much a ghost in this film. Her presence is barely there, and that's not her fault. She's been written into a corner that she has no way out of. Weaving is still channeling some of his Agent Smith persona (and can we have the line ""God help us..."" put on indefinite moratorium? Please?).

Then there are the behind-the-camera people. Director Joe Johnston is someone who can make a really good film (OCTOBER SKY, THE ROCKETEER), but he's still a director that is so incredibly reliant on CG effects, as he learned in films like JUMANJI and JURASSIC PARK III, that he's forgotten the joy that can be seen and felt in practical effects. There are SO MANY composite shots in this film that you honestly feel like every exterior shot is somehow off-kilter, even if it is natural. And the CG feels INCREDIBLY rushed. If it worked better, I might think better of this film.

Writers Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self do what they can to give more depth to the film as opposed to the simplicity of the original. In many areas, it doesn't work, sadly. Both of them have written terrific films in their career. Walker rocketed to instant acclaim with his amazing script for David Fincher's masterpiece SE7EN and did some polishing on Fincher's other masterpiece FIGHT CLUB. Self wrote ROAD TO PERDITION and THIRTEEN DAYS, both very underrated films. But here, they don't bring anything that really shines or haunts, which is what a great horror film should do. You should leave still feeling scared but exhilarated.

The greatest tragedy of this film though sadly lies on the shoulders of SFX innovator Rick Baker, who is no stranger to werewolf films. He designed, created and reinvented the werewolf transformation in John Landis' AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, which treats you to the most agonizing and amazing transformation from human to wolf that has ever been committed to film. And the miracle of that was it was all done with PRACTICAL effects. There was no CG. It's still state of the art now, and that was fron 1982. And now with all the innovations in technology over the last 28 years, the design and the CG transformation for the Werewolves in this film are so incredibly fake that nothing is convincing. Not even the movement looks real for a moment. Think about that for a moment. Rick Baker has been given the opportunity and the technology to do something even more convincing than the pinnacle of his technical achievement than something he did 28 YEARS AGO, and it looks like a cheap UNDERWORLD knockoff.

So yes, this film is a barely 2-star film because it does hold some interest for the viewer, but once you get to the end, you realize that you've just wasted more time than you would want to.",1277078400,3,5653,4.662988966900702

3601034,5,B001GCUO0W,"Saturated with more symbolism than blood, this remarkable remake has transported the story of Lawrence Talbot back to Victorian times and imbued it with a moody gothic melancholy.  Moreover, the protagonist seems much more estranged and foreign than the original character.  Not only has he matured in America, but his maternal heritage can readily be construed as Hispanic.  In the Anglo/Celtic climes of Blackmoor and London, he is the dark other, with shadowy cultural and ethnic links to the sojourning Gypsies and the estate's Sikh servant.  His once adventurous father has sunk into a saturnine lethargy in which he lolls about in tiger and leopard lapelled robes, amidst the mounted heads of long dead beasts.  One can almost sense the ephemeral veil not only between man and animal, but that between idleness and evil.
But it is, of course, this misty, human/non-human veneer that drives this tale of old.  And, for afficionados of traditional cinematic lore, this retelling should deliver in ways unexpected in modern flicks.  Silver is still lethal to lycanthropes, the full moon still triggers transformation, and the bite of the lupinoid monster still bespeaks doom.  There are no pentagrams in palms, but the werewolves look horrifyingly Chaneyesque, and their primeval howls can utterly vibrate human viscera.
Fortunately, CGI effects fail to flatten the film's overall creepiness and suspense.  The now ubiquitous mow-down massacres do occur, but dim lumination and light-speed animation mute the resultant bloodiness and move the action forward to the attacks' aftermath.  Then it's back to the somber, brooding gloom that marks all great horror movies.",1276992000,9,1669,5.360153256704981
3601035,3,B001GCUO0W,"Only by coincidence I watched The Wolfman on Father's Day,the movie that sends Fatherhood back to the Stone Age and although the movie has bursts of violence and gore, it is also surprisingly  slow and tedious.  The movie, handsomely mounted with atmospheric lighting and camera work, finds Benecio Del Toro, playing an actor returning home upon learning his older brother has been killed and mutilated by an unknown entity. Upon arriving at the family manse he finds his father played by Anthony Hopkins curiously unaffected by his son's death. Also on the scene is Emily Blunt as the murdered son's fiance and again the brother is forgotten as she transfers her affections to Del Toro. It is she who reads gypsy lore that a werewolf can only be killed by a silver bullet delivered by someone who love him. And she proves she loves him.

However the movie ends with a recent victim of a werewolf hickey not yet turned.

As an actor there is something about Benicio Del Toro I can't explain why that I find oddly fascinating.  Maybe it's his unique acting style-""Sleep-walking"". Right off the top of my head I can't recall any other actor in cinema history who looks badly in need of a good night's sleep. Maybe NYTOL would help. And it doesn't help matters much that his CGI alter-ego, the werewolf is prettier.  But still there's the fascination.

All in all, The Wolfman is okay but if you like your horror movies with a little more oomph and a lot more horror,if you pass on The Wolfman you won't lose any sleep, the same sleep Benecio badly needs.",1276905600,,1552,4.642335766423358
3601036,2,B001GCUO0W,"Underwhelming. A phenomenal cast, underutilized, yet even full force efforts could not save this one. Star Power Anthony Hopkins (not even close to his creepiness in other horror roles) plays Sir John Talbot, a widower whose betrothed son has just been murdered by a monster. The handsome and hirsute Benicio Del Toro, (Lawrence Talbot) bears little resemblance to his screen father (Hopkins), which caused me to wonder if there might be another subplot? The story revolves about revenge for the untimely murder of brother Ben Talbot, inspired by urgent pleas to Del Toro from Ben's fiancee (Emily Blunt)...ergo...the prodigal son returns and oops...gets bit by a very powerful, hairy beast! Frequent windows to the past show the mysterious death of Sir John's wife, recalled in still gaps by the last remaining Taylor (Del Toro) who is now infected, viral, and uncertain about everything.

Del Toro has a confident stride, yet is extremely unconvincing as an actor playing an actor, conflicted by being a wolfman. I add a footnote about the proper English lady presence, that of Miss Emily Blunt---whose role is...well, blunt, seemingly mere decor, but believable in manner and bearing for a period piece. Of course Del Toro and Blunt fall for each other (no chemistry) and Hopkins penchant for stiff wood chairs with leather and chains is kind of kinky funny. The only actor who seems to be giving his all, Hugo Weaving as Inspector Aberline---alas, sadly there are too many obstacles for any one person to carry this movie...

The only joy in the movie, and maybe this is what they were going for, was the dismemberment and slaughter of a packed sardine court of pompous academia. If it could have been the House of Commons, i think we may have had a bit more camaraderie with the wolf. You find yourself waiting, and waiting for something to happen....the pace to pick up, the chemistry to click, the entertainment to begin...sorely, regrettably, a disappointment in all facets. The gifted actors and script is frequently referred to as ""cheesey"" by Blockbuster patrons surveyed. Not recommended...",1276905600,3,2102,5.054755043227666

This film was a Remake of the 1941 Classic starring Lon Chaney Jr. It offered the same story line but with a bit of a twist. This film however; had a much more darker atmosphere in it's scenery&the special affects were outstanding
with more of a up close & rather graphic view of the guts and gore. But it would not be the wolfman without his calling card. The story lines were good, and believable. Great action & very suspenseful. It made me jump a few times. Anthony Hopkins was outstanding as Lawrence's Father,and had a few surprises of his own to offer.

There was absolutely no chemistry between the Wolfman and his love interest; why the Scotland Yard inspector was there and what his role was is anybody's guess; the Wolfman's stay in the asylum was a joke, complete with the most cliche sadistic wardens and the dumbest psychiatrist (complete with German accent, of course) you can imagine.

They used that as well as good story  (though not exactly the same as the original it was really close),  great settings and good acting.

Benicio del Toro played a very good part. I truly enjoyed watching him and can say they made the right call. Anthony Hopkins did pretty well also.  Not great but good.

3601062,5,B001GCUO0W,"I feel very positively about The Wolfman. I watched it a total of three times over the weekend; twice for the extended version and once for the original theatrical version. Although I liked the extended version best, both versions were well worth the time. Even my wife, who doesn't like horror films, as a rule, really enjoyed The Wolfman and kind of gushed about it.
There was plenty to like about The Wolfman. All principal actors and every secondary actor in this film did very good jobs in their respective parts. All roles were very well cast and the actors made their characters come alive in the film, giving it all a sense of realism and believability. I especially enjoyed Hopkins and Weaving in their respective roles. There was even a small cameo part by Max Von Sydow that added to the rich quality of the cast and I wished they had extended his part in the film, just a little bit. This film was as deeply atmospheric as the original, if not more so. The musical score supported the theme of the movie very well and added to the sense of dread and foreboding of the story itself. And there were plenty of gothic horror elements that added tremendously to the overall enjoyability of this movie.
I thought that the special effects were very well done. I found the monsters and the way they moved realistic enough to allow the complete illusion they were designed to create. I also liked the fact that both creatures resembled the Werewolves from the original film, with Lon Chaney, Jt., but were updated enough to make them much more menacing and believable.
This movie was just great. Not perfect, of course, but excellent in many respects and worth my time for three viewings and I'm somewhat tough to please, lately. I see very few movies that satisfy me annymore, most just leaving a lot to be desired. But, this one was excellent and I gave it five stars to express my appreciation and to recommend it to horror fans, particularly and movie fans, generally.

The focus is definitely on a monster killing people. The movie goes to pains to find odd and grotesque situations in which to disembowel a lot of people. However, this gets pretty boring. The scenes are uniformly dark and the acting dull. Simon Merrells is catatonic and Anthony Hopkins comes across as a joke.

3601066,3,B001GCUO0W,"I found the beginning of this version dark and foreboding. It seemed as though the very atmosphere of the town of Blackmoor was cursed, rightly so as the story unfolds.  The credits list the film as based on the original screenplay by Curt Siodmak who wrote the original 1941 version; however, unless there were a lot of changes made before the 1941 version reached the screen I find this a dubious claim. This film is not so much a remake as a blending of elements from three films: Universal's The Wolfman and The Werewolf of London as well as Hammer's Curse of the Werewolf. Benicio Del Toro, dressed to the nines in period costume is a dead ringer for Oliver Reed's poor unfortunate Leone and the make-up, especially the other werewolf's appearance is very reminiscent of ""Curse"". In the role, Del Toro appears to strike similar features of both Reed and Chaney. This film borrows heavily from all three films: the wolf head cane, the chases on the moors and gypsies from the original; the make up and building roof climbing from ""Curse""; and the story of the mountain search, the confrontation of beasts and even the final bullet from ""London"". There are more comparisons you can probably draw, but it doesn't really matter as the film stand on its own quite well. Despite its slow and sombre beginning, when this film ramps up it really ramps up as more and more truths begin to unfold and we realize what's been happening the whole time. Although this film does display massive gore, the dark and low light setting leaves a lot of it to your imagination which enhances the attacks. I did find some of the more modern camera and transition techniques a bit jarring as they didn't seem to fit this period piece. They became more of an annoyance than beneficial at moving the story along. Elfman's music; however, suits this movie to a T.

I was amazed at the number of talented actors who appear in this film: Sir Anthony Hopkins, Emily Blunt, Del Toro, Art Malik as the manservant Singh, Geraldine Chaplain as the gypsy Maleva and Hugo Weaving (I was really amused when I learning of Weaving's character).  I have to admit I was a bit disappointed in Del Toro's performance. His Lawrence Talbot is rather understated. Given what the young Lawrence went through as a child and the adult Lawrence's discovery of his ""condition"", I would have expected a more tortured soul than Del Toro presents. Nonetheless, The Wolfman has enough to keep you interested until the final growl.",1276214400,3,2481,4.711981566820277
3601067,3,B001GCUO0W,"Benicio Del Toro is generally a fantastic actor, but you wouldn't know it from watching this.  His character is completely monotone, and you get the sense the actor is bored or sleepy throughout the whole movie.  Anthony Hopkins is a tad more lively, but his character is extremely one-dimensional and not especially interesting.

It's a shame, really, because the movie is visually stunning, with excellent production design and art direction by some of the people behind Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow"".  It sets a perfect gloomy, foggy atmosphere.

Somehow, the film never quite manages to convey the tragedy nor the horror of what's happening to its protagonist and his victims.  There's some gore, and a few startles, but even those are predictable, and the gore just feels gratuitous instead of frightening or disturbing.  Likewise for the CGI effects.  When is Hollywood going to learn that less is more when it comes to horror?

Danny Elfman's score was apparently inspired by the score for Coppola's 1992 Dracula.  It's a valiant effort and the themes are recognizable, but it's not Elfman's best work.  Somehow the music just doesn't unsettle or inspire the sense of dread that it should.",1276041600,6,1195,5.076923076923077

Sir Anthony Hopkins is in his usual psychotic role, Benicio Del Toro gives an adequate performance as Lawrence Talbot, Emily Blunt is the part of Gwen. The film is by no means perfect, a step higher than your run of the mill horror films of today - one flaw in the gypsy scene, the wolf is attacking the village running around killing, slicing, innocent victims one by one, the creature is moving at a velocity of a hundred miles an hour, as the camera zooms in, this thing is the size of a medium size dog, not big enough to be a ""wolf man"", obviously some bad camera work and effects. This and some overdone ""howling at the moon"" were basically the only flaws from this viewer. The plot is  different from the original, at the same time this new version is based on the same concept. ""The Wolfman"" is close to a newborn classic at least of the horror genre.

This is neither a spoof (like the recent ""Mummy"" films) nor a damned ""re-imagining."" (""Robin Hood"", anyone??) Benecio DelToro is the perfect actor to play Lawrence Talbot, Anthony Hopkins is more restrained than he was in Coppola's ""Dracula', and Emily Blunt recalls the great Hammer actress Barbara Steele. In fact, ""The Wolfman"" plays like a modern update on a Hammer film, with great visual design, an atmospheric score and smooth effects. It's scarier than the original Lon Chaney version, but still not all THAT scary. I wish they had included the extended chase through London in the Director's Cut. That was fun AND scary!

The diverse amount of shots and beautiful cinematography made this film so good. Personally I loved how this film held a feeling of Halloween. Most of the shots used ample amounts of fog to create and set the mood. Also it seemed this movie was shot in late fall giving it more of a creepy feeling.

Although the cinematography was the strongest part of this film, sound was also greatly used. The music and sound effects all added to the creepy feeling. The Wolfman himself was greatly designed, using a mix of CGI and costume, the Wolfman looked real, alive and quite scary.

I am giving this movie a 3.5 star rating. A movie that although is beautiful, still lacks in some areas. But no doubt this is definitely a movie to pop in the DVD player on a cool October night.",1275782400,3,899,4.475609756097561

The wolfman itself was very similar in style to the Lon Chaney Jr. makeup job...and although the original is considered corney by the standards of today, this new wolfman image is, again, very much like the original, but changed enough to make him ferocious and more to our modern tastes.

I can't say that I would have chosen Del Toro as Lawrence if I had the chance to cast, however, after a rocky start he really pulled it off.  Anthony Hopkins was once again, BRILLIANT.  I was almost seeing a little Hannibal L. in his portrayal of Lawrence's father, and it was intruiging, since Claude Raines was such a benign Mr. Talbot.  Anthony loved playing this part...it seems to suit his personality.

Visually, this movie was stunning. The scenes of Old London...the moors...just beautifully rendered.  The scenery was a bit unsettling out near the Talbot house and that is exactly what made it all work.  The house didn't have to be decaying, however, it suited the mood and went well alongside the obvious destruction of their family from the inside out.

Another great classic monster movie from Universal. I hope any further remakes of their classic monster line of films will be as respectful as this one to the film that came before.",1275782400,3,1445,4.725099601593626

dreaded creatures of the night.
They used alot of the old period story, but embellishments were
made here and there of course to update things slightly technology-wise,
while keeping that dark murky 19th Century British vibe intact.
Sir Anthony Hopkins plays Tolbert's father, who, as the film progresses,
reveals a few secrets of his own.  (-:
Visually, I found this movie entertaining enough...there's plenty of gore,
blood, disemboweled entrails, ripped out throats and ripped off heads!
But overall there was just something missing.....as in REAL PASSION in
the story-telling, acting, directing, editing. I watched the unrated director's
cut, which I assume is the director's unedited vision without interference
from the studio brass. But I'm afraid I wasn't terribly impressed!
IMO, this movie was another case of a good cast, good crew, otherwise good
producer and director, who somewhere got lost in the sauce and the film got
muddled in places. Other places are bursts of brilliance of what this film could've been.
Emily Blunt's character provides the softness and motherlove to the tragic
Laurence Talbot, and alas, is the one who delivers him from his
torment in the end. I must say the best scenes were towards the end
between Del Toro and Hopkins! Also, the scenes earlier in the gypsy camp
as well as in the asylum...KILLER!! (-:

3601107,4,B001GCUO0W,"Lycanthropy is 'in folklore, the magical ability to assume the form and characteristics of a wolf: it also describes a delusion that one has become or assumed the characteristics of a wolf or other animal'.  What makes this remake of the original screenplay circa 1941 by Curt Siodmak is the apparent respect for the 'delusional' aspect of the subject matter.  The setting for the film is Blackmoor England 1891 and the screen is filled with imagery so dark and dependent on candlelight that the underlying terror of the story is well set.  The story is known to everyone: Sir John Talbot (Sir Anthony Hopkins in a mesmerizingly  dissociative role) has a past that includes the loss of his wife by 'suicide' and the loss of his one son Lawrence (Benecio Del Toro, miscast here) to the land of America where he became an actor, never communicating with his family - the family now being solely his father and his brother Ben (Simon Merrels) along with Ben's affianced Gwen (Emily Blunt).  While Lawrence is playing 'Hamlet' in London, Gwen comes to Lawrence's dressing room to seek his help in investigating the recent murder of Ben.  Lawrence acquiesces and returns to the Blackmoor manor, much to the surprise of his strange father. As Lawrence  begins his search he is attacked by a werewolf and thus, by definition, he becomes cursed and is destined to live out his days as an occult monster who breaks into the werewolf mode at the full moon.  The story from there needs to be viewed instead of reviewed as what little story there is lies in the conclusion of this strange family.

The cast is strong - Hopkins is his usual master of acting, Blunt manages to create a credible character with the little material given her, Hugo Weaving turns in probably the best performance as an Inspector with insight about lycanthropy, and even Geraldine Chaplin glows a bit as the gypsy Maleva.  The cinematography by Shelly Johnson captures all the gory details of carnivorism and the stench of an insane asylum and Danny Elfman's musical score enhances the moods.  THE WOLFMAN is not a great movie, but it is a good period piece and a reminder of the original film that started the now overabundance of film on werewolves and vampires.

3601133,4,B001GCUO0W,"Wolfman is a remake of the Universal Classic. It tells the tale of Lawrence Talbot(Del Toro), who is lured back to his family estate by his brother's fiance Gwen (Blunt) after he goes missing. Reunited with his estranged father and haunted by his past, Talbot sets out to find his brother. After he is attacked, he soon discovers that something with brute strength and a lust for blood has been killing the villagers, and that a suspicious Scotland Yard inspector named Aberline (Weaving) has come to investigate. The curse of the wolfman begins and as he falls deeper into madness, he makes a startling revelation! Can he destroy the evil behind it all, before it destroys him?

This movie is getting high praise and serious criticism on here. It deserves neither. The critics are ridiculous and I wonder what they expected? The cast is excellent and the script (all things considered) original and refreshing. What fun would it be to see the original film remade frame by frame? Talbot is a more complete character with a haunted back story. The relationship with his father is the main storyline in the film, which gives it substance. I have not seen the theatrical but the problem with the Director's Cut is that it gores it up too much. Otherwise, this is an excellent remake and enjoyable movie.

3601135,1,B001GCUO0W,"I love horror movies.  The old ones, Bela Lugosi for example, and the new ones, Coppola's Dracula for another example.  And I love special effects.  The saving grace of 2012 and an amazing adventure in Avatar.  But here I witnessed not only one of the very worst recreations of an old Hollywood classic but I had the revised plot all figured out within 15 minutes.  No joke.  And I hoped I would be wrong.  I also love Anthony Hopkins and Benecio del Toro.  Academy award winners both for Silence of the Lambs and Traffic, respectively and those were great films.  But here Hopkins seems lost and preoccupied and del Toro acts as if he wanted to be anywhere else but on this film.  The original Wolfman featured the son of great actor Lon Chaney.  Lon Chaney, Jr. was never the star his father was but he made this creature his very own.  Even in Abbott and Costello's rendition of the horror monsters, Chaney did a wonderful job.

Now why could not Hollywood have done a good job with what is a great story.  Why?  The initial minutes of this remake are full of atmosphere and several scenes in the film are compelling.  But the story line is improbable and sophomoric.  The ending, which I won't give away, has some Freddy Kruger style ghoulish minutes.  The original story with Chaney is tight and well told.  This remake meanders here and there.  One wants to say ""Oh get on with it!"".

Some people will love this film.  That's what makes the world go round.  Different strokes.  But I wish I'd rented mine on pay per view.  I would have saved about $6.00.  I also wish this film, which I was looking forward to seeing, had been better.  The set up was perfect.  Great actors, most likely a generous budget, lots of FX.  Real potential to knock the story out of the park or at least make something as Coppola did which still resonates years later just like the original.

But a sad failure and I have today learned it did poorly at the box office too.  Hey Hollywood.  Pay attention.  It is possible to do a scarey film in modern times.  Just look at Ridley Scott's Alien or Cameron's sequel if you doubt it.",1275609600,9,2112,4.442408376963351

Two great actors such as Hopkins and El Toro should not be wasting there times is such cheesy roles, Hopkins as always is great(Even with what little he's given) and El Toro rants around like some lost kid searching for his mom. The movie is bland, predictable, and just plain silly in most parts. Changing into the wolf is quite impressive from a visual standpoint, its when he actually is the wolf thats a problem. He looks like a man, with a wolfman mask on, nothing more nothing less, hense i guess the name wolfman. I figured he would look more like a beast from movies like American Werewolf in Paris and even Neil Marshalls Dog Soldiers, which were both superior movies compared to this. Basically you go through the movie just watching him run from everyone and there is no ""real"" plot, more of a pseudo plot than anything else. There is no substance and no great dialogue to keep the movie in line and from losing direction after about 30 minutes into the film. The scenery about the only other plus, is great, very well done and locations properly choosen from castles down to the last spooky foggy light lighten forest. So the atmosphere some will appreciate, and thats all that i myself liked. So watch the movie and you decide, i just thought it was a remake of a remake and looked more like a beefed up, gorey version of one of the old films from the 50's or 60's, perhaps thats what they were going for?

The gore was blatant and didn't fall into a solid context of story. It was just kind of thrown at you.  Unlike other reviewers, I didn't buy Del Toros character at all.  Delivery was bad in the movie, and I don't see this one coming off the movie lover's shelf more than twice.  In fact the second viewing will probably only remind the viewer why it was sitting on the shelf so long since the last viewing.

He's made two movies that I'm quite fond of that are full of action, scares and laughs (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jurassic-Park-III/dp/B00003CXXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jurassic Park III</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jumanji/dp/B000031EGV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jumanji</a>), so I thought that with Johnston at the helm for The Wolfman, we might be in for more of the same. The trailer for The Wolfman sure made it seem like at least the action and the scares would be there, but ultimately I found The Wolfman very slow-moving and hardly scary.

For a ""monster movie"", I want a lot of monster. Johnston's Director's Cut runs for a full two hours, and I'd say that there's a monster(s) on screen for maybe about 25% of the two hours. The rest of the movie is a bunch of boring Benicio Del Toro lumbering around looking more like that character Anton Chigurh from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Country-for-Old-Men/dp/B0011BE3K0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Country for Old Men</a>&nbsp;than Larry Talbot. Except when Chigurh was on screen in No Country you paid attention, when mild mannered Talbot is on screen in Wolfman someone better be there to pinch you if you want to be awake when some action finally starts.

And surprisingly, with a cast that includes some other greats like Anthony Hopkins and Hugo Weaving, you'd think that a lack of action might be made up for by stellar acting. But if you ask me, those guys are miscast and gravely underused in The Wolfman.

The story line is also magnetic, your senses are assailed on several levels at the same time, and they all merge to provide the viewer with a authentic trip to the movies.

There are some similarities, such as the star's remarkable resemblance to Lon Chaney Jr., the names of the characters, the silver wolf's head cane, and the basic premise of the story.
Aside from those things, this new version of the Wolfman is an entirely new story.  For example, Sir John Talbot in the original is NOT a werewolf but a concerned father who actually has to kill his son at the end (with the silver cane!), and the werewolf did NOT go on a rampage in London.
I especially liked the ending where the Scotland Yard inspector ends up as a future werewolf (Whoever is bitten by a werewolf and lives, becomes a werewolf himself!), and the girl must kill the werewolf.  Again, that ending was taken from Universal's ""House of Frankenstein"" film...""A werewolf must be killed with a silver bullet fired by the hand of one who loves him"".
The SFX were outstanding, and the action without pause...all in all, a very enjoyable film even though a lot of the blood and gore is superfluious.",1275609600,4,1143,4.516908212560386
3601172,5,B001GCUO0W,"I am a huge fan of the classic horror movies.  So when I heard about this remake of THE WOLFMAN I so wanted to see it big screen.  Didn't get to, but I just finished watching it a few minutes ago on DVD.

The longer this movie went on, the more I found myself psychically talking to the producers and director and saying ""don't blow it - don't mess this up!""  They must have heard me, because they did it right - then the did it right some more - then they did it right some more - and finally they ended it right.

This is how Hollywood should remake the classics.  It's not a straightforward retelling, but it's not a total corruption/aberration either.  Instead it's a well thought out, visually delightful tale that honors the original, allows lycanthropy to maintain it's cursed nature, and offers some new treats as well.

It is fairly predictable, but in Gothic horror that is part of the horror.  You know what's coming.  You know the hero can't avoid what's coming.  The tension just increases.

The production design and visuals will please any fan of Victorian Horror.  Marvelous parquet floors, sweeping staircases, crumbling Abbeys, London by gaslight, and a gypsy campsite that was itself worth the price of the flick.  The shots in the woods of Blackmoor are incredible.  I could just watch the scenes with the torch-wielding villagers in the woods again and again.

If you like the old classics you'll probably like this (be warned it's heavier on the gore though).  If you need new, or
nudity, or vile language then you'll be disappointed.

If this crew decides to remake other famous monsters of filmland flicks they can rest assured I'll do my best to be at opening night.

3601174,5,B001GCUO0W,"Many Saturday afternoons were spent watching the old Universal monster movies. Lon Cheney and Bela Legosi, and of course Boris Karloff. How can these names have meaning to a guy born forty years after these films were released? They're classic, its really as simple as that.

I bought The Wolfman, sight unseen...never made it to the the theaters to see it. Yet, I still felt it had a lot to offer. I was hoping to rekindle that old love for classic horror. This movie does that.

What I liked about Benicio Del Toro as a choice for Lawrence Talbert, was simple. He reminded me a lot of Lon Cheney. The film is given it's icing on the cake with heavy hitters Anthony Hopkins, and Hugo Weaving. Hugo Weavings performance is just awesome, as in EVERY film he's been in that I've seen, he just makes the role that rounds out the cast and the film. He adds a familiarity to the inspector character.
Hopkins does a great job, and plays nearly a polar opposite to his VanHelsing in Dracula.

The period setting is awesome, and I preferred this turn of the century time setting. Interior shots are all fantastic, warmly lit and visually to much to take in during a first viewing. All the exteriors are great for this movie. My favorite shot is when Talbert, the morning after a transformation is under an overpass by London bridge. The location is dirty and loaded with texture, very well designed. The rain that falls is iconic London.

The musical score reminded me of Dracula, the 1990's version. It plays with somber notes, as to keep you sympathetic for Talbert, for me just as I had sympathy for Dracula in that 1990's version. Talbert, is a good guy who had something bad happen to him.

This movie is also never overacted, or filled with fake accents. Which I also liked, and is the ONLY thing that doesnt make the 1990's Dracula a five star experience for me.

A wolfman battle royale at the end is satisfactory, but a bit too short for me. Who is the lead wolfman? The cause of it all? Hmmmmm....Anyway, a fiery conclusion, complete with an old school mob with torches rounds out the last act of the movie. I find the lest few moments of the film worth more than the Wolfman smack down. It makes the flm more genuine, and has that depth of feeling that makes the viewers emotional investment worth it. I should also mention Emily Blunt does a great job, and I liked the understated love story.

3601179,4,B001GCUO0W,"The Blu-ray version of ""The Wolf Man"" includes both the Unrated Director's Cut and the choppy theatrical version. The Unrated version is a marked improvement over the choppy theatrical version of the film that we saw in theaters with better pacing and giving us a better understanding of the characters in the film (it's also a bit more graphic as well). Why studios continue to listen to preview audiences when deciding to re-editing a film (I can think of many films that later were seen as classics that suffered at the hands of studios...""Blade Runner"" anyone?)in a seamlessly branched edition with both versions. ""The Wolf Man"" looks marvelous with a sharp, detailed looking transfer.

Be aware however that I noticed a drop out in the sound at around the 1:30 mark it could be an isolated glitch but you may want to check your copy (and no it wasn't related to the player nor any dirt or debris on the disc as it happened at exactly the same spot. Could be something in the dual layer of the BD disc though). I didn't notice any other glitches and/or problems.

Director Joe Johnston creates an atmospheric film with terrific production values. While there are elements that don't work in the film (Benicio Del Toro and Emily Blunt have zero chemistry both do give good performances although Del Toro at times seems a bit miscast to me). The action sequences particularly the sequence set at an asylum in London are terrifically staged and directed. Is the film flawed? Most certainly although the ""Director's Cut"" eliminates many of these flaws and ""The Wolf Man"" remains a gory entertaining movie.

Actor Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro)returns home at the request of his brother's fiance to discover who or what mutilated and killed his brother. Long estranged from his father (Anthony Hopkins who chews the scenery quite ably), Talbot returns home reluctantly at first but becomes determined to find the creature stalking the locals. When Lawrence is attacked by the creature he becomes cursed becoming a monster when the full moon hangs high in the sky.

The Blu-ray has quite a bit in the way of special features focusing on the visual effects, make up and thoughts behind remaking the 1940 film. Included as part of the package here is the ability to stream the original film via BD Live (it would have been nice if they had included it on Blu-ray as an extra here)and it looks quite good (here's hoping a BD version will arrive soon).

""The Wolf Man"" is QUITE gory and as well as being an atmospheric film. While I'm not sure if it is a ""classic"" it is an entertaining if flawed film and the ""Unrated Director's Cut"" is far superior to the theatrical version even if it is only 16 minutes longer.

Benicio Del Toro stars as Lawrence Talbot, who upon his return to his ancestral home after the brutal death of his brother, finds himself at odds with his father (Anthony Hopkins) and yearning for his dead brother's fiance (Emily Blunt).  Before you know it, he is bitten by the beast responsible for his brother's demise, and it isn't long before the curse of the werewolf has befallen Lawrence as well.  Anything that The Wolfman offers is nothing that hasn't been seen before in just about any and all werewolf flicks to see the light of day since the original 1941 classic was originally unleashed.  There is a heaping amount of blood and gore effects to satisfy nearly any gorehound, albeit some of the CGI wolf effects leave quite a bit to be desired.  That being said, Rick Baker's prosthetic effects are spectacular, while the film's cinematography and set design pay wonderful homage to the original film.  Del Toro, who bears a striking resemblance to Lon Chaney, is good, but it's Anthony Hopkins, who delivers such a memorable, albeit hammy, performance.

3601213,3,B001GCUO0W,"In preparation for watching this WOLFMAN, a remake of the 1941 classic by the same name, I watched the original starring Lon Chaney, Jr. and Claude Rains. I think it is fair to compare the two movies because the new one is so obviously patterned on the original. It's clear that the director was not trying to remake the classic as much as he was trying to refresh it. To some extent, I think he succeeded. While the original had all the earmarks of a B movie, the new one has very high production values, adequate special effects, and top flight actors. But what the original had that the refresh does not is heart. When Lon Chaney Jr. learned what he had become, I believed in his remorse and fear of horrors he was bound to commit. Benicio del Toro does pronounce the same sort of fear, but I never felt it. It was more of a checking off of a box. The same is true of the father's character, although that was intentional and to say more would be a spoiler.

As I watched the new WOLFMAN, I kept waffling between liking it and being ambivalent toward it. After letting the experience settle for a few days, I've decided on ambivalence. There was really nothing about it that got me excited or fascinated or touched. So Lon and Claude can rest easy. They haven't been replaced yet.  In a perfect world, it would have been wonderful to see what Lon Chaney, Jr. and Claude Rains could have done with today's production values.  That would have been magical, I am sure.

3601214,3,B001GCUO0W,"A few years ago I took one of those Who is your Celebrity Match quizzes and Benicio Del Toro came up as my match. I was like, hmmm... A tortured, pretentious artist is my match, I can see it but at least he looked good.  Now 10 years later Benicio has completely let himself go which is fine because in Wolfman he's an Actor who returns home to find out what happened to his brother.  Wolfman is all about atmosphere and tone, which it gets mostly correct. Director Joe Johnston (Jurassic Park III, Hildago and the upcoming Captain America movie) does an interesting job of bringing that 60s horror vibe into the present. The movie looks just right, it's dirty, muddy, dank, like an old style classic horror movie would look if it was shot today. The problem is the story is boring and the acting is just terrible, especially Anthony Hopkins as Lawrence's father.  It took me 3 days to watch this disk because it kept putting me to sleep.

Picture and Audio Quality

There's not much to say on this front, the 1080p transfer is nice, sharp, clear. As mentioned earlier the cinematography on this is dirty and muddy so Blu-ray doesn't enhance the overall look and feel that much. I just didn't get a feeling that this is a movie that must be watched in Blu.

Extras

I love the extras on this disc. It includes a nice Picture In Picture mode that walks you through the making of the movie and includes an interactive timeline that gives you an in-depth look at the history of the Wolfman and information about the legend of the Wolfman. It also includes the ability to watch the original 1941 Wolfman Movia via BD-Live stream - how cool is that?  The disc includes both the Unrated and Theatrical version of the film (I don't know what the difference is between the two cuts).  There are deleted scenes, two alternate endings, several extended featurettes about the production.  Universal's  ""MyScene"" let's you create bookmarks. The only thing that annoys me is, they have ads now for upcoming movies or dvds as part of the menu. I can see a time when these ads turn into crap for things like coke products.

Presentation

I do love Universal's menu navigation system, it's clean and easy to use. The packaging is standard two disc with a slip case cover. All of the features are on the main disc, so no swapping - I'm lazy so this is always appreciated.

3601216,3,B001GCUO0W,"Being a big fan of the classic monster movie genre, I had been anticipating this film since it was first announced. Then it's release was delayed...then delayed again...and AGAIN for a third time.  Needless to say, I was concerned that it fell short of the studio's expectations, hence all the delays in the release date.  Unfortunately, my concerns were partially realized.  The acting performances were superb, however the story, arguably the MOST important part, fell just short of making this movie GREAT.  The sad part is that with a few tweaks to plot sequence and some additional scenes between Lawrence Talbot and Emily Blunt's character in order to create some much needed sexual tension and ""The Wolfman"" COULD HAVE BEEN one of the BEST modern remakes since ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"".  The most profound twist in the movie, *SPOILER ALERT* that Talbot Sr. was the original wolfman in the area who was responsible for the death of his son, was revealed remarkably early in the film and therefore didn't even allow audiences ample time to be aquainted with the cast of characters in order to even begin to ascertain the identity of the real perpetraitor.  And the lack of scenes between Emily Blunt(Larry's sister in law) & Larry Talbot to warrant them supposedly falling in love left no time for them to develop much chemistry. Some movies just have too many problems to fix, but ""The Wolfman"" was so close to being a fantastic film, that the problems were obvious and COULD HAVE BEEN corrected by the addition of just a few scenes and revealing the plot twist much later in the movie. Evidently these ""obvious"" problems weren't obvious enough to the director or to the studio, or were quite possibly brushed aside due to budgetary constraints.
On the positive, The Wolfman makeup, the cinematography and music were absolutely breathtaking and made for a visually & audibly stunning film. The mood and setting were horror movie making at it's finest and this combined with a stellar cast made for a beautifully macabre classic horror film that only lacked in the story telling. As much as I appreciate Joe Johnston's work, he left this movie short of classic.  I still plan to purchase this movie, but I can only wonder, WHAT IF?",1275177600,2,2236,4.868421052631579

I think it is easy to see the Lon Chaney version, but with enough differences to keep it interesting.  The greatest movie of the year??? IMHO no, but enjoyable none-the-less.",1275177600,2,476,4.780487804878049

So,lets not dwell on that. This movie is not a complete bore but it never really gets exciting either. The character development is pretty limited. We have this guy who goes back home because his brother is missing. His brother is then found dead. Later, the guy gets bitten and turns into a wolf. Then, we find out that his father is also a wolf and that he had murdered his son. It all sounds interesting enough. However, none of the characters seen really invested in the story. If you took out the scene where the 2 wolves are fighting this would not even be worth renting. Definately do not buy this one. It's not even worth it on blu-ray. Just rent it.

3601219,3,B001GCUO0W,"[THIS REVIEW REFERS TO THE THEATRICAL VERSION OF THE FILM]

After the brutal murder of his brother, Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) comes back to his family's Blackmoor estate, where his estranged father Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins) lives. The terrified villagers suspect that gypsies (or the bear they keep) are responsible for the deed, but on the full moon night the locals are to know the real culprit is out there in the woods - some mysterious creature that starts attacking people, killing them with its superhuman power.

As you know, this is a remake of the 1941 Universal horror classic ""Wolfman"" starring Lon Chaney, Jr. and Claude Rains, but the plot is considerably changed, presumably to allow for more special effects. I don't mind these changes as long as the film delivers the goods, but I am afraid that is not exactly the case here.

For all Rick Baker's special make-ups and effective production designs, the film remains largely thrill-free, due to the predictable script (originally penned by Andrew Kevin Walker, rewritten by David Self) and pretty ineffective storytelling that fails to build tension during the action scenes. One exception is the impressive observation room sequence in which a character strapped in a chair morphs into a werewolf, but the rest of the film is just OK. The romance is there, but Emily Blunt's heroine remains uninteresting, wasting any opportunity for her to show what she can do. Hugo Weaving, like he always does, steals every scene he is in, but his character itself is sadly underwritten.

This is the first work from director Joe Johnston since ""Hidalgo"" in 2004, whose ""October Sky"" is one of my favorite films. Though not totally a terrible film, ""The Wolfman"" has turned out a little disappointing, lacking a good story to tell.",1275004800,2,1802,4.976744186046512

3601271,2,B001GCUO0W,"The Wolfman
Synopsis:
Well, there are lots of trees, fog, and gypsies. There's a wolfman and he eats and bites people. That makes another wolfman. Hugo Weaving looks like a tool in his facial hair and Anthony Hopkins loves to wear animals skins. Bam! I just saved you two hours of your life!
Review:
This review is written while I watch this movie, so it's kind of random and rambling.
The Wolfman starts out a bit bloody, but surprisingly slow. I'm not quite sure if they were trying to build an old school tension or bore the audience to fear. Another scary aspect is that everyone in the movie seems to have a different accent. I spent the first 20 minutes trying to figure out if they were in Scotland, Ireland, England, or Fairyland. I then spent another 10 waiting for something to happen. This movie had such promise, I mean it's the story of the wolfman, you could do so many cool things with it. Or you could make a movie with lots of shots of trees and clouds. Yay scenery. :p
When the action does start, well the gore is very bloody and stylized and the animals very CGI'd. I kinda felt like they were spending their budget in all the wrong places. ""We don't need a believable looking bad guy, we need more fog and CGI houses!"" Underworld had much cooler and more believable wolves, so what does that say to you? Oh and did you know that gypsies train master surgeons? So if you ever get your throat ripped open, you should look for a gypsy caravan and not a doctor!
The first time you see Anthony Hopkins, he is wearing this sweet tiger smoking jacket/robe thing, I totally want one! There's nothing that says hot quite like a musky apex predator! Unfortunately, Benicio del Toro is one ugly guy. Some people may think he's rugged or something, but yuck he does not do it for me. Old Anthony is actually more attractive than he is. If a movie is going to be this slow, it's too bad they could get someone really attractive to stare at for two hours. :( Hugo is, well, Hugo. Love the voice, hate the mullet and chops!
And... I just realized we have another hour to go at this point. *sigh*
Oh good, the transformation, finally! So... Do you know what's not so cool? The sound of stuck cracking associated with the human body. Eww. Though I will say, he does have a sweet howl. There were a couple cool shots reminiscent of the original movie, but overall, the movie still managed to be boring while mauling people and scattering intestines. Nice, you know every time you think this movie can't get any worse, enter random weird editing and effects... and more intestines. Here's a question. Can you wear leopard print after Labor Day? Or is that only a summer fur?
The climax/conclusion of the movie is a bloody rampage interspersed with a bit more slow plot. The most entertaining point of the movie is the wolfman's attempt at public transportation. You'll see...

My Recommendation:
Skip it. Maybe watch it on TV. But if you want to watch a werewolf movie, watch An American Werewolf in Paris instead, as it's a fun romp where you don't spend your time waiting for something to happen. I mean when the director tells you that he took 17 minutes out of the original version to ""get to the first wolfman transformation"" which happens over an hour into the film, that's not a good sign for excitement.",1274313600,,3312,4.492537313432836
3601272,4,B001GCUO0W,"I'm going to be honest right now, I have a large bias toward The Wolfman. The original is without a doubt my favorite movie. Lon Chaney Jr. in that classic makeup has scared the crap out of me for almost 20 years now. With that in mind, I walked into that theater knowing I would receive this film positively. I did. Is it perfect? Most definitely not. Not even close. But it is definitely fun, a treat for modern and classic horror fans. I'm going to assume now that those of you reading this review have seen the movie, so there will be minor spoilers following this. If you have not, please skip this and come back when you have. I'd hate to ruin it for you. The move from 1940s England to 1890s England was genius. The Victorian Era in London was the epitome of high society, the burgeoning frontier of the modern scientific age. It was a time ruled by class and logic, where the bogeymen of the past were returning to the shadows and nightmares whence they came. It is perfect to throw in the supernatural, primal creature that is the werewolf. No class, no reason, no logic, just carnage personified. It is perfect proof that not all bogeymen are imagined, and that people may not be as civilized as we'd like to believe. The inclusion of Rick Baker in designing the effects was a stroke of genius as well. While his exact vision may not have made it to the screen, enough of it shines through to make the Wolfman something special. The first time I saw it on the screen I was reminded of the original Lon Chaney makeup and how petrified I was when I was smaller. I'm grown up now, and while it did not scare me, it did leave me in awe over what an achievement it was. It was a worth successor to the original's wolfman, not just in design but the fact that benicio del toro was the man behind the wolf. he is a huge fan of the original as well, so one could trust that it would be done right. the shortcomings of this film are largely in the script. the production was very tumultuous and it is evident. the enthusiasm is there, but without a proper script as a backbone it goes limp. I could go on and on, but if i haven't convinced anyone to give this a first or second glance by now, nothing i say will. I give 5 stars to the makeup and the acting, 3 to the overall story, 2 1/2 in the execution of the story, 1 for the closeups of the wolfman running (i still shudder when i think about those moments. luckily there were only 2 or so.), and i give the movie 4 1/2 stars overall. I doubt that's totally fair but as i said at the beginning, i'm biased. see the wolfman. have a good time. i know i did.",1274140800,4,2610,4.190854870775348

Del Toro is grievously miscast.  I've seen sixth grade kids performing in school plays who can deliver lines more believably (the death scene was out-loud laughable).  Even Anthony Hopkins, an extraordinary talent, couldn't save this mess.  And how sad and unnecessary ... with CGI technology and industry advancements, and a few serious rewrites on the script, this project could have seriously pushed the envelope and turned some heads.

//Original review:

Before I saw this movie, I had read some pretty varied reviews about it, so I wasn't really sure of what to expect. I was quite happy with what I found, however.
First, I will list my impressions, and then I'll discuss the story (without too many spoilers, I hope :P). This is a dark film, and it can really immerse you. It is a bit gory, but you get so wrapped up in what's going on that it seems more like it belongs than not -- particularly as a counterbalance to the desire of the viewer to preserve (one of) the wolf-folk involved, as it shows just what devastation he causes. (Although, for viewers with kids, it's more than you'd probably want young ones watching.) The characters were well crafted, and -- even the very eccentric ones -- seemed believable. There were only one or two times, for me, when things seemed a little too ""over the top"". As far as casting, I thought it was perfect; Del Toro's Lawrence Talbot is perfectly dark and tragic; Emily Blunt's Gwen is ideal; Hopkin's Sir Talbot is perfectly monstrous (but in a good way!); Weaving's Inspector is equally well done; and the various superstitious/prejudiced/frightened villagers were superb in their roles.
Alright, on to the story -- and be warned, there will be **spoilers** here, although I will try to keep them to a minimum.

The story revolves around Lawrence Talbot, who receives a letter from his (recently dead) brother's fiance, Gwen Conliffe. He returns home to learn about his brother (Ben Talbot)'s death; the death of his brother aside, this is not, as you learn later (and guess immediately, by Del Toro's expressions), a pleasant return. His father -- who sent him to an asylum as a child after he witnessed the grisly death of Lady Talbot -- is morbidly distant and unconcerned, but Gwen is genuinely grieved and searching for answers. Ben's death was not only a murder, but a particularly gruesome one, and Gwen asks Lawrence to help find the killer. He sets out to do so.
Ben was torn to shreds in an inexplicable manner and left in a ditch, although some of the villagers ""explain"" the death by attributing it to a dancing bear that travels with some gypsies who have set up camp nearby, and others attribute the death to the work of a madman. Lawrence finds a clue that points him toward the Gypsies, so he goes to speak with them. It just so happens that -- you guessed it -- the night that he rides out is the night of a full moon.
Lawrence's investigative work is cut short by a werewolf attack on the camp; and Lawrence ends up with a life threatening wound. Gwen stays at the Hall to tend him. After a length of time, this wound rather miraculously heals; the doctor who attends Lawrence is stunned by this fact, and Lawrence is not a little surprised himself.
The next full moon arrives, and Lawrence -- seeing his father sneaking to his mother's crypt -- follows. He proceeds into a dungeon-ish room, where Sir Talbot locks himself away after a cryptic warning.
Lawrence witnesses part of his father's transformation, and turns into a werewolf himself; he proceeds to run about doing werewolf-like things (you know, ripping people to shreds and other such naughty behaviors) before collapsing/returning to human state on his father's property.
Lawrence is captured and taken back to the asylum, where he is tortured -- as well as taunted by his father who comes to ""visit"". Sir Talbot, when Lawrence suggests that he kill himself, declares that he will certainly not, but instead plans to keep letting the wolf take over rather than hiding every full moon in the dungeon. He also reveals that it was he who killed Ben after an argument and a bout of drinking, as well as reveals how he became a werewolf -- and the truth about Lawrence's mother's death.
The asylum incarceration continues until that full moon, when the werewolf emerges again and breaks free (destroying all that gets in his path). After returning to his human state, Lawrence seeks temporary refuge with Gwen, and then heads back to Talbot Hall to confront his father.
Gwen, meanwhile -- her and Lawrence's relationship having progressed from mutual grief at Ben's death to love -- seeks out a cure for lycanthropy -- and races to get to Lawrence before harm (or the redoubtable inspector, who has been doggedly tailing him from early on) finds him.
All of this leads to a hair-raising search through the ghoulish manor, a terrific fight, and a sad but necessary end -- with an interesting catch.

All in all, to reiterate, I thought the movie was very well done, with only a few things I would have liked changed. The acting was excellent, with only two or three lines of Del Toro's that I think could have been done better -- but, otherwise, his work was absolutely superb.
Wolfman is probably not a good one for youngsters because of the dark story and gore, but otherwise darkness/gore was appropriate.
It is not a work of genius, but all the pieces fit together very well, and stand up to scrutiny.
Finally, I would also like to note that some of the objections to Wolfman centered around the romance between Gwen and Lawrence -- namely, that there wasn't ""more"". I disagree; remember that Gwen is sincerely grieving Ben's death, and this romance is ""accidental"". If Gwen and Lawrence found themselves ""in love"" immediately -- or soon after -- one would be disinclined to think much of Ben and Gwen's bond, or of the character of either fianc or brother. So, I think it was well done -- a natural, ""accidental"" progression.

All in all, a very good film.",1272931200,3,6157,4.629460201280878

The effects, the music and acting was great. And don't get me started with the transformation. Wow. Just Wow.. even the teeth separate and change!

3601280,3,B001GCUO0W,"The Wolfman is supposed to be a horror film but instead comes off as boring, predictable and not terrifying in the least. While the gothic atmosphere surrounds the entire film, the poor editing and lackluster acting really demotes The Wolfman. Benicio Del Toro is actually pretty bad in this. I can't tell if he is acting at all, which in this case, is not a good thing. He just sort of snarls some times and attempts to emote at other times, but it just wasn't working. Anthony Hopkins does slightly better, but his role is sadly underutilized and he can barely make an impact. Hugo Weaving is completely wasted here, a shame really as his acting has a broad range and he really didn't exibit any of it in this film. Emily blunt is subtle and sweet and while I liked her character, again, she just felt out of place.

I mentioned the editing and UGH is it terrible. It jumps from scene to scene, from plot to plot and from one geographical area to a completely unknown one in bursts that it's extremely confusing at various times. There is no proper path from beginning to end, no direction of any kind. They tried to mix a mythical mystery with a love story and in the end it turned out to be a jumbled mess. I loved the dark, sort of spooky, grainy atmosphere and the costumes are always nice to look at, but, combined with the weak, barely-there plot, it was just a huge let-down. You can't call this a horror since there is nothing frightening about it and it's not really a drama since you really feel nothing for any of the characters.

To this day I believe the most impressive werewolves in any film, are those in An American Werewolf in Paris. However, those were computer generated. After having seen Universal's The Wolfman, I found the version of it's creatures to be the best make-up effects of any werewolf I have ever seen. The film uses both CGI and make-up effects and did stellar jobs at both. I have my fingers crossed for an Oscar nom or two.

If you want a cool looking werewolf in your movie, there's really only one man to call: Rick Baker. This is no wonder as he has won a whopping six Oscars out of the 11 for which he was nominated. He's done make-up for Eddie Murphy movies on several occasions and his list of Oscars includes The Grinch, Men in Black, The Nutty Professor, Ed Wood, Harry and the Hendersons and of course An American Werewolf in London. He's also done make-up for some of the best werewolf films to include The Howling, Wolf, Cursed and now The Wolfman.

2010's The Wolfman will not disappoint werewolf junkies, like me. Whether you prefer upbeat horror flicks that are filled with blood and gore, or if you're prone to the old-school story driven style of the 30s, 40s and 50s horror classics; this film will satisfy your needs. It's essentially a beautiful collaboration of both tastes.

It pains me to report that I missed the first few opening seconds of the film, as I walked in just in time to see the film's magnificent title page. I'm told however, that it opens with the killing of a man by a savage beast. Big shocker, I know, but this sets up the entire film. We begin in London in 1891, which is a terrific setting for this film if you ask me.

Benicio Del Toro stars as Lawrence Talbot, the brother of the film's first of many victims. Lawrence's dead brother's fiance Gwen is played wonderfully by Emily Blunt. Gwen begins writing to Lawrence who has been living in America, in hopes that he will return home to assist her in finding his brother who has gone missing. Honoring her request, Lawrence returns home only to discover that his brother has become lunch to something unbearable.

In addition to starting up a subtle romance with his dead brother's girl, Lawrence also makes an effort to rekindle the relationship with his bizarre father, Sir John Talbot. The legendary Anthony Hopkins (who was also in Bram Stoker's Dracula) plays Sir John and is terrifyingly convincing. He harvests a dreadful secret and creeps around his dark and lonely mansion by candlelight.

Lawrence begins seeking answers in regards to his brother's death and eventually finds some. By ""finds some"", I mean he's bitten by a werewolf and slowly but surely begins to put two and two together, umkay. Lawrence begins having disturbing visions and develops a heightened group of senses. I don't think it's any huge secret, that he turns into a freakin' werewolf and starts slaughtering people, arousing suspicions; so let's just jump ahead and discuss what was done well and what wasn't, shall we?

The new film offers several entertaining moments between Lawrence and his father, that weren't found in the original. It also adds some suspense and originality with Hugo Weaving playing a detective hell bent on stopping the creature, after his decorated failure of tracking down Jack the Ripper. These were all pluses, but they may be what caused the relationship between Gwen and Lawrence to fall short of what we saw in the original version. There just isn't enough build-up for their feelings to be warranted; especially considering that they have the mutilated body of a loved one, as a token of what brought them together in the first place.

I kind of have mixed feelings about Del Toro's performance. I think he's a good actor and has the perfect look for the character of Lawrence. I liked that he played Lawrence differently than Lon Chaney Jr. did in the original. In that film, Lawrence was a bit of a comedian, and a happy chap, so it was a nice twist when his fate was sealed. Here, Del Toro plays him as a man with an already tortured past, having witnessed the death of his mother. I just didn't feel like Del Toro conveyed the emotion of the character to the extent that I know he could have, based on his previous work. The scenes between him and Gwen were the most notable of this.

The transformation scenes were awesome; a great combination of special effects and make-up effects. Nothing looked phony and we see a few things we've never seen in any werewolf transformation before. I loved seeing the wolfman terrorize the streets of London. I could have done without the close-up superhero shots of him galloping though, and Roger Ebert had an interesting point: the creature moves around like he is weightless. He should not have bounced around the screen like an out of control pin ball.

It's not that the gore was offensive or in bad taste; it's just that it seemed to be there for the sake of being there. It could have been spread out a little more or toned down. It was too hyped up is I guess is what I'm trying to say. The suspense of not knowing where the creature was and then seeing his claws rip someone to shreds from the darkness, was more satisfying. Or hearing him howl from off in the distance, or even seeing a flicker of him in the moonlight, running between the trees.

The sets were phenomenal. It reminded me of the exquisite detail that went into those of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. We were never on a fake movie set; we simply drank some magic Kool-Aid and traveled back to an 1891 London.

While I wasn't satisfied with the end of the ending (as in literally the last thing that takes place before the credits), with either version of the film, the climax in the middle of act three of this installment was one of my favorite moments. What takes place has been and will continue to be criticized by many. I found it very entertaining and I think it could have easily been cheesy but never was.

The screenplay was no-doubt a good one. It was co-written by one of most talented screenwriters in Hollywood, Andrew Kevin Walker, who has hand-crafted for us, some of the best horror thrillers ever made: Se7en, Sleepy Hollow, Brainscan and 8mm.

Director Joe Johnston has helped directors everywhere in regards to not being type-cast to one particular genre of filmmaking. Going from directing Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, to Jurassic Park III to The Wolfman, it's clear he can do it all.

The film could have been a little better, yeah; but it certainly could have been a lot worse. It's a ton of fun, and will give you some chills. Nobody does horror films like Universal Studios and it's good to see them re-planting seeds to successful crops of their glorified past. Universal is by far my favorite studio, and werewolves are my absolute favorite movie-monster, so, there is really probably no way I wasn't gonna like this film.",1271203200,4,7231,4.660910518053376

3601327,4,B001GCUO0W,"""The Wolfman"" is a welcome remake. That is, it is an excellent version that does not diminish the luster of the original, but is its own story, and one well told.

Benicio del Toro stars as Lawrence Talbot, who returns to England at the request of his brother's fiance. The brother has gone missing, and the young woman, played by Emily Blunt, has requested Talbot's help in finding him. By the time Talbot returns to his ancestral estate, he finds that his brother is dead, one of several murders committed by some kind of animal or murderous lunatic. He also finds his estranged father, played by Anthony Hopkins. Both Talbots are still devastated over the death of the younger Talbots mother that happened when Lawrence was a little boy. Lawrence sets out to find his brothers murderer, and while visiting a nearby gypsy camp, he survives an attack by a murderous creature. During the next full moon, well...you get the idea.

The Wolfman has very solid performances, particularly by Anthony Hopkins as the elder Talbot, Ms. Blunt as the grieving young woman who begins to fall in love with del Toro, and Hugo Weaving, who plays a Scotland Yard detective investigating the murders, and who is based off of the real-life detective who pursued Jack The Ripper. del Toro also gives a fine performance, and Rick Baker does his normal sensational job with makeup-special effects. This film should be enjoyed by classic horror movie fans.",1269907200,4,1435,4.853061224489796
3601328,3,B001GCUO0W,"It took seven decades for Universal to dust off Curt Siodmak's screenplay from the 1941 horror classic The Wolf Man and give us the 2010 version, directed by Joe Johnston (Jurassic Park III, Jumanji) and re-titled The Wolfman, but it would have been better if the script had been left on the shelf, dust and all.

Considering the advances in movie making since the 1940s, I would expect the new release to be more sophisticated, and to its credit it succeeds visually with eye-popping special effects. However, the story of the prodigal son's return home only to be bitten by a werewolf and then becoming one himself is no more innovative or scary than the outdated original.

While the original takes place in 20th century Wales with Lon Chaney Jr. playing the lead character Larry Talbot, Johnston's version takes place in 1891 Victorian England, where estranged son Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) returns to his ancestral home at the urgent request of his missing brother Ben's fianc Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt). When he arrives at the cobweb covered Talbot Hall, his aloof father, Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins), greets him with the news that he's a day late. Ben's mutilated body has already been found in a ditch, apparently attacked by an insane human or wild beast.

Against his father's wishes, Lawrence sets out for the local gypsy camp to find answers about Ben's death. While he is at the camp, a werewolf attacks, leaving a trail--or rather, entrails--of gypsy body parts in its wake.  Concerned about a young gypsy boy who wanders out of the camp, Lawrence follows the boy and is attacked by the werewolf.  A group of gypsies arrive in time to ward off the beast, but Lawrence has already suffered a mortal wound.

An old gypsy woman, Maleva (Geraldine Chaplin), sutures the wound and returns the nearly dead Lawrence to his father, but not before pronouncing him cursed and uttering Siodmak's famous line, ""Even a man who is pure in heart and says his prayers by night may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright."" Lawrence miraculously recovers and by the next full moon he is disemboweling and dismembering his own victims.
Screenwriters Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self take viewers through a few more twists and turns than there are in Siodmak's version, such as Lawrence's stint in an insane asylum and a lethal family secret.  There is more blood and gore in this film, as well, but the violence doesn't add to the suspense or fright factor; it just gives the movie an ""R"" rating, a first for Johnston.  After all, what else would you expect from a werewolf? And that's the problem: it's predictable.

Johnson updates the realism by employing legendary special effects artist Rick Baker (An American Werewolf in London), certainly coming a long way from Lon Chaney's primitive glued-on yak hair, but the effects are embedded in basically the same cheesy 1941 story.  The eye-popping transformation scenes, complete with bones re-arranging, hair sprouting and razor sharp claws emerging, and the gruesome attack scenes with more viscera, mutilation and beheadings than some will be able to stomach don't fit with campy lines like, ""I didn't know you hunted monsters"" and ""Sometimes monsters hunt you!""

Incidentally, Johnston also updates the werewolf howls, but with digital technology no one will notice that the sounds come from an opera singer and an old rock star, Gene Simmons. What is noticeable, though, is that all the technology in the world doesn't make up for a weak story.",1269648000,5,3543,4.917922948073702
3601329,4,B001GCUO0W,"Armed with an alarmingly suspenseful trailer, Benecio Del Toro and Anthony Hopkins as leads, and a solid foundation of horror history to carry the major weight, this movie looked like a can't miss home run.  I can't say all expectations were met, but for those who know what they're looking for, entertainment is still possible.

To start with, the two leads do not disappoint.  Both carry their scenes competently enough, but don't attempt to overwhelm.  I'd go so far as to say that Del Toro's interpretation of Lawrence Talbot, and the subsequent morose delivery - while normally suited for his roles - doesn't always fit the scene.  Nonetheless, the acting is one of the positives of the film, with Art Malik (the antagonist in True Lies) and Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith, Matrix) rounding out the cast.

Estranged family member Lawrence returns home after receiving correspondence about his brother's death of unknown cause.  The only thing known is that his brother was gashed open with unrecognizable claw marks, and his brother's beautiful widow is still hanging around the English mansion - a lavish Victorian monstrosity with enough grandeur fitting of the time and position, and enough moaning floorboards and ten-foot cobwebs to make it spooky - with Lawrence's reclusive father, Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins), a man with a shady (some say cursed) past to say the least.  Commence with the investigation into the brother's death, the increasingly revealed werewolf, and the ""twist"" ending that, when put together, gets a little long in the tooth.

The cinematography is predictable but good.  Tons of dark, cloudy nights with impossibly bright moons looming dangerously.  The full moon appears often enough to get an IMDB page.  Similarly, the story sticks to tradition, adding in very good special effects befitting of a big budget movie.  Yet, it's not outstanding.  And therein lies the problem.  Nothing stands out, and there was very little in the way of character connection.  Add in a pointless, inappropriate romance, and result is a somewhat hollow overall feeling.

Pretty simply, go into this movie with the understanding that the filmmakers intended to stay true to the werewolf lore and its tragic similarities and to Shakespearean literature, straying as little as possible to avoid the recent Hollywood habit of raping traditional perspective.  Do that and you'll have a good time.  Expecting the Wolfman to live a life happily after, and you'll be disappointed.

3601369,5,B001GCUO0W,"This is a fantastic movie!  I must admit, I was worried that it was going to become another ""My Bloody Valentine""..... all flash and no substance.
 Not the case. This film has a very good story, and frankly, it is even more interesting than the original Wolf Man story from the classic 1941 (I think) film.

 The scenery is beautiful, and spooky. Especially awesome was the panning of the film images from the moon down through the trees at the beginning of the movie, and vice versa at the end. Great images that signal that a classic good 'ole horror story is about to unfold before the audiences eyes.

 The British fog, thicker than a pint of stale bitters, was also done with great effect. Some say ""too much fog"" was used. People, we're talking about ENGLAND. It gets foggy. Couple that with the fact that it's a HORROR movie...the fog was not overdone...it added to the spooky effect just fine, thank you.

 Benicio Del Toro was great as Lawrence Talbot, the unfortunate good guy who, against his will, transforms into a monster when the moon is full.
 In some scenes, Del Toro actually looked like Lon Chaney, the fantastic actor who portayed the original Wolf Man.

  Emily Blunt......try not to fall in love with her by the movie's end....you'll be hard pressed not to. Blunt portrays Gwen Conliffe (spelling may be wrong on ""Conliffe"") the beautiful, delicious, widow of Talbot's brother, Ben, who was killed by the Wolf Man. Slowly, Conliffe, realizes that Lawrence, like his brother Ben, has some very noble, dignified similarities. And some unfortunate similarities also, regarding ""relations"".
  You cant help but to feel what Conliffe feels at the end of the movie.....she is ""Damned if she does"" and ""Damned if she doesnt"". You cant help but feel for her, and with her, as her emotions jump through the movie screen.
  Did I mention that Conliffe is beautiful?  Delicious?  Okay..just wanted to be clear on that. (Ms. Blunt, if you're out there, please..... call me. No, j/k. I hope that you and your Fiancee have many happy years together.)

  Hugo Weaving plays to perfection, the role of the Scotland Yard investigator, who gets the UN-enviable assignment of having to solve the Wolf Man mystery (He's used to sickening, difficult cases, having worked on the ""Jack The Ripper""
  case a couple of years back.

  Anthony Hopkins...what can one say of his performance as Sir John Talbot, father of Lawrence and Ben? The man gives you the creeps,even when he is being nice in the movie. Hopkins carries out his role, and the twist that his character is involved in, to perfection.

  This movie features fantastic perfomances, an interesting story with a stunning twist, beautiful scenery (It's hard not to get a chill up and down your spine when The Wolfman leaps onto the concrete statue and howls at the moon, with the city in the distance.)

  I enjoyed it alot, and I'm going to say something that many ""film purists"" will have to go to therapy in order to deal with, so I apologize in advance: I Enjoyed the classic 1941 Wolfman movie, but I enjoyed this movie far more than I did the classic.
 Yeah, I said it. I'll say it again. I think that this movie is more enjoyable than the original.

 To be sure, the movie does have it's share of disgusting, bloody scenes that would make John Rambo cringe. It's alot like Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow"".....if you can get past the gore, you'll enjoy the movie.
 But it is fully supported by awesome action scenes of The Wolfman leaping out of a hole in the ground, leaping onto rooftops, running on all fours (a ""realism"" that wasn't present in the classic film) and again, stunning images that far exceed the original movie, when it comes to spooky grandeur and just plain fun.
 It's BIGGER than the original film....you feel a part of the film more. The original, although a classic that I love, looks light years behind this movie when it comes to imagery, and action scenes. Such is the advantage of the digital age I guess.

 But,when you get right down to it, why must we compare the two movies?  Why cant we enjoy the original 1941 film, and enjoy this 2010 update as well?

 Why must it be ""either or""?  They are both awesome films, both will make you feel like it's Halloween. On any day of the year. Both films having been made with the same passion for story telling and exciting audiences that the talented filmmakers at Universal have exhibited.

  I cant wait for the DVD....rumor has it, it will be an ""Extended Edition"" with 17 minutes of footage not seen in theaters. I HOPE that they will also include the Original Theatrical Version as well. I guess I have that ""film purist"" in me a bit, also. But I don't want the version that I thoroughly enjoyed in theaters to be screwed with. Star Wars fans can relate.

  In summary, forget about the armchair experts who are on TV or in newspapers....the only film expert that matters is YOU. See for yourself. Decide for yourself.

  As for me, I give it two hairy thumbs/two hairy paws up, sky high....all the way to the moon and beyond..

3601370,4,B001GCUO0W,"Since vampires are the chic supernatural creature of the moment, it's nice to see werewolves getting some love. And despite being based loosely on the classic monster movie, ""The Wolf Man"" is  surprisingly well-made and suspenseful horror-action story, draped in grey light, decayed backdrops and a growing sense of tragedy. Think of this as the ""anti-Twilight.""

Lawrence Talbot (Benecio del Toro) receives a letter from his brother Ben's fiancee Gwen (Emily Blunt), telling him that Ben has vanished. By the time he arrives, his brother's body has been found.

However, the body was so horribly mutilated that Lawrence is determined to figure out what killed his brother (especially since coming home has triggered some nasty flashbacks to how his mom died). While investigating Ben's last days at a local gypsy camp, Lawrence witnesses dozens of being people slaughtered by a monstrous wolflike creature. When he tries to kill it, it bites him -- and he nearly dies of blood loss and fever.

Fortunately, Lawrence quickly heals from his wounds. But Scotland Yard's Inspector Aberline (Hugo Weaving) and the local villagers suspect that Lawrence himself either is a deranged maniac, or has acquired the curse of the ""beast"" (especially since he's completely healed). And on the night of the full moon, Lawrence discovers that there's some truth to those wolf-man superstitions -- and that his curse comes from someone very close to him.

Ivy-draped crumbling mansions, grey skies over the moors, rainy London streets, misty stone circles and a forest haunted by a beast-man (or two). ""The Wolf Man"" is soaked in gloomy gothic atmosphere from beginning to end, until you almost feel like choking on all the gloom and greyness. In fact, the entire movie is like that -- it's SO relentlessly dark that it could give you SADS.

And the storyline matches the gloomy atmosphere. Director Joe Johnston swings between haunting gothic suspense and gory gutsplattering action; the actual werewolf isn't very scary looking, but all the bloody dismemberment and lightning-fast attacks ARE very scary. To top it off, Johnston peppers the story with spooky flashbacks and some eerie hallucinations popping up to scare us out of our seats (including a wolf-boy who looks like Gollum). Fortunately Johnston also inserts some quiet, romantic moments for Gwen and Lawrence, especially that adorable stone-skipping scene.

Downside? The asylum tortures and the whole ""audience"" scene were flashy and silly, and it feels like they were tacked in there for MGP (Maximum Gore Potential). Fortunately the movie settles back into its groove once everyone returns to Blackmoor, just in time for a harrowing climax of silver bullets, fire, and family strife.

As for the actors, the movie rests on a solid square of them -- Benecio del Toro is a truly brilliant, tragic protagonist, whose entire life is turning into a nightmarish spiral of death and misery. Blunt is a delicate English rose with a core of steel; Anthony Hopkins is heartily creepy as del Toro's sociopathic dad. And Hugo Weaving is, as always, brilliant as a hard-edged inspector who is determined to bring down Lawrence no matter what he is (""We wouldn't have any silver bullets?"").

""The Wolf Man"" is a solid antidote to the drippily romantic werewolf/vampire stories out now -- it's grey, gothic, monstrous and ultimately heartrending. A solid horror movie, but rather heavy to digest.",1268092800,2,3432,5.158273381294964
3601371,4,B001GCUO0W,"As long as I can remember I have always been a fan of werewolf films.  From the good (""An American Werewolf in London"") to the mediocre (""Silver Bullet"") and from the funny (""Never Cry Werewolf"") to the just plain bad (""Cursed""), I've seen just about every werewolf film that's been put out.  Of all of them, I've yet to see one come close to matching the greatness of 1941's ""The Wolfman.""

Hoping to revive one of its legendary monsters, Universal offers up 2010's ""The Wolfman,"" a remake loosely based on the 1941 Lon Chaney, Jr. classic.  It features Benicio del Toro as Lawrence Talbot, Sir Anthony Hopkins as Lawrence's father, Sir John Talbot, Emily Blunt as Gwen Conliffe, and Hugo Weaving as Scotland yard inspector Francis Aberline.

While the basics of the original story are all there, such as Lawrence returning home to investigate his brother's violent death, the curse of the werewolf, frightened villagers, and a band of traveling gypsies, the rest of the tale varies greatly.

In this version, Lawrence returns home with a damaged past.  After apparently witnessing his mother's suicide as a child, he is placed in an insane asylum for a year and then shipped off to America to live with relatives.  While acting in London, he decides to make a side trip home to find out what has happened to his brother who has gone missing.  When the grisly details are revealed, he starts looking for his brother's murderer.

His investigation leads him to a group of gypsies where, unfortunately, he finds hiimself in the middle of a werewolf attack.  He survives the attack, but fans of the original know all too well what happens next.

From here, he sets out to find the werewolf that has cursed him and also tries to find a cure.  Without revealing too much else, just know that Lawrence's story is changed quite a bit from the original film.

While I liked many of the changes that were made to the original, I felt that director Joe Johnston fumbled the ball numerous times with these alterations.  Johnston added a bit of arthouse flavor to many of the transition scenes in the film, and spent a lot of time on flashbacks that, while not taking away from the basic plot of the film, didn't add much either.  Some of them were downright boring.

The film was also very predictable.  From the beginning, I figured out who the real villain was and what would most likely happen.  While this did not ruin the film for me, it would have been nice if Johnston wouldn't have made the story so obvious right out of the gates.

Johnston did get the atmosphere correct, initially giving the film a dark, gloomy and terrifying edge and then turning it into a desperate race for a man who hates and fears what he has become.

Benicio del Toro does a pretty good job as Lawrence.  His performance is very subdued until his character starts to mentally unravel.  Sir Anthony Hopkins did a very good job as well, but I've seen him give much better performances in other films.  Emily Blunt delivers the goods each time we get to see her despite having a somewhat limited role.  The other primary player in this story, Aberline (Weaving), seems a bit over the top, but still fun to watch.

The highlight of this film is the Wolfman himself.  Rick Baker's make-up is brilliant.  He updated the original make-up from Jack Pierce's 1941 creation, but kept all of the classic's primary appeal.  When you see the Wolfman on the screen, you know you're seeing the classic in all his glory.  When you look into the creature's eyes, you can see Lawrence Talbot begging for mercy underneath.

The gore in the film is on scale with many modern zombie films.  The viewer gets to see human jaws impaled by werewolf claws, internal organs freed of their human confines, entrails and blood spattered all over the place and more than enough decapitations.

Yes, there is some CGI in the film, particularly when the Wolfman takes to running and during transformations, but the creature itself is all make-up, hair and Benicio del Toro.

Is the film great, not by a long shot.  It does have a few boring sequences and a bit of stiff acting, but overall it is well worth watching.  As of this writing, it is still in theaters.  If you haven't seen it in the theater yet, I highly recommend you do so if for no other reason than to see the big bad Wolfman fill up the screen and howl at the full moon in the background after rampaging through London.  It's one of the greatest shots I've viewed at the movies in a long time.

For fans of werewolves, whether you'r idea of a werewolf is from ""The Howling"" or ""Ginger Snaps,"" I highly recommend this film and  definitely recommend the 1941 classic.  Horror fans in general will also appreciate this film for its terror and ""boo!"" moments.  Action fans will also enjoy this movie.

Interestingly, the DVD and Blu-Ray release will feature a further 17 minutes of footage, aka ""Directors Cut"" which according to an interview with the director is mostly in the first half of the movie to build tension, and fill in some back story.
It was said that here (the cinematic) release wanted to be concise and get to the first transformation sequence in as soon as possible to keep the audience attention. This ideal I can understand, as all too often one must sit through an hour of build up to get to the meat of the action (no pun intended) and see what has been teased in trailers and TV spots. Time will tell as to whether these 17 minutes make a whole lot of difference, my view is that it will be a nice to have, rather than a need to have. For me the picture felt pretty complete.
Del Toro is great from the first scene as the grieving brother summoned by his late siblings fianc&eacute; to the funeral, to try to find out what happened after his mangled remains are found in a ditch near the family's stately home.
There's an air of a troubled past about from the get go, as he reunites with his estranged father Anthony Hopkins. We learn in flashback that he witnessed his mothers apparent suicide and was committed to an asylum and suffered untold horrors by his father at a young age, in hopes of cleansing him of something.
Hopkins as always is masterful, and more than distracting as the brooding Lord of the manor, with more than a few secrets to hide.
Hugo Weaving, as Inspector Abberline also puts in a fine performance, as does Art Malik in a nice cameo role.
The similarities to the original Lon Chaney are hinted at more than played out, but it feels, and looks good as he begins to delve into the history of Blackmoor, the nearby gypsy encampment, and the family ""curse"".
They did a great job with filming locations. Chatsworth house (The Blackmoor stately home) is actually in a lot better condition than they made it appear with a dreary run down CGI touch up, and may be familiar to viewers of many movies like Pride & Prejudice. Actually about 160 miles from London, for the purpose of the movie it's setting is supposed nearer to the capital, as Del Toro walks there from London towards the climax of the movie. Castle Combe in Wiltshire is used extensively for the village scenes, and creates a perfect period feel for the late 19th century setting. Those who have actually been to that part of England will know that ""yes, it actually looks like that today"" an obvious reason why it was chosen.
 Emily Blunt is captivating but deliberately understated as the grieving fianc&eacute;, slowly drawn to Del Toro's gentle handling, and the romantic connection is thoughtful without being overplayed.
So to the special effects and make up, well those familiar with Rick Bakers talents, particularly in the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Werewolf-in-London-Special-Edition/dp/B0024FADD8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Werewolf in London Special Edition</a>&nbsp;(which is seen by many as still the benchmark for the most realistic depiction of the transition from man to wolf) will not be disappointed. Here however, we get more of a direct reference to the original, in that Del Toro is an upright Wolf Man, sort of 50/50 as opposed to being completely lupine or monstrous as in the recent Underworld movies for example.
It was also interesting to read that the makeup took only two hours to apply, and one to remove, with Baker remarking that the hirsute Del Toro was easy to change from his current form, to ""just a more hairy version of Del Toro with teeth and claws""!
You can complain about the constant full moons, the question of where Del Toro's clothes disappear to and reappear when he changes back, and a number of artistic flaws in the story, but the pace and suspense of the movie keep you viewing. This is escapism after all.
There are some graphic scenes during the numerous changes and attacks, but the strength of the tension lies more in the good old fashioned scary moments, plenty of searching of dark rooms, and roaming around at night in forests, and more than a few ""Boo"" moments to make most people alarmed.
It's a relatively predictable story, I saw the end coming a mile away, as I'm sure most did, and of course the filmmakers have the left the door open for a sequel. That said, it's an impressive piece of gothic horror well presented with today's technology and sure to do well at the box office, and on DVD. 4 Stars.",1268006400,52,4722,4.800982800982801

3601374,3,B001GCUO0W,"Directed by Joe Johnston (""Jurassic Park III"", ""Honey, I Shrunk The Kids"") and written by Andrew Kevin Walker (""Se7en"", ""Sleepy Hollow"") and David Self (""The Road to Perdition""), there is a lot to like about ""The Wolfman"", the new big budget version of the classic Universal horror film. Unfortunately, there is just as much confusing narrative to cause confusion and dislike about it as well. Ultimately, it is a forgettable film, which is a shame because as you watch it, you keep hoping it will ultimately swing the other way.

London, 1891. Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro), an actor touring in England, returns to his ancestral home, Blackmoor, at the request of his dead brother's fianc&eacute;e, Gwen (Emily Blunt, ""Sunshine Cleaning"", ""The Devil Wears Prada""). His brother was recently killed in a strange, savage animal attack and she needs his assistance trying to comfort his father, Sir John (Anthony Hopkins). Larry arrives at his ancestral estate and finds it in a sad condition; nothing appears to have been cleaned in ages and there is a deep sense of dread about the house and the small town nearby. Larry visits his dead brother's body and realizes the attack was not made by a normal animal and people in the town start to blame the attack on a Wolf Man. The blame also starts to fall on a group of traveling gypsies led by Maleva (Geraldine Chaplin). Soon, Larry is attacked by the wolf and races against the impending full moon to find out who the wolf man is. And when he realizes Gwen might be in danger, his mission accelerates. Then, Inspector Abberline (Hugo Weaving, ""The Matrix"", ""Priscilla Queen of the Desert""), a Scotland Yard Inspector, arrives to lead the investigation.

Johnston is not a very prolific director. He's had some hits and some misses. His debut ""Honey, I Shrunk The Kids"" showed promise but with the exception of ""The Rocketeer"" and ""Jumanji"" his films have been very uneven and most would be best described as ""Cable-Ready"" fare. ""Jurassic Park III"" should have been released direct to video. Both screenwriters, Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self have penned highly original, interesting screenplays and you would probably expect something interesting and unusual from them. Most of the problems with ""The Wolfman"" arise in the narrative. And for that, the screenwriters and director receive most of the blame.

What I did like about the film is it is just dripping with atmosphere. Dirt and leaves line the entry hall of Blackmoor. The exterior is lined with black moss giving the building a decaying look. This theme is carried throughout; the night scenes are filled with black, white and silver, which I am sure is no surprise, but the method in which this is done lends the film a unique look, making it appear almost monochromatic, almost as though it is a black and white film.

The narrative has a quick pulse to it, giving the film a faster pace than you might expect. In many films like this, a lot of time is spent establishing the mythology of the characters and the setting. Often the film runs two hours plus as a result. In ""The Wolfman"", as a scene ends, the action seems to shift and fast forward to the next set-up. This keeps the pace brisk and also mimics the actions of the actors when they are turning into the wolves. It's a nice touch and helps give the film a slightly stylized look.

I also appreciate the fact the filmmakers decided to make the film a period piece. I'm not exactly sure why this was done, but it does lend an air of interest to the film. Does it make it more believable? Maybe. It seems the more old-fashioned a setting, the more believable it is to see a man turn into a wolf. Somehow, if the film were set in present day, the threat wouldn't be as real. Surely there is some modern weapon that could be used to trap and or kill a wolf man more easily. The original film was released in 1941 and this new version jumps back sixty years before that. Giving the film a period setting, even if it isn't the same period, somehow, strangely, seems like a tribute to the original. Perhaps this is meant to be a prequel, Del Toro's character is Larry Talbot, the same name of Lon Chaney Jr.'s wolf man. Maybe Del Toro is meant to be the ancestor of the character later played by Chaney. It's a nice thought, but I'm not sure how much of this was deliberate.

This new version is an R-rated film, which is a nice change of pace in the current marketplace. So many studio films are created with the caveat they must receive a PG or PG-13 rating, to ensure the millions of teen-aged boys who buy multiple tickets can get into the theater. An R-rating allows this film to paint a bloodier picture, a more 'realistic' picture of the carnage of what a wolf man can and would create. How stupid would it be to have a film like this rated PG-13? Every time the wolf attacks, the camera would have to cut away to the reaction of someone standing nearby, or a shadow on a wall showing us the action. This is probably what would have been done in the 40s and this technique could be applied with some great success in this project. But to make it work, the filmmaker has to apply some great skill and finesse. In ""The Wolfman"", there more blood and gore, less skill and finesse. It seems like an acceptable balance.

There is a significant amount of exposition dedicated to making us believe Benicio Del Toro is the heir to an English estate, in 1881. His father (Anthony Hopkins) makes a comment about Larry's time spent with his aunt in the United States. There is a reference to his mother, who may have been Spanish. But it just doesn't work. Del Toro is a great actor and he always brings a lot of intensity to the roles he plays. But you don't ever believe he is the son of Anthony Hopkins. You have to quickly get past this little bit of information and move on, because the film has more story to get through and it won't wait for you.

As we hear Gwen narrate the beginning of the film, we see a brief shot of Lawrence on stage as Hamlet and the camera pushes forward abruptly and we see another shot of Lawrence as Macbeth, then the camera pushes forward and we watch as Lawrence's brother is murdered by a large beast. This beginning scene is very good at setting up the tone for the entire film. Even though this is a period piece, the camera never lingers too long and the action continues to move forward. Late in the film, as we watch Lawrence transform into the beast, his face gets a little hairy and then his body jerks forward and we see that his face has transformed again. Each time his body convulses, or jerks forward, another bit of the transformation takes place. Both of these methods seemed similar and help to advance the narrative in a quick, almost modern way. It might seem like this would be a little jarring, given the film is set in 1881 England, you might expect a film more reminiscent of Merchant Ivory, but it is a refreshing way to tell the story.

Del Toro is always a pretty intense actor and this serves him well in his performance of Lawrence Talbot. As he becomes embroiled in the mystery and learns more about the situation, you get the sense there is a growing anger lying beneath his surface, an anger that he is barely able to contain. When this anger reaches its apex, it unleashes the beast within him.

Anthony Hopkins is one of the greatest actors of our time. But he is also an actor who frequently just walks through the parts he is playing, like he can't muster the enthusiasm to make the role something memorable. So he simply plays Anthony Hopkins. Granted, Anthony Hopkins playing himself is a lot better than most would do with the role, but we have seen this man in some truly great, truly memorable performances. Because of this, it is disappointing to watch him simply play himself. If he isn't able to muster the enthusiasm for the role, why take it?

Emily Blunt is good as Gwen, the woman who first must mourn the loss of her fianc&eacute;e and then realizes she is attracted to the man's brother. She brings intelligence and strength to the role that helps to set it apart from the typical damsel in distress.

Hugo Weaving plays Inspector Abbeline, the Scotland Yard inspector sent to the Moors to help with this strange case. There is a brief reference to Abbeline's previous duty hunting Jack the Ripper, a nice touch helping to make his character seem more vital. When he arrives, he finds the townspeople in arms trying to impart their own brand of justice. Abbeline quickly puts a stop to it and begins his official investigation. But events quickly take over and he finds himself unable to stay ahead of the investigation and must fight to keep from drowning.

When you are dealing with a fantasy film, a horror film, a film depicting anything out of the ordinary, it is vital to get one aspect of the production absolutely and completely right. The story has to be airtight. If it is, if the filmmakers follow their own established rules for the universe they are creating, if all of the characters fit together correctly, if everything makes sense in these parameters, we can enjoy the ride and the film. If there are problems with the story, we become distracted and start to look for other problems. Is the make-up believable, is that special effect working, did they recreate that scene correctly? We begin to pick it apart. There are problems with ""The Wolfman"" and these distract us from the rest of the film.

Ultimately, I didn't leave the theater fearful of the next full moon and that is a problem.",1267401600,2,9561,4.56734693877551

Of course, we all know the basic Wolfman story, from the outstanding portrayal of the creature by the late Lon Chaney.  This time, we have a remake with Anthony Hopkins (as Daddy Talbot) and Benecio De Toro (as Laurence Talbot), plus some special effects that we not available in the old days.

We begin on a full-moon night in England, in 1891.  Daddy Talbot's other son is walking through a wooded area and attacked by a horrible monster that slashes him apart.  The Talbot man's fianc writes his brother (Larry), who is living in New York.  Expressing concern for her fiance's disappearance, she asks Larry for his help.

Larry arrives at the family estate, an old English manor in disrepair and finds his estranged father alive and well, accompanied by the family dog and a man-servant from India.  The son/brother's body had just been recovered.  Larry travels through the English countryside to a small town to see his brother's body, which is being kept in a meat house pending the burial service.  Of course, Larry has to pull back the sheet, and sees the body looking pretty bad.

Back at the family estate, Larry begins having flashbacks about seeing his mother dead from what appeared to be a suicide when he was a young boy.  After her death, Daddy sent him to an asylum for a year and then sent him off to live with a relative in New York.

Larry is determined to find the beast that attacked his brother and decides to visit the gypsy camp one night. (Duh--would you go out at night when you knew there was a werewolf in the area and it was a full-moon night to boot?  I hope Larry doesn't tell ""blond"" jokes :-).  Of course, you don't have to be a rocket-scientist to guess that Larry gets attacked and bitten by the wolfman.  And so it begins--once bitten. . .

Larry is sewn up by the gypsy woman and returns home.  A Scotland Yard detective shows up at the manor to investigate and a few unpleasant comments are expressed by both men.  Shortly afterwards, Larry begins to change.  He has some scary nightmares and he begins to develop sight, hearing, and smelling sensitivities.  His body begins to change before our eyes one night and he goes on a killing spree.  The change is done well, too.  Needless to say, the local villagers are severely spooked and the story continues to reveal some additional information.

I really enjoyed the movie.  I thought it was well done and added a few new things just to keep the story fresh.  Anthony Hopkins was wonderful in his part, but don't let this worn-out but classy gentleman act fool you.  He is a not a very nice guy.  Benecio De Toro was also wonderful in his role.  The orchestra music added to the film and the visual effects were wonderful.  There were also some nice scenery shots of London and the English countryside.

This is NOT a movie for your young and impressionable children.  There is blood, guts and gore for shock value, murders, and asylum torture.  Heads and body parts are ripped off and people are gashed open.  Your children will have nightmares over this stuff.  If you can take that stuff yourself, then this was a really good movie.  (Normally, I won't go to this kind of violent film either, but, I grew up with the Wolfman, Frankenstein, and Dracula stories, so I had to see it.)",1267228800,68,3286,4.549488054607509
3601376,5,B001GCUO0W,"As I sat in my movie seat willfully ignoring the four other people, I imagined I had the whole theater to myself.  I was looking forward to seeing a movie that was based on my Dad's favorite monster, the Wolfman.  I had no idea what to expect and then The Wolfman started and once the howling and screaming began, this movie didn't let up until the end.
I loved the gothic setting with the beautiful gloomy and dreary atmosphere of the funeral that invoke feelings of past Hammer Horror greatness.  The classic movie monsters will always be my favorite films of childhood.  To get this out in the open, I hate remakes and the idea that Universal was going to bring The Wolfman back to life filled me with dread. Once again, Hollywood would be taking wonderful past memories and stomping the life out of them.  Not in this case and I am glad I was wrong.
The original Wolfman had fine performances from Lon Chaney Jr. and Bela Lugosi.  Curt Siodmak's screenplay brought the Wolfman to life. Siodmak injected a several good ideas into his screenplay such as silver bullets.  Past Universal Horror movies was based on great literature as in the cases of Frankenstein and Dracula.  I applaud Siodmak for tackling a film without a novel to work from.
Then came Hammer who rejected the classic movie monsters with British blood and a lot gore, which was extreme for that time.
Now Universal comes full circle and updates all the gore, violence, and suspense that made the original so much fun.
Rick Baker's makeup is just fantastic and I was glad that CGI didn't ruin the new Wolfman.  The CGI that was used was fine and I didn't really realize it until I saw the bear which I forgave the filmmakers for because a real bear would have up the costs and some actor would have probably lost a much needed limp.
Danny Elfman's score is haunting and builds up suspenseful scenes almost to the point of discomfort. I love the scenes where Lawrence Talbot is sneaking around his father's house and you hear a little uneasy music and then silence. Silence in Horror movies is the worst time because it is a lot like being at the top of a rollarcoaster, its just going to stop your heart once you get over the hump. Then the silence is invaded by Elfman's intense score.  Also, seeing The Wolfman in a theater with a good loud sound system helps out a lot too.
  The real star of The Wolfman is Benicio Del Toro who does a great job portraying Lawrence Talbot.  Equally good is Sir Anthony Hopkins as Talbot's father and the always lovely Emily Blunt as Lawrence's love interest, and Hugo Weaving as Detective Francis Aberline.  Weaving is great as the detective driven to save the village from werewolves and all the resulting deaths that werewolves accomplish during a rage.
  I don't think any fan who grew up on the classic movie monsters will have any problems seeing The Wolfman.  This movie gives Horror films a much needed revamp with Horror is at an all time low.  This is the way to take a classic movie and update it with modern tricks.  Director Joe Johnston does a great job with the material.
I hope the Universal with revamp Frankentein, Dracula, The Creature from the Black Lagoon, and the Invisible Man in a similar vein.
Other Werewolves movies that have gave me countless, wonderful sleepless nights are The Wolfman (1941), Werewolf of London (1935), Curse of the Werewolf (1961), The Howling (1981), The Company of Wolves (1984), Wolfen (1981), Frankenstein meets the Wolfman (1943), An American Werewolf in London (1981), Silver Bullet (1985), and Ginger Snaps (2000).  There was also an execellent short live series on TV called Werewolf that aired on Fox in the 80's.  Also a nod to Marvel's Werewolf by Night.  Stephen King gave us Cycle of the Werewolf (1985, see Silver Bullet for the film based on the book.)

3601418,3,B001GCUO0W,"I haven't been a loyal follower of the horror genre.  I know about the Universal classics, and appreciate the effort it takes to create a sense of fear ans suspense in your audience.  But these kinds of movies aren't my favorite (I prefer the psychologically disturbing kinds of thrillers, like some of Hitchcock's work or Kubrick's).

I basically went to see this movie because my Dad (a huge fan of the 1930s classics and 1950s creature features) bought me a ticket.  After seeing ""The Wolfman"" in theaters, I can say that I would've been happy if I bought my own ticket.  But once was enough for me.

I think this film succeeds at being a fun time at the movies, and will be worth a good DVD rental.  But I think if you try to analyze ""The Wolfman""'s on a deeper level, you'll discover that there's a terrific story that never got to unleash itself.

Our story takes place in 19th century England, where an American actor named Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) is summoned home because his brother is missing.  When Lawrence's brother is dead when he arrives, he decides to investigate what could've mutilated his brother so savagely.  His cold distant father (played with with great relish by Anthony Hopkins) keeps Lawrence --- and us --- at complete discomfort.  Emily Blunt's character Gwen (dead brother's love, alive brother's newfound love?) doesn't really hit her stride until the later half of the picture, but Blunt is a beautiful and gentle presence on the screen.  It's a good fright when you take her warmth for granted, only to have director Joe Johnston give you a good 'BOO!' to shake you up.  Thankfully, Hugo Weaving as Detective Abberline (as in Jack The Ripper's detective) is a commanding tour de force, perhaps moreso than the sinsiter Hopkins.

I hope you forgive my revealing of Hopkins to be more than he seems.  Frankly, his character's plot isn't so much about what happens; you already know where this story is going, and it's to Hopkins' and the crew's credit that we can still enjoy getting there.  I'm sure it's no surprise that after Lawrence is attacked by the terrorizing wolf, he soon begins to change.  Benicio Del Toro is a strange casting choice, because he doesn't deliver a very cahrismatic or charming performance.  His brooding isn't entirely satisfying either.  However, his some bland performance actually helps the second half of the movie.  If you were to become infatuated with Lawrence Talbot, you would enjoy the Wolfman terror far more than we should.  To some degree, the audience must accept that the Wolfman creature is a menace to society, and must be destroyed.  Perhaps you won't share in the local mob's paranoia...but maybe you would.

I shouldn't get your hopes too high about these depths and subtleties, because Joe Johnston and his post-production team don't really bring them to the surface.  The audience is going to have to do a little digging of their own, and that's a shame.  Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self (screenwriters for ""Seven"" and ""Road To Perdition"", respectively) surely had more ideas than what we get on the screen.

However, if the gore, atmosphere, and scare factor are what you're looking for on the screen, then ""The Wolfman"" has plenty of it.  The action sequences are very well done, and gruesome for the squeamish.  This movie made me jump out of ym seat a few times; there were moments where I just couldn't stand the intensity anymore.  Even when you know a red herring is coming, you still spook, because the production team has timed them very well.  As for the look of the film, I hope the Academy remembers ""The Wolfman"" come Oscar season in 2001, because this is a terrific looking picture.  The creepy mansion with the cobwebs, the costuming, the ravaged caracsses, the visual effects --- all top-notch.  CGI hasn't been kind to humans and creatures effects, but I never once doubted what I saw on the screen.  Rick baker's makeup and the FX crew prove that CGI can work hand in hand with the right care and craftsmanship.  Danny Elfman's music is also very good.  I wouldn't buy the CD, but still pleasing to the ears.

At a brisk 105 minutes, ""The Wolfman"" is a good time for fans of this genre.  I probably won't watch it again, because its first half feels on autopilot.  But this new verison of ""The Wolfman"" overcomes all fears of awful remakes, or ridiculous plot deviations for the sake of being different.  This is a dark movie with some good scares, carnage, and production that will fill your horror cravings.",1266969600,2,4523,4.75

3601420,2,B001GCUO0W,"Watching this latest incarnation of the Wolfman take huge, Superman, Spiderman CGI leaps across London rooftops is absolutely ridiculous.  Just because they can do remarkable things with CGI does NOT mean they need do so.  In this film, in sequences like the one mentioned above, the Wolfman has more in common with Superman or Spiderman than in what he actually is, and that is a werewolf.

And because we live in a crime-ridden culture inundated with blood and guts, we see that a-plenty in this film - and all at the expense of deeper dialogue and scenes to let the viewers know more about the lead characters.  And the wham-bam-thank-you-mam love-story does not work whatsoever...thus the ultimate demise of Larry Talbot has no emotional wallop.  There is also a completely absurd scene (lifted from the dualing werewolves in ""Werewolf in London"" and ""Wolf."")  It was, quite frankly, highly embarassing watching Wolfman Wrestlemania.

The score by Danny Elfman is just background pulse and not really music.  Hans J. Salter's music for the Chaney original had a driving, strong-themed pathos to it.  Anyway, the golden days of the truly great film composers seems to have passed:  in them good old days you could tell a Herrman score from a Steiner score or a Goldsmith score, etc. Those were the days composers had their own distinctive voice. Nowadays, most movie music all sounds the same  so that it is almost impossible to tell one composer from the next.

Chaney's Lawrence Talbot smiled, joked, chased his love-interest with the lust of a real man before he becomes cursed - and ends up in the film's finale chasing Evelyn Ankers through a wonderfully atmospheric Welsh forest with his beastial side now on the hunt for the poor, love-smitten lady.  The father/son relationship and final conflict in the original is much more tragic and emotionally moving than the silly one in this version.

The sets were good, the forest scenes very good and Rick Baker's makeup and transformation sequences were all very good.  It is the script that takes the most blame for making this movie disapponting.  Sacrificing character development just to add more action has been the bane (and I don't mean wolf-bane) of many a movie made today.  Pour on the blood when you can't have good, strong dialog pour forth from the actor's mouths.

We believe in Lon Chaney's nice guy turned bad by a bite and a curse and we could believe in Claude Rains as a skeptical but ultimately shocked-into-believing father.  In this film, I didn't believe a word spoken twixt father and son - or anyone else for that matter.

Subtlety has all but died in movies anymore.  People just have to see everything - or at least studio execs and film directors believe so.  But the jailhouse cell transformation of Oliver Reed  in ""Curse of the Werewolf"" is much more powerful and frightening than watching hands mutate and feet grow and rip their ways out of boots. More often than not, less is more - and that is something so many film-makers fail to deliver to today's action-craving audiences.

Anyway, while this film has some very atmosperic shots and a good-looking wolfman (based on Jack Pierce's original) it is ultimately a dreary disappointment.  I just didn't feel a thing for anybody.  And in a monster movie about a soul-in-torment, that element is critical.  A miss and a bloody mess of a movie.  And now I hear they're going to remake ""Bride of Frankenstein""  That's almost as bad as remaking ""Citizen Kane.""  I can hardly wait!  (lol)",1266710400,18,3521,4.847571189279732

From a filmmaker's end, one should also not expect revolutionary technical perfection.  From a film historical end, one should not expect a strenuous remake of the original.  Rather, when one views The Wolfman, it should be done with the same intent that audience of the original film, to have a few moments of intense, creepy, thrill-ride fun.

The classic monster film The Wolf Man was never meant to be ultra-realistic, nor intensely creepy in a psychologically disturbing sense.  Those are better left to darker films of the era by (generally) other studios such as United Artists'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-Zombie-1932-Remastered-Edition/dp/B000853QN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White Zombie (1932) [Remastered Edition</a>] or international offerings like Carl Th. Dryer's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vampyr-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00180R06I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vampyr - Criterion Collection</a>.  The Wolf Man had a psychological element to it, to be sure; a werewolf movie of the modern age must.  However, the lasting effects of the film are more that of some few moments of some creepy moments and some (at the time) thrilling suspense set in a dark, foggy forest in the countryside of the British Isles.  Almost seventy years later, Universal's new Wolfman echoes the same value of blockbuster fun that the original brought about in its day.

Major elements of the plot have changed.  One might think of this version as more of a fond, nostalgic homage to the original than a faithful remake.  It is a re-envisioning of the story.  Only in the loose sense of using many of the same character names, atmosphere, and nods in plot device does it bear a decent resemblance.  The loose skeleton of the plot remains, however Lawrence Talbot's means of coming home to his father's estate have been somewhat altered, a romp through downtown London is added, traits of many characters have been greatly restructured and, from the midpoint on, the story takes surprising turns to throw off those who were assuming the end would be identical to the original.  There is also a notable amount more violence in this film.  Perhaps this is the most off-putting part of the remake, however it is not nearly as bad as I have heard previously reviewed.  As a friend and coworker recently told me, ""It's a werewolf film. You should expect a few people to have arms and legs ripped off.""  Sure, the original did not show very much violence.  Then again, it was 1941... the Hays Code didn't allow it.  They sensationalized all of the violence, horror makeup, and moody atmosphere they could for that endeavor as well, though it is tame and amusing by today's standard.

The acting was spot-on.  Benicio Del Toro is great as the tragic character of Lawrence Talbot.  He plays it as a good man filled with a life of tragedy, whose soul is forever scarred.  He fulfills what Lon Chaney, Jr. (the original Lawrence Talbot/Wolf Man) said was always so great about the classic monsters, ""All the great monsters were always played for sympathy.""  Del Toro does this and, occasionally, you think he is channeling a bit of Chaney's ghost in his performance.  Sir Anthony Hopkins chews the scenery as a much different Sir John Talbot, Lawrence's father... and the audience loves every minute of it because it is simply Hopkins doing his usual ""clever, off-putting eccentric"" role.  Emily Blunt is a sweet, sympathetic Gwen Conliffe, caught in the midst of a terrible trial.  She has Evelyn Anker's sad blue eyes.  Geraldine Chaplin, the daughter of the great Charlie Chaplin, is wonderful but underused as the wise gypsy woman Maleva.  I hope to see more of her in the 17 minutes the director promises to restore to the first third of the film for the DVD.

What I enjoy about The Wolfman most is that it tried to keep the atmosphere of the original.  The pale, foggy moors of England (Wales in the original, but close enough), cold, barren forests, and ancient village are a surreal playground for such a delicious romp.  Del Toro's makeup by Rick Baker was an obvious homage to the original, though a definite expansion.  More than this, certain themes of the plot were left intact that were quite notable in the original.  For example, there is a running thread of difference from Almighty God that is inescapable in both.  The element of damnation seen in the appearance of pentagrams and Lawrence's discomfort inside the church presented in the original are made more blunt in the explicit talk of curses and damnation in this version, and by things such as the intriguingly Anglo-Catholic blessing of Maleva to Gwen in a late plot point.

All in all, The Wolf Man was an enjoyable couple of hours of fun and nostalgic pleasure.  It is not the 1941 Wolf Man. Those expecting a shot-by-shot retelling of the original will go away greatly disappointed.  It is a suspense/action/horror/chiller film in the same vein if such existed seventy years onward and, for lovers of the original, a nostalgic reminder of what made us love the original in the first place.  If one wishes to see a different take on the characters and motif of The Wolf Man from a 21st Century perspective, The Wolfman will take you on a fun ride back through the dark, foggy moors of the English Isles that never really existed except on dry-ice laden sound-stages, but where the tragic beast within Lawrence Talbot continues to roam when ""the wolfsbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright.""",1266624000,3,5950,5.282678002125398
3601424,3,B001GCUO0W,"Atmospherically, ""The Wolfman"" is spot on, which means there are a lot of behind-the-scenes people to thank. Let's start with Rick Heinrichs, the production designer; his sets evoke a gothic style that may not be realistic, but is an absolute pleasure to look at. Then there's Rick Baker, who has proven time and time again that he's a master at makeup effects; his werewolf designs are convincingly primal, all ghoulish facial contortions and untamed tufts of fur. There's also Shelly Johnson, whose shadowy cinematography brilliantly captures the essence of the horror genre. Milena Canonero's costumes are effectively drab. Danny Elfman's score is wonderfully moody. From a technical point of view, this movie is a triumph.

But as a story, it's a serious let down. I find this odd, since the basic plot is the same as the original 1941 film written by Curt Siodmak. I'm sure director Joe Johnston and writers Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self had the best of intentions, but unfortunately, they let their film fall victim to weak character development, unresolved subplots, and scenes that place gore above genuine fright. It's an updated film, alright - for audiences that favor heavy action and elaborate death scenes. Like so many remakes that have come before it, ""The Wolfman"" takes a neat idea and turns it into a shallow spectacle of art direction and special effects.

The plot: In the year 1891, Shakespearean actor Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) returns from New York to England when he learns of the death of his brother, Ben. For reasons I won't reveal, Lawrence has kept himself distant from his family, especially his father, Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins), an unaffectionate man who lives in a sprawling estate so dreary, it's a wonder it isn't teeming with ghosts. When Lawrence gets a look at his brother's body, he's repulsed; Ben was ripped to shreds, either by a wild animal or a deranged lunatic. Prompted by his own grief - and by his brother's fiance, Gwen (Emily Blunt) - Lawrence takes it upon himself to get to the bottom of things.

The discovery of a medallion on Ben's body leads Lawrence to a gypsy camp, where Ben had been acting as a liaison between them and the town. A mysterious old woman (Geraldine Chaplin) gives him the obligatory warning about an ancient curse, which is appropriate given the fact that tonight just happens to be a full moon. And that's right about the time a vicious werewolf attacks the camp, resulting in Lawrence getting bitten. You know what happens when a werewolf bites you during a full moon, don't you?

Here enters Inspector Francis Aberline of Scotland Yard (Hugo Weaving), who has reason to believe that Lawrence is hiding something. Let's just say that the Talbots haven't been the happiest of families.

The problems with this movie don't have much to do with the tone, although I must admit, the updated animal-attack scenes were a bit heavy handed with the gore. No, the real problems stem from the content, or rather, how the content was reinterpreted. Consider the inevitable romance between Lawrence and Gwen; while tragedy often times diminishes the capacity for overt emotions, the way these two regard each other is so low key that it's impossible to believe they would ever fall in love. It's never really explained why they fell in love in the first place. Maybe this has to do with pacing, since the final cut makes it seems as if they developed feelings over the course of one day.

Some of the blame rests with the actors, or maybe with the way the actors were directed (it's hard to tell sometimes). Del Toro, an accomplished actor in all respects, plays Lawrence as an emotionless drone. He's quiet, monotone, and shows virtually no range - except, of course, for when he's transforming into a werewolf, at which point he's buried by computer graphics and makeup. Hopkins isn't much better; his character is a man of mystery, and yet he's so passive and matter-of-fact in his delivery that none of his revelations shock us. Not that it matters a great deal, since his secrets aren't all that plausible within the context of the story.

It's sad when the technical achievements of a film upstage the story. There are moments of dazzling cinematic wizardry, such as when Lawrence hallucinates while under the influence of psychiatric drugs. You're amazed by the visuals, but you're also at a loss to explain how they're significant to the plot. To me, it all seemed like filler material, a way to compensate for a lack of imagination. Perhaps the film's troubled production is responsible; numerous reshoots and a rejection of Danny Elfman's score (which was subsequently used anyway) saw the original release date of November 2008 give way to February 2009, April 2009, and November 2009 before finally opening on February 12, 2010. With such long delays and drastic changes in direction, it's no wonder the end result is bit disappointing.",1266451200,6,4936,4.8971291866028706

Hey, Larry Talbot goes home to a spooky old mansion and a weird old man, and there's a wolfman out in the countryside tearing some viscious Ay that's going to give him a very nasty bite.  The film looks great and there's atmosphere aplenty, and it moves quickly and wastes no time getting down to the business of eviscerating mayhem.  It both honored and updated the old film nicely.  Weirder and bloodier, but that's about right for an update.  I liked the interim in the insane asylum and the other tweaks to the story, and with the help of Rick Baker's terrific prosthetics you get some stunning transformations.  Yeah, of course there's CGI, but I thought it was used pretty much only where necessary.  As an aside, I thought it was eerie how much Benecio Del Toro suggested a thinner Lon Chaney Jr.

I dunno, I went to see a monster movie, and that's what I got.  A pretty darn good one too, that ripped along with a flourish.  There was no deception.

3601448,1,B001GCUO0W,"Except for the 1979 Universal remake of Dracula, there hasn't been a decent remake of the original Universal Monster series movies.  This Wolfman follows in the tradition of indecency--substituting CGI for subtlety, a Lawrence Talbot that looks like he needs a laxative more than a silver bullet, an overbearing score (derivative of that from the aforesaid 1979 Dracula remake--compare the two), the overuse of ""scary"" sound effects, and buckets of gore instead of the talented use of restrained violence found in the original Wolfman.  In the original, Lon Chaney portrayed a man capable of charm, humor and humility, while the undercurrent of deeply disturbed persona was visible at all times.  The guy was a world class alcholic and this may have helped.  The new Larry Talbot seems only capable of painful grimaces while trying to do a Chaney imitation. Strange too, when you think of the talent of B D T who should have done better. Hopkins?  He's doing Lecter Lite in this one, and the revelation of what he really is was obvious from the beginning. Another thing--the director of this movie seems to love to have artistically lit and framed shots--why not?  But if you watch this movie, it's more like a story board that got slightly jumbled up.  Shot 102, followed by 104, followed by 103, etc.  Maybe they should stake the editor.  At times this movie degenerates visually into a quasi cartoon.  All in all a disappointment and a waste of an outstanding cast.  Watch the 1941 original. OWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!",1266364800,14,1517,4.956521739130435

3601451,4,B001GCUO0W,"Out of all the classic Universal monster films, The Wolfman was my least favorite. Frankenstein, Dracula, and even The Invisible Man all seemed to be in a league of their own while The Wolfman didn't seem to fit in the same demographic that those films did. Once this film went into production, the cast was announced, and pictures leaked from the set, I was extremely excited. This remake had everything going for it to be everything the original film was and then some. So that's the mindset I had going into the film and luckily it didn't disappoint. The homages to the original film are definitely there, especially during Lawrence's first transformation sequence and attack on the men hunting him. Not only that, but the film is practically overflowing with blood and gore. With films relating to vampires or werewolves, they need to be scary and intimidating. We need to know what these monsters are capable of. The carnage and bloodshed is glorious in this film. In fact, as a horror fan, it gave me chills. The film's setting in 1891 or thereabouts helped establish the mood and look of the film and was certainly used to its advantage since it's hard to imagine the film having as much of an impact in a different setting. But above all else, this movie should be seen in the theater for the sound. Hearing this type of film in surround sound is one of the reasons I keep going back to theater. There was a scene with water dripping that sounded like it was dripping right behind me and hearing that howl shake the floor and vibrate your seat is a joy. If you plan on seeing this movie, see it in a theater you know has spectacular sound. It is well worth it.

There isn't much regarding flaws for the film. As a massive horror fan, this film really delivered in all aspects. During the trailers, it seemed like everyone involved was just reading off of cue cards or something. While watching the film, the performances seem to build. The two actors that stood out the most were the two main ones; Benicio Del Toro and Anthony Hopkins. Watching the film in context, the way they talk is uncomfortable since they haven't seen each other for so long and their reactions and interactions get more intense as the film advances. Del Toro's performance shines during his return visit to the asylum he was at as a child and Anthony Hopkins is truly magnificent in the second half. I found it odd that Hopkins was saying everything twice in the trailers for the film (""Terrible things, Lawrence. You've done terrible things,"" ""Be strong, son. Be strong,"" etc). and he does do that quite a bit throughout the film, but his character gets a lot more interesting later on. It didn't bother me in the long run. Regarding the look of The Wolfman, nothing really presents itself that there were any changes regarding its design. He looks incredible and the mix of practical make-up effects and CGI result in one of the better werewolf designs in recent years. There are a few scenes during the transformation sequences that are noticeably CGI, but they're few and far between and are pulled off in excellent fashion for the most part.

The Wolfman is easily the most satisfying horror film I've had the pleasure of seeing in quite some time. It is a must-see for horror fans as it's one of the few remakes that is better than the original film. The transformation scenes are spectacular, the carnage that's left is devastating and pure bliss to watch for fans of bloody violence, and the film's sound is truly what makes it worth seeing in theaters since it's done so well. The Wolfman comes highly recommended and is one of the best films to come out in the first few months of 2010.",1266278400,2,3679,4.6067073170731705

3601453,3,B001GCUO0W,"I went into the theater to watch The Wolfman with an open mind and lowered expectations after reading so many bad reviews. I'm a huge fan of the original film, and I was prepared for a few changes in the original story, but I didn't expect them to do a complete rewrite! While this new Wolfman film is slick looking on the surface, the convoluted story line of this remake takes the original's brilliant and simple story and makes it confusing and tedious with too many unintentional laughs.

****SPOILER ALERT****

I have several gripes with this remake.

1) Why does Hollywood insist on putting a romance front and center in every film at all costs!? The changes to the story are not only unnecessary, but absolutely ridiculous.  The original film did have a love interest, but it shared the center story with Talbot's father, who didn't believe in this Werewolf nonsense!  This made the ending heartbreaking in the original as Larry's father realizes he has killed his own son, making for a very dramatic climax! It's one of the most powerful scenes in the original film and it has been removed from the remake? This is like having King Kong win the plane battle on top of the Empire State building and go back to his island living happily ever after!

2) There are too many sub plots, the brother's death, the mother's death, Larry's father is a werewolf, Larry is an actor?, Larry was in an insane asylum, Larry has dreams that make little to no sense.....etc...etc. This wouldn't be so bad if any of them helped to get the viewer involved in the story.....they do not!

3) The make up created by Rick Baker is very good and I respect the fact that he pays homage to the original make-up, but Jack Pierce's original 70-year old make-up design is far superior. The CGI isn't too bad, but there are moments it looks cartoon-ish and unconvincing.  While there are some nice gore scenes, none of them evoke any fear because the film just isn't scary.  The Wolfman's howl is awful and it sounded like it was lifted from the film 'Teen Wolf', in fact the most ridiculous part of this film is the Werewolf battle between father and son, which really reminded me of 'Teen Wolf'!

4) While the acting is very good, the dialogue is tedious and you know you're in trouble when one of the main characters has to give a speech halfway through the film to hopefully get everyone watching up to speed.

5) The film tries to please too many demographics as it isn't scary--but it has some gore, it has a love interest--but it isn't moving and it has a good horror story--but it goes for the laughs.

6) The film is only an hour and thirty five minutes, but seems longer and has no where near the atmosphere of the original.

7) Danny Elfman's music score is inappropriately awful and doesn't even come close the the classic original score by Hans J. Salter!

8) Benicio Del Toro gives a good perfomance, but there is no sympathy for him when he dies. While Lon Chaney jr. may have been heavy handed with his emotional performance in the original, Del Toro is not emotional enough and his character is not all that likable.

The funny thing is as much as I thought this film was a missed opportunity, I still enjoyed it in a strange way. I just like monster movies I guess and it is unfortunate the studio didn't have the ""sac"" to make a film that was made for horror buffs and not for the ""middle of the road"" crowd. This could have been one of the scariest and saddest films of all time.

In short the film looks good, but it just doesn't deliver the goods!  If you want to see some great Werewolf films watch the original Wolfman, Werewolf Of London, American Werewolf in London, or Dog Soldiers.",1266192000,7,3687,4.503748125937031
3601454,4,B001GCUO0W,"We've seen several re-imaginings of the classic universal monsters in the past decades or so. Bram Stoker's Dracula was good, with plenty of blood and weirdness. The latest The Mummy lacked the original's subtle horror but was a genuinely fun and exciting pop corner. Then there was Robert Deniro as The Frankenstein Monster. That movie pretty much blew camel chunks. I kept expecting the Monster to pull out a .22 and wack some guy, TWO BEHIND THE EAR, BADDA-BING!

  So now we have a re-imagining of Universal's The Wolfman. Spelled out in one sentence, if you're a gorehound it ain't bad. It's not especially interesting or thrilling but it does have some good quality kills.

The Good:

Excellent carnage. This is the most blood-thirsty werewolf I've ever seen. It takes out almost an entire gypsy camp in less than the time it takes to tell about it. WOW! He doesn't just leave a trail of blood and bodies behind him, he leaves a trail of organs, eviscerate limbs and internal squishy stuff in general.

The atmosphere. It was better than average. There were some nice, dark creepy environs for Wolfie to creep around in, and there is a part while he's loose in London where he clings to a gargoyle and bays at the moon. The atmosphere was still not quite up to the standards set by the best Hammer films, but it was still done well.

Benicio. He was a great choice. He didn't act that much because honestly the parts were kind of underwritten. But he had a great tragic, mournful presence that you want of the protagonist in your better werewolf movies.

They throw a few bones to the original Wolfman, from the reading of the famous poem at the very beginning to the silver-handled walking stick Anthony Hopkins uses, which looks like a near duplicate of the one used by Claude Rains in the original Wolfman

The Bad:

  It was underwritten. The dialogue is mostly forgettable. They had a chance to really make it interesting but they never really delivered. The Curse was brought over from ***Spoiler*** India, possibly by way of the ancient Babylonian king, Nebuchadnezzar, whom the movie hints may have been the first werewolf, and they could have developed that more, but they just let that one slide. There are several more examples where they could have made the movie much more interesting but just didn't make it happen.

The Romance. There really was none. All your best werewolf movies have to feature a tragic romance. Werewolves are doomed to die at the hands of someone they love OR they kill the ones they love. That's the deal, unless the werewolves are just video game style cannon fodder. I don't mind that kind of werewolf, it can make for some fun movies, but in THIS particular movie, a remake of a classic, I was looking for classic werewolf stuff, and the doomed romance theme is a big part of it. There was not much chemistry between the two leads, although this may have been because they didn't spend much time together. There was one scene where Emily Blunt is tending to a wounded Benicio after he is bitten by a werewolf which had some great potential. They are snuggled together while she tends his wounds and he notices the hollow of her throat. You can tell by his expression that some kind of crazy wolf thoughts are bubbling up from his new dark side but he suppresses them. And that's it. I would have liked to have seen the film explore that more closely.

  All in all I'd have to say that without the gore and shocking violence this movie would be just a shade south of par. Yup, it would have been slightly sub-par. However, because it featured an especially vicious and bloodthirsty werewolf, and because I found the flaming werewolf fight particularly fun, I bumped this one up to 4 stars. Without the gore I'd rate it a 2.5 at best.",1266192000,5,3780,4.619402985074627
3601455,4,B001GCUO0W,"If you're going into WOLFMAN expecting a game changer, you're going to be disappointed. WOLFMAN isn't groundbreaking or a remake that rewrites the story or takes the story in a new direction. It just doesn't, and there's nothing wrong with that. What you do get is the creature of the WOLFMAN brought to new light with new technology. Ultimately, the original WOLFMAN with Lon Chaney, was the story of a MAN who became a wolf. The new WOLFMAN with Benicio Del Torro is the same thing, with an added bonus; the ability to show with violent and hairy detail the reality of the man's WOLF side.

WOLFMAN is ampted up to fit the technology of the day and the audience of the day. Many may say it is gory, or even too gory, but what I say, is that it accurately shows the violent, physical and aggressive speed and strength of a man who becomes WOLF by the light of a full moon. You truly get the feeling of how horrible it is to be someone who just spent the night darting around killing and eating whatever he could, and not being in control of it.

The music, constructed by Danny Elfman, is also something to take note of. It is beautiful and brilliant. It is a merge of old film themed music with the fined tuned chimes of today's music and it works to perfection in reminding you of the movie it is based on, and the movie that it is.

WOLFMAN is a perfectly entertaining movie, as long as you don't go in expecting to be awed. To me, the werewolf changing scene in A WEREWOLF IN LONDON, is still awe-inspiring, and you see that same thing here, x100. Yet, people tend to take movie magic for granted these days and WOLFMAN 2010 deserves its due.",1266192000,,1647,4.340909090909091
3601456,4,B001GCUO0W,"The 1941 horror classic ""The Wolfman"", starring Lon Chaney Jr, featured primitive special effects and a simple, horrific, yet sympathetic tale of a man, bitten by an unknown creature, who becomes a monster at each full moon, and who yearns for release from his terrible curse.

Fast-forward to 2010's ""The Wolf Man."" Laurence Talbot is summoned back to his ancestral home of Talbot Hall on the disappearance of his brother. He arrives to find his brother murdered and multilated, and rashly promises his brother's grieving fiancee Gwen that he will uncover the truth. He visits the local gypsies for answers, only to be bitten by a mysterious beast.

Nursed back to health by Gwen, Laurence is under suspicion by the local villagers, who fear a monster, and by Scotland Yard Inspecter Aberline, who seeks a murdering lunatic. When the killings resume at the next full moon, Laurence discovers the nature of his curse. He is confined at a facility for the criminally insane. There, a visit from his father Sir John reveals the full horror of his situation. Laurence will escape the mental institution to seek his fate at Talbot Hall.

The movie generally follows the 1941 original, with some plot twists involving the (very) troubled Talbot family history. Bernicio del Toro is a sympathetic Laurence. Emily Blunt is stoic and effective as Gwen. Hugo Weaving almost steals the movie as Inspector Aberline. Anthony Hopkins is in full scenery-chewing mode as Sir John. The famous Chatsworth Hall is morphed into a dark, brooding and decrepit Talbot Hall. The movie is full of things that go bump in the night, both real and imagined. The CGI effects are frightening, if surreal and a bit overdone.

""The Wolf Man"" is highly recommended as an entertaining horror flick and a decently-done successor to the original.",1266105600,,1811,4.986754966887418
3601457,4,B001GCUO0W,"The mysterious, Gothic feel of The Wolfman was really well-done.  First of all, it was great of Universal Pictures to release this film on a full moon.  Unfortunately the full moon hit Valentines' weekend.  *shrug* What do you do??

Unlike the 1941 Lon Chaney, Jr. version, which took place in the then-contemporary pre-WWII Europe, this picture takes place in 1890s England, apparently right outside of London, in the inevitably named ""Blackmoor.""  Nice.

Benicio del Toro seems a bit miscast at first glance.  But viewers find out early in the film that Sir Talbot married a Latin woman, so Benitio's Latin looks makes sense.  Without the ""Why me?"" look of Lon Chaney, Jr., Benicio had the fear of God in him instead.

This fear seemed real and sincere, as he discovers he is cursed.  Cursed from the bite of a werewolf.  He implores the local gypsies to help him but this version of Maleva is not much help.  Her advice is to put Larry Talbot out of his misery.  Silver bullets no extra charge.

Quite a surprise as to who the other werewolf is (no spoilers here).  The duo werewolf smack-down will make any WWE fan proud.

Larry getting captured and locked up in a mental asylum was quite intense.  The director's view of psychiatry as a barbaric science with its use of ice-baths to cure delusion and sticking him with some kind of drugs has, unfortunately, not changed that much in 21st century psychiatric practice.  We've graduated to electro-shock treatments from ice-baths.  A true horror story.

The transformation of the man to wolf is great.  Memories of The American Werewolf in London will come to you, and naturally so, because Rick Baker had something to do with both films.  But where to the wolfman's clothes go?  Does he pick up after himself after each transformation?  But I digress.

As in the first Universal picture, there is a mild love interest.  It's a subdued, subplot however.

Anthony Hopkins (chewing up enough scenery to gorge on!) is delightfully demented as Sir Talbot, Sr.  The gothic mansion atop the hill with moon shining down in its full glory is so iconic -- and the fake time-lapse movement of our lunar neighbor as it glows through the dead tree branches and storm clouds brings back more memories of Universal pictures past.

Example:  The usual villagers with torches marching through the forest (with the baying dogs and such, reminiscent of Frankenstein).  The deep howl of the wolfman as he bays at the moon, as he gorges on the liver and intestines of his latest victim.  Oh, the hopping from the rooftops, again reminiscent of Henry Hall's wolfman, Werewolf of London (which predates Chaney's version).

The music evokes a mood and the plot moves along quite swiftly.  At times, the audience is surprised as if the director says ""boo"" out of a closet or something.  He does this a bit too often, but it's still fun to do.

If you are any kind of a Universal fan and have waited for a more adult treatment of this film, then you really should watch this film.  See how many iconic pictures you can spot as Universal digs deep into its vault of horror.

So don't be a cynic -- turn off your brain, don't think, and enjoy this bit of entertainment.

Warning: much gore and decapitations ensue!

I understand Bride of Frankenstein is coming soon.  Pray it ain't Anne Hathaway!

3601488,4,B001GCUO0W,"My dad is a big werewolf fan.  I wrote a book on werewolves. So the notion of bringing the Wolf Man back to the screen is near and dear to my heart.

This version is actually a new incarnation of the classic Wolf Man movie of 1941 from Universal Studios, which in turn was preceded by Werewolf of London. The new version incorporates elements from both movies. From Werewolf London, we get the origin of the werewolf originating in Tibet, dueling werewolves, and death by gun.  From the Wolf Man we get the Talbot family line, the ""wolfbane"" poem, and the silver wolf-headed walking stick.  Perhaps the biggest inspiration is the makeup itself, which eschews the now standard gorilla-werewolf transformation for a form that looks distinctly like the original Wolf Man makeup.

Shakespearian actor and American Lawrence Talbot (Benicio del Toro) returns to his family manor after a long separation at the bequest of his dead brother's fianc&eacute; Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt). Conliffe is central to the plot; she enamors Lawrence as well as his father, Sir John (Anthony Hopkins), and it is her presence or lack thereof that drives the lycanthropes to murder. As the body count rises, Francis Aberline of Scotland Yard (Hugo Weaving) arrives to solve the mystery.  The hunt is on, but who's hunting whom?

Benicio del Toro is undeniably wolfish-looking, but he seems wooden and out of his element compared to Blunt, who uses her big soulful eyes and gothic Victorian attire to good effect.  Unfortunately, they lack chemistry.  More imposing but erratic is Hopkins, who lends a cold menace to the cast.  Weaving doesn't have much to do but glare and shout orders, but then that's what we're accustomed to by now.  He does add ""horrified stare"" to his trademarked expression.

Interspersed throughout the mystery is the family rivalry between sons and father.  The best part of the movie takes place in an insane asylum. It provides an ironic take on lycanthropy as a mental disease and contrasts Victorian logic with the lurking world of magic and curses.

The Wolfman stays true to its roots.  This is not a remake as much as it is a reimagining, filled with lush backdrops, gloomy settings, ancient moors, and a Tim Burton soundtrack that pays homage to Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula.  This incarnation is a gothic period piece set in Victorian times

Unfortunately, you get the sense that this new version is very insecure about its choices. The movie isn't particularly scary -- the horror is meant to be from the doomed plight of the protagonist -- but it nevertheless resorts to random shrieks and jump cuts.  The Wolfman, while undeniably violent, transforms into an over-the-top death machine capable of tearing off heads and limbs with one swipe of his claws. This isn't just a new version of the Wolf Man, it's the Wolf Man on steroids.

Like Dracula, The Wolfman does not end well for any of its characters.  As a gothic romance the best we can hope for is a resolution, not a happy ending.  And that's exactly how it should be. The Wolfman respectfully carries a legacy of violent beasts on its hirsute shoulders, but mainstream audiences will probably hate it.",1266105600,2,3175,4.8752327746741155

3601490,5,B001GCUO0W,"""The Wolfman"" is great! This is how the story goes: Lawrence Talbot is a haunted nobleman lured back to his family estate after his brother vanishes. Reunited with his estranged father, Talbot sets out to find his brother...and discovers a horrifying destiny for himself.

Lawrence Talbot's childhood ended the night his mother died. After he left the sleepy Victorian hamlet of Blackmoor, he spent decades recovering and trying to forget. But when his brother's fiance, Gwen Conliffe, tracks him down to help find her missing love, Talbot returns home to join the search. He learns that something with brute strength and insatiable bloodlust has been killing the villagers, and that a suspicious Scotland Yard inspector named Abberline has come to investigate.

As he pieces together the gory puzzle, he hears of an ancient curse that turns the afflicted into werewolves when the moon is full. Now, if he has any chance at ending the slaughter and protecting the woman he has grown to love, Talbot must destroy the vicious creature in the woods surrounding Blackmoor. But as he hunts for the nightmarish beast, a simple man with a tortured past will uncover a primal side to himself...one he never imagined existed.

This is a great remake that is faithful to its original every aspect. The Oscar-winning make-up effects by Rick Baker are impressive. Benicio Del Toro & Anthony Hopkins are great in their roles.",1266019200,,4910,5.063040791100123
3601491,3,B001GCUO0W,"Howl in the hell did they screw this one up?  With this latest were-adaption we've got a monstrous budget, an outstanding cast, and a classic wolf script to feed on.  But somehow this Hollywood serving just doesn't come close to appeasing that voracious wolfman appetite.

It's not a complete disaster, and I imagine that many mainstream horror fans will be slightly entertained.  There are some drab 19th century London sets that capture a nice depressing feel.  The costumes also capture that era quite well.  Plus there are some decent gory action scenes that deliver some solid thrills.  Some noticeable CGI, but overall the effects were somewhat gripping and realistic.

Now for the bad.  This script was functional, at best.  The action is kinda slow-paced, with the dialogue sorta bland.  There's nothing too emotionally-charged or noteworthy happening whatsoever.  The acting performances in turn seemed very uninspired.  But really what pretty much ruined this movie for me were several plot developments that seemed eclipsed of all possible logic.  I won't include spoilers here, but some reactions to the disastrous werewolf problem seemed flat-out ridiculous.  There is a pointless romance that is clumsily included that's just atrocious.  And finally there is a horrible plot twist which is arbitrarily inserted that makes absolutely no sense.

Not a complete waste.  But I'd recommend saving your money, or at least wait for a rental.  Pick up the almighty DOG SOLDIERS instead.",1266019200,3,1492,5.272340425531915
3601492,5,B001GCUO0W,"Ok, before you disguard this as just another good review from a fan read what I have to say.

Two years ago, when I first heard that this movie was coming out, I was fairly excited about it.  Back then, a trailer had already leaked onto the internet and there was already some buzz about it because it was supposed to originally have been released in early 2009.

At the time, the movie was probably ready to go and as good as it could have been but, some studio executives were not satisfied enough with it.  That wanted it to be bigger, more epic, and so the project was delayed.  In fact, the project was delayed several times in order to give it more of an epic feel the studio executives felt it needed.

Unfortunately, this shows in the final product.  The scenes that were added in are fairly obvious and they are completely unrealistic at best and laughable at worst.  For instance, did you know that the wolfman originally walked on two legs for the whole movie and there were no silly scenes where he was on four legs looking like a rabid gorilla?

However, the movie itself, and I am not talking about the cgi, is pretty good.  The beginning is scary, the acting is first rate, and I found when I wasn't staring at a cgi created hairy man I was actually enjoying the movie.  The suspense when Lawrence is a man and not a beast is great but unfortunately, when he becomes the wolf the story loses its pace and somewhat falters a little.

This should be a lesson that bigger is not always better.  Sometimes you just got to let things be and let the actors make things feel real instead of try to show things that are just hard to do.

I give this movie 5 stars based on the fact that, aside from the over accessive cgi usage it is a great movie.  You just have to forgive the idiots who tried to turn the movie into something it isnt.",1266019200,4,1844,4.273775216138328
3601493,3,B001GCUO0W,"Bad dog.  If there's anything to be said in defense of ""The Wolfman,"" it's that it's another movie with potential f****d over by the studio.  That's all the defense the film deserves.  It doesn't take a full moon to illuminate where the production went wrong.  Joe Johnston is a nice guy and a good director who shoots movies that look pretty--he knows how to use shadow, that's for sure--and fills them with characters no deeper than celluloid itself.  He's also studio-friendly: his films are well-received critically and profitable financially, which is why he won out as director in the end.  In hiring Johnston, Universal got a director they could feel safe with.  They also sabotaged the potential for a film with vision and, well, worth.

The worthiest aspects of Johnston's ""Wolfman,"" as it is, are two men: Hugo Weaving, who manages to give a Scotland Yard inspector as thin as the paper the script was printed on a faade of life, and Rick Baker, who designed the makeup effects.  Anyone familiar with the Werewolf film will know Baker, whose epochal effects for John Landis' ""An American Werewolf in London"" won the first Best Makeup Effects Oscar in 1982.  His effects for ""The Wolfman"" were stunted by the studio like a plant without fertilizer or water.  Baker's work in ""American Werewolf"" is proof of the vast superiority of physical makeup effects to the modern-day computer-generated imagery, the latter being the method Universal forced him to use.  Nonsense.  The resulting effects generate more thrills than the other aspects of the film, but look hopelessly crude compared to the effects Baker designed--and executed, physically--almost thirty years ago.  All one can say about Weaving is that the liveliness he's able to wring from his talking clich is nobility like the screen has rarely seen.

Which directs attention to the script, that which attracted me to the project when it went in to development half a decade ago, since it's written by ""Seven""'s Andrew Kevin Walker.  The script was touched up prior to filming by David Self, unfortunately, whom I think must to be blame for many of its shortcomings.  As translated to the screen, the script has flashes of almost exciting vision, flashes rapidly less frequent as the film progresses.  Most of the time, the plot takes leaps forward, trips on a sidestep, goes nowhere, and then leaves a hole so wide the monster from a far better monster movie, ""Cloverfield,"" could crouch inside it.  The plot seems unsatisfactory in the middle of the film and obnoxious at its end.  Some scenes make no sense and suggest Self patchwork that would do David ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" Koepp proud.  Cliches are a pack of wolves roaming across the screenplay.  The cliches aren't as offensive as the scenes all-too-obviously stolen from Landis' ""American Werewolf in London,"" and they certainly aren't so embarrassing as the painfully stupid werewolf fight I'd prayed the film was smart enough to avoid.  Could be the stupid/stolen action-injected scenes became a necessity once Danny Elfman delivered his score, supposedly a homage to Wojciech Kilar's score for Francis Ford Coppola's ""Dracula,"" proof that Elfman has revealed himself as a long-since-spent theme-meister whose scores stink.

As does this film, whether you see it as a rehash, a standalone picture, or, ugh, worst of all, the incumbent counterpart to Coppola's ""Dracula""--now there was a remake.  Coppola's ""Dracula"" pulsed with sex, bizarrity, and, since those are two of its central components, life.  ""The Wolfman"" is nowhere near as bizarre as I'd like it--the weirdest it gets is some gore, which livens things up just enough to make me grateful the studio went with the R-rated version, and a trippy dream sequence that creeped me out enough for me to consider it successful--and it's about as sexy as a mossy old soda can in the middle of a marsh.  Which, with the soda can as completely unrounded character and the marsh providing opportunities for shadows and pretty visuals, might make fitting subject matter for Joe Johnston's next project.  Just leave ""Frankenstein"" alone.",1265932800,8,4142,5.042584434654919
3601494,3,B001GCUO0W,"It should have worked.  An incredible cast delivering academy worthy performances, aided by brilliant cinematography, tackling an adaptation of a classic that is both loyal to the original source and yet different as well should have been all the ingredients needed to create a box office classic.

It should have worked, but it didn't.

Here's where I feel the film went wrong and took away from all the other great aspects that it was doing right.  If these aren't the kinds of issues that would bother you in a film, then you may very well end up loving this new adaptation of The Wolfman:

1. THE BREAK-NECK SPEED.  The first forty or so minutes of the film fly by like an extended movie trailer, full of quick edits, sped up and slowed down zoom ins and outs, and a script that functions more as a summary than as a story.  The characters are given almost no personality (though the actors work so hard to compensate for this), the plot line lacks complexity, and we're given absolutely no time to absorb mood, theme, nor emotions.  When the film finally does slow down to a normal speed (after the Wolfman's second outing), the brilliant cinematography and acting finally take center stage, and the film becomes enjoyable for quite a while.  I wish it had started this way.

2. THE CG EFFECTS.  The effects are actually reasonably well done.  I just don't think the technology is at a point where it can hold its own against the film's dense, artistic visuals, nor the heavy, atmospheric acting of Del Toro, Hopkins, Blunt, and Weaving.  The Wolfman looks plain silly and out of place in contrast to all the cinematic art happening around him.  This is particularly true at the film's climax (which I will not give away) where an intensely dramatic confrontation is utterly ruined by the unceremonious introduction of base computer generation.  This isn't Avatar, and those kinds of effects don't work here.

3.  THE PLOT.  The original Wolf Man film walked a careful tightrope between the fantastic and the realistic to the point that we were almost left to wonder whether or not Larry Talbot's transformations were real.  I praise this adaptation for trying to do something different and thus plunging the film head-on into the realm of the fantastic where everything is surreal and incredible, but I think they went too far.  Between the absurdly sadistic asylum and the over-the-top (yet not-so-surprising) revelation about who the other werewolf is, the film just begins to feel silly, all while so many other elements in the film work hard to make it feel serious and credible.

In the end, I suppose there are two ways to handle a werewolf film -- make it ridiculous and exciting, or make it seem somewhat believable and artistically important.  The Wolfman attempts to do both at the same time, looking far more serious than its source film while delivering a far more absurd storyline.  It may work for you but, as far as I'm concerned, this Wolfman has failed to leave his mark.",1265932800,4,2994,4.75968992248062
3601495,4,B001GCUO0W,"The Wolfman stays true to the old fashioned look and story of the original, but this time it's in color and we get folks being ripped apart piece by piece. The level of gore caught me be surprise. I knew there would be some to earn it's R rating, but limbs and heads leaving bodies and sailing through the air had my full gorehound attention. Rick Baker is still the man when it comes to creature makeup. He kept the original look from the 1941 version, only he added enough changes to make it far more menacing. Benicio Del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Emily Blunt and Hugo Weaving are all in cruise mode here. None of them turn in a bad performance, but nothing memorable either. Still, the acting is fairly solid all around. The set design and cinematography add plenty of gothic vibe to establish a nice eerie mood. Most of the scares are the cheesy kind, you know, where something jumps out of nowhere and makes a loud noise. There is a good mixture of practical effecs and CGI (some good, some average), but I'm glad they kept the CGI to a minimum. The werewolf transformations are very good here and look painful. Francis Ford Coppola had a much better take on an old monster classic when he made Bram Stoker's Dracula back in 1992, but Joe ""Jurassic Park III"" Johnston did a better job than I thought he would in resurrecting this beast for modern audiences. It comes across well as an old fashioned horror tale, but with huge doses of animalistic violence and bloodletting, leaving no doubt that this is The Wolfman you shouldn't pet, but fear.

3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars",1265932800,3,1573,4.480836236933798
3601496,5,B001GCUO0W,"Horror buffs, you don't want to miss this excellent adaptation of the 1941 Universal Studios classic.  Stellar performances by Benicio Del Toro (Lawrence Talbot), Anthony Hopkins (his father) and Emily Blunt (his love interest), make this a millennium classic from the get-go.  Be sure to see it on the big screen.  I spilled my popcorn three times (thank goodness I bought the large refillable box).  And many kudos to the movie sets and costumes of 1891 England.  But, please don't bring the kids.  It's rated ""R"" for all the right reasons (horror fans that is).  There's lots of flesh-ripping gore and up-front out-of-the dark terror.  The tragic storyline will remind of you of another horror classic - ""King Kong"".  If you recall (without giving away the plot), the last line in the original Kong was:  ""It wasn't the planes that got him, it was beauty that killed the beast.""  All 5 stars.  We need more true horror films like this.",1265932800,4,938,4.79375
3601497,3,B001GCUO0W,"I'm a connoisseur of werewolf movies; as a kid I watched all the old Universal Wolfman movies with Lon Chaney Jr. as the tormented Lawrence Talbot until they ran it down into things like Abbot and Costello Meets the Wolfman. In the late 70's early 80's there was a resurgence in were-wolf movies, The Howling, An American WereWolf In London, Wolfen among others so I was really looking forward to The Wolfman.

The Wolfman has Benicio Del Toro playing Lawrence Talbot, the prodigal son of Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins), summoned back to the family's decaying estate in England after the murder of his brother. Investigating the murder, Lawrence meets and falls in love with his brother's fianc Gwen (Emily Blunt) and runs afoul of a werewolf, surviving the attack but cursing him to become a werewolf every full moon.

The Wolfman tries to mix too many elements, Gothic atmosphere, a little Freud, ghost children, a decaying estate, deep dark family secrets, Victorian asylums, Gypsies, curses, frightened townspeople, werewolf movie lore, and the ingredients don't mix quite right. The Wolfman also borrows from modern werewolf movie lore incorporating the febrile dreams used to greater effect in An American Werewolf in London. Lawrence is taken to a London asylum where the doctors ""get Victorian"" on Lawrence with their treatments. It's in the asylum that we see the first real transformation of Lawerence into the wolfman. He's wheeled into a filled  operating theater for observation as the full moon rises, and Lawerence vows he'll kill them all. Unfortunately, the scene evokes more chuckles than terror or horror.

Del Toro as Lawrence turns in a solid performance as Lawrence, but doesn't deliver the tortured soul that fears becoming The Wolfman. Benicio Del Toro is a much better actor than Lon Chaney Jr's heavy handed Lawerence Talbot was, but I think Chaney's Talbot was much better at conveying this element of the wolfman.  The love affair between Lawerence and Gwen is hampered by there being very little chemistry between Del Toro and Emily Blunt, whose love must save Lawrence from the curse, we never quite believe or see how these two have fallen in love. I think this Wolfman may assume the viewer knows much of the mythology and provides only the outlines of the characters. Hugo Weaving plays Inspector Aberline, fresh off the Jack The Ripper case, who doesn`t believe in curses and werewolves but suspects Lawrence of being the lunatic murderer he`s searching for. Anthony Hopkins seems to chew the scenery (pardon the pun and the clich) as Sir John, but it's a much different role than the Claude Rains' Sir John of the 1941 original. Hopkins seems to be taking the roundabout way of being the modern Karlov or Lugosi, he was in Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula, as well as that modern monster Hannibal Lecter.

Rick Baker did the make-up on The Wolfman, and you can see Del Toro's face in The Wolfman make-up (maybe The Wolfman looks a little too pretty). Director Joe Johnston who was formerly a storyboard artist for George Lucas is great on atmosphere and mood and does better on the technical end than the performance.",1265932800,5,3154,4.952741020793951
