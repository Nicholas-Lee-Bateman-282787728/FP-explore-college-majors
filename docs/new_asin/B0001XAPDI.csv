8017844,5,B0001XAPDI,"The 2 stars in this film, Pedro Infante and Sofia Alvarez, serve up a terrific selection of songs, including 2 knock-out duets, that make ""Si Me Han de Matar Manana"" a tasty treat for anyone who likes mariachi music. Sofia Alvarez (1913-1985), who was born in Colombia, gets top billing in this film, and though her fame wasn't a lasting one like Infante's, she is marvelous, with rare beauty, good singing voice, and stylish grace. She was to make 2 other films with Infante the same year, ""Barca de Oro,"" and ""Soy Charro de Rancho Grande.""  The plot is stretched a bit thin, revolving around Lupita (Alvarez), who was kidnapped as a child, and is found by her father General Reyes (Miguel Arenas)...right before an assassination attempt on his life...singing in a cantina, owned by bad guy Genovevo (Rene Cardona), who wants to marry her. Enter Ramiro (Infante), who has blonde Fanny (Nelly Montiel) trying to ""catch"" him. Chicote is Ramiro's funny sidekick, and the story goes round and round, as many lovely songs are sung.

Favorite musical numbers are the ""Bajo el sol de Jalisco"" duet sung at a palenque (the squeamish should be warned there is a cock fight before it), the gorgeous solo by Infante with a trio at Fanny's party, and the ""dueling verses"" duet that follows it at the cantina.  Director Miguel Zacarias also wrote the script, music is by Miguel Esperon, and the acting by all is fine in this delightful comedic romantic romp. The b&w film quality is quite clear and sharp, but the audio unfortunately shows its age a bit, and is at times quite fuzzy, though the songs still shine despite the sound deterioration.  Both stars look wonderful, and Infante fans will love this film. No subtitles available.
Pedro Infante (1917-1957), was Mexico's most loved singer/actor, and 50 years after his untimely passing when he crashed his plane in the Yucatan, he reigns supreme, and his many films and recordings are national treasures.",1175904000,3,1947,4.855421686746988
