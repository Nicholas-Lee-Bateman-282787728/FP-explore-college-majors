7725988,2,B01DX0GQBA,"This was my second order of S21 Amazing Race.  None of the discs (order 1 or order 2) would play on any of our DVD players.  Had audio only, no video, or picture.  Spoke with very nice rep at Amazon, but she was unable to explain what was causing this problem.  Very frustrated.  Amazon chiefs, this is something you need to look into and fix, based on postings by several people about this very problem.",1483747200,5,404,4.333333333333333
7725989,5,B01DX0GQBA,Love this show,1483660800,,14,4.0
7725990,5,B01DX0GQBA,I bought this on Blu-Ray. Great Quality. Thanks for putting it out in HD format. Looking forward to my other pre-orders being released sometime soon (hint hint amazon),1483574400,,167,5.0
7725991,3,B01DX0GQBA,"Plays on computer, plays on blue ray.  Will not play the video portion on my dvd player...audio only.  Then, it just cuts out completely.  I also had issues with the latest Survivor that was released.  Would not play special features...none of therm.  Something is different about the way they are encoding and producing these new disks.",1483142400,2,337,4.946428571428571
7725992,1,B01DX0GQBA,Many problems with disc set. Amazon said they will look into it. But I have not enjoyed at all. Will not play on my dvd player.,1482796800,5,127,3.923076923076923
7725993,1,B01DX0GQBA,"We received our DVD, Amazing Race Season 21 from Amazon. When played on a computer it works fine but when played on my TV by either of my DVD Players it has audio only when playing the actual episode. The video portion is missing with the screen blank. This is the same problem we had on 2 of the survivor episodes Season 21, Redemption Island and Season 22, South Pacific in 2015. It's no fun for my family to watch it from a laptop. I find it hard to believe that after the Survivor fiasco the same problem occurred. We have other Survivor and Amazing Race DVDs ordered and hope we can watch them on the TV as Indicated in your product details.",1482364800,7,646,4.260162601626016
8757180,1,B01DX0GQBA,"If you buy the DVD version of this product, it would be wise to immediately test each disk in your DVD player. I purchased this product in 2017, but I didn't have time to watch it for several months. I was dismayed to find that none of the DVD disks worked in my DVD player. I missed my chance to return the product--if your disks don't work, please don't miss the chance to return yours.",1530748800,,388,4.1866666666666665
8757181,3,B01DX0GQBA,Good to have for TAR fans but price too much for anyone else especially since they're MTO with no extras,1518393600,,104,4.25
8757182,1,B01DX0GQBA,"Terrible quality DVD.  The picture is a bright green mess.  Thought Amazon would have straightened out this problem, but clearly they haven't.  Same problem with Season 20.  Both are being sent back for refund.",1513296000,,210,5.088235294117647
8757183,1,B01DX0GQBA,Don't buy it! They are defective when buying from Azmazon. They will not play on your DVD player at all. Don't waste your time!,1497312000,,127,4.333333333333333
8757184,2,B01DX0GQBA,"after reading other reviews...I thought maybe they had old players or something..so thought to just give it a shot myself....my copy is the regular dvd and not blue ray version...maybe the blue ray would be better but what I got was horrible. It comes across as a copy of a copied dvd. The dvd was a dvd+r which is a rewritable format dvd. The sound was rough and hard to make out what was said often times...you can not subtitle this dvd to help..and if you stop the dvd, the dvd has to be restarted from the beginning. It comes across as a bad pirated copy of the show (and maybe it is). Saying all this.... if you really want to see the show and have no problem with the bad recording, then go for it.....but if your standards make it hard to deal with all the problems....then skip it or maybe try the blue ray and see if it is a legal copy.",1489795200,2,845,4.158536585365853
8757185,3,B01DX0GQBA,I love this show but once again Amazon is using discs that do not work on all DVD players. I can watch this one on my computer but I would prefer watching through my DVD player. Amazon...please go back to using the DVDs you used to use years ago.,1489363200,,246,4.040816326530612
8757186,2,B01DX0GQBA,"Add me to the list of frustrated buyers who can hear the audio, but have no video for this product.  I really want to support the release of The Amazing Race on DVD, but will no longer do so due to this substandard product.",1487376000,2,223,4.068181818181818
8757187,5,B01DX0GQBA,Really enjoyed it - roll on season 22 - and where's season 20?,1485043200,,62,3.8461538461538463
8757188,1,B01DX0GQBA,"I'm a huge Amazing Race fan. Always look forward to new seasons getting released (which is another completely different issue - Amazon, don't keep them on ""Pre-order"" for a YEAR). Season 21 is a complete train wreck. The discs don't play right, there's only audio and no video, and I can see from the reviews I'm not the only one. Don't waste your time or money until Amazon gets this fixed. The season itself is great, but the DVDs are HORRIBLE. :(

P.S. So far I've been shipped THREE replacement sets - all with the same problem.",1483920000,2,532,4.484536082474227
8757189,4,B01DX0GQBA,First one released on Blu Ray (Finally!). Great picture quality. Can't wait for other AR's and Survivors on blu ray... what's the hold up?,1483747200,2,138,4.791666666666667
