8186019,5,6305150303,"I love this video although it is only 30 minutes in length and Jackyl recently released a live DVD performance.

Songs performed are as follows: I Stand Alone, The Lumberjack (with chainsaw as an instrument), Down On Me, When Will It Rain, and Dirty Little Mind (live).

Dirty Little Mind is performed gratis in a stripmall parking lot on a flatbed truck. The local law enforcement gets in on the action as well!!",1127692800,,413,4.6438356164383565
