8441525,5,B004UFPLH8,I bought this for a special needs young adult who loves farm animals.  This DVD is very nicely done and very educational.  I would recommend it for older children as well.  Great pictures of the animals and how they live.,1347062400,,221,4.475
8441526,5,B004UFPLH8,"Like the other reviewer, I first learned about beebright from a short segment on YouTube that highlighted shearing sheep.  I had to find out how to get my own copy - as my kids were riveted and asked to watched it daily!  I figured that an entire DVD would be loved and that it would be something both my husband and I would enjoy watching with them (we both grew up on farms in the Midwest).  And I was right.  The DVD was pricier than some, but has been worth every single penny. I am very picky about what I let my kids watch and this is very well done and very educational.  I love how each segment is the perfect length (30 min. or so).  In all there is 4 segments that highlight a different animal (cows, pigs, chickens, and sheep).  The narrator - the footage is live on a farm - is easy to listen to with a British accent, and very informative.  I love that there is also machinery involved since that is the highlight for my son.  Needless to say we are huge fans and now are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the Incredible Crops DVD in the mail! (I ordered that one thru the beebright website as Amazon doesnt carry it).  As a side note, since this was made in the UK there will be some things that are different.  Most notably are their different weights and measurements used when describing things.  I don't see this as a negative though, because I like that my children are getting exposed to other aspects of the world.",1326067200,,1435,4.274074074074074
