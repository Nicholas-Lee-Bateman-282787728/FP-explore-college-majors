8626977,5,B00GSTHCDU,"Of the various classic wrestling videos I have seen, this is the best so far.  It appears to be a revised and expanded (to over 4  hours on two DVDs) version of The Glory Days of Wrestling two cassette set.  It starts off with one of the most famous wrestlers of all, Gorgeous George.  You get the full Gorgeous George routine from his valet spraying the ring with disinfectant/perfume, his entrance with music and an elaborate robe that resembles a dress, throwing bobby pins to the crowd, and all of the rest of it.  There is also the Match of the Century between champion Pat OConnor and Buddy Rogers in Comisky Park about a quarter century before the first Starcade or Wrestlemania..  Among the other veterans of the past include Bruno Sammartino, Antonino Argentina Rocca, Killer Kowalski, Edourd (Ed) Carpentier, Verne Gagne, Bobo Brazil, Andre the Giant, Haystacks Calhoun, The Fabulous Kangaroos, Dick The Bulldog Brower, Yukon Eric, (Dick the)Bruiser and the Crusher, The Blackjacks (with manager Bobby Heenan), Handsome Johnny Berend, Primo Carnera and many others.  There are tag teams, six man tag teams, a Detroit Battle Royal, a cage match and female midget wrestlers. The bonus features include wrestling footage from newsreels and even a comedy short about professional wrestling.",1467849600,5,1296,5.084905660377358
