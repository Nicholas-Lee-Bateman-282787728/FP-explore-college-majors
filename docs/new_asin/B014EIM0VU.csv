8730482,1,B014EIM0VU,Okay story.  But the acting was the worst that I have ever seen to the point it was extremely distracting.  The actor were completely disconnected form their characters and they were basically just saying the lines.  I also think there was too much to this story and would have been much better as a 10 minute short.,1495756800,,316,4.508771929824562
