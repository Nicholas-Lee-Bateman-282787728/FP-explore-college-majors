8285761,1,B0012DT2BM,"(Note: I was trying to give this bomb a ""0"" rating, but Amazon's website wouldn't allow that). Anyway, this is no doubt the absolute worst travel video I've seen to date - and I've seen some real bad ones. The only thing that stopped me from turning it off after the first 5 minutes was the hope that it would eventually get better.., it didn't., it just got worse. The only redeeming thing about this DVD is you do get to see some of Haleakala's stunning beauty. However, the aimless & haphazard manner in which the various scenes were edited together, the fact that the director didn't do ANY shooting down on the floor of this magnificent crater where there are miles & miles of trails with mesmerizing scenes & views that make you think you're on another planet, and the fact that the commentator mis-pronouced Haleakala throughout the entire film, makes anyone who has been to this wonderful place wonder ""what in the world were these guys thinking when they made this thing?"" If everything mentioned thus far isn't bad enough, the hokey soundtrack they put on this DVD absolutely pushed it into the category of ""a 12-year old could have done better."" After watching this thing, I was sure that it was one of those ""one & only"" videos made by some unknown company, etc. Then, I noticed on Amazon that this same production company has many other travel DVD videos for sale. Geez.., I sincerely hope those guys did a better job with their other travel videos because they really laid a big ole stinking egg with this one.",1254873600,,1524,4.606617647058823
