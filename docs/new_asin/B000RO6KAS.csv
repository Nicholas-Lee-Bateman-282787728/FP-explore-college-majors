2871118,5,B000RO6KAS,"I really don't think the person who rated the show two stars seen very much of it, or had some sort of bias before even seeing it. You can't expect the show to be just like the movies. It just never happens that way. But that doesn't mean its automatically worse. No, Blade: The Series was made by the same person who made the movies, and he did just as well if not better on the series. The acting was great, the look was great, environment, everything. This show was easily better than most shows on the air.
The person who gave two stars stated that the show was cancelled due to bad reviews and fan dislike. Thats pretty much a total lie. The fans loved the show, and the only reason Spike cancelled it was because the sponsor companies were aiming their advertising at men and incidentally there was about as many women watching the show as men. Spike TV is dubbed a mens network, and so many women watching the show was quite unexpected, therefore the ads weren't geared for women.
All alround, this was a real good show. I can only hope the whole series comes out on DVD, and if we're lucky maybe a continuation!",1189900800,9,1119,4.358851674641149
2871119,4,B000RO6KAS,"I happened to catch the Blade marathon on Spike TV and I loved the show. It was fast-paced and I thought it did translate well. It wasn't the gore fest of the movies, but it was slick and adult. I was saddened to see the show go away, so I hope this signals a return of some sort. I still think Spike TV gave up on the show too quick.",1189814400,12,334,3.7857142857142856
2871120,4,B000RO6KAS,"The guy that said the fan didn't like is must be insane..or blind.  Go check we and you can read forums for the fans that actually what they are mad is because Blade was not aired anymore, about the poor ratings thats a stupidy since what good things brings spiketv? reapeating and reapeting movies that people own or don't care anymore.",1189555200,4,337,4.524590163934426
2871121,5,B000RO6KAS,"I couldn't disagree more with the reviewer who gave this two stars.

1. It's easily BETTER than the movies.  I had almost every bit as much action as the movies (understandably a little less given TV's relative budget), but the plot, storyline, and acting were FAR superior.  It didn't have the logic problems that some of the movies did (i.e., in Blade 1 where the woman gets up and keeps fighting and shooting guns even after losing a ton of blood; or  Blade Trinity where mortal human heroes were going toe-to-toe with vampires, blocking their punches, etc.).

2. It captures everything that's RIGHT about the Buffy/sci-fi-horror genre while leaving out all of the stuff that's WRONG with it.  There's plenty of action and hot women, but absolutely NO campiness, tackiness, or cheesy-ness.  No stupid teenage humor (which Blade Trinity, unfortunately, had WAAAY too much of with the male human sidekick whose name I don't recall).

3.  The plot was absolutely excellent.  Any number of the episodes kept always you guessing at where things were going.  There were threads within threads and conflicts within conflicts: Blade's overall battle with the vampires; the vampires' internecine feuds amongst themselves, Jill Wagoner's vampire heroine character's struggle with her own vampirism;  And on top of this, they managed to make these disparate conflicts harmonize into the overall storyline rather than meander.

Sure, the story started a BIT slow, but so did HEROES for crying out loud and look what a phenomenon THAT became!  The only reason Blade the Series didn't last in the same way is that it had to have been more expensive  to produce.  I mean, explosions, bullets, action scenes, and exploding cars tend to add up and Spike just didn't have NBC's financial resources.  It's not that this show didn't do WELL, it just didn't do well ENOUGH to cover the huge bill it racked up.

I'd highly urge people who haven't seen this show to do so and either buy this DVD or the full season when it comes out.  DVD sales saved Family Guy and maybe they'll bring back this brilliant, but unappreciated show as well!",1188086400,5,2118,4.898876404494382
2871122,5,B000RO6KAS,"I thought the show was great.  The first hip hop cd I ever bought on my own was ONYX, so I was a fan of Sticky, but it did take some adjustment to see him as Blade.  I don't think it was his fault, Wesley Snipes created the role like Christopher Reeves did Superman, Michael Keaton did Batman or even how Robert Englunds did Freddy.  There is a new Superman and Batman, but (especially in Superman Returns) the standard was set with the original movies.  Wesley Snipes is Blade, it will take alot to take that title from him.  With that said, Sticky technically played Blade like Snipes... very little dialogue, moody, mean, and no emotion.  The main difference is that I was always aware that Snipes is a martial artist and Sticky got beat up by some fat rock kid on a mtv show back in the day.  Anyways... it wasn't the pilot, but at some point I didn't even think about the differences and just accepted Sticky as Blade.  Like most shows, the first season is good, but I had a feeling the second season was going to take it to the next level.  The show was indepth with Blades history... and there was even an epsiode (my favorite) that gave indepth look into Marcus history.  There was some good episodes, good characters, and good effects.  Blade and Blade II are classics in my book, but Blade III was poorly directed and edited... watchable only because I'm a fan.  In my opionion this tv show would've saved the Blade Saga, because Blade III killed my interest in seeing another movie.  I'm probably buying this disc, but I'm not sure if I should wait for the whole series to come out.  Then again they might release all of them like this one.",1186012800,5,1651,4.405940594059406
2871123,4,B000RO6KAS,"Blade: the Series is currently playing on HDNet. I watched the first three episodes and was totally hooked. I downloaded the rest of the episodes from iTunes and watched them all over the space of about a week. I regret having missed the show when it was running on Spike. I think the show's creators did a really good job of translating the movies to television, and the show itself was a little more adult than most basic cable fare.

Unlike some of the other reviewers, I think the production values and acting in the show were just fine. While I initially had some problems adjusting to Kirk Jones as Blade, I think he improved a lot as the season wore on and was good at conveying Blade's reluctant caring and his gruff exterior. I was especially impressed with Jill Wagner, who plays Kirsta Starr, Blade's spy in the House of Chthon. Wagner was equally convincing wearing a evening gown or kicking butt in blue jeans and a t-shirt. In the first half of the two-hour pilot episode, Wagner wears blue jeans and carries a gun. About halfway through, she shows up at a party wearing a spectacular white dress. Wow. She's a gorgeous gal. Of the series regulars, only Jessica Gower, who plays one of the key vampires, struck me as a little wooden.

I do have some plot issues. Emily Hirst plays Charlotte, a pure-blood vampire, born a vampire instead of being turned like most of the others. Hirst is 13 or so, and her character is supposed to be 200. Do pure blood vampires grow old, maybe at a slower pace than humans? The other pure blood vampires shown in the series are all adults of different ages. I don't really understand the concept. Another gripe: during the pilot, Krista has a sniper rifle loaded with silver-tipped ammo aimed at Marcus Van Sciver's head, but instead of just blasting him, she insists on taunting him over a two-way radio she's left behind. Of course, we know what that means...

Quibbles aside, I enjoyed the show a lot, and I am sorry it only lasted one season. I would like to know what happens next. Maybe if enough people buy this DVD of the pilot episode, we can get a few direct-to-DVD movies made featuring the same cast.",1184284800,17,2159,4.530769230769231
2871124,4,B000RO6KAS,"..yet not enough! Blade the TV Series was actually pretty good. Now, I'm not a geek enough to look past bad production values for shows I really want to like. But to be honest, Blade wasn't all that bad! At times, it was really good! Sure, it wasn't the movies. But if you went into the TV show thinking that it was going to be the movies, then you deserve whatever disappointment you got. What Blade the TV Series did was take the world created in the movies and go into further details. The whole warring factions, the houses, the characters were really good! Sticky was a great Blade. And all the supporting characters were well done!

I liked the show. I was pissed it got canceled. It just needed a little more time and a little TLC. Obviously, Spike TV felt it needed more male viewers.",1183593600,32,792,4.387755102040816
2871125,2,B000RO6KAS,"With Wesley Snipes having enough of being Blade, the series and Marvel character made the transformation from feature film series to television.  Blade: House of Chthon is the pilot of the TV series that premiered on Spike TV, and featured rapper Kirk ""Sticky Fingaz"" Jones as the super human vampire hunter, which in itself helps kill the series right off the bat.  Blade teams up with Iraq war veteran Krista (Jill Wagner, better known as the girl from the Mercury car commercials) whose brother was a vampire familiar and was murdered for something he knew.  This leads them to a powerful and dangerous vamp named Marcus Van Sciver (Neil Jackson) who has big plans for both species.  Though it had film trilogy writer David S. Goyer and celebrated comic writer Geoff Johns behind it, the Blade series just never excelled the way it could have, and this pilot is no different.  The acting is pretty bad all around, and the overall story never picked up and got really interesting until the end of the series, and by that time, it was already too late.  Jones just comes off as lame and just doesn't have that opposing charisma that Snipes posessed, plus the Blade character just seems so weak willed compared to what we've seen before.  There are some good ideas, hot women (Wagner and Jessica Gower), and some nifty TV effects as well, but in the end, this is an ultimate failure.  Not to mention that it's inevitable for the whole series to make it's way to DVD, of which this pilot will most likely be included.  If you're a Blade fan and missed the series when originally aired, this may be worth a look, and if you were one of the few who actually enjoyed the series (it was canceled due to poor ratings and the overall negative reactions from fans of the films), this ""extended"" DVD may be worth picking up.",1183161600,22,1815,4.594427244582043

2871186,2,B000RO6KAS,"I really don't understand how this show got any good reviews. The first thing that came to my mind as I watched the house of chthon is that this Jones guy is the black William Shatner of acting. This guy just gruffly whispers every line he has in the movie, trying to sound tough, and it's just ridiculous. At least Shatner knew he was overacting and turned it into a comedy career. This guy thinks he's Wesley Snipes. He has no personality and while watching the movie, I didn't really care if he died or not. I love the first three Blade movies, but I just completely lost interest with this one. Don't waste your money on this movie or the series.",1405641600,3,650,4.336065573770492

2871215,1,B000RO6KAS,"I really like the Blade TV series as short-lived as it was. When I saw this DVD I thought maybe I'd missed a movie that came out after the series, the information here on Amazon and on the DVD itself suggested this was a stand alone movie.

It is NOT. It is the pilot episodes for the series.  So if you are getting the DVD of the series, don't get this.

Also be warned that these two episodes or pilot movie has some serious problems with how they are formatted and it appears to be on purpose. While I could get the other episodes to play on my computer and any of the DVD players in our house, the first two episodes, this ""movie"" would only play on certain machines.

2871218,4,B000RO6KAS,"Set a few months after the conclusion of the original Blade trilogy, Blade:House of Chthon tries to make a statement in the mythology previously initiated in the movies. It appeals for the audiences of the previous movies, but also for the new ones. And serves it all of the things you have previously seen: hot vampire chicks, car chases, intense fights and the typical subplot of ""we suck blood and we want to rule humans"".

The problem here is: It feels like a much lighter version. All in Blade:House of Chthon feels like down to tone. Yes, you can envision Kirk Jones as Blade, but Wesley Snipes got us a very hard image of the character to retreat now. Jessica Gower works fine in his character Krista, a double agent for Blade in the vampire world; but sometimes one feels that she is only a sidekick and others the true protagonist of the series...but hey, it's Blade The Series, right? or we should call it Krista The Series?

I really want to know what David Goyer wanted to do with the franchise. Maybe he was very busy writing ""Batman Begins"". Anyway, this DVD is only for Blade die hard fans, and a good excuse to lose a few hours. Give it a chance and you won't be dissapointed.",1225497600,,1192,4.463302752293578

Alot of people I know didn't watch the series because they knew the main guy as a rapper.  Don't let it detract you if that's the case.  He made a good Blade.  Alot of the other characters were really good as well.  It's worth seeing.. just for Neil Jackson alone.",1224806400,,535,4.5

This DVD seems to be a way for New Line to test the waters and see if there is still enough support for the series that a full release of it could happen, which I am hoping for. My only man beef with this DVD is the fact that this was the exact same thing shown UNCUT when Spike first aired it. I think the only thing from memory from that time and watching this DVD that I actually saw ""unrated"" and different was the fact the tattoo scene had the woman getting up with her big breasts exposed.

Wow... that was the ""Unrated Extended Version Too Graphic for TV"", which aside from the 5 second full frontal nudity was the exact same ""uncut"" version when it first aired and played during the late night for Spike.

Overall, I was impressed by Sticky's performance as Blade, the storyline(and even the flashback footage from the 1st Blade film) gave it an authentic feel, I was feelin' the crime family approach to the vampire clan(Chthon), and I agree with many of the other reviews that it was cut off too soon...there was so much more potential left for the series to grow and become a classic out of this world. However, my review is short 2 stars, and this is just my opinion, because 2 areas were lacking in the series premiere: (1)Sticky vs Wesley: While Wesley Snipes, a martial artist in his own right, had Blade lookin' like a black Neo, my boy Sticky was lookin' like he was havin' a hard time shakin' off the underlings...no fault of his own, but the fight choreography could've been more convincing to make him look like the daywalker his character is supposed to be...(2)between the open and close, the progression tends to be quite drawn out and slow with some action/murder spurts here and there...which was about the only thing that caused the series premiere to stand out like a sore thumb in comparison/contrast to the movie trilogy.
Don't get me wrong...I agree that Sticky has the charisma to be Blade, but I feel that they didn't work with him as intensely as they did with Wesley.",1190332800,2,1645,4.617747440273037

I'm hoping they release the entire series in a boxed set and then, at least some kind of conclusion to the explosive, cliffhanger season finale.
