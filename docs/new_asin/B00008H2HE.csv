1847186,1,B00008H2HE,"It's hard to believe that some of the reviews posted here are referring to the same videos. I found this entire series to be extremely one dimensional. These videos are passive eye stimulation at best as they provide no challenge to young viewers. The footage used appears to be stock footage of some sort and the toys featured are not always age appropriate. The parenting guide is insulting, even to new parents. How any of the baby superstar videos won any award begs the question - what exactly is the criteria used to judge these products?",1056585600,2,544,4.677083333333333
1847187,5,B00008H2HE,"As a teacher, I ordered the video after hearing that it was Parenting Magazine's video of the year winner.  This is a great video for babies and will definitely help my son.  He loves watching the video over and over, and I believe that it is helping his mental development.  I was suprised that there was a parent's guide hosted by Dr. Joyce Brothers and thought that it was very helpful as well.",1055894400,,397,4.410958904109589
1847188,5,B00008H2HE,I saw the video as a must have in US magazine and thought that I would try it.  Now I understand why Catherine Zeta Jones likes the videos.  My 6 month old loves watching the DVD.  I just ordered the Farmer title because we watch this one so much.  The free CD of classical music is great and my daughter and I listen to it in the car.  It is very soothing and helps her sleep.  I would definately recommend this video to anyone with a new baby.,1055894400,,445,4.0

7984148,5,B00008H2HE,"Based on a ""Land, Sea, Space"" theme, this is a wonderful DVD with footage of wild animals, fish and astronauts, etc. interspersed with ""animation"" shots of the corresponding toy animals/space ships, etc.  All of it is set to classical music which my daughter absolutely loves!  I highly recommend this DVD and the related Baby Superstar DVDs.  They're more entertaining than the Baby Einstein DVDs for my daughter.",1160956800,,414,5.149253731343284
7984149,2,B00008H2HE,"I bought this video thinking my son would like it as much as he likes Baby Bach and Baby Mozart (which he's been watching avidly since he was 2 monthes old). I popped it in and he could have cared less. He's watch Baby Mozart for two hours if I'd let him, but this video couldn't hold his attention for two minutes.
He first watched it at 5 monthes, so I though perhaps it was his age, but I pulled it out at 7 and 9 monthes and again, he could care less.",1073952000,,455,3.903225806451613
7984150,5,B00008H2HE,My baby loves it.  Just seeing him focused on the TV with his big blue eyes is a beautiful sight.  The Dvd works like a babysitter when we need 30 minutes alone and get stuff done around the house.  Every parent knows how important that 30 minute break is and this Dvd definitely gives us that.,1059523200,3,294,4.214285714285714
7984151,5,B00008H2HE,"I think the space exploration piece towards the end of the dvd is a really smart way to get a childs young mind to begin growing and learning at such a young age.  The video covers the different animals on land, in the water, in the air, and then finishes with the solar system and space exploration.  The explorer dvd is very well thought out, and I would refer any parent to the explorer video and the other baby superstar videos if they're looking for something fun and educational for a young one.",1059350400,,501,4.376344086021505
7984152,5,B00008H2HE,"My son is absolutely in love with this video.  My brother brought over his baby, both him and my son could not stop watching it.  It's amazing!",1059350400,2,143,4.2592592592592595
7984153,5,B00008H2HE,"I just recently got the Exlporer Dvd and It's great.  I own the other two Dvd's (Farmer and Forest Ranger) and they make a good set.  Now my daughter gets to choose which one she wants to watch, or at least i like to think she's choosing.  These videos are good.",1059004800,,262,4.098039215686274
7984154,1,B00008H2HE,"I don't know what the other people writing these complimentary reviews are thinking.  These videos are AWFUL.  They are shoddy, cheap, and insulting to children.  Even worse is the parents' guide on the DVDs.  It is condescending and phony.  My kids have no interest in the video.  I showed it to the other parents in my parenting group, and they all agreed with my assessment.  Maybe a very listless, slow child would like this video, but for normal, and especially above-average children, it is truly awful.",1058227200,,509,4.848837209302325
7984155,5,B00008H2HE,"Hello all, Ive been a mom twice before so I know what its like to try and find the right things for your toddler.  I am now on my third child, Christopher, who is 5 months old.  What Ive learned from my previous two kids is that they are all different.  As much as my friends tell me, or what the experts tell me, a parent is the one who knows their child the best.  My 5 month old enjoys watching the Explorer video very much. So if your child enjoys animals and the outdoors then these Baby Superstar videos will definitely be a good investment.",1057708800,2,547,4.132075471698113
