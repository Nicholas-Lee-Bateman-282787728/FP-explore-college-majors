I believe this is Southlan Films first major release and shows the quality most independent film enthusiast love to see. I felt there where plenty of scares and ahhhhhs in the movie. Although others may express they opinion otherwise, I feel this is a great movie and recommend it to anyone. Great job Southlan Films and can't wait to see what you have in store with your next movie.",1127174400,5,460,4.488095238095238
2371154,2,B000A6T1PY,"Well I can't say I love this film but I refuse to say I hate it it because I don't. It has some really good death scenes. The acting is fair, but it is an enjoyable film, and fun to watch. I am a huge Indie horror fan and I can tell by these Amazon reviews who are indie fans and who are mainstream horror nerds. For you main streamers, open up your mind.

2371156,3,B000A6T1PY,This was a very clever endeavor in fimmaking. I am a student of film and this is a cool independent horror film. After reading the other reviews here on Amazon I can only say that I enjoyed it and that is all that matters to me.  I abhore those small minded people who trash other people's good work. Just watch the film and judge for yourself. It's a fun thrill ride.,1127174400,4,368,4.183098591549296
2371157,4,B000A6T1PY,"I completely agree with those of you who enjoyed this film. It literally gave me the willies. I did think the two guys in the beginning in the truck were funny but that was all that was funny about this movie. Everything else was scary, scary, scary. I know I screamed at least 6 times, and I almost had to turn it off after the truck incident, that was over the top. I was not expecting it. I will be buying this for myself on Amazon. Lions Gate films are always the scariest, and this is no exception.",1127174400,3,503,4.142857142857143

FUNNY HOW THE GOOD REVIEWS ARE ALL COMING FROM CALIFORINA ON THE SAME DAY HMMMMMM!!! AS FOR HOW I GOT THE MOVIE BEFORE IT CAME OUT, I TOO HAVE A FRIEND AT BB, THAT'S HOW I KNOW IT SUCKS BIG TIME, AHEAD OF TIME, THANK YOU. LAST TIME I CHECKED THIS IS A FREE COUNTRY IF I THOUGHT THE MOVIE SUCKED I AM ALOWED TO SAY SO, JUST LIKE YOUR ALOWED TO SAY HOW GOOD THIS MOVIE IS. NOW WHO'S BEING SMALL MINDED.

2371159,4,B000A6T1PY,"My girlfriend brought a screener home last night from BB video where she works and we watched it together. She would not let me go the whole movie. That's what I'm talking about. I got on Amazon today to order it and decided to comment. I lost count as to how many get the axe after about 12. There is one scene that is especially wicked involving a girl jogging and a guy driving a truck, that's all I'm gonna say because I do not wanna ruin it for you. I'm kind of disappointed that the monster on the cover looks different from the one in the movie but the one in the film looks better so that's okay. Me and Melissa give it 2 thumbs up. If you did not like this movie, then go get your head examined and get over it!",1127174400,2,720,4.006944444444445
2371160,3,B000A6T1PY,"Finally another scary movie set during Halloween, and of course it was put out by Lions gate. I had the pleasure of renting it and watching it on my off day today after reading about it here on Amazon. I was pretty happy with the movie except for the Reverend character. The bad Guy Poley was funny, and the monster was neat. I jumped a few times, and was impressed by the venge murders. It is for sure a B movie but it is a good one. I bought jack O a few years back and that was okay too, but I like this one better.",1127174400,5,518,3.8962264150943398
2371161,3,B000A6T1PY,"I rented Jack O lantern today and found it to be a relly creative film with lots of scary scenes, and some very shocking killing scenes. I would not recommend this for kids, as the killing scenes are pretty graphic, one in particular. The acting is pretty good, and the music is great. The effects are really cool and the monster is different from anything I've ever seen. I figured he would be some scarecrow, but he is actually pretty cool looking. Be aware though that this is not a big budget horror film it is obviously an indie horror flick, but those are my favorites. I have seen some really bad Indie horror films in the past couple of years, but I was quite happy with this one. I guess I will buy it one day when the price comes down and add it to my hundreds of other horror DVD's.

2371162,3,B000A6T1PY,"I went out this morning and rented Jack O Lantern. I just happened to see a review here on Amazon written on the 14th and was wondering how this person could write a review on a film that was not released until today. I know it was not available for viewing on line.  Probably some disgruntled actor or filmmaker. Anyhow, here is an unbiased take on this creepy little film. I was hesitant to rent it at first because I thought it might be another sucky indie horror film but it had the Lions Gate tag on it so I took the chance and was pleasantly surprised. In fact the acting was quite good and the death scenes rocked, I was especially freaked out by the truck scene. How someone could find this film boring is beyond me because it was anything but boring. 5 or 6 people bite the dust  in the first 5 minutes. WOW! That was a surprise. The lead actor who played Jack pulled it off quite nicely and really brought the character to life. By no means is this a million dollar movie but then neither was Halloween. I really enjoyed this film and I plan on adding it to my collection, I thought it was well shot, well directed, and I loved the score. Want to jump out of your seat, then watch Jack O Lantern. Sure to become a cult favorite.",1127174400,8,1238,4.197478991596639
2371213,1,B000A6T1PY,"I had marginal hopes for this one.  It looked like it would have the classic horror elements but with a slightly new spin.  A few minutes into the movie I realized I was wrong.

""What went wrong?"", you ask.  Well, to start with the prologue deals with some guys being pursued by cannibalistic rednecks.  This has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, or if it does it was during one of the moments towards the end where I began to doze off.  Sad thing is I was wide awake before I started watching.

The main plot deals with your basic 26 year old ""teenager"", named Jack, who has been left seemingly brain damaged after a car accident that also took the life of his father.  The guilty parties start getting killed off by a monster with a pumpkin head(though not ""Pumpkinhead"", that movie was pretty good).  After each killing, Jack seems to become more normal.

Although the plotline's derivative, this still could have been a decent movie.  Any chances of that happening are foiled by the hack writing, bad acting, and amateurish direction.  Not to mention the leaden pacing.  The movie's boring, bottom line.

The DVD contains a ""making of"" featurette that's much better than the film itself.  The filmmakers and actors are enthusiastic about the film in the featurette which leads me to believe none of them had seen the finished product before they were interviewed.

Ladies and gentlemen, this is one to avoid.",1147651200,3,1420,4.665322580645161
2371214,1,B000A6T1PY,"The clear winner, absolutely the worst horror movie I have ever seen. So that makes the fact that Amazon is ordering more REALLY scary, and look at the other link. . you can add this to a wedding registry. (gee guys, I'd sure love that ""Jack O Lantern"" movie for my own collection, forget the bottles of wine or the trip to Cancun)

The cover art and trailer looked promising.. . the tag line  .
""One year after a deadly car accident, Jack returns home and tries to get past the recurring nightmares that haunt him. As his deadly visions become a reality, Jack soon realizes that each new nightmare is uncovering details of the accident that he had forgotten and someone is using him to
exact a deadly vengeance""

This is a HOME MOVIE! Seriously, it looks to be shot on a Best Buy camcorder  with actors rounded up from the nearest McDonalds.

It opens with the words ""Halloween"" on the screen while the three boys running out of gas in the boonies are clearly being filmed in what was the middle of summer, as far as vegetation, lighting and the chorus of cicadas as the sun went down.

The first part of the movie had absolutely no semblance to the plot tag. These three young people, the sterotypical good guy, black guy, and overweight fun guy, break down after leaving the main roadway onto dirt roads in search of a gas station. It morphs into a deliverance type plot with a slow witted inbred with an ""ax to grind"", his face hidden by a hat (run for your lives it's Wilson from Home Improvement!)

The next scene where some blond on the run from the monster runs into the boys is such a monument to bad acting, it is almost worth the rental just to watch that scene alone. ""Wilson"" is soon done in by the real movie monster. . which after seeing, all I can say is bwah ha ha ha hahahahahahahahahahaa. The Petco dog sock puppet would have been scarier.

The film itself has no semblance of a cohesive plot, with
completely unexplainable and random threads tossed in with wild abandon. After the seemingly unrelated opening we get to a bit about a car accident and another sterotype is added, this time the religious figure who has to be the worst actor ever fill the screen.

The movie ends abruptly, never pulling any of the plot pieces together, and ending seemingly only for the reason that the sun came up, but not before they could throw in a lame brained ""maybe there will be a sequel"" scene that defies credulity.",1140652800,6,2426,4.445945945945946
2371215,1,B000A6T1PY,"Don't worry, there's nothing I can spoil for you in this review. This pumpkin is already spoiled and rotten beyond belief.

A bunch of kids are drunk and then kill somebody on the road. Years later, there's a stalker going around with a pumpkin on his head killing all the kids that were involved. It's like I Know What You Did Last Summer with a pumpkin man. This shoddy production is shot on somebody's home video camera with a bunch of actors who have been recruited from the local shopping mall. It's not really worth spending any more time on it. It's a waste of time for me to write, and a waste of time for you to read. Go ahead and pass this one by, trick or treaters, this movie is like the stale candy that somebody had left over from three years ago.",1138320000,,761,4.248275862068965
2371216,1,B000A6T1PY,"The DVD cover fooled me.  It looked like a stylish horror film with a storyline like MEMENTO or THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT.

NOT!

This is a HOME MOVIE!  Seriously, it looks to be shot on a consumer camcorder, with the usual flat lighting.  The sound isn't that great either.

The acting ranges from barely acceptible to really bad.  I wonder if anyone from this cast of unknowns had any training?  They pause between lines (non-actors can get self-conscious before a camera), or chew the scenary, or talk with their hands.

The script is full of banal chatter and overlong shots.  Lots of ""Hey there, how's it going?""  ""Pretty good.""  ""All right.  I'll be seeing you.""  ""Okay then.""

I realize that much effort goes into even a home movie, but it's unfair to sell such amateaurish nonsense as a professional film.  Hell, it's a ripoff.

It's not enough to put in the effort of a shoot.  CAST TRAINED ACTORS!  I realize this film was shot in suburban Georgia (which for some unexplained reason, locates its story in suburban North Carolina), but please make the effort to drive to Atlanta, where I'm sure there's trained SAG actors.

And LEARN SCRIPTWRITING.  Even beginner students should be able to avoid pointless padding and banal chit-chat.

The story, as far as it goes, borrows from PUMPKINHEAD.  A pumpkin-headed monster takes revenge on some college kids who were responsible for killing a man in a traffic accident.  The monster makeup isn't that bad.  But the writing and acting and videography are amateurish.",1136505600,6,1515,4.847058823529411
2371217,2,B000A6T1PY,"Ugh. This movie is bad! After seeing the trailer, I was so excited to see it. The trailer is AWESOME! That is the only good thing about this. First of all, some of it was done with hand-held cameras, which is not necessarily bad. The sound effects are terrible. The acting stinks, as usual. This movie doesn't have much to do with a car accident, like the back says. The guy who plays Jack is cute, but slow. I got this at Hollywood Video, it was in the ""3 for $30"" section, now I know why.",1129852800,,490,4.114583333333333
2371218,1,B000A6T1PY,"Well, kids, if you want to see a terrific, scary movie,ah...put this one back on the shelf! Jumpy, nonsensical plot, terrible acting (these guys would get an F in high school drama class), raunchy second-rate effects and a laughable monster that looks like a costumer from a school play was called in to do the job after someone left a cheap pumpkin mask in the hot car too long and it partially melted, makes for an all-round piece of rubbish. The best thing about this whole movie is the box art--sit and stare at it and maybe you can make up a plot and characters in your imagination that would be scarier than this waste of time. Insomniacs, take note! This video just may be your cure without resorting to those habit-forming drugs! Seriously, this film is a royal dud, consider yourself warned!",1128297600,2,800,4.601398601398602
2371219,4,B000A6T1PY,"This movie does what all good horror movies/books do: It puts us into a reality we can all quickly identify with and slowly pulls us down into darkness and horror.

Tragedy strikes fast, but nothing that would seem unrealistic. Then slowly the element of fiction is added to the mix. Hints are given that something is wrong (bleeding pumpkin, the constant nightmares...) yet this movie is so well contructed that it leaves the viewer guessing until the very end (is this supernatural or a psycho killer? Is one of the friends doing the killings, they are almost never fully assembled in the same scenes...?).

Characters are very easy to like and hate, especially Jack (main character)  seems to constantly walk on thin ice with his very sanity ( what he has left anyways) at stake.

Good movie all the way through except for the forest-running scenes (it just doesn't look that good) and the scene where the two girls sleep at the house and one freaks out before going to sleep is a little bit execively dramatic (also people don't panic and fall asleep, the state of shock that normally causes insomia)

Good job to whoever directed this one

2371220,3,B000A6T1PY,"this movie will keep you somewhat entertained, but it goes from one extreme to the other.  There is some excellent editing for the horror genre, but then there is general editing that is just awful. There is some gore and some well-crafted chilling visuals, but you will never jump out of your seat. Acting is mostly not very good.

As for the plot, it's basically I Know What You Did Last Summer meets Jack-O (anyone remember that film?). The ""killer"" is a somewhat creepier looking version of Jack-O. The real problem lies in the lack of explanation for anything that is happening. The reasons for the killings is explained at the end--but not who Jack O Lantern is or why he manifests himself. You're sort of left to draw your own conclusions. And the way he is destroyed at the end is really anti-climactic. Also, there's an intro to the movie that is really detached from the rest of the film, and doesn't connect at all.

Honestly, there's no predicting whether you will like this movie or not. At this price, I definitely suggest you rent it first to decide if it's worthy of your horror collection.",1127174400,6,1106,4.604060913705584

The movie started bad and ended bad and you know you have stretched beyound anyones reason when the fat man gets a weapon out of his truck that happens to be a machine gun LMAO.It was at that moment that it could have gone camp and been a B classic but they went the way of bad cut gore scenes. Heck even when the girl is running through the woods she has a cheap video camera spotlight on her. I bursted out laughing on that one. And her country twang was so over the top it was insulting.

 If you want to make a good B movie at least make it entertaining. This one was not. I give a B for the cover art,but an F for the movie. His candle was blown out long before his first kill.",1127174400,,831,3.8823529411764706

The film opens with three good old boys in a pickup truck on Halloween evening in Mississippi.  They encounter a couple of rednecks who are obviously cannibals, and also a screaming blonde who says these guys killed a bunch of her friends, and of course, the three good old boys get it too, but so do the killers by some unseen force.

Flash forward to a year and lo and behold, this whole setup has nothing to do with the rest of this lamely made fiasco.  A teenage boy who looks all of 27 is mute as a result of an auto accident which killed his father.  Soon some jackolanterned killer starts wiping out his friends, and is it this lamebrained kid named Jack or what?  Forcing a totally unconvincing reason for these revenge killings does little to validate the plot.  The acting in this movie is awful; they even have one scene where they switched victims because one of the actresses (used loosely) wasn't available to finish the movie, so they just switched who got killed...but they don't show the audience who gets killed.

8075244,2,B000A6T1PY,"Just a quick side-note. I love bad horror films. I love cheesy-bad horror films. And one of the best parts about seeing a bad film is coming here to Amazon to read the reviews. I got a good laugh out of a couple of the reviews posted here....the fact that you can add the ""Jack O'Lantern"" DVD to your wedding registry is GREAT! I never would have noticed that if it weren't pointed out in a review! I want to get divorced and remarried just so I can register a ton of crappy movies for me and my future wife!

Okay onto the movie. Maybe it's just me, but I enjoyed this film. Sure it's grade Z stuff, with bad acting, goofy special effects, and has the production values of your standard home movies, but I enjoyed it. Of course I only paid $1.99 for it at Blockbuster, so I felt I got my money's worth. And while the story is hardly original, ""Wrong Turn"" meets ""Pumpkinhead"" meets ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", it was kind of fun. It's nonsense, but it's fun nonsense. Like how ""Jack"" chases several victims around the Georgian suburbs in broad daylight, but we later learn, sunlight may be Jack's Achilles heel? And ""Jack"" is a pretty impressive looking monster....until he steps out of the shadows. When we finally see ""Jack"" in full lighting you can't help but chuckle. The acting is awful for sure, but I gotta say I couldn't do any better, and it's about on par with what you would expect from an indy horror flick shot in Georgia.

The ""Behind the Screams"" extra is great. Everyone is so excited and talking about ""Jack O'Lantern"" as though it's an A-List film. But it does offer a neat peak into the world of indy films. I don't think I would recommend ""Jack O'Lantern"" to anyone wanting a truly scary flick, but if you like your horror with no production values, and served with a heaping load of cheese, then you might like this movie.

And by the way, for those of you who think the is the ""worst horror movie ever!"", I defy you to sit through ""The Last Slumber Party"".",1150416000,3,1986,4.3621621621621625
