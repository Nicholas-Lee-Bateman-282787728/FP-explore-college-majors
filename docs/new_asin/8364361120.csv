1170947,4,8364361120,"Although the quality of the DVD itself is not stellar, it is far better than nothing. The story is just as dreamlike and strange as I remember. Wojciech Has's work is reminiscent of Terry Gilliam here (moreso than ""Saragossa Manuscript""). A man wanders around an old asylum that is keeping his dying father, but time acts oddly at this place. He travels from room to room entering bizarre childhood memories, recollections of history, and mixed emotions. It's a great movie that does feel its length toward the end, but the beautiful costumes, cinematography, and surreal imagery make it well worth the trip.",1311120000,,608,4.970588235294118
1170948,5,8364361120,"Other reviewers have given much more detailed analysis of this film and the history thereof, which I could not equal or do better. So here is my simple review. The film uses techniques which one could say are dreamlike but also they evoke something of an almost hallucinatory/LSD movie trip film from the late 60's or 70's. So I would say in some ways the technique is slightly dated, but it doesn't mean bad. It is a kind of grand experimental film from a bygone era. It is a stream of consciousness from a dream/drug trip with the thread it is always coming back to that the main character's father has recently died, or he has been dreamed back to life only to comment on his own death or of the trivialities of his life and times. The main character, the son, travels through this world as though he's traveling through his father's mind. Perhaps this is an influence for the film ""Being John Malkovich"", there are some similarities. At times it evokes humor, at other times it is perplexing. If you aren't at least a little versed in history, psychology and philosophy with a touch of physics you might become somewhat lost and frustrated. It can be a bit of a roller coaster ride with very little explanation and for the average viewer some of the explanations that are given might at times seem opaque, but like looking at a great painting, if you can look deeper into the context and into yourself you might find a personal meaning for you that was not necessarily intended by the director. This is the definition of great art. Everyone who looks at it finds their own meaning in it. Its beauty, or ugliness is in the eye of the beholder. You may love it, hate it, or be perplexed by it, but you think about it and talk about it.  The book this is based on may be a classic of literature, but I am reviewing the movie, not the book. No movie will ever be ""Just like the book"". They have to be separated, they are two different art forms. Nothing can equal the movie you can make in your mind while reading a book. A screenwriter and a director do their interpretation and translate it into their vision in a different medium. To compare the two just isn't fair to either of them. A movie has to be evaluated on its own terms.",1305417600,5,2233,4.393719806763285
1170949,3,8364361120,"""The Santorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass"" is an unusual and extremely well written short story by Bruno Schulz, a Jewish Polish writer of the 1930's who was killed by the Nazi's. His writing can be compared to Kafka, or Marquez (100 Years of Solitude particularly). Has, the director of The Hourglass Sanatorium (1973) meant it as a tribute to Schulz whom he had read when growing up. But he mixes up the Sanatorium  with some of Schulz's other stories and with some of his own political views. Due to the latter, it had to be smuggled out of Communist Poland to the Cannes Film Festival. I was curious to see what he would do with the story. And the visualization of the Sanatorium in ruins was quite effective, but I was disappointed with the film as a whole. Maybe viewers more 'into' surrealistic films will enjoy it more.",1300492800,3,832,4.546666666666667
1170950,5,8364361120,"After waiting over 2 decades for some kind of video release of ""Hour-glass Sanatorium"" (or ""The Sandglass"" as it used to be called), Mr. Bongo in England has put out a passable transfer of this astonishing creation.  If you've never seen or heard about this one, you're in for an overwhelming experience.  Probably the most authentically ""dreamlike"" feature film ever made, the complex web of events here is impossible to summarize in a rational plot description.  Though its evocation of a Jewish culture completely wiped out from Poland during WW2 is reason alone to watch, it really is about loss and the evanescence of life, memory and imagination. The DVD transfer is fair but is presented in 1.85:1 rather than in its original scope format (2.35:1).  Because of this, characters often appear too near the edges of the frame and background detail is sometimes lost.  The frequently awkward subtitles are not as good as the translations in the theatrical prints I've seen.  Still, since this film is easily one of the masterpieces of cinema, at least now it can be seen by a wide audience.",1228953600,11,1093,4.881081081081081

7901013,4,8364361120,"Don't be deterred by anyone dismissing 'Hourglass Sanatorium' as a disjointed exercise in excess.  Yes, it demands patience and a willingness to find its wave-length among its visual and thematic vicissitudes.  However this is a puzzle box of a film that trusts us to draw upon our own perceptions, biases, educations and politics to decipher its wonders.  Yet there's nothing random here -- each sequence, transition and contextual reference to ethnic and class struggles is precisely plotted.  Director W. Has immerses us in a dream-state/nightmare, wandering a dolorous landscape that few filmmakers are able to accomplish (think of Altman's ""3 Women"" and ""Fellini Satyricon"".)  Each set-up, choice of lens and angle drives us on towards Has' parallax view of socio-political mania.  In the end it commits the sin of running 15 minutes longer than required to create its impact and it will most likely vex the majority of contemporary audiences, who demand a pre-fab plot-line.  Still if one can find its rhythm and measure, they're in for an unforgettable ""nachtmare"".

7901014,1,8364361120,"...and you can get away with filming any tripe. I don't buy the thesis that this mess of a film is profound simply by virtue of being labyrinthine. Whilst a degree of disjointedness is to be expected in a narrative concerned with dream-states, the originally intriguing premise of 'The Hourglass Sanatorium' is squandered in a self-indulgent meander through one man's inability to hold or write a script (although his onanistic focus on breasts and religious/racial stereotypes is firmly held). Why, for instance, does the protagonist find himself in the position of the relative that he set out to visit, and why is nothing made of the great potential in the initial idea that this Institution is truly a 'special' place, as suggested by events on his arrival, rather than the more mundane possibility that the protagonist is simply mad and the whole film is an introspection on his condition? In this latter regard, the film has one small merit -- that is, I can't really think of another film that made me think more what it must be like to be relieved of one's sanity and not know what is real and what is not, but the last five moderately compelling minutes of this film do not excuse the two hours of silly, Carrollesque noodling that precede it. One to watch once perhaps, but hardly one for the repeated viewing that video affords. The aesthetes will doubtless gag, but I'll be happy never to see this again.",1447113600,,1416,4.7368421052631575

7901017,1,8364361120,"I don't know if the film's good or not because I didn't get to watch it.  It didn't play in my DVD player.  The Amazon product description states that the disc is for US and Canada, but it's in PAL format, which is evidently a European format.  I had to send the disc back.  I advised Amazon of this discrepancy, they thanked me for my input, but they haven't changed the product description.  Perhaps some of the discs are suitable for US players, because so many reviewers here appear to have had no problems viewing it, but at least one other reviewer has noted this is in PAL format, intended for UK players.",1410652800,5,612,4.380530973451328
7901018,5,8364361120,"I am glad this finally got restored. I enjoy reading Bruno Schulz. Schulz is a really underrated writer and deserves a wider audience. I hope this issue will introduce him to more readers. Back to the movie, Like the Saragossa Manuscript (Has's other effort) it is full of twists and turns that ought to delight audiences. Originally I ordered the BluRay version, but had some playback problems, the DVD worked flawlessly.",1408665600,,422,4.957746478873239
7901019,4,8364361120,"This review is for the Blu Ray produced by Zebra(?) that has ""Rekonstrukja"" at top.  This is a region-free blu ray which is at what I assume to be the correct ratio.  At the time of this review the price asked here is better than when I ordered it direct.

The other reviews have summarized the ""plot,"" as it is, in which a young man visits his father in the Sanatorium, where time is ""relative,"" as the doctor tells him.  By visiting his father he relives part of his life growing up in a Jewish ghetto, and the very end seems to indicate the Holocaust that is yet to come.  But ... forget the plot!  If you have ever thought Spanish films or French films cornered the market on surrealism, this is a candy-colored, gorgeously filmed trip through madness and life.  I first saw this in a DVD version that was dark, faded, and had a rather poor English translation compared to this one (IIRC).  I was bored and slept through part of it.  This blu ray is astounding -- colors are bold and bright, the cinematography is astronomical, and even though many times the most exciting thing you see are piles of junk or old doors, the sharpness of the filming is made clear in this version and it is a movie made one hundred times more interesting for it.",1397779200,2,1247,4.363636363636363
