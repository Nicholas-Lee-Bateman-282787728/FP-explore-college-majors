2473616,5,B000CSUNLQ,"It amazes me how some people feel the need to comment on how the evil DVD companies are gouging us by releasing more Star Trek.

Here's a clue: If you already have these episodes, then you don't have to buy these theme collections.

However, if you are like me and many others here who do not own all the season sets from all of the different series, these collections are a great way to own some of the best episodes of several of the different series without laying out hundreds of dollars. There is a definite market for these sets: it's called the casual viewer - someone who liked the various incarnations of Trek, and said ""gee, I wish I could own all the borg episodes"" (or similar).

I bought the Borg set, and I bought this Time Travel one today. I will also buy the Q set when it comes out. Does that mean I'll buy everything they release (Worf sets, Data sets)? Probably not, but I'll certainly not begrudge anyone who *does* want to buy them.

It's called ""choice"", and it's a good thing.",1144108800,18,1000,4.360215053763441
2473617,4,B000CSUNLQ,"I'm really only answering this in response to the person that asked ""why?"" and gave these collections 1 star. I'm a Star Trek fan, but I'm not rich, and in all honesty I'm not a big enough fan to by the 20+ season collections at $100 or more each to get the few episodes I would watch over and over.  These sets are a fantastic alternative and so far the two themes I've seen (Borg and Time Travel) are excellent.  I will be buying this one today, and bought the Borg collection the day it came out.  Thanks again Paramount for finding a cheaper alternative for those of us who can't afford or don't want every episode of every season of Star Trek.",1144108800,11,648,4.252032520325203
2473618,1,B000CSUNLQ,"I'll preface this by saying that my one-star review is not for the content, but for the idea of the set. With the exception of ""Time's Arrow 1 and 2,"" most of these episodes are ones I'd rate from ""good"" to ""exceptional.""

I'll echo the others here and say, ""Why, Paramount?"" I just don't get the reason behind these fan-collective sets. Like a lot of Trek fans, I have all of the episodes on DVD already so, special packaging or not, these sets hold no attraction for me.

If Paramout would like to release some REALLY interesting Trek DVDs, they should release the Animated Series. I'd buy that in a second.

With Costco now selling TNG and DS9 seasons for $45 each, there's little reason to invest in this.",1144022400,2,709,4.48062015503876
2473619,1,B000CSUNLQ,"Ok, I understand everyone's opinion about how great this is for someone who doesn't own (or can't afford) the seasons, and I agree. However, for people like me who do own all 28 seasons, 10 ""Special Edition"" movies (that I have already bought twice because I also owned the single disc versions that they released first), this would be an absolute waste of money. In my opinion, Paramount is simply trying to make up for the shortsightedness of canceling Enterprise.

Sure, the first season of ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" was a slow start and the second season (although better), wasn't much to write home about. The third and forth seasons were not only much better but more along the lines of what true ""Star Trek"" is all about. It showed us history and explanations for things in the Star Trek universe that had never been explained before. Now, I'm sure that because of the serialized nature of the last 2 seasons, the ratings may have fell a little because not everyone owns a DVR and once you miss an episode, and you're lost. Big deal! You can't tell me they didn't sell enough DVD sets to make up for the ratings.

Now, for the first time in years, there is no new Star Trek, and no new income. Not only for Paramount but also probably a lot of the behind the scenes staff as well. In the meantime they are releasing these ""collectives"" in hopes that the die hard fans, like myself, will buy them, because I think I have to own it all. Well not this time! Like I said above, I have already bought the movies twice because they didn't put any specials on the first set. I'm not about to spend money on the same episodes I already own, not to mention the fact that there are episodes that appear on more than one of these ""collectives"".

If Paramount wants to continue the ""Star Trek"" revenue, they should release new material. Unlike a lot of people, I enjoyed ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" and would love to see movies released about Voyager's return to earth, or what happened to Deep Space Nine's people after the war was over, or anything else NEW that Paramount could come up with. Hey, here's an idea, how about we finish some (if not all), of the 6-year gap we left at the end of ""Enterprise"". Come on, Paramount, get it together!",1143849600,4,2231,4.476658476658477
2473620,2,B000CSUNLQ,"Assuming the duplicates accurately reflect which episodes the fans rated highest in each category, then what we have here is a perfect example of ""the tyranny of the masses"".  The fatal flaw with pure democracy is that, sometimes, the majority is just wrong.

If it wasn't for the exclusion of ""Assignment: Earth"" I'd buy the time travel set!",1143849600,2,342,4.879310344827586
2473621,5,B000CSUNLQ,"True ""Star Trek"" fans are going collect complete seasons on DVD.  Consequently, thematic sets like ""Star Trek Fan Collective: Time Travel"" appeal to less rabid fans who might be attracted if more than half of these episode are ones they would like to own.  The collection is solid, but you might already have the best of what is here:

""Star Trek"" Episode 21, ""Tomorrow Is Yesterday"" finds the ""Enterprise"" going back in time, courtesy of the gravitational pull of a black hole, to the 1960s.  Kirk rescues an Air Force pilot, Captain John Christopher, he cannot let return with his knowledge of the future.  But Christopher has to return to have a son who will be a famous space explorer (Warp 4).

""Star Trek"" Episode 28, ""The City on the Edge of Forever"" is the most famous ""Star Trek"" episode.  McCoy goes back in time through the Guardian of Forever and changes history. Kirk and Spock follow to set things right, ending up in the U.S. during the Great Depression.  The focal point is Edith Keeler, a social worker.  McCoy saved her life and Edith led a peace movement that delayed U.S. involvement in World War II, allowing Hitler to create atomic weapons first and win the war. Kirk is in love with Edith, but she must die (Warp 5).

""STNG"" Episode 63, ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" is the ""Enterprise-C,"" which comes through a temporal rift and changes everything changes. The ""Enterprise-D"" is now a ship of war, fighting a losing war with the Klingon Empire, so Worf is gone and Tasha Yar is back. Guinan knows something is wrong and has to convince Picard that the correct timeline must be restored no matter what (Warp 5).

""STNG"" Episode 118, ""Cause and Effect"" finds the ""Enterprise"" trapped in a time loop ending with the starship exploding. This pattern is repeated several times, but each progression changes, offering clues for avoiding the ship's apparent fate. These changes are most notable in the poker game being played by several members of the bridge crew (Warp 5).

""STNG"" Episodes 126 & 127, ""Time's Arrow, Parts 1 & 2"" find the ""Enterprise"" has returned to Earth where Captain Picard is shown an archeological dig in San Francisco that has uncovered Data's head among a bunch of late 19th-Century artifacts.  Investigating a temporal distortion on Devidia Two, Data is caught in a rift and sent back to 19th-Century Earth.  There he discovers Guinan in the company of Samuel Clemens.  Back in the future, Guinan tells Picard it is very important that he go on this away mission.  The funniest parts here are the attempts by Data to fit into the past.  There is an explanation for why his head was buried for 500 years, but these episodes are only slightly above average (Warp 4).

""STNG"" Episodes 177 & 178, ""All Good Things, Parts 1 & 2"" finds Captain Picard is shifting through time. One moment he is twenty-five years in the future, a retired ambassador tending his vineyard but suffering from a degenerative neurological disease. Then he finds himself seven years in the past when he first took over the ""Enterprise.""  In the present the ship is sent to the Neutral Zone to investigate an anomaly that has appeared. Picard finally realizes who is responsible for his time shifting and finds himself once again in the courtroom Q created to try humanity in ""Encounter at Farpoint."" The trial never officially ended and the Continuum has finally reached a verdict. The human race should be destroyed, but the Q do not have to do anything for this to happen. The anomaly is going back in time, growing larger as it does, until it will arrive at Earth at the pivotal moment when life is created. Now there never be life on Earth and Picard will be the one who caused it.  A very satisfying conclusion to the seven-year run of the series (Warp 5).

""Deep Space Nine"" Episode 80, ""Little Green Men"" begins with Quark transporting Nog to Earth so the young Ferengi can be the first of his kind to enter Starfleet Academy. The next thing we know the shuttle has crashed near Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. The military takes the trio into custody.  Quark immediately starts scheming to make a profit, but the government wants to torture Quark to find out about the alien invasion (Warp 4.5)

""Deep Space Nine"" Episode 103, ""Trials and Tribble-ations"" has the Bajoran Orb of Time being used to send the ""Defiant"" and its crew back over a hundred years to Deep Space Station K-7 where the U.S.S. ""Enterprise,"" Captain James T. Kirk, commanding, is in orbit.  Suddenly we find ourselves in the classic original ""Star Trek"" episode, ""The Trouble With Tribbles"" (Warp 5).

""Voyager"" Episodes 76 & 77, ""Year of Hell, Parts 1 and 2"" begins when the starship is attacked by the Krenim with the Chronoton-based torpedoes.  Seven of Nine works out shielding against the torpedoes, and the next time they are attacked the space-time continuum is changed.  The Krenim commander, Annorax, tries to erase ""Voyager"" from history, but the badly damaged ship escapes.  Keeping the command crew aboard, Janeway orders the rest to abandon ship.  Meanwhile, Janeway must repair ""Voyager"" and put together a coalition to try and stop Annorax, who is changing the present to correct a past mistake (Warp 5).

""Voyager"" Episodes 171 & 172, ""Endgame, Parts 1 & 2"" is the series finale.  Admiral Janeway, ten years after getting her crew back, travels back in time to convince her younger self to take a desperate shortcut through a wormhole controlled by the Borg.  Janeway and her crew, still committed to the idea of putting the needs of others before themselves that got them stuck in the Delta quadrant in the first place, refuse.  But then the Admiral reveals the high cost that her younger self will have to pay, and suggests a new plan that will allow ""Voyager"" to accomplish both tasks (Warp 5).",1143072000,31,5796,4.764
2473622,4,B000CSUNLQ,"Given how many Star Trek episodes have time-related themes to them, this has to be the most difficult fan collection to be assembled of the three (Borg and Q being the others).  The episodes in this collection are enjoyable, some very much so, but I do have issue with the inclusion of All Good Things . . . and Endgame.  These two episodes are also on the other afore mentioned fan collections.  In place of these, I would chose DS9's The Visitor and VOY's Timeless.  Timeless is probably my favorite Voyager episode and I cannot believe it didn't get enough votes to be included!  Nevertheless, as I say it is hard to pick from so many episodes.  Buy this collection for the commentaries if for nothing else and enjoy!",1142121600,4,720,4.542635658914729
2473623,4,B000CSUNLQ,"This is a pretty good collection if you have specific episodes of the various ""Trek"" incarnations that you want. The theme is pretty obvious here and in the title of the set--time travel. This set gathers the best episodes (as voted for by fans online) of the various incarnations of Trek (except for ""Enterprise""). ""The Original Series"" has two of the strongest episodes involving time travel. These were put together after input from an online poll by Trek fans. They use the same transfers as before of the episodes from the previously released boxed sets.

The Original Series has two of its finest episodes included; ""The City on the Edge of Forever"" and ""Tomorrow is Yesterday"". In the former Dr. McCoy uses a time portal to change the past on Earth and allow Germany to win WWII. Kirk and McCoy must make things right or their world won't exist. ""City on the Edge of Forever"" won a Writer's Guild Award for Harlan Ellison's original script and a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation for the episode. In ""Tomorrow is Yesterday"" the Enterprise is thrown back in time to the 1960's from a slingshot effect. They are spotted, photographed and recorded by the US military. In order to prevent contamination of the timeline Kirk and Spock must remove the evidence but, in the process, create more evidence of their presence. Combining action, suspense and whimsy is no small feat and D.C. Fontana's terrific script does all of these very well indeed.

""The Next Generation"" checks in with a number of terrific episodes. The best of the lot is ""Yesterday's Enterprise"". Picard and his crew encounter an Enterprise from 22 years ago when it passes through a rift in space/time. When the ship comes through it changes the present so that Picard and the Federation are at war with the Klingons. Somehow by passing through the present has been changed. Only Guinan notices that the present isn't what it is supposed to be. She tells Picard about her concerns. Now Picard must send the Enterprise C and her crew back through the rift to insure that the war with the Klingons never happens but doing so condemns the crew of the ""C"" to certain death.

The 2 part ""All Good Things"" wraps up the ""Next Generation"" TV show. Picard discovers that the universe is going to end and it's all his fault! Q provides clues but no answers as to how Picard and his crew have somehow doomed the Universe to be destroyed. Picard literally becomes unstuck in time drifting backwards and forwards to different times in his career with Star Fleet including his first mission on the Enterprise, the discovery of a tear in the fabric of the universe and in the future where he has convinced Captain Beverly Crusher to take him on one final mission. The well written script by Ronald D.Moore (""Battlestar: Galatica"")Brannon Braga borrows from Kurt Vonnegut's classic novel SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE in setting up its central premise of Picard moving randomly through time. Incorporating elements of the two hour pilot episode it insured that ""The Next Generation"" went out on a high note.

The Deep Space Nine set of episodes are both terrific ones but it is missing a great episode ""The Visitor"" where Sisko drifts through time and the only one that can save him is Jake who as an adult has been waiting for his father to show up in their future. ""The Visitor"" was nominated for a Hugo Award for best Dramatic Presentation and is an emotionally charged episode. ""Trials and Tribulations"" features Cisco and his crew are sent 100 years into the past to hunt for a dangerous Klingon spy. They interact with the Enterprise and their crew from the episode ""The Trouble with Tribbles"". It's a light, fun episode that works amazingly well. Produced to commenerate the 30th Anniversary of ""Star Trek"" the episode seamlessly incorporates footage from the original 1967 TV episode as well.  In ""Little Green Men"" we discover who the Roswell aliens really were--Ferengi who accidently travel to Earth's past. Quark sees profit in the past but things change quickly for these ""little green men"".

""Year of hell, Part I & II"" features the Voyager crew. Voyager discovers a short cut to take them home but it takes them through Zahl territory an area claimed by a race called the Kremin. A time ship appears altering the timeline and wiping out the Zahl. The commander of the Kremin ship Annorax (Kurtwood Smith)is attempting to undo the destruction to his people in a war with the Zahl in which the Kremin were defeated. His latest efforts haven't been successful and he discovers that Voyager was to blame. He then decides to eradciate Voyager from the timeline.

""Endgame Parts 1 & 2"" is another Voyager two-parter and it closed out the series. Admiral Janeway travels to the past to contact Voyager and give them the option of using technology from the future to shorten their trip. Unfortunately the technlogy that the Admiral has brought back has attracted the attention of the Borg who want it for their own.

While this isn't a perfect collection (it's missing at least two key episodes including ""The Visitor"" and the classic original series episode ""Assignment:Earth"" which was a pilot for another series), it's quite good cherry picking the best episodes of four of the series. It does, however, miss a key two part episode of ""Enterprise"" involving the temporal war that was extremely good. This is a solid set to get some of the best episodes produced by three of the five series produced during Trek's long run.",1141603200,79,5485,4.809119830328738

2473625,5,B000CSUNLQ,"Star Trek Time Travel Fan Collection is a four-disc boxed set spanning all of the Star Trek series, with the exception of Enterprise, and includes 12 episodes that were selected in an Internet poll compiled by Paramount of favorites then voted on by more than 200,000 fans. It is the second theme boxed set to be released involving the Star Trek franchise, the other is Fan Collection - Borg. While theme sets are not always popular, Paramount may have hit upon winners in these two collections, especially for fans who have been unwilling or unable to purchase the pricey complete season boxed sets of each series.

Disc One includes:

Tomorrow is Yesterday, ST: The Original Series, Season 1. Capt. Kirk and crew are thrown into a time warp that transports the Enterprise into the past. They find themselves orbiting the Earth in the 1960s and are spotted by U.S. radar and labeled a UFO. They end up transporting an Air Force fighter pilot captain aboard then have to figure out how to return him safely and get back to their own time without affecting the past.

The City on the Edge of Forever, ST: The Original Series, Season 1. This episode is considered by many to be one of the best, if not the best, of the entire three-year run of the series. Capt. Kirk and Spock travel back in time to a large Earth city during the Depression through an ancient Time Portal in an attempt to find Dr. McCoy, who has gone mad after accidentally self-injecting a powerful drug. McCoy, who went through the Time Portal first, altered the past erasing all that came afterward. So, there is no Enterprise, no Starfleet, and no way to restore reality unless Kirk and Spock can stop McCoy in ""time.""

Yesterday's Enterprise, ST: Next Generation, Season 3. The U.S.S. Enterprise-D finds a bizarre rift in space, revealing an unidentified and badly damaged space vessel, which turns out to be the Enterprise-C, believed destroyed 20 years ago. The ship is in an alternate time line in which the Federation is at war with the Klingons. Security Officer Tasha Yar, who was killed in the line of duty in the present day, is alive on the Enterprise-C. Eventually, the Enterprise-C is sent back through the time rift to right events and stop the war. (Includes text commentary by Michael and Denise Okuda.)

Cause and Effect, ST: Next Generation, Season 5. The Enterprise crew are trapped in a time, causality loop and are traveling to their own destruction via a head-on collision with another Star Ship, the U.S.S. Bozeman, also trapped in the same loop. Eventually able to escape without colliding, the crew finds they had relieved the same day for 17 days, while the Bozeman crew had been trapped repeating events for 90 years.

Disc 2:

Time's Arrow Parts I & II, ST: Next Generation, Season 5/6. A cliff-hanging story arc that ended the fifth season and opened the sixth season of the series. The crew are in San Francisco when Data's head, very old and dusty, is discovered along with 19th century artifacts in a cavern. Investigating, they end up being transported to San Francisco in the late 1800's and have to deal with aliens who travel back and forth in time to steal neural energy from humans.

All Good Things, Part I &II, ST: Next Generation, Season 7. The final episodes in the series, Capt. Picard finds himself at the mercy of Q, suddenly traveling unbidden between the past, present and future while trying to prevent the destruction of all of humanity, which he learns he caused.

Disc 3:

Little Green Men, ST: Deep Space Nine, Season 4. Quark and Nog end up traveling to Earth in a shuttle but are caught in a time warp and crash land in July 1947 in Roswell, N.M.! (Includes text commentary Michael and Denise Okuda.)

Trials and Tribble-ations, ST: Deep Space Nine, Season 6. Fantastic episode with incredible special effects that blends footage from the episode The Trouble With Tribbles, from ST: The Original Series, with newly shot footage of the Deep Space Nine crew. The DS crew travels back in time 100 years to Space Station K-7 and The Enterprise to hunt for Arne Darvin who has used a Bajoran Orb of Time to find and try to kill Capt. Kirk. Great scenes of Sisco, Dax, Bashir and O'Brien appearing to interact with the original Enterprise crew.

Year of Hell, Part II & II, ST: Voyager, Season 8/9. Another cliffhanger that spans seasons. Voyager becomes the victim Krenim time weaponry, which continues to alter the present and the memories of the crew while experimenting with establishing its dominance in that region of space.

Disc 4:

Endgame, Parts I & II, ST: Voyager, Season 7. Ending the series, these episodes weave time travel in an emotionally charged story that results in Voyager's eventually triumphant return home, as well as the destruction of the evil Borg Queen.",1139529600,271,4798,4.751201923076923

2473651,5,B000CSUNLQ,"Great dvd collection for real ST fans.

 Some of the series best episodes involved time travel, including ""City on the Edge of Forever"" the episode where Captain Kirk and Spock (late Leonard Nimoy) travel through the time tunnel built by mysterious aliens to the 1930's depression era America.

 Other great episodes include TNG, ""Yesterday's Enterprise"", an awesome episode of an alternate universe where the Federation is a militaristic Navy in an intergalactic war against the Klingons that should have never happened (only Whoopi Goldberg knows the truth) Tasha Yar (Denise) makes an appearance. Whoopi has to convince Captain Picard that their timeline is wrong and that the war with the Klingons should not be.

 This episode is so fantastic it shows an exciting alternate reality of the Federation, and also makes one wonder what one's own life or world would be if historical events occurred differently.

A third great episode is where TNG crew find an alien time portal that leads to the late 1800's San Francisco where Mark Twain Samuel Clemens meet the cast.

2473684,4,B000CSUNLQ,"I have been a fan of Star Trek since the first original series.  When this Klingon fan collection DVD series first came out I immediately bought it because I really enjoyed all the Star Trek series when they showed the ""Warrior race"" Klingon episodes.  Even though I have seen this series several times, I recently decided to watch the entire collection for the fourth time.

I throughly enjoyed watching this series which includes the following: Disc 1:  Broken Bow (Star Trek Enterprise), Errand of Merch (Star Trek the Original Series), The trouble with tribbles (The orignal series).  Desc 2: A matter of honor (The next generation), Sins of the father (The next generation), Redemption part 1 and 2 (The next generation). Disc 3: The way of the warrior (Deep Space nine), The sword of Kahless (Deep space nine, Disc 4: Trials and tribble-ations (Deep space nine), Barge of the dead (Voyager).

In conclusion, if you are into the Klingon warrior race Star Trek series you will enjoy this collection, even though I agree with many of the previous reviewers that they could have added other Klingon episodes and made this a better collection.

It brings back all three original Klingons from the original series for Grabthar's hammer sake. Someone at Paramount should get a bat'leth up the wazzoo for that SNAFU! ""The Sword of Kahless"" could have been cut instead. And the FANS picked these? What fans? Anything like the ""TOP MEN"" from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""?

We definitely need a 2nd boxset because there is so much more good stories to have in another boxset.

All of the episodes in the set are a part of different story lines and are well written.

It even has a good container that it comes in that they actually spent some money on.

2473715,5,B000CSUNLQ,"A pretty good collection, even for the not so fanatical fans. The time travel episodes have always been some of the more interesting outings in the series and amongst these 'City on the edge of forever' is the most challenging in terms of ethics and plot complications. The script is what one would expect from Harlan Ellison who as a professional sci- fi writer has the vision and talent to push the somewhat restrictive boundaries of the original series. The other episodes are all interesting but the TNG are somewhat weaker and while they enjoy good ensemble performances, the scripts  remain 'cluttered' and lacking in dramatic tension. Overall, a good value and enjoyable purchase.",1204416000,,687,5.026315789473684

I might have chosen a couple of other episodes if it were up to me, but was not unhappy with any that were incuded.  I would definitely recommend this collection.",1202688000,,354,4.176470588235294
2473717,4,B000CSUNLQ,"These fan collectives are a brlliant addition to the Trek family of DVDs.  Surely only the most rabid and rich fans (rich in money AND in time!) could afford the thousands of dollars required to gather and watch all 5 series of Trek.  For those of us unblessed by such qualities, these fan collectives are most welcome.  Because Trek fans are among the most knowledgable (and most opinionated!) fans as a group, their populist choices to appear in these groupings of shows will represent the best episodes of each series.  It also allows the viewers to see many of the 2-part episodes together without having to buy separate seasons of the shows.  The only drawback is that these sets have been left entirely to the audiences' whims, without any overarching control.  Thus, ""City on the Edge of Forever"" is in the Captain's set too; ""Endgame"" is in the Borg Collective.  Finally, I'm disappointed that this set does not include anything from Enterprise: much of the 3rd season involved battle with a species with temporal weapons - were none of these shows more worthy that ""Little Green Men""?  Or worth putting on instead of ""Endgame"" that was already on the Borg Collective?  I'm also not sure about ""Tomorrow is Yesterday"" as the second ToS choice - I prefer ""All Our Yesterdays"" and even ""Assignment: Earth"" is about the same level.

This set includes:

Tomorrow is Yesterday (ToS) (3.5/5) - a damaged Enterprise accidentally travels to 1960s Earth.  In defending themselves, they destroy an airforce fighter and capture its pilot, who has a critical role in history.  How can the crew get home and restore the timeline?

City on the Edge of Forever (TOS) (5/5) - McCoy accidentally passes through the Guardian of Forever into 1930s Earth.  The timeline is changed and Kirk and Spock must right the timeline.  Guest-starring Joan Collins as an idealistic soup-kitchen missionary with whom Kirk falls in love.

Time's Arrow (TNG) (3.5/5) - In its original run, I remember being quite disappointed with this cliffhanger/premier combo.  It's certainly not as compelling as ""The Best of Both Worlds"" or ""Redemption"".  Archaeologists on Earth discover Data's head, which has been buried in a cave for 500 years.  In the course of their investigation, they discover time-travelling alien soul-sucking vampires (?!) on Earth at the end of the 19th century.

Cause and Effect (TNG) (5/5) - The precursor to the feature film, ""Groundhog Day"" - the Enterprise experiences the same day over and over after being stuck in a time-loop following collision with another ship.  Features the most compelling ""teaser"" segment of all Trek shows: the Enterprise is destroyed with all hands before the opening credits!

Yesterday's Enterprise (TNG) (5/5) - during the battle that destroys her, the Enterprise C is thrown into the timeline of the Enterprise D, altering the future so that the Klingons and Federation are at war, Tasha Yar is still alive (and obviously Worf is not a member of the Enterprise D's crew).  Only Guinan can sense the original timeline, and she must convince Picard to allow the Enterprise C to return to the battle (and sure destruction) to repair the timeline.  This episode is supurb, but sets the stage for the very unfortunate subplot of the half-human/half-Romulan Sela who plagues future Romulan-based episodes.

All Good Things (TNG) (4.5/5) - The series finale of Next Generation.  Q teleports Picard between three timelines - the ""present"" (season 7 of TNG), the past (Encounter at Farpoint, i.e. the beginning of Season 1), and the future, where Admiral Riker is in command of the Enterprise, the Klingons and Federation are no longer allies, and Picard is suffering from an Alzheimer-like disease.  Picard is set a puzzle to solve that will save humanity if he succeeds, but destroy the entire race if he fails.  A very interesting idea, but the solution is somewhat contrived, and the episode suffers on repeated viewings.

Little Green Men (DS9) (2/5) - the weakest show in the set.  Nog, Quark, and Rom become the Roswell aliens after an accident with their warp drive sends them to 1950s Earth.

Trials and Tibbleations (DS9) (5/5) - taking a page from ""Forrest Gump"", the crew of the Defiant chase a Klingon agent back in time.  The agent is trying to kill Kirk for interfering with Klingon plans during the TOS episode ""Trouble with Tribbles"".  One extremely clever and seamless special effect has Kirk questioning Chief O'Brien about his involvement in a fight on the space station.

Year of Hell (Voy) (3.5/5) - a species tries using a time-travelling weapon to wipe out its enemies and make itself all-powerful in its region of space.  Unfortunately, its ""incursions"" in space-time always have unintended consequences.  The Voyager is caught in the middle by virtue of its temporal shielding, and attempts to find and destroy the temporal weapon while simultaneously taking on different iterations of the enemy species' conventional warships.

Endgame (Voy) 4/5 - The season finale of Voyager.  Admiral Janeway, 30 years in the future, returns to ""present time"" Voyager with technology and a plan to get the Voyager home 25 years early, thus saving the lives of those she knows will die (or, in Tuvok's case, go insane) before Voyager makes it to Earth in the normal way.  The plan involves a risky confrontation with Janeway's old nemesis, the Borg Queen, who is guarding a Borg-controlled wormhole-infested region of space.

As usual, this collective is bare-bones - text commentaries on ""Tomorrow is Yesterday"", ""Yesterday's Enterprise"", and ""Little Green Men"" are the only extras.  But for those not wishing to purchase many Trek shows/seasons, this is a great ""primer"" full of worthy episodes.",1198022400,5,5729,5.031813361611877

1. It's Star Trek.
2. It involves time travel.

2473719,4,B000CSUNLQ,"This collection of time travel episodes from the first four Star Trek series is mostly excellent. There are 12 episodes in all and quite a few of them are classics:

The City on the Edge of Forever from the original series is one such episode. McCoy is accidently injected with an overdose which makes him paranoid (and somewhat mad!). Subsequently he jumps through a time portal and Kirk and Spock have to follow to save him. Unfortunately McCoy will change Earth history, by saving a social worker from a car accident in the 1930's. This is a wonderful episode written by the Science Fiction author Harlan Ellison. The ending of this episode is what made the original Star Trek series such a great show.

My other favourite from this boxed set (on 4 discs) is Trials and Tribble-ations from the Deep Space 9 series 5. In this episode the crew of DS9 travel back in time 100 years and meet up the original Enterprise crew. This is very cleverly done and frequently very funny.

There are no bad episodes in the boxed set, even the Voyager episode (which I was never a big fan of) is pretty good. So if time travel is your thing then this is a good set to get.",1190419200,,1160,4.436619718309859

2473721,4,B000CSUNLQ,"I see plenty of unfortunate hostility toward the inclusion of ""Barge of the Dead"" on this collection, and I have to vehemently disagree. It has to be the most thoughtful, introspective, and insightful episodes of ""Voyager"", if not one of the most in the total Star Trek franchise. B'Elanna Torres was an intriguing and dynamic character that received as much attention and development as a show like ""Voyager"" would ever allow. I empathize with the disappointment toward ""Voyager"", a series that boasted all sorts of potential and very little follow-through. But ultimately ""Barge"" was one of that show's few bright spots.",1170720000,9,622,5.1683168316831685
2473722,4,B000CSUNLQ,"The fan collectives are really good star trek materials. But when Klingons are included in it it has lost its meaning in the process. Why because its not possible to please all klingon fans with just 4 discs. There had to be more.

Although they brought the key episodes for Klingons there are many with no meaning at all. We start with the best Klingon episodes from TOS.Then we continue with Enterprise but, come on do you really think that Enterprise's pilot is a klingon episode. Just it has klingons in it (for a couple of minutes, in a 90 minute show), it doesnt mean that it must be included in this collection. I mean i don't complain about enterprise but i don't think that this episode belongs to this collection. Then comes the great TNG episodes. Then we continue with some of the best DS9 episodes. Then again there is Sword of Kahless it's an okey episode but i would rather prefer ""You are cordially invited..."" to see the marital traditions of the Klingon race. Plus it would be more fun to watch. And there are more DS9 episodes about Klingons that could have been included in this collection.

And finally my last complaint: Voyager's the barge of the death. Horrible, i mean really horrible probably one of the lacking episodes of the great series Voyager. Probably they included this episode to just squeeze in Belonna Torres and Voyager in the collection.

Anyway, as always you get your money's worth with this collection. Plus text commenteries are very detailed and fun to read. I'm giving four stars because i believe there could be better klingon episodes in the collection. But then agian to receive the perfect Klingon collection they had make a 8 or 9 disc set.

Given that DS9 was full of exciting, complicated episodes that centered on Klingon characters, why were there only two episodes from that series in the entire collection?

2) I was charged for a 4 disc set, when they could have easily fit all those episodes on 3 discs. Moreover, given that more episodes could have been included on each of the discs, why weren't they? Doubtless Paramount wants to make certain that I keep buying seasons of DS9.",1164758400,6,605,4.7075471698113205

Kirk which is and always will be (in my opinion) the best captain out of all the Star Trek Series to Deep Space Nine and The Next Generation episodes.  They could have included a few more episodes as quite a few of them dealt with Tim Travel but you will enjoy this dvd set if you are a Star Trek Fan.  IF you can't afford to buy season 1, season 2 and so forth for hundreds of dollars.  This set is affordable and gives you a nice sampling of episodes from all of Star Trek's tv series.",1163721600,2,634,4.088709677419355
2473739,4,B000CSUNLQ,"I only wish that the set had two more episodes. The first one is ""day of the dove"" (TOS) with Kang. There were only three major Klingon episodes in TOS. Two of them are on here"" (Errand of Mercy"" has Kor, ""Trouble with Tribbles"" has Koloth.) but not the third one which is ""day of the dove"".
Because Worf was a main character in TNG and later DS9 there are many Klingon episodes in those series. So there is no way to include them all. With TOS however, just the addition of ""day of the dove"" would make it seem more complete. There, is another reason it could have been included. All three Klingon captains make an appearance in one DS9 episode mentioned below.

The episode ""Blood Oath"" from DS 9 could have been included. It has Kor, Koloth AND Kang (all three characters played by the orignal actors) in it. In fact, I think it would have been a better episode to include than ""the sword of Kahless"". (somehow the episode seems redundant to me. perhaps an inclusion of a ""b"" story would have made it a better episode""

For the TNG Klingon arc, ""Reunion"" should have been included. The events that happened here are after ""Sins of the Father"" and are referred to in Redemption (Worf killing Duras, the first apperance of Gowron, Picard becoming the arbiter etc).

 ""Barge of the dead"" seems like a token episode just to include at least one show from ""voyager"".

It is a good collection in the sense that it has shows from all the series. I have all of DS9 on DVD. So the ones in the set are repeats for me. (The Q collection, for example, has only one DS9 episode. The rest are TNG and Voyager only...but it is a good collection because it has EVERY Q episode in it. Unless you count the TOS episode ""Squire of Gothos""). ""The Way of the Warrior"" from DS9 gets a text commentary on here, (that isn't included on the DS9 Season 4 set) which I enjoy.

To sum it up. The collection would be more complete with the inclusion of
""Day of the Dove"" , ""Bload Oath"" and ""Reunion"". It would still fit on four discs.",1163462400,27,2008,4.341333333333333
2473740,5,B000CSUNLQ,"This is another collection of really good episodes that deal with Klingons. True, there were some episodes missing from this set and could have been included in the fourth disc, but overall the episodes are really great.

The main problem I had with the collection is that they chose the wrong Enterprise episode to put on here. Instead of Broken Bow, they should have had the episode from season four which expalined why the Klingons ridges are missing from the original series. It would have been a great addition, especially for the fans who have never seen that ENT story arch. It would have also been a great lead up to the TOS episodes.

I have all of the collectives; so I would say that out of the four collectives released so far, this would probably be my third favorite. The best collectives are no question the Borg and Q collections. With the Q collective, it is every episode of Trek he was on. And the Borg collective gives a very good history and understanding of the Borg and every episode in that collection deserves to be there. All of the episodes on the Borg collective were the right ones to pick. This ends up at third because the episodes feel more random and doesn't really flow with the storyline as the Borg or Q collective does. Time Travel is a very good collection, but it is definitely random episodes. With that said, this is still worth getting, but only to fans who don't own the DVDS. Like I said before in the other reviews, if you already have the seasons, then you are just paying for the box.",1158105600,4,1531,4.483870967741935

That was about as classic and unique time travel as could be.

How was that missed?",1157414400,5,305,4.846153846153846

I think the idea of ""fan collectives"" is great.  I have the Borg Collective, which is awesome.  And I don't think they left anything out, at least as far as I can remember.  So why not give the fans ALL the Klingon episodes?  This IS about the FANS, right??? Why be a bogart on the ""Day of the Dove"" action???

That was a dealbreaker for me.  I did not buy this collection, nor do I plan to.  You had me then you lost me.",1156723200,8,655,4.217741935483871
2473743,5,B000CSUNLQ,"Its a GOOD day to die-Worf

To watch this fan collection, you must keep in mind you won't get all your favorites in a FAN collection. And others have said this fact previously in their reviews and I echo this fact. You also must remember the studio (Paramount) is trying to milk its cash cow (STAR TREK) to death, so know they will be selective..sometime too selective for my tastes

Now in saying that previous statement and fact in the last paragraph,  I enjoyed what was here in this DVD Klingon  collection. It covered all the Treks with one to two episodes each of live action trek series including Enterprise. The episodes gives TREK fans a taste of Klingon. In also show the diverse ideals of the Klingon nation from Foe to Ally. Also this collection is a great character overview of the warror race.

However for TREK fans NOTE, especially for Tribble fans, It has the classic trek's Trouble with Tribble and the DS9 Salute Trials and Tribble-uations. But it does miss the animated More Tribbles, More Troubles (guess I have to wait until december for all the animated Trek box set!).

For what is here, its great. The DVD masters copies are clean and clear of defects. Notes, there is text comments on a few episodes but no actor commentary. One could hope for this collection that it would include an audio except from the Simon & Schuster audio's Conversational Klingon narrated by the greatest Klingon of all- Michael (Worf) Dorn , however no luck.

There are many missed episodes that they also could have included like Classic Trek's Day of the Dove, well we can hope there is a volume two of Klingon

So Paramount DVD, what's your next fan collection?  Vulcans  (including Spock)? Scotty? Data? Doctors? Orion Slave girls? The Fan DVD  collections have  already covered the Borg, Q and Time Travel...we can only hope whats next

Until then Live Long and Prosper

2473754,4,B000CSUNLQ,"As one that has been a fan of all things ""Trek"" since Gene Roddenberry's vision came to light forty years ago, it's not difficult to be critical of the show. These collective sets allow us fans to look and dissect the various incarnations, citing their similarities and differences.

Culled from an online poll of fans, the Klingon Collective offers one of the best methods of assessment yet. The viewer gets to see, in chronological order, the development of one of the most enigmatic (and popular) races to be featured in the history of Trek. Starting with the pilot of ""Enterprise"" (in an episode that somewhat alters previous storylines about the race), the set is intriguing but shows the strengths and weaknesses of tales of ""The Klingon Empire.""

When viewing the episodes from the original series (""Errand of Mercy"" and ""The Trouble with Tribbles"") one sees how different the Klingons of old look when compared to their present appearance, a ""look"" that has its origin in ""Star Trek-The Motion Picture"" - the ""change"" being later explained in a fourth season episode of ""Enterprise."" An almost seamless melding of the original series and ""Deep Space Nine"" is ""Trials and Tribulations,"" which incorporates scenes allowing characters from the later show interacting with actors and situations from the first one.

The four from ""Star Trek: The Next Generation,"" including the two-part ""Redemption,"" are essential in the understanding of the warrior race. One of the revelations about back-to-back viewing of the Klingons is to notice how contradictory their touting of honor really is. For all their ""chest-thumping"" bravado and posturing, the Klingons are a bunch of loud barbarians, especially evident in ""Redemption."" However, the same episode provided the series with one of its most stunning surprises: the reappearance of former cast member Denise Crosby, now assaying a Romulan that has some connection between this part and her earlier character.

The five episodes from ""Deep Space Nine"" support my opinion that this was the best show of the franchise, offering more detailed and involving stories and the best acting. Not only did the show feature a superb regular cast (Avery Brooks, Rene Auberjonois, Nana Visitor, Terry Farrell, Armin Shimerman, and Colm Meaney), there were great turns from recurring members Andrew J. Robinson (""Garek"") and Marc Alaimo (""Gul Dukat""), to cite just two. Playing Klingons on more than one occasion are the wonderfully bug-eyed Robert O'Reilly (""Gowron""), J.G. Hetzler (""Martok""), and John Colicos, one of the few actors to play a Klingon in both the original and this show.

Michael Dorn, who is featured on the cover, plays ""Worf,"" one of the most popular characters of all, having assayed the role in ""Next Generation,"" the theatrical films, and the last four years of ""Deep Space Nine.""

The single installment from ""Voyager"" offers more insight into the Klingon mythos, allowing the underused Roxan Dawson a chance to be the center of a story. Though not quite as captivating as the other entries, it's still a fitting conclusion to the set.

Hopefully, collective TWO will have the other Klingon-based shows, for there are several others worthy of addition.",1155600000,2,3214,5.18111753371869
2473755,5,B000CSUNLQ,"This is a great set and really shows how the conception of Klingons evolved over the course of five series (so they should have put the  Enterprise ep on last!).  Errand of Mercy is far superior to Day of the Dove, and The Trouble with Tribbles is a classic that just can't be left off.  As for TNG--I think that A Matter of Honor is superior to Heart of Glory which is a bit one-note, and the fan collectives have been a bit light on Riker, so I'm glad that this is included here.  While I would have enjoyed classic Suzy Plakson and Alexander episodes--the other TNG eps are about Klingons, not just about Worf, so they fit.  The disc three DS9 episodes are great action pieces, and I for one don't mind the T & T-lations double dip as much as some of the others between the four sets (at least it's just one ep instead of the double-length TNG and Voyager finales).  Also--there's a very good text commentary for this episode that wasn't included in the time travel set.  Barge of the Dead seems like an appropriate choice for Torres and Voyager.

I can understand the point of view of those who point out some missing classics from each series--but in fact this is a good Klingon set as opposed to being all Worf all the time.  Dorn is featured on the cover, at any rate, which seems to be very appropriate!  The finale of Enterprise infuriated me so much that I refuse to watch any ep of that show--so I'm glad that they only used the pilot here and no later Klingon-centered shows that I understand hadn't been shown in time for voting.  The collectives are very light on Enterprise eps, and I for one am glad (with apologies to that show's fans).

Double-dipping can't spoil the joy of owning classic Star Trek episodes without being required to buy 28 seasons of shows which it would be tough to really watch and enjoy in any lifetime.  I really like skipping from series to series, and owning a collection that takes up a very small amount of shelf space and can be viewed in a few afternoons.  I've bought all four sets, and despite skipping all Enterprise episodes, as well as the Hugh/Borg trilogy, I feel like I've gotten my money's worth and like I have a representative sample of more than 30 years of Star Trek.  For the price of just a season and a half of any one of the 5 series, I have four great thematic sets that I really enjoy.",1155513600,3,2351,4.360091743119266

There is the wonderful performance as the lead Klingon, Michael Ansara as ""Kang"". Maybe the best performance to date - and featuring the first female Klingon in Star Trek television history.

Also a first in Day of the Dove is inter-ship beaming.

This 'Klingon"" episode from the original series had on top of all this a great story concerning war and peace without hitting you over head with its message.

2473760,5,B000CSUNLQ,"There are many good Klingon episodes that could have easily been put on this set. Three of my favorites which were left off are:

 NEXT GENERATION: ""The Emissary"" which has the versatile Suzie Plakson playing Federation-Klingon Liaison K'Ehleyr, who is half-human (mother)/half-Klingon (father). She is a love interest from Worf's past. Besides the insight as to what passes for Klingon romance (holo deck combat is a turn on), this is a pivotal episode for Worf, because this encounter produces his son Alexander who will figure in many future episodes. How this could be left out astounds me.

 DEEP SPACE 9: ""Blood Oath"" This episode reunited three Klingons from the original Star Trek series: Kor, Koloth and Kang. These three still spry warriors team up with Dax to exact revenge on an old nemesis who killed the three Klingons first-born as an act of vengeance. The current Dax made the oath in a previous incarnation but still feels bound to it, but that is mainly a device for reintroducing the three Klingons in their updated form.

 DEEP SPACE 9: ""House of Quark"" which is a great contrast between the Ferengi capitalist values and the Klingon warrior values. Quark kills a Klingon by accident. Under Klingon law, if a warrior dies in battle, the victor gets his estate---including his wife. If he dies by accident, the government gets his estate (no honor in being stupid or clumsy). Quark has to take credit for the kill to aid the widow Grilka; but discovers a rival Klingon house has been using economic warfare against the estate. This is not honorable combat, though it is something a Ferengi understands well. At the end, lawyers may get a kick out of how Klingons get a divorce.

 Science fiction allows human traits to be taken to an extreme in the form of alien races. The original Star Trek did this with the famous Kirk-Spock-McCoy triangle, where the Captain had to draw on, and integrate, the extremes of logic and emotion shown by his two comrades. The lesson is that anything can be dangerous (or foolish) if taken to extremes, but to be successful, we must be able to draw on many traits and use what is needed at the time.",1154476800,7,2150,4.745308310991957
2473761,5,B000CSUNLQ,"For those who are Star Trek followers but can't afford the very steep price of the regular seasonal dvds, Star Trek Fan Collective - Time Travel is a definite must have. The Fan Collectives Borg & Q are also worth dropping your hard-earned dollars for. I myself am a huge fan of the time travel concept so I jumped at the chance to own this box set. This collection contains some of my favorite Trek episodes: ""Yesterday's Enterprise,""  ""Time's Arrow,"" ""All Good Things,"" ""Trials and Tribble-ations,"" ""Endgame,"" and the all-time classic ""The City on the Edge of Forever"" (boy, Joan Collins never was sexier).

I've no gripe with the episodes that made it to this box set; they are all great representatives of their particular series. Several time travel episodes I thought could have been included are:

""Timescape"" (ST: TNG) - On board a runabout, Picard & several crew members rendezvous with the Enterprise only to discover their starship frozen in time and moments away from annihilation.

""The Visitor"" (ST: DS9) - Tony Todd guest stars as the adult Jake Sisko attempting to save his father, who is trapped in temporal limbo.

""Future's End (Parts 1 & 2)"" (ST: Voyager) - A face off with a futuristic Federation timeship temporally catapults Voyager back into 20th century Earth.

""Storm Front (Parts 1 & 2)"" (Enterprise) - Archer and his Enterprise crew find themselves back in time in an altered WW2 Earth, having been influenced by the Temporal Cold War.

Special features present text commentaries on three episodes: ""Tomorrow Is Yesterday"" (Star Trek: The Original Series), ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" (Star Trek: TNG), and  ""Little Green Men"" (Star Trek: DS9).

How about a Fan Collective of all the episodes involving the Holodeck? The seminal ""The Big Goodbye"" and ""Elementary, Dear Data"" have to be solidly in that compilation, as well as the rollicking ""Bride of Chaotica,"" while the cute ""Take Me Out to the Holosuite"" (ST: DS9) might also make it. Anyways, any chance to revisit with Dixon Hill, Data's Sherlock Holmes, Prof. Moriarty, Captain Proton, Arachnia (and her irresistible pheromones), and Lt. Barclay is a very good thing indeed.",1154217600,11,2155,5.030898876404494

2473764,5,B000CSUNLQ,"One of the greatest things that TNG did was to transform Klingons from simple evil enemies (in ST) into a highly complex culture that is at a watershed:  evolve and become part of the intergalactic community, or simply fall into the old patterns of fighting.  These themes are wonderful and deep, played by truly excellent actors and quite spell-binding in their drama.  This is the best that I have ever seen on TV.

What is great about this set is that the most important episodes are united in a way that is easy to access.  Here, in a quick longitudinal way, the viewer can witness the evolution of the crucial parts of the Klingon evolution from the original series through TNG and other series. Other reviewers have described the specifics of the episodes, so I won't.

In a way, I wish that I had waited before purchasing the entire boxed set of TNG.  Not only are all the bum episodes included - at least one in four on each disk - but if you want to follow a story such as that provided by the Klingon plight, you have to play a bunch of disks and each episode is very hard to find.  It is extremely cumbersome.

So here, you get ease as well as the cream of the crop of TNG and other series by theme. I wish I had wiated until these sets came out!

Instead of Endgame, they could have had four more episodes in its place, but that's only a minor complaint. I'm very happy that they have included ""City on the Edge of Forever"".

Okay, that's a tad extreme because the Klingon cash cow died during season 6 of TNG.  Didn't stop them from burying things even deeper...

The disaster starts with ""Broken Bow"" of all possible stories.  Why?  THAT is a fan favorite story?!  (and given how patchwork Klingon continuity is, the production team for ""Enterprise"" only serve to confuse people not familiar with the franchise when not boring those who are familiar with the franchise.)

Then we get a halfway decent story with ""Errand of Mercy"".  Of course, then comes ""The Trouble with Tribbles"".  So far, no Worf to flesh out nearly a decade worth of Klingondom.

Then on disc 2 is when we start getting Worfy:  ""A Matter of Honor"", ""Sins of the Father"", ""Redemption"" pts 1 and 2 are presented.  This is the best disc of the bunch, even though ""Redepemption"" pt 2 is an embarrassment.

Sadly enough, no further escapades of Worf and Klingonese from TNG are presented on the remaining discs.  Disc 3 features ""The Way of the Warrior"" (a decent story where the Klingons and Federation break up their relationship, but only for a while because that would put Worf in a bad place again...)  And then ""The Sword of Kahless"".  A yawner.  Note this disc contains 3 rather than 4 episodes.  Surely they couldn't find one of about 50 honorable mentions???

Disc 4 is even more whittled down, with only 2 episodes!  ""Trials and Tribble-ations"" (a charming yet pretentious retconning of established history just so the newer production team could feel better about themselves) and ""Barge of the Dead"".  A fitting story to end this set with, for even the Kazon weren't a sufficient ripoff of Klingons so they had to be shoehorned into ""Voyager"" too.

Fortunately, none of the episodes here can really be shoehorned into other sets.  (except for possibly ""Trials and Tribbleations"", which uses a Bajoran Time Orb to transport everybody through time... and quite a lot of space too :D )

There's really little here that's venerable; except the stories on disc 2, as that sets up Worf's saga.  yet there's room for 3 more stories in this set, which would have been more fitting for Worf's continuing saga in ""The Next Generation"", of which ""Birthright"" would be one contender (of many)...  but no doubt they'll shove out a followup ""Klingon II - The Wrath of Near-Bankruptcy"" soon enough.  :D",1148169600,15,2445,4.787081339712919

2473772,3,B000CSUNLQ,"I'm surprised they're leaving out ""Heart of Glory"" the first encounter of the Klingons by TNG viewers. It's our first chance to see Klingons in a new light and to learn that not only are they impressive warriors, but also that their warrior ways are guided by a strong sense of honor. We also learn that they live life to the fullest (perhaps why they're so fierce) because they believe that once dead, the body is ""just an empty shell."" Likewise, by leaving out ""Soldiers of the Empire"" we're missing out on another piece of the Klingon puzzle, as this episode shows not only the Klingon rites of succession, but also their Viking-esque lust for glory in battle. I do believe the collection has some important episodes for we Klingon fans, but it seems to be missing the heart of this race. As for the fan collection vs. yearly collection debate, I side with the fan collection. All of the series have their weak moments, and to pay an outrageous price and only get a few episodes you might enjoy, is similar to the days before iTunes, when we had to buy any record a group put out even if all we wanted were the ""cool"" songs. Before the fan collection, I was relegated to buying the VHS version of individual episodes. It's hard for a sci-fi fan to live with old technology.",1145836800,11,1276,4.48068669527897
2473783,2,B000CSUNLQ,"Unlkike the Borg set, I do not care for this set.  Why are there no episodes from Enterprise?",1145750400,,93,4.166666666666667
2473784,5,B000CSUNLQ,"This is an excellent collection covering Trek lore about the Klingons from ""Enterprise"" through to ""Voyager"". It is missing some key episodes for example the episode from ""Enterprise"" where we find out how the Klingons lost the bumps on their heads for a long period of time (during the original ""Star Trek"")and since this is a four disc set it could have been filled out with a few more episodes from ""Deep Space Nine"". While I'm not disappointed in this set it could have included quite a few more episodes including ""Day of the Dove"" a classic third season episode of The Original Series.

The episodes for this set are as follows:

Enterprise: Broken Bow. Captain Archer and the new crew of Enterprise are charged with returning a Klingon with information that could avert a war. The Sooliban an alien speices involved with a temporal war has been charged with stopping Archer and killing the Klingon.

Star Trek The Original Series: Errand of Mercy.
Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock are trapped on an alien world of pacificist by invading Klingons where they were trying to convince the aliens to join the Federation. Kirk and Spock use terrorist tactics to try and create a revolt among the aliens not knowing that they have their own agenda.

The Trouble with Tribbles: Klingons show up at a space station where the Enterprise is protecting a grain shipment. The Klingons and the Enterprise crew come into conflict on the station while Kirk has to figure out how to best protect the important grain shipment.

ST: THe Next Generation: A Matter of Honor, Sins of the Father, Redemption Part 1 & 2

These four important Next Gen episode provide us with a unique glimpse into the Klingon mind and universe. Commander Riker serves on a Klingon ship as part of an officer exchange program. When the captain of the Pagh suspects that the Enterprise deliberately infected his ship with a corrosive bacteria he decides to attack Enterprise.

""Sins of the Father"": Enterprise receives a Klingon exchange officer who claims to be Worf's brother. He tells Worf that their name is about to shamed and that their deceased father is to be labeled a traitor for the massacre at Khitomer. Worf must turn to Captain Picard to be his advocate with the Klingon High Counsel to save his honor.

""Redemption Parts 1 & 2"": Two the best Next Gen episodes featuring the Klingons, this two part episode serves as sequels to ""Sins of the Father"". Worf's family was discommendated by the Klingon High Counsel. When the new emperor Gowron insists on Federation involvement Picard turns him down he refuses to help restore Worf's family name. Civil War breaks out among the Klingons and Worf elects to serve with Gowron and battle the faction trying to take down Gowron.

Deep Space Nine: ""The Way of the Warrior"",""The Sword of Kahless"", ""Trials and Tribble-ations"". Three strong episodes from DS9 the last one is a whimsical visit to ""Star Trek: The Original Series"" where the crew of the Defiant must travel back in time to stop a Klingon saboteur from changing history in the episode ""The Trouble with Tribbles"".

Star Trek Voyager: ""Barge of the Dead"". When Torres is injured in a shuttle accident she finds herself on the Barge of the Dead traveling to Gre'thor or Klingon Hell where the dishonored souls go.

I suspect we'll have the usual assortment of text commentary from Michael and Denise Okuda. I wouldn't expect any audio commentaries on this set however. The package design featuring a prominet picture of Worf is similar to the other fan collectives that have been released. The ""Enterprise"" episodes are in widescreen, the others are all full screen releases. The image quality will reflect the individual sets these are drawn from as Paramount is using the same transfers as the boxed sets.",1145664000,82,3779,4.8343653250774
2473785,5,B000CSUNLQ,"""Time Travel"" is an outstanding collection of episodes from 4 of the 5 Star Trek series, with only ""Enterprise"" not making the cut.  Star Trek fans who do not want to spend exorbitant amounts getting some of their favorite episodes are once again well-served by their fellow ""Trekkies"" choices in this Fan Collective.

Others have episode reviews, so I will stick to aesthetics.  For starters, check out ""The City On The Edge Of Forever"" which is universally acclaimed as the best Star Trek episode ever (even if writer Harlan Ellison remains peeved at Gene Roddenburry for messing with his script).  The episode is an amazing 50 minutes long -- when shown in syndication, it is usually cut down to about 46 minutes, start-to-finish.  You also can see creeping commercialization in the other episodes as most last about 45 minutes.  The most recent series, ""Enterprise"", has an episode in the Borg Fan Collective that is only 42 minutes long!  So enjoy ALL the episodes in their uncut versions and note the changes in how much Star Trek you get in an hour of television in the 1960's versus the 1990's or later.  Hard to believe they sold only 9 minutes of commercials per hour of TV when today it's closer to 15-17 minutes, depending.

As mentioned, no episodes from ""Enterprise"" made the cut.  This is too bad, as I thought a few episodes involving time travel were very good (though confusing).  I would not have minded a 5th disk in the set to allow for a few more episodes.  Otherwise, no arguments with the choices of Star Trek fans.  You get 2 episodes from ST:TOS, 4 episodes from ST:TNG, 2 episodes from ST:DS9, and 2 episodes from ST:VOY (note:  I count 2-parters as one episode each).  I was somewhat surprised that ""Year Of Hell"" 1 & 2 made the cut from ST:VOY as I didn't think it stood out relative to other ST:VOY episodes or other time-travelling episodes (including those from ST:ENT).  But hey, the fans have spoken, right?

There is overlap in some of the series and this will certainly continue with the forthcoming release of the ""Q"" Fan Collective.  If I were Paramount, I would have not allowed episodes to appear in more than one Fan Collective.  This would have made Voyager's series finale ""Endgame"" appear in either the Borg or Time Travelling Fan Collective, but not both as they do now.  This would have freed up space to allow for more variety in the episodes.  Having to purchase a few Fan Collectives to get all the ""Q"", Borg, and Time Travel episodes is still far cheaper than having to buy all the series DVD's.  But this is a minor quibble in the grand scheme of getting 10 episodes from a variety of series for not much more than the price of a movie DVD purchase price.

Trivia buffs will want to check out Officer Kirk from ""Happy Days"" in ST:TOS ""Tomorrow Is Yesterday"" and Joan Collins 15 years before she was a ""Dynasty"" star in ""The City On The Edge Of Forever.""  ""All Good Things..."" looks great, considering it really gets butchered by the cutting room when split into 2-parts on TV.  ""Trials and Tribble-ations"" is great for the splicing of ST:DS9 with ST:TOS footage -- I wish ST:TNG and ST:VOY had done an episode like that in their runs.

All in all, this is a worthwhile series to own.  More text commentaries from the Okuda's or others who worked on the series would have been nice.  The picture transfers are fine; pixelation is minimal on big-screen TV's and the DVD's really sparkle on an HDTV with a progressive scan DVD player.  All the episodes are in the 4:3 aspect ratio.  The front cover has a nice shot of Kirk which is appropriate since ST:TOS really started the time-travelling genre.

The Fan Collectives in general and this set in particular should Live Long and Prosper.",1145577600,9,3735,4.639269406392694
2473786,5,B000CSUNLQ,"I'm so looking forward for this Star Trek box set. I already have the Borg and Time Travel ones. I also plan to get the Q one. Although the episode list for the Klingon set is not known yet I would like to offer the 10 stories that I believe could be included:

1) Broken Bow - Enterprise

2) Affliction & Divergence - Enterprise

3) Errand Of Mercy - The Original Series

4) Day Of The Dove - The Original Series

5) Sins Of The Father - The Next Generation

6) Reunion - The Next Generation

7) Redemption Parts I & II - The Next Generation

8) Blood Oath - Deep Space Nine

9) The Way Of The Warrior - Deep Space Nine

10) Apocalypse Rising - Deep Space Nine

Keep in mind that, as in the previous sets, we get 10 stories, not 10 episodes. This is because the two-parters count as 1 single story.

Of course, there's more Klingon stories, including Voyager's ""Faces"" which I love, but I believe these eps are the ones that are more in tone with the entire Klingon arc. What do you think?",1145232000,12,990,4.152631578947369
2473787,4,B000CSUNLQ,"Paramount's second Star Trek Fan Collective set, Time Travel, is a pretty good testament to favorite-episode-voting Trekkies everywhere.
The first great thing about this 4-disc collection is, once again, that we are given more than the advertised 10 episodes.  The twelve chosen for this set contain some of the most classic and most fun Trek episodes from The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager.
Some highlights:  Disc 1 offers one no brainer for this collection from TOS: City on the Edge of Forever; once you rewatch it, you recall just why this is a no brainer.  This episode takes one of TOS's stereotypical outlandish plots and turns it into something much more: a very dramatic and moving story.  Disc 1 also contains(among others) Cause and Effect, TNG's Groundhog Day, sans Bill Murray.
Disc 2 features, of course, All Good Things, which shines brightly among the great series finales among the Trek mythos, and certainly is a must have for any fan.
The fun element is definitely on Disc 3 with two great DS9 episodes, Little Green Men and Trials and Tribble-ations.  These aren't the finest DS9 episodes out there, but are certainly entertaining, even for the casual viewer who knows little about Star Trek.  Year of Hell Parts 1 and 2(VOY) are also two fine episodes, highlighting Janeway's ""I'm the captain dang it!"" mentality.
And of course Disc 4 contains Endgame... again.  Many devoted Trekkies now have this episode one DVD three times or more.
This set also features the episodes Tomorrow is Yesterday(TOS), Yesterday's Enterprise(TNG), and Time's Arrow Parts I and II(TNG).

Overall, this set is a nice follow-up to the first Fan Collective(Borg).  It's not quite as good as its predecessor, lacking the story-arc feel of the sequential Borg episodes, but it's certainly a good view; it's entertaining as DVDs and Star Trek are meant to be, and, again, it's offering great, classic Trek episodes those of us who haven't yet won the lottery.",1144886400,8,1991,5.009090909090909
2473788,5,B000CSUNLQ,"I'd have to say that of the Collective DVDs this has to be the best.  Time Travel episodes have often been the most entertaining of all episodes from TOS thru Voyager.

2473792,4,B000CSUNLQ,"These lower priced boxed sets are a good way to review all your old favorites from the various trek series.  You avoid two of the pitfalls found in the alternative of purchasing all individual seasons: firstly, even at a reduced price, you will end up spending considerably more on individual seasons; secondly, having a bookshelf devoted to startrek is not always socially the wisest course of action.  For those who make the leap and fully indulge in their passion for Trek, I make no judgments.  Personally, I would like to enjoy my sci-fi fix with a little bit more subtlety than a 28 season marathon in my room and few more dollars in my pocket.

The episodes chosen seem to capture the theme of each boxed set very well, and it would be nice to see a ""Startrek: Classics"" set with no particular theme, just those good episodes that were fun to watch.  I like the 'Time Travel' Collection more than the `Borg' collection because the episodes seem to have a little more variety within that theme.  The Next Generation episodes present a much broader spectrum of that show than the 'Borg' collection manages.  Also, the two Original Series episodes that are included are pretty fun to watch.  For starters, they are much more funny than I remember watching- maybe that's because now that I'm an adult the acting stands out a little more, and the special effects almost spoof the scifi genre.  But, this is one of the places it all began, and it is highly enjoyable to revisit the old classics.  Both DS9 and Voyager have solid episodes, but The Next Gen is the centerpiece of this collection.

I will fault the selections for the overlap that is present in each theme.  I'm not positive, but I don't think you can purchase any two sets without re-purchasing at least one episode.",1144108800,5,1782,4.65814696485623

As the Enterprise/its crew went back in time to make (Anthropological observations of humanity at a crucial period in Earth history) The crucial Edith Keeler episode was included however.
