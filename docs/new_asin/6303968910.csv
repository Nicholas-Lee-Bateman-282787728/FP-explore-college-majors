This  anime, for me, is one of the funniest out there and I've seen most of them  - warning; you have to pay attention! The dialog is fast and you can miss  the acronyms ie-agedly challenged = A.C.H.E. and how about the -Special  Homes In The Sun = ;-) - if you really enjoy anime, buy it! It's certainly  worth renting at least once. ps - I wrote this to push an unfair review  down the list, so, if you don't agree with me, that's fine, you can sound  off about it to me at JJsWorld@kc.rr.com.

Haruko decides it's her responsiblity to save him, and things go nuts  when the Z-001 begins believing it is his dearly departed wife, which is  what Takazawa really needs.

748596,4,6303968910,"Friday, July 15, 2005 / 4 of 5 / Entertaining, light early 90's chase anime

While at once amusing and alarming prescience, this early 90's anime tells a tale of the aging of Japan and the issues the elderly will impose upon the care giving industry.  Not the typical anime subject matter, but things kick into gear as a veiled group introduces a super-mecha bed that will tend to the needs of the elderly, bathing, feeding, taking care of their waste, etc. all controlled via a super computer and nuclear furnace.  The bed has some hidden capabilities however, and the first test case, an old man, is taken along for a wild ride.  The man's human nurse and her friends give chase along with the bed's company when it takes on the personality of the man's deceased wife.  What ensues is a chase as the bed tries to take the man to the beach.  Must be seen to be believed.  Funny and breezy, it's highly recommended.",1121385600,5,915,4.475903614457831
748597,4,6303968910,"This movie is silly, disgusting and satirical.  There is a lot here that resembles Akira: detailed designs, solid direction,  changing alliances, activist young people, and over-the-top transformations.",1080259200,,202,6.444444444444445
748598,5,6303968910,"This is a wonderfully funny movie about health care. The story has some very unbelievable spot, well nearly half the movie, but that doesn't matter. This is a typical comical anime. I would recommend it to all who like animes like the Slayers, or Sakura Wars.",1034553600,,259,4.6521739130434785
748599,4,6303968910,"INTRO:  To start, I was kinda' dissapointed when I figured out this wasn't the DVD release with the extras on it.  But then I found out that the ""movie"" itself wasn't too bad either. :)
DVD:  The DVD basically was easy enough to get to the movie so I can't say anything bad about the menus or anything.  The basic - Jap/Eng audios are available, which is always a must for anime or foreign films.
EXTRAS:  There are none on this version of the DVD so I can't complain too much since its my own fault...by the Special Edition for extras.
STORY/PLOT:  This movie is very good.  It almost (but not quite) beats Akira (also by Katsuhiro Otomo) in the fact that it mixes a lot of aspects from Akira and incorporates it into a PG-13 (at most) rated movie.  Even though they say this movie is about PG-13, I could show this to a kid with no worries really.  But then again, that's just me...The movie explains about taking care of the elderly and manages to mix in some great action as well.  Its too strange to explain, so just see it to believe me.
OVERALL:  Overall, I really liked this movie/dvd. I recommend it to anyone that likes Anime, AKira, or works by Katsuhiro Otomo.  I will still get the Special Edition for the extras, but this version (the one that started it for me) will always remain in my DVD library.",1029801600,5,1314,4.340163934426229
748600,3,6303968910,"Movies in general and anime in particular are a medium of art, and can be used to intrigue, provoke, and express criticism (in the case of this movie, social criticism), which is all welcome; but some movies get so caught up with the point they're trying to make that they forget they are not just some manifesto but also a piece of entertainment, and in this respect Roujin Z is too unfocused. Is it an action movie? No, since there's in fact only one action scene at the end. Is it a comedy? It could have been, and it had great potential, especially with some of the older characters, but it just doesn't make an effort to be a comedy. Is it a drama? Hardly - how can it be with one of its lead characters (the old man) saying maybe three or four sentences during the movie? In short, the movie is so involved with the message it is trying to get across that it forgets it also has to entertain, and a movie which does not entertain is, in my eyes, as good as a piece of art which does not provoke some sense ot beauty, or a book which you have to struggle to get through.
On the technical side, animation quality isn't so high at the beginning of the movie, but towards the end and the action that accompanies it, it makes a quantum leap and reaches very high standards (*anime* standards, that is), say, those of Wings of Honneamise or some Miyazaki movie. As always I salute the animators for breathing such life into the characters, but this does not redeem the movie. In short, rent before you buy.",1019001600,2,1506,4.306338028169014
748601,5,6303968910,"It's an unspoken rule in film production that any movie with an all star cast or crew is going to be terrible, take the recent movie ""A.I."" for example. Roujin Z manages to break the mold. The film was designed by Katsuhiro Otomo, (famous for his previous work AKIRA)directed by Hiroyuki Kitakubo (worked on Patlabor-The Movie with Mamoru Oshii) and animated by Fumio Iiada (Wings of Honneamise). The visual style is an interresting blend between Iiada's and Otomo's artwork, the animation is very high quality (though somewhat outdated), and the character designs and motion capturing are some of the best I've ever seen. The story takes place in Japan, where the government is having difficulting dealing with it's aging population. The solution? The new Z-001, a robotic bed to cover a patients every need. Elderly invalid Takazawa is volunteered by his family to test the new bed, and is thus stripped from his volunteer nurse, Haruko. When Takazawa's bed sends out a distress signal Haruko and her friends race to the rescue, but the bed has become more than just a simple care unit. Now the bed has become an unstoppable robot, imbued with the personality of Takazawa's deceased wife and hell bent on visiting the beach! It should be noted that this film was published in the US by USMANGA Corps, the sorriest bunch of adled sods that have ever disgraced the animation industry (disney aside). The dubbing is, of course, horrible beyond belief, so stick to the subtitles.",998006400,4,1477,4.912
748602,3,6303968910,"I bought this movie on a whim, what i got was worth the money, but jus barely. the story in general was very funny, well planned and really makes you think about how we treat our elders (Not as people but as burdens) and the characters were very fun and you could easly relate to them however, there is little action and the animation is somewhat poor.  I would recomend this movie to people who understand wit, sarcasm, and social satire.  In other words, any one who thought that dumb and dumber was an excelent flim will hate this movie.",993945600,3,540,4.39

Provides a interesting view of the way the ACHS (Aged Challenged) are treated. I just wish more people cared like the main character.
The english verison is better than the subtitled or orginal Japanese because of the additional jokes.
If your looking for a ultra violent/fighting anime, don't get this. There is some fighting-after all, this is an anime movie, but it's satire that makes this movie great.",987552000,2,477,4.901234567901234

7857844,3,6303968910,"Growing tired and frustrated with caring for the elderly simply because it's cost demanding and physically taxing. The government plans on putting to action ""Project Z"". They build a supercomputer dubbed Z-001, which is in the form of a bed that is linked to a persons brainwaves, and in theory provides all of the essential needs to care for them, which sounds like a great idea. However, it's devoid of the caring emotion that one needs from other people. Their first unwilling patient is Mr. Takazawa. The nurse caring for him named Haruko is uneasy about his situation, and she attempts to free him but there is more to the bed itself than expected.-summary

 I'm not a rocket scientist and I never claimed to be one, but it doesn't take one to see the primary reason why this anime film is hailed as a classic. Can anyone guess why? Well, it's written by the creator of Akira himself Katsuhiro Otomo. Therefore, this film is great and it's a classic because he can do no wrong. Personally, I never bought into Akira's masterpiece status, and I don't buy into this films status as great anime either. I find it to be decent at best.

 It appears that Otomo was shooting for something thought provoking and he succeeded. Roujin Z definitely has a very interesting concept. I do know what it's like to help take care for an older person whom can't feed or wash themselves. It can definitely feel like a burden a lot of the time, and sometimes one could just wish that the person would go away. It's a very evil and selfish way of thinking but that's human nature.

 The film uses these feelings to establish an emotional link with the viewer, and at the same time it provides a solution to their problem. The people's reaction to the first live display of the bed's capabilities is proof. At first, the direction was pretty well done painting a picture of the selfish nature of people. Some of the folks in the audience were even uttering that they can now take a vacation. They completely ignored that the person still needs care from other human beings. Otomo had something serious and really deep going on here, but decided to turn it into a satire of Japan's feelings towards the elderly. I wish he could have been more serious with this one.

 I really didn't care for the direction that the film went, and I wasn't gripped by the plot at all. The film dabbles between comedy and action in the form of a silly cast, as well as uninteresting mecha fights. The only reason why my rating doesn't plummet any lower is because the mecha battle and wacky madness is actually necessary. They play into the themes and the heavy symbolism taking place with Takazawa. The substance present in the film can seriously have some viewers saying ""Wow!"", once everything finally comes together. I really didn't have a problem with the music, because it fits well with the comedy and action but there's nothing truly note worthy. This also goes for the voice acting which didn't stand out to me for neither language.

 The bit of comedy present certainly delivers through the animation and artwork. The facial expressions can be funny on certain occasions, and the action scenes have decent animation. The viewer gets to know several characters personalities somewhat but there isn't much for character development outside of Takazawa.

 Overall, I feel Roujin Z is worth a watch to the more serious anime fan. It's not something I'll be watching again and I don't consider it bad, but it could have done without the silliness. If you come into this searching for loads of blood and action, or even a dark angst ridden story shades of Akira. Then you'll definitely be disappointed.

Highs: Realistic and interesting concept

Lows: Typical characters, weak plot half way through",1446681600,,3767,4.713850837138509
7857845,2,6303968910,"First of all I'd like to say that I think this film is an absolute classic, particularly the English dub. It's a hilarious over-the-top comedy about some rather serious issues (the future of the elderly and exploitation by governments and military). It's got great animation, loads of personality, goofy comedy, fan-service, and loads of general mayhem the likes of which only anime can provide (a medical bed taking on the personality of the patient's dead wife, turning into a giant robot and running amok through the city in an attempt to take the old man to the beach? :D

The only problem is that the original VHS I saw of this movie back in the day looks BETTER than the DVD. This movie desperately needs a remaster. There's some great detailed art in this film but you'd never know it from the horrendous transfer. This iconic bit of mecha comedy deserves better than this. Definitely buy it...after it finally gets a remaster like Ah My Goddess or Magic Knight Rayearth.",1363564800,,978,4.752941176470588
7857846,5,6303968910,i watched this years ago and thought it was ridiculous and dismissed it as a stupid movie.  but awhile afterwards i realized i shouldn't have taken it seriously and that is why i didn't like it.  it is ridiculous and that is what makes it great.  sometimes a movie like this is perfect to watch after seeing too many serious movies.  it is what it is and i loved it.,1309046400,,366,4.185714285714286

While definitely watchable, there was some combing (artefacts on moving edges) which suggests problems (or just laziness) while digitalizing the movie.

7857848,2,6303968910,"A prototype mechanized bed designed to take care of the elderly morphs into a powerful robot and goes on a rampage in order to take its occupant on one more trip to the beach.  There's a bit of social commentary about Japan's rapidly aging society in the premise; however, a character's comment that it's not right to put the aged in mechanical beds because that just hides the problem neatly sums up everything ""Roujin Z"" has to say on the subject.  The rest of the film is rampaging robots, lowbrow comedy, and widespread destruction, none of it very interesting either visually or dramatically.

Despite the undeniable talent and experience of Japan's animation industry, I continue to be surprised and annoyed that the same big-eyed, narrow-jawed character design is so prevalent.  It seems to be a convention of the genre that fans just accept, but it made me feel that I had already seen ""Roujin Z"" as soon as it began.",1168646400,,925,4.7625
7857849,4,6303968910,"Roujin Z was one of the first anime I ever saw, and if I'm right it's also one of the first brought over to American shores and given the full treatment. It's funny watching this movie ten years later, because Americanized anime back then wasn't treated the same as anime today. Instead of letting the Japanese culture shine through, they force the American way into the scenes. One primary example is where they displace Japanese government and police agencies for our own, that being the Pentagon and FBI. It's a history lesson in anime as well as a fun anime movie from the past era of re-versioned anime.

The story is about an old man who's gotten to the point where he can no longer care fore himself without help, and a young nurse named Haruko has taken it upon herself to care for this man. But, without her knowledge, a family member of the old man has volunteered him to be the guinea pig in the experimentation of a cutting edge bed, made for caring for the old. But the bed is designed too well, and grows a mind of its own, taking on the personality of the old man's late wife. Thus, the bed changes into a giant robot with all intentions of getting the old man to the beach. In its path are government officials and military versions of the bed, but the bed itself has its own help in a group of old hackers and young nurses, as well as Haruko.

The story takes on an Akira-like moment when the machines start to mutate, taking in anything and everything it touches, but it doesn't exactly take away from the anime, even though it's an obvious copy of the cult classic. The gold in this anime is the message it delivers, and that message is how we treat those of a later generation, or the old, to be blunt. And it proves that age is no barrier, nor is it a weakness, but a state of mind.

For anyone seeking to learn what Americanized anime was like ten years ago, or if you're a collector, check this out. Roujin Z is a solid anime very similar to Akira in design, but not in mood; this anime in no way takes itself seriously. It's funny at times, and touching at other times, but never dark or overly violent.",1136851200,2,2127,4.3125
