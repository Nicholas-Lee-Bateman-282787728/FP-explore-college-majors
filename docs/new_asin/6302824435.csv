Winner of the Grand Prix in Cannes. A true artistic feat of his Director Serif Goren. Go for this one.

It is less than amazing this film has not been released on DVD format!",1132704000,2,418,4.942857142857143
517603,5,6302824435,"One word can really sum up this movie - WOW! This is a brilliant film written objectively; it realistically depicts life in Turkey. Yilmaz Guney mastered ""Yol"" and he deserves much due praise for this masterpiece. Tarik Akan, a supreme Turkish actor, displayed the role of ""Seyit"" flawlessly and the remaining four prisoners, which the film closely followed, perfected their characters, instilling much deep feeling into the hearts of the audience. This film is an excellent tool in trying to familiarize oneself about the Turkish-Kurdish lifestyle and the role of the Turkish government. The audience is not subjected to any biases; instead, they are able to view the situation through both lenses - the Kurds and the government. This is honestly one of the best films I have seen, other works pale in comparison.",1081555200,3,814,5.082089552238806
517604,5,6302824435,"This is a beautiful film. The film was directed by Yilmaz Guney when he was in jail. The assistant director Serif Goren shot the film in absence of Guney. There are lots of debates about who deserves the credit. As like any good films, the process of the making a film, is not  just with the cinematography, or editing or script writing, it's more with the vision and how each pieces of  work are integrated together to represent the final vision of the film. Although there are not much of materials to indicate who delivers this final form, I tend to believe that it's Guney's work of art. Even besides the controversy, this film is beautiful creation of art. The films runs parallel with the life of five prisoner, when they are released for one week, a sort of vacation. When these characters came out of the prison, through series of check post, they finally arrives their familiar surroundings which again symbolize them as a victim of cultural repression. It is a personal film, of certain characters who are the victim of repression, political and cultural both. Probably for any aspiring society to be liberated from repression, it is necessary identify the roots of repression which has it roots in cultural blindness and also the political aspiration of the elite class. And they often converge very well. These are just two sides of a coin, which lay down victims on both the side as it rolls on. This beautifully displays the emotion, nave emotions of human aspiration, parallels across different cultures, and their conflicts deeply rooted in the culture. The editing of the film is superb, and that's why I reserve to take the credit away from Guney, who blend the glimpses, moments of different people, different ambience, smoothly, to resembles like a poetry of basic human emotions, their desires and their conflicts. I agree with the other reviewer, that it's not the best documentary of Turkey, but again that's not the point. This is a seriously film, who are interested getting involved with the character, and let aside their judgmental intelligence. This film is something to be seen and feel, and the rationalization comes much later.",1070755200,10,2159,4.880108991825613
517605,3,6302824435,"First,let me clarify this.. The director of this movie is not Yilmaz Guney. It is Serif Goren, who was Guney's assistant in his previous movies.. Guney wrote the script, but it was filmed by Goren in 1981 in  Southeastern Turkey (where I was born) under very difficult conditions  after the military coup . It was then rewarded Palme D'Or in Cannes in  1982, along with Costa Gavras's Missing, both being political films. It was  illegal in Turkey until recently. This is probably what gave it its cult  status in Turkey. So far so good.

I was able to see the movie at a  college show in Istanbul in 1996. I had heard so much about the movie  (""the best Turkish movie ever"", ""a masterpiece"" etc.)  and had great expectations. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met and  I left the theater bored.

The movie starts with a good idea (five  prisoners are given a week's home leave). The prisoners are then faced with  the harsh reality of the traditions. (One is forced to kill his unfaithful  wife by the woman's family, one is forced to marry his sister-in-law since  his brother was killed by the soldiers, etc.) Some directors might have  created a masterpiece from this, but Goren fails. The characters are  shallow and one-dimesional. Goren tries but fails to explore the alienation  of the prisoners from the traditions of the society. After a certain point,  the movie turns into an unpleasant touristic journey in southeastern  Turkey.

""Yol"" is one of those movies much debated for its  politics rather than its artistic value. It shares the same destiny with  Kusturica's Underground(1995). Kusturica was criticized for being  politically incorrect in Underground(accusing Croatians and Slovenians for  supporting Nazis, the only Bosnian in the movie being a gambler and a gun  smuggler, etc.)""Yol"" is praised so much because, I think, it is  politically correct. It portrays Turkey as a miserable and backward  country. I am not saying this is completely untrue,but this is probably why  it was rewarded with Palm D'Or in Cannes. Not because of its artistic  value. ""The Night of the Shooting Stars"" by Taviani Brothers is  much better artistically. But it was only rewarded the Special Jury  Prize.

The view of Turkey in this movie matches the European view of  Turkey at that time, simply ""hell"". As a person who lived in the  region, I don't think this is realistic after all.  Overall, the movie is  not that good. I wish it was shot by a better director.

PS: Yilmaz Guney  was not in prison because of his political thoughts and views at that time,  as one of the reviewers say. He was in prison, simply because he shot a  prosecutor in a restaurant. A fact that does not affect my respect for him,  though. I like his earlier movies better, my favorite one being  ""Agit-Elegy"".

Edit: I've just seen this movie again after almost 10 years. I have to say that now I find my previous review somewhat unjust. It's indeed a political movie, and Guney makes his point. Yes, some of the traditions portrayed in the movie are not common practices in Turkey, however they still exist, albeit marginal.  The acting is amateurish mostly (the intonations are laughable) , but hey, these are non-actors, anyway, and the actors  do a good job. (Tarik Akan -- Seydali--, in particular, who became famous with his charming looks in comedies in early '70s. Hard to tell here.)
But it's the powerful details that makes it a great movie. Blind gypsy kids playing the popular tune of the day ""Sabuha"" on the bus, the posters of Bulent Ersoy, the transsexual singer, next to the posters of Kenan Evren, the head of the military coup (who, by the way, banned Bulent Ersoy from performing), homeless kids smoking. Things that could not have been captured on film by anyone, but Yilmaz Guney himself.",962668800,21,3800,4.794753086419753
517606,3,6302824435,"This is a rare three-star masterpiece; one must consider that the average (in this case even the above average) viewer will not see the art of this epic--only an overlong, grainy old foreign film which is slow and hard to  follow.  (Sad but true)  The late snow-travel scenes are absolutely  surreal:  in a blizzard, passing an ornate, leafless tree, a father carries  his swooning wife while she is beaten by their five year-old son to keep  her awake and alive.  My mother's comment, regardless of cultural reality,  was that the women in this film were nothing but instruments for men's  suffering...that and no one's ever happy.  One leaves with thorough and  all-too-tempting-to-generalize view of Turkey as a war-torn, miserable,  impoverished, and just plain backward country.  It illustrates what happens  when ""family"" is, perhaps, a little TOO important (honor, shame,  etc.).  Considering the circumstances, this is an amazing film, but it's  not one someone would(/could?) watch again and again.  Be prepared to gasp  and feel guilty for being able to ""kick back"" with a movie.",961286400,7,1089,5.149425287356322
517607,5,6302824435,I believe the film to be as the masterpiece of Yilmaz Guney's career and for any person to see. It reflects the problems faced by convicts and ordinary people in the region of South-Eastern Turkey like most of Yilmaz  Guneys films do. The film was awarded the Palme D'Or at the Cannes film  festival  in 1982. Yilmaz Guney wrote the script and smuggled it out when  he himself was in prison for his Political thoughts and views. So he had a  insight into the lifes of these people. The film is of excellent Quality  and truely reflects the hardship faced by similar people of the time and  place. Serif Goren directed the film and Yilmaz Guney later fleed prison to  seek Asylum in France where he later died. His work is still recognised  today and he is seen as the greatest Turkish/Kurdish director and  scripwriter.,953596800,6,819,4.586206896551724

My father had us watch dense and deep movies, such as Tarkovsky's films, etc. This movie was the most touching of all movies I have ever seen.

7831984,4,6302824435,"Yol is the story of five prisoners who are released under condition for a week and come back home to visit their relatives, friends in their villages. Most of the movie turns around the trip home back of two Kurdish guys, one of them will decide not to come back to the prison and join the Kurdish revolutionary army. When arriving home, another of the prisoners finds out that his wife has been sentenced to live together with pigs, as she was found guilty of adultery (or even prostitution) by the guy's relatives. He is asked to kill hner, but he decides to place his trust in God. So, man, wife and their son leaves the village walking to a high pass up on the mountains, the woman clothed only in her light wedding dress. This is the most moving section of the film. We face with a number of different emotions and situations in Turkey (""a prison holding 45 milion people both inside and outside"") of the 1970s. The movie was finished by followers of the director (Yilmaz Guney), who himself was able to escape from a Turkish prison and reach Europe, but he died before the movie was finished. He won a prize in Cannes Festival. I recommend it strongly.",1244937600,10,1158,4.466981132075472
7831985,4,6302824435,"When I saw this movie on VHS many years ago (13 years ago!) as a teenager about to enter college it was absolutely moving and I watched it several times over a couple years.  The movie follows 5 prisoners on a short furlough who are released to their homes for a week.  They go in separate directions and have very different experiences -- none of which are particularly happy but each story is rendered beautifully.

As mentioned in the reviews on the VHS thread (someone should combine the two) you should note that the film was created by the director in prison and filmed primarily by his assistants.  Aside from authorship issues, this may clue you in to the fact that this is not be a particularly kind mirror on Turkish society, and I am not Turkish so I do not dare attest to the authenticity.  But I can say that as an Asian kid who grew up in America, this was an incredibly moving and emotional film.

I have to admit that in this past decade I have now regressed in my movie preferences and that I generally only watch Hollywood blockbusters, so the odds are I may not watch this movie anytime soon.  But for those who aren't addicted to fast paced flicks(unlike me nowadays) and watch movies to feel (and not just feel happy at the end) this movie is well worth checking out.",1241481600,6,1288,4.409282700421941
7831986,1,6302824435,"Complete rubbish from start to finish, the hand wringing liberals of course will love it.  Something to discuss over a glass of wine when the conversation starts to die down and you cant find a guardian newspaper or a Robert Fisk article to discuss.

The film centres around several men on short release from prison who all journey home to visit families with various results.  One man to the south east where he falls in love with a local woman but ends up having to marry his sister in law after his brother is killed smuggling.  When the brothers body is brought back its shown as though these people are some kind of local heros fighting against the 'evil army' opressing them.

Now someone with little knowledge of Turkey or Islam may not notice this but in one scene we have this man courting the lady he has fallen in love with, with her 2 female relatives all in black veils following behind.  The man instructs her how she will 'behave' once they are married and her response of course is to flutter her eyes and remark how well he speaks.  Now aside from the shear nonsense of this scene (I'm sure it went down well with the middle class hand wringers in whatever country this pile of rubbish won an award, oh how it confirmed how backward those 'dreadful dark skinned folk are' how they must be 'civilized' and their opressed women folk 'liberated')

Then nonsene continues; The same man who it seems is courting the girl from a burqa clad family then sits and drink raki (alcohol) with his mates then goes and sleeps with a couple of prostitutes!  Now anyone with even the most basic knowledge of Turkey knows only the most ulta religious in the country wear burqa (usually the Naqshbandis) and there wouldnt be a chance in hell of them even contemplating giving their daughter in marriage to some drunk who sleeps around at the local brothel.

Next we have noble hero no 2 a bank robber no less who ran off and left his mates to die.  Oh how his family curse him ""You have no honour"" (Some might say being a bank robber in the first place he has no honour) how they deny him his wife and family.  Anyway, they run off regarless, biology takes over and they go for a quickie in the foulest toilet on a train.  Sadly our romeo and juliet are discovered by a mob (who acording to the translator who seems to think serifsiz means gavur as he translates this (wrongly) to mean 'infidel')

No 3 goes off to the snow capped mountains to find his missus chained up in the shed after being found doing the rounds in a local brothel by her family (who are a very religious sort, of course) They instruct him to kill her off and even pray for him to have the strength to do the job!

No doubt this pointless rubbish would win awards.  It covers just about every single stereotype we in the west love so much.  Problem is, you would have to be insane to even consider this even a half decent film.  The acting is awful, the subtitiles are incorrect, playing a bit of Turkish folk music and having some unshaven local looking into the camera does not make a film worth watching.  This is utter rubbish from start to finish.

Avoid at all costs!",1187740800,,3144,4.406574394463668
