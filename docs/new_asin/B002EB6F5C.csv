The video/audio quality will be less than half of what it should be, and it is very likely that the subtitles will be badly translated from Chinese (and therefore the names and all puns will be ruined, in addition to the badly broken English).
This was released to the US in only two forms... a single amaray case with two discs, and two separate amaray cases.

Bootlegs like this shouldn't be allowed on the site, unless they are clearly marked as such, and legally, I'm not even certain if they should be allowed at all.

As far as the program content, I considered this to be a sub-par ecchi anime.  The only draw being the risque content, which did not thrill me in the slightest.",1373241600,,811,4.386666666666667
