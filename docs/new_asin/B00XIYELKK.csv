8716036,5,B00XIYELKK,"Amazing from start to finish. I couldn't recommend it more. I love this show, its cast, its staff, its writer, its director-- everyone, down to the very last person!

This is most definitely a Japanese televised masterpiece. The character development is so clear and subtle. You can really feel proud as you watch Saburo grow from a frightened (and horny) teenage boy into a man (not to mention a really good daimyo). I was super touched as Tsune-chan also grew alongside them and stuck with him through thick and thin (kind of, but I'm not nickpicking). Also, Kaicho was insanely good. Her tsundere tendencies seem so relevent to the time period, when the weak die, people try anything to at least look strong.

Heinously underrated in the West. I want to recommend it to everyone!",1479168000,,782,4.785185185185185
8716037,5,B00XIYELKK,The subtitles are good from start to finish. I like the actor Shun Oguri (I 1st saw him in another drama) and the humor of the shows. This isn't a comedy  but it dose have some fun sense. It also has some death sense and some sad sense. I can't wait til the next part of the drama comes out. If I understand right (and I COULD BE WRONG - i'm not all knowing) the second part I speak of was made or put out 1(one) or 2(two) years after this one. Even if you don't see the second one this one is worth seeing.,1479168000,,507,3.8285714285714287
8716038,5,B00XIYELKK,"Wonderful story--great acting. It isn't a comedy as it is listed--there is humor, but it is has more drama than laughs. Very well done.",1477785600,,135,4.666666666666667
