The story begins at a mansion at night. A millionaire called a psychiatrist because he's worried about his son: ""he's a softie"". ""The boy seems to have an excellent mind."" The next scene shows a wrestling match. The ""Masked Marvel"" fights the ""Russian Lion"". [How does this compare to modern shows?] The psychiatrist recommends a change of environment. [Is there a lack of communication here?] His father will send Grant to Timberlake to get him out of the office and get contact with life. Grant is warned. A speaker complains about a lack of pensions for lumberjacks. Free speech in America? ""Not for you."" Grant can get a working outfit at the company store, they will ""put it on his ticket"". Somebody left an open switch on the railroad and a couple of log cars went over the rails into a ditch. We learn who is behind this sabotage. We see trees falling. ""Timber."" Grant chops away. Nick explains ""pensions"", payment to unemployed men. ""Think of your future.""

Everybody goes to the Saturday night dances. Grant calls Peggy and asks to drop in. She goes along with this gag. Sanger arrives to talk to Mr. O'Shea. Somebody bought up his notes at the bank! We see how logs are rounded up and dropped in the river for transportation. Mr. Morton offers some men to the O'Shea company. (Is there a scheme here?) The Saturday night dance goes on. Grant knows how to solve a conflict when he is outnumbered, and who was behind this. A steam engine pulls a train of timber cars. After the air brake loosened the cars pick up speed downhill until they derail around a sharp bend! Sanger is notified, and tells Peggy. Peggy finds Grant and tells him off! Sanger tells Grant to keep off the O'Shea property, and Grant replies. Grant sends and receives telegrams, they tell about a second set of books. Will Grant pull a trick on Sanger? [Taken from ""The Front Page"".] ""I wonder how it got there?"" Grant's father arrives in town to free Morton. There is a funny scene at the police station. The accusations and counter-accusations bring out the hidden facts and result in jailing the guilty. There will be a happy ending for Peggy and Grant.

This drama takes place in an Oregon timber ranch, a small business that is a rival to a big corporation's timber ranch. It's a drama with comedy, better than ""Hollywood Cowboy"". It notes the problem of using mercenaries to run a business when there is no oversight from upper management. ""Trust, but verify."" Basically these rural timber camps are a very small village. There were other company towns across the nation since the Civil War era.",1292457600,,2610,4.6695652173913045
8264441,4,B00170ID3I,"RKO Radio Pictures presents ""PARK AVENUE LOGGER"" (16 March 1937) (67 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) --- George O'Brien was an American actor, popular during the silent film era and into the talkie era of the 1930s, best known today as the lead actor in F. W. Murnau's 1927 film Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans --- American leading man of classic silent films who became a different kind of star in B-Western talkies --- The son of a policeman who later became police chief of San Francisco and then California Director of Penology, O'Brien was raised around police stables and quickly became adept at horsemanship --- He was a star athlete in school and intended to study medicine, but with the advent of World War I, he joined the Navy and volunteered to serve as a stretcher-bearer with the Marines.

Following his discharge, a chance encounter with Tom Mix led to a job as camera assistant with Mix's production company --- O'Brien takes on small jobs as a prop man, extra, stunt man, and finally bit player --- John Ford spotted the husky young man and cast him in the lead role of his early Western The Iron Horse (1924) --- He continued to work for Ford and became a popular leading man for a number of top-flight directors --- With the coming of sound, he moved almost exclusively into Westerns and became a popular star of low-budget oaters --- George remained popular until sound came along --- By that time, his popularity was sliding, but he did make the transition to sound --- With his rugged looks and physical size, he was soon a Western Cowboy Star --- He was in some of the best stories ever written, Riders of the Purple Sage (1931),

George O'Brien became a popular star of Westerns and rarely took parts outside of the Western film genre --- Throughout the 1930s, O'Brien was a consistent Top Ten box-office draw appearing in scores of Westerns, often atop his horse named Mike.

David Howard - Director
Bruce Hutchison -  story from ""The Saturday Evening Post""
Daniel Jarrett - Screenwriter
