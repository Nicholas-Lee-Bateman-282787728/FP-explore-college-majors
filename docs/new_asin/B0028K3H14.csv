8356347,5,B0028K3H14,I really enjoyed this documentary. I think it's a good start for diving into the world of hijras and understanding their role in India culture and the issues facing them.,1441756800,,170,4.7
8356348,5,B0028K3H14,"This documentary may only be 1/2 hour long, but it is historically and emotionally full of strong personal testimony and information. It's focus is on a yearly festival where for a few, short happy days, hijra's (also known as other names and in various categories) are allowed to freely celebrate their sexuality. It's honesty is in parts sad (in many parts of Eastern India, homosexuality is a crime, punishable by 10 years in prison), but it is in the end, triumphant, as they have found a loving and strong and accepted place with people of the same mind and beliefs. Very highly recommended.",1400025600,,596,4.796116504854369
8356349,4,B0028K3H14,"This documentary is one of the very few available on the often-silenced subject of the transgendered hijra devotees of India and is excellent for use in classes on gender, sexuality, and religion. My only complaint is that it is too brief, but I still recommend it highly.  Blackthorn Krause, CA",1266796800,,295,4.9
