2763382,4,B000NA28HK,"This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. This is a good erotic
thriller import from Australia. Tom Long plays a male dancer kidnapped and
used for sexual purposes by three women. They dump him after having their way
with him and he spends the rest of the film trying to find them. The film is
well acted but does have the drawback in that nothing is resolved by the film's
end.",1290384000,4,391,4.226666666666667
2763383,1,B000NA28HK,Poorly written and amateurishly directed. It wasn't as good as a thrown-together t.v. movie. Appears actors capable of better performance if given the chance.,1255305600,,158,5.625
2763384,3,B000NA28HK,"Strange introspective study, full of Bergman references. Australian dancer goes missing for 12 days then returns, disturbed. Films that rely heavily on imagery are rarely very successful and this is no exception, though it is refreshing to see a new director who is not afraid to try a new approach. Tom Long is exceptional as the lead and the dance sequences are both very impressive and perturbing. The plot is too diffuse and fantasy-laden, however, to make a real impression. Has been tagged as a gay movie, which is absurd, though there is a very strong and at times expicit sexual element. Possible interpretation: thoughts of death destroy sexual desire ? Curiosity value.",1223856000,2,679,5.017699115044247

2763386,3,B000NA28HK,"As my Review Title would suggest, I'm torn between the comments in the reviews that currently exist.

The ""Dangerous Delusions"" review points out, this story is based around the abduction of a male dancer by three hooded/masked women. Yes, he ""becomes a live sexual toy gratifying three women"", however, the gratification is against his will and any attempt to deny their sexual demands are met with the threat of hobbling his ankles. And, as the story unfolds, we find that they also abducted this man in particular because they found his dancing to be beautiful, hence, they also 'request' that he puts on a dance performance for them. What happens next, is accurately reviewed in the second paragraph of ""Dangerous Delusions"".

The ""Censorship"" review is 100% correct when it comes down to, exactly that, the censorship of a supposed NR (Not Rated/Unrated) DVD title. I too was somewhat sold on this rating. Only to discover that it was horribly censored when it came to human genitalia scenes in this movie.

Whether this has anything to do with the Region 8 Code (International venues such as aircraft, cruise ships, etc.), I don't know? Certainly, I do caution anyone who wants to purchase this product based on the somewhat false ""Product Details"" which stated the ""Rating"" as being ""Unrated"".

It may be UNRATED but it certainly is heavily CENSORED!!!

As for my rating, I would have given this DVD a 4/5 stars based on the content evaluation of this title. The misleading product details deserves a 1/5 star rating because it did ruin the flow of the content. Overall, I had to meet somewhere in between, rating this 3/5.

2763387,1,B000NA28HK,"I rented this DVD from Netflix, and had high hopes for it.  It was rated NR and would contain graphic sex scenes ala Shortbus and 9 Songs, however I was horrified to see this little grey circle censoring any naughty stuff.  This completely ruined the viewing experience for me, and I would caution anyone renting or purchasing this DVD to make sure they get an uncensored copy.",1192752000,22,377,4.611940298507463
2763388,4,B000NA28HK,"In the broad daylight, in a heart of the City of Melbourne, Australia, a male dancer had been abducted to become a live sexual toy gratifying three women.

Very lucky to stay alive (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boy-Meets-Girl-Region-2/dp/B000065UGS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boy Meets Girl [Region 2</a>], for instance), he engages in a rampage of sex with strangers, trying to find out mysterious she-rapists by body-marks noticed on face-covered sexual predators, and this paranoic investigating leads to pitiful results.

Rather philosophical than entertaining movie with some homoerotic trend, attracting to Australia a particular segment of hoping tourists, perhaps.",1189468800,5,722,6.836956521739131

2763392,4,B000NA28HK,"A dark, sensual film that features an unusual spin upon the topic of rape, the protagonist finds himself in a position that some might find enviable, but the main thrust of the movie is less about the sexual dominion of the lovely women who take control of him than it is about the ensuing psychological impact upon the man's psyche and the distinctly different manner in which society reacts to the concept of a man in that position.  I'd recommend it...",1411689600,4,455,4.617283950617284
2763393,4,B000NA28HK,"I enjoy erotic books. This story was different and fit my critic for this genre. It is well written and really a different theme.

2763395,5,B000NA28HK,"The Book of Revelation was strongly graphic which could bother some people.  I, however, thought it was very well acted and the premise was unique and interesting.  It held one's attention throughout, leaving the viewer wondering what he/she would have done if something similar had occurred to him or her personally, thus, thought provoking.  Tom Long, the principal actor, is a brave soul for taking on this unique role, and he was/is superb in it.",1367280000,2,450,4.973333333333334
2763396,3,B000NA28HK,"the movie was very well acted. extremely interesting concept for a movie. but it was billed as horror, and it really wasn't. more of a psychological thriller/drama. what happens to the main character is certainly awful and in many ways a taboo subject, it plays very slowly and with no real climax to the plot. i truly came to like the main character and two of the supporting actors as well and cared about what happened to them. i just feel it fell short in the end, and being a real horror buff, also fell short in the horror aspect.",1365120000,,536,4.37
2763397,3,B000NA28HK,This story did not seem to hold my  attention. I did not finish the complete movie. Just seemed to be an average run of the mill story in my opinion.,1358899200,,149,3.966666666666667
2763398,3,B000NA28HK,"SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?  A guy gets kidnapped by three beautiful women who give him head and force sexual acts on him... I mean, am I the only one who has no problem with this?  Now I must say the acting is superb (except for the three women.  It must be difficult to find hot girls who can act and show their twats) but the main character should be thrilled with this.  It's not like he was an evangelical, or something. He wasn't gay either, that we know of.  I think they were trying to talk about societies double standards, but it just doesn't work. Men crave bush, and we're happy to have it, whenever or wherever we can get it. An example of why I think this is about societies double standards is when the main character goes to the police station and tries to tell the authorities about what happened and they laugh at him. I would have laughed too. ""Um these three beautiful women kidnapped me and forced sexual acts on me without my consent.""  Maybe they were tying to make men understand what women go through in the same type of situation. Whatever the reason, it didn't work. A better way to talk about societies double standards would be to have a movie about a wife that beats her husband. I mean, my wife beats me all the time, but am I going to tell anyone? S*** no. If they made a movie about it, however, I'd be cheering for the guy throughout the whole movie.  They can hit us, but we can't hit them, now 'there's' an interesting movie for reverse double standards if I've ever heard of one. It is worth watching though for the great acting and cool bush.",1345075200,7,1575,4.300675675675675
