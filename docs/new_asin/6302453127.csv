463571,4,6302453127,"MGM musicals employed the best and brightest of actors, dancers, singers (sometimes, luckily, all three!), songwriters, and other people involved in the famed Freed Unit. When certain actors or actresses were employed, you were certain of a particular style of film or plot, and while this created some of the film musical's most enduring classics, it could also hamper the plot and its cast. The latter happens in ""Duchess of Idaho"", where the film's amazing leads, Esther Williams and Van Johnson, are forced to fit what their audiences expected of them. Granted, I really enjoyed the film, but once I realized the script had to tack on swimming sequences for Williams, and bloated an already charming plot with the requisite ""musical"" numbers, I found my enthusiasm a bit dampened. Williams and co-star Paula Raymond (who reminded me very much of Gene Tierney) are roommates and ex-service women. Raymond's character, Ellen Hallit, is the timid secretary of playboy railroad tycoon Douglas Morrison (the underrated and under-used John Lund). He blithely uses her as a shield against designing women, ignorant of the fact that she is in love with him. Williams plays Christine Duncan, who has a vague job as a synchronized swimmer in Chicago, who decides to win Morrison for her roommate and friend by pursuing Morrison on a trip to Sun Valley, Idaho, just certain he will once more call for Ellen to pretend to be his fiancee and promptly fall in love with her.

On the train, Williams stumbles into Johnson, who plays bandleader Dick Layne to songstress Connie Haines (playing a singer named Peggy Elliot) and a very 40s big band. They ""meet cute"" during a smooth musical interlude--the highlight is the obscure quartet The Jubilaires--when Williams gets a cinder in her eye and accidentally wanders in Johnson's compartment. The pair are instantly smitten, though with the requisite clash of personalities, but Williams is committed to vamping playboy Morrison, who, oddly enough, is convinced he is a marvelous cook (his valet/butler is thoroughly unimpressed). The mix-up amongst the three is somewhat predictable, though the script is witty and sophisticated, and the cast is superb. The musical elements were rather odd, what with Lena Horne making an appearance and Eleanor Powell doing a tap in her last film role, as well as the scenes of Johnson, Haines, and the big band performing a few ditties. Red Skelton makes a cameo during a scene which explains the name of the film, and while everything is entertaining and funny, you can't help but feel the screenwriters grafted a sort of musical/comedy revue into a frothy romantic comedy. The plot returns to its romantic comedy roots with the appearance of Ellen, who managed to make Mr. Morrison /see/ her all on her own, and wants to nip Christine's pursuit of Morrison in the bud. There is a small mix-up worthy of the best screwball comedies of the 30s and early 40s, and the denouement is funny and interesting in light of our assumptions regarding gender roles in the post-WWII era.

Despite my caveats, I highly recommend the Duchess of Idaho, because MGM and the Freed Unit manage to make all of these elements work and work very well.",1301875200,3,3204,4.975746268656716
463572,5,6302453127,Need I say more??  This great lady isn't getting her just reward because so many folks cant see her talent displayed the way it should be!!! DVD is the only way movies are seen in 2007!! VHS has been dead for years !!!,1189123200,,218,4.069767441860465

Including Mel Torme, Lena Horne, Red Skelton, but best of all: Eleanor Powell dances! After been retires from the screen for over three years. She comes back, and proves that she is still the queen of tap!!

The movie begins with Esther's roomate. Who is a secretary to the man she is in love with. But he doesn't care 2 straws about her. To him the only thing she is good for, is taking notes, and getting rid of girls.

That is until Esther contrives a plot to get them together. Van Johnson is also in this, and is wonderful! See it!",1103414400,12,677,4.28125

463833,3,6302453127,"Pity Ellen Hallet, lovelorn secretary to her playboy boss, Douglas Morrissen Jr. (John Lund). Ellen (Paula Raymond) is quite lovely, except her looks are undermined by her mousiness. She's been carrying a torch for Mr. Morrissen for a while now, but he's such an oblivious bloke. In fact he frequently has her posing as his fiance to cool off his gold-digging dates. In all likelihood, long-suffering Ellen Hallet would've kept pining, stuck in inertia.

Luckily, she's got a roommate. Christine Duncan (Esther Williams) is the star performer in a popular nightclub aquatic show called Melody in Swimtime. Chris, glamourous and self-assured, is the polar opposite of Ellen. And she's finally had enough of Ellen's unrequited mooning. She decides to brush up on her matchmaking skills.

1950's THE DUCHESS OF IDAHO features one of the four times that Esther Williams and Van Johnson were paired up onscreen, and that's one of the two primary reasons to check out this otherwise unremarkable MGM musical comedy. The other distinguishing element is the abundance of star cameos. The story opens in Chicago but soon shifts to Idaho, to the Sun Valley resort. It's in Sun Valley that Chris lays out her trap as she sets out to capture the interest of Ellen's womanizing boss. But she didn't expect to also hook in a bandleader on the make (Van Johnson).

A better than average 3 out of 5 stars for THE DUCHESS OF IDAHO, this title referring to a tongue-in-cheek honorific awarded to Chris upon her winning a (don't drop the) potato dance contest. As Esther Williams' career went, she became increasingly vexed with the sameness and banality of the plots of her films. But her films were popular, partly because the audience knew what to expect from an Esther Williams starrer. So the mismatched lovers storyline covers familiar territory, made tolerable by Williams' gorgeous appeal and Johnson's everyman likability. On the other hand, the scenes between Williams and Lund seemed to go on and on.

This time out, Hollywood's favorite mermaid strays a bit from her niche as she only has two aquatic numbers (the scene where she dunks Johnson in the pool doesn't count). Instead, she spends most of the time out of the water, playing John Lund and Van Johnson against each other. Esther Williams' character's conniving rivals that of Lucille Ball in the sense that it was only a matter of time before things got out of control. Are you surprised that her meek roommate turns out to be the more level-headed girl?

Sparking up interest are the star appearances in Sun Valley. Lena Horne sings ""Baby, Come Out of the Clouds."" Eleanor Powell comes out of retirement to perform a dizzying boogie-woogie tap-dance number. An unbilled Red Skelton steps in for a moment. Crooner Mel Torm has a bit part as a bellhop and even sings ""Warm Hands, Cold Heart,"" except that number got clipped from the final cut. Van Johnson himself gets to (awkwardly) belt out ""You Can't Do Wrong Doin' Right."" Unlike Esther Williams, he maybe should've stayed in his niche.",1367193600,2,3041,4.920077972709552
463834,4,6302453127,"I really enjoyed this movie.  It has some really swinging songs, and many great moments with Esther Williams, Van Johnson, John Lund, and Lena Horne.  The film was also Eleanor Powell's last movie appearance as a dancer before her retirement.  Ellie made one TV appearance with Danny Thomas in 1952, then became a minister in the Unity Church and hosted their TV show.  After her divorce from Glenn Ford, she made a comeback in the late '50s and early '60s as a nightclub and TV performer, before disappearing again until 1981, when she made her last public appearance at the American Film Institute tribute to Fred Astaire, just prior to her death.

Unusually for a Warner Archives rerelease, this DVD has bonus songs by Lena Horne and Mel Torm, as well as the usual theatrical trailer.  Definitely worth owning, and not just for Ellie's dance.

7825799,4,6302453127,"Nice 1950 Esther Williams film. Not my favorite Golden Age film or even my favorite Esther film though, my favorites of hers being ""Bathing beauty"",  "" This time for keeps"", ""Easy to love"", and ""Thrill of a romance"". My favorite water ballets of hers are in ""Bathing beauty"" and ""This time for keeps"".
  Here in ""Duchess of Idaho"", Esther gets tangled up, yet again with Van Johnson, also not my favorite Golden Age star, but he's OK, he's still better than many more modern celebs. Van's competition is an egocentric cook who is very fond of the idea of cooking for Esther, first omelettes in his own private car on the train, and then later at his Villa, roast duck, sides and salads (his servant doesn't like the salad though and throws it out and remakes it himself).
  There's a real old time Chicago blues theme in this film with the first part in Chicago and the second part on a train in a car with a blues band playing several tunes with a talented female singer and then a blues trio. In walks Esther, Van is smitten (again).  Then the film takes us to Idaho (hence film name) and Esther being tossed around between Van and the smarmy cook (both are redheads, probably deliberately, the cook sports a mustache Van doesn't have). I liked the scenes at dinner with Van's blues band playing. There are other quirky moments too, but other moments that were missing something, many of them scenes between Esther and Van and Esther and the cook. There is an OK (but not fabulous) part at a dance where the dancers including Esther and Van must dance holding up an orange with their heads together. The whole section takes place at an Idaho ski lodge, I kinda like films taking place at a nice exquisite resort somewhere just like in ""Thrill of a romance"", which was better than this one.
  I sort of liked Van's blues band playing several different catchy tunes, one being like a brotherhood deacon number (one line being ""beakin, deacon"") named ""You can't do wrong doin right"". I noticed two men in the band with these prominent looking horned rim glasses, one of them, a tall guy with a mustache and glasses who looks uncannily like a guy I used to work with, the other a short guy in glasses (who sings a line ""sorry, feelin down"").
  One of my favorite moments was a comeback from the great beautiful Eleanor Powell, who is in this film using her real name. She dances to the same blues tunes that she danced to in "" Broadway melody 40"" with Fred Astaire. She did look a bit older here from her great earlier films such as ""Broadway melody 36"", ""38"",  and ""40"",  ""Rosalie"", and ""Born to dance"".  What I found most sad was that Eleanor didn't do any of her fabulous high kicks here that were so amazing in her earlier films. I guess with her being older here, her beginning to age joints and flexibility made those kicks too hard for her to do anymore. However, her taps and rythmn were still fabulous, she didn't lose her touch on them at all. Aside from the kicks, Eleanor still had it. She still looked beautiful too.",1512172800,,3027,4.4818181818181815
