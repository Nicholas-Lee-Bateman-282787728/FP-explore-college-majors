477795,3,6302548411,"Magazine editor Linda Gilman and her old flame Carey Jackson go to Indiana to do their featured article for the month of June and amusing complications ensue. This little flick is interesting in that it gave Bette a break from her usual tragedies and histrionics, however JUNE BRIDE is no great shakes, it's easy to take and the stars make it watchable entertainment. While viewing this, one couldn't guess that either Davis or Montgomery had much stature in the movies! The ""new look"" of 1948 doesn't particularly suit Davis, and after having a child the year before at 39, she looks every day of her 40 years. The part of Boo is played Betty Lynn who was Barney's girlfriend Thelma Lou on the ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW. She and Davis became life-long friends in real life. Davis later wrote that she couldn't stand Montgomery for his political beliefs and conceited personality. Debbie Reynolds has a bit as one of Boo's school chums. Mary Wickes and Fay Bainter do okay in this slightly stale little flick.",944179200,,1002,4.764367816091954

477850,4,6302548411,"I have waited literally for years for this to be available in video at this price.  Even my husband, who isn't that fond of old movies, really liked it.  I loved seeing the old victorian house, so wish it had been in color.  I love seeing movies set in old-fashioned houses, with old fashioned kitchens, etc.  and it was a cute story line.",1455494400,,339,4.333333333333333
477851,3,6302548411,Not one of Bette Davis' better efforts but not awful.  We aren't used to seeing her TRY to be comedic.  Rosalind Russell could have made this work.,1453852800,,147,4.407407407407407

477853,4,6302548411,This is a charming and quite funny with Bette Davis up against the stylish Robert Montgomery.  Fay Bainter and Mary Wilkes are there for back up even though neither one of the leads needs it.  A great Sunday afternoon flick.,1448409600,,224,4.575
477854,3,6302548411,I love Bette Davis films and I did enjoy this one. Its not her best role but its certainly isn't her worst. Sometimes I think a movie just isn't directed in the way the writer really had it.,1447804800,,190,4.026315789473684

477856,5,6302548411,"I had seen this once on television over 20 years ago and have waited for it to appear on DVD - it did not disappoint!  Davis should have done more light comedies; she had a real gift.  Didn't know much about Robert Montgomery, but I like him in this.  And there's Mary Wicks - they always worked well together.  The pace of the movie, the snappy dialogue, all great, and all the casting, too!  AND this is a great quality print!  Very satisfied!",1446681600,,445,4.301204819277109
477857,3,6302548411,"Bette's a magazine editor who is all business.  Robert is back from the war and wants to rekindle career and an old romance.  They re-unite and converge on an Indiana family and their house for a ""makeover"" wedding magazine shoot.  This was a comeback of sorts for Bette Davis, and it is expertly put together and supporting players are all sharp and funny.  The exception is Academy winner Fay Bainter, who is wasted as Davis' assistant, all wistfulness and muted regret as she thinks about the bride she never got to be.  On the other hand, the younger players are very good.  Davis had two comedies under her belt with this one, the first being ""The Bride Came COD,"" a few years earlier.  I think the trouble with both of these films was that by the time she made them, Bette was just too much ""America's Greatest Actress"" to play comedy.  It's a pity, since script and direction were there to offer her the support that would have given her a sophisticated comedy.  See the film, if for nothing else the line ""We're here to make this McKinley stinker into a Truman modern,"" pertaining to a turn of the century president and the newest president, elected that year.  Everyone in the country thought his rival Thomas Dewey would be voted in, and so the scene had to be re-shot, and it appears in edited sequence as a result.  As well, the Mary Wickes comedic turn regarding""Mrs. Brinker's bust"" is very funny.",1442880000,,1411,4.581673306772909
477858,5,6302548411,love this have been waiting for the dvd for about 8 years. It is a romantic comedy but more importantly it is a view of the change of aesthetic from Victorian (McKinley stinker) to modern transitional and attitudes towards postwar conservatism and the role of women in the us society. It kinda makes me a little uncomfortable to watch Bette in the last scene agreeing with a head bob and a suitcase in hand....but... ugh what we do for love.,1442448000,,441,4.525
477913,5,6302548411,"I've loved this film for a long time and was very glad to finally obtain it on DVD.
Bette Davis & Robert Montgomery make a fine pair. A sophisticated couple (for the time) of former lovers reunited, with Bette as Montgomery's hard-nosed employer. The usually merry mix-ups end with Bette renouncing her female equality to follow Montgomery dutifully around the globe in the end. Sounds a bit dated & likely is, but wonderful fun & wonderfully done.",1441584000,,448,4.8311688311688314

477917,5,6302548411,"June Bride is a very comical movie in itself. I feel it is due to Robert Montgomery's brilliant comic delivery. Bette Davis comic delivery was good as well but more subdued. The story was good and the supporting players were good also. I thought that Robert Montgomery was hysterical when he walked out the front door in a drunken state, past people standing on the front porch and fell flat on his face into the snow. The quality of the disc was good as my blu-ray player had no problems with the playback.  I highly recommend this title.",1436054400,2,539,4.5

477943,4,6302548411,"Witty dialogue, a fantastic supporting cast, and Bette Davis and Robert Montgomery spitting fire at each other, make ""June Bride"" a hilarious spoof of women's magazines. The art direction creates a great ""McKinley Stinker"" and wonderful midwest winter setting. Mary Wickes is terrific as a rum-guzzling food editor whose comments send Tom Tully looking for his wife's ""bust."" A great light comedy, well worth watching.

Although some production notes reflect tension between liberal Davis and conservative Montgomery, their political differences work to the viewer's advantage as the two have great chemistry together. Their comedic timing is remarkable. The film shows what happens when two old showmen get together with a great script and set the celluloid on fire.",1302134400,3,767,5.5
477944,3,6302548411,"""June Bride"" was made in 1948 and stars Bette Davis and Robert Montgomery.  They play two reporters that work for a Women's Magazine, and were romantically involved in the past.  Carey Jackson (Montgomery) just returned form Vienna to learn that his job has ended and is offered a job with Home Life Magazine Editor Linda Gilman (Bette Davis) whome he once almost married.l  Linda is not too happy because he basically dumped her three years earlier, but will work with him if it is strictly professional.

The two of them, plus her staff head for the Brinker home in Crestville, Indiana to prepare a story about the eldest daughter, Jeanne's wedding.  This is for the June issue of the magazine.  Carey must write a simple story about the young couple but he wants another interesting angle.  He finds that Jeanne's younger sister has always been in love with the groom to be, Bud Mitchell.  The plot thickens as Jeanne's former beau returns home for the wedding.

Another twist is that the story must be done in March for the June issue of the magazine.

This is a light romantic comedy that shows how the cynical journalists rediscover each other, their love and answers to the working situation.",1276128000,,1199,4.748792270531401
477945,5,6302548411,This is a good little movie. Cute story line. Good for Bette Davis fans,1124150400,,71,4.142857142857143
477946,5,6302548411,"Not an important picture per se, but a pleasurable one.  Davis and Montgomery can do it all, and their acting in these ridiculous roles is outstanding.  All of their years of training and perfecting their screen timing pay off here, as with effortless elegance and wit they parry back and forth the bright lines handed them by the screenwriting team.  It's a pyrotechnic display of sparks and lightning, particularly at the opening scenes, when Montgomery attempts to seduce Davis in her own apartment.  When the ""HOME LIFE"" crew arrives in Indiana it's almost as if a different movie was starting, less Noel Coward than Ma Kettle.

Isn't that Barbara Bates playing the putative June Bride--the one who plays Phoebe at the end of ALL ABOUT EVE?  It's chilling to see her here acting all phony with Bette Davis.  She's supposed to be a down home girl, and she proves it with a strange Southern accent as though she'd been brought up in Mississippi instead of Indiana.  Her younger sister, ""Boo,"" is the real heart of the picture and as played by Betty Lynn she's not as adorable as she's supposed to be.  Miss Lynn was much better as Loretta Young's daughter in MOTHER WAS A FRESHMAN, where the camera could really take a long look at the hard edges behind her round eager face.  In contrast, Mary Wickes, so often a hapless clown in the movies, actually looks pretty nifty, even sexy, in her modified ""New Look"" sophisticated clothes.  Fay Bainter, playing Paula, goes through the whole picture apparently believing she is the main character in the film, but she's tremendously warm and loveable.

And what happened to Raymond Roe, who plays ""Bud,"" the young groom?  He's like a cross between Farley Granger and Darryl Hickman, but blond.  He had interesting parts in STRANGE BARGAIN and DEAR WIFE, but this is his biggest part by far (that I know of).  By the time 1950 rolled around his career was all but over.  Why?  One of the great Hollywood mysteries is why some actors seem to have been given contracts, billing, the ""buildup"" and maybe they were let go for some reason, but today they look great.  Raymond Roe should have been a big, big star!",1115769600,2,2152,4.693333333333333
477947,4,6302548411,"This is a delightful, breezy, romantic comedy. Bette Davis plays the part of Linda GIlman, a sophisticated and successful magazine editor. Robert Montgomery plays the part of her love interest, Carey Jackson, a foreign correspondent out of a job, who has been assigned to work with her. Having previously been romantically involved, they must now work together.
They travel to Indiana with their entourage where they will do a story on a June bride, having picked a middle class, average, small town family upon which to focus. While there, they get involved in the family's affairs, with a few delightful, though predictable, twists and turns. While getting to know the family, they make some personal discoveries about their own lives. It seems that embers of their own long ago romance, have merely laid dormant. With the flames being fanned, it looks like there may be more than one June bride.
Bette Davis is very soignee as Ms. Gilman, and Robert Montgomery provides a light hearted touch as the cavalier Mr. Jackson. Both contribute some comedic deftness, as does the supporting cast, to make this an entertaining film. The only wrong note struck during the entire film is in the last scene. It was almost embarrassing. I thought about deducting one star because of it, but then decided against it, as it was just reflective of the era in which the film was made. Actually, the whole movie was reflective of the era in which it was made, but that last scene was just too sexist for words. When you see it, you will know what I mean.
Fans of Bette Davis will surely enjoy this movie, as will those who love classic films.",1011571200,12,1627,4.752650176678445
477948,5,6302548411,Oh what can be said for Bette except that she was one of the best stars of all time.... I have about 11 movies of hers and my collection is growing rapidly.....This was a very good movie a must see.....,998179200,5,202,4.075
477949,4,6302548411,"""June Bride"" tells the story of a magazine editor (Bette Davis) who goes to Indiana with her staffers and a fellow journalist -- and ex-boyfriend (Robert Montgomery) -- to cover a small-town wedding. I found this movie very enjoyable. It's nice to see Bette Davis in a comedy role. And Robert Montgomery gives an enjoyably hammy performance (always somehow making me think of Bob Hope). The two of them are very good together. Yes, the catch is the ending. As in two other Bette Davis films of the era -- ""All About Eve"" and ""The Star"" -- the career woman chucks her career at the end to be with a man. Up until this point, I couldn't help feeling how nice it was for a Forties film to depict an intelligent, successful career woman. But this was the sensibility of the time. The film is still well-written, and knowing Bette Davis, she won't be carrying those suitcases for too long! (If you see the movie, you'll understand.)",994896000,6,927,4.5568862275449105
477950,3,6302548411,"Bette Davis stars as an editor of a lifestyles magazine who is underpressure to complete a feature about a typical midwestern girl's ideal wedding, complete with a makeover of the bride's house and family.  To add to Davis' problems, the man hired to write the feature article is an old boyfriend who prefers writing about hard news instead of fluff pieces.  Robert Montgomery stars as her former flame, and as he, Davis, and the rest of her team invade the family's house to prepare for the wedding, the problems really start - for the family and the former lovers.  Montgomery gives a breezy, flip performance that adds much to the film.  Davis does well enough as the straight lady amidst the chaos, although this is one of the least memorable roles you'll ever see her in.  There aren't enough genuine laughs to make this a great comedy, and the potentially funny situations that could arise from Davis' magazine team making over the house aren't really explored.  It's a pleasant movie to watch, but little else.",979948800,2,1017,4.782857142857143
477951,2,6302548411,"A comedy that is funny is hard to find, and a comedy that is both funny  and self-conscious is almost impossible to find. I've seen two comedies  last night : ""The Lady Eve"" and ""June Bride"" Which just  can't be compared at all. The first one is in the second category I  mentionned in the beginning, and ""June Bride"" isn't in neither of  them. That's not it's fault basically, because it does contains some  laughs. And to my surprise most of them came from Bette davis who showed  some versatility at comedy. She was both though and harmless facing the  love she felt for Robert Montgomery. It was interesting. But the problem is  that it isn,t really about anything except to make you laugh. And if it  would have succeeded in its goal then it would have been great, but it  didn't. The characters were marginals but never really developped. Why  didn't they think of using Cary's (Montgomery) alcohol addiction as a  subject for great slapstick scenes instead of just one flat scene. For  example,  a scene where Montgomery gets drunk and has to confront Davis.  With great writing, and direction, you just know both actors would have  been able to pull some great laughs out of the audiences. Unfortunatly,  there is no such scene like that in the picture, except for an early scene  at Davis's place where she opens the light and he closes them continuously.  That would have been a perfect start for a perfect comedy, but as the movie  grows most of the suporting characters forget their personalities behind  and becomes rusty tools for the two leading actors. Too Bad.",962668800,3,1577,4.678832116788321
