5073465,2,B007BHA2M6,"... pretending to be a girl who travels in a van with four musicians (?) this flick was obviously made to titillate the curiosity of the average girl as to what life is REALLY like for groupies. The acting is poor, the direction was obviously hampered by a small budget and D-list actors. Of curiosity only to those who want to remember those days. ""The Banger Sisters"" is better.",1392681600,,380,4.521739130434782

5073467,4,B007BHA2M6,"This movie 'Groupie Girl' provides great insight into the true life of a hippie. It showcases the progressive maturity of a naive young woman who enters the the lifestyle and the decisions she makes that shapes her human character. In a sense this movie has a sentiment for every viewer, which is one of learning from decisions made as a young person. The acting isn't great, but it is the plot that drew me into the film. The characters are developed enough for the viewing audience to identify with the ones necessary to understand the point of the film, which is progressive maturity at a Tim that is confusing for teens as they enter adulthood. This is a b-movie with an intentional underlined plot and has a depth that is memorable-not Oscar material-but helps every person to identify with the folly and growth of the human spirit. Groupie Girl is the right movie for such an audience. That's why it gets four stars. However, the only disappointment is the brevity of the career of Esme Johns. I found her character intriguing and her acting, although a little underdeveloped, still the reason that this film had a cohesive continuity. Check out Groupie Girl for any b-movie con issuer.",1370217600,2,1192,4.763285024154589
5073468,4,B007BHA2M6,"I love films that have a good story, most often, but sometimes I will watch a film simply because I want to see what people were wearing during a particular time period.  This film falls into the latter category.  It has a great 60s/70s look.",1368921600,4,242,4.355555555555555
5073469,3,B007BHA2M6,"Not much acting here. Just some latent long hair musicians and micro mini skirt wearing hippie girls out of the UK simply being themselves. Yet... some of the scenes are for show only. The girl fight scenes show them smiling, when they should be crying in pain. Not Oscar winning acting for sure. But still gives us an honest glimpse of this period's craziness and cheaply made B movies, like movie makers couldn't replicate today! .....back when freedom of expression, whether good or bad was pretty much in your face and it all seemed so normal!

I liked it.... but I didn't love it. Yet.... Billy Boyle (Irish Actor) got famous and laid often making movies showing off his self-centered wise guy attitude and wild wicked personality in these films! :D",1365811200,,754,4.755725190839694

5073471,5,B007BHA2M6,"Ignore the other review - that is of a completely different film.  The plot of Groupie Girl bears no relation to that.

Groupie Girl is a late 60s, British sexploitation flick, but made with decent production values and a superb soundtrack.  By modern standards the nudity is minimal, but the film is worth watching for the story.  It concerns a bored young girl who decides to run away with a band as a groupie.  The film portrays the band/hippy culture in pretty unflattering terms, which is quite unusual, but the film's writer was herself a groupie so there is probably a fair bit of realism in it.  Its more a snapshot of late 60s British culture, and most of its stars were part of that scene (many of the band members were genuine musicians, not actors).  In fact the star, Esme Johns, was a stripper that the producers found in a club; this was her only film and she faded back into obscurity, which is a shame as she isn't at all bad as an actress.

Its a real slice of the late 60s, if you enjoy something interesting and offbeat, give this a try.",1188086400,22,1057,4.384615384615385

8513797,3,B007BHA2M6,"I wouldn't go out of my way to watch this movie, but as a sort of rough period piece (as viewed today...it was released in 1970, so obviously wasn't intended as such :) ) that includes a fair amount of original music, it has enough to hold a person's interest if they have any fondness of or nostalgia for the 60's music scene but don't mind a bit of honesty in their revisiting of the time.

Sally starts out at a local gig with some friends, but stows away in the band's van and is discovered only as they try to puzzle their way out of town. She tags along to the next show, where she finds a new band to follow. She sticks with them, until they get bored and hand her over to yet another band. This time her move is made by her being handed through the windows of the two bands' vans while they are still speeding down a highway.

Her treatment by the bands is misogynistic and childish, but not to worry. The group that sent her packing while still on the highway pays the ultimate price in the ensuing crash, moments after she's safely aboard the other's van.

The first half of the movie is especially sparse. Brief vignettes tied together by longer musical performances account for what little plot exists. The second half digs a little deeper, but in the end amounts to little more than Sally being sequestered long enough for the whole highway crash situation to blow over. During that time, she meets the one ""deep soul"" character in the story (Wesley), but after yet another unwanted advance, this time from the most recent band's manager, finally heads home.

Wesley is such a kind-hearted gentleman, he tears after her in his car, catching up with her as she nears the end of the driveway of the manor where they are staying, and hands her a little cash to help her on her way. I guess a lift to the bus station would be just too much of an imposition.

As another reviewer notes, the movie does an okay job hinting at the degrading and heartless treatment these ""groupie girls"" experienced. Sally and her cohort (other women show up in the story here and there) are handed around like property and expected to provide sex and housekeeping in return for the privilege of being ""with the band"". It's debatable how that's much different from the norm of how women were treated at the time, or even how many still are today for that matter.

But the movie is elevated just a bit for its frank treatment of the subject (inasmuch as such a lightly-plotted movie can treat any subject). One hopes only that at the time, that treatment was viewed as somehow introspective rather than just being an unsurprising, unabashed portrayal of the status quo.",1405555200,2,2657,4.490683229813665
8513798,2,B007BHA2M6,"During the revolutionary years of 60s, 70s and 80s thousands of B Movies have been made all over the world , specially Europe and United States. The contents of these movies are exciting, hot, funny, scary and so on with not much of censorship and conservatism for sex and violence which make them an enjoyable experience to watch for those who are interested in this kind of oldies.
This movie did not have enough elements of excitement for me , so I gave it only two stars.",1397520000,,475,4.471264367816092
