7855243,5,630392042X,This is a great movie.  The only thing is that I would like to find a DVD version.,1466812800,,82,3.5555555555555554
7855244,5,630392042X,Excellent!,1454457600,,10,10.0
7855245,4,630392042X,"I was reminded of this movie when I saw Bruce Dern in ""Nevada"".  It's about a rehab retreat for victims of torture run by Vanessa Redgrave.  Laura Dern plays a reporter that was captured and tortured in some un-named South American country.  Her photographer and lover was murdered at the same time.  Raul Julia plays another torture victim from SA.  It was his last movie before he died of cancer.  Of course they fall in love, then she finds out who he really is.  I was moved when I first saw it and thought I would see it again, but it evidently it was never put on disc.  Fortunately I still have my VHS player.",1396828800,,616,4.2956521739130435
7855246,3,630392042X,Honestly I do not remember the plot.  Was there one?  We liked Raul Julia and will miss him.  He has turned in better performances.,1320019200,,131,4.375
7855247,4,630392042X,"I had never seen Raul Julia (sp) before this film and I thought he was awesome. I never much cared for Laura Dern but this film seems to be her masterpiece.

Don't watch this film unless you are willing to focus on something/feelings that are disturbing.

I highly recommend it.",1298073600,,278,4.54
7855248,3,630392042X,"As one reviewer pointed out..blotchy.
Laura Doern does  an excellent job....but can't save this film.

The men chasing one of the characters are meant to be menacing but they come off as inept....as if lost.
Raul Julia could have done this role in his sleep.
The mark of a good film IMHO is that it should leave you 'feeling' something. It did...the feeling of being let down.
No good reason to own this flick.
Perhaps the real torture in this film was watching it. Maybe I should remove 1/2 a star.
Much of this film was shot in Toronto...so that kept me somewhat curious.",1214006400,,573,4.5
7855249,5,630392042X,"A story which really gets under your skin! I work with refugees who have been tortured and abused and I recognized many of the reactions the different characters had in the movie.
It was a very believable cast, and although the story skips back and forth between past experiences and present it is not disturbing as it moves the story forward. Also, this is what it is like for many survivors of torture... They can't tell their whole story in one sitting as it is too painful. Maybe it would be for the audience too!
Not to take anything for granted is a valuable story to learn. As well as to realize that there are as many reactions to torture as there are people.
An interesting twist at the end emphasizes the problematical trust-issues many torture survivors grapple with. That's important because it seems through my professional experience that this is the one thing people really struggle with when they are survivors. How do you know who to trust and who not to trust? To a survivor of torture this can be extremely hard to handle as the feeling of ""Nothing and no one can really be trusted"" seems common. And what may happen to survivors if they start trusting the wrong people? Remember, once everything the survivor believed about other people, proved to be not only wrong, but extremely dangerous.
Watch the movie if you want to understand more about the issues of torture, abuse and healing!",1039132800,8,1406,4.673387096774194
7855250,5,630392042X,Such a touching story. And Laura Dern's presentation is right on. Not a film for people without sentimentality. And the twist at the end is fab. But again emotionally believable. Everyone is this film seems to be from an acting achool of excellence.,993081600,5,249,4.813953488372093
