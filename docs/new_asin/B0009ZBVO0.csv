8070720,2,B0009ZBVO0,"If you are a fan of Toshiro Mifume films or the classic Japanese films of the 50's and 60's I doubt you will enjoy this film, I did not.  I still can not understand why they kept running around saying it doesn't matter.  Mifume's acting was again superb, but like I said the rest of the film was difficult to grasp.",1517788800,,315,4.147540983606557
8070721,4,B0009ZBVO0,"RED LION is a less known position in Toshiro Mifune rich career, but this is one of the most interesting samurai movies I ever saw. It is clearly influenced by the events of 1968 around the world - the story is about a peasant revolt (and its suppression) in time of a great regime change and it has some (limited) quasi marxist accents.

Mifune plays a peasant soldier serving imperial troops during the fight of emperor Meiji against the Tokugawa shogunate in 1867-69 civil war. He is send by his commander to his native village to check the situation there - and his arrival will start a peasant rebellion against local bosses. The story begins with almost slapstick comism before turning much darker...

I appreciated this movie greatly and unlike other reviewers I didn't even notice that there was something wrong with the image or sound on DVD. The film is visually very beautiful, with the costumes of samurais being particularly impressive. The director (Kihachi Okamoto) does a great job, like in his earlier production ""Kiru!"". Mifune is at the top of his form and he clearly just loved doing this movie, because he displays possibly every expression available in his actor arsenal... Takahashi Etsushi, who also played in ""Kiru!"", is playing an important role of Hanzo, the ""fast drawing swordsman"".

This movie is really atypical - its message (""Beware of all governments - they are all equally bad!"") is openly subversive, but the story proves the point really well. I still can not rate it as high as ""Seven samurai"", ""Ran"", ""Chushingura"" or even ""Kiru!"", but this movie made me really think more than most of other samurai films I saw...",1348444800,2,1653,4.8546099290780145
8070722,4,B0009ZBVO0,"I admit that through most of the film I simply could not understand what the film was trying to do. It wasn't until I got near the end, and then read the notes in the extras, that I realized this was really a film with a strong populist message and was based on a true historical event. Mifune shows a gift for comedy that at first surprised me and made me wonder what on earth he was doing, but finally won me over and made me look forward to repeat viewings. Also, this type of Japanese humor is new to me and obviously I wasn't prepared for it. I think it is also helpful to keep in mind that this film was made in 1969, a time when people all over the world, like the people in the movie, had hopes for social, political and economic change that would improve their lives, and therefore its message was powerful then, and is still powerful today, for me at least. And Mifune really is a great actor. I mean, that scene where he is drunk and goes to meet the samurai in the street. How does he manage to look drunk just by the expression in his eyes? What other actor can do that?",1283731200,8,1083,4.113207547169812
8070723,5,B0009ZBVO0,"Set around the time of the end of the Shogun era and the end of the samurai, Red Lion shows a turbulent world in the midst of change. But instead of Yojimbo style with gritty violence and grim amorality, Red Lion is farcical and Mifune Toshiro is a comical character not the brooding cold calculating character he was in Yojimbo.

Mifune plays a soldier in the new imperial army. He asks permission from his commander to ride ahead to his hometown to announce their arrival. He also begs to borrow the red mane headdress from which the title comes from. Red mane headdress is symbol of an officer in the Imperial Army and Mifune wants this so he can look like a big shot when he comes riding in. His arrival sets off a chain of reaction as various factions in the town are scheming against each other in the wake of the changes going on in the country. The old order are afraid of Mifune and some want him dead while progressives hope he will lead them in vanquishing the old order in the town who are officials and supporters of the ailing Shogun government.

If you are interested in Japanese history, Red Lion won't exactly give you an historical account of the end of samurai period of Japan but it will give you the essence of chaos of that time period. Overall it's a quirky movie with some funny moments that's worth a watch.",1262476800,7,1332,4.4105691056910565
8070724,5,B0009ZBVO0,This is a bit different for T. Mifune but he always does what the diredctor expects of him.  Good story line.,1188777600,,109,4.190476190476191
