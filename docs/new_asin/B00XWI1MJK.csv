7202109,2,B00XWI1MJK,"Bought this to add to episodes 1-7 that I had previously purchased and donated to the local public library. Maria Wern is a police detective in Visby on Gotland, the largest Swedish island. There, among the tremendous beauty of the Swede's favorite vacation isle, she battles crime and murder. She is the brainchild of prolific Swedish crime and children's author Anna Jansson. The format of the stories is common to most crime story lovers: dead body show up, lot of disparate clues and suspects, maybe another murder or two and a solution that ties up (most) loose ends. Episode 8 begins with a mugging in a park and a domestic dispute and quickly spirals into multiple homicides where no suspect will cooperate with the authorities. Episode 9 take place during celebrations of the island's Medieval past where an arson baffles the locals and stuns them when the child's skull found in the ashes is discovered to be over 1000 years old!  Both 90 minutes films have less family backstory than episodes 1-7 and her husband is now dead long enough to allow a flirtation between the attractive 38 year old Wern and a much younger detective. With the exception of the flirtation, the stories are rather tightly written and move along at a neat pace to hold the interest of viewers but not as good as episodes 1-6. Acting is fine. The Hanseatic League and World Heritage City of Visby could be shown more but what scenery that is shown is an asset. What is not an asset and what dropped my rating from an easy 3/4 is the incredibly aggravating use of a hand held camera. The shaking screen is distracting and, in fact, a barrier to enjoying the program because the user needs to read the English subtitles and try to focus on the action through the lense of a director who must want the camera to be part of the story. I do not recall where a handheld camera added to the enjoyment of a program. If you can enjoy reading subtitles while the screen behind is shaking, then the grade will be higher. There is little gore and only a few four letter words used, including the gratuitous use of the f-word. Recommend episodes 1-7 but not 8-9. An interesting side note. I checked with my local public library to see if the DVD's justified donating episodes 8 & 9. They had be checked out over 50 times in the past two plus years which shows that they have been VERY popular.",1436659200,14,2364,4.549295774647887

8716907,5,B00XWI1MJK,"In my opinion, this is one of the best female detectives of all.  I like her and I trust her.  She is very dedicated, both to her career and to her family, a difficult thing to do.  I like the wy her brain works.  She is high intelligent, and it is fu to try to figure out how what she is thinking.  She gives lots of food for thought, which I like.  I love the story lines of all and wish she would make many more episodes.  The stories are well-executed in all aspects.  Although she may not be for everyone, I have re-watched all of episodes at least three times, as I get something new each time I watch. What I like is that any times when new episodes are added, new seasons are renewed,  many times with the modernization come subtle changes of the main character as, I guess, life proceeds, and ultimately the character changes from the original.  Then starts the political correctness of trying to right gender bias, or other types of bias, and this can be deleterious to the story line forcing characters to embrace such changes.  We, who live the life, know that these prejudices exist out there and come into contact with it on a daily basis, so we try to make changes to improve the situation and make the world more perfect.  But it ends up that perfect world out there is not perfect because the changes are forced upon us, but few people are affected by them.  Enough. Maria Wern is consistent the same over time and shoulders her own resentments too, because they re the reality.",1447027200,3,1495,4.3731884057971016

8716909,5,B00XWI1MJK,"Coming into this series relatively late with episodes 8 and 9, I was initially left wanting to know more about the central characters. However I quickly got over it and found myself thoroughly enjoying yet another police thriller from Sweden.

It seems each new mystery show has to have a gimmick, which is understandable.  The gimmick with MARIA WERN is that it is set on the tiny island of Gotland, which is part of Sweden.  The premise is that Maria Wern, a police detective and single mother, wishes to move there with her three children in the hope of establishing a nice, quiet (for a detective) life for themselves.

Obviously we wouldn't have a very watchable series if that were the case!  Somewhat like MIDSOMER MURDERS in that regard (where there is a disproportionate body count for the population) MARIA WERN sees herself involved in all sorts of murderous activity.

Of the two episodes in this package, the second (episode nine in the series) is especially interesting as it incorporates a medieval festival as part of its background.  Gotland has an incredibly rich history, as shown by an extraordinary amount of rich archaeological findings.  It is a wise move on the part of the producers to include Gotland's history in the plot lines.

As for Maria Wern herself, she is played by Eva Rose, a very accomplished Swedish actress whose career includes a part in Steven Spielberg's MUNICH (later cut out), an audition for the role of a Bond Girl in DIE ANOTHER DAY and a number of classical stage roles including plays by Tennessee Williams and Bertolt Brecht.  With this acting pedigree, playing Maria Wern might be slumming for a less conscientious actress, but Rose invests Maria with everything she's got.  There's a reason the show is named after her character: the show is less about murders (although there are plenty of them) and more about the character of Maria Wern--at least what I can tell from watching these two later episodes in the series.

Let's face it, there are an awful lot of detective shows out there vying for our attention.  All I can say to that is for this reviewer, MARIA WERN was worth my time.",1444003200,,2140,4.766937669376694
8716910,4,B00XWI1MJK,I enjoyed it although I did not think these two episodes were as good as the prior episodes.,1441497600,,92,4.166666666666667
8716911,5,B00XWI1MJK,Loved the first seven episodes when I watched them and was very excited to find that two more episodes had been made. They aren't quite as good as the first two but still glad to have them. Hope there will be more but if they do I hope they go back to where the first ones were filmed as the scenery was  so beautiful there.,1441152000,2,324,3.9846153846153847
8716912,3,B00XWI1MJK,"Not up to the previous fine episodes.  The ""mysteries"" were weak and
could have been covered in one-half hour.  The remaining time seemed
to be padding.",1441065600,3,152,4.8076923076923075
