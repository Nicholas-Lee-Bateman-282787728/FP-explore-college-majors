8219917,5,B000VT7300,"After spending a summer in Canada, we became huge fans of Corner Gas. As a goodbye gift, one of our new Canadian friends gave us the first season of Corner Gas to bring home to the States. We wore out our copy and decided to invest in the rest of the series. Worthwhile investment! Corner Gas is the best TV series I've ever enjoyed. Brilliantly funny, great for the whole family, and a lovable, memorable cast.",1412208000,,411,4.421052631578948
8219918,5,B000VT7300,"I was introduced to this Canadian TV show years ago by a friend with relatives in Canada.  The acting is great, as are the episodes.  So funny.  I pop the disks in the DVD player whenever I want a good laugh.",1325203200,,208,4.024390243902439
8219919,5,B000VT7300,"If you have watched the first three seasons, then you already know what a great sitcom this is.  Don't hesitate to purchase this becuase it is just as good as the other three seasons if not better.  Highly recommended.
Enjoy!",1207785600,,225,4.6
