likes children.
The story line is well edited and moves smoothly.
The two girls are charming, children who almost anyone would love to adopt.
The two host parents have the two girls visit from Russia for a month.  It's great to see the relationship between the host parents and
the two girls develop.
The acting is excellent.  Be sure to see this movie.",1432339200,,479,4.6
8218729,4,B000VI6Y2Y,"I bought this DVD because I'd heard good things about the movie from some of the actors in it.  I was not disappointed.  Bob and Julie (Alun Armstrong and Lindsey Coulson) somewhat reluctantly open their home to two girls from Belarus who are suffering from the effects of the Chernobyl disaster.  In the process they all learn different ways to respond to life's glitches.  The young actors are both excellent, particularly Anna Krippa who plays the demanding role of Nelli, who besides dealing with language and cultural difficulties must also learn how to live in a loving and supportive home.  The movie is just over an hour long, and could have benefited by a longer running time allowing a more in-depth look at motives.  If there had been more exposition and character development, I think I would have given this 5 stars.",1345248000,4,829,4.802816901408451
