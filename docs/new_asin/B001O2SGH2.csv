8329018,4,B001O2SGH2,"I'd give it a 4.5.  An unemployed abusive father, (Michale Nyqvist), is nearly killed by his young son who can't take the abuse anymore.  Mom and son dump the 'body', but police find Dad in time to save his life.  The boy is terrified to learn that his father is still alive and plans to returns home.  The main story line and characters of this movie are all very, very strong.  The boy actor(Soulis)does an incredible job with what is really difficult subject matter.  Considering his age, I was highly impressed.  Mom (Alexandra Rapaport) also showed strong presence in the film and was excellent in her role.  Michael nailed his role, as he always does, as an abusive dad.  My only criticism relates to the screenplay. I found it a bit weak in spots - some of the medical issues relating to the Dad character really didn't play well.  The major scenes, though, are intense anyway due to the wonderful acting abilities of the cast.  Really a good Saturday night, plenty of popcorn kind of movie. If you're thinking about buying this movie, go for it. You won't be disappointed.",1302048000,2,1080,4.631578947368421
