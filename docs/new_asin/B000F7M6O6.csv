8118731,5,B000F7M6O6,This dvd says region 2 and will not play on either Blue ray player or my computer. I bought it from Amazon and it's the first item that has not worked. Bummer.,1463270400,,159,4.0
8118732,3,B000F7M6O6,"One of three films Tucker made whilst in England.  This one is a plodder. More like a paid vacation for Tucker, as he did not make a whole lot of money on the deal.  But he did enjoy his stay in England and his association with the locals.  The best of the three is ""The Trollenberg Terror""  aka ""The Crawling Eye"".",1443484800,,315,4.114754098360656
8118733,4,B000F7M6O6,"THE STRANGE WORLD OF PLANET X (aka: COSMIC MONSTERS) is an ultra-goofy, but entertaining sci-fi film from 1958. Experiments w/ magnetism, an alien visitor, and mammoth, flesh-eating bugs, all converge on a small English town. Sort of like THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL for numb-skulls. Still, it is entertaining, especially when the giant cockroaches eat off people's faces! Stars Forrest Tucker (THE CRAWLING EYE, THE ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN). Recommended for your next hullabaloo...",1442620800,,479,5.575342465753424
8118734,3,B000F7M6O6,"Forrest Tucker stars as a somewhat subdued scientist working for a deranged mad scientist who's invented a machine which inadvertently opens a door to another dimension. An alien arrives, acting in ""enlightened self-interest"" to stem the tide of horrors the machine has unleashed. Very shapely female lead with a difficult-to-understand accent.

Something of a curiosity overall. The last piece of a trifecta of British sci fi movies from the 50s, X The Unknown, The Terror of the Trollenberg, and finally this movie. if you're a completist, go for it. Otherwise -- this film is not going to entertain everyone, not by a long shot.",1386028800,,631,5.0673076923076925
8118735,4,B000F7M6O6,"Requires an all-region disc player. Really nice copy of a very old sci-fi film, crisp black and white and in wide screen. Thank you.",1357516800,3,132,4.541666666666667
8118736,3,B000F7M6O6,"Proof, if there needed to be any, that the English can make a piece of dreck the equal of anything in the u.s. An attack of giant bugs for some reason or other. Enjoyable and fun really, until the climax (forgive the pun of the last letter) when the amateurish and rather unpleasant effects take over.",1321056000,,301,4.392857142857143
8118737,3,B000F7M6O6,"This is one of the three greatest Forrest Tucker Sci-Fi movies along with ""The Crawling Eye"" (1958) and ""The Abominable Snowman"" (1957).

The classic Sci-fi where the mad scientist experiments with nature to everyone's peril and possibly demise.  Messing with the earth's magnetic field can have dangerous circumstances and it is up to the military to clean up the mess.

Mean while back at the think tank we get treated to what could be a Mnage  trios. That is if no one gets shot.

Martin Benson as the alien Smith adds just the right about credence to the film as Mohammed in the film ""Sphinx"" (1981)

Yes this is an inexpensive British production but it goes a lot further than most of the genre such as"" Devil Girl from Mars"" (1954).",1309564800,5,738,4.595419847328245
8118738,4,B000F7M6O6,"Better know as ""COSMIC MONSTERS"" (The U.S. title), this DD Entertainment R2 PAL DVD presents the film under its UK title ""The Strange World of Planet X"". Like the afore mentioned ""The Crawling Eye"" this film also stars Forrest Tucker. Image quality is very good and presented in Anamorphic Widescreen (1.66:1 / the cover is incorrectly marked as 4:3). Disc is barebones with just a menue screen with chapter selections. English soundtrack with no subtitles. Not available in region 1 this DVD is a nice addition to any 1950's Sci-Fi/Horror collection if you have a region free player.",1296000000,4,584,4.969387755102041
