The movie's about a once wealthy family, that is going through hard times.  The family consist of a father, mother, cute teenage daughter (Nanako) and teenage step son (Yujiro).  Nanako constantly needs assistance because of her poor health.  Because of this, Yujiro is always by her side.  Behind closed doors, Nanako is secretly making passionate love with her step brother (Yujiro).  Everything was going ok until one night, they were caught having sex by their mother.  Yujiro was quickly banished away to England.  A short time later, Nanako's father made some poor investment which put the family into debt.  A stranger came by to see Nanako.  He told her he knew a way she can get the family out of debt.  The deal was, Nanako had to become a sex slave to the 10+ men her father owe'd money to.  She accepted the deal.  In her poor condition, she was raped over and over.

Not long after that, with still more bad investments, the people her father owe'd money to barged into the their house.  The 10+ men raped Nanako and her mother in front of her father.  During the rapes, Nanako is thinking about her step brother Yujiro.

Just as I was really getting interested into the movie, the movie ended!  Will she see her step brother (Yujiro)?  What happens to her next?  Is there going to be sequel?  What does the Title of the movie mean?

The sex scenes were above average, the characters were drawn very well, and the movie is dubbed very well in English.  I would have given this movie 5 stars if this 30 minute movie had a better ending.",1341619200,2,1655,4.54421768707483
