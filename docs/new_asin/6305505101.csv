3714437,5,6305505101,"I like this movie & the Wilbur Smith novel upon which it is based.  Roger Moore gives one of the best performances of his career.  The supporting actors are strong.  The script, co-written by Wilbur Smith,  is very good.  Music is excellent.  What is not excellent or even acceptable is the quality of the Synergy video from Amazon Prime.  We have an old VHS of this movie which has clean visuals & sound.  Don't know why the video from Amazon is such poor quality.",1421539200,,465,4.4523809523809526

3714446,3,6305505101,"I've owned this movie on VHS for many years and it is a great movie.  Unfortunately, I have issues with the quality of this DVD.  It is slightly better than the VHS, but I found two things to be particularly irritating.  There are some (not many) curse words in this movie and Platinum Disc LLC apparently took it upon themselves to bleep out these words!  If I want to watch an edited movie, I'll watch it on TV.  I purchased this movie expecting it to be exactly like the VHS, and I was quite astounded when all of the curse words were bleeped out.  Also, in the bottom right corner of the screen, the logo ""Platinum Disc"" kept popping up throughout the movie, then it would go away, only to pop up again later.  Very distracting and annoying.

Overall, I like having this movie on DVD, but I would have liked it better if it had not been altered.",1405296000,,849,4.29559748427673
3714447,1,6305505101,Quality of the print made this movie unwatchable. Very disappoimnting.not to be able to watch what I remember to be a good movie.,1397865600,,129,4.6521739130434785
3714448,5,6305505101,"First and most importantly, this is ALL REGION and plays in the USA on a standard Blu Ray Player.... another bonus is the 48 minute documentary on Roger Moore which is also viewable.  Sometimes even all region BR discs have the bonus features in PAL and don't play ...this disc gives you the full movie in widescreen 2:35 aspect ratio and looking terrific along with the bonus feature in the more TV aspect ratio of 1:33.  Director Peter Hunt (former editor on Bond flicks and also the director of the superior Bond movie On her Majesties Secret Service, along with the superior Roger Moore / Lee Marvin film ""Shout At The Devil"") handles action very well and this movie moves along at a nice clip as one would suspect directed by a man of his experience.  This movie has been available in terrible DVD releases over the years and this BR is the one to own.",1397520000,,857,4.480769230769231
3714449,2,6305505101,Squashed from wide screen into a narrow format which you can't change; this ruins the picture so film is unwatchable.,1397433600,,117,4.9
3714450,1,6305505101,"It's a very poor copy. I remember watching this movie after seeing Roger Moore in Las Vegas many years ago when me,my sister Mary and brother Eric were ousted out of a casino because we were under age,We had been left outside waiting for our driver to pick us up. Mary and I were love struck and Roger seemed like a god to us. Love the story though. They don.t make movies like this one anymore.",1389744000,,395,4.2105263157894735
3714451,5,6305505101,It's a great story well told by Wilbur Smith and even though some of the side plot's had to be droped it does the book justice and I realy enjoyed it.,1386028800,,150,3.870967741935484

3714453,2,6305505101,"I have been a fan of this movie for many yearss and was excited when I found it on Amazon.  Unfortunately, the quality of the print is average to poor, and the movie has been edited for language (at least) with periodic gaps in the dialog.  There was no mention in the description that it was an edited version and that is a big disappointment.  The movie is still great fun, but would have liked to had all the movie, and with a much better video quality.",1347235200,,456,4.218390804597701
3714454,4,6305505101,Roger Moore presented another side of his acting abilities.  He played a mining engineer who finished his engineering degree through correspondence school.  Roger falls for his bosses' wife and they begin having a fling as the boss is trying to topple the gold market.  The action and views from inside a real mine was very educational.,1329436800,,336,4.964285714285714
3714455,2,6305505101,"I loved Roger Moore in the Saint and the Persauders.
He was good as Bond. I liked most of the movies he's
made but this isn't one. It had Ray Milland that I
like and Braford Dillman so I figured it was good.
The production is cheap and the quality isn't good
so that made it hard to watch. It's more of a love
story than a ripoff movie. I found it hard to watch.
Moore is great as always you can tell he put his effort
into it but it didn't work. Maybe better quality dvd
would help cause it wasn't boring. I can't recommend.
buy the Persauders tv series with Tony Curtis! GREAT!",1324944000,,579,4.043478260869565
3714456,5,6305505101,Gold is perhaps one of the  more  missed movies by Roger Moore.  It is a  well made movie and Roger Moore shines as  a Mining engineer that give a damn about his men.  Few actors could have carried off the role  but the actor who played the Saint and James Bond shows why he got both roles. It is a must see for any Roger Moore fan and for anyone  liking a well  made movie. I was glad that Amazon had this movie.,1316649600,,413,3.8795180722891565
3714457,5,6305505101,"This movie is fast paced, features Roger Moore in his pre-bond prime and stars the always lovely and beguiling Susannah York.  With Bradford Dillman and Ray Milland, Gold proves to be an adventure, a mystery, and an international thriller all in one.  The film needs to be remastered, but it enjoyable when one considers the very reasonable price of the DVD.

For Roger Moore and Susannah York fans I recommend it highly.",1298678400,,421,4.819444444444445
3714458,3,6305505101,"Not too bad.  Susanna York outshines Roger Moore.  A little long on the entry scenes on going down into the mine, but the film recovers.  It ends nicely.  If you want a plain old good Sat night movie at home with some popcorn, you will enjoy this one.",1291766400,,251,4.166666666666667
3714459,5,6305505101,"This is truly a movie to see time and again.  It has it all - an engrossing and intelligent plot, the right character actors for each role, location (filmed in Africa), nasty villains, hero's, romance, etc.  It all plays out so well that I simply cannot understand why this movie was off the radar screen?! Roger Moore was never cast better - and certainly full-filled his part better than any role I've seen him in.  See this movie, and if you truly don't agree with my description - well, you are one hard person to please!!",1278028800,,526,4.458333333333333
3714460,4,6305505101,"One of Moore's best non-Bond films.  Realistic, great underground, in-the-mine effects.  I would have enjoyed seeing it in widescreen, but apparently it isn't available.",1269216000,,169,6.0
3714461,1,6305505101,"It looks like a pirated copy someone taped off a television airing. The ""bad"" words are bleeped out and the sound and picture quality hint that it was copied from an old vhs tape. The packaging is cheap, as well. Why Amazon allows this inferior garbage to be sold on their site in the guise of a legitimate product, is beyond me. They should try to protect their customers from this kind of swindle.",1244851200,,399,4.405405405405405
3714462,5,6305505101,"This movie by Roger Moore has it all. It is

3714463,5,6305505101,"Recently, we read Roger Moore's book ""My Word is my Bond"" and thanks to this excellent biography of all the work accomplished by Roger Moore, we became familiar with movies we had never seen by our favorite... Bond, James Bond. So, we are trying to see all his films.

In Gold, Roger Moore stars with Susannah York in this movie about the dire consequences of greed. The plot revolves around South African gold mines and a group of wealthy men who plot to destroy the way of life of one of the South African gold mine wealthy owners to tamper with gold prices in the global market. Once this gold mine is eliminated by flooding, the price of gold should go up making them rather wealthy.

These men are ruthless and in their search for control, power and wealth, they are willing to put the lives of over a thousand men at risk. But, Rod Slater, played by Roger Moore is the manager who foresees the possibilities of catastrophic events and plans accordingly.

Susannah York plays the role of the wife of one of the ruthless men, a hypochondriac who no longer makes her happy. She meets the character played by Moore and enters into an extra-marital relationship that deepens as the days go by.

Thanks to Roger Moore's book, My Word is my bond we find out that because of Apartheid, the legal racial segregation enforced by the National Party government of South Africa between 1948 and 1990, the trade union would not permit filming in South Africa. Much discussion takes place and finally, the crew arrives in Johannesburg in September of 1973 and was able to film without any political message portraying a difference between races.

We also discover that the mines are real and as Roger Moore tells us; ""to be faced with real conditions as an actor, helped him bring to life the character of Rod Slater.""

Reading Roger Moore's book has opened the door to a new way to enjoy these films because we know the tid-bits of information that would otherwise go unnoticed, making the film more interesting and enjoyable.

If you enjoy film history, read the book and keep a list of the movies mentioned by Moore. See these through the eyes of the actor, sometimes director, and you will find yourselves immersed in a world of fun travel opportunities. Don't miss it!",1231718400,,2264,4.645
3714464,2,6305505101,"I agree with most of my fellow reviewers on this project! Was lucky enough to have seen it on the big screen at the time of its release in 1974 so was truly enthralled throughout the film at that time.

If Amazon has any pull with the producers of this less than clean production for DVD I would encourage them to contact their supplier and suggest they attempt to find a better copy of the original print and re-release the DVD for I would even be willing to pay a premium price for a re-mastered copy of this film...",1230336000,,518,4.232323232323233

3714466,4,6305505101,"Above average film for the time.  The acting is also ok for the time period.  As far as being an action/thriller, things don't heat up until the last half of the movie.  The DVD transfer has to be the worst I have ever seen.  Nothing has been retouched and the color changes at times.",1214524800,,284,4.203703703703703
3714467,4,6305505101,"THis is a little known gem that has it all, great acting, great plot, great location setting and never a dull moment. Bradford Dillman is well cast as the chilly manipulator who tries to orchestrate a gold mine disaster in the hope that the ensuing stock market confusion will translate into riches for him and his offshore based investor cronies. John Gielgund's short stint is competent as ever. I am not a fan of Roger Moore's usual over acting but he delivers a credible performance here and then of course there is Susannah York, lovely to watch as ever - the attraction between the two also works well. All of this together with Peter Hunt's excellent direction, translate into a great and very entertaining action thriller. Although not platinum material, it is more than solid gold. People familiar with SA will recognize the Kyalami Ranch Hotel near the race track in one of the scenes.",1206230400,,895,4.780645161290322
3714468,4,6305505101,"Gold certainly comes over better in widescreen than it does in the cropped and edited TV and Public Domain prints that have been floating around for years. The first of Roger Moore's trio of South African shot adventures (along with Shout at the Devil and The Wild Geese), it's very much of its time: this being the mid-70s, the villains are easy to spot - they're the ones who wash their hands, don't smoke and aren't any good in the sack - while the good guys aren't afraid of a little dirt or sleeping with the boss's wife. Along with Moore the credits are littered with many of the regular Bond team most of whom would go through the same flooding-the-mine routine again in A View To a Kill - but then, since the film's hiking-up-the-price-of-gold premise is borrowed from Goldfinger (albeit a tad more credible than setting off a nuclear bomb in Fort Knox), there's no real cause for complaint. Like Elmer Bernstein and Jimmy Helms' title song, it's not subtle but it's an entertaining two hours if it catches you in the right mood.

At present, the only 2.35:1 widescreen transfer available is Ascot Media's legit German release. It's a pretty good transfer too, offering a stereo English soundtrack (there are slight synch problems in the last half hour, but these appear to be down to the original dubbing of the film as it's often only a line here and there). No real extras apart from a poorly reproduced stills gallery though.",1178236800,,1437,4.65748031496063
3714469,3,6305505101,"The movie is good but the reproduction of the DVD that I received was of a very poor quality! Obviously nobody wanted to spend money on making a good copy... what a pity!!!!

3714470,5,6305505101,"In any language GOLD will rock you. Go underground, way underground in this outstanding adventure romance film from director Peter Hunt.

GOLD rocks!",1166486400,,346,5.196428571428571
3714471,3,6305505101,This mid-70's film is genuinely enjoyable and dramatic. The music is great (with a high-energy title song and 70's disaster flick chick Maureen McGovern doing a great love theme in the middle of the film).  Roger Moore gives perhaps one of his two or three great non-Bond performances.  But don't buy it until it's done right in widescreen with a solid remastering job. It's a real shame that wasn't done first time out.  This is a genuinely good film with a small cult following.,1128124800,,480,4.690476190476191

This latest version is no better than some of the earlier VHS tapes/DVDs.  Don't be fooled.",1096243200,,303,4.921568627450981
3714474,4,6305505101,"This movie made by former Bond director Peter (On Her Majesty's Secret Service) Hunt and starring then 007 Roger Moore has all the hallmarks of a great fun action thriller. Yet, the action doesn't seem to truly pick up until the latter part of the movie when things start to go terribly wrong in a South African gold mine.
The plot - for what it's worth - revolves around plans to increase the value of gold stocks by flooding a gold mine in Africa, and the machinations employed to keep the manager of the mine (played by Moore) suitably distracted and away from the location to allow the villains plot to succeed.
A great cast supports Moore in this piece including Susannah York and Sir John Gielgud and it moves at a fair pace. The troubling aspect about this movie (and the reason I give it only four stars) is the poor treatment that has been afforded the picture on the DVD - it really does deserve to be redone and remastered.",1050624000,,934,4.436046511627907
3714475,1,6305505101,"Yes, I must agree with other reviews, the quality is very poor with words cut out. Strange when they claim it's restored from a ""master copy"".

However the quality of the Disc is just totally ..... period. The picture jumps the colours are awful and the sound also jumps. My old video copy that I taped from the tv and played hundreds of times is far superior to this.  I noticed on the availability list that there are two prices listed for this DVD.

8324078,5,6305505101,"I liked the movie. It started out slow and I wasn't sure what to make of it, but I kept watching and realized that it's basically a scheme to corner the Gold market by the grandson-in-law of the owner of one of the largest Gold mines in South Africa. Along the way we meet the character that Roger Moore plays who comes across as a maverick or maniac when it comes to the mine, that is not afraid to take risks and to have a plan just in case something happens. He meets the granddaughter of the owner and the two have chemistry and the granddaughters husband sees that and is willing to use his wife to get even richer.

The action builds slowly but when the mine is in trouble, Roger Moore's character will stop at nothing to save the mine. In the end, he succeeds and he gets the girl as her husband meets his fate and death. When the movie was made, Roger Moore had already starred as James Bond. The music score is good as well as are the supporting cast & characters. I watched the DVD on a CRT based TV set and had no issues with it.",1527465600,,1040,4.123152709359606

8324083,3,6305505101,"Gold was released 1974 between Roger Moore's first two Bond films. The first thing you'll notice is how poor the print quality is. Lots of dirt, scratches, dropouts, compressed sound and faded color. There is a BluRay version that is probably much cleaner, but that's not what you'll get from Amazon Prime.
The movie, itself, holds up well in terms of plot and entertainment value. It's essentially the Golfinger plot to destroy a major source of gold with the intent of skyrocketing the market price for mined gold.
There are some great actors in this movie besides Moore; John Guilgud, Ray Milland, Bradford Dillman and Susanah York. They are all fun to watch.
The film takes place in South Africa and it's not afraid to confront the blatant racism there. The apartheid policy was in full effect when this movie was made, but the racism surely still underlies relations between blacks and whites there today, and I was glad to see the movie address it as a minor plot point.
Overall, an entertaining two hours once you get used to the poor print quality.",1473638400,,1056,4.744565217391305
