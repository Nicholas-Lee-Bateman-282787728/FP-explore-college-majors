1848191,5,B00008IP4U,"WOW! What a fabulous workout. This DVD combines traditional yoga asanas with strength training. If you are looking for a power yoga routine definately give this one a try. No frills, easy to follow & challenging. A must for any yoga library.",1051228800,,241,4.761904761904762
1848192,5,B00008IP4U,If all Yoga videos and DVDs were like this one I would never take a class again! When you do this workout you feel as though you are in the studio taking the class. The instructor is easy to follow; you work up a sweat and feel great afterwards! Unlike many yoga tapes/DVDs this DVD shows many shots of the students. I really like this because you can find modifications for difficult poses quickly and easily just by seeing what some of the students are doing. The style of the video and the music are also really cool and set a great atmosphere for your workout. I have heard rumor that this studio is putting out another video. I hope this is the case because I would love to add it to my rotation!!,1089072000,5,702,4.246268656716418
1848193,5,B00008IP4U,"i have tried tons of power yoga tapes, this is my favorite. i feel like the instructor focuses on the whole body, which is often lacking from other workouts. i got a good sweat going, felt relaxed afterwards and definitely worked the whole body. as far as instruction, great! very thorough in explaining each move and i didn't feel lost like other videos. highly recommended.",1088640000,3,375,4.7846153846153845
1848194,2,B00008IP4U,"First of all, this DVD does not use any of the inherent advantages of DVDs at all:  i.e., chapters, different workouts, and special features
Having said that, while this DVD does emphasize more aggressive or challenging postures, in the end, it offers nothing whatsoever over any of the other many Yoga DVDs.  The workout is much too short as anyone that has practiced for a while will notice.
The instructor is great, not preachy, and the music is tolerable, but instead look at any of the Yoga Journal or Yoga for EveryBody DVDs.",1078876800,5,531,4.698924731182796
1848195,4,B00008IP4U,"This is a quite good power yoga workout, it's pretty different from most power yoga and adds some new moves into it which was very good and challenging at times, some of the moves reminded me a little bit of pilates exercises but after all pilates was influenced by yoga, it's about 1 hour long.",1078531200,,295,4.381818181818182
1848196,5,B00008IP4U,"First, I have to reinforce what a previous reviewer said--this CD is a great value for what you get.  I used to do a little yoga years ago but was having trouble getting back into it.  I really like this routine--it is a good mixture of easy and challenging poses.  The music might bug you at first like another reviewer said, but if you open yourself up to it it actually becomes a great accompaninment.  My wife was making fun of Kurt's style but I have warmed up to him and like the pace and mix of his routine.  I am always looking forward to repeating.  I am glad I had some yoga background because I already know proper position and tilt but if you lack that background you will want to combine this video with some background reading or some real instruction.  I live way out in the country and I like that this DVD makes you feel like you are part of the class.  I will want to try some other DVDs or CDs in the future but I really like this one.",1074729600,,954,4.118918918918919
1848197,5,B00008IP4U,"This is a great DVD that leaves me feeling strong and energized.  It's a bit slow for me in the beginning as he sets up the breathing, but definitely delivers heat and a solid upper body workout once you get through that.  The music is decent and the instructor is not annoying.  The workout runs for about an hour - enough to feel complete.  I have tried a lot of routines and this one continues to be a staple in my schedule.  You may also like Power Yoga for Strength and Endurance by Yoga Zone.",1072051200,,498,4.2
1848198,4,B00008IP4U,"First of all, this disc is a great deal and I would recommend it to anyone who likes power yoga.  It has a lot of great strength-building movements for the upper body and some for the lower body as well.  It definitely delivers what it says it will.  I only have two complaints: first, the disc lacks all of my favorite body-opening poses, namely the triangle series and the hip-opening poses like pigeon pose.  I find that as a result I don't feel as energized, loose, balanced and strong as when I do one of Bryan Kest's or Baron Baptiste's sessions.  Second, and this is only aesthetic, the teacher's manner may get on your nerves.  To me that is a minor problem and the I would definitely recommend the disc.",1065830400,,712,4.438461538461539
1848199,5,B00008IP4U,"I order this DVD 5 months ago.  It is a great, focused workout that takes the practitioner through every part of their body, using a calm rhythmic breathing technique to link the body and the mind.  The workout is great for experienced practitioners as well as the beginner because modifications are offered in each pose.  So as your become more proficient in your practice this DVD still has a very challenging workout unlike other DVDs which do not always offer modifications.  I even used the DVD with an injury and used the modifications to be compassionate with my injury but continue to practice. The music that accompained the practice was a great addition.  I cannot wait for other DVDs from this yoga studio.",1062633600,5,717,4.796747967479675
1848200,4,B00008IP4U,"I ordered this DVD based upon the reviews. It was definitely a good work out. That I do have to say. But, what was strange was the other participants in the class didn't engage with the teacher at all. They were ""zoned"" out in my opinion. They never looked at the teacher, cracked a smile, or showed any emotion. I like to see someone having a good time in the class. It encourages me to push myself. The ethnic drum beats and breathing sounds were distracting when working out. I use it for the workout and it is a challenge.",1060214400,2,526,4.27
1848201,5,B00008IP4U,"This is one of my new favorites!  It's easy to follow and great for building strength, particularly in the shoulders and back.  I love that you do not have to be a pretzel to do this routine and that it lasts for about an hour (so many videos have only 30 minute workouts).  This is a must have for your collection!",1057276800,4,315,4.131147540983607
7984568,5,B00008IP4U,So glad I found this. My favorite yoga instructor. Miss his show.,1520380800,,65,4.5

7984571,1,B00008IP4U,"Unfortunately, this earlier version of Kurt Johnson's yoga session is a big disappointment. It certainly was not worth the inflated  price of $42 because only a few copies are available (original list price was $12.95). Viewers are better off watching his newer, more effective, but not-readily-available-on-DVD yoga sessions on YouTube videos.",1455321600,,344,5.745098039215686
7984572,4,B00008IP4U,"I like Kurt Johnson and this is a good workout.  Not for a beginner, some challenging poses and an arm balance.  I use it to supplement my in studio yoga classes.",1318464000,,162,4.193548387096774
7984573,5,B00008IP4U,I began seeing Kurt Johnsen on the Veria channel once I switched from cable to Dish network(Veria is the best thing about the switch). I love his Yoga to Go class except the constant commercials every five minutes so I looked for a full length yoga class and purchased it here. It is one great yoga workout and is very challenging I would like to see if he has any more.,1216598400,2,370,4.225352112676056
7984574,4,B00008IP4U,"As the other reviewers have mentioned, this is an excellent, strength-building workout.  It includes good upper-body and ab work in addition to the standard warrior poses, and all in all seems to be a very well balanced and carefully thought out routine.  The poses are held long enough that you really feel them, and the transitions are natural and not rushed.  It's one of my favorite yoga workouts.  The instructor is a complete twit, however.  For the record, word ""yoga"" does not come from the old English meaning ""to yoke or link.""  He actually says this!  And much of the rubbish that comes out of his mouth consists of half-digested phrases from Brian Kest.  For example, ""not buying into the ebb and flow of life,"" and ""calmness in a difficult situation.""  I don't mind when the spirituality behind yoga is sincere and thoughtful, but this guy just spouts a lot of gibberish.  So if you can tune out the instructor, it's a DVD worth adding to you collection.",1152921600,3,967,4.7023809523809526
7984575,5,B00008IP4U,"This video and Seane Corn's 'Vinyasa Flow Yoga' are by and far the best fitness tapes I've ever seen. I break a sweat halfway through APY - Strength, and it never fails to challenge and encourage me to push myself farther than before. Yet, at the same time, if I'm tired or sick or stressed, APY is a fantastic moving meditation. Great for newbies as they provide multiple modifications to the asanas (poses), but advanced enough for more experienced practitioners if you watch your form. I adore it!",1138665600,2,500,4.693181818181818
7984576,4,B00008IP4U,"This is a little over a 50 minute workout, inside a yoga studio with a medium-sized class of non-instructors.  The actual workout is very, very similar to Brian Kest's Power Yoga workout series in its difficulty level (Intermediate-ish) and the duration.  He even uses some of the same terms and the same cues as Brian Kest, although he has his own touches and like someone else wrote you don't get the triangle series or back openers-- but it's a nice workout and it gives you something different from his own background.  It's not great for beginners b/c there isn't that type of basic instruction, and yogis who are looking for more vigorous 1 1/2 hour workouts won't have that here but this is great for a slow day when you don't have time for that but want to get moving (just like how you can use Baron Baptiste or Kest).  I enjoyed the workout very much, the DVD doesn't have any extra bells and whistles or any beautiful location, and Kest is better but it's like having another Brian Kest workout in the collection for a good price. I enjoyed the instructor who I find kind of soothing, and I do like the personal story of the instructor and his sister on the insert, who are using yoga to get through a personal tragedy.  It's a sincere class, not a rip off like some I've bought, and not one of the many DVD series with a great, skilled instructor and gorgeous scenery whose DVD and video classes unfortunately never, ever go beyond a beginner level.",1133913600,11,1461,4.49811320754717
7984577,5,B00008IP4U,"I have been doing yoga for a few years, and I have taken classes from this actual instructor...with results.  This was at first a great supplement to my attendance at classes but since I moved, I have relied on this dvd as my only source of yoga, since I cannot find an instructor/class I liked as much.  I am an injury-prone runner and do these tapes in my off days which helps me loosen up as well as build strength.  I do think that taking a few classes at a studio helps one get the most out of the dvd...but think beginners would like it too!  This can be as hard or easy as you want it to be.",1104710400,2,598,4.0
