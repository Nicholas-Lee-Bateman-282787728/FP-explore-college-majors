1754432,5,B00006G8P0,"This was a cute movie mostly because the characters had chemistry & were both cute to look at. I loved Allen Payne's roll as the down south country boy (like in Jason's Lyric) and the romantic idea of being swept off your feet by a ""southern gentleman!"" (ha!) I probably watch this movie twice a month when I need a romantic escapel",1089072000,7,332,4.370967741935484
1754433,5,B00006G8P0,What a superby Love Story with a happy ending.  It takes a drastic move in one's life to recognise what is important and this came across in the movie.  I will be watching this DVD time and again.,1051660800,9,196,4.131578947368421
1754434,5,B00006G8P0,"I first saw this video on BET a while back, and loved it. When it came out on video, I didn't get it until I could and now watch it whenever I want to. You have this woman who is a stockbroker with no other life, who has a heart attack and told to go recuperate, which she does to a lady who used to take care of her down in North Carolina, and she ends up meeting her nephew, who is renovating her home. At first, there is no common interest, but as time go on, they fall for each other, and know that something has to give. I won't give up all the details, but check it out.",1047254400,,576,3.808333333333333

1754465,4,B00006G8P0,"This movie is my guilty pleasure.  Love it to pieces.  I've had the DVD for quite some time and after seeing seeing the prices on here, so glad I bought it when I did.  Two complaints -- I thought Van and Fox fell in love way too fast.  But, I guess time constraints were a consideration.  Also, the southern accents seem to come and go and when they came, they were not believable.  Other than that, great movie.  Excellent plot line.  The story was very believable.  Would highly recommend.",1407456000,,492,4.438202247191011

1754480,5,B00006G8P0,"When I saw Ms. Dillard in this movie I thought who will they get to star opposite her - but the pairing is such a perfect match!!!
both of them do well at being the best the ""other"" never had....an uptown girl seemingly could never fall for a downtown guy until she meets her match, oh boy what a match; he is so hot in this movie!! makes me wish I was there!!!
great performances by both of these; then there are veteran performers on board as well who round out the cast and make this a memorable film....I have watched it several times....cuz it makes me cry!!!",1386201600,,564,4.231481481481482

1754482,5,B00006G8P0,"Okay, so it was a pretty good film. Great story, but in my opinion this is still a low budget movie. Amazon clearly  should not allow sellers to sell this movie for more than 15.00 dollars brand new. Its damn near 15-20 years old!#ridiculous #notworth30.00",1375747200,,256,4.688888888888889

1754484,1,B00006G8P0,"This was a movie I've been wanting to see for ever however, when i received the movie it didn't play well. The movie itself kept freezing in the dvd player I tried to clean it off, but the movie kept freezing up. Makes me leary about buying pre-owned movies.",1366761600,,258,4.285714285714286

1754487,5,B00006G8P0,"This is a sweet love story that explores how two seemingly incompatible people realize they have more in common than they think. Watching their relationship evolve was fun. The movie had a lot of underlying themes, but the theme I left with was that Romance is still alive and well.  You can have romance WITHOUT it always leading to hitting the sheets.  Allen Payne's character, Van truly romanced Fox (Victoria Dillard) and showed there was more to him than just his physical appearance(although it was great to watch).  It's wonderful seeing that quality in a man, we don't have enough that in our society. I'm glad I purchased this movie. All the characters were fun to watch and did their thing.",1295740800,,700,4.768595041322314

1754500,5,B00006G8P0,I love this movie. the actors are my favorite. the movie reminded me of people helping eachother in times of crisis. It makes me crave to go back home to North Carolina.,1268179200,,169,4.3125
1754501,5,B00006G8P0,"Fox Giovanni who is a hardworking; overly competitive stockbroker who thinks money is the most important thing in life. Her health suffers from that and she ends up having to take time off and spend time away from the hustle and bustle of New York City. She heads south to reconnect with her estranged foster mother, finds out something about family and true love. She ends up falling in love with Van. It's really a good love story about two people who really don't want to be in love, but it's kind of forced on them. It's a situation that neither one of them want to have that experience of being vulnerable or in love. This movie is great. It's an enjoyable romance with relatable characters that made it easy for me to get into the story. There were even random bits of comedy, so it's enjoyable. The book is even better.  I recommend this movie to anyone.",1267228800,,861,4.449367088607595

1754505,4,B00006G8P0,"This movie was a delight.  First, you get to see actors that mainstream cinema passes by often.  The storyline was completely believable.  I believe that the movie would appeal to 30 and over crowd.  The situations and content would be better understood by those who are in the between generation.  Still young enough for changes, but old enough to appreciate the wisdom in times gone by.  A must see.",1141948800,6,401,4.739130434782608
1754506,5,B00006G8P0,"I find the movie to be delightful.. As a city girl who recently moved back to the south.  I seen myself potrayed in the movie.. I was a reminder of what coming ""home"" back to the south really means.. good food. good friends.  slow country days. and a big dose of ""mother's wit..small town..goodness.

1754508,3,B00006G8P0,"i don't like that it wasn't rated. does that mean its too inappropriate to be even a rated r? its from bet so it should be rated r. it doesnt say the running time so it makes you feel like it never ends. and it doesnt say if its widescreen or full screen. of course that gets you to pop it in the dvd player and obviously its full screen. full screen is better but thats just dumb. so was it a good movie? sure, but i don't think i will keep it.",1116720000,,445,3.795698924731183
1754509,4,B00006G8P0,"I just wanted to say that this story was wondeful. The characters seem to work very well together and the chemistry was hot. I do feel that there relationship was alittle rushed, but I understand because the movie can only last but so long. Aunt Willow was very funny and the woman who played her did a great job. This has to be one of BET's better films and I hope they keep them coming.",1094169600,15,388,4.1866666666666665

will be a part 2 some day.  These seasoned stars made my day in the viewing of this movie. Absolutely love it.

It reminds us to never settle, but remain of good faith, because the right one is definitely out there : )

7968413,5,B00006G8P0,"Wonderful movie. I saw it many years ago on BET and never forgot it.  Fox goes to spend time with her foster mom, Willow, after suffering a heart attack. While there, she meets Willow's nephew, Van. They keep coming into contact with each other and start falling in love. I really like this movie because the love story is a slow burn as the sexual tension between the two builds slowly. The characters spend time sharing moments of bonding (without sex) that to me were intimate and romantic. They eventually make love and you can clearly see that they were making love not having sex. A big bonus for me is that there are no curse words or gang violence. There is a small subplot but it's low-angst and an we get an HEA. Totally recommend it for any hopeless romantics out there.",1487462400,3,781,4.461538461538462
