8448328,5,B000GAKOFA,I found this DVD to very useful.  The instructor came across as knowledgeable.  the moves are not difficult but are challenging.  It is a no frills dvd that gets the point across.  I own the the tai chi videos from the series and hope that they continue putting out more.,1311724800,2,271,4.36
