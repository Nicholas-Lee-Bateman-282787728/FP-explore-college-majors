4487861,5,B004WO9OKW,"If you have ever struggled with forgiveness toward someone, you need to see this movie. Amazing what God can do in people's lives when they seek to be obedient with forgiveness. It's all about reaching the lost with the love of Christ.

Be prepared to be moved.

Hats off to Skip Moody, Len O'Donnell, and Dean Smith. Awesome job guys!",1312502400,9,335,4.566666666666666
4487903,5,B004WO9OKW,"EXCELLENT account on what forgiveness is suppose to be according to scripture. I have purchased over 50 of these DVD's to give out. We all need to know how to forgive just as Jesus told the disciples, Matthew 6:14-15 14 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: 15 but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.",1421539200,2,400,4.728571428571429
4487904,2,B004WO9OKW,"This is a documentary.  It's slow moving and boring.
I watched it for 45 minutes, hoping to see something interesting, but I finally had to shut it off, because the film
just went on and on.
Forgiving others is essential for a Christian, but this documentary had nothing to catch my interest.
I do not recommend this film.",1409184000,,322,4.551724137931035
4487905,5,B004WO9OKW,"Dean's journey to forgiveness is a compelling story that begins with all the elements of those favorite TV dramas that demonstrate ""man's inhumanity to man"". Most of us will never experience the pain of having their mother murdered, much less by the man she called husband and Dean called step-father.  But out of this horror and pain we follow Dean as he explores all the feelings that will lead him out of the darkness of anger and into the light of forgiveness, reminding all of us of the power we have been given and all we can accomplish when we put that power to good use.

Don't miss this one!",1362009600,,600,4.445454545454545
4487906,5,B004WO9OKW,"""Love your enemies, do good to them and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because He is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. Be merciful just as your Father is merciful.""  Luke 6:35-36

Learn to forgive.",1354060800,3,295,4.444444444444445
4487907,5,B004WO9OKW,This movie will show you that truly all things are possible through God and that all you have to do is have a willing heart. Extremely well done!  Inspiring and touching!  Loved it!,1341014400,5,181,4.454545454545454
4487908,5,B004WO9OKW,"A tale full of fascinating characters and organized in a way that keeps the viewer riveted from beginning to end.  The movie has a strong spiritual element as that is such a large part of what brings the main character out of his darkness, but it somehow still manages to not feel ""preachy"".  Anybody who watches this is bound to, regardless of their own beliefs, be compelled to revisit their feelings towards those who have hurt them in the past.  My wife and I watched it and were blown away.",1323388800,8,495,4.477777777777778
4487909,5,B004WO9OKW,"This is one of those things you just walk away different from! During the movie I just kept thinking about how privileged I felt to be viewing the raw footage in front of me. For someone to share those moments, those parts of their life with you....ALL so that God can have the glory he deserves in a testimony like Dean's is a blessing beyond measure. I have seen it twice and plan on watching it plenty more!! This has really given me encouragement with my own faith and re-assuring all God plans to do in my life. Thanks Live to Forgive for sharing your hearts with us!",1323302400,6,572,4.305555555555555
4487910,5,B004WO9OKW,"This is one of the most amazing stories I've ever heard.  I saw this at the San Antonio Independent Christian Film Festival last year and have been waiting for it to become available.  The next time someone says to me, ""Prove to me that there is a God,"" I will give them this movie.  There is no reason on earth for this level of forgiveness.  Truly incredible.",1323216000,13,361,4.343283582089552
4487911,5,B004WO9OKW,"This movie is dear to my heart for many reasons. We love you mom. I love you Dean for opening my eyes to God. This movie will change your life be it big or small. It is truely amazing what forgiveness can do for the soul, mind and spirit. Mom, this ones for you. Love, Gienna",1323216000,7,275,3.9285714285714284
4487912,5,B004WO9OKW,"This movie will move you to tears at the very least. I never considered myself a practicing christian, but this movie made me want to feel the love and compassion that God has for us ALL. Because of Deans story I have been going to church with my family and I have opened my heart to the love that God has for me! You will not be disappointed.",1323216000,15,343,4.0588235294117645
