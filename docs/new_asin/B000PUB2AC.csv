2828306,5,B000PUB2AC,I thoroughly enjoyed this lecture series.  Susan Sarandon is an informative and dynamic host.,1197331200,10,93,5.642857142857143

2828308,5,B000PUB2AC,"For anyone who loves Joseph Campbell this DVD will be a must have addition to your collection. Campbell explains the similarities between all world religions skillfully and shows the underlying themes that connect us all. In the face of this our petty world squabbles seem infantile. This should be taught in every school, but until that day comes I will simply teach it here in my home. I am sure we will be all the better for for it. This is, for now, secret knowledge. Hopefully as time goes on more and more people will stumble upon it and his ideas will become familiar to more of us. His other books, DVDs, and audio CDs are all worth looking into or buying. Many of his ideas stem from concepts Jung theorized. Campbell takes much of it further and is easier to read. Jung often goes off the deep end and loses his way. Campbell is wholly consistent and weaves an intricate web of understanding for anyone who cares to grow. His works, besides bringing greater understanding to us about the world we live in and the conscious world we inhabit, can also be used to further help inspire and lead with mythological writing. I myself love to write fiction and have found his works invaluable beyond anything else. George Lucas used his book ""The Hero With a Thousand Faces"" to help him write Star Wars. It is no secret why the films resonate so well all around the world as a result. The underlying themes can be unlocked through reading Campbell's works.",1193011200,71,1458,4.568702290076335
2828309,5,B000PUB2AC,"It is no secret the impact Joesph Campbell's work had on his listeners. He was an artistic storyteller; a talent revered and required. Through MYTHOS I Campbell begins to weave all religions/philosophies together in order to provide the viewer not with instruction, but with doorways to discover their own spiritualism. As Mark Twain consistently directed; everyone should develop his or her own religion. Through MYTHOS I & II the viewer is walked through many philosophies, their development and how to develop one's own. Thought stimuli are vital to human spiritual development and Mr. Campbell provided the tour through space and time. Not once does he impose his informative lectures, but instead opens the flower of possibilities one petal at a time. For me it was Campbell's books that spontaneously combusted my spiritual catharsis. In conjunction with a plethora of writers and artists I methodically developed through fiction not ""The Hero With a Thousand Faces"" but The HEROINE with multiple countenances through my 4 novels guaranteed to charge a new and improved attitude:

2828310,2,B000PUB2AC,"I've bought this DVD JUST BECAUSE it was writen at its Product Detais it has CC - Closed Captions.

But despite have tried it in three different DVD players, and in four different TV sets, all of then with Closed Captions facility/function, NONE recognized or enabled this usefull feature.

Does anyone there knows how to enable this? Or it really doesn't have CC and the marketing just made fool of me???

Thanks for any help.

2828311,3,B000PUB2AC,"It was with cautious optimism that I (thankfully) checked this title out from my local library.  I was disappointed within minutes with material which had little or nothing to do with the lectures: namely the narrator.  It was sufficiently distracting to deal with her that I downgraded the overall score due to her performance.  My thanks go to the other reviewers who corroborated this sensation.

That being said, the material presented by Campbell himself was engaging, approachable and very intriguing.  It may be a big bite for a new viewer to take on, but it's a digestible one and anyone interested in the ""Ologies"" (psych, myth, anthropo, and socio) will find a great blending of these fields, which is no small part of his appeal.",1295395200,17,740,4.888
2828312,5,B000PUB2AC,"What are we all looking for?  What do you call that thing sought after by science, religion  and everything in between? And, why is it so illusive? When a friend recommended Joseph Campbells' book ""the hero with a thousand faces"", I knew from the title that it may be the book I was looking for because for years I had been noticing the similarities between the religions and the myths of the world which led me to believe that everyone everywhere is reaching for the same thing.  After being blown away the the book mentioned above, I got Mythos 1.  Since this DVD is over four and a half hours long, I was looking forward to watching it over a couple of weeks, a little at a time.  Well, I watched half the first night, slept, woke up and watched the rest. Joseph Campbell is off the hook!

Whenever I consider taking in the views of any scholar, it matters a great deal to me the impression that I get of the type of person that he or she is.  Is the motivation self aggrandizement, malice, concern for others?  J.C. definitely falls into the third category.  His compassion for humanity is extremely apparent and his main objective seems to be to demonstrate to all who will hear it that we are and have always been connected as one human group.  There are no ""others"", just us.  In subtle ways, he informs us that we each share a common mission: to draw upward, not tear down those around us, but in order to do so we must first take a journey to find a treasure that we must acquire in order to be of any assistance to others.

So as we venture out into the great unknown, what is it that we are seeking and, again, why is it so illusive?  I guess the paradox is that the only way to find it is by looking outside your circle only to discover it within yourself.  The treasure that we seek is found in humanity; it is one that has to be lost in order to be found. If we step outside of who we think we are, we find ourselves.  And, if you find the Self, you are fit to help humanity; if you help humanity, you help yourself.  This message is whispered in the works of Joseph Campbell.",1281052800,11,2090,4.21356783919598
2828313,2,B000PUB2AC,"I'm going to attempt to find all the tapes and a vhs player somewhere b/c for some reason anyone who wants to watch there beloved Joseph Campbell also has to be subjected to an unbelievably large amount of Susan Surandans melodrama. I don't know, it just seems like this cheapens and patronizes everything his work means. Yeah it's deep, I don't need some jerk popping up every 8 minutes to tell me so. This series would be 100 times less annoying if it was narrated by that Mattress Max idiot. I'd rather fill Susan Surrandans countless interuptions with brief segments from the Tyra Banks show. There is not much worse than this. It's truly awful. It's like a McDonalds in the rainforest. It is the devils work. There had to be money involved. I don't want to watch some random person feel good about dumming down someone elses work. I don't want to see her smug expressions everytime she stops talking. 'Oh my, I said that perfectly and with such believability and conviction. I really believed I knew what I was talking about.' I absolutely hate this. It just needs to be switched around a little bit. Is Bill Moyers still alive or anyone who's not a total moron who can renarate and not constantly interupt. Someone please make another version of this. Peter Jackson, you put out LOTR like two years after I read it. That was great, got time for a really small side project? Just cut her out. For CHRIST SAKE SOMEONE GET RID OF HER FOOTAGE AND PUT JOSEPH CAMPBELLS MUTILATED TAPES BACK TOGETHER!!! It's not Humpty Dumpty or even close to rocket science. Somebody just do it. Take 35 minutes a day for the better half of a week and remaster it, call your ppl and have them remake this without this horrible egotistical person and without interuptions. PLEASE!!!",1274227200,25,1765,4.624203821656051
2828314,4,B000PUB2AC,Joseph Campbell is brilliant. Every sentence he utters should be pondered for hours. This video is great except for the awful narration by Susan Sarandan. There you hanging on Joseph's every word then SMACK and it cuts to Susan and some rediculous monologue. That pretentious cretan ruins the whole series. Thanks a lot!,1250726400,18,320,5.056603773584905
2828315,5,B000PUB2AC,"Buckle up for an extraordinary ride to the past, where customs and religious practices are not as arcane as we once thought them to be. Joseph Campbell takes us on a journey to meet the ancient gods of our ancestors and shows us how they metamorphosed into the gods of today.  This is a wonderful series of lectures, illustrating common themes and motifs running throughout cultural and religious beliefs. In the final lecture, Campbell has the chutzpah to draw some fairly obvious but controversial conclusions, to which not everyone in the audience agrees. Some people still prefer to live in blind faith, but for those who are willing to take off the blinkers, this is a must see DVD.",1215993600,24,687,4.773109243697479
2828316,5,B000PUB2AC,"This fortunate product constitutes one half of the former Mythos. You will also need Mythos 2 in order to have the complete work. This is OK; in fact good news, as the original Mythos--now out of production--is expensive if you find it, Mythos 1 is not.

The content in this series is vital if you are looking for genuine insight into the human experience. Quite possibly the answers to solving many of society's/culture's/civilization's fundamental dilemmas may be peiced together from this knowledge herein. As the phenomenon of progress continues to change human life universally, there are many forgotten basic principals and truths to living life in harmony with itself that do not change. They are forgotten but not lost and you may find some in Mythos 1.

2828317,5,B000PUB2AC,This is a must for Campbells students of mythology. He enlightens us with ancient wisdom once again.,1212537600,3,100,4.9411764705882355
2828318,5,B000PUB2AC,"This DVD is a Campbell resource that is meaty, enjoyable, and delightful. For those of us who, like George Lucas, consider Joseph Campbell our ""Yoda,"" an entire series of lectures is like finding the Mother Lode. My only complaint about this DVD is the fact that it is Mythos I and I am trying to find the entire set!

It is my understanding that approximately 50 hours of Campbell video exists and I, for one, would like to see every scrap of it. The more complex the world becomes, the more cogent and significant are the lectures of Joseph Campbell. Please offer more. I would happily buy the entire set. I have watched Mythos I half a dozen times. Like Carl Sagan's Cosmos, this is a timeless, pertinent, important contribution to those searching for truth and meaning in an upside-down world.",1206662400,31,797,4.652482269503546

8193426,5,B000PUB2AC,"We will have no more of his enlightened words to shake us into understanding that we may be living our life from the traditions of the family and beliefs of others instead of our own true beliefs.  Thank goodness we will always have his written words to inspire and probe those deep places within and awaken our true creative spirit and thrive.
Read his works knowing that you have been spoken to by one of the greatest minds of all times.

8193427,4,B000PUB2AC,"Don't like Susan Sarandon as a moderator-- she adds nothing. All you really want to see and hear is Campbell, but the best of his stuff is not yet out on DVD--Transformations of Myth Thru Time. It was a best seller on VHS, but I don't know what the holdup is.",1400803200,,259,4.098039215686274

8193430,5,B000PUB2AC,Joseph Campbell lays out the truth for all to see. He makes sense of historical events and ties them to our belief systems. For the thinking man.,1373155200,,145,4.407407407407407
8193431,5,B000PUB2AC,I am in awe of the level of information this beautiful man had stored in his brain.

8193433,4,B000PUB2AC,"I am not going to go into detail. The other reviews are sufficient. I am very pleased to have these  excellent reproductions of Mr Campbell's lectures. Thank you to the Foundation and all who put these discs together.

The only flaw, as I see it, is the use of Susan Sarando as narrator. Two items stick out in my mind: she should learn how to pronounce ""Jung."" And she should refer to Mr Campbell as such not as ""Joe or Campbell.""

This woman spoils the theme of the seminars because she apparently knows very little about Mythology. In addition, she apparently thinks that she is on the same level as Mr. Campbell.

 Why is she sitting curled up on a chair? Doesn't she know how to sit in a chair?

Susan Sarando is the reason I rated these wonderful seminars as four.

Thank you Amazon for carrying Joseph Campbell's material. I had all of his books, but they were destroyed in the September, 2011 flood in New York. I plan to purchase additional DVDs of Mr Campbell's lectures.

My apology to Warehouse Deals, the seller of this disc. Thank you for your speedy delivery--one day early. The  condition of the discs is perfect.",1347235200,2,1129,4.522167487684729
8193434,5,B000PUB2AC,"The Mythos series is one of the better Joseph Campbell DVDs I've watched. It's simply him presenting a lecture, but that's as it should be. And what a great lecturer he is. He manages to engage you as a viewer even though you're not in the room with him. He exudes a passion and joy for his subject. Campbell also presents his material in a methodical order, going from Western to Eastern traditions. This allows him to present his work - including controversial views - as he sees fit, not as some interviewer asks him.

This series is ""hosted"" by Susan Sarandon, and while her comments aren't particularly informative or useful they're few and far between. 90-95% of each episode is Joseph Campbell with no other voices. I suspect Sarandon was thrown in because some marketing exec thought it would appeal to ""dumb Americans.""",1332633600,5,828,4.75
