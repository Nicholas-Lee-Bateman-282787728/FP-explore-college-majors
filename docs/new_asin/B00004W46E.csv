1360168,3,B00004W46E,I purchased this for my nephews birthday. He loves old cartoons just like me and my brother watched when we were little. This is a great example of old cartoons my nephew loves it.,1125532800,2,180,4.323529411764706
1360169,1,B00004W46E,"Let me start by saying that I greatly enjoyed the original Casper movie that preceded this one.  I have watched it countless times and both my kids (age 6 and age 4) love it.  As such, I had high hopes for this particular movie, but should have followed my instincts when I saw that it was a fully animated film.  After only 10 minutes, my daughter kept asking me if/when the movie was over, and I had to painfully sit through the next hour and 13 minutes to see it through the end.  Wimpy story line, mediocre animation, horrible humor, extremely annoying characters, a complete and total disaster.  Not worth the recyclable material that it is made out of.",1070496000,14,658,4.495798319327731
1360170,3,B00004W46E,"Storywise it wasn't bad. It was kind of nice to see a new Casper Movie especially with Spooky and Poil in it. If It wasn't for the fact that it was done entirely with Computer Graphics Interactive I think it would have rated a little higher. The CGI bit though took away from it especially since Casper, Casper a Spirited Beginning, and Casper Meets Wendy were all Live Action. I have a feeling that everything could have been done Live Action",975283200,8,443,4.481481481481482

1360216,4,B00004W46E,"I did spent the whole hour of watching Casper's cartoon.  The graphic and the story line were good.  Good for children and young adults to watch.
The story is about a family and a little girl who has loving spirit of Christmas and is not afraid of the haunting ghosts. Casper found a way to stop the haunting ghosts from making things worst.  One has to watch the whole story to fimd out why the title is named Casper's Haunted Christmas.",1471392000,,438,4.382716049382716

1360345,2,B00004W46E,The graphics are okay. Casper is a nice ghost (as usual) but there's too much negativity and bullying from the other ghost characters. I think this might be okay for older kids (maybe 9 and up?). I didn't like it for my son who is just over 2 (he saw the ghost and wanted to watch it).,1457740800,,285,4.017543859649122

1360358,3,B00004W46E,I just could not get interested in this but I think a lot of it is because the Casper was too modern for me. I grew up with the early animated Casper and never meshed this one to my view. I did not watch the whole movie I am sure others loved this movie. If you don't remember the original Casper you will enjoy this movie though.,1455580800,,330,3.9402985074626864

1360696,1,B00004W46E,"I have to confess that I was not able to finish watching this pitiful excuse for a movie, it was that painful.  I knew I was in trouble when I got 20 minutes into this supposed ""Christmas"" movie with absolutely no references to Christmas. The ""plot"", as it is, involves Casper being forced to scare someone or else a demonic being will condemn him and his uncles.  Yes, very Christmas-y.  I can't tell you how it ends, but I hope it ends with Casper failing and all of the characters in this film suffering a horrible fate.
The computer animation is so poor and so outdated it looks like it was rendered on an IBM Pentium I.  There are actual instances of slow-down and frame loss and all other kinds of video artifacts that I never see in any other video I stream.  The voice acting is the only thing about this film that seems professional, but the script is so abysmal that the actors can't save it.
