6426683,5,B00KH57URE,I have loved Ranma 1/2 ever since I first saw it way back when and have loved it ever since. I was extremely excited when I learned the series was coming out on Blu-ray and had to order the sets for myself so that I could re-live every memorable moment. I'm now waiting for Ranma 1/2: TV Series Set 4 to release and arrive (I already have it pre-ordered) :),1413763200,3,357,4.114285714285714

6426685,5,B00KH57URE,"I used to love Ranma 1/2, and it was back in the days when you'd pay $20-25 for three episodes on a VHS tape.  This Blu-Ray collection is a fantastic re-do in a lot of ways.  The original material has been very well cleaned up, you get a LOT more episodes for your dollar (22), and each flows properly with the opening and ending credits and commercial-break animations still kept in their proper place.

I loved the fact that some Japanese sequences that were never translated were added in.  Where we used to have to hunt to find dubbed versus subtitled, this Blu-ray collection will not only do English or Japanese, you can also choose if you want subtitles for just the written words, dialogue, or both.

Since this still isn't enough, you get a colorful piece of art, printed on card stock (in this set a picture of Ryoga) plus a booklet that starts with a ""The story so far"" synopsis, then sums up each episode and also includes a thumbnail image of each.

If you're new to the series, you should begin with Set 1 - it's worth the journey that builds up the story.  This is one of my favorite anime/manga titles of all time and this Blu-ray is a great rework of the original.",1413676800,10,1181,4.389908256880734
6426686,5,B00KH57URE,"Great series. Currently reading the manga and i'm loving it more, but the anime is still great!",1412467200,,95,4.647058823529412
6426687,5,B00KH57URE,"I love all the characters in Ranma 1/2.  Ryoga, Shampoo, Kodachi and the like.  It's not as hard hitting as the anime ""Hell Girl"" which is a must see; but, Ranma 1/2 is a lot of fun.

6426708,4,B00KH57URE,"Although I love the first two seasons I do have a couple problems with season three, but that's only for the English dub.  For starters, the English voice actor for Ranma changes halfway through this season.  Secondly, I really don't like the Hawaiian principle who has an Jamaican accent.  I just don't understand why he has a Jamaican accent when he is Hawaiian.  He's just super annoying, and feels only like filler content.

On the other hand the Japanese audio gets 5 stars, and deserves to be in your collection, especially if you own the first two sets.

Ranma : Set 3 does have a complete restoration with a frame rate of 4:3, and is presented in 1080p with an English and Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 tracks.  The special limited edition set includes a premium chipboard artbox, full color art card, and 32-page episode summary booklet.

You would have to do two things. 1) Get the original series before Warner Bros broght the rights or 2) Get a better blu-ray player that can up-convert to full wide screen. Other than that, the picture and sound quality wonderful.",1505433600,,401,4.2894736842105265
8658690,5,B00KH57URE,ok back then I touched back at myself owning 2 seasons of Ranma 1/2 DVDS and now I have finally owned Ranma 1/2 set 3 because I have owned about three seasons of Ranma 1/2 which is the third season of Ranma 1/2 I have ever watched both at home and even on the computer every time I have to go to the library because I have been half way reading my library book at the time was the book Transformer the complete Lou Reed story biography book during the summer last year and I have finally made myself become an otaku ever since I have watched anime movies during Christmas time in 2015 was the anime movies such as Lupin the Third: The Castle of Cagliostro and Katsuhiro Otomo's cult hit anime film based on the phone book length manga of all time is the anime film Akira and so I bet have watched about three seasons of Ranma 1/2 during the summer last year.,1493856000,,858,4.174698795180723
8658691,4,B00KH57URE,"I got this set at a good price and used a $50 giftcode from mypoints.com to pay for it. As advertised, the set comes in a stiff cardboard art box, which contains a bluray case with 23 episodes of Ranma remastered on 3 blurays. The box also contains an art card and a booklet with summaries of the 23 episodes included in the set. These episodes are in the original order so you can follow the story as it was meant to unfold. Video and audio quality are excellent, and the video is in the original 4:3 ratio, meaning you will see bars if you have a typical modern widescreen television. This is normal and not a mistake. I watched the discs on a 50"" LED tv and had no issues with either video or audio.",1489363200,,702,4.169117647058823
