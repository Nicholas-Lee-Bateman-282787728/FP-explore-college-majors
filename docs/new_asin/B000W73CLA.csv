You have to chuckle at the antics of these women especially the woman who gets all her sex information from a book.
The scene where she and Byung finally get together is both funny and beautiful.  I highly recommend this movie especially if you are a Lee Byung Hun fan as I am. Byung Hun is so great in action movies but he proves here he certainly can play comedy as well.",1295654400,,537,4.037735849056604
8475028,1,B000W73CLA,"Having watched many Korean movies and dramas, I am a big fan of the genre.  The acting, the camera work, the music are usually first rate.  Sometimes the plots leave something to be desired.

This film is one of those with an inane plot, a complete fantasy, which treats its female stars as objects, and paints them as well, quite frankly, not as smart as the male lead.  The plot was bad, the acting bad, and if it was not for Choi Ji Woo, who is wonderful to look at, and a marvelous actress, I wouldn't give it any stars at all.  For her, I give it one star.",1274486400,,561,4.110091743119266
8475029,5,B000W73CLA,"Lee Byung Hun was and is the best in action movies. But after so many movies, and so much violent. It was so refreshing to see that he's also the best with comedy movies. So funny, so sexy, and so so handsome. This's a movies that you must see, and owned. Because you would want to watches it again and again. Especially when some friends come over. Everybody loves Everybody Has Secrets.",1190419200,,388,4.402777777777778
8475030,4,B000W73CLA,"A great film with a very interesting plot.  The good points are: A very talented (not to mention great looking) cast, solid laughs, a non-silly witty script, fantastically written characters, and the film has a nice look to it.  Why only 4 stars you ask?  Well at first glance, the films plot seems ever changing and intricate, which it is, but if you truly think about what is going on by the end, nothing like this would ever be possible in real life.  Also, the first ending is a little weak, but lucky for it there is a second ending that saves the film.",1152835200,5,558,4.336538461538462
8475031,4,B000W73CLA,"A remake of the original movie, ""About Adam.""  However, its a bit different from the original.  Being that its a Korean movie, the topic of sex is taboo throughout this film, which makes it even MORE funnier, but less sexual than the original.  Not a bad job on remaking ""About Adam"" for a Korean comedy film.  An entertaining film.",1151798400,5,332,4.576271186440678
