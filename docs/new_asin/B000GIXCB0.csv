2614498,4,B000GIXCB0,This is a long time favorite of my family. Very pleased with the bluray transfer. I recommend it:-) It makes a great addition to the bluray collection.,1350604800,,151,4.62962962962963
2614499,4,B000GIXCB0,Dennis Quaid is always excellent and in this movie early in his carreer he is superb.  The plot is predictable but good action.,1272412800,4,127,4.521739130434782
2614500,4,B000GIXCB0,"Tough Enough is a good movie, but lacks the stardom that the Rocky series has achieved.  It is very exciting with a lot of action inside the boxing ring.  I thought that the story was a very good one on how it depicts how people struggle through something to attain their primary goal.  This is the basis of the story.  If you don't like the boxing genre of movies you are not going to like this.  Overall it is an entertaining movie with a story that everyone who has a dream can relate to.",984960000,5,491,4.180851063829787
2614501,5,B000GIXCB0,"This is a great movie! It proves that no matter what type of corruption and deception surrounds you, you can still retain your own integrity and be your own man. I'm not a huge Dennis Quaid fan, but I am a fan of his character in this movie.",1419465600,,241,4.041666666666667
2614502,4,B000GIXCB0,"""Tough Enough"" (Anchor Bay Entertainment DV-24390 being the DVD edition viewed) wins on two principal counts -- and somebody should point this out, even if I have to be the one: Dennis Quaid puts up a game fight, very convincingly, and he also sings wonderfully well! His role, after all, is that of a country-western singer who enters into amateur boxing competition in order to gain the reward money to fund his musical career and home life. Dennis Quaid is not known much for his musical ability, but it surely is on display in this movie.

Of the music which Quaid himself sings (others taking some of the remaining songs), he does all of it exceedingly well. His phrasing and his breath control are those of a born vocalist of an high order and the sound of his voice is very pleasing to the ear. Given how many male country music performers of renown (though certainly not the very best of them) huff-and-puff and/or bluff their way, with dodgy intonation and shortness of breath, through what they perform, Dennis Quaid's achievement is all the more remarkable.

The film has a lot of grit and soul, and there is humour, too, with that winsome grin of Dennis Quaid welcomely present when he shows it. I obtained this film at the behest of somebody else and never would have expected to like it so much as I do, since I am not much of a sports enthusiast. This film has taken me by surprise and it just may do the same for other potential viewers as well.",1415145600,,1461,4.509433962264151
2614503,3,B000GIXCB0,Dimwitted film seems like it might just be watchable but it is so uneven and idiotic that you can't really believe that a man like Dennis Quaid has all the pugilistic ability to overcome the tough competition.,1413417600,,209,4.675675675675675

2614506,4,B000GIXCB0,A greatly under-rated movie.  I loved it when it first came out and still do.  I ordered 3 of the dvds.....one for myself and two as gifts for two of my sons.  Another great movie at another great price.,1375056000,,203,4.153846153846154
2614507,3,B000GIXCB0,"I bought this as a fan of Warren Oates whose last film this is. Based it seems on a real annual national amateur boxing contest, the film's story is pretty predictable. With enough scams and manipulation by the sharp witted competition promoter (Oates as ever watchable) and disappointments for the various contestants to keep the story rolling it is a pretty easy on the eye and mind. Dennis Quaid in an early major role is not very convincing and the script despite some attempts to break out of the ""poor boy makes good"" main theme  by reference to racist aspects of the competition (cue Pam Grier) and struggles of an aspiring country singer forced to turn to boxing for the money) really does not progress much beyond standard B movie/TV film fare.

Watchable but not exceptional.",1372118400,,785,4.764705882352941
2614508,4,B000GIXCB0,"I like this movie, it's one of my favorite movies. I bought it to replace the one I wore out. If you haven't seen it before it's worth the effort.",1369008000,,146,3.9
2614509,3,B000GIXCB0,"This was a movie that I used to love to watch on HBO.  It has been a long time since its air time, but it was a good trip down memory lane.",1359417600,,139,3.34375
2614510,5,B000GIXCB0,"Tough Enough is a terrific movie.  Dennis Quaid plays a landscaper who wants to be a country singer.  He takes part in a Tough Man Competition to earn money to pay his bills.  Dennis Quaid had mentioned in interviews that he did some boxing when he was young but I did not think he would be this good.  I have to say that I felt badly everytime he was hit in the head although it only a movie, because he is so handsome.",1356998400,,420,4.024096385542169

8133043,4,B000GIXCB0,"I enjoyed this movie and thought Dennis Quaid did a decent job in the film.  At times it seems like the movie has that made for TV quality for it and not that of a major motion picture.  But the story is decent and with good pacing and an honest feel to the characters.  It isn't just a ROCKY clone and I felt the movie stood on its own two feet.  It has that everyman appeal to the movie of the average guy trying to see what he is made of type of thing.  You don't have to be a country music fan or boxing fan to enjoy this movie.  The Country Western Warrior come on down how cheesy is that but classic at the same time I still easily recall it after 20 years later.  Dennis has the build of a middle weight or lightweight fighter which makes the film more believable.

Dennis quad plays Art Long in the movie.  Art and his wife are dirt poor.  He works as a landscaper and aspires to be a country singer.  He takes on a job in a local amateur boxing competition called Tough Man to earn some extra money.  Tough Man is basically an average Joe boxing tournament not professional.  The contestants are guys from all walks of life, who have different occupations and backgrounds.  While fighting in the competition Art befriends a fellow boxer much more talented than himself name P.T. (Stan Shaw) who gives him some pointers and helps him advance in the tournament who basically becomes his corner man.  The promoter sees superstar potential in Art that can help grow his business and put people in seats.  Dennis surprises everyone including himself by winning the Fort Worth boxing competition and then gets a shot at boxing in a much bigger Tough Man Tournament consisting of champions from the other cities around the U.S. for a big payday.

The movie has some funny moments and for such a low budget film it works and is entertaining.  Dont expect exceptional drama here, but the boxing action is good and definitely looks genuine, not phony or fake.  The casting was very well done and some of the boxer villains are unique like Gay Bob.

Overall I would rate this movie a 4 star film.  At times it is very inspiring and the realistic quality of the characters makes it worth watching.  It does start out a little slow though don't expect instant action right away.",1484697600,,2274,4.428915662650603
