8234410,4,B000YXYMJI,"Mind Food videos take Biblical ideas and profound spiritual truths and present them for our consideration in a combination of sight, sound, and contemplation that can be a most helpful aid in disciplining our minds to think God's thoughts after Him. Spend 3-5 minutes before you do your email watching one of these videos, and you'll have something positive to share with everyone you write. Use them as a break from writing or other computer work, to refocus your thoughts on unseen realities and re-orient your soul to the things that matter most. Or use them in a Bible study group to set the tone for the evening or prepare the group for prayer. But by all means have a look at Mind Food.",1195171200,,692,4.588709677419355
