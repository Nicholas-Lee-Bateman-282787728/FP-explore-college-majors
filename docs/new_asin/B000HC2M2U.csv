2633214,5,B000HC2M2U,"I thought this was an excellent Movie. Visually it was fantastic. It had a very BIG BUDGET look, I'm so tired of the ""HD VIDEO"" Movie where it looks more like a Soap Oprah than a real movie. This was obviously shot on Film. The story was quite good and I'm glad I bought this DVD. I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys quality movies.

2633216,4,B000HC2M2U,"This was almost overlooked, afterall the title isn't very evocative, the cover art lackluster at best, and I presumed it to be another straight-to-video cheapie.  However, I caught wind that this was actually a Swedish vampire movie and I became mildy intrigued.  Sweden isn't particularily reknowned for it's film industry with some well known exceptions of course (Hallstrom, Bergman) and darn it, I haven't heard Swedish in a while, so I thought, what the heck.
I'm not hugely into vampires, but this is a really great entree into the genre, both enormously funny and quite scary.  The story is unconventional, the look is glossy and overall well done with the exception of a sudden and oddly inexeplicable ending.  Part ""Salem's Lot"", part ""Scream"", this is a winner and a great little film.",1185062400,3,795,5.0

Yes, there IS a talking dog in it with no other purpose than to be funny. Guess what?

Frostbite is MEANT to be funny, and is fully deserving of a place alongside Sean of the Dead, Galaxy Quest and American Werewolf in London. Pay no attention to those who miss the point - this is a great, vastly-underrated, and FUNNY horror film.",1175817600,7,420,4.30379746835443
2633218,2,B000HC2M2U,"This Swedish horror comedy about vampires that take over a town during what known as polar night. It is when the sun will remain down for up to 24 hours. This will of course mean the vampires have more timme to roam about town. A pill manufactured  by a vampire scientist that supposed to turn humans into vampires makes it way to a local party. Thinking it's some kind of new drug the teens pass it around without a second thought. It doesn't take long before evryone begins to turn on each other. This movie gets is ridiculous at times. For one, the dogs talk in this movie. Yes they talk. They have no real purpose but to try and be funny nothing else. To make things worse the action does not pick up until the last 25 minutes or so in this film. Until then we only see shadows of killings. Overall Sweden failed attempt at a fun horror-comedy for the vampire genre. It has a bad  script,editing, and video-game effects. I just can not recommend this one.",1175040000,3,959,4.351955307262569

In terms of tone, pacing, and production value, the two movies could not be much more different. Frostbitten is lighthearted (at least by comparison) and frequently attempts to be funny. Occasionally it even succeeds.  Not a bad movie in its own right but if it was recommended to you based on 30DoN, consider yourself warned.",1520812800,,439,4.8533333333333335

8138156,3,B000HC2M2U,"I was impressed with Sweden`s own art house vampire film ""Let The Right One In"", so of course, I was very interested when I heard about ""Frostbitten"" (or Frostbiten according to the film's opening credits), Sweden`s first vampire movie. Directed by Anders Banke, the film is another vampire flick that blends quirky humor, visceral vampirism and genetics as its main premise. The film is a little flimsy if you talk about its plot but the movie is quite fun.

Annika (Petra Nielsen) and her daughter Saga (Grete Hayneskold) had just moved into a snow-laden town somewhere in Sweden. Annika had accepted a position at a local hospital led by an enigmatic Doctor Beckert (Carl-Ake Eriksson). The area is currently experiencing a month-long lack of sunlight and abundance of polar weather. Meanwhile, a young cocky medical assistant named Sebastian (Jonas Carlstrom) steals a batch of red pills from Beckert's office, either out of curiosity or for a ""party favor"" for his friend Vega (Emma Aberg) isn't really clear. After Sebastian takes a red pill, he begins to feel a little sick and very odd; his senses become enhanced, he even begins to hear dogs talk and has gained an intolerance to normal food. Sebastian also finds that he is slowly developing a lust for blood...

Let's see, ""Frostbitten"" isn't going to make my list of favorite vampire films but I have to admit the movie does have its charm. I guess the best way to describe the movie would be a collision of quirky comedy and blood-soaked adrenaline, it bounces around jump scares and comedy while maintaining a feeling of tension. The movie's plot is full of gaps and characterization is kept at a bare minimum. The ""30 Days of Night"" angle isn't really brought into play as much as I would have liked since this element only serves as a very minor ingredient to the film's plot. The film's central focus falls upon its teenage characters such as Sebastian, Vega and company who are out to have fun.

Sebastian takes center stage as the first victim of the red pill. His slow transformation to a vampire pretty much sets the film's tone and I have to admit, the sequences really cracked me up. It comes off a little grim at times, as we see Sebastian trying to drink his household condiments (ketchup, milk, juice etc.) and finds that his body is rejecting them. The young man's meeting with his girlfriend's parents become rather humorous as her father is a minister and you can guess what happens when he hears him saying `grace' and gets fed with a trout cooked in garlic sauce. Yes, the film does have its charm and parts of it were very funny and entertaining.

Sadly, the film has several plot missteps that I thought were just rather disappointing. The plot with our mysterious Dr. Beckert is a little underdeveloped that this subplot never becomes compelling or interesting. I also felt that the sequences with Beckert and Annika didn't match the tone of the rest of the film. In this area, the film feels rather episodic and lacked coherency in its script. I thought the movie was going to be a solid comedic bloodbath but this area just felt a little too forced. The Nazi angle at the beginning of the film didn't really reach any inherent gravity to the narrative; it feels rather insignificant. It does provide some background to the vampire named Maria and to Beckert, but the way it just becomes attached into the plot is very difficult to buy into. However, I liked Beckert's transformation sequence, I thought it was a good homage to old-school effects.

""Frostbitten"" has a lot of things going on between the fun-hungry teenagers and the Annika-Beckert struggle and the film does have several editing tricks up its sleeve. It did hold my focus and I felt like I was watching one of your cheesy horror low-budget films. I guess this was what the director intended. The vampires are curiously very sensitive to light, they can be repelled by a copy machine and even by a car's powerful headlights. The vampires themselves have the superhuman qualities we see in most vampire movies; strong, fast and feral. The vampires can be killed by the usual traditional means. The film also does have very nice cinematography that accentuates the frozen environment. From the indoors and the outdoors, the film does have the right atmosphere.

This Swedish vampire thriller relies on its visuals and brings the core of its story from genetic studies. I thought the transformation from human to vampire through the use of a pill is a little hard to buy into. The film is also very predictable and rather unoriginal; it also lacks innovation and feels very routine with its barefaced scares. To its credit, the film does have its charm and leanness; the film has enough vampire stunts, humor and bloody scenes to charm the horror fan. The film is amiable enough and accompanied by good visuals, ""Frostbitten"" can be fun when you're in the mood for a vampire movie with flamboyance and comedic allure.

Recommended! [3 Stars= Good with Flaws and Redeeming Qualities]",1254787200,4,5030,4.8013856812933025
8138157,4,B000HC2M2U,"Imagine my surprise when I watched this film not knowing what to expect or even remembering where I heard about it from and finding that Sweden not only made one vampire film for the ages in the last decade (the enchanting&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Let-The-Right-One-In/dp/B001MYIXAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Let The Right One In</a>), but already had hit a more traditional home run for the genre a few years ago with 2006's ""Frostbiten"" (one t or two, take your pick).  The premise is thoroughly standard, but the execution is fabulous.  Almost everything you want from a modern vampire film with only a few cliche's holding it back.  If you love vampire films, this should be on your list.

The story begins during the German's ill-fated assault on the Soviet Union in WWII.  Now, the first thing i thought was ""What if a localized vampiric plague was what really stopped the Third Reich's advance and won the war for the Allies? A great idea!""  However, this is merely the genesis of the story.  SS troops encounter an abandoned cabin to hole up in and find that they weren't the only evil bastards to have that idea.  Slaughter follows.  Fast forward six decades to modern Sweden, where cute new girl in town Saga meets adorably quirky goth goddess Vega, who is eager to befriend the fresh meat.  There's a familiar-looking geneticist with a strange interest in a comatose girl (never a good thing) and a lot of mysterious pills at the hospital where Saga'a mother works, and all of the teens in town are attending a party.  The perfect prescription for a vampire infection.  And just in time for the region's own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/30-Days-of-Night/dp/B00111YM5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">30 Days of Night</a>&nbsp;too.

Emma Aberg is beyond charming as Vega in this film.  I just have to say that right away.  Great character.  The rest of the film is fairly standard, but very effective.  Moments involving vampires clinging to ceilings or even telephone poles are extremely well-done, as is the story of a boy who slowly becomes a vampire over the course of the film.  Let's just say he devours a fluffy bunny and a lapdog and leave it at that.  No.  Let's not.  In a bizarre but surprisingly awesome comedic twist, the kid finds he can understand the speech of dogs.  It sounds stupid, but the dogs actually made me laugh pretty hard without ruining the tone of the film.  It's just crazy enough to work, as they say.  I've seen a lot of films about people slowly transforming into vamps, but this one did it best in my opinion.  Watching him try to quench his thirst with every beverage in the fridge and finding each undrinkable and then meeting his girlfriend's parents for the first time and being served a garlicy meal were other high points of this side story.  In another effective bit of humor, Saga crosses two sticks to ward off an advancing vamp who hisses and shrinks away  and then laughs and tells her she's making an X.  Comedy aside, the violence is pretty visceral and shocking at times.  No sex or nudity that I can recall.  Sorry, exploitation fans.

So basically what we wind up with is an army of undead spawned from the goddamn Third Reich ready to run loose in Sweden and a vampire boss that turns out to be really cliche when he changes forms.  Hate it when they go over-the-top in the final stretch.  But for the most part, this is a great vampire film on par with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fright-Night/dp/0767817664/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fright Night</a>&nbsp;at least.  A little better even.  There are some really, really impressive shots and the special effects are subtle and effective.  I particularly enjoyed shot where Saga takes a kid into a room and shuts off the lights to leave the entire screen black save for a pair of glowing red eyes. When the lights come back on, there's no one to be seen. Creepy as hell.

This should be considered a must-see for fans of modern vampire tales.  Only ""Let the Right One In"" is as good when comparing vampire films from the last 5 years. Maybe even 10.  Most solid vampire films struggle to get rounded up from 3 1/2 with me so don't be the least bit turned off by me deducting a star from the rating.  Because if it's standard premise an somewhat muddled final act it's not getting a 5, but neither would a lot of my favorite vampire flicks.  This is still one of the better ones I've ever seen.  I hope Sweden keeps it's interest in the genre strong because if they keep this up, American vamp films will get snowed under by films like ""Frostbitten"".  It's creepy, it's funny, and it's damn entertaining.",1253923200,,4754,4.97211660329531
8138158,4,B000HC2M2U,"Frostbitten is a Swedish-made horror movie about vampires with a Nazi SS bloodline. Yes, you heard that right--Nazi SS vampires! It also has a very effective dark humor which runs throughout the movie. Frostbitten is only in Swedish language, with optional English subtitles. So, if subtitles annoy you then, this one may not be for you, no matter what. However, if you can handle that, then you may find this one an entertaining and rather humorous gem of a lesser-known horror film.

For all you hard-core war/horror fans out there, Frostbitten mostly just begins with a war-related scene. However, it's really quite a good one. From there, the war/SS theme runs throughout the movie and continues only as the basis for what's happening otherwise.

About right now, you're probably wondering exactly where and how the Nazi/war element weaves within this otherwise hardcore vampire movie. Well, it begins at the very beginning. As the movie opens, a group of SS soldiers from the 5th SS Panzergrenadier Division Wiking are seeking shelter in a seemingly deserted, snow-covered cabin in the woods. Once inside, the SS soldiers find that the cabin is not so deserted as they thought. Inside, they begin an unwinnable battle with the undead which produces vampire lineage surviving into present-day Sweden. The original SS Officer is later the head of the clan, with all sorts of modern-day vampiric adventures. This movie is in the same vein (no pun intendend) as the recent 30 Days of Night which deals with a vampire party during a month-long period of natural darkness.

As I said earlier, Frostbitten has some very effective dark humor (which I love). There is even a hilarious scene involving a talking dog, which you have to see to understand and appreciate. I'm not even going to attempt to explain it, although it does make sense when it happens.  The acting and special effects are also quite good, always keeping the movie better than it might be otherwise.

In the end, as promised, Frostbitten does circle back into the the SS soldier theme, with a climax in which the heroine does battle with the undead SS vampire fuhrer. It's all really better than it sounds, believe it or not. This is really one of those movies that only seems ridiculous when when one tries to describe it. The intentional dark humor element only helps to make that even more difficult.

Trust me.  Frostbitten will take a serious bite out of most anyone who takes the time to experience it.  For some, that bite may be more enjoyable than expected.  So, expose yourself to the thrills, and get Frostbitten today!",1232668800,3,2597,4.884090909090909
8138159,1,B000HC2M2U,"I'm usually not harsh on movies and my expertise on vampire films lacks a great deal but this Swedish `horror' film was almost painful to sit through. This movie started off with all the components of making it a truly great and darkening story; a never-ending curse dating back to WWII, isolation in the cold and dark with no escape, foreign lands and unknown territories. (Not to mention a research laboratory! the number of potential shocking scenarios were endless). As the depressing Russian song played in the background I was set up for a cold and bitter tale of an inescapable unnatural haunting and feeding on the human kind through the centuries. Instead the film cut to current time of teenage drug obsession and not in an interesting matter. The deep and dark secret (which itself was a predictable disappointment) of the peculiar doctor was overshadowed by the fact that vampirism became a minuscule infection transported through pills. The constant struggle of comedy and horror was tiring and boring; at a certain point nothing could come up on the screen that would surprise or interest me. The humor was so desperate and obvious that at some times I thought this couldn't possibly be a comedy film; yet the talking dogs and over-portrayed teenagers proved me wrong.
  The drug hungry youth was transformed into vampires through small red pills that were stolen from the laboratory. The interesting question arises of what exactly it means to be a vampire in this movie. The act of actually becoming a vampire and solely feeding on victims is not distinguished; anybody can join the club either by getting eaten in random places, bit, or by taking a nicely packaged red pill that embodies all the necessities to make one a vampire. Or even better by drinking two sips of alcoholic punch that dissolves these pills in seconds. Nobody is chosen to be vampire because of certain skills, there is not ritual of blood exchange to make someone a follower - just take the pill, or be eaten.
  The film lacked details that make a movie interesting and thrilling; but mostly the direction was just wrong. The storyline could have been molded to fit the dark beginning, instead it focused on an epidemic with no background of the ""disease/infection or curse"".",1204761600,2,2265,4.875324675324675
8138160,1,B000HC2M2U,"I was excited to see ""Frostbitten."" I mean, a kooky Swedish kid wearing giant headphones and a bloody grimace ... who doesn't want to see that? Talking dogs? Are you kidding?! There's a reason why I watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Summer-of-Sam/dp/B00002RAO2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Summer of Sam</a>&nbsp;... and it's not because I'm a Spike Lee fan. I am ALL about talking dogs. (And I am assuming that the vampires of ""Frostbitten"" cannot communicate with rabbits because they are not among the prescribed catalog of ""vampire minion""?!! PLEASE! Tell me you weren't waiting for some carrot-conversation?! It couldn't have hurt.) With all the fantastic reviews I read here, I gathered my cinema-studies students and pushed play. Ninety-eight minutes later, my gummy-bear pelted hair had endured the wrath of some very annoyed students (jk). But, their overall reaction was shared by me: this film failed to sustain laughs, intrigue, and interest.

Foremost, (let's get picky!) the film is fighting two different approaches to vampirism (and badly). Is it an infectious disease (the doctor compares it to ""rabies"") or is it a supernatural affliction (a ""curse"")? Must it be one or the other? No. But, it shouldn't be a muddled mess. Now, I'm not fond of vampire films that adhere to ""the rules."" Watching these vampires shrink from crucifixes, vanish in mirrors, become repulsed by garlic, and have red glowing eyes ... well, nothing innovative there. And wooden stakes? Really?! But then having to endure the meager innovations presented (like ""vampire pills"") was even more painful. The point distilled: we are dealing with a confused, inept work.

As far as technical points are concerned: The film-stock is about the equivalent of a local television-commercial. The special-effects are laughable (not in a ""good"" way). The direction was devoid of finesse. Cinematography ... was there a cinematographer? The script was amateurish, at best. The jokes fell hopelessly flat (and not as a result of poor translation or a cultural-barrier ... the jokes were just ""lame."") And, ummm, monster-vision?!! Hackneyed.

8138161,4,B000HC2M2U,"I primarily bought the video being a fan and user of Russian Konvas and Kinor cameras which were used to shoot this film. The look is excellent and the special effects are reminiscent of Harryhausen, which gives a fresh breath to the overly slick effects used today.
