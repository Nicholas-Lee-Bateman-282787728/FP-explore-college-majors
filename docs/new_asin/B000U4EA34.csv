8212089,3,B000U4EA34,"It was more of a doc than a hunters movie. It was a little slow, but did learn a bunch of new stuff about free diving and spear fishing.",1262649600,2,136,3.7241379310344827
8212090,4,B000U4EA34,"This video is a true inspiration for all free divers who have ever had the  desire to try spearfishing. The brilliant photography shown is with out a  doubt, the best I have ever seen on any spearfishing documentary.  Underwater images of Tahitian spearfishermen hunting, great footage of  Terry landing his world record Bluefin tuna and the gear that he used.  Beautiful scenes of Catalina Island, California, hunting for white sea bass  are just a few of the highlights.
In the video he also takes you back in  time to meet two ledgendary figures who are recognized as the fore fathers  of spearfishing as a sport, and pioneers in developing the first free  diving gear. They also started the first club dedicated to spearfishing and  freediving.
Terry is very candid as to conveying the dangers that are  associated with this exhillarating sport. This is a very important part of  the video, as most people who get involved are not fully aware of what may  occur.
Terry has a genuine enthusiasm that all spearfishermen share for  spearfishing and shows this very well, right from the rush of adrenaline  before shooting a fish, to simply freediving among spectacular sea  creatures such as Whale Sharks. The interaction freedivers have with these  immense creatures is well depicted as Terry and some friends hitch a ride  on ones back.
The video lacks in some of the technical areas of the sport  because of the detail needed to clearly convey them, but this is more than  made up for in the accompanying book, which depicts and explains all  aspects of the sport in detail. I would definitely recommend having both  the book and video if you are seriously contemplating getting involved or  are already involved.
This is an extremely entertaining video you will  enjoy viewing with friends over and over again.",968803200,7,1815,4.894736842105263
