8393091,5,B003AOMQAA,"Before I begin, this is my first time that I have had the chance to review a Ring Of Honor PPV event since beforehand, I just witnessed greatest hits of the promotion that opened the door to so many young talents today like CM Punk, Samoa Joe, Christopher Daniels, AJ Styles, Bryan Danielson & so many more. During a dismal time where injuries along with questionable to poor booking was becoming a factor for the wrestling business in the year 2007, ROH stepped up & put that aside to deliver the best WRESTLING show of the year.

Four Corner Survival: Nigel McGuinness vs Chris Hero vs Naomichi Marufuji vs Claudio Castagnoli. The rules were similar to how a four corners match would be done in ECW with the difference being that this match didn't have eliminations as the first person to gain the pinfall would win the match. On top of that, the added stipulation was that the winner of this match would become the top contender for the ROH Heavyweight Championship. This was honestly one of the best opening matches that I have seen as this was just a wrestling clinic with each person getting a moment to shine such as Marufuji taking a page out of Tajiri's playbook with various kicks, Hero hanging in there despite being the rookie & even the sequences between Claudio & Nigel that was impressive for two big men. Also various stories were told such as Claudio looking for revenge against Hero & Larry Sweeney's group along with Nigel struggling to get one last shot at the gold.

Rocky Romero vs Matt Cross. This next match was the first of three matches in a Best of 3 falls between Austin Aries & Roderick Strong's respected stables with the stipulation being that after each fall one member of a team rotates unless the team gets two straight falls. This specific match didn't top the previous match due to the fact that they didn't get as much time but in the short time that they went out there, this was a fast paced action packed match that lead to....

Austin Aries vs Davey Richards...the second match in the Best of 3 falls between the two teams. Unlike how the previous match was a fun but short match, this match easily topped that match as this was just a very athletic encounter with both men taking it to each other whether it was high-flying or mat-wrestling. However, keep your eye on the very beginning that actually will play a factor within the next following match which was....

Roderick Strong vs Erick Stevens...the final match in the Best of 3 Falls match (amazing for just one night) Now I know that this might be a spoiler but in a 2 out 3 Falls match, what did you expect? Due to how Strong acted during the previous match, Erick Stevens gladly volunteered to take on the leader of the group. There's an old saying in the wrestling business in which ""when there's a hold, there is a counter hold"" because these two just wouldn't stay down no matter what was done to them whether it was an impressive wrestling move or even a high impact counter off the turnbuckle. This was the best performance of Erick Steven's career as the effort that these men delivered was so great that the crowd gave all six men a standing ovation & even chanted for each name.

ROH Heavyweight Champion Takeshi Morishima vs Bryan Danielson. This is the rematch from what was voted as the match of the year by the Pro Wrestling Illustrated with the difference being that Danielson came into this match with a severely damaged eye that he even had to wear an eye patch for it. This was a great wrestling match that followed the patterns of ""big man vs little man"" as Morishima had a huge size advantage that would become a factor many times during the match including at one point where Danielson had trouble doing a small package or even a cradle. The storytelling was on point here as Danielson just wouldn't be denied & pulled off plenty of impressive moves against a much larger man before it was the injury of Danielson that became the focal point of the match that lead to the referee doing what he felt he had to do.

Ladder War: ROH Tag Team Champions The Briscoe Brothers vs Kevin Steen & El Generico. The final match in this popular feud that went from tag team matches, hardcore matches, steel cage matches...etc so the best way to end this match was a ladder match. Just like their previous matches, this match started off as a wild brawl throughout the crowd with moments like El Generico & Matt Briscoe being thrown into a row of chairs, both teams taking some vicious chair shots that lead to both Briscoe Brothers being heavily busted open. Once the match got back to the ring & the ladder became a factor, this match became a human highlight reel as there were just so many moments that would not only shock you but leave you shocked to the point where the crowd just kept chanting ""PLEASE DON'T DIE"". Various highlights include El Generico getting double hip-blocked through a ladder in the corner, Steen delivering his package piledriver through a ladder stacked between the corner & another ladder, Jay delivering his finishing move onto a ladder that you just have to see to believe, both teams being knocked off the ladder onto another broken ladder, Steen taking the worst fall off the top of the ladder that made you shocked that he wasn't injured & the highlight of the night for me as you see the Briscoe Brothers deliver the Road Warrior's ""Devastation Device"" off a springboard literally through a standing ladder that was just amazing. There were just so many highlights that I might have lost count but without question this was their best match of the feud, match of the night & one of the best ladder matches that I have ever seen in professional wrestling that even the botched finish & the aftermath with Jimmy Jacobs, Necro Butcher & Tyler Black didn't take away from the match itself.

Along with this event, you get a couple of bonus matches that happened for the live crowd after the PPV event was over:

Mitch Franklin vs Alex Payne. This match was the finals of the Top of the Class trophy tournament. Just a short & enjoyable contest.

Amazing Kong & Daizee Haze vs Lacey & Sara Del Rey. This one match will clearly show that not all women matches tend to be horrible as this was a very good tag team match with each woman putting on a good effort while Kong was the main player by being the most powerful in the match but pay close attention to her spinning back fist to Sara had everyone in the crowd turn away.

BJ Whitmer & Brent Albright vs Chasyn Rance & Kenny King. Another match that was short but enjoyable & watchable within that time.

Jack Evans vs Tyler Black. This was just a no contest as this match was nothing more than to start off the next bonus match which was...

Jack Evans & The Irish Airborne vs Jimmy Jacobs, Tyler Black & Necro Butcher...this match. And just like the previous match, this was just a no contest as these teams just kept on brawling to the point that it was so out of control that everyone just got out of the way & let them do what they wanted to do.

Delirious vs Matt Sydal. For those that don't know or remember, Matt Sydal is the current WWE star Evan Bourne & this was scheduled as the final match in their series. Just like their previous series of matches, they put on a good performance whether it came to good quality wrestling, high-flying & even some comedic moments including Delirious playing mind games with Matt and Larry Sweeney pulling a ""Ric Flair"" when it came to his interaction with the referee & even taking off his jacket.

Overall, if there is one event to get from 2007, it would be this one as this has not only gone down as the best show of 2007 but also one of the best events that Ring Of Honor has ever delivered in their history. I highly recommend to find a copy of this as a true wrestling fan must have this in their collection.",1276473600,4,7855,4.4877536738978305
