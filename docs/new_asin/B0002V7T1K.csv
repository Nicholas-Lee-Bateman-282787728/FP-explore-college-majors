8032387,3,B0002V7T1K,"I recently purchased Nada Yoga: The Healig Power of Sacred Sound because I was intrigued by this particular form of practice. I had learned about it through having followed the career of the famous American-born Hindu convert, kirtan (call-and-response Hindu chant) artist, author, yogi and guru Bhagavan Das, the first Westerner to be a disciple of the great Hindu guru, Neem Karori (or Karoli) Baba Maharaj (1900-1973), and was curious what it involved. I was expecting the practice to involve the chanting of the Omkar (the Om sound) and/or other sacred syllables, but in reality, it was not. Even though it was certainly very spiritual, it was not as deep and philosophical as I thought it would be. This was a shame, because I remember having read about this documentary online, and it sounded intriguing. It appeared to be simply the chanting of one syllable over and over. I was expecting to get more insight into the philosophy, the history and the origins of the practice as well as various styles of this type of chanting, but that is not what I got. Dont get me wrong---it is a very beautiful, calming documentary, which I could see someone putting on if they wanted something soothing in the background while they were trying to sleep or to do something that required a lot of concentration, but as I had said, I was expecting the presenter, Shanti Shivani, to explore all different types of mantras which could be used in various ways while practicing Nada Yoga, that did not happen, which is why I ended up not watching the whole movie.
 Again, this DVD would be good for someone if they wanted something to put on for the purposes of calming down after a stressful day, but honestly, if you want to actually learn about the practice and philosophy that is involved with yoga, I would suggest that you skip this documentary, and try the following DVDs instead:

-Yoga Unveiled (directed by Gita Desai)

-Awake: The Life of Yogananda (directed by Paola Di Florio and Lisa Leeman)

-Origins of Yoga (directed by Paula Fouce)

-Yoga Is (directed by Suzanne Bryant).

Again---this DVD would be good for those who wish to use it for actual meditation practice, or who enjoy watching something on TV to which they do not have to pay much attention while doing some sort of work, for instance, but if you are looking for a documentary that would teach you about the history and philosophy of the various yogic techniques practiced by the great yogis and yoginis of India, then look elsewhere.",1515456000,,2499,4.759815242494226

8032390,4,B0002V7T1K,"This DVD follows good pedagogical procedure in presenting material and the opportunity to participate in skill development, step by step, as the DVD proceeds. Shanti Shivani's teaching style is inviting and confidence building. I hope for more of this quality in the various aspects and applications of Nada Yoga.",1368489600,3,313,5.408163265306122
8032391,5,B0002V7T1K,"[...] is the link to the trailer on Youtube if you are interested in a sample of what this video is about. I had the honor of training with Shanti Shivani in workshops and classes. She is the real deal. I've read the other reviews for this DVD. The person who said it made him/herself sick probably didn't realize the intense healing that was occurring as a result of the power of this music. When one is clearing they may become nauseous or experience other physical symptoms. As one tunes oneself to these ancient healing tones, he/she may become a more sensitive being. One may experience profound emotional releases not knowing why. That is ok. This is not a DVD to be casually purchased. The Sacred Sounds contained within, whether one performs the yoga or not will affect the listener. If you are new to this subject you may want to study spiritual awakening symptoms before purchasing this DVD. There are many spiritual gifts to receive from following the practice. I advise watching it in the evening when you have a couple days off coming up so you can rest, relax and fully integrate the healing contained on this DVD. Play it, go through the healing. Give yourself time and play it again. The more you release emotionally, physically and psychically, the more available you are for healing next time you watch it. The process goes on and on. You get better and better, clearer and more free. The bottom line-this is not a DVD about healing. It is a DVD that actually delivers it. Shanti also has other products available on her website [...]",1367020800,7,1552,4.647272727272727

8032393,1,B0002V7T1K,I had high hopes for this video because I'd read that there are healing powers in sounds.  But there is a very irritating high pitch spinning noise on the background of this video that I just can't figure out.  I couldn't even continue to watch to see what she was saying.  The background noise was almost making me feel sick.  This one has already been retired to the shelf.,1299196800,2,375,4.391304347826087
8032394,3,B0002V7T1K,I wish Amazon would have a sampler with clips from the DVD to listen see before we could buy the DVD. It would be very similar to Look Inside Books feature that they have for books.,1298678400,2,181,4.055555555555555
8032395,5,B0002V7T1K,"This is a great DVD, I think anyone who does the exercises in ""Sound Yoga/Nada Yoga: The Healing Power of Sound"", will truly begain to understand the Power of Healing Sound.",1215129600,8,173,4.612903225806452
8032396,5,B0002V7T1K,"This DVD is an excellent introduction to this amazing, healing and vibrational form of yoga.  So many of us in the West think that yoga is only a series of physical postures. But there is so much more!

Through the medium of this DVD I learned that the yogic tradition also contains exercises and teachings designed to bring out the healing powers of my own voice. The clarity and authenticity of the teaching presented here makes it apparent that Shanti has had extensive years of training in India with the great masters in this ancient tradition. .

With the relaxing sound of the tanpura purring behind her, Shanti presents a range of vocal techniques which include movements, breathing exercises and the chanting of sacred sounds. As someone who loves to sing Kirtan, I find this to be an excellent tool for warming up the voice and bringing me into emotional alignment. It has also given me a personal experience of the natural beauty and power of the human voice. I love this DVD and watch it often for it brings me a sense of tranquility, grace and timeless beauty.",1145232000,29,1073,4.666666666666667
