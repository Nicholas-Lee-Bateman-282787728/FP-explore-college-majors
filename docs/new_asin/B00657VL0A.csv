8493330,5,B00657VL0A,"I thought the DVD was truly excellent. I was extremely impressed with both the theoretical presentation of the steps involved helping children with delayed speech learn to talk and interact with other children and with Dr. Densmore's seemingly inexhaustible energy and intuitive ability to engage emotionally with the children. She appeared able to connect with even the most isolated children and to use her own enthusiastic personality to ""get through"" to them. I highly recommend this DVD,both to parents with children who have language difficulties and to clinicians.",1529452800,,571,5.5
8493331,5,B00657VL0A,"The video is clear and well structured. Dr. Densmore enumerates the stages of learning and social communication in a clear and concise way, and demonstrates each phase.  Really interesting and really well done.",1523836800,,210,5.363636363636363
8493332,2,B00657VL0A,"I wanted all the nitty gritty details as to how to help my grandson speak more than one or two words at a time, something I don't feel this DVD provided . To me it looks more like an overview of a method that might be helpful if you can find a clinician.  It may also be helpful to know before you purchase this DVD,  that the method used requires the participation of at least one other child.",1477526400,,394,4.038461538461538
