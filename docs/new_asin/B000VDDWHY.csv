8218221,1,B000VDDWHY,"Looks like  nothing has changed in ufology.
""The MJ-12 documents are the most important documents ever to be leaked""
You have got to be kidding..
The author of the book and reviewers still don't understand the mj12 documents were complete and utter garbage.
No wonder the field is a complete and utter joke.
If rational thinking was an organ. then it atrophied years ago with ufologists.
Cant they actually do research before they write books or reviews anymore..
and yes..I must work for the secret world govt team that stops the truth getting out.
I believe ufo`s exist..but you don't need govt`s to try and discredit the phenomena too hard with the the people ""involved"" in it doing such a great job of making the whole thing a joke..
well done guys..",1279324800,2,754,4.712121212121212
8218222,5,B000VDDWHY,Great Information and Nicely Produced. I was very happy I purchased this DVD product. If your a Truth-seeker and want real facts about the US Governments covert activities with UFOs then the story about MJ-12 is vital evidence that will lead you to the facts that can not be denied. The MJ-12 documents are the most important documents ever to be leaked to the public that US involvement with UFOs and ETs aka: EBEs are real. I've been interested in this part of the UFO-ET story for a long time and this film which was featured on the Sci Fi channel is the film to see. It also includes 2-DVDs of bonus material not seen in the original Sci Fi channel program. This film is very thorough at covering all of the known facts about MJ-12 and then goes deeper than any other investigation to date to verify all of the facts leaving me convinced that the MJ-12 documents are real and the US government does have a secret covert agenda regarding UFOs and EBEs. Nicely done! FYI: The functionality of the DVDs work great and everything is chaptered for easy navigation. I was very pleased!,1242518400,33,1083,4.530612244897959
8218223,2,B000VDDWHY,"The first disc has a good program. Discs two and three consists of additional commentary.

Also, UOPs (User Operation Prohibition) are enabled on all 3 DVDs, prohibiting the viewer from Fast Forwarding during sections that are protected by this universally loathed feature, meaning that you are FORCED to watch certain content (previews, long introductions) that you have no interest in.

If not for the UOPs (User Operation Prohibition) it would be 4 Stars.",1196467200,40,458,5.260273972602739
