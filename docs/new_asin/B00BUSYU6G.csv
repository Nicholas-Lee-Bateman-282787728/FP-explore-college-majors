8574196,1,B00BUSYU6G,"Worthless Piece of etc.
I have endured some bad movies in hopes of them getting better or having a redeeming ending but this movie takes the cake (of cow dung) It purports to be of an aspiring student making a film that will land him in a cinema class,but his shaky,wobbly, hand held techniques only serve to induce head aches and boredom in the unlucky viewer. Majority of the film (using the term very loosely) is in a dark  old mansion,if the rotting wood and paint peeling walls would be edited out the film would be about 30 minutes shorter, actually this is not a bad suggestion for the director/editor should he ever make another attempt at a decent product. I will try to remember his name so I can avoid future efforts. Dont even rent it if you have anything, like napping, better to do.",1385596800,2,796,4.4520547945205475

8574198,5,B00BUSYU6G,This film was great! More funny than scary... Great Indie horror and wouldn't be suprised if it ends up in theaters.,1378771200,,116,4.571428571428571
