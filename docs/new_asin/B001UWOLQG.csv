3814583,5,B001UWOLQG,"Something about Julia McKenzie in the role of Miss Marple rings truer to me than the earlier actors in the role that I have seen.  She combines the best of both: the confident maturity of a Joan Hickson with the sparkle of Geraldine McEwan.  I find her portrayal absolutely delightful.  I would love to see more Miss Marple mysteries produced with McKenzie in the title role.  In fact, I would love to have Julia as my next-door neighbor.  Her Miss Marple is the one I intend to add to my library!",1248566400,7,497,4.417582417582418
3814584,2,B001UWOLQG,"The character of Agatha Christie's creation Miss Marple is endearing and fascinating for various reasons.  The key ingredients that make for this are sadly lacking in this Series 4 presentation of the elderly sleuth character.  Christie's creation has the capacity to make herself disappear into the wallpaper.  She is always watching, always listening, interviewing potential suspects in the most inauspicious manner, her eyes calm and gentle, but probing and digging all the while.  She is quite witty, yet by no means self-possessed.  She does not respond as if she sees herself as a cute old lady.  She does,in fact, sometimes respond as if she secretly wished she could reel her ""feelers"" in and just enjoy society without stumbling upon so many of its' foibles and flaws.  As perceptible as she is, Miss Marple often considers herself one who has stumbles on the truth of the matter......We know better.  We know that Miss Marple is a relentless searcher of truth and an unrivaled genius at unearthing the dark things in human nature.......Joan Hickson was so adept at portraying the subtleties of the Marple character, all the more powerful for seeming understated.  Geraldine McEwan, although not supported by the quality scripts and direction of the Hickson tenure,resonated as Miss Marple.  She was quietly loving, fiercely loyal, but don't let that ever present twinkle in McEwan's eye fool you:  She could just as easily pass you that cup of tea and ask when you pulled the trigger right after she inquired if you took sugar with the beverage....In this Series 4 depiction, Miss Marple does not come off so much as an intuitive unassuming armchair detective as she seems simply like a nosy, prying old lady.  If Agatha Christie's character ever made bold enough to rummage through someone's bureau drawers, it would be in the course of a sanctioned errand or with some other ""legal"" means to trespass.....A true rendering of the Marple character is replete with that disinterested air that allows the guilty to relax so that her genius could be better facilitated. Miss Marple is not so hands on; she solves the mystery at hand with the inner workings of a mind even experts on human behavior can't fathom.......McKenzie does not truly understand her character here, and therefore this Series 4 adaptation does not work.",1248134400,12,2332,5.044270833333333
3814585,5,B001UWOLQG,"""Agatha Christie: Marple"", a British mystery television series made by ITV Global Entertainment, comes to us as a four-DVD set, released to coincide with its July 2009 TV debut on the Masterpiece Mystery! Show, Public Broadcasting System stations, this side of the pond. This is actually series four of the most newly-made adaptations of these ever-popular stories; four new feature-length mysteries, and a new star, Julia McKenzie (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cranford/dp/B00140PK6O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cranford</a>;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Notes-on-a-Scandal/dp/B000NIVJFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Notes on a Scandal</a>), taking up the tweed.  (Series 1-3, starring Geraldine McEwan, have previously been released in this country; McEwan has, apparently, retired.)  The four episodes run approximately 372 minutes; other special features include subtitles. (Thank you Acorn Media, though I actually found that I could follow the shows quite well without them, as characters clearly speak Standard English.)

These entertaining shows bear the trademarks of British TV: accuracy as to post-World War II detail, and lavish productions.  The estates are grand, the scenery is lovely, the scripts are witty, complex, and sharply-focused.  As always, the spinster Miss Marple, the ladylike, outwardly unremarkable little old lady created by Dame Agatha Christie, and beloved by millions, blends right into fashionable English society; but she brings her observant and insightful wits with her wherever she goes.

The supporting casts are packed with stars.  A wonderfully costumed Joan Collins (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dynasty-Season-Four-Vol-1/dp/B001QU9RRK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dynasty: Season Four, Vol. 1</a>); Matthew Macfadyn (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pride-Prejudice-2003/dp/B0002ZH5PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pride & Prejudice (2003)</a>); Jemma Redgrave (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bramwell-Series-4-2-DVD-Set/dp/B0002J4ZUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bramwell Series 4 (2 DVD Set)</a>); Anna Chancellor (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Four-Weddings-and-a-Funeral/dp/B00000JRTX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Four Weddings and a Funeral</a>); Rupert Graves (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Forsyte-Saga-The-Complete-Series/dp/B00007149J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Forsyte Saga - The Complete Series</a>); Prunella Scales (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fawlty-Towers-The-Complete-Series/dp/B00005LC1H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fawlty Towers - The Complete Series</a>); Helen Baxendale (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-Unsuitable-Job-for-a-Woman-1-and-2/dp/B000XBPDY4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An Unsuitable Job for a Woman 1 and 2</a>).  Also Warren Clarke; Brian Cox, Natalie Dormer, Rafe Spall, and Samantha Bond.  The episodes are:
1. A Pocket Full of Rye.  Rex Fortescue, wealthy businessman, has been poisoned; soon Gladys, now in his household, a former maid of Ms. Marple's, will be found strangled, a clothes pin stuck on her nose.  Someone seems to have some very nasty intentions, and to be following a child's nursery rhyme in their execution.
2. Murder Is Easy.  As long as nobody realizes there's a murderer at work.  Marple briefly meets another elderly woman, Miss Pinkerton, who remarks about this, on a London-bound train.  When our detective learns that Miss Pinkerton, too, has died, she travels to the seemingly peaceful village of Wychwood-under-Ashe to investigate its rash of mysterious deaths.
3. They Do It with Mirrors.  Carrie-Louise, old friend of Marples, has always had a soft heart for charitable causes; currently she's keeping young criminals in a reformatory at the foot of her garden.  Her glamorous sister Ruth van Rydock (Collins, in full drag) is concerned, and asks Marples to look into things.  Murders ensue.
4. Why Didn't They Ask Evans?  A dying man's last words send a local young couple off detecting; soon Marple joins them at Castle Savage, inhabited by a very odd family, recently returned from China, whose paterfamilias has just died, leaving behind a will that's full of mystery.

These episodes are extremely well-done in every way, and quite enjoyable -- you can't go wrong with them.",1247788800,9,4544,7.350553505535055
3814586,4,B001UWOLQG,"I've only seen ""Pocketful of Rye"" on PBS but Julia McKenzie rocks as the witty, ingenius detective. I loved what I saw. The mystery, as always with Agatha Christie, was nearly impossible to unravel. As it is with all Miss Marple and Poirot's, it's the person you'd last suspect. I don't know why I never learn, but I can never guess who it is (until very close to the end, if at all) because I say, ""No, it couldn't be them."" Agatha Christie is a really good writer, and if you enjoy mystery, I suggest Poirot- now there's another really good detective!
If all the other episodes are as good as ""Pocketful of Rye"" then this dvd is defineitly a keeper.",1247270400,6,651,4.3884297520661155
3814677,3,B001UWOLQG,"As i wrote in my review of Marple Series 1 ; this series has nothing to do with Miss Marple.
I think Julia McKenzie is a slight improvement versus  Geraldine McEwan that played the role the first three seasons.

3814683,3,B001UWOLQG,"Julia McKenzie take over the Miss Jane Maple role this fourth season in the series, as Geraldine McEwan opted for retirement after three seasons. While Ms. McKenzie's portrayal of Miss Marple  differs from that of Ms. McEwan's, it is equally good, just different. Instead of a physically slight, wispy Ms. Marple, we now have a sturdy, physically robust one. As before, Miss Marple continues to be a highly intelligent woman and a shrewd observer of human nature.

In season four, the writers continue to have the adaptations set in the 1950s, which makes sense for purpose of continuity for the small screen. Unfortunately, the writers choose to interject current social mores into their adaptation, so the sense of another time and place really does not work because of the dissonance the writers cause.

Episode one works for the most part, because the core of the story stays relatively true to the original. Unfortunately, in episode two, in which the adaptation  now includes Miss Marple, the story deviates wildly from the original. Not even the inclusion of Benedict Cumberbatch in one of the pivotal roles can save it. The adaptation is simply ludicrous.

Episode three stays relatively close to the original, though it was not one of Dame Christie's best. It also  features a fine  performance by Penelope Littleton, as well as one by Joan Collins. In episode four, the writers include Miss Marple in  their adaptation. They also totally rework the novel in its entirety, turning it into a totally dreadful mish mosh of the original. Not even the inclusion of Miss Marple  can save this adaptation.

Unfortunately, the writers of this series still feel they know better than Dame Christie. They do not merely adapt her work. At times, they indulge in totally rewrites so that the episodes often bear little resemblance to the original upon which they are based. Consequently, their lack of talent does the series a disservice. Purists will probably hate this series, while those unfamiliar with the work of Agatha Christie may love it. I fall somewhere in the middle, deriving a modicum of enjoyment from the series despite some of its decided shortcomings.",1492214400,4,2167,5.011142061281337

The story lines are pure Agatha Christy  and would not measure up to today's detective shows with modern forensics but it is the period setting of the shows and the naive charm of the villages which make it spellbinding . I love seeing the English countryside and scenery with the great manor houses, vicarages and small villages . I try to determine the actual settings of the episodes as many of them look familiar. It's typical British TV which is  slower paced than American series. I'm dreading getting to t he end of the series.",1484697600,,598,4.632075471698113

3815191,3,B001UWOLQG,"The producers of this rendition have seen fit to rewrite Christie's plots.  For season 4 they've decided to introduce Miss Marple into stories to which she does not belong.  Charming though Julia McKenzie's portrayal is, the spinster feels intrusive.  The producers might instead have taken The Tuesday Club Murders and spun them into a connected series--but they might have been tempted to splice two or more together into a single episode.
The casts are always well chosen.  The settings and the costumes look right.  What's left of Christie's plots generally is intriguing.  But the whole is much less than the sum of its parts.",1466812800,,631,5.019230769230769

3815299,5,B001UWOLQG,I became an instant fan of British actress Julia McKenzie because she is truly convincing as Miss Marple.  Enjoy watching Agatha Christie's mystery movies since there really isn't anything else on TV or at the movies that is as superbly written and interesting and so enjoyable to watch.

3815449,1,B001UWOLQG,"These are for people who never read Agatha Christie.  Anyone who has read the original stories will be understandably offended, both by the horrible portrayal of Miss Marple and by the ham-handed butchery of the titles themselves.  Apparently unsatisfied with their hatchet job on the Miss Marple stories, the authors of this dog's breakfast also decided to ruin several other titles in which Miss Marple never appeared.

If you're interested in seeing the Miss Marple stories as written by Christie and played perfectly, then get the 1980ish Miss Marple series starring Joan Hickson.

On their own, these rewrites are terrible and if they weren't associated (misleadingly imho) with Agatha Christie by title and character names (in some, but not all cases) they wouldn't draw an audience.",1424649600,,789,5.238095238095238

In one of the episodes Benedict Cumberbatch helps lead the tale believably by being in aide of Miss Marple. He plays a former police chief come home to his late mothers estate.  Excellent characters all.  You always wonder though, how so many murders could occur without getting caught earlier on, as it is in so many fun to watch mysteries.  The fun is trying to figure out ""who"" then seeing who will be the first to realize it anf if they'll too be murdered!  This dosent let down.

Fascinating author, Agatha Christi, same intriguing mysteries, but where is Geraldine McEwan her ""real sleuth""?
For me, and I am sure many viewers would agree with me, it is not the same.
You associate the same person, same manners she has, same facial expressions, same twinkle of an eye and for whatever reasons Geraldine McEwan

3815730,4,B001UWOLQG,"Four stars for originality.  Julia McKenzie is great as Miss Marple, though the show sometimes has so many characters and turns and twists that even though Miss Marple explains it all at the end, it's hard to follow.  Great British show, however.  I like it.",1405123200,,258,4.688888888888889

3815778,4,B001UWOLQG,"While I loved Geraldine McEwan in the title role of Marple, Julie Makenzie steps into the character with her own touch of knowing empathy. I don't know if the episodes are following the chronology of Christie's publications but the plot lines in this season become more complex. On occasion, they even change ""who did it"" from the book version. Like other well-loved series, it attracts top-notch actors who obviously love the stories and render their characters with great care. Given that Christie wrote earlier in the 20th century, the stories are less sophisticated in some ways than more contemporary mystery series but still have the power to grab your attention and hold it to the end.",1404086400,,692,4.974137931034483
3815779,4,B001UWOLQG,I love this series and have fallen in live with Agatha Christie.  The plots contine to be top knotch.  I do have to say that I enjoyed the first Miss Marple much better and wished they had continued with the original actress.,1403568000,,225,4.333333333333333

Not to take away from Geraldine McEwan's acting.she seems like a nice lady and I'm sure is a great actress.  I just could relate better to the Julia McKenzie Character.  Now I want to see season 5..but on Amazon you have to pay for season 5.that is disheartening, since I already pay 80 for the year membership.  But I was lucky to find it elsewhere and look forward to watching it.  I would say that is the only thing I find against Amazon, is that other ""video sites"" have cheaper monthly/yearly fees and  have more seasons available (and more recent seasons available) for less price than buying one season here.  So I'm going to have to be unfaithful to amazon, and go see all my ""british"" shows for cheaper elsewhere.

3815834,5,B001UWOLQG,"This is such a great series, and it became even better when the main character changed.  So unusual for a TV show, yet BBC pulled it off well!  It is an older series, but still just as interesting.  Thank you Amazon, but I would like to see ALL the seasons under Amazon Prime.  The series has been  discontinued for several, but only the first few years are eligible for prime.  That happens often, but wish they would update their inventory!",1401580800,,442,4.4625

3815836,1,B001UWOLQG,"I enjoyed sharing the Geraldine McEwan version of Miss Marple with my children so much that I looked forward to another season to watch together.  How disappointed I am!  This Miss Marple is so much more wooden and humorless than the other version, but even that pales to the differences in the cinematography and scripts! The filming is darker, with the resulting muddying of the image on the screen. And the scripts did not keep the atmosphere of the books at all.

Further,  I watch with my children, and right off, this season's first episode had TWO scenes of gratuitous and rough sex (I'm no shrinking violet but I was offended by useless sex scenes added to spice it up rather than further the story!) and a bedroom scene far more graphic than needed. NOT the viewing fare I had come to appreciate in the first three seasons! What is more, this season had other sex scenes, not essential to the storylines at all, that were totally inappropriate for children. If you watch as a family, skip this season!",1400976000,3,1010,4.625698324022347

This season has shown a darker side with multiple murders, and even a heroine addicted mother as the Lady of the Manor.  We can watch these kind of plots on regular TV.

Julie McKenzie is a perfect Miss Marple.  My particular favorite for this season was the episode ""Murder Is Easy"" with Benedict Cumberbatch as a co-star.  However, the entire series (seasons one through five) is excellent as are most BBC/PBS shows.  I would highly recommend this show!",1393459200,,442,4.8533333333333335

3816179,5,B001UWOLQG,We enjoy seeing Juila McKenzie bring Miss Marple to life. She does not portray Miss Marple as a doddering old lady.  But as an intelligent fun busybody,1392768000,,151,4.592592592592593
3816180,3,B001UWOLQG,"Like most of Julia McKenzie's Marple series, this is very little like the book.  Which it couldn't be since Miss Marple wasn't in Christie's  book anyway.
The story is VASTLY different adding a few dramatic horrors in the end and made the whole story one to take in if (and only if) you're not familiar with Christie's original.
Since I haven't read ""Murder Is Easy"" in a while, and I'm familiar with the laughable liberties this series takes with Christie's work, I was able to watch it.  But even Benedict Cumberbatch couldn't make this episode very good.  It gets an ""okay"" from me since it's not too horrible.  Still, it's risky and stupid to mess with the original.  For the life of me, I can't think why they would.",1392595200,,721,4.550387596899225
3816181,5,B001UWOLQG,"I LOVE this series and specifically, the season with Julia McKenzie. I just adore her as Marple above all. Can someone please have the cast of Downton Abby recreate an Agatha Christie?!",1392508800,,185,4.8125

3816184,4,B001UWOLQG,"The picture quality is excellent; the reason I did not gave it 5 stars is because de video stops frequently because of ""roaming"" . It is really annoying.

3816187,5,B001UWOLQG,Not necessarily the best mystery but it kept you intrigued until the end and the storyline was quite good. This is my favorite actress for Miss Marple. Originally I only watched it because it had Benedict Cumberbatch in it (love him!) and he was quite good as well. Watch it. It's worth it.,1391990400,,290,4.490566037735849
3816188,5,B001UWOLQG,I love anything Agatha Christie and when this new Miss Marple appeared I was wondering if it would be as good as in the past.  I prefer Geraldine McCuen in the roll but Julia does a good job and once you get used to the change and see the new perspective of the same great stories the series is just as good.  Just don't expect them to be the same which is probably a good thing.,1391817600,,379,3.973684210526316

3816255,5,B001UWOLQG,This series moves a little faster than some interpretations. More attention to color/music works....but most of all Miss Marple is less quirky and more forceful....great series.,1390262400,,177,5.846153846153846
3816256,5,B001UWOLQG,What a nice journey into the quiet English countryside of Miss Marple.  The scenery and sets alone are worth the journey.  I had not seen or read this one and was pleasantly surprised by the ending. A lovely experience.,1390176000,2,219,4.589743589743589

3816291,5,B001UWOLQG,My husband and I would try to solve the mystery along with Miss Marple. We would plan a night and have a bowl of popcorn at the ready. We were so ready for season 5 and were so very disappointed  that it would cost extra money even though the series is several years old. That makes no sense at all. So.....we won't be watching season 5. We pay enough for amazon prime.,1389225600,,369,4.125

3816293,5,B001UWOLQG,"I loved Geraldine McEwan as Jane Marple and couldn't see anyone taking over the role.  But I have to admit that I like Julia McKenzie every bit as much.  I think she does a splendid job (even if her Jane is sturdier than most).  The four stories presented in this set range from great (A Pocket Full of Rye) to fair (a confusing mishmash of hysteria in Why Didn't They Ask Evans? which isn't even a Jane Marple story originally).  Since I like mysteries and I like Jane Marple I tend to overlook all the tampering that's been done to Christie's work.  It's shameful, this obvious lack of faithfulness to her books, but I find myself obliged to like them anyway (and not feel disloyal).  Best guest star of the bunch has to be the fabulous Joan Collins, full of bite and backbone.  I'm looking forward to buying series 5.",1388880000,,820,4.426666666666667

3816296,5,B001UWOLQG,"MISS MARPLE AS PLAYED, OR RATHER INCARNATED, BY JULIA McKENZIE IS THE BEST ONE I HAVE SEEN. I DO NOT BELIEVE THE MORE RECENT VERSIONS OF MISS MARPLE TRULY MIRROR WHAT AGATHA CHRISTIE WAS TRYING TO DEPICT. NOW I REALIZE THAT CHOOSING FAVORITES IS LIKE THE OLD SAYING, ""ABOUT MATTERS OF TASTE, THERE IS NO ARGUMENT.""

3816298,5,B001UWOLQG,"Just like all t.v. series that have had a switch in a major character's role, it took me a bit of time to adjust to the 'new' Miss Marple. But, the scripts were often just as complex as in the first sreies. The mystery was just as deadly.  Julia McKenzie does not try to copy her predecessor's mannerisms, but brings her own elderly Miss Marple to the screen with her own sweet smiles and witty, dry humor. I enjoyed this new set of mystery series with its new starring lady!",1387584000,,475,4.277777777777778

3816339,2,B001UWOLQG,"Series 2 and Series 4 both make a big mistake in my opinion. The producer and director know the plot lines of the story, but forget that the viewers do not. Consequently, the stories are cut up, disjointed and difficult to follow. The viewer is left with too many questions. Who did that? How'd that happen. What happened to her? etc. Poor presentations.

Another problem that adds to the confusion is that the dialogue can't be heard; not even with TV Ears. Either the characters speak too softly or too quickly or the background music drowns out the dialogue.

Not watching others of this series.",1379808000,,598,4.685714285714286

3816347,5,B001UWOLQG,"I love Agatha Christie and have read most of her works.  Julia McKenzie plays a younger more solid version of Miss Marple but with the wonderful unlying knowledge of exactly what is going on so you don't have to face the mystery alone.  Though the Miss Marple series played by Joan Hickson WAS Agatha CHristie ( Joan Hickson was the quinessential Miss Marple-just as Christie described her in the novels) and her version followed the novels exactly, these Marple episodes have something a little off from the novels.  You cant be sure, just because you have memorized the books that you will know who-done-it before anyone else because everything has changed.  Couples who originally got along, now dont.  Endings you remember word for word in other versions.....never happen here.  Be prepared to enjoy these versions of Christie favorites whether you love by the book or love some creative alterations.",1378339200,,904,5.033557046979865

3816424,2,B001UWOLQG,"In the one episode I watched -- Murder is Easy -- the screenwriter made a total hash out of the story, injecting all sorts of variations and totally rewriting the killer's motive (and very badly). Why would you take a mystery written by one of the premiere puzzle-masters in the world, and try and ""improve"" on it? Agatha Christie fans will not enjoy this.

3816426,1,B001UWOLQG,"We actually did not watch it. At the very beginning of the first one, came a vulgar scene.  So we turned it off and deleted it.  Miss Marple played by Joan Hickson spoiled us.  They are clean and stick close to Agatha Chrisie's books. Can't say the same for Julia Mckenzie or Gearldean  McElwain.",1370995200,4,296,4.425925925925926
3816427,5,B001UWOLQG,"The new Miss Marple series started off badly, to my mind, changing so much of the story line for those of us who have read the books. One of the stories even brought together two of Agatha Christie's heroines who were never together in the books.  Also, Miss Marple was inserted into a story she didn't appear in, in the book.

However, when they changed the lead actress to Julia McKenzie, she was much closer to the Miss Marple character than the original actress and the stories seemed to stay closer to the books.  If you liked the old series but were disappointed in the new one, give it another try with Julia McKenzie.  I think you will like it better.",1370995200,,659,4.421487603305785

I've enjoyed both and Julia McKenzie's portrayal of Miss Marple is a bit different than McEwan's, but both actresses do a fine job.

If you're like me, you don't necessarily have to start in series order, unless the change in actress is too disruptive for your suspension of disbelief, because each episode in the series is like a stand-alone movie.

This set features great guest spots featuring Joan Collins and Benedict Cumberbatch, who is starring in his own series as the new incarnation of Sherlock Holmes (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherlock-Season-One-Blu-ray/dp/B004132I20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherlock: Season One [Blu-ray</a>]), among others, and it takes place in the time period shortly after WW2.

I think the scenery and the cinematography, as well as wardrobe, is gorgeously done and never once looks anachronistic or faked. Also, I really wanted to get this series 4 on Blu-Ray, but I hardly notice the difference, meaning that resolution is just fine on DVD.

The only thing that this set is lacking is extras but they do provide text bios on Agatha Christie and Julia McKenzie, and each DVD contains photo gallery and features some of the cast members' filmograhies. There's also subtitles for the hearing impaired.

Not being very familiar with the Christie novels these movies are based on, I can't speak to whether or not they've been rewritten or butchered. I can say that I found each one very entertaining and wasn't bothered in the least with the camera techniques which seemed to put off another reviewer. When I read that review, I was expecting lightning fast editing like in the drug scenes in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Requiem-for-a-Dream-Director-s-Cut/dp/B00005Q4CS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Requiem for a Dream (Director's Cut)</a>, but they weren't like that at all.

3816549,5,B001UWOLQG,"Let me establish things in writing this review. First, I've only read one Miss Marple story, and that wasn't in this collection. Second, the only other actress I've seen playing Miss Marple prior to seeing this collection was Angela Lansbury in the theatrical version of ""The Mirror Cracked"". So my perspective will be different from one who either read the books or is more familiar with another actress. (By the way, just before writing this review, I've seen one with Geraldine McEwan, and I like Julia McKenzie better.)

The four movies in this are ""Pocket Full Of Rye"", ""Murder Is Easy"", ""They Do It With Mirrors"", and ""Why Didn't They Ask Evans?"" All of them are what you expect: Great acting, numerous suspects, plenty of plot turns, and an abundance of English accents. One thing I'll mention that I think this is better than Poirot: It doesn't always reach the climax by gathering all the suspects in a room and having Marple reveal who did it. I like this variety.

I'll admit there are things I didn't like about some of them. ""Pocket Full of Rye"" felt the need to have two sex scenes in it. ""Why Didn't They Ask Evans"" had a couple of gross scenes. Those things aren't necessary in the story. But I didn't allow that to quench my interest in the story.

One other item I'll confess to: Julia McKenzie's interpretation did remind me of Angela Lansbury. Not so much Angela's role as Miss Marple, but rather as Jessica Fletcher (Murder She Wrote). To be honest, that was a plus. It added to the comfort of watching the story.",1359849600,,1534,4.611721611721611

3816553,4,B001UWOLQG,"The fourth series of the new MARPLE, this time starring the delightful Julia McKenzie (""Fresh Fields"", ""Cranford""), who takes up where Geraldine McEwan left off as the octogenarian super-sleuth, Jane Marple.  Practically all of the McEwan/McKenzie ""Marple"" adventures have severely divided Agatha Christie fans, chiefly for playing around with the original stories (often putting Miss Marple into A.C. books that she wasn't even featured in).  This set includes two more ""re-writes"", which I've marked with a *.  All things considered, however, these new ""Marple""'s are enjoyable enough; if nothing else they are beautifully-designed and furnished with many British acting greats who play their roles with glee.

Most importantly, Julia McKenzie's Marple is markedly different to Geraldine McEwan's earlier portrayal of the role.  McKenzie's Marple is a more benign presence, dressed in conservative tweeds, but by the same token isn't afraid to push herself into uncomfortable situations despite being labelled a ""meddling old busybody"".  By contrast, McEwan's Marple was almost a bohemian creature, dressed in oversized cardigans and crumpled hats.  By using a veil of vagueness to disguise her sharp intellect, many a murderer underestimated her at their peril.

Julia McKenzie is much closer in spirit to Hickson's Marple, which may have been one of the reasons why producers decided to cast her in the part, hoping to lure back fans who'd been a little disappointed with the first three rounds of episodes with McEwan.

Includes:

THEY DO IT WITH MIRRORS - After lunching with old friend Ruth Van Rydock (Joan Collins), Jane is asked to visit Ruth's sister Carrie-Louise Serrocold (Penelope Wilton), whom she believes is being targeted by a murderer.  The suspects include Carrie-Louise's considerable collection of ex-husbands and stepchildren, not to mention the entire populace of a prison reform farm located near the Serrocold estate.

Guest stars: Ian Ogilvy, Brian Cox, Maxine Peake, Elliot Cowan, Sarah Smart and Emma Griffiths Malin.

WHY DIDN'T THEY ASK EVANS?* - After stumbling across a dying man, whose last words are ""Why didn't they ask Evans?"", Bobby Attfield (Sean Biggerstaff) is deliberately given the wrong address of the inquest at which he is asked to appear, and is later chased down by a car whilst cycling along a deserted country lane.  Convinced there is something suspicious afoot, Bobby teams up with madcap socialite Frankie Derwent (Georgia Moffett), and together with Jane's help, they travel to the mysterious Castle Savage...

Guest stars: Samantha Bond, Richard Briers, Freddie Fox, Rik Mayall, Rafe Spall, Helen Lederer, Natalie Dormer, David Buchanan and Siwan Morris.

MURDER IS EASY* - On a train, Jane meets by chance Lavinia Pinkerton (Sylvia Syms), who is on her way to Scotland Yard to report what she believes to be an unfolding series of murders in her small village of Wychwood.  When she doesn't make it to her destination, Jane takes up the case herself, passing herself off as one of Miss Pinkerton's old friends.  With the help of Luke Fitzwilliam (Benedict Cumberbatch) and young police officer Terence Reed (Russell Tovey), Jane must piece together the cryptic web of blackmail and scandal that binds together several of Wychwood's residents.

Guest stars: Anna Chancellor, Shirley Henderson, David Haig, Tim Brooke-Taylor, Jemma Redgrave, Lyndsey Marshal, Steve Pemberton and Margo Stillney.

A POCKET FULL OF RYE - Jane's interest in the apparent murder of millionaire London businessman Rex Fortescue (Kenneth Cranham) takes on a more personal meaning when she discovers that Gladys (Rose Heiney), a young woman from St Mary Mead whom she recently trained as a domestic, is now working for the Fortescue family.  As Fortescue's children squabble over their entitlements and the body-count rises, Jane teams with Inspector Neele (Matthew Macfadyen) to uncover the significance of the old nursery poem ""A pocket full of rye"" in Fortescue's death.

Guest stars: Prunella Scales, Wendy Richard, Rupert Graves, Lucy Cohu, Helen Baxendale, Hattie Morahan, Ben Miles, Anna Madeley, Laura Haddock and Edward Tudor-Pole.",1339027200,,4171,5.404320987654321

Given the tendency of ITV to drastically alter Christie's plots, characters and general tone, this was probably not a good thing.

Miss Marple is on a train bound for London when she strikes up a conversation with the woman sitting opposite her. Mrs Pinkerton is on her way to Scotland Yard with a strange story to report: she believes that there's a murderer on the loose in her little village of Wychwood, and what's more: she knows who's next on the killer's hit-list. Miss Marple is troubled by this story, all the more so when she reads about Mrs Pinkerton's death in the newspaper the following day. She never reached Scotland Yard, but was pushed down an escalator at the train station.

Miss Marple decides to investigate further, and arrives at Wychwood in time for Mrs Pinkerton's funeral. Striking up a friendship with Luke Fitzwilliam, an ex-police officer, the two of them begin to investigate the string of mysterious deaths in the village.

As with many other of the 90-minute movies in this series, ""Murder is Easy"" diverges drastically from the source material - the most blatant addition being Miss Marple herself! For the record, I'm not a purist. I don't mind if these stories are changed around a bit, and in fact I've enjoyed the ones that have, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sittaford-Mystery/dp/B0073J7STC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sittaford Mystery</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/By-the-Pricking-of-My-Thumbs/dp/B0073J63R0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">By the Pricking of My Thumbs</a>, both based on mysteries that were probably too slight to translate nicely into a 90 minute movie. But if you're going to change the source material, you should make sure that you're changing it for the better, or for a good reason. This doesn't. The divergences from the original novel are either bad or inexplicable, and even if you *could* excuse the disregard for Christie's work, ""Murder is Easy"" doesn't really hold up on its own terms either.

Dozens of characters are introduced in quick succession and in such generic ways that it is quite difficult to keep track of them all. Some are given such heavy-handed quirks that it becomes irritating - one girl spent every scene violently coughing to remind us of her ill health, so much so that it was a blessed relief when she finally died. The usual ""modern sensibilities"" have been added: passionate (and pointless) kissing in hallways, crude innuendoes, drunken slurring, secret abortions, incestuous rape by a mentally challenged brother - yeesh! Christie would hate this stuff - no matter how dark her subject matter, she never resorted to this level of gratuitousness.

For the last two series Julia McKenzie has taken over from Geraldine McEwan as the spinster-detective. I know that McEwan's performance as Miss Marple was somewhat controversial, but it was also entertaining: her Bohemian clothes, her high, trilling voice, her sweet, fluffy exterior that could turn steely at a moment's notice - say what you will about her take on the character; you can't say that it was dull. Here, Julia McKenzie is impossibly bland, though I suspect that has as much to do with the screenplay as the performance (and yes, I do feel immensely mean in criticizing a sweet little old lady). This Miss Marple is an observer and a sounding board, not an instigator. Because of the drastic changes in the plot, her deductions are not based on observation of human nature or her usual technique of forming analogies between suspects and her acquaintances in Saint Mary Mead. Instead, they seem to be plucked out of thin air, and most of the time she seems superfluous (presumably because this isn't even a Marple mystery - in the book, Luke was the sole protagonist).

However, one of the fun things about this series is the host of familiar faces.  Perhaps most surprisingly, Benedict Cumberbatch is present as Luke Fitzwilliam. At the time this was shot he was a relative unknown; now he's unmistakable as Sherlock Holmes in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BBC-modern-adaptation/dp/B004132HZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BBC modern adaptation</a>. Shirley Henderson has done the rounds on British television, but is probably most recognizable as Moaning Myrtle in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-films/dp/B005OCFGTO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter films</a>, as well Anna Chancellor (Miss Bingley) from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pride-and-Prejudice/dp/B00364K6YW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pride and Prejudice</a>, Russell Tovey (George) from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Being-Human/dp/B003IMERF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Being Human</a>, and Lyndsey Marshall (Cleopatra) from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rome/dp/B0028RXXE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rome</a>.

In the book, most of the murders took place before Luke arrived at the village. Understandably, all of them (and a few more) happen on-screen in the adaptation, all whilst Marple is staying in the area. This however, is the only change I could understand.

The atmosphere of Wychwood-Under-Ashe is in its name: a place of dark cliffs, forested walks, ancient houses - but here it's just another English village. Heck, Miss Marple even states at one point that one village is very much like another. No kidding. Witch-like, mysterious Bridget is now a vapid American. Giles Ellsworthy, one of the book's most interesting characters, is gone completely. Also missing is Lord Whitfield, strangely enough, as not only was Whitfield a colorful character in his own right, but the pompous man-child was actually the killer's impetus! Without him, the motivation has been changed entirely.

But I saw a trailer with Julia McKenzie in it and thought it looked pretty good so I bought Season 4.  I was pretty excited as I watched ""Pocket Full of Rye"" since it was shaping up to be as good, or even better, than the Joan Hickson version.  They did a great job of building up our distrust of the rogue son from Paris while never allowing us to suspect the real murderer, just like the book.  Whoa!  The reason is that in this rewrite, the most obvious red herring, the son, IS the murderer.  Marple reveals it with only circumstantial evidence and that's the end of the show.  What happened to the exposure of the real murderer?

The plot device leading to the discovery of the real murderer is admittedly as old as the hills. In fact, Agatha Christie also used it in Hercule Poirot's Christmas; and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle even used it in Sherlock Holmes' Hound of the Baskervilles. That proves that it can't be so bad that it must be left out. There was just no satisfaction of a solved mystery at the end of this production.

I did decide to go ahead and try another episode since I liked Julia McKenzie's portrayal of Miss Marple, and every other aspect of the production besides the plot was excellent.  Christian Gulbrandsen gets knifed very early in ""They Do It With Mirrors"". Yes, I said ""knifed"". For anyone who doubts that these plots have been ruined, not adapted, be aware that the entire plot twist and clue to the murderer in this mystery depends upon him being shot.  ""They do it with mirrors"" in the title refers to mis-direction and play-acting. It is impossible for the plot to be saved if Christian is killed by knife.  Sorry, I couldn't watch any more.

Mysteries are all about the plot, so the high quality of the other facets of this production cannot bring up the rating.",1284940800,11,1900,4.409742120343839
3816579,3,B001UWOLQG,"I have the Miss Marple DVD series' with both Joan Hickson and Geraldine McEwan. I love both interpretations of Marple, though they are strikingly different. Julia McKenzie, though a wonderful actress, makes a rather boring Marple after the mischievous McEwan. That wouldn't be so bad if these new productions hadn't taken such liberties with story lines. Some not as bad as others but still: distracting!

THE GOOD
1.  A Pocket Full of Rye:
  - Matthew Macfadyen as the detective. Fun to see him not as breathtakingly attractive as he was in Pride and Prejudice.
2.  Murder in Easy:
  - The dreamy Benedict Cumberbatch as Luke Fitzwilliam;
  - The hilarious Shirley Henderson (of Harry Potter fame as Moaning Myrtle) as Honoria Waynflete, a rather serious role;
3.  They Do it with Mirrors:
  - Joan Collins in a small role. Rather irritating but fun to see her again;
4.  Why Didn't They Ask Evans?
  - The dreamy Sean Biggerstaff (of Harry Potter fame as Oliver Wood) as Bobby;
  - Mark Williams (of Harry Potter fame as Arthur Weasley) as a less than sympathetic character;

THE BAD
1.  Extras:
  - None of the DVD's have enough Castographies. They show maybe 4 per DVD, each of which includes McKensie, so you really only get 3 other cast members per DVD. And often it doesn't even include the main co-stars!
2.  Murder is Easy:
  - Liberties taken with characters, subplots, and motives;
  - Marple was not in the original story. Fitzwilliam was the one who met Miss Pinkerton on the train;
3.  They Do it with Mirrors:
  - Liberties taken with characters and relationships;
  - I've never liked this story much, but perhaps that's just me;
4.  Why Didn't They Ask Evans?
  - Marple was not in the original story. The main sleuths were Bobby and Frankie;
  - MAJOR liberties with the story line. The whole China connection? Never happened.
  - Georgia Moffett as Frankie is rather spoiled and unlikeable. It's been a while since I read the original story so I'm not sure if she's written that way or it's an unfortunate interpretation.

I re-watch my Marple DVD's over and over again but I'm not so inclined with these stories. They're okay once but not as addicting as the Hickson or McEwan portrayals.",1283558400,9,2208,4.725593667546174
3816580,1,B001UWOLQG,"Pixieish Geraldine McKewan is gone and in her place we have bland Julia Mckenzie.  I have a feeling Mckenzie was cast as Miss Marple based on her delightful work in ""Cranford,"" but as Miss Marple she is tentative and dull. Sure, McKewan was nothing like the actual Miss Marple created by Christie, but Mckenzie is simply boring.  Joan Hickson remains the perfect Miss Marple, though the eighties/nineties films she starred in seem a bit slow and stodgy by today's standards.  Yet Hickson is the only one who comes off believably as a genteel lady of the Victorian/Edwardian era.  Younger people seem to find Hickson's Marple too forbidding and severe, but that formality is what was once known as being ladylike and having breeding.  Underneath Miss Marple's reserve, however, was kindness, humor, and lively curiosity, and Hickson perfectly captures all this.

As for the films themselves, they range from adaptations of books where Miss Marple never appeared, which involves tampering with plots to the point of incomprehensibility (Why Didn't They Ask Evans?), to those where significant, tarted-up alterations are made, false to the creative spirit of the author (Murder Is Easy), to fairly faithful versions, as far as plot is concerned, that are treated in an excruciatingly arch, campy manner, with cartoon-like filming techniques (A Pocket Full of Rye).  There is no way that Christie would have approved of any of this nonsense, whatever her grandson may say.

It's all a shame, because the Hickson Marples were not perfect.  I would have loved to have seen modern, faithful versions of the books, even if they couldn't find as good a Miss Marple as the late Ms. Hickson.  Many of the Suchet Poirots are still excellent, but perhaps Suchet has some of the artistic integrity quite evidently lacking in the people behind the modern Marple series.",1274572800,44,1854,5.069078947368421

Such license takes away from the story every time.  ""Why Didn't They Ask Evans"" doesn't even pretend to follow the Agatha Christie novel past the names of the characters and a few general talking points.  As anybody knows, Miss Marple didn't even appear in that novel. I felt the same way about Miss Marple being in the movie as Frankie Derwent apparently did.  What is she doing here!!?

I know the last two Miss Marple's solely from DVD so that there was no gradual getting used to the new characterizations that different actresses are bound to impose on a play. I did not feel that Mckewan fit the Christie model nearly as well as did Joan hickson. With Julia McKenzie, it seems to me, we have lost all  connection to the elderly woman from a small village. In addition, the video plays are neither as well written nor as well directed as the original series. They are neither modern cozy nor Christie nostalgic with a core of steel to them. Neither the Poirot nor Christie series maintained the intensity of tension and vigorous action of the contemporary detective story. Instead, they offered a strong sense of period and idiosyncratic characters played with excellence.

4.  Some of the upper crust Brits have culturally lower class confrontive behavior and unnecessary foul language.
5.  The plots are simplified so as to not stress the intelligence of a twelve year old or an adult body with a twelve year old mind. The clues are presented with blatant emphasis.

3816639,5,B001UWOLQG,"Each actress who takes on the mantle of 'Miss Marple' brings something of herself and her unique qualities to the role, and Julia McKenzie is no exception. She is definitely prettier than Margaret Rutherford, softer and more grandmotherly than Joan Hickson, less crochety than Helen Hayes, and more introverted than Geraldine McEwan. With every fictional character (even Shakespeare's), an actor is left to bring their own interpretation to the part, no matter what anyone else thinks. So I applaud Julia McKenzie's courage in tackling a character so well beloved. When these later series arrived, I never thought I would switch my allegiance from Joan Hickson, but I was soon won over by Geraldine McEwan - it's the humor and the twinkle in McEwan's eye that makes her such a good Marple. However, I have liked Julia McKenzie in other things and I must admit I like her Marple too. McKenzie plays Marple as the type of wonderful listener that all the suspects reveal themselves to, precisely because she lets them talk until they say something important.

I bought this series without even knowing which books they were doing and I am not disappointed. The sets and the care with which these productions are done is worth the price of the set. I was glad to see that they were trying to be a little more faithful to Agatha Christie. They went totally off the rails in 'At Bertram's Hotel' in the last series, you almost needed a flow-chart to keep track of everyone (but the sets were gorgeous).

As far as the two 'non-Marple' episodes go, I like 'Murder is Easy' better with Marple in it - I don't think that anyone is going to argue that the last production (with Bill Bixby)is more faithful to the original. And you have to admit that if you want to see ""Evans"" as originally written, you have the opportunity as it has already been wonderfully done by James Warwick and Francesca Annis. Another plus is seeing all the great British actors (a la 'Murder She Wrote') in all the episodes.

Being a forty-year fan of Agatha Christie and having read all of her mysteries, I think she would have had a problem with the 'sex scenes' and some of the 'creative direction'. But I think she would have liked Julia McKenzie, and I do too.",1249430400,13,2232,4.674300254452926
3816640,4,B001UWOLQG,"My first response to a new Marple series was....

Why?

Joan Hickson did it to perfection in all 12 novel stories! Sure, the picture quality of her episodes leaves much to be desired. The colors are washed out, the picture is grainy & the sound is muffled. Better money would be spent to clean these up to meet current broadcast quality standards, than to re-do the stories with new actresses.  Yes the picture is great here, fitted for widescreen TVs with crisp audio & subtitles.

But like the Geraldine series, we will get two new Christie story dramatizations with this set.  And THAT IS THE REASON TO BUY THIS. Sure they are non-Marple stories re-written to put Jane Marple in them, but today that is the only way we will see these stories go into production.  A known name character is needed to push the project through.  Christie purists are cringing at this idea, but I understand the necessity.  And if you did not now the original story, I doubt you could tell the insertion of the new character.

Unlike Geraldine, Julia McKenzie is a rather unknown actress to me. So I came to this series with some curiosity & uncertainty.

POCKET FULL OF RYE seems to be directed by someone who drank too much coffee. It felt more like a spoof than a serious mystery. Like watching the movie ""Clue"", it all felt like a put-on. The quick zooms to dead bodies & angled camera positioning all felt over dramatic.  Instead of letting Agatha Christie's story create the tension, the director tried to use cinematography techniques to bring it on.  Quite honestly, if felt like someone fresh out of college was given a camera & budget to make this film.  The story is only saved by Julia McKenzie's performance & over all good production values (directing aside).

The second episode, MURDER IS EASY, was totally different. That episode felt more like a classic Joan Hickson episode. Julie seemed to be channeling Joan for her performance here.  Miss Marple never appeared in the original story, a retired out-of town police detective is the original main character in the book. But here he is relegated to the side-kick of Jane Marple.  Jane is put in his place in most scenes, except at the Coroner's inquest.  In that scene someone of professional background is needed to convince the coroner it might be murder, so the original character from the book is kept around.  The director of this episode has decided to let Agatha Christie's story create the tension and we are there just to observe what is going on, and maybe try to solve the mystery before Miss Marple. WATCH THIS ONE FIRST!

THEY DO IT WITH MIRRORS returns to a real Miss Marple story, and this production is in fine form.  Julia plays the role as a quiet observer putting the pieces together.  The direction is right on, allowing the story to creat the suspence.  The characters seem to be better developed than in the provious two episodes. The story does not suffer from being compressed to 90 minutes.  This comes the closest to a Joan Hickson performance in the entire collection of this series.

Inserting Miss Marple into WHY DIDN'T THEY ASK EVANS was not as successfully done as in Murder Is Easy.  At first she seems surprisingly un-interested in the mystery around her, not a quiet by-stander, just not interested.  The amature detective young man & lady are the original main characters in the book, and they do take center stage here.  The trouble is that they are very annoying, making the viewing of this story less pleasent.  This adaptation will disappoint on two levels:
Miss Marple fans will not be happy as she takes back stage & is not at her best. Agatha Christie fans will not be happy with the altered story line.
You really want Miss Marple to lock the two amature detectives up in a closet so that they will stop making a mess of things!  I was really looking forward to seeing this adaptation, I think it is the only version of the book produced for the screen.  It is disappointing that it does not work.

The guest cast is a 'who's-who' of talented British character acters.  I found myself playing another mystery game while watching, trying to remember which British production I last saw that actor in.  Unfortunately, the bonus material cast listing does not include enough of the actors, so I was on my own with IMDB.

Over-all, I find it unnecessary to watch the remakes of Joan Hickson episodes, but seeing the two new dramatizations MURDER IS EASY & WHY DIDN'T THEY ASK EVANS makes this set well worth getting.  Even if the last episode is not perfect.

One question to the producers: Why not make episodes based on the Miss Marple short stories?  It worked for Poirot and it is much better than re-doing perfection.",1249257600,7,4712,4.667878787878788
3816641,4,B001UWOLQG,"Series 4 of the controversial ""Marple"" series from Granada/ITV brings us a new Miss Marple, reconceived from the previous seasons, now played by Julia McKenzie. McKenzie's Marple is not as frilly as the classic Joan Hickson or as bohemian as Geraldine McEwan's portrayal. This is a more intellectual, no-nonsense Marple. She wears 3 suits, unadorned and straightforward. And I only saw her knit once. Miss Marple seems less a little old lady and more someone's all-knowing aunt or governess, always ready with whatever is needed and possessed of a strong sense of justice. These episodes avoid the stylization that some previous seasons embraced. Like the new Miss Marple, Series 4 is forthright and conventional in its scripts and production design.

""Marple"" has had no qualms about departing from Agatha Christie's books: rewriting action, characters, even the motives and identity of the culprits, and appropriating other of Christie's novels for the spinster detective. Continuing in that tradition, ""Murder is Easy"" and ""Why Didn't They Ask Evans?"", both non-Marple books, have inspired episodes this season. Sometimes rewrites seem only to make the films more salacious, and, although there was never a premium on plausibility or coherence in Christie's novels, the rewrites have tended not to improve matters, often creating solutions that are quite ridiculous. Marple purists will not like that. But I have noticed that the character writing gains more depth the further it gets from its source.

Ultimately, it's difficult to say how Miss Marple should be adapted for a modern audience. Purists may prefer Joan Hickson's more faithful portrayal from the 1980s. Others, like myself, find Hickson's Marple dreadfully dull but lament this series' tendency to careen full throttle into burlesque. And, if the writers are going to rewrite Christie's stories, could they not improve upon the solutions instead of making them more ridiculous? Unlike Poirot, Marple does not have the distinct visual characteristics of the detective or the interwar milieu to latch onto. It has an elderly lady in gloves and a hat. In the past, this led the producers to toss sexuality into the mix at every turn and experiment with heavy stylization, usually with poor results (""The Moving Finger"" being an exception).

Christie wrote her Marple novels and stories 1927-1971, but the creators of this television series wisely chose to set it in the 1950s, giving it a distinct look and grounding Miss Marple in a particular time. The filmmakers have seemingly tried every trick they could think of to make ""Marple"" interesting and relevant to a contemporary audience. Often those efforts have been laid on rather too thick. My own suggestion would be to capitalize on the post-War prosperity, conformity, and hypocrisy of the 1950s. That decade shares much in common with the 1990s and 2000s. Miss Marple is a woman who has seen the Jazz Age, two global depressions, and two world wars. She's not easily fooled by a bright, respectable faade. Create a subtext along those lines that would comment on our own time without being obviously anachronistic or straying far from the original plots.

After watching ""Marple"" struggle to find its focus for four seasons, those are my 2 cents on the subject. I really don't know how to rate the series. I give it 4 stars, because Julia McKenzie's Miss Marple is personable, sharp, and fun to watch. Some viewers find that she doesn't have enough character, serving more as a device than a detective. But wasn't Geraldine McEwan's Marple irritating and vaguely sinister? If it's not one thing, it's another. The series lacks a cogent vision. Oddly, the first episode this season is adorned with completely superfluous location subtitles. It's one of those things. These are the episodes in Series 4:

""A Pocket Full of Rye""'s killer takes inspiration from the nursery rhyme. Rex Fortescue, president of Consolidation Investments, dies at his office, apparently of poison. In the pocket of his suit, the police find a handful of rye. Inspector Neele (Matthew Macfadyen) interviews the family at their country home, Yewtree Lodge: the deceased's wayward wife Adele (Anna Madeley), eldest son Percyval (Ben Miles), who believed his father's mental health threatened the business, estranged son Lancelot (Rupert Graves), just back from Africa, neurotic daughter-in-law (Liz White), daughter Elaine (Hattie Morahan), who cannot contain her delight at Rex's passing, and Gladys (Rose Heiney), the simple chambermaid previously employed by Miss Marple. Gladys is having trouble getting on in the world.

""Murder Is Easy"" is adapted from a non-Marple novel and heavily rewritten. Miss Marple meets Lavinia Pinkerton (Sylvia Syms) on a London-bound train. Pinkerton is headed for Scotland Yard to report two murders in her home village of Wychwood. ""Murder is easy,"" she says, ""so long as no one thinks it's murder."" She promptly meets her death in Victoria Station. Miss Marple travels to Wychwood and makes the acquaintance of Luke Fitzwilliam (Benedict Cumberhatch), formerly a police detective in Malaya. Together Miss Marple and Fitzwilliam make the rounds of the town's close-knit population in their investigation, as more of the population meets its end. Perhaps it is the rewrite, but the characters seem more authentic, emotions real, and with more dimension than usual.

Miss Marple's glamorous old friend Ruth (Joan Collins) asks the detective to look in on her sister Carrie Louise after a fire struck her home in ""They Do It With Mirrors"". Carrie Louise is a committed philanthropist who runs a reform facility for criminals on her Stoneygates estate with her third husband Lewis Serrocold (Brian Cox) and daughters Gina (Emma Griffiths Malin) and Mildred (Sarah Smart) from her first marriage. With a staff that seems a bit daft, two stepsons with questionable intentions, a group of convicts on their doorstep, and an amateur theatrical in rehearsal, there is a lot of misdirection to be overcome when the antics turn to murder. In contrast with previous episodes, the police detective Inspector Curry (Alex Jennings) seems pretty sharp.

""Why Didn't They Ask Evans?"", inspired by the non-Marple novel, has Miss Marple helping the young detectives along and keeping them out of trouble. Bobby Attfield (Sean Biggerstaff) finds a dying man on a cliff who says as he expires, ""Why didn't' they ask Evans?"" When Bobby is called testify at an inquest that doesn't exist, an adventurous friend, Miss Frankie Derwent (Georgia Moffett), proposes that they investigate the murder themselves. But Miss Marple, who is visiting Bobby's mother, has her eye on the young duo. When Frankie proves too gutsy for her own good, Miss Marple follows her to Castle Savage, home of a quarrelling and rather sinister family whom the dead man recently visited. The plot is exotic and implausible. It suffers further from a cast of annoying characters.",1248912000,78,6960,5.219141323792487
3816642,1,B001UWOLQG,"I am not an Agatha Christie purist and have loved almost all previous incarnations of Miss Marple -- from Margaret Rutherford through to Joan Hickson and Geraldine McEwan. I'm sure Julia McKenzie would be an equally acceptable Marple but I could not stand to watch this series because of the film techniques employed.

Rather than tell a straight forward story, the scenes are choppily edited into fast-video-flash bits, with weird angles and ultra closeups. The sequence is disjointed and hard to follow. For instance, in one scene in ""Murder is Easy"", Miss Marple is at a post-funeral gathering with a large group of other people (all suspects at this stage, of course). Two second snippet of conversation .... close up of Marple's eyes looking around ... two seconds of another out-of-context conversation... another close up of Marple's eyes ... etc etc etc. I felt like screaming ""Okay, we get it... she's listening!""

In the first ten minutes of that episode, a dozen or so different characters are introduced, but so rapidly and with so little context that I am soon bewildered and confused. In addition, they all seem so unpleasant that I didn't really care who was killed or who did the killing!

Perhaps younger viewers, weaned on fast cut editing, enjoy this type of filming more but for those who prefer more leisurely paced and cohesive story telling, this jagged camera work is distracting at best and intrusive at worst.

I noticed the same problem with the new episodes of Poirot. The director and cinematographer obviously had a grand time showing off their techniques, but the stories suffered.

What I don't understand is why these techniques, more suited to fast paced thrillers or action yarns, are used for classic mysteries which depend on character development and plot. Are film makers so afraid we'll lose interest if the camera stands in place for a full minute?",1248739200,126,1889,4.965189873417722
3816643,3,B001UWOLQG,"I was really disappointed when I learned that Geraldine McEwan wasn't returning in Marple #4. Having said that, I have watched this new actress and I'm just not sure if I like her portrayal. Joan Hickson and G. McEwan played the part as the brilliant spinster who observed and unobtrusively helped the police solve the crimes. Ms Mckenzie portrays the part more as a detective, I can't wrap my head around this. I hope she will grow on me.  Normally, I would rate any Miss Marple series with 5 stars, just can't do that with this one. I rated this series with 3 stars with hope that the series will get better.",1248739200,3,610,4.446428571428571
3816644,1,B001UWOLQG,"I am so very disappointed by this last season. Some episodes are only vague shadows of the original stories. Quite underwhelmed by the portrayal Miss Marple as well. Too aggressive, too detective-ish. I never took that away from any of her stories. Christie's work is so good - why do people feel a need to change it so much in translation to screen? The worst is ""Why Didn't They Ask Evans?"" Miss Marple is not even IN the original. If you take this as just a mystery series, it is fair entertainment.",1248652800,58,502,4.467391304347826
3816645,5,B001UWOLQG,"Of all the manifestations that Miss Marple has undergone, to me, Julia Mackenzie captures the essence of that modest, unassuming but perceptive English village spinster in tweeds, gloves, and sensible shoes, who is forever knitting ""fleecy things."" The series also captures the flavor of the rarified atmosphere of week-end house parties of the aristocracy; their cooks and butlers--elements that are so intrinsic to Christie's novels.

The settings and costumes are splendid (The era seems to be in the early fifties, judging by the Capri pants, the strapless dresses with ballerina skirts, and no mention of food shortages.). The ensemble cast of supporting players is excellent; the characters are well defined (It was lovely seeing the late Wendy Richard--""Miss Brahms"" of Grace Brothers--wearing the hat and apron of a cook for one of the Agatha Christie mansions.). The well-crafted mysteries  convey a sense of the originals as I recall them.

As much as I enjoy the work of Geraldine McEwan, I never forgot that she was Geraldine McEwan playing the part of Miss Marple (I think that my biggest complaint about that version of the series was the injection of a romantic past that Christie, as far as I recall, never intimated in the books, which I devoured as a schoolgirl). I had no such reservations with Julia MacKenzie's portrayal, which gives me the feeling that I am curled up in front of an imaginary fireplace, reading the books again. It's a cozy feeling!",1248566400,5,1471,5.045267489711934
8345289,2,B001UWOLQG,"When I was 9 or 10, I had a great aunt who read everything she could get her hands on, but was particularly fond of mysteries, and most especially, Agatha Christie mysteries. I remember her having a bookcase full of them in her house and when she began running out of room for new books, she passed these Christie's down to me, hoping to stimulate my interest in reading. Little did she know how well her ploy would work. By the time I was 14, I'd read most of Christie's books at least once, and have re-read many in the years since. I've always had my own ideas about how certain of her characters should look and present themselves so the casting in movie and TV versions has been interesting. As the first (as far as I know) Miss Marple, Margaret Rutherford wasn't at all what I'd pictured, although she was fun and mischevious, and played the part rather broadly in pictures that were more comedy than mystery. But really, I think Joan Hickson, in the 80's Miss Marple series, nailed the character better than anyone (even though Geraldine McEwen looked more like the character as described in the books). However, Julia McKenzie, in the most recent incarnation, does her own thing as a sturdier, more athletic Miss Marple, and while I don't think she's a physical match for the character, I like her all the same (maybe because she reminds a lot of another great aunt, the sister of the one mentioned above). It's just unfortunate that McKenzie must endure the quartet of misguided miseries that make up this set of discs from Masterpiece Mystery. These British TV movies run 93 minutes each, and all have different screenwriters and directors, none of whom seem ever to have done more than skim through the source material.

First up, The Good (3.5 stars):  ""They Do It With Mirrors"". Joan Collins plays--what else--a rich and glamorous chum from Miss Marple's past. In from New York to visit (and harangue) her sister (Penelope Wilton), Joan suspects someone is slowly poisoning the woman. Enlisting Miss Marple to assess the situation and report back to her, Joan hightails it back to London (don't worry, she shows back up later). As sister Carrie Louise is also a great pal of Miss Marple, she welcomes her into the eccentric, possibly murderous household with nary a thought. These earlier scenes set in the country house are highly entertaining, and have the feel of a Wes Anderson movie by way of ""You Can't Take It With You"". The house's inhabitants are a hoot, that is until murder interferes, and finally, things take a tragic turn. There's a boy's reformatory next door that Carrie Louise's husband runs and it may or may not figure into the plot. With Brian Cox, Nigel Terry and Ian Ogilvy shining in supporting roles, and Alex Jennings and Sean Hughes hilarious as the two inept police inspectors, ""They Do It With Mirrors"" is, in my opinion, the best movie in this set.

Now, The Bad (2 stars): ""A Pocket Full of Rye"". In this poisonous confection, Miss Marple shows up at another country house to investigate the strangulation of her former maid and the poisoning of the Lord of the Manor. Matthew Macfadyen (""Ripper Street"") is on hand as the competent chief inspector who is appreciative of Miss Marple's help; Rupert Graves and Ben Miles are the murdered man's sons, with Lucy Cohu and Liz White as their respective wives; Hattie Morahan is the dead man's daughter and Helen Baxendale is Lauren Bacall-ish as the glamorous housekeeper. With a cast like this, ""A Pocket Full of Rye"" should be much better but the writer's let their cast down at nearly every turn and any excitement to be had is lost in translation. I did, however, enjoy the drunken butler, who seems like an ever-so-slightly less randy relative of the drunken butler played by Boris Karloff in ""The Old Dark House""; when he ogles Miss Marple in his room, you wonder if she'll get out with her virtue intact. It's the first time I've ever seen anyone eye Miss Marple in quite that way, and it's queasy, funny and curiously charming, all at the same time. I also liked the ending that has Miss Marple receiving a surprising discovery in the mail that effectively closes the case.

The Ugly (1 star): ""Why Didn't They Ask Evans?"". This adaptation of Christie's work is all over the place, with so many characters running hither and yon that it's hard to keep track of who's who and what their place is in the story. To be sure, some of these characters didn't occupy a place in the book, as the writers apparently thought it best to omit existing ones in favor of new, less interesting characters. The writers also changed much more, not the least of which is the insertion of Miss Marple, who doesn't even appear in the book. I really don't have a huge problem with Marple's intrusive presence here, although the introduction of her character into the action is ham-handed and feels really awkward. ""Why Didn't They Ask Evans?"" starts out promisingly with an attractive pair of bored, rich, attractive young things thinking it would be a hoot to solve a murder, a decision they soon regret. Steered to the ubiquitous country house, they meet a group of ubiquitous eccentrics, though this bunch is considerably less fun than those in the previously mentioned film. Next door is a sanitarium run by a shifty doctor (Rik Mayall) who seems to keep his nervously gorgeous wife (Natalie Dormer) under lock and key. Of course, murder happens, and it's up to Miss Marple to save the day. The highly capable Samantha Bond plays the perpetually out-of-it lady of the house and Rafe Spall is the house pianist(?). Sean Biggerstaff and Georgia Moffett are also good as the two self-appointed young investigators, and the rest of the enormous cast moves in and out of scenes with shifty-eyed gravitas. All for naught as it's hard to make heads or tails of who's doing what to who, and even harder to care.

The Really Ugly (0.5 stars): ""Murder Is Easy"". I must admit that ""Murder Is Easy"" is in my top 5 Christie favorites so to see what the screenwriters did to this had me more than a little miffed. To put it mildly. Once again, I didn't so much mind them injecting Miss Marple into the proceedings (she was not present in the novel) although she seems ingratiatingly nosy here as well as terribly out-of-place. However, the elimination of key characters from the book and the creation of new ones is very grating, and the changing of the killer's motive and background is stupid and unforgivable, as is the entirely new climax which completely robs this film of any iota of suspense. The premise of Christie's novel is excellent: a series of ""accidents"" in a small village turn out not to be accidents at all, and a pair of would-be lovers risk their lives to expose the insane (and insanely clever) killer. Why the writers decided to make the changes they did is really puzzling to me, and I don't see that any of these changes improve on Christie's story. Benedict Cumberbatch (playing a cop visiting the village from his regular beat in Asia) seeks Miss Marple's advice on the case, when she noses her way into the village after a woman she meets on a train ends up mysteriously dead. In an early role, Russell Tovey plays a local constable, and Shirley Henderson is very good as a local woman who may hold the key to the mystery. Although this outing isn't as boring as ""A Pocket Full of Rye"" or as confusing as ""Why Didn't They Ask Evans?"", it's absolutely awful in the writing and direction.

On the plus side, the films in this set are all beautifully photographed and blessed with large casts of considerable talent that, in the end, can't save the day, even with the help of Miss Marple. One can't help but wonder what's next for these screenwriters. Miss Marple dropping in for tea at 221B Baker Street after Watson is mysteriously poisoned? Miss Marple tagging along with Tom Hanks in the next ""Da Vinci Code"" sequel? Miss Marple stepping in for ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo?"" The screenwriters of these four films should stop trying to fix what isn't broken and appreciate that the Mistress of Crime knew what she was doing when she wrote the original novels.",1527465600,,8156,4.6801393728223

8345291,5,B001UWOLQG,"I love this show.  It has beautiful settings beautifully photographed, interesting stories, interesting characters and fine acting all around.  I love it for the same reasons I love Midsomer Murders.  Being from America, I find the accents, the mannerisms, the surroundings--everything--so quaint and different and overwhelmingly attractive.  I also love Julia McKenzie in this role.  It's difficult to replace an established character, but she has done it marvelously.  I like her every bit as much as Geraldine McEwan, and perhaps even more.  There is something so attractive about her, I find it a pleasure just to look at her.  A kindness, a shyness coupled with a gentle assertiveness--it's perfect for this character.  It makes her able to blend very comfortably into all the scenarios in which she finds herself--always on the periphery, quietly in the background, receiving minimal notice, but taking everything in, shrewdly observing--I love the way she engages in apparent innocent conversation with the other characters, and gently guides the conversation to find out things, or merely gets them to open up and reveal confidences to her.  She makes this seem natural and believable.

This is a purely entertaining series without any overt displays of political correctness which infects so much of everything these days.  I'm too old to be inculcated any more, and find shows attempting to do it totally boring, for it's most often done at the expense of entertainment.  You always feel the agenda beneath the vehicle, and it ruins things for me.  This series, happy to say, has thus far avoided that defect.  It's entertainment for entertainment's sake.

8345295,1,B001UWOLQG,"The ITV productions of Poirot are excellent and largely true to Christie's stories.  But the Marple series, by great contrast, stray far from the original stories and include a number of mysteries in which Miss Marple was not involved.

""Why Didn't They Ask Evans?"" is one of my favourite Christie novels, and this adaptation completely ruins it.  The storyline is completely changed.  The motive is different.  The killers are different.  It's as if the screenwriters involved in Marple have some kind of obsessive disorder that will not allow them to leave the original stories alone.  They change them all.  They make them comically complicated.  Frankly, I'm stunned rigid that the Christie estate allows they to crucify the work of their ancestor like this.  But we must remember that they get paid no matter how bad the adaptations are after all.

The only thing consistent in Why Didn't They Ask Eveans is Bobby and Lady Frances Derwent, who are still wonderful (although I far preferred the 80s version starring Francesca Annis and James Warwick as Frankie and Bobby).  But everyone keeps calling Frankie ""Lady Derwent""!  She is the daughter of Lord Marchington.  Therefore she is Lady Frances, not Lady Derwent.. Derwent is her surname, not her father's;  he is Marchington.  She is an earl's daughter, much like Princess Diana was an earl's daughter and before her marriage to Prince Charles was Lady Diana, NOT Lady Spencer.  In terms of pecking order, the Savages wouldn't have been too impressed with Lady Derwent because she could have been married to a man with a mere knighthood.  Lady Frances, conversely, would have been impressive because she is the daughter of a hereditary peer, a man who sits in the House of Lords..
