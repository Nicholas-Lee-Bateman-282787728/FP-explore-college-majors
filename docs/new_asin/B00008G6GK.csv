1843523,5,B00008G6GK,"His and Her Circumstances is incredibly funny. Though the storytelling is very direct in the beginning, and character development pretty much done in the first few episodes, the whole series was very enjoyable to watch. This isn't a typical love story with all the backstabbing, exaggerated angst you'd find in a series like, say, fushigi yuugi. His And Her Circumstances, is almost an acquired taste since its niether fast paced nor full of plot turns. Some people whine about the whole still pictures with floating text thing, but it works well to give the story a subtle, reflective flavor to it that makes you think.",1077753600,5,620,4.914285714285715
1843524,4,B00008G6GK,"Two kids in high school, one a girl named Yukino Miyazawa who is a hard working student because she loves the praise and attention it gets her, and the other a boy, named Souichirou Arima,who comes along and takes it away from her, by being the perfect boy.  Of course, this pisses her off and that's when the fun starts.
Yukino does all she can to plot her revenge, but what happens when he tells her he loves her?  And what happens when she realizes she might love him too?
The story is somewhat realistic in the plot, there are no aliens or robots here, just love, hate, need and friendships.  The artwork, and music, changes, depending on the inside thoughts of the characters and whose point of view we happen to be watching.  Sometimes it looks like something out of a black and white film and other times it makes Southpark look like a classic!  But it made me laugh and, a couple of times, almost made me cry.  The characters are all flawed, yet sometimes very strong and very real.  While they sometimes get confused, they don't act stupid nor do they just let things get worse while they whine.  They charge ahead and try to change things for the better, even if things sometimes get really messy.
There are lots of recaps and flashbacks.  Also, the reason I dropped a point was because there is no closure.  There better be another anime series in the making, otherwise I'll have get the manga to figure out what happens next!
OK for males and females, so guys, buy it too!",1077580800,42,1484,4.442804428044281
1843525,5,B00008G6GK,"I have to admit, I was pretty scared. I received the first KareKano DVD as a birthday gift and it was one of the coolest animes I've seen to date.  I truly loved it! After that I began my scheme of how should I put this, gathering funds for my rather expensive investment :p. hehe. Eventually I saved enough dough, and bought the rest of it. The part I was ""scared"" about came after that purchase.  You see, I was so looking forward to my DVDs, I decided to snoop around and read the reviews, and whatever, but I was SHOCKED when I read one of the reviews.  I was really frightened at well... how many unpleasant reviews it received. So I was a LOT more anxious, and a LOT more worried. This is my first REAL anime DVD collection, I've seen other anime, but this was the most expensive most definitely NO REGRETS though! Maybe it's because I read those reviews and I was intent on enjoying them that I did, but this series deserves more credit than given :). I have to admit there were certain parts that were rather disappointing. In my opinion there was at the most 2.5 episodes that were a total waste of time and money, but whatever, everything else rocked!
In a lot of the reviews, I noticed that people were unsatisfied with the ""ending"" of KareKano... (yea I'm disappointed too)BUT I guess I'm still happy with it cause I love it so much. I guess I'm just looking at it as... the end of that DVD... and i'm hoping, and praying that they will continue with it (not gonna happen most likely, but one can dream :)). There was that rather odd episode where there really were cut out figures moved along on sticks -_-"" haha, but i found it amusing more than annoying. (Perhaps I'm writing this review in its defense cause I spent a lot of my money on it haha).
The thing I really enjoyed about KareKano is, is that there doesn't seem to be any ""useless"" characters anywhere, they all had their stories to be told, and they were all very touching. It's not only about the love between some teenage couple either, I noticed that there were a lot of themes involving family as well. Something else I saw a little differently was that, although at first they come right out and the characters intentions are revealed, I just found it amusing the way they did it, it was like they were trying to make it funny rather than shove it down anyone's throats. Not all the characters are presented in this manner though, the rest are rather interesting in their own way and revealed in due time.
If you're interested in KareKano then it would probably be wiser to invest in the Manga, there are 13 volumes and it doesn't look like they'll all be released by Tokyopop by the end of this year, however 1-7 are out now and 8 is coming soon! The Anime ends around where vol8. is. If I had more money I would've definitely invested in the manga as well. *saving like crazy* *sigh* There's so very much I want... :)",1077494400,2,2899,4.364814814814815
1843526,1,B00008G6GK,"Every time another Gainax title jumps into the fray, the same thing happens. Lots of hype. And it's no wonder; they start out extremely engaging and innovative. Then, like the doomed train wreck that any Gainax film is, it goes flying off the track and into oblivion.
His And Her Circumstances chronicles the romance between Yukino and Arima, two high school students striving to be the best for all the wrong reasons. The plot starts out sweet and engaging, with lots of humor. It becomes old pretty quickly, however, because of the mind-numbing angst employed. Remember all those random on-screen text inserts in ""Evangelion""? Yep, they're back. With a vegeance. Yukino and Arima love to go off on these unrealistic tangents where they think about how wonderful or terrible everything is. Cue sappy violin music and lots of inner monologue. Repeat until you feel sick to your stomach. Really, Mr. Anno, this wasn't cool in Eva, and it's not cool now. Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou is up there with the greatest disappointments of anime. Do yourself a favor and check out the far more endearing ""Marmalade Boy,"" which has all the ups and downs of a shaky relationship with a far smaller (if still a bit high) angst helping.",1076457600,5,1218,4.832535885167464
1843527,5,B00008G6GK,"I don't want to make this too long, but I do want to get out a few reasons why i wish there was a vhoice to give His and Her Circumstances 4 1/2 stars rather than a full out 5:
1) Recaps: There's plenty of recap, at the start of episodes as well as in a two part recap episode. It's certainly more recap than any other anime I can recall having seen, and it does get a little annoying. Luckily, the fast forward key on my DVD remote worked like a charm, although kost of the time i didn't mind watching recaps and laughing at more than a few sceanes form the past.
2) Ending: I've started anime series before they're finished, ending on a DVD and wishing there was another coming since things weren't resolved. That's exactly how His and her ended. The only difference is that it was supposed to have ended. It really leads you up to a cliff and then just leaves you there. If rumors are true and there is another series comnig to wrap things up, I'd be very happy to hear it.
Now despite those two facts, His and Her was overall one the best, if not THE best, anime series I personally have seen. The secondary AND main charectors were all great, well developed and interesting. The plot went all around, never spending too much time on one thing I think, and the directors did a good job keeping things interesting for me. His and Her is at moments very touching, and at others uproaringly funny. The music is fitting for every sceane, the artwork is wonderful, and the DVD is well put together over all, with very well done dubbing. While there weren't a whole lot of extras, the interview with the actors and the director's commentary were both very interesting to see.
While this series certainly isn't for everyone (with a lack of blood and guts, and a plenty of angst and humor mixed together), it's certainly a recommend for those that love romantic comedy animes.",1075507200,5,1872,4.3976945244956775
1843528,1,B00008G6GK,"I seem to be of a distinct minority opinion about this show. Granted, there are some very good qualities about it-- the artwork (for the most part) is incredible, there's a reasonable amount of character appeal, and one of the later episodes was so good it left me speechless as the credits rolled. But good artwork and occasional flashes of inspiration can't carry a whole show, and when the interminable final episode drunkenly staggered to its close, I thought, ""you couldn't pay me enough to watch that again"". The basic premise is a blossoming romance between two high school students, Yukino and Arima. That's a concept that can turn into a cliche very easily, and the creators seem bent on putting in enough innovation that that won't happen. Their efforts, however, either fall flat, or have the opposite effect of being so badly done they actually worsen the show.
The first thing I noticed when watching this, is that all subtlety is thrown to the wind. Yukino and Arima both have more to them than at first meets the eye. At least, they would if they didn't come right out in the first couple of episodes and explicitly tell us everything about their personalities, and what they're really like (as in, ""my name is Yukino. I like to fool people into thinking I'm a nice, good student, but really, I just like being the best and having everyone's admiration""). It would be nice to slowly learn about the lead characters, as their subtleties and flaws gradually become apparent. Instead, it's violently shoved down our throats in the first three episodes.
I stated earlier that character appeal is a strength of the series. I should clarify: appeal of the secondary characters is a strength of the series, and they don't get nearly enough face time (Arima is bland, and Yukino is bland with an occasional obnoxious flair). The secondary cast is likeable and funny, and they have a surprising amount of depth for the amount of screen time they receive. But too often, the show subjects us to Yukino and Arima endlessly babbling on about how much they love each other. The high point of the series is definitely the two or three episodes when Arima is out of town. That, briefly, gives the secondary characters a chance to shine.
On to the plot: His and Her Circumstances, obviously, has a fairly mundane story, since it tries to be realistic in what it portrays. In a better show, this might result in gripping, subtle psychological drama. That was probably the idea in this series, but what we get instead is a slew of boring romance/ everyday life scenes which either induce yawns or eye rolling. Ex: It's the school sports fest, and everyone is really busy setting up. Yukino wants to spend time with Arima, but what's this? He's so busy, she has trouble finding him! What will she do?! Everyone she asks has seen him somewhere, but no one knows where he's gone! Oh no!! Then, she finds him. (after about half an episode of this)
The fact that the creators seem to really take this seriously would be funny, if it wasn't such a pain to sit through, and if scenes like that weren't quite so common.
Then, there are the recaps. Recap episodes are an unfortunately common convention of anime, and sometimes  they're used as filler, when the creator falls short on ideas and innovation. That was certainly the case here. Most series which sport this convention have just one recap episode. His and Her Circumstances takes it to a whole new level, with one full recap episode and two half recap episodes. What's more, the later recap material is presented in a way such as to make it impossible to follow if you haven't recently seen the episodes. It's clear the director didn't really care about recapping anything. He needed filler, and this handy little time waster presented itself. Toward the end, the episodes become less and less coherent. Some of them inexplicably start off with a  summary of Japan's faltering economic conditions (don't ask me why). Then the animation budget got slashed, resulting briefly in the hilarious use of paper cutouts of the characters filmed against real time backgrounds. The last episodes degenerate into still pictures of the characters, garbled monologues, and random references to earlier events. This does not serve any higher artistic purpose whatsoever, although some might try to tell you otherwise. Believe them at your own risk.
In closing, while His and Her Circumstances isn't an entire flop, it's certainly enough of one to warrant one star. Many of the problems I mentioned earlier are isolated incidents but, along with others like them, they help to form a fatally flawed whole. Yukino and Arima can be summed up by one word: boring. Teen angst in relationships can be very painful but, as this show proves, that doesn't always make it moving, brilliant, or fun to watch.",1075334400,10,4832,4.799519807923169
1843529,5,B00008G6GK,"Never before in anime have I truly enjoyed a series of such depth and fullness conveyed in such short, 15-minute episodes.  Kare Kano (His and Her Circumstances) is a Japanese manga-turned-anime produced by the famous Studio GAINAX of Evangelion fame.  While this series has gained only word-of-mouth popularity in the US, it is a critically acclaimed series in Asia.
STORY: The series is about high school love, the issues relating to maturity into adulthood, and the construction of personal identity.  Focusing on the relationship between two top students in 10th grade (HS freshman in Japan), it honestly portrays the humanity of two teenagers facing their own weaknesses, their troubles, and interpersonal relations, and ultimately their ""true"" identities that they must find and live up to fulfillment.  Kare Kano being a shoujo anime (anime targeted for girls) has nothing to do with the accessibility of the series -- it maintains a perfect balance between serious high school drama and cute anime humor that have appealed to all of my friends who watched it, though from personal experience this series would be better appreciated by people who have watched a couple animes and understand the standard anime conventions -- this series definitely uses some art styles quite liberally and refreshingly.
ART: The art style of the series is very fascinating -- most of the time, it switches back and forth between ""realistic"" and ""cartoony"" deptions of characters, uses pencil-sketch stills to convey gravity in a situation, and uses heavy amounts of text (like a manga) to depict the mood and atmosphere of a situation -- just like reading an animated comic book.  There are certain episodes that take off entirely, however, and use unconventional art styles that bring about a refreshing look -- for example, one episode is nearly entirely done in paper-cut figurines sketched out with pencil, superimposed around shots of real landmarks (school/surroundings in Japan).  Stories narrated by difference characters also have different looks as well, such as the manga-loving sister depicting the protagonists' story in a cute, superdeformed art style or the high-school-friend-who-looks-like-a-cute-elementary-school-kid friend who shares her tale in crayon-drawn sketches.  Lastly, who could forget the last episode, in which most of the anime are manga stills with a narrator voice-over and melodramatic music?  (It works better than it sounds, pun intended.)
MUSIC: I've found the music to be rather pleasing, though on something as subjective as music I suppose YMMV.  Because of the nature of this anime, the background music switches between cute, zany anime songs and serious, pensive piano music.  It borrows primarily from classical/romantic tradition, with songs as The Girl With Flaxen Hair (Debussy) and On the Central Steppes of Asia (Borodin), though it does feature some J-pop as well.  The music does fit the shoujo style well, though.
DISLIKES:  It there were anything to be said against the series it would probably be the immense amount of recaps for every anime and recap episodes -- there's around 1+.5+.5 (.5 as in half the episode was a recap) episodes worth of going through the story line *again*.  In addition, I was amazed at the capacity in which every single episode intro manages to summarize the plotline of all the episodes before, which, by episode 26 (when you're hearing a recap of 1-25), can be somewhat frustrating. But bear with it -- at least the story that's conveyed in the 10-15 short minutes of the actual anime is developed fuller than any other anime episodes in other series.
*NOTE*: Be very aware that the series does not quite provide resolution -- it's not supposed to, since episodes 1-26 only cover the storyline arch of the manga up to manga 8.  Kare Kano has progressed to manga 17 in Japan right now with the Arima arc being resolved -- the story is excellent I might add, though you'll need some Japanese comprehension to understand the manga.  It is rumored that a second DVD series is coming out, though since there has been a falling out between GAINAX and the comic book writer the chances of a second DVD set is becoming slim... :(
CONCLUSION: I've lived through my fair share of academic competition, procrastination, and anime watching, and I have to conclude that this by far one of the better anime series I've seen!  ""Honest"" is the best adjective that comes in describing this coming-of-age story, with ""beautiful"" coming in as a close second.  Don't miss this!",1063065600,5,4532,5.110960757780785
1843530,5,B00008G6GK,"Yukino is a model student in everyone else's eyes.  Straight A, perfect personality, get along with others.  Yet, there's another side of her that's yet to be discovered along with the arival of Arima Souichirou, intelligent, smart, kind, athletic, charismatic... everything that Yukino had pretended to be all her life... who quickly becomes a strong competition, like getting better grade than Yukino without trying.  At first, Yukino sees Souichirou as her opponant, someone she has to beat.  She competes with him on everything, trying to regain the title of ""model student.""  She eventually gets her title back by studying harder and harder.  Things are now going well for Yunkino..However..as time passed, Yukino starts to develop a crush on Souichirou.  The other side of Yukino, the image of a lazy, selfserving average girl is then accidentally revealed to Souichirou when he pays a visit at Yukino's house.  He then starts ""threatening"" her of revealing her secret unless she does homework for him.  Yukino soon discovered that Souichirou is only using her as she gives up her feeling for him and refuses to do his homework ever again.  Surprisingly, Souichirou goes after her and tells her that he has feelings for her, and the whole ""blackmailing"" thing is only an excuse for him to get to know her better.  So they starts going out...and more interesting stuff happens. (i don't wanna spoil more stuff)
His and her circumstances is a definitely a masterpiece, it's not merely a romance, it really draws you into the actual anime.  I didn't think i would like it at first, because i'm usually into Magic/Romance, but this anime is much more.  Let's just say...It gives you like a fuzzy feeling, and you would want to watch it again and again.  It also tells you that to always trust your instincts, even though perfect relationship is vague, if you try, you will be able to find it n-n;;",1059264000,14,1899,4.89375
1843563,1,B00008G6GK,"Normally I would have given His and Her Circumstances a 5 and praised it with much glory, but unfortunatly I cannot do that because of a horrible epidemic that has plagued most anime productions since the birth of the genre.  That plague is poor budgeting/Runious endings.

This anime had the best first half of a series I have ever seen (the first 16 episodes), but during the second half of the episodes Gainax showed their usual hattred and lack of respect towards their fans, and their amazing laziness, by using some of the most disgusting ideas to cut their budget and save money I have ever seen in an anime (a MASSIVE 5-10 minute series recap at the beginning of EVERY episode, prolonged still scenes, cardboard cutouts, black and white manga drawings which is ok for a while, but not for an entire episode, massive sections where japanese words are writen on screen with little to no dialog [which destroys the anime for americans, because large quanities of kenji/hiragana won't be translated fully for us], and an inclusive ending).

Even with all of those problems, if they had finished the anime then I would have endured it and come out happy, but the anime was cut short since the manga was still in production.  When something like that happens, you MAKE UP AN ENDING, or end the series with a good second series cliff hanger.  Again, just like in NGE, Gainax f#$%ed up and gave us the worst ending Ive ever experienced in an anime to date (worse then X: the movie, the original NGE ending, and some of the other sub-par anime endings Ive experienced).  I have totally lost any faigh in Gainax and have personally boycotted ever buying a product touched by them.

All in all, His and Her Circumstance will throughly piss you off and anger you if you watch it from beginning to end, and I have yet to find anyone who would watch part of a movie or series and stop when they could continue, no matter how rough the going is.  The ending of this series will truly turn you off of this anime, when an ending should leave you satisfied.  I refuse to give any product, no matter how great its beginning was, a good score if it ends piss poor and incomplete.  Thanks alot once again Gainax.",1156464000,9,2199,4.544303797468355

1843568,5,B00008G6GK,"GAINAX, the most famous for its blasphemus and brilliant Evangelion, took on Kare Kano by Masami Tsuda.  Push aside all the philosophical and cryptic and garbage.  this anime is a careful analysis of two individuals who never opened themselves up to others before.  Yukino and Arima are learning to understand each other and also themselves through their relationship.  This relationship is so throughly developed and carefuly analyzed, I can't say anything bad about it.  this anime is probably the most insightful anime I've ever watched.  Along with that central theme, add hillarious comedy, good romance storyline, incredible seiyuu work which I think is among the best in any anime, and some truly brilliant character development, you've got a great anime series truly worth watching.

It is true that the anime start out great and towards the end it start to fall apart a little.  Especially at the end if you were looking for a conclusion you won't get one.  Of course it would've been nice to have a solid conclusion and great second half, this anime is still too good to be put down because of it.  and beside I thought the ending was really realistic many ways.  I mean many people, including myself, are used to seeing a conclusive hollywood productions everyday.  The truth is, however, what happens in this anime is much more real and is much more complex.

If there is one realy true negative, it is its animation towards the end.  Apparently GAINAX must have ran out of money or something because the last episode especially look like flipping manga pages rather than watching an anime.  Character designs and background animation all begin to lose its texture towards the end which is disappointing.

I've watched anime for a long time and this anime still is among my favorite.  If you want a change of pace from fanservice dominated romance animes, or one of those cheesy day time drama romance animes, I say this anime will give you a fresh presentation of realism in relationships.",1144540800,3,2002,4.875739644970414
1843569,4,B00008G6GK,"I personally found this series touching and inspiring. It's strange because a series usually has to have some shounen-ai to make any impact on me. Those series seems to have quite a few bad reviews but I'm here to stick up for it. It isn't my favorite anime by far, but worth buying (at a cheaper price than the amazon price though).

The relationship between Arima and Yukino is slow but well developed and though I didn't like the side characters at first, as you get to know each of their stories the series becomes even more ejoyable.

For those of you who have read the manga, I find the anime adaptation actually better. The manga is slow paced and has a lot of scenes which are just thoughts and feelings. The anime forces some of the uselessness out of scenes and at the same time keeps the slow paced (worth while)content. Not just that, but the anime is set out very much like the manga, favoring pictures rather than animation.

Overall, and enjoyable series that shouldn't have such a sour reputation.",1137283200,2,1013,4.554945054945055
1843570,3,B00008G6GK,"Kare Kano started off REALLY strong. The independence and clearly defined personalities of the two main characters (Yukino Miyazawa and Soichiro Arima) instantly drew me into the series. I found the situations, reactions and thoughts between Arima and Yukino very real and relatable. Not only were they funny, but they were also very emotional and sincere.

However, Yukino and Soichiro were the only people that made the series worth watching. I found the other characters within the series to either be boring or just extremely annoying, (with the exception of Arima's best friend, who was hilarious and maybe Miyazawa's parents, who were also very funny and cute in their appearances).

The supporting cast was weak and not nearly as well defined and strong as the two main characters. The episodes that featured them bored me and I just didn't care about them or their situations. One character in particular has a series of very serious episodes, and then completely drops off from the rest of the show. Whenever there were scenes featuring members of the supporting cast, I found myself wanting to fast forward to the scenes with the main couple. Miyazawa and Arima shouldn't have to carry the story all by themselves.

The ending of this series also disappointed me greatly, or, the lack of an ending. The way the series ends, it feels like there is another episode coming. I was looking through the DVD options, thinking I missed something, perhaps a ""bonus episode"" hidden somewhere? I started to get worried about the how the series would end when episode 25 had absolutely nothing to do with anything that had taken place in the series so far. I was SO sure that episode 25 would start the nice ""wrap-up"" of the series. The final episode (26) also has a lot of text that pops up and leaves the screen relatively quickly. I had to rewind the DVD maybe 20 times to catch and read everything. But in the end, everything is left very open and ambiguous. Not only are characters situations left unresolved, we're not even told if a particular event is a success or failure.

Despite my three paragraphs of griping, I would actually recommend buying this anime. The relationship between Arima and Miyazawa is dynamic enough to deal with all the other downfalls of the series. Buy it, but don't pay over $40 for it. ^_^",1132790400,7,2323,4.8
1843571,3,B00008G6GK,"Since that anime wasn't released in my home country (Germany) when I wanted it, I ordered this U.S. box.

I knew the anime before already from fansubs, since I liked it a lot I wanted the real DVDs when they got released.

About the anime itself. It's a sweet story about romance and the maturation of different teenagers facing their true self. Sounds serious now, but it isn't at all. It's an anime full of SD (super deformed) and humour. In some degree rather silly one. Now it sounds like a comedy romance. Well it is, but it also isn't. This piece coming from the same studio and director as Neon Genesis Evangelion, makes one already suspect that there's more to it than a shallow love-love story. If you take out the SD and silly humour you actually have a story that could be written by real life. That's even rare in the romance anime world.

GAINAX messed up the animations in some later episodes. Appears experimental and personally I didn't like it at all. Also the story finds no end in the anime but closes with a `to be continued' line. There's no sequel out yet (but there's enough stuff out to make two sequels).

So those two points (the partly fked up animations, the totally open end) I count to the flaws of it. Also the flashbacks and brief summaries become annoying after some episodes.

The story gets continued in the manga of course. The manga is also worth to read. Personally I wouldn't say that you should read the manga and not watch the anime. That manga is by far not as funny as the anime and didn't touch the emotions the anime did.

I'll now get to the important part of this review, the reason why I actually wanted to write one.

The U.S. Versions of Kare Kano (which is its original name coming from Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou) are cut! When I'd tell you where now I'd have to spoiler (at the moment I can still remember a love-love scene that was missing in the U.S. releases). I was so disappointed.

Beside that the animations itself seem not to be improved. Even the fansubs had better quality when it comes down to HSV (hue, saturation, value) and contrast.

Sometimes the images appear too dark, next time too light.

Good was the on-screen text subtitlestream. Since that anime has a lot of on-screen text I was wondering how a professional firm would solve that. And it pleased me.

Also the plenty of extra stuff on the DVDs was nice and I liked the design of the box itself.

The anime itself gets 4 starts from me. That rating got reduced by one star because that anime got cut, boo-boo!

I am very disappointed of the DVD because more than half of it is made up of ""Play Backs"" and ""Previews."" DVDs 1 to 3 were okay but come DVD 4 and 5, I guess the creators got pretty lazy so they cut out some Yukino and Arima drawings and made some puppets out of it... some parts, also as bad, is when they just pasted pictures from the Manga version, added some background music and some narration. What was that? So I guess 1 Star for every ""good"" DVD would suffice... The manga version is so good so to make sure that you get the most out of Kare Kano (and make sure you catch the best of it!), read the Manga FIRST and then MAYBE you can watch the DVD...",1130544000,4,745,3.9078947368421053

And actually I don't know why it has that many average reviews, it's really an excelent series! It's quite fun and inspiring. I must say I have personal reasons to love this anime, mainly because it can describe most of your own lifetime at that period, you may even recall some characters to people you actually met! Or even if not, it's really fun to watch, viewing from different perspectives; Ok this is Yukino's and Arima's story, but that doesn't mean we can't know about the other characters of the story in a deeper way. Finally if you want to know what happens after the 26th episode buy the manga/comic (starting from volume 8) is as great as the series, a must have, both of them!",1129334400,3,788,4.5174825174825175
1843584,1,B00008G6GK,"I got this show before seeing any of the episodes, but I thought it was a good bet at the time. After all, everything gets a few token bad reviews, so I wasn't all that worried. Yawning through the tenth straight nonsensical series recap, I had to admit my error. Honestly though, the recaps are the least of the problems. Look, it isn't that I mind whiny teenage angst over relationships-- we've all been there, so I can't complain too much. The problem is that it seems like the creators are taking this really seriously, like they think its the ultimat expression of the human condition. When that happens their ability to skillfully handle the subject matter breaks down, and they just come off looking ridiculous. And am I the only one who thinks its just a little bit disturbing at the beginning when Arima is manipulating and using the girl to do his work for him, and all the while she keeps fawning over him and thinking how he's so wonderful and perfect, and she'll never be worthy of him? Creepy stuff, not that the creators seemed to recognize that.

So stay away from this show. It's surreal and weird, and not in a good way. It's only ""first love,"" as another reviewer puts it, in that first love can be emotionally draining, manipulative, pretentious, cliquish, and not really loving at all.",1122508800,5,1306,4.605150214592275
1843585,4,B00008G6GK,"I decided to give this series a try after I saw ""Niea under 7"". I really liked Niea and I was interested in trying some other Anime comedies (Amazon reccomended this).

There is alot to like about ""His and Her Circumstances"". The music is fantastic, the characters are interesting & likeable, and the comedy is funny. The animation is a bit rough (compared to Niea) but it was still very good.

The few flaws: First, the plot was too predictable at times. Far too many times the plot surrounds the introduction of a new evil character, who later becomes good and joins Yukino and Arimas cool group of friends. Second, the synopsis of the previous episodes. Oh my god, how annoying it is to review the entire series before every new episode. Third, the ending. What some might interpret as creative and abstract, I found lazy and annoying.

Still for all it's flaws, I was still impressed with this cartoon.  I reccomend this title to fans of anime comedy.

1843586,1,B00008G6GK,"I don't have really high standards for the anime I watch, but this show crosses all the boundaries. I was expecting a lively, smart romantic comedy, but this show feels more like the dramatization of some thirteen year old kid's diary. It's about one third boring everyday stuff, one third whiny, sniveling inner monologues, and one third recap stuff, which is mostly just a transparent excuse for more inner monologues. Since the recaps are usually cumulative for the whole show, they just get longer and longer. Also, as the relationship progresses, the main characters get more and more obnoxious and arrogant, especially the girl. Why is everyone so amazed by this show? People should take some more time to think this over, rather than just jumping on the bandwagon and proclaiming the greatness of what is, at it's heart, a mediocre, half-hearted series.",1116633600,9,860,5.020979020979021
1843587,3,B00008G6GK,"The beginning was absolutely wonderful. It was about two highschool students falling in love. But after they became a couple the story started wondering all over the place. They made several episodes about secondary characters whose relationships have no connection to the two main characters, why? They should have made a whole different series about that. There are too many recaps and stillness that destroyed the series at the end. I loved the first half, and was very disappointed with the end.",1115251200,4,499,5.097560975609756
1843588,2,B00008G6GK,"When I first started watching His and Her (or kare kano), I was really excited.  I wasn't expecting an earth-shattering, question-your-motives-on-life type of anime, but rather a simple love story.  What I ended up getting was kind of a poor conglomeration of the two.  They start by developing the two main characters thoroughly, but then, after the two main characters get together and begin to build their relationship, the series begins to feel fake and fall apart.  Yes, they did try to represent some of the deeper aspects of relationship, and kudos for that, but there was so much else bad about the series that it is not worth a second watch.  First, and most annoyingly, there are recaps in virtually EVERY SINGLE episode that take up a good portion of the time in each episode.  This is ""cute"" at first, but gets really boring after a while, after you realise you can recite the whole thing by heart, probably in the original Japanese.  And, for all you fans of recapping-so-you-don't-have-to-develop-anything, there is an ENTIRE ADDITIONAL EPISODE for your perusing satisfaction.  Watch it and skip the first 13 or so.  After the recap extravaganza, the whole series began to crumble.  They made several attempts to introduce new characters and perspectives, and failed miserably on the follow-through, creating a bunch of halfway done story lines and too many loose ends towards the end to make this an enjoyable series.  Rent or borrow this one.  This is just another example of an anime that started out great and with a lot of promise, then fizzled and died long before it ended.",1109980800,5,1594,4.884758364312268
1843589,5,B00008G6GK,"This is a great anime.  Lots of ppl are complaining about the end. . . thats because the choices for ending an anime are either (1) Close it with a happy ending that you probably anticipated about 4 episodes from the end. (2) Close it with a sad ending that you hoped might not happen but kinda anticipated. or (3) Leave it open, not for future episodes but for the best thing ever - human imagination.  Yeah, I know it bites when that happens and you feel empty inside because its over for ever and yet it never ends because it didn't have one. . but thats the point, so you keep thinking and feeling the story over and over again.",1100131200,3,632,4.214876033057851
1843590,4,B00008G6GK,"His and Her Circumstances is an absolutely amazing series...yet the addictive storyline only leads up to an emtpy wasted shell of an ending. I do highly recomend this anime. It truly is one of the best of all time. The artwork and character development exceed most anime. However the characters are so likeable that they leave you hungering in the end for more information. Especially Arima....This character specifically captures my sympathy and attention. I feel the director and producers should have elaborated more on the story. Hopefully there will be a sequel series of some sort...so the cliffhanger will be met with a resolution. I feel like the directors worked hard but the at the end just got completely lazy and showed bits and peices of the manga in order to create the last episode. The story was wonderful, but the animation for the plot was at times annoying. I did not enjoy the episode done entirely in crayon or the vast amount of flashbacks and recaps in the other episodes. The series even dedicated an entire episode and a half on recaps. I feel as though that is a huge waste. After a while you get sick of hearing the exact same information again and again. I recomend this series for a person who enjoys romance but doesn't mind loose ends and repetition.",1090627200,9,1281,4.723214285714286
1843591,2,B00008G6GK,"The story and plot of ""His and Her Circumstances"" are excellent no doubt, but the anime had ruined everything. There are too much recaps and stillness in this anime that makes you wonder if the director gave any effort in it at all...
When I first watch the series I thought it was great and was excited to watch on. I didn't really expect it to go bad so fast.
First: There are recaps in practically every episodes. What is worse, as if we hadn't had enough, is that they didicate another episode and a half on recaps. No wonder they can't finish the ending and left us cliff hanging, is because they practically base it on RECRAPS...
Second: The series hold too much stillness in it. Most of the time they have the characters ""PAUSED"" while just their lips moving; or showing them in manga forms without much effort of movements. WHY NOT JUST READ THE MANGAS INSTEAD...
Third: The anime also base on sceneries too much. Who the heck want to see sceneries than their favorite characters...
Forth: Again, the story and plot are excellent but how the director developed the series, well, feels FAKE. I bet the manga feels more real than the series...
It could've been excellent; no thanks to the director. I do recommend you try this anime, but probably in manga books than in series...",1090195200,5,1285,4.567099567099567

It had a good storyline (2 overachievers fall in love with each other after discovering the other was a fake), it was really funny, the animation rocked, and I actually liked all of the main chracters.

7982725,5,B00008G6GK,"Having read through some of the reviews from over a decade ago, it seems a fresh review is in order.

For an anime that released state-side 15 years ago, the timelessness of the struggles of youth, coming of age, and everything associated with one's high school years stands out today more than anything. Back when I first watched the anime, I was inspired by that fact that the human condition is not only addressed, but also shown in the reactions of the characters. Even with the high school setting, the depth that the anime reaches at times can really connect to the view, even now as I have watched this 12 years removed from my high school days.

Speaking of that separation in time, the anime is so good that as I watched it, not only did I see the situations as they were compared to how I perceived them as a youth, but also connected the various interjections made by the adults portrayed in the anime as well.

As to the common denominator in the prior reviews made about the lack of budget leading to less of an anime after the episode ""Progress"", yes, they are a big detraction from the quality of the anime, with one exception: the last episode. For as long as I've watched this, the ending was clearly designed to be a segue to the rest of the manga it was adapting while also sharing a direct message. It may seem a little grating, but the narration spells out the purpose of the anime: the circumstances of its characters. Shiro Sagisu's orchestrated version of ""Stranger in Paradise"" is most fitting for the note the episode ends on (not about to spoil it for those who don't know), and as a backing to Anno's intended message behind his segue back to the manga: we've only seen a certain set of circumstances; there will always be stories and circumstances everywhere, including our own.",1499212800,,1807,4.53680981595092

It's like a race car blowing a tire on the last lap of a race just b4 winning. I really want to love this series but it ends really lousily. Any more than 3 stars is misleading.

But towards the end, the writers dropped the major plot and went with a completely different subplot, and I was like, ""What the heck?  What's going to happen in the main plot?""  and then before I knew it, it was the last episode, and they concluded it in one of the worst ways possible.  Do I regret buying and watching the anime?

7982733,3,B00008G6GK,"I am in complete agreement with K. Garcia on this one.  I first saw Kare Kano six or seven years ago just shortly after it had come out, and it absolutely blew my mind.  The show had an incredible depth, sensitivity, and sense of humor that goes far beyond the traditional shoujo high school romance.  I finally got the chance to buy the boxed set a month or so ago and realized that, far from being some passing fling from my adolescence, the show continued to be relevant and sophisticated even after all these years.  Unfortunately, the show's early promise is not borne out.  By the third volume it is already showing signs of flagging, with two episodes almost completely dedicated to recapping the rest of the series, and things only continue to go downhill from there.  By the fourth volume it shows fewer and fewer signs of sophistication and more and more signs of being just an average shoujo drama.  Because of the show's early promise, this is very painful to watch.  By the fifth volume Kare Kano degenerates into a lackluster, insipid has-been that remains interesting only because of the characters that the show has spent so much time developing, but towards the end of the series even this virtue vanishes. By the 25th episode the animator was apparently fired or changed, as the characters suddenly look like shallow 80s-style renditions of themselves. The 26th episode is almost entirely still manga shots with minimal voice acting and an irritatingly pompous narration.

Having read K. Garcia's review before purchasing the DVD box set, I had passed off the poor evaluation of the last two DVDs as the complaints of someone not sophisticated enough to understand the deep symbolism and human dilemmas that mark the show's early episodes, but Garcia couldn't have been more correct: the last two DVDs are just bad, plain and simple.  I would still recommend the first part of this series to just about anyone, but buyer beware the last two.  I almost prefer to pretend they don't exist just because they dragged such a great series into the mud.",1187222400,,2064,4.80225988700565
7982734,3,B00008G6GK,"Initially, I loved Kare Kano. The characters and their relationships are endearing, the music is catchy, and it continuously left me wondering what would happen next. Then it abruptly stopped, only completing what I estimate to be a third of the full story.

What others have said in reviews about Gainax's bugdet cutting is 100% true. The most annoying thing is that there is way too much recap. At one point, an entire episode and then another half of the next episode are nothing but recap, and recap that has already been presented continuously before. It left me feeling nothing but annoyance.

If you want to experience Kare Kano (His and Her Circumstances), buy the manga. There are 20 volumes, all of which can be purchased on [...], and the story is both well done and complete. If you aren't concerned about spending money on the manga as well as the anime, buy the anime, for it is still enjoyable until it suddenly ends. But do not buy the anime instead of the manga; you will just miss out.",1160352000,,1003,4.597765363128492
