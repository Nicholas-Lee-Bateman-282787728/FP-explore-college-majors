7889785,5,6305467021,"Once again Bandai delivers the goods with their latest Gundam DVD release. Excellent subtitling, crisp and rich picture quality that doesn't suffer from poor compression/artifacts and a nice looking DVD cover...Why doesn't everyone release their anime with this level of excellence? Who knows...
This OVA(Original Video Animation) fits in between the original MS Gundam(0079-0080) and Z Gundam(0087) series. It was one of the first series in the Gundam universe to not involve New types and focus on the grunt eye view of MS battle. The story is hard military space opera...young soldiers caught in the aftermath of the 1 year war are forced to grow up fast while the world around them falls apart and all their illusions of duty and glory are shattered.
The animation is excellent. With rich colors, reminiscent of many Toei productions in the early/mid 80's, and highly detailed robots screaming through space...many consider 0083 to be the best animated Gundam of all time....
I would recommend all the discs of this series. This is the kind of work that has attracted me to anime as far back as the 70s.
About the only thing I could ask for would be slightly nicer menus. They are pretty generic...but that's really my only ""gripe"".",1026086400,,1236,4.975845410628019
7889786,4,6305467021,"Overall this volume does not contain a lot action but more character  development. Kou takes out the Gundam for space battle before it is ready  and ends up totaling it. Afterwards he is emotionally crushed at what he  has done and wanders around in a city on the moon searching for a way to  deal with his failure. He meets a retired Zeon officer who teaches him to  be strong and to be a warrior. He regains his confidence and pilots the  repaired Gundam once again. In this volume there is also a development of a  ""relationship"" between Kou and Nina.",965520000,,554,4.425742574257426
7889787,5,6305467021,"0083 vol 2 has an amazing blend of comodey, story, romance, and great mecha action. The dubbing is great, contrary to some peoples opinions. Buy it, and the rest of the 0083 series. You cant go wrong with em :)",964051200,,210,4.275
