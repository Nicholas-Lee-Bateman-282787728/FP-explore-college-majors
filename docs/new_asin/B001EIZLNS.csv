8298314,2,B001EIZLNS,"No doubt Zbukvic is a fantastic artist and watercolorists. While it is lovely to watch him paint, he provides virtually NO INSTRUCTION; nothing on composition, palette, capturing light and dark, wet-in-wet techniques etc.. Considering the price of this instructional video, I was quite disappointed. It should not be sold as a ""how to"" video, but a tour of 6-7 paintings. Don't buy this if you are looking for instructions",1513468800,2,422,5.130434782608695

8298319,5,B001EIZLNS,Of course the painter is recognized as true master.  It is not hard to absolutely love his paintings.  His DVD is clear and  his subjects are  understandable and not all that common to viewers from the USA.  I don't think there is any demo painting that wasn't about as good as it gets as far as subject.  I do wish he had more to say on the nuts and bolts of painting but his actions are mostly clear and easy to follow even if he doesn't explain every stroke and he certainly leaves something out as it refers to colors he uses in the  yellow house especially the rich looking blue he puts  in the trees nearby.  Didn't get that one at all.  But all in all I do recommend this DVD...but not for beginners.,1404777600,12,707,4.17037037037037
8298320,5,B001EIZLNS,Very informative video on the techniques of plein air watercolor painting. I had never heard of this artist but took a chance based on previous reviews and the astronomical price of his out of print books. Glad I did. Would recommend him to any intermediate to advanced plein air painters.,1370822400,13,289,4.8
8298321,5,B001EIZLNS,I got this as a gift for my father who paints watercolor. He really enjoyed it and has shared it with some of his artist friends. I received the item on time and in good condition. I'm really pleased with how much my dad enjoyed it.,1361664000,7,232,4.065217391304348
