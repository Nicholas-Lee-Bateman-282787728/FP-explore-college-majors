8573396,4,B00BSV1XLA,"It seems the biopic character du jour is Alfred Hitchcock: almost simultaneously released as this film was another real dud called THE GIRL dealing with the making of THE BIRDS which came and went quickly. Now we explore the great suspense maker through the machinations of the making of PSYCHO as the reason for exploring the strange body and mental habitus of Hitchcock. While not all of the data gathered for this film written by John J. McLaughlin based on Stephen Rebello's book `Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho' which in turn was based on the derring-do of filming Joseph Stefano's screenplay adapted from the Robert Bloch book PSYCHO which happened to be `inspired' by the serial killer Ed Gein, there certainly is a potpourri of ideas on which to let a cast a sterling actors dabble.

The setting is 1959 and Hitchcock (Anthony Hopkins, flab enhanced) and his wife, Alma (Helen Mirren) are at the top of their creative game as filmmakers despite the fact that the various studios are suggesting that Hitchcock should retire. But Hitchcock has another film in his head - PSYCHO - and despite the fact that everyone including Alma believes the film cannot be made with the current censorship and because the story is tasteless Hitchcock decides to bankroll his own film and proceed. All of Hitchcock's characteristics surface - his propensity for blond actresses (he even spies on them while they are dressing), his involvement with the lurid story of Psycho to the point of visualizing Ed Gein (Michael Wincott) to bolster his rabid love of the story, his misplaced mistrust of Alma's friendship with writer Whitfield Cook (Danny Huston), and his demand that the entire cast and crew of the closed set film are sworn to silence about the movie's content. Hitchcock engages blond curvaceous Janet Leigh (Scarlett Johansson) and Anthony Perkins (James D'Arcy) for the leads, includes Vera Miles  (Jessica Biel) for a bit part, and constantly fights for the film to be completed and released  - which as we know, happened - due in large part to Hitchcock's own shenanigans about marketing.

Though the real theme of the film is a love story between Hitchcock and Alma, the entire crew at Paramount Pictures becomes involved: Hitchcock's secretary Peggy Robertson (Toni Collette), Lew Wasserman (Michael Stuhlberg), Barney Balaban (Richard Portnow), Saul Bass (Wallace Langham), composer Bernard Hermann (Paul Schackman), writer Joseph Stefano (Ralph Macchio), among others.  Hopkins gives us a fascinating portrait of Hitchcock and the rest of the cast fill their parts well. But in the end we are left wondering which film will be the basis of the next probable biopic of Alfred Hitchcock.  Sacha Gervasi directs with some very generous asides to Hitchcock's mannerisms we all know well.  Grady Harp, March 13",1363305600,4,2824,5.060215053763441
