7736230,4,B01EIW2REC,"Robotics;Notes is a different kind of anime  its got giant robots, but they are virtual reality based. It has artificial intelligences. It has mysteries and danger. It has teen teen angst. It also has one of the most perverse hacker archetypes to be seen in an anime to date. While I enjoyed the rich plot, some of the twists and turns were fairly obvious. Outside of this, this anime proved to be a very enjoyable watch. A word of warning  this anime is in no rush. The plot and the transitions are slow and deliberate. If you need instant gratification, then look elsewhere. If you want a good show, then start streaming or purchase it on BD.",1476057600,2,644,4.495726495726496
7736231,4,B01EIW2REC,"It's fun for the price, but ends up trying to be way too epic for its own good. It's a show you'll watch once and forget about most of it forever.",1473724800,,146,3.7419354838709675
7736232,5,B01EIW2REC,This anime was pretty good. I enjoyed it. Both artwork  and story was good. I am glad the girl sister came back. I first saw it on dvd. Then I saw that Blu ray and Dvd combo. I got rid of the Dvd and got the combo.,1468886400,,214,3.5531914893617023

So why am I writing about Steins;Gate in a review of Robotics;Notes?  Because as the similar example of improper semicolon use should have suggested, these are the work of the same creators.  However, while Steins;Gate is truly great, its successor Robotics;Notes is merely good.

The problem here is the opposite of that displayed in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chaos-Head/dp/B00OLIIMM0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chaos;Head</a>&nbsp;-- by the time the story gets to that of Robotics;Notes (this apparently involves some failure to return to the original timeline in Steins;Gate), the concept is starting to drag everything down.  Only Nae Tennoji, the now 20-year-old daughter of Yugo Tennoji, actually shows up in the anime, but things and characters from previous games and videos show up on an ever increasing list that cryptically affect the final plot, resulting in a number of WTF incidents, most of which are played as red herrings.  The result?  While Steins;Gate climaxes with a final leap to break out of the future controlled by SERN, Robotics;Notes climaxes with an attempt by our heroes and the citizens of their small island to take out a single rogue scientist.  It does not really feel finished because the concept cannot be finished, and this shows.

Too bad.  Per their reputation this series contains one of the most realistic examinations of giant robots ever undertaken by a Japanese animated series, but even there the result goes against them because while time travel is as dangerous as ever in Steins;Gate, giant robots just don't add up to much in Robotics;Notes.",1468627200,4,2139,6.319587628865979
