4503499,4,B004YTKRBA,"At first, I wasn't quite sure but as I got well into the dance lesson, I liked this video alot.  Most of the video in the beginning is a ""learning"" video of the classical Bollywood moves.  I am interested in these but only as they apply to a dance move or a dance routine.  This would be great for someone who has a serious interest in learning the foot steps and hand movements.  I found this of particular enjoyment when the actual dance steps began and the routine started to take form.  She takes it nice and slow with alot of repeat so you have opportunity to really get it.  I loved the final dance routine and often use the routine or part of the steps when I listen to the ""BHANGRA BEATZ"" music cd from Amazon.  I found this video has alot to offer.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bhangra-Beatz/dp/B00004WHRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bhangra Beatz</a>",1319068800,,899,4.993288590604027
4503500,4,B004YTKRBA,Her video is great in giving clear and easy to understand instruction. I have bollywood dance experience and I think it's a good video to pick up new combinations to build your own choreography. It may be more challenging for beginners and novists. Still enjoyable for all.,1318204800,,273,4.829787234042553
4503501,5,B004YTKRBA,"I have seen this DVD from start to finish and feel like I understand Bollywood better now.  I have tried several DVD's from other instructors but finally feel more confident with Bollywood dancing after watching Jaya.  I look forward to more DVD's and I also would love to take fitness with Jaya.  This DVD was good because Jaya brakes down moves that I feel are authentic to Bollywood, she teaches a Dance that I can do at home, for my freinds, for a wedding or teach in my Dance class.  I loves the segment that I can dance along with and I did feel a little workout after it.  I know this is not a fitness DVD but it is the start to becoming a great Bollywood Dancer and Fitness Instructor!  Thank you Jaya, I will keep this DVD in my favorites.  Can't wait for all the DVD's to come.  Last thought, thank you for the breathtaking meditation.  I feel happier and healthier inside and out.",1308787200,,891,4.319277108433735
4503502,5,B004YTKRBA,"Jaya Vaswani presents a great introduction and a wonderful cultural experience in Bollywood Dance. Bollywood is a glamorous art form that is also ""a fusion of genres of many dance styles from around the world, its basic roots from classical Indian dance styles."" It is a language spoken in body gestures.
 I was fortunate to attend the BDSS Bombay Bollywood Show last year and loved it! From this program I have learned so much that is fascinating about bollywood that I previously thought would be too difficult to learn.

This program has ten sections and a running time of 1 hour and 45 minutes.

Jaya is a lovely, cheerful and energetic instructor who quickly draws in your interest and in such a simple way. Her program is designed for all levels and it is high energy, very lively and is simply enjoyable. Sooner than expected, you will be dancing! From a basic step to variations, there you are learning a routine while adding simple traveling steps.

This is a brief outline of the program:

To begin: Namascar-  a short ritual in classical style of Indian dance of thanksgiving and to ask mother earth for permission to stomp on her ground.

Hand mudras or hand gestures: From this section learn a few of the fascinating hand movement popular in bollywood. Some mudras that are safe to use; prayer hands, temple hands, fan hands,etc. Jaya explains that there are many styles of hand mudras which are considered sacred as they were used for devotional purpose.

Warm up: seated leg extensions, head and neck gentle exercises that incorporate the eye movement and head slides popular in bollywood. I have to say the eye movement for me will take some getting used to, I was beginning to swoon....lol! Next-up on your feet for a short section of lunges with arm and hand gestures, and calf, quad stretches.

Basic steps and variations: begin with hip articulation and adding the popular ""bounce"" in the hip movement; circles, and step touch, and hop footwork pattern along with more variations.

 Combination section : Lots of fun! Here is a ""basic handbook"" with a multiple array of hand and foot gestures that speak a language about eyes, eyeliner, bindhi, bangles, anklets, earrings, and a woman's shirt, choli, and so much more.

The performance of routine and full choreography section: Incorporates different styles of Indian dance to form a simple, delightful routine. Some of the movement is taught as you go along, with brief break down of movement. Great teaching method with ample repetitions!

Dance along section: Jaya leaves you with a generous helping of advanced moves for future use. These are high paced routines, if you're lucky enough to have an adjustable speed for playback on your equipment, slowing this down will enable you to view and learn the routine with much ease.

To finalize: a brief seated meditation. A very, very lovely program!",1308441600,25,2870,4.8907216494845365
4503503,5,B004YTKRBA,"I love this dvd!  After my Bollywood dance instructor moved out of state several years ago, I was looking for a dvd that would take up the slack.  Bollywood Dance for Beginners was perfect for that. The choreography was fun and lively, with that delightful joyfulness that Bollywood dance tends to have.

The instruction on how to do the movements was explained well. It was also helpful that as you work your way through the choreography instruction, there are parts where you practice to the music that repeat three times in a row.  That really aids in sinking the movement into your muscle memory better.

What I particularly liked about the dvd was that Jaya has a section of keyword movements that not only help you understand the meaning of the movements, it gives you a movement vocabulary to use if you want to put together your own choreography. It's great to see a beginner's instructional dvd that gives the viewer the tools and encouragement to explore the dance form on their own.

Thank you Jaya Vaswani and World Dance New York for coming out with such a great dvd. I could not be happier with it.",1308009600,31,1112,4.619289340101523
4503504,4,B004YTKRBA,"Have you ever watched a Bollywood movie and wondered what the hand gestures, eye and head movements mean?  If the answer is yes, then this dvd is for you.  It is an instructional and dance workout that gives you the tools to watch bollywood dance with new eyes.  It's not a Hemalayaa bollywood dance dvd; so don't expect nonstop movement .  It's not a Sarina Jain dvd, so don't expect a sweat drenching workout. What you will get is very precise instruction with slow explanations and lots of repetition. Also, this isn't pure bollywood, but is a mixture of classical Indian dance , Bollywood and Bhangra dance.

The hand mudras:
Jaya teaches the Sanskrit and English names for the hand and face gestures.  This is very instructional and informative for people who are interested in Classical Indian dance.
Bollywood basic steps:
Jaya combines the mudras with foot patterns and explanations.  It was very interesting to see that the movements tell a story or express an emotion.
The workout:
Jaya teaches a full routine that takes about 3 minutes to complete.  She takes you through the routine in sections.  She slowly teaches a section and then the section is repeated up to tempo 3 times with music.  Each section is added on to the previous section when played up to tempo with music, 3x.  At the end the entire routine is played 3x.  This in itself is a workout.  This is followed by 2 dance along routines without instruction.  They are quite easy to follow.
The experience:
While I enjoyed learning the hand mudras , the classical dance movements, and the routine, after you learn them, then this dvd is no longer useful as a workout.  I say that because the workout detailed instruction is part of the workout.  It should have been a separate chapter. Also she goes over the dance routine steps too many times.  I would classify this dvd as more of an instructional dvd than a workout dvd.  On the plus side,if you've always wanted to know the intricacies of Classical Indian dance than this is the dvd for you. If Sarina Jain's dvds are too much for you and you need to move at a slower pace, then this dvd is for you.  As for me I prefer Bhangra dance.  I like to feel like I'm at a Northern Indian wedding reception dancing up a storm.  This dvd didn't do that for me.",1308009600,13,2279,4.5503685503685505
4503505,5,B004YTKRBA,"Beautiful Jaya Vaswani brings us part of her world, the energetic dance form based on classical Indian movements as well other forms of dance, known to us mainly by seeing the incredibly entertaining Bollywood movies. Jaya has gorgeous hands, and shows us many of the arm and hand positions that have meanings and are so expressive. Indian dancing has such exquisite femininity, and Jaya is great at teaching us to emulate its gracefulness.

After an initial blessing, and a wonderful  stretchy warm-up, you'll learn the basic steps, and then learn a section by section dance routine. This DVD is for ""Beginners,"" but would be applicable for those starting out in dance in general, or those starting out in Bollywood style dance in particular. You'll need agility and also to be a high-energy person to succeed in this style, but anything you can do at any level will be beneficial, if you want a good and diverse exercise program!

The 2 ""Dance Along"" pieces are a blast, and are fun to do once you know the basics. You just follow Jaya as much as you can, and it's a fantastic aerobic workout. No lethargic folks need apply! The final meditation is an incredibly relaxing mental journey, and a marvelous way to end this fun and lively DVD. Music includes pieces by Vibal Beats, and production and cinematography is the usual high standard we know and love from World Dance New York.",1306713600,13,1384,4.758333333333334
4503526,4,B004YTKRBA,"It was really fun to try something new! I thought that in some ways it was easier than beginner belly dance - it doesn't have all the isolations - but there is more footwork, it's bouncier and it takes a some coordination to get the hand gestures going with everything else. The first hour of the dvd is warmup, a wee bit of namascar, and a library of basic moves and gestures all nicely broken down. I found this part kind of slow but will use it as a valuable reference. She doesn't use a lot of these moves in her choreography so you'll have to practice on your own. There is about 30 or 40 minutes breaking down a short choreography that's fun and high energy. I like that she uses some different styles and drills the choreography three times after each section. But I wish it were longer- it was my favorite part and it only felt like half of a choreography. After that there is a section that looks like a performance but is called an open practice. There is no instruction here but you can watch, attempt to follow along or practice on your own. It ends with a short meditation. I would love it if she came out with a series of these!",1435881600,,1142,4.243119266055046

I startedthis yesterday
I think this will be a fun workout

Some of the floor to standing moves are hard and hopping are hard u r olderbut overall i think its do able. So we shall see! Fun vid",1426982400,,292,3.725806451612903
4503529,5,B004YTKRBA,My daughter loves this. It's pretty basic and fun enough for a 5 year old.,1424908800,2,74,4.0
4503530,5,B004YTKRBA,I love her.  She's pretty and and genuine and joyful... but not that- Oh I'm doing a video and I'm dancing now so I have to remember to smile kind of smily- just grounded and genuinely joyful in her movements and instruction.  She goes at a slow enough pace for non-dancers to grasp the moves and explains the meanings behind the movements.  She also does the mirror view of all the movements.  Like if she says lift your left foot she's actually lifting her right- but she knows that you're facing her and so she says left so that you can follow exactly what you see on the screen.  So great.  If she does a classical dance video I will buy that one too.,1415145600,2,655,4.241935483870968
4503531,5,B004YTKRBA,"I love that Jaya breaks everything down.  It's been great fun learning the movements of each body part separately - hands, arms, feet, head, eyes, etc.  I would recommend this for the absolute beginner.",1409097600,,202,4.911764705882353
4503532,4,B004YTKRBA,"Nice DVD overall. You get the basic hand gestures, a yoga style warm up, layered footwork/hipwork to go with the hand gestures, a practice piece, and a performance. It would be nice to have an intermediate DVD also in this series.",1382486400,,230,4.634146341463414

4503557,5,B004YTKRBA,"I love this, you would not think that your going to get a workout just watching it but you can feel it and you start working up a sweat too, it really helps me tune in and be one with my body, it helped me move my hips more and be more aware of my hips, after doing this DVD it makes you want to move your hips and do the moves all the time, I will be in my kitchen standing there cooking wanting to move my hips and practice my moves, good teacher.",1364860800,2,449,3.736842105263158

Easy to understand, of course practice makes perfect, but Jaya gives plenty of practice within the routine to feel confident that you can look really good and feel great when you decide to Bollywood anywhere! I recommend this DVD to anyone wanting to learn Bollywood, spice up their dance moves, or even as an off day yogini practice as i do. You will sweat, but feel so beautiful doing it! This isn't a workout DVD, but will make you feel like you are in one. Definate MUST HAVE!!",1364774400,2,644,4.89908256880734
4503559,5,B004YTKRBA,"This instructional video did exactly what is said it would do and did it perfectly. It is a fabulous introduction to Bollywood dance giving insight into the meaning of hand gestures, providing many basic movements that can be combined in numerous ways, with ample demonstration.  It will be a while before I can do it as well as I'd like to, but that just means that this video will get plenty of play time and was well worth the investment.  Jaya is fantastic, the format is exceptional, the video and sound quality are excellent, and it is a valuable educational and cultural experience.",1353974400,2,589,4.70873786407767

4503561,5,B004YTKRBA,"Clear picture with beautiful colors.
The music is fast and up beat.
The instructions are very clear, well explained. Each movement is repeated to allow time for us to practice.
For me, I think it would be easier to follow if the instruction is done in front of a mirror.
This is a complete ""exercise"" session, with a warm up and cool down included.",1348272000,,348,4.453125
4503562,4,B004YTKRBA,"I enjoyed Jaya's dvd, the steps were very clear.  The only reason I didn't give her five stars is that, you could not practice each step for long, she sort of just move through each steps quickly.

4503563,5,B004YTKRBA,THIS IS A BASIC INTRO TO BOLLYWOOD DANCING...IT WAS COMPLETLY AS EXPECTED. JAYA VASWANI DID A GOOD JOB EXPLAINING THE HAND POSITIONS AND DEMONSTRATING THE STEPS.,1328918400,,161,5.230769230769231
4503564,3,B004YTKRBA,"I own a few Bollywood Dvds and I have also taken some workshops in Bollywood and India dances. The instruction is good but the music choice is really boring. If there is something I like about Bollywood is the energy of the dance. This cannot be appreciated in the Dvd. The music does not seem to fit the moves...Also, if you are looking to get a basic insight in mudras, I would not recommend this Dvd. The mudras showed are the very basic ones without any explanation on the meaning of them (only 5 gestures and the chapter lasts for 5 min.). For anyone that has been previously exposed to Indian culture (even in the most basic way) this Dvd will not reveal any new aspects.

I will not encourage anybody to buy this dvd. Better options can easily be found.",1325376000,13,760,4.390070921985815
4503565,5,B004YTKRBA,I'm going to buy Jaya's video.  I'm sure that it's excellent.  She was my first Bollywood dance teacher and she breaks everything down step by step.  I can't wait to see it!!!!,1322524800,,176,4.4375
8448848,4,B004YTKRBA,"A very good workout and a lot of fancy footwork! It is not low impact, however, so if you have issues with that, I would recommend ""The Sculpted Blossom"" instead.

8448850,1,B004YTKRBA,"It's not what I expected. It's a lesson that once you've gone through it, you never have to go through again, as it's mostly explanation, and not actual dancing.

8448853,5,B004YTKRBA,"I put the DVD in and started following along, at first I felt a little bit bored because she was talking so much but I do feel like the explanation was necessary and became important later on. Well after the initial explanations, wow, I kept following along and dancing and I got so into it I lost track of time. I didn't even realize than an hour and a half had passed! I have done many different workout videos from zumba to sepentine belly dance,  to insanity, but I never stay focused or lose myself in it like I did with this. It engages both mind and body at the same time.

I'm not a natural dancer by any means, not very coordinated, but this video made many of the steps easy, and I know in time I will get it and be able to dance like Jaya. I really like the way that she teaches the basic components and then puts them together, because it gives you the insight to be able to make up your own dances by speaking the language of dancing. I also like how graceful and joyful the steps are. It gives me a new perspective to dance. The video is neatly broken down into sections so you can go back to the sections you find challenging again and again. I also liked the meditation at the end.",1488758400,2,1197,4.133047210300429
