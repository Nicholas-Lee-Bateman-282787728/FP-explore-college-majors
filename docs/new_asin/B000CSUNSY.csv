8188748,5,B000CSUNSY,"Let me preface this by stating that I grew up watching the films of the Shaw Brothers and Golden Harvest, so I am a major Kung Fu movie fan and collector. Kung Faux however is not traditional ""chop socky"" fair. It actually makes fun of some of the less than excellent flicks that I saw as a child in the ""grind houses"" and on television in the late 70's and early 80's. So if your looking for traditional Old School Kung Fu movies, you must look elsewhere (many of the Shaw Brothers classics have been remastered by a company called Celestial Pictures and are available from various vendors online. You will need a multi-region DVD player to view them though as the ones with English subtitles are produced for regions other than region 1).

 Now that that's out of the way, let me tell you, I've been waiting forever for this particular volume of Kung Faux to drop. Outside of ""Box Cutta"", ""Pinky"" is my favorite episode of Kung Faux. Not only is ""Pinky"" funny but it is also daring. They took a big chance with that episode by calling a character a Spanish slang term for the female anatomy (which somehow got by the censors). It adds a whole other level of humour if you get the in-joke but it's still funny if you do not. Jean Grae is excellent as the voice of Pinky as well. If you are a fan of the Old School Kung Fu flicks and don't mind laughing again at some of the bad ones, get this. THAT'S MY WORD!",1150070400,2,1410,4.296992481203008
8188749,5,B000CSUNSY,"I have been waiting for this damn release of Kung Faux Volume 2 for over two years and I even resorted to buying a copy off of some questionable website for about twice the price in what was obviously a tv to pc ""do it yourself"" copy job that someone did of the episodes featured on this volume, but man I just couldn't wait that long for another dose of ""Mini Lee"", but i am making up for it by buying this official copy as soon as it hits the streets.- Now if they would just hurry the hell up with Volume 3, 4, & 5 so I can fix my jones for these damn things!",1135814400,2,562,3.853448275862069
