8137232,5,B000H6SY3W,"I used to watch this show all the time when I was a child and I missed it soo much. Sabrina is a great tv show, it teaches valuable life lessons!!",1336608000,,146,3.7419354838709675
8137233,5,B000H6SY3W,"I remember watching this series as a kid and loved it then. I love it even more now because I get the popculture jokes. Sure I don't get all of them because I wasn't a true child of the 90's, but there is still plenty of it. And it holds up as apropriate for kids. Some cartoons from the 90's aren't ""appropriate"" by todays standards, ie: ren n stimpy and rocco's moddern life. But as a cartoon that was produced by DIC at a time when roadcasted cartoons had to have some educational merrit, there is some, and it's still compleatly appropriate. Buy this, and further releases because there were way more than just the 14 episodes on this set.",1319328000,,643,4.366666666666666

8137236,5,B000H6SY3W,"both my sons 5 and 2 enjoy this serie a lot. nice stories. I myself enjoy it, but I guess when you see ""bewitched"" or ""Jeannie"", or ""Sabrina"" the real serie, you tend to find this cartoon ""only"" cute.",1226966400,3,200,4.153846153846154
