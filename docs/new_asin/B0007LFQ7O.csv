8048142,4,B0007LFQ7O,"Hosted by Steve Allen, this 60-minute DVD appears to begin in the midst of a program made for National Educational Television's program called ""Sounds of Summer."" That's... odd, and raises any number of questions. More information on performers and the program's origins may be found via the Library of Congress' Jazz On the Screen:[...]

The footage is marvelous, though clarity depends on the camera shot, and the performances are uniformly excellent. It is especially fun to see a younger Clark Terry standing out in an orange shirt and green pants, performing ""Mumbles,"" in the Court of Two Sisters, and clearly enjoying himself.

There is very little information on the item or its packaging except for a few key performers (with Sarah Vaughan's name misspelled), as if it does not occur to the marketing folks that specific, useful information can be a selling point. The packaging scarcely mentions Steve Allen, without a word about emcee Willis Conover, or the other organizers on the ground in New Orleans who made this event, its impressive gathering of jazz greats, and its documentation on video possible.

The outdoor blues feature in the Court of Two Sisters is followed by Paul Desmond and Gerry Mulligan, and then Dizzy Gillespie with a surprise ending, followed by Marian Love.

Then, the Basie band plays ""Cute"" and ""Lil' Darlin',"" followed by Eddie ""Lockjaw"" Davis with the band on a blazing rendition of ""Cherokee,"" and a surprisingly fiery intro by Basie into a slow blues with Richard Boone (before he moved to Denmark) on vocals, closing out with the Basie-style ""April in Paris"" that fans know and love.

Lastly, Sarah Vaughan makes her lone appearance (as another reviewer laments) to sing the Lord's Prayer, followed by a wrap-up from Steve Allen, and original closing credits with some bucolic footage of nature scenes interspersed with some performance venues and old-school public television acknowledgments.

There is surely more where these selected performances came from. Releasing more of it would be a second chance to do the material justice in depth of description and due credit.",1471132800,,2117,5.1395348837209305

8048145,1,B0007LFQ7O,I was very disappointed in this DVD. There is only one song by Sarah Vaughn singing the Lord's Prayer. Not at all what I was expecting. Dizzy Gillespie is not on this DVD even tho the advertisment says he is. There are serveral songs by a lady I've never heard. I enjoy seeing Count Basie and his band doing April in Paris. This DVD is not worth spending your money on.,1124150400,4,369,4.211267605633803
