8741028,3,B017Y6BOVQ,"I got this specifically for the diastisis recti section hoping it would give some exercises or stretches specifically for this to help heal it, but all it did was explain what it is. The yoga was super easy, would be good for someone maybe who has never done yoga but its way too basic for anyone with really any yoga experience. Not helpful for me.",1495584000,2,349,4.384615384615385
8741029,5,B017Y6BOVQ,"Wish I started this right away. Review before you deliver, I had a C-section so I assumed the 5 min would be too much right away. I could have started it in a week. Most of the 5min is breathing, meditation with 2 actual and general poses (cat and Childs). Great information on what is going on with your ab muscles though!",1474243200,,323,4.225806451612903

8741031,5,B017Y6BOVQ,"Before, during, and after all my births I have turned to yoga to not only get my body back in shape but to make me feel better all over.  Its my favorite way to get back into working out after I have a child. Its slow paced and gentle, if you do it correctly. Ive owned many different prenatal and post-natal yoga videos but none of them go through the amount of ease that this video does. t is highly recommended when beginning this video to sit through the first few chapters. Jennifer More talks passionately about how a new mother needs to ease back into the practice.  She talks about  Diastasis Recti and the Pelvic Floor. Both are topics that new moms need to know.  I recommend following Jennifer Mores Pelvic Floor Overview. It teaches you how to be aware of what muscles your using and how the proper way to use them.
After sitting through those helpful videos there is a 5 Minute Getting Back On Your Mat practice. This is the ideal practice for new mothers. Its a very slow paced practice that can be repeated for days until the new mother feels up to trying the harder and longer Yoga practices. The next steps would be the 15 Minute Postnatal Vinyasa Yoga practice and then the 30 Minute Postnatal Vinyasa Yoga practice. Each of these practices come with a gentler option for mothers who have had a  cesarean. Theres also a more advanced option for those of us who are a little more flexible. With three lovely ladies on the screen, you can easily see which option would be better for you. After each practice there is a Guided Relaxation. This is a great way to unwind, calm your body, and your mind after your practice. Jennifer More does a wonderful job. Her voice is soothing and you can tell that she cares. Shes not just there to give you a workout, shes there to give you information to care about yourself post-pregnancy.

8741032,5,B017Y6BOVQ,"I would not call myself an expert at yoga. I took some general yoga classes in college, and since then I have done a few yoga DVDs and have gone to maybe one other yoga class. I like doing yoga and feel I can do most of the moves, plus I do know there are many benefits to yoga because it is good for your mind too so I need to make sure to keep this up!

Yoga is good for anyone, but when it comes to pregnancy and postnatal, I think yoga is ideal! The Postnatal Vinyasa Yoga with Jennifer More is a DVD with good options for getting back into yoga or for starting yoga for the first time after you have your baby. With 5, 15 and 30 minute practices (yoga routines) you can ease yourself into it. This DVD is educational for guiding you through different modifications including cesarean modifications.

Jennifer More makes sure you are safe and easy on yourself in the postnatal time as your body is still healing. She talks through all those questions you have going on in your head concerning your postnatal body and advises you to talk to your doctor to make sure you are ready for this activity if you feel certain things.

Her voice is very soothing and I like how she always talks about feeling good about your body and sending positive thoughts to the part of your body that held your baby for so long. (I know it takes work for a positive body image especially after having a baby!) I wish the soothing music was a little louder, but over all I really liked the Postnatal Vinyasa Yoga With Jennifer More.

8741033,5,B017Y6BOVQ,"Jennifer More presents a wonderful resource to help new mothers transition back into a feeling of mental and physical wholeness using the practice of vinyasa yoga. It's important for viewers to watch the initial explanatory sections rather than jump right into the 5, 15 or 30 minutes practices in order to do these exercises safely. We like the feature of being able to watch each of the practice either with or without the introductory explanations. More has a friendly, approachable and warm tone that is very likeable and this DVD makes a great investment in good health for new mothers.",1453680000,2,591,4.92
8741034,5,B017Y6BOVQ,"This is a very well done Yoga video! It's perfect for the new mommy to do at home in your own time. You only need to carve out about 10 minutes and you can do it in small pieces if needed. It's specificly made for mommies who have recently given birth. It will help you get your body back in pre-baby condition, and will help with stress, aches and pains.

There are two women in the video. This is important because the one on the right is doing the yoga with modifications for those who have had c-sections. Very well thought out, easy to follow and highly recommended.",1453248000,4,571,4.287037037037037
