561837,4,6303091911,"It's a shame so few movie buffs know about these shorts.  They're low-budget affairs and can't compare technically to Hitch's features, but they offer unique rewards for fans of the Master.  ""Bon Voyage"" is especially interesting, with several recognizable Hitchcock touches (like the climax, which anticipates a similar scene in Topaz).  Sidenote:  The reason that ""Bon Voyage"" is better than ""Aventure Malgache"" is probably because it was co-written by Angus MacPhail (of Ealing Studios), who would go on to work with Hitch on The Wrong Man.

The films were restored by the British Film Institute when they were rediscovered in the early 1990s, and the restoration is pretty good considering that they were made cheaply by the British Ministry of Information and shelved for 50 years.  ""Aventure Malgache"" has fared a little better than ""Bon Voyage,"" with less debris and speckling.  But neither has any significant damage.  In short, the restoration is fine, but it's not going to wow you like the BFI's recent restoration of Michael Powell's ""Edge of the World.""

The DVD was a very early (1998) release from Milestone/Image.  As such, the transfer is OK, but would be better if done today.  The image is a little soft and a little dark.  Both films appear in the correct aspect ratio, though for some reason ""Aventure Malgache"" seems to be slightly cropped at the top of the frame.  (It's only noticeable on group close-ups.)  Considering the obscurity of these films, I doubt anyone will ever release them in better condition, and the flaws aren't significant enough to deter you from buying it.  There are no extras whatever (unless you count the liner notes, which do a satisfactory job of contextualizing the films), and the menu is uninspired.  But the chaptering is extremely generous.

All in all, this is an expensive disc for what's on offer, so I only recommend it to people who are already fans of Hitchcock.  It would've been nice if Milestone had provided more content (this title just begs for a commentary track).  But the folks at Milestone and, of course, the BFI are to be praised for getting these rarities into circulation.",1099180800,17,2148,4.949720670391062
561838,4,6303091911,"Few of Alfred Hitchcock's countless fans are aware that he made two French films, both of which are on this video. Having reached the pinnacle of success with movies such as ""Rebecca"" and ""Foreign  Correspondent"", Hitchcock was the first choice of the British  Government and the French Underground to direct ""Aventure  malgache"" (Madagascan Adventure) and ""Bon Voyage"" in 1944 to  help inspire the French freedom fighters. Can propaganda make good  entertainment? In the case of Hitchcock, it is better to ask if  entertainment can make good propaganda. Hitch's taste for ironic twists and  endless surprises made these two films almost useless to the propagandists,  but the result certainly is fun to watch. ""Aventure malgache""  keeps us guessing as a French underground lawyer outwits the gestapo after  some loose lips nearly sink the ships. In the superior ""Bon  Voyage,"" Hitchcock goes into high gear, showing us the thrilling  escape of a British flyer from a POW camp, and his subsequent fall into a  snare of Nazi treachery. Fans of the great TV series ""Alfred Hitchcock  Presents"" will especially like these two short French films, which  directly led to the TV series format. Unavailable for some 50 years, these  movies turn out to be worth the wait -- not necessarily Hitchcock at his  very greatest, but definitely rare gems for the fans of the Master of  Suspense.",954720000,23,1380,5.057777777777778

7837794,4,6303091911,"Was glad to be able to see these two movies, neither of which I had heard of before.  Both were designed to enhance the morale of French nationals, either civilians at home or Free French at war.  Both movies are short,in French, and subtitled.  Quite frankly, neither is particularly good if compared with Hitchcock's artistic/commercial films, including those, like Shadow of a Doubt, made during WWII.  But as propaganda they are quite watchable and effective.  Voyage is about WWII in Madagascar, which is something about which I--and I would imagine most others, even those interested in WWII--was totally unfamiliar, and accordingly increases my interest. I consider these films well worth seeing.",1338163200,3,703,5.297297297297297
7837795,4,6303091911,2 French-language shorts from Hitchcock made during wartime that are quite interesting.  The quality is quite good.  I feel they require a second viewing because I spent a lot of time on the subtitles durng the first.  My only problem was with the 1993 BFI copyright below the title on both shorts.,1328659200,,298,4.6923076923076925
7837796,3,6303091911,Interesting wartime shorts....the movies are in French so it requires following sub-titles (a bit of a distraction).  A bit unusual from the standard Hitcock fare; obviously driven by some wartime propaganda need for the Allies.  These are somewhat rare pieces from extensive catalog of Hitchcock movies.,1181174400,,304,5.586956521739131
7837797,4,6303091911,"Recently TCM had a Hitchcock festival and included these two shorts in their American debut.

They were made for the French audience and are in French.  They were shot in England but used French exile actors.

The description given by Amazon is very accurate on the plot (they are only about 30 minutes long.)

Wneh viewing, you must remember that they were not made as entertainment but to promote the Allied war effort.  Therefore, the story is to service this purpose.

This is a must own for any Hitchcock fans.  Or those into war propaganda films.  If you are looking for classic British Hitchcock, then look elsewhere.",1148688000,10,624,4.766355140186916
