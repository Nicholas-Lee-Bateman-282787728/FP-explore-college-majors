8336066,1,B001QNUNUW,"I ordered this item thinking it would be a great gift.  The Picture looked like it was full of items.  When I recieved the item, it was a little cardboard box with a few items thrown into it.  There was one DVD, a few tealight candles that were broken, no incense were in the box and also instead of the massage oil, they gave me a small bottle of jergens hand lotion...Really?  Not at all what I paid for.  I submitted my return 15 minutes after recieving the item.",1386979200,,466,4.191011235955056
8336067,1,B001QNUNUW,What a mess!  The candles were tealight candles that were chipped and the pieces and powder were all over everything.  No bottle of oil... just small pixie stix like tubes (2).  Incense cystals ...but I have no idea to use them.  I have not opened the videos or CD... But I imagine they will be completely cheesy!!  Save your money... skip this product!!,1312329600,3,354,4.555555555555555
