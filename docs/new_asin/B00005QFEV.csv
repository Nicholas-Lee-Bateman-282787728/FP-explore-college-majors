7950453,3,B00005QFEV,"This video tells a story of the Island of Ibiza vai some chill out tunes. If you're into the sounds of Ian Van Dahl, DJ Armin Van Buren, DJ Tiesto, Kate Ryan and other Euro sounds of a similar variety, this DVD isn't for you.  If you were looking for a video that describes the tourism of the Island this isn't for you either. It's a chill out trippy video that functions great as a back drop to a home or workspace while you're doing something else. This sound has more of a chill out, almost trippy sound to it with pictures. It's okay for the VJ scene but not something similar to the stuff put out by Moonshine. After watching this I was not impressed and would not recommend buying this DVD, but it was an okay rent if you're looking for some of the scenes. It does add to the mystery of this island. If you're an American consider Ibiza (pronounced Ibetha) the South Padre Island or Myrtle Beach of Spain with a bit more of a clubber's flair (Think Vegas with out the gambling). It's very classiy. Lots of young people there. There is a freak show, people watching element to many of the things there kind of like a Bourbon Street in New Orleans or the Carnival in Rio. This is an amazing place if you're interested in going. It is all abou the clubs, clubbing and beautiful people.",1150329600,3,1288,4.300411522633745
