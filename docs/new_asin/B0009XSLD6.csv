8069921,4,B0009XSLD6,"I must say I enjoyed this film. Although it is a truncated version of Shaw's later play, the ensemble has more to do with Chekov than Shaw. Rex Harrison, Rosemary Harris and Tom Aldredge are glitteringly good. Only Amy Irving seems out her depth and that makes for a shaky production since her character is the protagonist of the piece.

But there is such joy in watching Harrison's face close-up. He is a marvel to watch. There is such disillusionment in those watery eyes and his Shotover gives in so gracefully to the young Ellie Dunn. Rosemary Harris peels off layer after layer of her character Hesione, but in the end the layers come back together. Remak Ramsey and Tom Aldredge do some of their best work, as does Dana Ivey whose Ariadne is worthy to be called her father's daughter.

I only wish this had been the complete version is this revival was played on Broadway. Hope you can a copy of this wonderful production.",1271980800,,928,4.5843373493975905
8069922,5,B0009XSLD6,"You will not find a more compelling and finely rendered piece of live theatre anywhere than this production of Bernard Shaw's wry and satiical HEARTBREAK HOUSE.Set in the course of one evening in pre WW1 England,Shaw assembles a very complex and witty gaggle of characters who play out the silliness of the lives of uppercrust Englishfolk. Not only is this play extremely good in its own right,but the acting of stage veterans Dana Ivey, Tom Aldredge,Rosemary Harris,George Martin and a young and extremely convincing Amy Irving make this a must see for those who love the live stage and the actors who bring their characters to life without the benefit of editing and retakes. This is a real masterpiece and unfortunately rare to find. I own a vhs copy.",1175558400,4,754,4.852713178294573
