4496633,4,B004XQO8Q4,I love the old movies and especially those with Myrna Loy.  But I'm not sure that I like her paired with Don Ameche.  There's not the chemistry with him as there is with most of the other leading men she worked with.  The movie should have had more about his role as an inventor to help explain how they went from poor to wealthy enough for a maid and huge house.  She did get what she said she came for though.,1376179200,3,411,4.037037037037037
4496634,4,B004XQO8Q4,"Hiram Maxim could easily be as well known as Edison for his inventions if not for a few days here or there.  This movie is based on the GREAT book written by his son in the 1930's call ""A Genius in the Family"" which I highly recommend to anyone looking for a great Father's Day gift in the future.  As for the film, the movie takes more time focusing on the marital relationship of Ameche and Loy than the father/son relationship in the book, but it is an entertaining, family-friendly collection of stories some from the book and others created I'm sure by the MGM story department.  Either way you will enjoy yourself.  Ameche does a good job conveying the eccentric inventor with a strange manner and desire to avoid the spotlight.  Loy is great as usual as the sometimes bewildered but always stable wife and Bobby Driscoll is the young son most famously known as the voice of Peter Pan years later for Disney and for his role in Treasure Island.",1375920000,2,950,4.5
4496635,5,B004XQO8Q4,"If you like old movies, you'll love this.  Myrna Loy is beautiful in this.  I love the story...especially after they cut their sons ""girlie"" hair!  It's old-fashioned marital dedication at its best!  We can learn a few things about love and loyalty here.",1343260800,4,254,4.837209302325581
4496636,4,B004XQO8Q4,"Once upon a time, in 1867, a Boston beauty hied herself to Brooklyn to fetch a rich husband, but, to her startlement, ended up marrying a poverty-stricken inventor - thereby validating the words which open the film: ""As goes my heart, so goes my love."" SO GOES MY LOVE, I'll have you know, is an affectionate fable, a nostalgic look back. It is also a warm love story and a fudged account of the life of one of America's most prolific inventors. It's based loosely on Hiram Percy Maxim's memoirs of his eccentric father, titled A GENIUS IN THE FAMILY. It's a given that certain liberties have been taken. But don't let that dampen your enjoyment of the film.

Don Ameche, who gave us the telephone in THE STORY OF ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL, plays the now largely forgotten prolific tinkerer, Hiram Stevens Maxim, who came up with, among other gadgets, the mousetrap, the curling iron, and the first portable, fully automatic machine gun. Not that we see much of his career accomplishments. We see Hiram working on the curling iron early in the film, and that's about it. The film informs us that Hiram in time does become a successful and respected inventor, but glosses over the details of his work. The story instead focuses on Hiram's family life, and I find myself not objecting too much. Because it meant that Myrna Loy would have more screen time.

Just as William Powell is my favorite actor of all time, Myrna Loy is my favorite actress (and, yes, THE THIN MAN films play a part in this). Myrna Loy and Don Ameche demonstrate splendid chemistry. Myrna plays a strong and fairly unconventional character herself, and this makes her a perfect match for the oddball inventor. SO GOES MY LOVE, first shown in 1946, tracks their lives from fractious courtship - I loved the manner in which Ameche is able to dissuade Loy from marrying a rich, respectable suitor - to their marital years. I admit that there isn't much conflict in this film (although the last few minutes did have me concerned). The couple's squabbles are soon settled amicably, and their fights are never that serious, anyway. It's just so much fun watching two talented actors at their craft. Loy and Ameche shine even in this simplified, schmaltzy picture. Ameche and young Bobby Driscoll also manage to convey a wonderful father-and-son relationship. SO GOES MY LOVE produced frequent smiles in my household, occasionally made me laugh out loud. Is it sentimental? You betcha. It's an affectionate period film, an indulgent slice of Americana, a comforting cup of nostalgia. It's about an ambitious girl who sought wealth but stumbled upon love. That it's also about a real-life inventor is almost incidental.",1315267200,8,2678,4.832244008714597

8447343,5,B004XQO8Q4,"Great movie.  Sadly, not burned on M-DISC

I completely understand that obscure movies like this do not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would've gladly paid a dollar more for a disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Disc last 100s of years.

Great Movie !!",1483488000,,385,4.686567164179104

8447345,5,B004XQO8Q4,"Good movie.  It is always nice to see an ""old"" movie that does not have bad language and modest dress on the women.
The story line is not the greatest, but the actors are excellent.",1468886400,,181,4.171428571428572

8447347,5,B004XQO8Q4,A turn-of-the-last century with Myrna Loy smoking a cigar just before the ladies from The League show up....Don Ameche explaining how much he will need her....the little boy figuring out if he should do the naughty thing....the brilliant punishment that follows.....sigh.
