3688445,4,B001LOTU4G,"The Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!: A Little Help from My Friends DVD is very good.  I bought this DVD for my 15 month old son after reading several other positive reviews on Amazon.  My son loves the music and I like the stories and the fact you can change the language to either French or English for him.  They are really good lessons for when he's older and can understand them.  For now, he just loves watching the characters and listening to the music. I would definitely recommend this DVD to my friends.",1238803200,,498,4.380434782608695
