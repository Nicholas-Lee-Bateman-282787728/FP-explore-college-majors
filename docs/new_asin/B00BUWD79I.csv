5676834,5,B00BUWD79I,"this is a great set. very clear and I can lay down and read the smaller print. one drawback is the time spent on time periods like space travel, but that is because I saw most of it.

5676842,2,B00BUWD79I,"A compilation of many hours of video of all types from the various periods.
Poorly edited/produced onto DVD format.
No stops are inserted so if you fast forward it goes to THE END.
There are some complete movies added into the Extras.
Not the greatest ones but it adds something.",1465689600,11,279,4.6
