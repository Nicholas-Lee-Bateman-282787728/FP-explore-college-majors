3003022,5,B000XJ5TOU,I would like to do a review just based on this movie. Not the facts nor the non-facts about it. I personally do not care...history is spotted with all kinds of killings done in Gods' name. I just want to say that I loved this movie and it moved me to tears at the end. It is a powerful film and the acting was superb.,1200700800,5,317,3.8923076923076922
3003023,1,B000XJ5TOU,"I just don't get it. Creating movies based on highly manipulated facts, stretched theories, and very bias opinions just to attack a group of people. Folks, this movie is fiction. Anyone trying to tell you there are facts here is just lying. Historians still debate on what happened, and most accept this as a small group of extremists who were already on edge from being driven out of the United States by bigoted government leaders who went off the deep end. It was not ordered by any church leader and the timing of knowing this group was on the way, getting that information to Salt Lake, then back to the group with hit orders.... There were no cellphones or internet, folks.

And all that aside, ask the real question..... WHY would Mormons go killing a group of people for the fun of it? Use your brains.

This movie was just ignorant propaganda aimed at Mitt Romney who is running for President.",1200268800,14,902,4.596273291925466
3003024,3,B000XJ5TOU,"Surprised to see this film currently has a rating of 4.5 stars. I guess Mormon advocates haven't realized this item is up and open for comments. Glad I can get mine in before the comment wars begin. I liked the movie overall. As a professor of religion I know the story accords with historical facts of the Mountain Meadows massacre as well as we know them. It truly does show how human beings can do the most atrocious things to one another if they believe they receive the blessing of God in doing so. I would only wish they ask some basic epistemological questions about the justification of their claim to knowledge that it is God they are truly hearing. The film mentions possible motives like the belief the federal government was about to start a war against the Mormons and payback for the murder of Joseph Smith in Missouri. One explanation for the massacre the film does not address but needs to be explored is using religious justification for plain old greed. There was a lot of wealth, cattle and horses with that wagon train. The Paiutes didn't get it. Who did? The film nicely points out how John Lee is the only Mormon forced to suffer penalty for the event. As for the film itself, it is beautifully filmed. I thought the Davidovich character was shallow, and her death is left unexplained. The real clinker in the film, though, and the reason I reduce its rating to a three star, is the clumsily melodramatic love affair between the son of the Mormon Bishop and the daughter of the wagon train's minister. As part of that story you have the son being imprisoned by the Bishop by being chained at the ankle in a barn. The chain, though, is around his boot. Why doesn't the kid just remove his foot from the boot? That's the kind of silliness that creeps in when you import melodrama into this tragic story. My greatest concern: The Mormons (with the exception of the lovestruck son of the Bishop) were uniformly caricatured as the embodiment of hate, while those on the wagon train were uniformly portrayed as the embodiment of sweetness and light. That's too simple-minded an approach. There are other comments to be made, but I don't want to turn this into a lecture on religion. Good film, but not great by any stretch.",1199836800,46,2239,4.586034912718205
3003025,5,B000XJ5TOU,"Having seen this movie in the theaters, I was absolutely horrified at the highly actuate portrayal of the infamous Mountain Meadows Massacre in which mormons (yes, mormons) brutally slaughtered a wagon train of innocent men, women, yes, even children. Whoever wrote Amazon's grossly misleading ""product description"" which states that ""the question of whether the attack was carried out by local Paiute Indians or by a renegade sect of the Mormon church remains unresolved to this day"" is obviously a veritable moron. There is no question, none whatsoever, that the Mountain Meadows slaughter of so many innocent people was carried out by mainstream members of the mormon cult. Furthermore, this attack was not carried out by ""renegades"" - the attackers consisted of highly devote mainstream members of the cult, lead by one of their fanatics, John D. Lee - Brigham Young's ""adopted"" son. Until Lee was eventually executed as the cult's lone scapegoat (he was the only one ever ""punished"" for this abhorrent act of unabashed religious carnage), he had even appended ""Young"" to his surname. Lee was also a member of Young's ""death squad"" (the Danites), that was encharged with such benign (!?) things as carrying out their deeply held belief in ""blood atonement"" - the intentional murder of those who had committed ""sins"" in the eyes of the cult.

Mentioning Brigham Young. . .yes, he was one the main architects of the massacre, the historical record not only shows that he played an integral role in the development of the cult's extremist views (many of which continue to guide the cult to this very day) but that he was one of the key figures and hatemongers of the  prevailing mormon attitude against ""gentiles"" (the cult's term for anyone who is not a mormon). Young was personally responsible for stirring up the cult's abhorrence for anyone outside their evil sect into a maelstrom of vitriolic venom that was used to justify their bloody carnage at Mountain Meadows. At the time of the cult's blood fest, Young was preparing for an ""attack"" by the United States against ""Deseret"" (the cult's name for the territory of Utah). As noted in the book, ""American Massacre: The Tragedy at Mountain Meadows, September 1857, "" author Sally Denton cogently notes that the Fancher party (the wagon train that was slaughtered) had passed through Salt Lake City prior to the execution, and were subjected to open hostility from the cult - they were denied much needed supplies and were sent on their way. From this point on, with just one exception, they met with the same treatment as they attempted to make their way to California (obviously, they never made it). There are many, many excellent books on this topic which (unless they were given the blessings of the cult's PR machine) provide the truth on this matter.

As has been noted elsewhere, this movie does use a bit of ""artistic license"" by interweaving a ""love story"" into the otherwise accurate portrayal of this horrific historical event. While it does distract, a bit, from the actual tale, it also serves to show just how inhuman the cult really is. This movie is not for the timid but paints a very disturbing picture of the evil behind one of the world's most pernicious cults.",1197158400,43,3239,4.917733089579524
3003026,3,B000XJ5TOU,"Been waiting for this DVD to come out since first seeing it in the theatres- and having since read several histories about the historical event. There already have been numerous website slugfests about just how accurate the movie is, with most of the debate just re-emphasizing how, 150 years later, the Mormon community still struggles to reconcile this documented part of their church history.
But before the DVD is even released, and before the anticipated subsequent storm of prejudiced-laced customer ""reviews"" ( and it doesn't even matter which side they are for), let me just say that the ""editorial review"" summary ought to at least introduce the topic fairly. For one, it is hardly an issue of uncertainty whether or not Mormons participated in the massacre- indeed, the valid histories (even the source work by Juanita Brooks, herself a devout Mormon)all confirm that Mormons did most of the killing, and even eventually owned-up to that, but only after years of trying to pawn it off on the Paiute Indians. I've seen the movie and read the histories, and the only aspect of the movie which is somewhat ""over-the-top"" is its clear portrayal of Brigham Young as a main architect of the massacre; the available histories at least conclude that there is some doubt as to his actual role. Whether viewers of the movie liked the love story subplot or not isn't really what this movie is about, after all....it's just a cinematic technique used to make the history more personal (much like Cameron did with ""Titanic"", and Kate Winslett and Leonard DiCaprio).
But having said that, I'm sure the DVD release of this movie will again spark all the prejudicial comments about Mormons, etc.....but none of that changes the facts, and the movie does a fair job with that. But don't believe me- don't believe ANY reviewer: read the published histories, then you decide.",1196899200,78,1866,4.945859872611465
3003027,1,B000XJ5TOU,"Don't believe the previous statement.

The MMM happened because a wagon train was in the wrong place at the wrong time. The US Government was coming to invade Utah and Utahans were freaking out that the US army was going to wipe them out. Then comes the Fancher wagon train that passed through Utah causing gossip and horrible rumors about the train. While the leaders of the train tried to preserve peace with the Mormons, members of the group still caused problems and said things that the Mormons took seriously- from bragging about having the gun that killed LDS Founder Joseph Smith, to coming back from California with the army to subdue the Mormons, the locals wanted to take action and decided to ask Brigham Young what to do, he said to leave the train alone (in a letter that's fully documented)despite the many bad things told to him about the wagon train. Yet the letter arrived too late and the local leaders killed members of the train anyway. The locals covered up as much evidence as they could and hid their guilt and the evidence from Brigham Young. Adding to that, the US government comes to investigate, hell-bent on pinning it all on BY and giving the government a excuse to wipe out the Mormons, making the massacre nearly impossible to fully investigate and find out who truely did it.

September Dawn is based on the unrealible 'Confession' of John D. Lee, who orcastrated the massacre and finally turned on BY and the Church when he got caught and was proven guilty. Even though he previously stated BY was innocent until the court sentenced him, and also never mind that his confession was penned by his lawyer, who also wanted to smear the Church.

Sadly, pathedic bigots such as Robin here and others seek to pin it all on the Church to fit their agenda of hate, while in reality there is a complete LACK of evidence that BY and the Church leadership ordered the massacre.

SD failed at the Box Office BIG TIME; making only 10% of what the film costed to make. Movie critics, including Roger Ebert were not fooled by this piece of hatefull trash and condemned it.

3003028,5,B000XJ5TOU,"This is a great movie.  In an age of extreme political correctness, here comes a movie that dares to look at a fully home grown 19th century massacre (on September 11, no less) in the name of a paranoid religion.

I'm sure there will be an organized group of critics (Mormons?)  who will post their one star reviews.  Don't be duped.  This movie may be a scathing look at a shameful incident in the history of Mormonism -- the so-called ""mountain meadows massacre"" -- but the real theme of this film is something much greater.

World events suggest there is coming a time when we will be forced to face in a public way the problem of irrational religions based on lies and fear and hate.  What if the unthinkable happens and the West wages an all out war against a religion hell-bent on cleansing the planet of ""infidels.""  Whose God will win?  Or is that the wrong question?

Under what circumstances can we have this urgent conversation?  A start is by going to see this movie and talking about what it means to Americans today.  How do we deal with the conflicting issues of freedom and security?  Especially freedom of religion?

Is there a subjective way to even talk about a religion being ""authentic""?  Is there a way to ""love our enemies"" or should we kill them before they kill us?  This unexpected and unsettling movie about a Holy War on a small scale deserves consideration and conversation on a large scale.",1187913600,71,1420,4.553359683794467

I grew up in the Mormon church (and dropped out at age 18) and I never heard about this until a few yrs ago when someone at work was talking about it. I didn't believe it, figuring it was another anti-Mormon thing, so I started doing some research when I got home. I was pretty surprised. This is a pretty horrendous story that shouldn't be buried or glossed over.

To make it even worse, I went to Jr High and High School in Utah, and was forced to take Utah History...... this story wasn't mentioned at all. I think this movie should be shown in every UT history class, unless the story is now included in the books that are used in those classes.

The grandparents and elders of my S. Piute, Ute, and S. Shoshone classmates strongly denied ANY members ever joined in to slaughter innocents.  I was lucky find relatives of Captain Lee with an emotional edge still in their viewpoints.  Add that recent discoveries of remains nearby indicate the Army's hurried burial location wasn't adequately noted on the maps.  The ""monuments"" put up sufficed... mostly for the residents nearby.

3003095,1,B000XJ5TOU,"I tried to watch this movie with as little bias as possible, but I can't manage to see it as anything more than exploitative.

I do not question the overall truthfulness that this most dark incident in western history took place and was likely a case of tragic miscommunication, but I very much doubt almost every other detail of this movie. I have read numerous accounts of this tragedy and they just don't mesh with the dramatic liberties the producers of this movie took. They have gone so far out of their way to make every one of the immigrants look like wonderful, generous, Disney-esque people and to make every Mormon (except for one) look like sadistic, soulless, trolls. The manipulation is so blatant, it detracts from the story - it's embarrassing from both a historical and a filmmaking perspective. The narrator even goes so far as to describe the immigrant pioneers as ""a story of love"" and the Mormon's as a ""story of a hate"". Really?

If you are tempted to mistake this for an accurate documentary, note how many of these scenes depict private moments that could never be known by the writers. And note how all the scenes of leering, crazy, Mormon leaders plotting the massacre all wrap themselves up in a neat little blanket of the characters making ""solemn promises to never reveal what was talked about here today."" That's a (bad) writer's confession saying we have no idea what really happened so we're going to make up any wild thing we want and say it was done in secret.

I'm not trying to be an apologist - this was a horrific event no matter how it happened, but the 'motivation' for this tragedy as portrayed here is shallow and manipulative. If I recall from my research, the one man who was finally convicted for this really was a bit of a psycho, but this movie wants you to believe that the church itself, and not one deranged leader at a remote outpost , was responsible for it. I would have much rather watched a truthful documentary about this terrible event than a offensively fictionalized 'love story' account intended only to rile people up. Just the fact that they tried to make a love story out of it should send shivers up your spine.

If I didn't care about the accuracy of the context, the dramatic manipulation, or the ridiculously heavy-fisted emotional scene at the end, I might give it 2 stars for decent production values and acting, but, frankly, it's pretty much a bore of a movie no matter how you look at it.

The Boston Globe called it ""one-sided, ham-fisted morality tale that plays off our cultural ignorance of the Mormon religion""

To quote Roger Ebert - ""Zero stars... There isn't anything to be gained in telling this story in this way. It generates bad feelings on all sides.""",1437350400,,2736,4.630927835051547

3003148,4,B000XJ5TOU,"When I first saw this film I felt ambivalent, even slightly disappointed largely from lack of entertainment value. I feel many often sensed that too in part because the topic does not have universal understanding and appeal. But after doing some personal extensive research on the topic I was able to more readily connect with the film as well as scrutinize it's pluses and foibles. I eventually bought my own copy and on occasion do a re-watch which inevitably almost always produced some new insights I missed during the previous viewings. That is, you really have to pay attention to the film to get everything.

Rather than rehash what's already been thoroughly hashed, the construction of the film basically makes periodic well acted intense points with dramatic/romantic filler in between. I felt these intense points were reasonably accurate while the filler, fiction. I also felt Jon Voight, Terrance Stamp and Jon Gries all gave excellent performances as you would expect from veteran leading and character actors.

The viewer should keep in mind this is a dramatic movie, not a documentary that so many in the comments section wish it would be. To make a comprehensive movie sufficient to satisfy most, except for the obvious LDS plants in the comments section, it would have to be something like an 8 or 10 part series coming out of HBO or Showtime in order to fill out all the historical players, capture the entire history of what led to the massacre, and to ensure all the facts as well as the preponderance of evidence be included. This same subject could also well serve a lengthy documentary.

The Producers and/or director do take a (blatant or leading) position at times that justifiably rankle some Mormons. In those instances I found it to be a little over the top. The budget was obviously small, the period wardrobes with the exception of Voight, Stamp & Gries often inaccurate, the filming visuals very good, the dialogue good enough.

3003178,3,B000XJ5TOU,"I went into ""September Dawn"" fully aware that its theatrical reviews were not so good.  Here on Amazon, many reviewers like it to varying degrees (primarily non-Mormons) or summarily hate it (primarily Mormons).  I kept my mind open, and watched the movie.  Notwithstanding the clunky dialogue, at times terrible pacing, uneven acting, and the stereotypical roll-your-eyes love story (with the standard hokey dialogue between the lovers to accompany said stereotypical love story), I actually liked the movie in spite of its many flaws.  At its core, there's something important and worthwhile here.  It's a shame (although fully understandable) if what's meaningful gets lost underneath so much ineptness.

The movie is about the Mountain Meadows Massacre in southern Utah.  As the history goes, a caravan of cross-country settlers were traveling largely from Arkansas to California, and stopped in Southern Utah to rest and re-charge.  While initially they were accommodated by the local Mormon Bishop, eventually the LDS Church (i.e. the Mormons) decided that the travelers represented a threat and were part of a secret effort to attack the Mormons, and needed to be destroyed.  A series of attacks took place which eventually wiped out the settlers.  The attacks were done through subterfuge, with some of the Mormon attackers dressed as Native Americans in order to make the attack look like it was being initiated by them.  Where the history gets murky is whether or not Brigham Young, at the time the President of the LDS Church, authorized the attack.  What's beyond question is that the LDS Church was involved; what's unclear is to what extent.  My best guess, knowing what I know about the LDS Church and Mormon history, is that Brigham Young was involved, and probably gave the green light.

What makes this movie worthwhile is its fairly accurate representation of the broad historical narrative.  But as I watched the movie, I saw the movie less and less about Mormons versus Protestant Christians, rather than a nearly universal story about religious intolerance and bigotry, and the use of a religion to manipulate its followers to do terrible things.  The film does a superb job of showing the lengths and psychological tools that are used to manipulate a group of religious followers to commit mass murder, all in the name of God.  How many times in history has this story played out?  You can replace Mormons and Christians, with Hindus and Muslims, Jews and Palestinians, (Muslim) Turks and (Christian) Armenians, ad infinitum.  It's a story that has universality, and if one can look past the movie's many weaknesses, the core of the story is particularly compelling.

If this film interests you, you should definitely see it.  The core of the objections to this movie, as best I can tell, are either because Mormons are offended that a relatively truthful representation of a very ugly part of their church history is fully on display, or to a much lesser extent, to the amateurish nature of too many aspects of this film.  Sure, the film itself has plenty of problems.  The script needed some major re-writing. Some of the actors need remedial acting lessons (although certainly not Jon Voight).  Yet at the center of this film is something powerful and compelling, even in spite of all the things otherwise wrong with the movie.

""September Dawn"" definitely made an impact on me and it's a movie I'm sure will stay with me.  It has something important and worthwhile to say--even if it often can't get out of its own clunky way.",1406419200,2,3553,5.010221465076661

3003191,5,B000XJ5TOU,"The sheer excellence of this motion picture (Sony Pictures Home Entertainment 19816 being the North American DVD edition viewed) took me by surprise. I had expected this docudrama to be one that evangelicals would have used for their own purposes to defame L.D.S. Mormonism, with clearly apologetic aims. That is not the case, at all, to my relief. This film, without overt religious partisanship for either side, puts into nauseating light the L.D.S. Mormon perpetration of this blight upon U.S. history (which occurred, however, with even less Paiute Indian participation than it suggests), one of the most infamous genocidally and religiously motivated mass atrocities in the history of the U. S. of A. and of its then territories. This event of early Mormonism fully deserves this brutal, mostly factually accurate retelling of the massacre at Mountain Meadows, in Utah, an account that is historically and humanely motivated rather than being merely some religious cinematic diatribe.

I should have realised, even before seeing the film, that the illustrious likes of Jon Voight, Trent Ford, and Terence Stamp, among the other excellent cast, would not stoop to doing an ""hatchet job"" on Mormons for some neo-evangelical, Pentecostal, or fundamentalist Christian film outfit. The movie was shot in Alberta, the Dominion of Canada's own most Mormon-infested province, which only seems fitting. Alberta stands in reasonably well for Utah, both of them, anyway, sharing the topography of the Northwest Rockies area of the North American continent.

It is difficult for me to be entirely objective about the Mountain Meadowns Massacre. Although I was born and raised in California, I have family, both among my paternal and maternal relatives, indirectly or perhaps even directly associated with this tawdry L.D.S. Mormon incident in Western U.S. history. My mother was raised L.D.S. Mormon, hailing from Salt Lake City, her entire extended family being Mormon (until, gradually, almost all of them, one by one, became Christians over the decades, something that seldom happens in families of L.D.S. Mormon culture). My father's family hails from Arkansas, my grandmother, in fact, being from Harrison, Ark. itself, the very city from which the wagon train depicted in the film, consisting of would-be settlers from Arkansas, with some from Missouri among them, departed for California (and never made it) as this film depicts them on the Utah stretch of its fatal trek. It is even quite possible that I am descended from the mid-19th century perpetrators and/or the victims of this famous genocidal incident. (I do not know enough of my family's genealogy and history, having been raised under a step-father too hostile to my own paternal birth family and too indifferent to my mother's, to know that for certain and, anyway, my mother spoke little of these matters.) Understandably, therefore, this movie is about a slice of history that always has interested me and about which I have done much reading over the years. I can assert confidently that the film depicts what happened quite factually, apart, of course, from the romantic ""love interest"" that the movie provides between the Mormon boy and the Christian girl among the wagon train with whom the L.D.S. lad falls in love.

The acting is very, very fine; this cast, every one in it, famous or otherwise, does wonderfully well with their parts. Terence Stamp and Jonathan Voight, of course, are quite celebrated film stars. For all of that, it is Trent Ford, youthfully handsome and tenderly ardent as Jonathan, the fictitious Mormon boy who falls in love, to such tragic outcome, with a young lady among those in the wagon train, who is my own favourite among the cast.

3003202,1,B000XJ5TOU,"Should anyone be surprised that Hollywood has it's Liberal agendas? Election year anti-Mormon propaganda, anyone?
Someone asked me, ""What would the 'conservative' view of the massacre be?"" I wouldn't know. But maybe a more honest question would be, ""What would be the non-anti-Mormon, non-propaganda view of the Mountain Meadows Massacre?"" An honest view of the MMM would involve perspective. Critics and propagandists don't want perspective because it destroys their craft. They prey upon people who want easy answers rather than truth. They might feast their eyes on a Hollywood movie that infuses history with non-history and fictionalized melodramatic scenes and gasp.
What, then, would be perspective about this horrible event?  Perhaps we start by acknowledging that the affair absolutely was an atrocity; it was horrid. But fair, honest minds would simply want to know more. After searching, they would find out that the Latter-day Saints could not find justice or safety in their own country. During the first years of their history they were harassed, killed, faced an ""Extermination Order against the Mormons"" issued by the Governor of the State of Missouri (an order that was followed by a massacre of Latter-day Saints at Haun's Mill), their homes burned, their women violated, property stolen, driven from place, to place, to place. Finally their founding prophet was murdered via a conspiracy. And then one last exodus -- that involved crossing our continent, during which hundreds dropped dead by the way and buried in shallow graves.
Now, without having walked two meters in their shoes, where would you guess breaking point would be? Might you perhaps expect that there would be just a few, somewhere, who would decide on their own that enough is enough, and that if they appear to come for us again they will reap the whirlwind? There was also an atmosphere of hysteria at the time--brought on not by Brigham Young (Will Bagley's and Sally Denton's pet idea)--but by conditions and circumstances. Part of that were the rumors that the U.S. government was sending an army out to Utah to quell a ""Mormon rebellion."" The rebellion did not exist, but talk of an approaching army was true. Put it all together.
None of this excuses the isolated few for their heinous actions. But this and other truth in history may be what led non-Mormon scholar Ray Allen Billington, in his classic university text ""Westward Expansion"" to summarize his view on the Mountain Meadows Massacre by writing, ""Though the massacre was inexcusable, under the circumstances it was understandable.""",1379635200,,2586,5.171837708830549

3003208,3,B000XJ5TOU,"This is a Canadian made film which set out to dramatise the slaughter of over 120 men, women and children on the 11th September of 1857. As many of its' detractors have said this is a very biased in terms of the agenda of blame and has taken quite a few `rumours' and presented them as fact.

In the film we meet the Baker-Fancher wagon train as they enter the area of Iron County, Utah where they are stopped by the local militia and told to move on. Then Bishop Jacob Samuelson (legendary `Jon Voight')arrives with his two sons and decides to let them stay but he insists they camp at Mountain Meadow, which they agree gladly to do, as their livestock needed grazing and watering. The Bishop's son Jonathan (Trent Ford) meets with the young and pretty Emily (Tamara Hope) and it's sort of love at first sight. He is also a horse whisperer and tames an aggressive stallion in a very touching scene.

Then we move back to the Bishop who starts to whip up anti `gentile' fervour on these immigrants. Despite the advice of his son he eventually foments an attack to kill the whole wagon train. But they want to make it look like the Native American Paiute tribe carried out the attack. What unfolds is a tale based on the actual events but with a lot of anti Mormon feeling being injected for no historical reason at all. Brigham Young is played by Terence Stamp and he comes across as not having one iota of decency, which has to have been intentional.

From an historical perspective the film says this train was from Arkansas and Missouri which is true, and that as the Mormons were driven from Missouri this acted as a catalyst for their revenge. Actually the Utah War was in full swing with a distrust of all outsiders because of President Buchannan's heavy handed approach. Brigham Young had just ordered martial law and for grain to be stockpiled in case Federal troops did invade. Also Mountain Meadow was on the old Spanish trail and was well known to wagon train leaders like Fencher as he had done two trips already. The film says that the Bishop chose it as an ideal ambush point, well not that ideal as the initial attack was on the 7th September and it was only after a five day siege that the Wagon train party were duped into being disarmed and that came about because the militia thought that they had given themselves away as being white and feared about the consequences of a clearly illegal and immoral act.

The sad thing is the wagon train clearly had not realised their attackers were white or the duplicity of the Militia would not have worked. Had they realised this at the time they could have called off the slaughter, sadly they did not. So as a piece of cinema for history lovers - not that good, as a film I found it really rather engaging and very nearly a four star film. However, the material inaccuracies and the storm of controversy that this whipped up on release in America mean that this has caused harm and the spreading of lies which is unnecessary and divisive. It failed to take into account the politics of the time or the fact that Brigham Young actually sent a letter ordering the party safe passage, which sadly arrived on the 13th September. All of that said this got me interested in a piece of history that I knew nothing about and now I have had the diversion of doing some research, so it aint all bad and there are some really good performances and as I said I was quite gripped by the whole thing.",1360540800,3,3448,4.450949367088608

3003248,5,B000XJ5TOU,"""September Dawn"" (2007) is a powerful and unforgettable film. It details the long covered-up massacre at Mountain Meadows, Utah, on September 11, 1857, where a group of Mormons murdered well over a hundred settlers traveling from Arkansas to California. The settlers stopped in Utah to rest and resupply and the Mormons graciously allowed it. Unfortunately, in the ensuing days the decision was made to slaughter the settlers, likely due to paranoia over the brief ""Utah War"" that was going on at the time (between the Feds and the Mormon settlers in Utah) and also because of the Mormons' severe persecutions back East in the 1830s-40s, which provoked them to seek sanctuary in Utah in 1847.

Brigham Young was the president of the LDS denomination at the time and the governor of Utah. Was he involved in the decision to slaughter the innocent settlers? Although Mormon leaders deny this to this day it's probable for two reasons: (1.) As the LDS president and Utah governor it's unlikely that something of this magnitude would have been carried out without Young's authorization; and (2.) the leader of the slaughter, John D. Lee - the only man convicted and shot for the massacre - was the adopted son of Brigham Young. The film theorizes that the murderers took an oath of silence and that's why the massacre has been covered-up by LDS officials to this day, although Lee admitted to being the scapegoat before his execution. Chew on that.

The vibe of the film is very realistic, sort of like ""Dances With Wolves,"" although not as compelling. For instance, the Paiute natives -- whom the Mormons hoodwinked into participating in the initial assault -- are very well done. The acting is convincing across the board. In this regard ""September Dawn"" stands head & shoulders above roll-your-eyes Westerns of yesteryear.

Perhaps the film has such an authentic vibe because it's based on the historical facts and is fair with them. For one, the film utilizes Juanita Brooks' book and others as sources, and they happen to be devout Mormons. Secondly, the film reveals the valid reasons for the Mormon's paranoia - due to the Feds' harassment presently and also previous persecutions back East, severe persecutions. Thirdly, the film details a bizarre doctrine the Mormons adhered to - ""blood atonement"" - that gave them the mentality that they were doing the settlers a favor by killing them (that is, the settlers would die to this temporal world but they'd be eternally blessed, or something to this effect).

Some have criticized the film for adding a romantic subplot concerning a Mormon youth and a settler girl, but this is a typical Hollywood technique, e.g. ""Pearl Harbor,"" ""Red Baron"" and ""Titanic."" Others object to a Mormon youth cracking up after the massacre - another fictional addition - but it makes sense that an unhardened youth would lose his marbles, so to speak, after such a horrific undertaking and, again, it's portrayed in a convincing manner. Besides, who's to say something like these two subplots didn't happen? It's very possible that they did.

Although the story takes place in Southwest Utah they couldn't shoot there for obvious reasons. So they shot it in central Alberta, near Calgary. Although these locations are acceptable they lack the dryness (and therefore authenticity) of SW Utah.

Bottom Line: The harsh criticism that has been dished on this film is ridiculous and not even remotely accurate. Although it's sometimes a hard film to watch for obvious reasons, ""September Dawn"" is a worthy modern Western that dares to sneer at political correctness and tell the truth, at least as far as can be done by the documented facts. Sure there's some fictionalization, but all movies based on historical events do this to some extent and, like I said above, these fictionalizations are based on likely possibilities. I guarantee you that ""September Dawn"" is far more historically accurate than heralded films like ""Braveheart."" Since the film is so well done I can only chalk up the ridiculous criticism to intolerant liberal ideology. After all, the film dares to show Christians in a positive light being led to the slaughter literally by wacko non-Christian religious fanatics. Not that all Mormons back then or today are wacko religious fanatics, not at all, but that group that murdered the innocent settlers definitely were, and those who authorized it as well.

Although I had forgotten you can rent movies through Amazon, we rented and watched it that same night. This movie is a terrifying story about a wagon train that was massacred by a town of Mormans led by Brigham Young.

There is one flaw, the quality of the movie wasn't that great. It was pixilated at times but the story kept me from really noticing it. I would recommend for everyone to see this movie.",1342828800,4,534,4.235294117647059

Knowing much about this story from a historical viewpoint I can understand trying to draw parallels between these two September 11th tragedies. The problem is that the two are not remotely parallel. We all lived through the more recent tragedy but the accounts of 1857 require extensive research to try to understand. If you like a low budget movie that over dramatizes a horrible episode then by all means buy this movie.  If you want to get a better insight into how fear and religious persecution can spiral out of control may I suggest a good read instead.

3003253,5,B000XJ5TOU,Director Cain makes a great statement with his vision of this moment of American history. The cinematic values are great and deserves attention as a film and as message for all of us. The cinematography and other visual values and actors work great for the story.,1336953600,3,263,4.739130434782608
3003254,4,B000XJ5TOU,"For starters, in the movie's opening credits, it says that it is ""inspired"" by actual events.
The movie makes no claim to be a factual historical document.  Secondly, I'm not a Mormon, nor
do I have an axe to grind with them or religion in general.

That said, what did I think of this movie?  First  of all, it's a very relevant movie for our time.
Somebody said, ""God save us from those who God speaks to.""  That can be a Mormon in 1857, a Muslim,
a Christian, a Jew, or anybody else who claims certain knowledge of divine will.  The antagonists
in this film, have it from God that blood atonement is required for the death of Joseph Smith.  The
fact that those who must pay this price had nothing to do with that death is irrelevant because the
Mormon's are fearful of future aggrievances.

The movie does not paint a very nice picture of Mormons, so if that is going to offend you, then this
is probably not a movie for you.  But if you're some evangelical who wants to paint Mormon's as evil,
this is not something you need to be watching either.  Anders Breivik, Osama bin Laden, Jim Jones they
all have their hotline to God and this movie should be viewed as what humankind is capable of doing to
other humans in the name of God, rather than trying to place blame on somebody for something that
admittedly is merely ""inspired"" by actual events.

Although, I don't consider this a great movie, it is a compelling movie.  It's not a feel good movie
and it's not a movie I'm sure I want to watch again any time soon.  But it is a movie I'm glad that I
watched.  It's not terrible acting as some have claimed.  It's a competently done movie that's based
upon history and throws in a love story.

If you want historical accuracy about the Mountain Meadows Massacre, don't try to get it from a movie.
Watch this to be entertained and prompted to use that gray matter between the ears.  I felt like this
movie did both of those things quite nicely.  So while not warranting 5 stars, it's certainly a much
better movie than a lot of the stuff I've wasted 2 hours on.",1335744000,4,2065,4.333333333333333
3003255,2,B000XJ5TOU,"I was slightly offended that the product discription said that it is uncertain whether or not Mormons participated in the massacre at Mountain Meadows. Modern historians do not have any doubt whether or not Mormons participated, there are documented confessions and witness accounts from some of the surviving children. The real standing question is just how aware and supporting was Brigham Young of the massacre. For more information, look up the work done on the subject by Will Bagley or Juanita Brooks

I was really excited that someone was willing to address the massacre at mountain meadows in a movie, but unfortunately this one is not historically accurate. I mean, come on! You could at least have John D. Lee as one of the main characters! This movie fell short of my expectations, though I think the subject is powerful.",1332374400,2,832,4.942857142857143
3003256,1,B000XJ5TOU,"Should anyone be surprised that Hollywood has it's Liberal agendas? Election year anti-Mormon propaganda, anyone?

An honest view of the Mountain Meadows Massacre would involve perspective. Critics and propagandists don't want perspective because it destroys their craft. They prey upon people who want easy answers rather than reality. They might feast their eyes on a Hollywood movie that infuses a trace amount history with liberal swaths of non-history and fictionalized melodramatic scenes, and gasp.

What, then, would be perspective about this horrible event? Perhaps we start by acknowledging that the affair absolutely was an atrocity; it was horrid. But fair, honest minds would simply want to know more. The Latter-day Saints could not find justice or safety in their own country. During the first years of their history they were harassed, killed, faced an ""Extermination Order against the Mormons"" issued by the Governor of the State of Missouri, an order that was followed by a massacre of Latter-day Saints at Haun's Mill.  Their homes were burned, their women violated, property stolen, driven from place to place to place. Finally their founding prophet was murdered via a conspiracy. And then one last exodusthat involved crossing our continent, during which hundreds dropped dead by the way and buried in shallow graves.

Now, without having walked two meters in their shoes, where would you guess breaking point would be? Might you perhaps expect that there would be just a few, somewhere, who would decide on their own that enough is enough, and that if they appear to come for us again they will reap the whirlwind? There was also an atmosphere of hysteria at the timebrought on not by Brigham Young (Will Bagley's and Sally Denton's invention) but by conditions and circumstances. Part of that were the rumors that the U.S. government was sending an army out to Utah to quell a ""Mormon rebellion."" The rebellion did not exist, but talk of an approaching army was true. Put it all together.

None of this excuses the isolated few for their heinous actions. But this and other truth in history may be what led non-Mormon scholar Ray Allen Billington, in his classic university text ""Westward Expansion,"" to summarize his view on the Mountain Meadows Massacre by writing, ""Though the massacre was inexcusable, under the circumstances it was understandable.""",1324857600,5,2377,5.1796875

3003268,2,B000XJ5TOU,"I have watched this movie twice now so that I am ready for a review. I decided that since this movie is based on an actual historical event, I should review it both on the level of entertainment/story telling as well as historical accuracy.

ENTERTAINMENT VALUE:

This is the area where I give the movie its lowest review. Basically, this movie sucked! The love story (which is obviously used to develop the bridge between the Mormons and the wagon train) felt very forced and lacked that chemistry to make it believable. Basically, it felt like the love story was there for the sake of there being a love story. Jon Voight's character was beyond ridiculous. In Jon Voight's attempts to come off as a religious fanatic, he feels more like an insane man who makes schizophrenics seem normal. People who commit violence in the name of their religion are very angry people, but Voight just seems to be a mixture of a drug addict combined with a helping of the local village idiot. The movie seems to love painting this black and white picture of the wagon train people of being these warm loving, good Christian folk and the Mormons as being blood thirsty and demonically possessed society. In short, the characters lack dimension and credibility and the love story could have been done much better, by someone else.

HISTORICAL VALUE:

While most movies take historical licenses to make a movie entertaining, and this movie is no exception, it did do a much better job at portraying history than most historical narratives. Granted, the wagon train did not spend a week near Ceder Falls before the first attack, but the attacks and the final massacre were accurately portrayed. The sermons given by Brigham Young (Terrance Stamp) were word for word exact with the real sermons given prior to Mountain Meadows Massacre. Granted, Brigham Young did not have a British accent and Mormons were not actually killing each other to atone for their sins (probably added that to project Mormons as blood-thirsty demonic people), but there really was a tension between Mormons and outsiders and their was a growing amount of fear and resentment to the US Government. Mormons were really making an oath at this time to avenge the blood of Joseph Smith when the opportunity presented itself, giving the conditions necessary to start something as tragic as Mountain Meadows Massacre.",1308614400,4,2367,4.895261845386534
3003269,3,B000XJ5TOU,"This is the very definition of a mediocre film--it's a mix of solid performances (e.g., Jon Voigt, who seems to have cornered the market on cold, unflinching, ruthless elder statesmen/scary old white dude roles), interesting depictions of little-known historical events (like the Mountain Meadows massacre perpetrated by the Mormons), a misguided Romeo-and-Juliet style star-crossed lovers subplot (Mormon scion falls passionately in love with a young gentile woman--in the space of a week), and some of the lousiest writing ever to be foisted upon professional actors. I do credit the film for treating one of the most appalling events in the history of any religion with an appropriate mix of horror and detachment and for making a genuine effort to provide a dramatic context for the senseless slaughter of innocent pioneers at the hands of maniacal Mormon Church elders (Brigham Young among them). Other parts of the film just make very little sense, dramatically or historically--why waste 20 minutes of screen time depicting the Mormon scion's uncanny ability to ""break"" an ornery stallion? Why cast Dean Cain (yes, the Superman of ""Lois and Clark"") as Joseph Smith? (He's on screen very briefly but long enough to make you scoff at the awful casting choice.) So ultimately this film is a very mixed bag--recommended only for those who have a genuine curiosity about Mormon history.",1290297600,,1388,5.228699551569507
3003270,4,B000XJ5TOU,"I've never written a review before, though I am a big Amazon customer, buying books and Kindle books with increasing regularity.  Generally I find what I need to know for a book I'm considering buying by reading the customer reviews.  I think this feature is one of Amazon's best secret weapons to drive book sales.

In any case, after watching this move I learned that it had received some terrible press and that it had received embarassingly low ratings from some reputable critics.  I felt therefore a duty to write a short review of my impressions.  When a good movie receives uniformly bad reviews, there's often some type of cultural disconnect at work, and I venture to say that's the case here.

This movie tells the fictionalized story of newfound love set in a true account from 1857 Utah when a wagon train of settlers called the Fancher Party, bound from Arkansas to California, passes into Southern Utah at a time of great tension between the American Federal government and Brigham Young's LDS Mormon church.  The issue comes to a head when the Mormons, motivated by hatred and greed, attack the wagon train dressed as Indians, then four days later come forward under a white flag of truce claiming to be the train's protectors.  After separating the men from the women and the wounded, the Mormons set upon the separate unarmed groups and massacre more than 120 men, women, and children, sparing only six or seven children younger than age five who were thought too young to give testimony against the Mormons.  The Mormons and their Indian friends plundered the dead bodies of valuables and stole their horses and cattle, not bothering to even give proper burial to the more than 120 bodies which were left to decay to sun bleached bones in the Mountain Meadows of Utah.

To this day the Mormon church disavows any role in the massacre, claiming that Indians must have instigated the action, possibly incited by mistreatment by members of the Fancher party themselves.  It took twenty years for even a pittance of justice to visit Mountain Meadows, Utah.  It was there in 1877 when John D. Lee, Brigham Young's adopted son and local Indian farming agent, was executed for his role in the massacre.  No one else was ever publicly named or indicted or tried for this heinous act.  Given the events and the Mormon Church's continuing position, it's no wonder that this movie might be expected to generate controversy, and I suspect that controversy has bled into some of the review process.

I expected this movie to be a low budget mediocre effort, but was taken aback by the attention to detail, the cinematography, and the overall attention to detail.  Jon Voight delivers a masterful performance as bad-guy in charge under Brigham Young's authority.  I would put this movie on a par with the two latest Sherwood Pictures efforts as far as cinematic quality and acting abilitiy.

I'm 46 years old and consider myself well-read and knowledgeable about American history, and I'm ashamed that I'd never heard of this horrible event until a month ago.  Clearly the Mormons have had success in suppressing this story that really so deserves to be told.  One of the special features of the DVD involves interviews with present day descendants of relatives of the Fancher Party victims.  It's pretty powerful stuff.

Buy this movie and watch it if for no other reason than to honor the memory of the innocents slain by their own countrymen 150 years ago while they merely sought a better life for themselves.  Buy it so those who would suppress other important historically significant events will see that their efforts will ultimately fail.  Buy it so that you can begin to think for yourself about why the Mormon Church would to this day dishonor those victims by denying the true story of their deaths, and to think about what this says about Mormon leadership even today.  Finally, buy it so that you can be reminded of the fruit of the kinds of hateful teachings being imprinted onto the impressionable brains of young Muslim men in madrassahs in the Middle East right now, madrassahs funded ultimately by American petrodollars and shadowy Saudi princes..",1288828800,2,4171,4.849083215796897

They married young girls and produced babies to brainwash, they castrated their own young men if they didn't ""obey"" priesthood leaders who wanted their intended brides, they murdered, stole, lied. That is of God? A totally brainwashed sect/cult that is now trying to take over once again by getting into politics and run the country. Sound like satans kingdom rising up in the last days.

While this is ""inspired"" by a historical event, as the film itself proclaims at the beginning, the overly sharp contrast in the film between the ""Gentiles"" in the doomed wagon train and the Mormons seems overdrawn to the point of propaganda. The Mormons or at least the church leadership are essentially evil while the wagon train folks, gather a lot at the river, sing a lot of hymns and do their best to just get along with one and all, sort of Little Wagon Train on the Prairie, before being literally led as lambs to the slaughter. It just gets to be more than a bit too much after a while. I don't know if Lolita Davidovich's liberated pistol packing Western Woman in Pants in particular is based on any historical personage or not, but she seems more like a device to contrast with the Mormons and give them something more to dislike about the immigrants. Terrance Stamp as Brigham Young is interesting to watch, but most of the acting, along with the script and direction is more on a TV movie of the week level.",1280188800,4,1073,4.536082474226804

Ladies and gentlemen, that's how you play crazy with conviction and, dare I say, heart.  The obscure doctrine, blood oaths, and early fanaticism was well portrayed, as was the corrupting obtuseness of polygamy and the obvious insanity of mixing governance & religion...yes, that was a castration in the beginning.  I also loved the use of a romance between the Mormon bishop's son and a mainstream preacher's daughter as a vehicle for a religious debate, though I don't think they made use of this enough.

I did not like the generic uplifting horse/western-movie music during the first half.  Also, the directing or use of certain takes had some lines too rushed or otherwise incomprehensible to laymen.  Obscure references require less-than-obscure delivery, and reaction shots interspersed to stretch it.  The Bishop and son fighting about the dead mother is one instance.  Not the actors' fault.  While the writing was well done for the most part, sans the lack of exploiting the aforementioned debates more, there's an odd turn towards the end into cheap shots like pointing out how little education Brigham Young had or calling him the ""Mormon God"".

I think this last point might derive from a hijacking of the film by a sort of Christian Coalition or evangelical attempt to pit protestant Christians against Mormons, stemming possibly from the belief some have that Mormons are not ""Christian"" and that they worship Joseph Smith.  Certainly to each his own.  There is even a case to be made in a manner of speaking.  Yet while within the film the ""unfailing voice of God"" attribute early leaders had is out in the open for criticism by all, these associated attacks outside of the culpability in the massacre itself lacked either objectivity or even proper subjective development when used by those outside the anti-Mormon mob shown in the film.

While it's clear in the specific instance of the Mountain Meadows event that the perpetrators can be juxtaposed to the victims to show a revealing contrast in beliefs, this eventual slant in the general terms amounts to the pot calling the kettle black.  Multiple slips like that I'm afraid tipped their hand.  Ending with a country music song didn't help matters, giving September Dawn a faintly made-for-TV, patriotic right-wing cred like something that might play on God TV.  In spite of all this, the climax of the film does work.  The death scene is powerful.

Christopher Cain made a movie, but he failed to tell the whole truth in about every aspect. He fails to truly give the background to show why the Mormons had a right to feel intimidated, he failed to tell why Arkansas travelers were suspect, he failed to tell about the vile group at the back of the wagon train who threatened to return and kill all of the Mormons. His portrayal of Mormons was theatrical, not realistic, he indicated the Mormons were interested in the wealth of the wagon train, but history does not reveal this. Brigham Young did instill a fighting spirit, and that was the downfall of the Mormons who acted as they thought he might have wanted, but in reality he meant to spare the wagon train. It took two days to get messages back and forth, so the delay caused Lee to act on his feelings relative to the behavior of the rowdies in the wagon train. The movie has distorted the image of Mormons in general, and certainly the temple ceremonies and the way the way the priesthood handles itself in general. The two sons of the ""bishop"" were just plain morons. Having more than one wife had nothing to do with ""keeping score,"" and the women were loved and taken care of. In reality, the wagon train travelers were killed because some of the ""Indians"" were white men in disguise, and when the travelers discovered this, it would have been ""bad"" if the news got out, so all of the witnesses had to be disposed of.

""September Dawn"" was for me not just a reliable historical narrative, not just a riveting drama out of the Old West, not just wondrous cinematography. It is one thing more: a Hollywood flick in which, alas, versatile actor Jon Voight pretty much plays himself.

Deeply affecting.

3003321,5,B000XJ5TOU,"This is a difficult movie to watch. It's a frightening, gut-wrenching film of how Brigham Young ordered the slaughter of a wagon train filled with 140 innocent Christian men, women and children, some originating from Missouri, the death place of Joseph Smith. Their only mission was to rest on Mormon land and refuel their supplies before moving on to California.

Brigham Young, angered that someone from Missouri had killed the prophet Joseph Smith, wanted revenge, and he didn't care from whom he extracted it. He blamed his lust for blood on God, telling to his followers that God ordered the massacre of the wagon train of non-Mormon heathens. His followers blindly obeyed. They deceived the wagon train by giving them shelter and rest in an area where the perfect slaughter could take place with little resistance, and without any prior warning. Then, with the help of local Indians, and after the Mormons gained the trust of the Christians, Brigham Young ordered the brutal attack to commence. His followers separated the men from the women and children before turning their guns on the men. The women and children were slaughtered by Mormons and Indians hiding within the woods. Everyone old enough to speak - to give witness to the slaughter and the truth - was shot with arrows or bullets, stabbed, or had their throats slit, even the kids.  Newborns were spared and handed out to Mormon couples across the land, like prizes from a party.

Until seeing this movie, I'd never heard anything about the Mountain Meadows Massacre. I went searching for evidence that it didn't happen, hoping that Hollywood had over-reacted. But there is nothing to dispute it - nothing except the protest from Mormons who are angered that the truth has finally been revealed.

Jon Voight is excellent. Dean Cane has a bit role. The scenery is beautiful. The acting is superb. This movie isn't likely to be forgotten by the viewers. It's one that will stay with us for a very, very long time.",1252108800,7,1980,4.8664688427299705
3003322,3,B000XJ5TOU,"One several levels, this movie is very good.  Visually it is excellent.  The acting is also quite good.  However, as can be expected, the story line which is based on true events, has been polarized and sensationalized.  The story of the massacre would be far more interesting (not to mention accurate) if the film makers used more history to complicate the story and they did silencing certain historical factors in an effort to see the story in black and white.

 It is difficult to ""explain"" the reasons for the massacre without coming off as trying to ""excuse"" the massacre.  Nevertheless it is possible to do just that (explain without excusing) and this is what I was hoping the movie would do especially since the Mormon church does not try to make excuses for the event (rather they accept the fact that some members acted wrongfully and have publically apologized without equivocation) something  about which the movie misleads views (at the end of the film).

Of course it goes without saying that the love story and many of the characters had to be created in order to make the movie.  However, there are some problems with the movie.  The people in the wagon train are depicted in the most glowing terms while the Mormons are depicted as completely fanatical.  Are viewers really supposed to believe that every person in the wagon train was so friendly and innocent that I sometimes looked for halos over their heads?  And as for the Mormons...was every one of them so brainwashed as to participate in a massacre simply because a leader told them so?  Things were more complicated than that.
As is often the case, the Mormons are made to look like untrustworthy, fanatical, non-Christians who were extreme in their judgments against ""gentiles.""  The movie makers took too much creative liberty when they depicted Mormon women being taken and executed by the church's Apostles.  Moreover, the juxtaposition of the Pastor's prayer and the Bishop's ""prayer (curse, actually)"" was shameful.

The movie was quick to show a depiction of Joseph Smith ordering the destruction of an anti-Mormon printing press (and act which while disturbing was not technically illegal given Nauvoo's particular city charter from the state of Illinois), but they did not depict the illegal destruction of a Mormon press that occurred some years earlier.  The unsettling nature of the Danites' activates (also grossly embellished) was featured but not one single scene was included that depicted the years of persecution Mormons experienced in Ohio, Illinois and Missouri.  The movie mentions the Mormon's hatred towards Missouri, but it is strange that this ""historical"" film does not mention that this state officially decreed an ""extermination order"" wherein any and all Mormons could be (and were) driven from the state like vermin.  Because of this infamous order, a Missourian could (and did) kill a Mormon (even women and children) and not have charges brought against him.  Haun's Mill Massacre (where it was the Mormons who were deceived and massacred by non-Mormons) was not mentioned in the film either.

The film tried to make the fear of Federal Army troops marching on Utah to be an overreaction on the part of the Mormons when in fact it was a very real threat and given governments' history of abusing Mormons this threat almost certainly played a major part in the historical equation.
Finally, the idea that Brigham Young ordered the Mountain Meadows Massacre is not a fact at all.

But in the end, an egregious crime was committed by people who were Mormons.  The movie is important for bringing to light this often overlooked and tragic event.  I simply feel that the whole incident is much more interesting that the film portrayed it because the movie-makers seemed more interested in black and white depictions and sensationalism rather than complicating the situation.
One of the most interesting parts (which is mentioned, but glossed over with a sentence or two run across the screen at the end of the film) is that John D. Lee alone was scape-goated for the crime which had many many participants.

The movie is well worth watching but also well worth re-making!",1249257600,17,4175,4.979827089337176

3003329,1,B000XJ5TOU,"I think this could have been an important and powerful story to tell.  But like any movie ""based on real events"", there is an obligation to at least get the general facts right.  Sadly, that opportunity was not only missed, but it seems clear, intentionally distorted by the producer who stated in interviews that his film was to show his disdain for relgion and his belief that all relgion leads to fanatical acts of violence.  It was his ode to moral relativism between Muslim fanatics and Christian fanatics.  But, sadly, that ain't history Mr. Cain!  His film lacks all perspective in its haste to show Mormons as evil.  In his haste to make one-dimensional villains of the Mormons, to draw his imagined parallel to all religous fanatics, Caine even forgot to give the most basic context to explain the back story of the paranoia and fear that culminated in the massacre.  He forgot to mention the approaching attack of Johnston's army into the Utah territory believed to be coming to attack the Mormons, or the 600 dead Mormons along their ""trail of tears"", nor the stolen farms, murdered leaders, and ""wolf-hunt"" atrocities committed by the anti-Mormon mobs on the Mormons from 1836 to 1846.  Yet, in this ""hollywood"" movie, made for profit, only the basic colors of black and white are used, creating both false history, and poor story-telling.  Yes, the tale is tragic, but as they say; ""the devil's in the details.""  Most glaringly, the facts in history actually do NOT show a Brigham Young conspiracy, which is the core smear of this movie.  Historical facts show that Brigham Young was not even aware of the Fancher party problems (300 miles away) until the massacre had already happened.  No phones, ya know!  But, for people who like sound-bite history, with the evil slathering villains always clearly defined with silly, fanatical hand-gestures and wild eyed foaming dimentia...then this is the film for you.  The sad thing is the story itself is compelling BECAUSE of the true facts.  Yet when this film ignores the facts, and instead goes for over-dramatic, simplistic fictionalized buffoonish characters, it actually undermines the real drama by simplistic, bombastic drama-of-the-week drivel.  It becomes a vehicle of the very bigotry and hate, that it would pretend to condemn.  I found it amateurish, dishonest, and clearly designed to malign and smear instead of inform.  This story still needs to be told.  But sadly, this piece of drivel doesn't do it.  It's a propaganda film full of the very same deluded, self-righteous, condescending anti-religious hatred that it rants against.  Plus...it's just BAD acting.  To accentuate the soulessness of the Mormons, they have to be drawn as wooden, robotic, colorless drones--which also sucks the life blood out of the movie itself.  I was kinda glad when the butchery started, as at least it woke me up.  And frankly, by that point I was kinda hoping somebody would start killing the actors!  It SUCKS for so many reasons!  A good film however to demonstrate how to make a bad propaganda film.  Can someone with talent and some sense of historical obligation try this again please?",1219968000,10,3150,4.9732313575525815
3003340,3,B000XJ5TOU,"It always amazes me how so called Historians and Writers, take a one sided view of History and write their movies and books to express their view points.  In this movie it is very clear the writer and director are very anti Mormon and thus want to portray all Mormons in a negative light.  Yes they say they did their research, but to what extent.  What was it they were really looking for.  Mormons have acknowledged the fact that Mountain Meadows happened and was a tragedy.  However it was a group of misguided and misinformed individuals who took matters into their own hands.  The entire LDS Church should not be blamed as should not the entire United States for the tragedies that happened at Kirtland Ohio, Hawn's Mill in Missouri, Far West Missouri, Governor Boggs of Missouri and his extermination of Mormons order, and Nauvoo Ill.  Entire communities, The Baptist, Methodist, Catholics, Lutherans, etc.,  of those areas should not be blamed for Mormon property being  seized, women being raped, families being terrorized, yes men, women and children being murdered, the tar and feathering and the forced exodus of a religious group from a country which is suppose to protect religious freedom.  But no.  No historian or writer will create a movie with this fact in mind to show the terror Mormon people experienced in the 1830's, & 1840's and shed a negative light on other religious groups and the the United States Government for the failure to support and defend its Constitution.  With that said the movie ""September Dawn"" is a good movie for entertainment purposes only.  It is not totally historically accurate and those watching should realize that. The scenes which mentioned Polygamy and the  Temple scene are not factual.  It reminded me of the issues of the FLDS Church which is not the LDS Church.  Again, this movie should be looked at for entertainment only, and one should do their own study and research if they truly want to know the truth.  Mountain Meadows was a tragedy and should never had happened, but it was a group of individuals and not the LDS Church.  It should be interesting to note that the comment of one of the writers about what Brigham Young knew was not supported with any factual evidence only that he was the Governor of Utah and the President of the LDS Church and therefore would have known everything that went on in Utah.  Come on people, we are talking about 1857 where travel took days as well as communication.  Even today, our own political leaders don't know everything that is going on throughout our country or the world.

I'm sure the Mormons are telling their members to buy all the copies they can and burn them (it should really help sales figures), but it's a terrific film and hits the point head-on about Young's complicity in it. By the way, if you ever want to get rid of Mormons who come to your door in the middle of dinner, just ask the about the Mountain Meadows Massacre and watch them RUN!!!",1218499200,4,757,4.607407407407408
3003342,2,B000XJ5TOU,"Like much of American life, religious freedom and tolerance have evolved over time.  All today's squabbles over religious intolerance seem pretty petty compared to some past times.  Dissenters Roger Williams and Anne Hathaway were banished from their early Rhode Island community, and people sometimes killed each other over what they believed.

Before there was a millenium 9/11 by foreign forces, there was a domestic one on the plains known as the Mountain Meadows Massacre.  The beleaguered Mormons haunted by a perilous past, held onto their Utah territory with reason to believe they were to be removed by U.S. forces.  When the Fancher-Baker wagon train stopped at Mountain Meadows, they had three things in mind:  rest, replenish their supplies; then head to California.  Although many were from Arkansas, a few families followed into their train from Missouri, a place where Mormon land had been confiscated and their followers dispersed.  After leader Joseph Smith was killed in prison near Nauvoo, Illinois, the Utah Mormons, led by Brigham Young (Terence Stamp) and John D. Lee (Jon Gries), were willing to shed the blood of suspicious ""Gentiles"".  Working with Pauite Indians, the Mormons hoodwinked then massacred the migrs culminating on September 11, 1857.  Based on an apostle's allegedly heavenly visions, a question remains:  Were The Mormons deceived or did they misunderstand their messages?

Although illuminating to watch, `September Dawn' comes off as an above par made-for-TV movie.  Not as accomplished or emotionally cohesive as `Amazing Grace,' the movie remains better-than-average historical fiction.  Jon Voight as Mormon ""apostle"" Jacob Samuelton leads a lesser known cast through a drama of prejudice and counter prejudice anchored by a fictitious couple, Emily Hudson (Tamara Hope) and Jonathan Samuelton (Trent Ford).  Both being mouth-pieces of tolerance, an element of `Romeo and Juliet' enters the strife with a partially effective import.

Many of the flashback scenes of wrongs the Mormon's endured are done in old-fashioned double-imaging, thanks to editor Jack Hofstra.  The movie's often shot beautifully with a `Horse Whisperer' scene and a romantic moonlight scene to give the film some depth.  If you were queasy about 'Rambo,' you may want to be forewarned here:  Some of the footage is unsettling.  Overall, the level of interest you have in these events will effect the level of satisfaction you have with the movie.

(Comic relief:  When Emily expresses her love for Jonathan, Robert Humphries [Huntley Ritter] warns her she'll be ""...one of his many wives,"" but ""At least you'll have some help with the dishes."")

As I stifle my chuckles at their expense, let me state that I am neither an Evangelical Christian nor a Mormon; I wouldn't be either if it paid, and while I will not deny the tragedy inherent to any occasion of so many humans being killed, the particular specifics (partifics, if you will) surrounding the climactic massacre depicted in this film really make no never-nonesuch with me, so I will not make any further comment against September Dawn based on allegations of it being ""hate propaganda"". But what I can say with all of the sincerity I can scrape from the deepest walls of my empty heart is that this is easily one of the WORST films I have ever seen. Ever. Ever?

Ever.

Seeing this movie is not a memory I wish to revisit in depth, so I will relinquish the honor of discussing its specific failures to the many more seasoned critics whose heads are to be found on Rotten Tomatoes. I can, however, look back briefly enough say that the dismal quality of the acting--from all parties, amazingly enough--coupled with a script loaded with more synthetic cheese than a stuffed-crust pizza (""Hold me! Don't ever let me go!"" -- all five people in the theater with me lol'd at that one, though you might need to have endured the film to find the humor in it) make this, at absolute best, a lulzy rental--the sort of thing to fill out your rental haul as the lone child of curiosity. But be warned: everything in this movie that doesn't come off as being funny (god help you) is--and this means a lot coming from me, or so choice others would tell you--really, really boring. September Dawn is about 20% crap so crap it's awesome (read: hilarious), and 80% valium. I had to consciously fight to stay awake during this film before I realized that I wasn't coming down with ""thuh ADD""--the film was really just blandly written and directed. And while I felt horrible trying to quell my urge to laugh at a movie that set out to cover such a tragic story, it seemed that ""September Dawn"" was constructed to pose just such a challenge to the viewer. Assuming they can stay awake, that is. Anyone who sat through this film just to witness how bad it is, or to have their expectations dashed, deserves a medal. Anyone who sat through it and liked it deserves pills. Make no mistake: all questions of historical accuracy aside, this is a bad movie. A very bad movie.

Its about time!  The Mountain Meadows have been burried from widely known history for 150 years.  it has been the subject of lies, denials and twisting history by the highest authorities in the Mormon Church and now the cat is out of the bag in living color. The movie was maligned by the current leadership to the point movies did not feel comfortable showing it in Salt Lake City and only the disobedient would see the movie.  When the writer went to see it in Salt Lake City only four other people were in the movie.  When talking with a couple after the movie they were surprised the movie did not have foul language and only one fleeting image of a man geting into the Mormon Church Baptismal Pool and this an oblique angle filmed though a curtain.  After over 150 years the church is trying to keep this bloody event in the closit.  It is out now and it is about time.

Did the movie distort history?  It added a corny love story to give the film movie a time line to hang all the morbid pieces and keep it from becoming an unintereisting documentary.  No it did not distort history.

All people have the right to have a funeral.  In the funeral we tell the story of a man and a womans life.  These poor souls who were murdered at the Mountain Meadows deserve to have there story told.  This movie does this well.  And it is about time!  In the words of Teddy Roosevelt, Bully!

3003387,5,B000XJ5TOU,"Regarding the movie SEPTEMBER DAWN starring John Voight:  This is a very good recreation of an event in early Mormon history (1857). Through this cinema we see what life was for early Mormons.  The event involves the massacre of a wagon train by Mormons disguised as Indians. Why this happened, is presented from multiple perspectives. In fairness, it should be noted that Brigham Young, even though it would be hard to understand how he could not have prior knowledge of the event, was never indicted judicially or historically for the massacre. This has some significance for today, as it gives us some more insight to the fundamentalist Mormons of Eldorado, Texas who are closer in beliefs to the early Mormons, than is the LDS church itself.

3003389,5,B000XJ5TOU,"I was stunned at the fine craftsmanship and courageous candor of this film. The Mountain Meadows Massacre has been well documented outside the LDS Church and up until recently was spin doctored and rewritten into the dust by Mormon Apologists. It's been said well in other reviews but I'll echo it again, this movie very poignantly, dramatically and literately demonstrates the type of tragedy that can occur when fanaticism overcomes rational thought and behavior.

It's a hard film to watch but it's a valuable film to digest and think about.

That's because the zealot's blindness, denial, self-deception and irrational behavior that you see in this film is still very much alive today both inside and outside Mormonism. (Note:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Under-the-Banner-of-Heaven-A-Story-of-Violent-Faith/dp/1400032806/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith</a>&nbsp;is a great resource if you're interested in the ""inside"" side of that last sentence)

Regarding the ongoing Mountain Meadows Massacre controversy, I agreed with the consensus in the Special Features Documentaries of this DVD that BOTH sides would be calmed and defused by a FULL public acknowledgment of the LDS Church's culpability as well as an apology. [NOTE: A partial concession was issued on 9/11/2007 - the 150th anniversary of the massacre. See the comment I added on 6/18/2008 for the full text] I understand that this runs counter to the LDS Church's hyper-diligence on their public image (it would damage Brigham Young's spin doctored image as the infallible voice of God for example) BUT I really think that it would quiet the tumult a bit.

I would guess the characters were largely fictional with the exception possibly of Samuelson and Young, but the context seemed historical if the story was poorly presented. The Christian characters were sappy and unrealistic.

This all seems to undermine the importance of the message - that a large group of people were mercilessly slaughtered both directly by the Mormons who settled in the Mountain Meadows area, and the Indians they'd duped into doing some of their dirty work in the name of faith. In their eyes, all the world is apostate or evil if they don't agree with Joseph Smith's teachings.

The underlying message probably missed by most - although the Mormon machine today renounces plural marriage (polygamy) because of US law, it was declared a mandate for all time and eternity for the followers of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young. How can they suddenly divorce themselves from what they claimed was a mandate from God himself? It is only one of many contradictions and deceitful practices of this dangerous cult which today uses the same kinds of underhanded tactics to thwart the efforts of Christians in Utah, short of murder (in most cases.)",1208390400,7,1433,4.864754098360656

The Mountain Meadows Massacre should have been treated with more reverance, more thought and scholarship. This movie does not answer those questions with any seriousness. It moves from clich to clich simply reimforcing the silly parodies that are decades old, and still are without merit.

Not only is this film an exploitive hatchet job, it is also a missed opportunity. Obviously the director/producer Christopher Cain was more interested in making a buck, banking that his movie become profitable because of it ""controversial"" nature. It does not even do that well.

3003450,1,B000XJ5TOU,"As a graduate student of the American West I can comfortably say that this movie was so inaccurate I was not sure that it was suppose to be about the Mountain Meadows Massacre.  Every historian familiar with the story agrees.  This movie depicts the Fancher train coming through Mountain Meadows, meeting the Mormons, and then given permission to stay for two weeks at the site.  In reality, there was tension between the Mormons and the wagon train from the time they entered the territory due to the coming of the United States Army.  The Mormons were not trading or selling anything to passing wagon trains because the Mormons felt they needed to save all their supplies for the oncoming war.  This movie depicts the fanchers viewing the Mormons as buddies as they were camping and had permission to stay for two weeks, that is absurd.  The wagon train actually reached the meadows on September 5 and then attacked on September 7.  The movie tries to say that the massacre was a product of ""blood atonment,"" that is ridiculous.  Anyone who knows anything about statements and teachings about blood atonement in early Utah know it referred to apostate Mormons and other crimes worthy of the death penalty among Mormons themselves.  The Fancher party did not fit any of these categories nor is there any statments from those involved that said this was a case of blood atonment in order to save their souls. There was a meeting when the decision was made to massacre the train, but it was not about blood atonment nor did they begin chanting ""blood atonement, blood atonement.""  In addition the young man of the movie is woke up in the morning and his dad takes hime to recieve his Mormon Temple Endowments at the ""temple.""  There was no Temple in Utah in 1857.  The only place these ceremonies were held was in the endowment house in Salt Lake City.  They were in Cedar City about 250 miles away!  And the young man gets his endowments and returns home all in one day, how ridiculous.  Although the extent of Paiute involvment is hotly debated most authors believe the Paiutes were involved in the actual massacre to some extent which is left out in the movie.  There is also very little about the James Haslam letter sent by Brigham Young stating to let the immigrants pass without meddling with them but yet to keep on good terms with the Indians.  William Dame and Isaac Haight who were military and church leaders in southern Utah are two of the most responsible figures for the massacre and yet they are not even depicted in the film.  A movie about Mountain Meadows cannot be without these two very important leaders.

Surrounding the massacre was a lot of claims of how the Fancher train was being abusive to the Mormons, by all means most of these can easily be discounted but the point is there were tensions going on between them that not all the problems can be attributed to the Mormons alone.  By no means does anything justify the massacre but these contentions are not at all depicted in this silly movie.

The more likely motivations for the massacre is entirely missing.  That the Mormons in southern Utah snapped due to war hysteria with U.S. Army on its way to Utah is no where to be found in the film.  The other possible motivation was one of vengeance due to the fact that most all these immigrants were from Arkansas and that beloved Mormon leader Parley Pratt had been recently murdered in Arkansas.  None of these motivators is very well depicted.

There is no source for Young's quote of ""I am the voice of god, and anyone who doesn't like it will be hewn down."" Young's quote ""Now I will loose the Indians upon them! And if any miserable scoundrels come here to our Zion, cut their throats!,"" is actually two different speeches about two different issues. One on August 16, 1857 at the tabernacle where Young complains about emigrants shooting at Indians and with the Army coming Young would not hold the Indians back any longer. The other part about cutting throats has to do with the mobber's that Young believed drove the Mormons to the mountains and had nothing to with the Indians and comes from a speech in July 1855, two years before the event (see Journal of Discourses 2:311).

All those that know anything about the masscre know that this movie is way off the mark and is a fictional movie.  But even beyond that if you were to remove the historical inaccuracies the movie is simply terrible.  The acting is horrible.  The story of two people falling madly in love in two days is stupid.

The two Young Guns movies give a more accurate picture of the life of Billy the Kid than this movie gives of the Mountain Meadows Massarce and Youngs Guns didn't even claim to be historically accurate.  If you want to learn about the massacre then read ""The Mountain Meadows Massacre"" by Juanita Brooks, ""Blood of the Prophets"" by Will Bagley, and ""Massacre at Mountain Meadows"" by Ronald Walker (with two coauthors). This event is worthy of a real movie, hopefully one day someone will make a good movie about this horrible crime.

Every person that is even somewhat educated concerning the massacre does not like this movie.  Those that like it and say it is an ""eye opener"" or that it presents the ""truth"" that has been hidden are generally ignorant concerning the event and are simply unfamiliar with what happened.  A lot of these kool-aide drinkers will say they do not like my review, please before you mark that my review as unhelpful challenge me on any point in a comment of my review. Please, please, try to tell my where I am wrong and why EVERY historian familiar with the Massacre finds this movie laughable.",1201478400,35,5650,4.639558232931727
3003451,4,B000XJ5TOU,"The makers of September Dawn did not have a big budget, and are not contending for Oscars - they only wanted to tell a story from American history that most people never heard - the Mountain Meadows Massacre.  140 members of a wagon train, passing through Utah in 1857 - men, women and children - were murdered in cold blood by the Church of Jesus H. Christ of Latter Day Saints, the Mormons, under the direction of church president and territorial governor Brigham Young.

Two veteran actors turn in worthy performances - Jon Voight is righteously authoritarian as the Cedar City bishop, and Terence Stamp is an imposing Brigham Young.  Unfortunately, the screenwriting is weak, especially the dialogue in the opening scenes, but the narrative of events is what counts, and the filmmakers took great care to be historically accurate. The fictional romance is simply the vehicle to tell the story from both points of view.

The bishop's son is developing his own identity as a young man, questioning his father's ideas, and potentially serving as a peace broker, while he courts a young woman in the wagon train.  Like any rational person would, he begins to see the ""immigrant"" party as a means for his own escape from his father's cult.

The irony that this savage mass murder occurred on September 11 is not lost - at one point the Mormon prophet is quoted saying ""I will be the new Muhammad"" and the church leaders openly rationalize how they are doing ""gentiles"" a favor by killing them so they can be redeemed by Jesus.

The film also provides insight into the fear and hatred that the Mormon leaders felt towards these ""immigrants"" - they came from Missouri, where a Mormon leader was killed earlier that year.  They regarded Utah as their own Promised Land, and feared President James Buchanan was preparing to send the US Army to depose Brigham Young as territorial governor.  So the film explains the motive for the massacre without justifying it.

The ending is shocking, even if you know the story, and the message is how ruthless people can be when motivated by religious fanaticism, whether on 9/11/1857 or 9/11/2001.

The Mormon Church has undertaken a smear campaign against this film, accusing the producers of trying to undermine their presidential candidate.  The church disputes the level of involvement by Brigham Young as portrayed in the film, but they do not dispute the fact that the massacre occurred and was conducted by Mormons.

This film tells an important part of the history of ""how it was moving west.""  It is well worth your time.",1201132800,30,2564,4.824200913242009
3003452,5,B000XJ5TOU,"History is best told by the victors. History can also be re-written and re-imagined,. depending upon the bias and intentions of the writers. Such is the case with ""September Dawn"".

The Christopher Cain film tells the story of the Mountain Meadows Mormon Massacre of September 11, 1857 filling in the events of what could have happened during those fateful days of September.

With a fanatical edict, Brigham Young, ordered the strict observation of discouraging emigation through the Mormon controlled area of Utah a decade after their escape from persecution. Setting the stage for a conflict with the United states government, the moderate arm of the Church lost control to the fanatical element. Historical documents tell the story as one of lost communications between Young and the local Mormon Bishop Jacob Samuelson, while survivors tell a different version.

The film stars Jon Voight as Jacob Samuelson, Terrence Stamp as Brigham Young, Trent Ford as Jonathan Samuelson, and Tamara Hope as Emily, the love interest to Jonathan. This presentation is a passionate look at the much disputed massacre that casts a dark shadow on the Mormons of the mid 1800's.

Filmed in Alberta, ""September Dawn"", is a sweeping cinematic production that tries for the middle ground almost successfully. Injecting romance into the politically, religious struggle softens the film, yet its' inclusion makes the massacre more violent and senseless. Perhaps that is the true intent of the tale? In an entertainment environment inhabited by films more grandiose every year, subtle films packed with intelligent commentary are often lost in the mix. The intellectual debate over this event, especially at the 150th anniversary, has been rekindled.

Will history ever resolve what happened those two weeks as the wagon train rested? The point is moot almost as the consequences of the massacre still resonate in the church and throughout history. The DVD includes two special features to balance the facts and fiction.

This may not be the `truth', but if it is not, it is entertaining and presents a stark look at a dark moment in Mormon History. For the courage to present such a moment in time, Christopher Cain should be applauded.

It was not ordered by any church leader and the timing of knowing this group was on the way, getting that information to Salt Lake, then back to the group with hit orders....

3237521,3,B000XJ5TOU,"Surprised to see this film currently has a rating of 4.5 stars. I guess Mormon advocates haven't realized this item is up and open for comments. Glad I can get mine in before the comment wars begin. I liked the movie overall. As a professor of religion I know the story accords with historical facts of the Mountain Meadows massacre as well as we know them. It truly does show how human beings can do the most atrocious things to one another if they believe they receive the blessing of God in doing so. I would only wish they ask some basic epistemological questions about the justification of their claim to knowledge that it is God they are truly hearing. The film mentions possible motives like the belief the federal government was about to start a war against the Mormons and payback for the murder of Joseph Smith in Missouri. One explanation for the massacre the film does not address but needs to be explored is using religious justification for plain old greed. There was a lot of wealth, cattle and horses with that wagon train. The Paiutes didn't get it. Who did? The film nicely points out how John Lee is the only Mormon forced to suffer penalty for the event. As for the film itself, it is beautifully filmed. I thought the Davidovich character was shallow, and her death is left unexplained. The real clinker in the film, though, and the reason I reduce its rating to a three star, is the clumsily melodramatic love affair between the son of the Mormon Bishop and the daughter of the wagon train's minister. As part of that story you have the son being imprisoned by the Bishop by being chained at the ankle in a barn. The chain, though, is around his boot. Why doesn't the kid just remove his foot from the boot? That's the kind of silliness that creeps in when you import melodrama into this tragic story. My greatest concern: The Mormons (with the exception of the lovestruck son of the Bishop) were uniformly caricatured as the embodiment of hate, while those on the wagon train were uniformly portrayed as the embodiment of sweetness and light. That's too simple-minded an approach. There are other comments to be made, but I don't want to turn this into a lecture on religion. Good film, but not great by any stretch.",1199836800,46,2239,4.586034912718205
3237522,5,B000XJ5TOU,"Having seen this movie in the theaters, I was absolutely horrified at the highly actuate portrayal of the infamous Mountain Meadows Massacre in which mormons (yes, mormons) brutally slaughtered a wagon train of innocent men, women, yes, even children. Whoever wrote Amazon's grossly misleading ""product description"" which states that ""the question of whether the attack was carried out by local Paiute Indians or by a renegade sect of the Mormon church remains unresolved to this day"" is obviously a veritable moron. There is no question, none whatsoever, that the Mountain Meadows slaughter of so many innocent people was carried out by mainstream members of the mormon cult. Furthermore, this attack was not carried out by ""renegades"" - the attackers consisted of highly devote mainstream members of the cult, lead by one of their fanatics, John D. Lee - Brigham Young's ""adopted"" son. Until Lee was eventually executed as the cult's lone scapegoat (he was the only one ever ""punished"" for this abhorrent act of unabashed religious carnage), he had even appended ""Young"" to his surname. Lee was also a member of Young's ""death squad"" (the Danites), that was encharged with such benign (!?) things as carrying out their deeply held belief in ""blood atonement"" - the intentional murder of those who had committed ""sins"" in the eyes of the cult.

Mentioning Brigham Young. . .yes, he was one the main architects of the massacre, the historical record not only shows that he played an integral role in the development of the cult's extremist views (many of which continue to guide the cult to this very day) but that he was one of the key figures and hatemongers of the  prevailing mormon attitude against ""gentiles"" (the cult's term for anyone who is not a mormon). Young was personally responsible for stirring up the cult's abhorrence for anyone outside their evil sect into a maelstrom of vitriolic venom that was used to justify their bloody carnage at Mountain Meadows. At the time of the cult's blood fest, Young was preparing for an ""attack"" by the United States against ""Deseret"" (the cult's name for the territory of Utah). As noted in the book, ""American Massacre: The Tragedy at Mountain Meadows, September 1857, "" author Sally Denton cogently notes that the Fancher party (the wagon train that was slaughtered) had passed through Salt Lake City prior to the execution, and were subjected to open hostility from the cult - they were denied much needed supplies and were sent on their way. From this point on, with just one exception, they met with the same treatment as they attempted to make their way to California (obviously, they never made it). There are many, many excellent books on this topic which (unless they were given the blessings of the cult's PR machine) provide the truth on this matter.

As has been noted elsewhere, this movie does use a bit of ""artistic license"" by interweaving a ""love story"" into the otherwise accurate portrayal of this horrific historical event. While it does distract, a bit, from the actual tale, it also serves to show just how inhuman the cult really is. This movie is not for the timid but paints a very disturbing picture of the evil behind one of the world's most pernicious cults.",1197158400,43,3239,4.917733089579524
3237523,3,B000XJ5TOU,"Been waiting for this DVD to come out since first seeing it in the theatres- and having since read several histories about the historical event. There already have been numerous website slugfests about just how accurate the movie is, with most of the debate just re-emphasizing how, 150 years later, the Mormon community still struggles to reconcile this documented part of their church history.
But before the DVD is even released, and before the anticipated subsequent storm of prejudiced-laced customer ""reviews"" ( and it doesn't even matter which side they are for), let me just say that the ""editorial review"" summary ought to at least introduce the topic fairly. For one, it is hardly an issue of uncertainty whether or not Mormons participated in the massacre- indeed, the valid histories (even the source work by Juanita Brooks, herself a devout Mormon)all confirm that Mormons did most of the killing, and even eventually owned-up to that, but only after years of trying to pawn it off on the Paiute Indians. I've seen the movie and read the histories, and the only aspect of the movie which is somewhat ""over-the-top"" is its clear portrayal of Brigham Young as a main architect of the massacre; the available histories at least conclude that there is some doubt as to his actual role. Whether viewers of the movie liked the love story subplot or not isn't really what this movie is about, after all....it's just a cinematic technique used to make the history more personal (much like Cameron did with ""Titanic"", and Kate Winslett and Leonard DiCaprio).
But having said that, I'm sure the DVD release of this movie will again spark all the prejudicial comments about Mormons, etc.....but none of that changes the facts, and the movie does a fair job with that.

Then comes the Fancher wagon train that passed through Utah causing gossip and horrible rumors about the train. While the leaders of the train tried to preserve peace with the Mormons, members of the group still caused problems and said things that the Mormons took seriously- from bragging about having the gun that killed LDS Founder Joseph Smith, to coming back from California with the army to subdue the Mormons, the locals wanted to take action and decided to ask Brigham Young what to do, he said to leave the train alone (in a letter that's fully documented)despite the many bad things told to him about the wagon train. Yet the letter arrived too late and the local leaders killed members of the train anyway. The locals covered up as much evidence as they could and hid their guilt and the evidence from Brigham Young. Adding to that, the US government comes to investigate, hell-bent on pinning it all on BY and giving the government a excuse to wipe out the Mormons, making the massacre nearly impossible to fully investigate and find out who truely did it.

September Dawn is based on the unrealible 'Confession' of John D. Lee, who orcastrated the massacre and finally turned on BY and the Church when he got caught and was proven guilty. Even though he previously stated BY was innocent until the court sentenced him, and also never mind that his confession was penned by his lawyer, who also wanted to smear the Church.

Sadly, pathedic bigots such as Robin here and others seek to pin it all on the Church to fit their agenda of hate, while in reality there is a complete LACK of evidence that BY and the Church leadership ordered the massacre.

SD failed at the Box Office BIG TIME; making only 10% of what the film costed to make. Movie critics, including Roger Ebert were not fooled by this piece of hatefull trash and condemned it.

3237525,5,B000XJ5TOU,"This is a great movie.  In an age of extreme political correctness, here comes a movie that dares to look at a fully home grown 19th century massacre (on September 11, no less) in the name of a paranoid religion.

I'm sure there will be an organized group of critics (Mormons?)  who will post their one star reviews.  Don't be duped.  This movie may be a scathing look at a shameful incident in the history of Mormonism -- the so-called ""mountain meadows massacre"" -- but the real theme of this film is something much greater.

World events suggest there is coming a time when we will be forced to face in a public way the problem of irrational religions based on lies and fear and hate.  What if the unthinkable happens and the West wages an all out war against a religion hell-bent on cleansing the planet of ""infidels.""  Whose God will win?  Or is that the wrong question?

Under what circumstances can we have this urgent conversation?  A start is by going to see this movie and talking about what it means to Americans today.  How do we deal with the conflicting issues of freedom and security?  Especially freedom of religion?

Is there a subjective way to even talk about a religion being ""authentic""?  Is there a way to ""love our enemies"" or should we kill them before they kill us?

3237592,1,B000XJ5TOU,"I tried to watch this movie with as little bias as possible, but I can't manage to see it as anything more than exploitative.

I do not question the overall truthfulness that this most dark incident in western history took place and was likely a case of tragic miscommunication, but I very much doubt almost every other detail of this movie. I have read numerous accounts of this tragedy and they just don't mesh with the dramatic liberties the producers of this movie took. They have gone so far out of their way to make every one of the immigrants look like wonderful, generous, Disney-esque people and to make every Mormon (except for one) look like sadistic, soulless, trolls. The manipulation is so blatant, it detracts from the story - it's embarrassing from both a historical and a filmmaking perspective. The narrator even goes so far as to describe the immigrant pioneers as ""a story of love"" and the Mormon's as a ""story of a hate"". Really?

If you are tempted to mistake this for an accurate documentary, note how many of these scenes depict private moments that could never be known by the writers. And note how all the scenes of leering, crazy, Mormon leaders plotting the massacre all wrap themselves up in a neat little blanket of the characters making ""solemn promises to never reveal what was talked about here today."" That's a (bad) writer's confession saying we have no idea what really happened so we're going to make up any wild thing we want and say it was done in secret.

I'm not trying to be an apologist - this was a horrific event no matter how it happened, but the 'motivation' for this tragedy as portrayed here is shallow and manipulative. If I recall from my research, the one man who was finally convicted for this really was a bit of a psycho, but this movie wants you to believe that the church itself, and not one deranged leader at a remote outpost , was responsible for it. I would have much rather watched a truthful documentary about this terrible event than a offensively fictionalized 'love story' account intended only to rile people up. Just the fact that they tried to make a love story out of it should send shivers up your spine.

If I didn't care about the accuracy of the context, the dramatic manipulation, or the ridiculously heavy-fisted emotional scene at the end, I might give it 2 stars for decent production values and acting, but, frankly, it's pretty much a bore of a movie no matter how you look at it.

The Boston Globe called it ""one-sided, ham-fisted morality tale that plays off our cultural ignorance of the Mormon religion""

3237645,4,B000XJ5TOU,"When I first saw this film I felt ambivalent, even slightly disappointed largely from lack of entertainment value. I feel many often sensed that too in part because the topic does not have universal understanding and appeal. But after doing some personal extensive research on the topic I was able to more readily connect with the film as well as scrutinize it's pluses and foibles. I eventually bought my own copy and on occasion do a re-watch which inevitably almost always produced some new insights I missed during the previous viewings. That is, you really have to pay attention to the film to get everything.

Rather than rehash what's already been thoroughly hashed, the construction of the film basically makes periodic well acted intense points with dramatic/romantic filler in between. I felt these intense points were reasonably accurate while the filler, fiction. I also felt Jon Voight, Terrance Stamp and Jon Gries all gave excellent performances as you would expect from veteran leading and character actors.

The viewer should keep in mind this is a dramatic movie, not a documentary that so many in the comments section wish it would be. To make a comprehensive movie sufficient to satisfy most, except for the obvious LDS plants in the comments section, it would have to be something like an 8 or 10 part series coming out of HBO or Showtime in order to fill out all the historical players, capture the entire history of what led to the massacre, and to ensure all the facts as well as the preponderance of evidence be included. This same subject could also well serve a lengthy documentary.

The Producers and/or director do take a (blatant or leading) position at times that justifiably rankle some Mormons. In those instances I found it to be a little over the top. The budget was obviously small, the period wardrobes with the exception of Voight, Stamp & Gries often inaccurate, the filming visuals very good, the dialogue good enough.

3237675,3,B000XJ5TOU,"I went into ""September Dawn"" fully aware that its theatrical reviews were not so good.  Here on Amazon, many reviewers like it to varying degrees (primarily non-Mormons) or summarily hate it (primarily Mormons).  I kept my mind open, and watched the movie.  Notwithstanding the clunky dialogue, at times terrible pacing, uneven acting, and the stereotypical roll-your-eyes love story (with the standard hokey dialogue between the lovers to accompany said stereotypical love story), I actually liked the movie in spite of its many flaws.  At its core, there's something important and worthwhile here.  It's a shame (although fully understandable) if what's meaningful gets lost underneath so much ineptness.

The movie is about the Mountain Meadows Massacre in southern Utah.  As the history goes, a caravan of cross-country settlers were traveling largely from Arkansas to California, and stopped in Southern Utah to rest and re-charge.  While initially they were accommodated by the local Mormon Bishop, eventually the LDS Church (i.e. the Mormons) decided that the travelers represented a threat and were part of a secret effort to attack the Mormons, and needed to be destroyed.  A series of attacks took place which eventually wiped out the settlers.  The attacks were done through subterfuge, with some of the Mormon attackers dressed as Native Americans in order to make the attack look like it was being initiated by them.  Where the history gets murky is whether or not Brigham Young, at the time the President of the LDS Church, authorized the attack.  What's beyond question is that the LDS Church was involved; what's unclear is to what extent.  My best guess, knowing what I know about the LDS Church and Mormon history, is that Brigham Young was involved, and probably gave the green light.

What makes this movie worthwhile is its fairly accurate representation of the broad historical narrative.  But as I watched the movie, I saw the movie less and less about Mormons versus Protestant Christians, rather than a nearly universal story about religious intolerance and bigotry, and the use of a religion to manipulate its followers to do terrible things.  The film does a superb job of showing the lengths and psychological tools that are used to manipulate a group of religious followers to commit mass murder, all in the name of God.  How many times in history has this story played out?  You can replace Mormons and Christians, with Hindus and Muslims, Jews and Palestinians, (Muslim) Turks and (Christian) Armenians, ad infinitum.  It's a story that has universality, and if one can look past the movie's many weaknesses, the core of the story is particularly compelling.

If this film interests you, you should definitely see it.  The core of the objections to this movie, as best I can tell, are either because Mormons are offended that a relatively truthful representation of a very ugly part of their church history is fully on display, or to a much lesser extent, to the amateurish nature of too many aspects of this film.  Sure, the film itself has plenty of problems.  The script needed some major re-writing. Some of the actors need remedial acting lessons (although certainly not Jon Voight).  Yet at the center of this film is something powerful and compelling, even in spite of all the things otherwise wrong with the movie.

""September Dawn"" definitely made an impact on me and it's a movie I'm sure will stay with me.  It has something important and worthwhile to say--even if it often can't get out of its own clunky way.",1406419200,2,3553,5.010221465076661

3237688,5,B000XJ5TOU,"The sheer excellence of this motion picture (Sony Pictures Home Entertainment 19816 being the North American DVD edition viewed) took me by surprise. I had expected this docudrama to be one that evangelicals would have used for their own purposes to defame L.D.S. Mormonism, with clearly apologetic aims. That is not the case, at all, to my relief. This film, without overt religious partisanship for either side, puts into nauseating light the L.D.S. Mormon perpetration of this blight upon U.S. history (which occurred, however, with even less Paiute Indian participation than it suggests), one of the most infamous genocidally and religiously motivated mass atrocities in the history of the U. S. of A. and of its then territories. This event of early Mormonism fully deserves this brutal, mostly factually accurate retelling of the massacre at Mountain Meadows, in Utah, an account that is historically and humanely motivated rather than being merely some religious cinematic diatribe.

I should have realised, even before seeing the film, that the illustrious likes of Jon Voight, Trent Ford, and Terence Stamp, among the other excellent cast, would not stoop to doing an ""hatchet job"" on Mormons for some neo-evangelical, Pentecostal, or fundamentalist Christian film outfit. The movie was shot in Alberta, the Dominion of Canada's own most Mormon-infested province, which only seems fitting. Alberta stands in reasonably well for Utah, both of them, anyway, sharing the topography of the Northwest Rockies area of the North American continent.

It is difficult for me to be entirely objective about the Mountain Meadowns Massacre. Although I was born and raised in California, I have family, both among my paternal and maternal relatives, indirectly or perhaps even directly associated with this tawdry L.D.S. Mormon incident in Western U.S. history. My mother was raised L.D.S. Mormon, hailing from Salt Lake City, her entire extended family being Mormon (until, gradually, almost all of them, one by one, became Christians over the decades, something that seldom happens in families of L.D.S. Mormon culture). My father's family hails from Arkansas, my grandmother, in fact, being from Harrison, Ark. itself, the very city from which the wagon train depicted in the film, consisting of would-be settlers from Arkansas, with some from Missouri among them, departed for California (and never made it) as this film depicts them on the Utah stretch of its fatal trek. It is even quite possible that I am descended from the mid-19th century perpetrators and/or the victims of this famous genocidal incident. (I do not know enough of my family's genealogy and history, having been raised under a step-father too hostile to my own paternal birth family and too indifferent to my mother's, to know that for certain and, anyway, my mother spoke little of these matters.) Understandably, therefore, this movie is about a slice of history that always has interested me and about which I have done much reading over the years. I can assert confidently that the film depicts what happened quite factually, apart, of course, from the romantic ""love interest"" that the movie provides between the Mormon boy and the Christian girl among the wagon train with whom the L.D.S. lad falls in love.

The acting is very, very fine; this cast, every one in it, famous or otherwise, does wonderfully well with their parts. Terence Stamp and Jonathan Voight, of course, are quite celebrated film stars. For all of that, it is Trent Ford, youthfully handsome and tenderly ardent as Jonathan, the fictitious Mormon boy who falls in love, to such tragic outcome, with a young lady among those in the wagon train, who is my own favourite among the cast. The extra features are both historically illuminating and very worthwhile to view before or after watching the film itself. The subtitles, of which I followed those in English, are clear and, fortunately, helpful and not at all unduly intrusive.",1399420800,,3978,5.173913043478261

I should have realised, even before seeing the film, that the illustrious likes of Jon Voight, Trent Ford, and Terence Stamp, among the other excellent cast, would not stoop to doing an ""hatchet job"" on Mormons for some neo-evangelical, Pentecostal, or fundamentalist Christian film outfit. The movie was shot in Alberta, the Dominion of Canada's own most Mormon-infested province, which only seems fitting. Alberta stands in reasonably well for Utah, both of them, anyway, sharing the topography of the Northwest Rockies area of the North American continent.

It is difficult for me to be entirely objective about the Mountain Meadowns Massacre. Although I was born and raised in California, I have family, both among my paternal and maternal relatives, indirectly or perhaps even directly associated with this tawdry L.D.S. Mormon incident in Western U.S. history. My mother was raised L.D.S. Mormon, hailing from Salt Lake City, her entire extended family being Mormon (until, gradually, almost all of them, one by one, became Christians over the decades, something that seldom happens in families of L.D.S. Mormon culture). My father's family hails from Arkansas, my grandmother, in fact, being from Harrison, Ark. itself, the very city from which the wagon train depicted in the film, consisting of would-be settlers from Arkansas, with some from Missouri among them, departed for California (and never made it) as this film depicts them on the Utah stretch of its fatal trek. It is even quite possible that I am descended from the mid-19th century perpetrators and/or the victims of this famous genocidal incident. (I do not know enough of my family's genealogy and history, having been raised under a step-father too hostile to my own paternal birth family and too indifferent to my mother's, to know that for certain and, anyway, my mother spoke little of these matters.) Understandably, therefore, this movie is about a slice of history that always has interested me and about which I have done much reading over the years. I can assert confidently that the film depicts what happened quite factually, apart, of course, from the romantic ""love interest"" that the movie provides between the Mormon boy and the Christian girl among the wagon train with whom the L.D.S. lad falls in love.

The acting is very, very fine; this cast, every one in it, famous or otherwise, does wonderfully well with their parts. Terence Stamp and Jonathan Voight, of course, are quite celebrated film stars. For all of that, it is Trent Ford, youthfully handsome and tenderly ardent as Jonathan, the fictitious Mormon boy who falls in love, to such tragic outcome, with a young lady among those in the wagon train, who is my own favourite among the cast. The extra features are both historically illuminating and very worthwhile to view before or after watching the film itself.

Someone asked me, ""What would the 'conservative' view of the massacre be?"" I wouldn't know. But maybe a more honest question would be, ""What would be the non-anti-Mormon, non-propaganda view of the Mountain Meadows Massacre?"" An honest view of the MMM would involve perspective. Critics and propagandists don't want perspective because it destroys their craft. They prey upon people who want easy answers rather than truth. They might feast their eyes on a Hollywood movie that infuses history with non-history and fictionalized melodramatic scenes and gasp.
What, then, would be perspective about this horrible event?  Perhaps we start by acknowledging that the affair absolutely was an atrocity; it was horrid. But fair, honest minds would simply want to know more. After searching, they would find out that the Latter-day Saints could not find justice or safety in their own country. During the first years of their history they were harassed, killed, faced an ""Extermination Order against the Mormons"" issued by the Governor of the State of Missouri (an order that was followed by a massacre of Latter-day Saints at Haun's Mill), their homes burned, their women violated, property stolen, driven from place, to place, to place. Finally their founding prophet was murdered via a conspiracy. And then one last exodus -- that involved crossing our continent, during which hundreds dropped dead by the way and buried in shallow graves.
Now, without having walked two meters in their shoes, where would you guess breaking point would be? Might you perhaps expect that there would be just a few, somewhere, who would decide on their own that enough is enough, and that if they appear to come for us again they will reap the whirlwind? There was also an atmosphere of hysteria at the time--brought on not by Brigham Young (Will Bagley's and Sally Denton's pet idea)--but by conditions and circumstances. Part of that were the rumors that the U.S. government was sending an army out to Utah to quell a ""Mormon rebellion."" The rebellion did not exist, but talk of an approaching army was true. Put it all together.
None of this excuses the isolated few for their heinous actions.

3237705,3,B000XJ5TOU,"This is a Canadian made film which set out to dramatise the slaughter of over 120 men, women and children on the 11th September of 1857. As many of its' detractors have said this is a very biased in terms of the agenda of blame and has taken quite a few `rumours' and presented them as fact.

In the film we meet the Baker-Fancher wagon train as they enter the area of Iron County, Utah where they are stopped by the local militia and told to move on. Then Bishop Jacob Samuelson (legendary `Jon Voight')arrives with his two sons and decides to let them stay but he insists they camp at Mountain Meadow, which they agree gladly to do, as their livestock needed grazing and watering. The Bishop's son Jonathan (Trent Ford) meets with the young and pretty Emily (Tamara Hope) and it's sort of love at first sight. He is also a horse whisperer and tames an aggressive stallion in a very touching scene.

Then we move back to the Bishop who starts to whip up anti `gentile' fervour on these immigrants. Despite the advice of his son he eventually foments an attack to kill the whole wagon train. But they want to make it look like the Native American Paiute tribe carried out the attack. What unfolds is a tale based on the actual events but with a lot of anti Mormon feeling being injected for no historical reason at all. Brigham Young is played by Terence Stamp and he comes across as not having one iota of decency, which has to have been intentional.

From an historical perspective the film says this train was from Arkansas and Missouri which is true, and that as the Mormons were driven from Missouri this acted as a catalyst for their revenge. Actually the Utah War was in full swing with a distrust of all outsiders because of President Buchannan's heavy handed approach. Brigham Young had just ordered martial law and for grain to be stockpiled in case Federal troops did invade. Also Mountain Meadow was on the old Spanish trail and was well known to wagon train leaders like Fencher as he had done two trips already. The film says that the Bishop chose it as an ideal ambush point, well not that ideal as the initial attack was on the 7th September and it was only after a five day siege that the Wagon train party were duped into being disarmed and that came about because the militia thought that they had given themselves away as being white and feared about the consequences of a clearly illegal and immoral act.

The sad thing is the wagon train clearly had not realised their attackers were white or the duplicity of the Militia would not have worked. Had they realised this at the time they could have called off the slaughter, sadly they did not. So as a piece of cinema for history lovers - not that good, as a film I found it really rather engaging and very nearly a four star film. However, the material inaccuracies and the storm of controversy that this whipped up on release in America mean that this has caused harm and the spreading of lies which is unnecessary and divisive. It failed to take into account the politics of the time or the fact that Brigham Young actually sent a letter ordering the party safe passage, which sadly arrived on the 13th September. All of that said this got me interested in a piece of history that I knew nothing about and now I have had the diversion of doing some research, so it aint all bad and there are some really good performances and as I said I was quite gripped by the whole thing.",1360540800,3,3448,4.450949367088608

3237745,5,B000XJ5TOU,"""September Dawn"" (2007) is a powerful and unforgettable film. It details the long covered-up massacre at Mountain Meadows, Utah, on September 11, 1857, where a group of Mormons murdered well over a hundred settlers traveling from Arkansas to California. The settlers stopped in Utah to rest and resupply and the Mormons graciously allowed it. Unfortunately, in the ensuing days the decision was made to slaughter the settlers, likely due to paranoia over the brief ""Utah War"" that was going on at the time (between the Feds and the Mormon settlers in Utah) and also because of the Mormons' severe persecutions back East in the 1830s-40s, which provoked them to seek sanctuary in Utah in 1847.

Brigham Young was the president of the LDS denomination at the time and the governor of Utah. Was he involved in the decision to slaughter the innocent settlers? Although Mormon leaders deny this to this day it's probable for two reasons: (1.) As the LDS president and Utah governor it's unlikely that something of this magnitude would have been carried out without Young's authorization; and (2.) the leader of the slaughter, John D. Lee - the only man convicted and shot for the massacre - was the adopted son of Brigham Young. The film theorizes that the murderers took an oath of silence and that's why the massacre has been covered-up by LDS officials to this day, although Lee admitted to being the scapegoat before his execution. Chew on that.

The vibe of the film is very realistic, sort of like ""Dances With Wolves,"" although not as compelling. For instance, the Paiute natives -- whom the Mormons hoodwinked into participating in the initial assault -- are very well done. The acting is convincing across the board. In this regard ""September Dawn"" stands head & shoulders above roll-your-eyes Westerns of yesteryear.

Perhaps the film has such an authentic vibe because it's based on the historical facts and is fair with them. For one, the film utilizes Juanita Brooks' book and others as sources, and they happen to be devout Mormons. Secondly, the film reveals the valid reasons for the Mormon's paranoia - due to the Feds' harassment presently and also previous persecutions back East, severe persecutions. Thirdly, the film details a bizarre doctrine the Mormons adhered to - ""blood atonement"" - that gave them the mentality that they were doing the settlers a favor by killing them (that is, the settlers would die to this temporal world but they'd be eternally blessed, or something to this effect).

Some have criticized the film for adding a romantic subplot concerning a Mormon youth and a settler girl, but this is a typical Hollywood technique, e.g. ""Pearl Harbor,"" ""Red Baron"" and ""Titanic."" Others object to a Mormon youth cracking up after the massacre - another fictional addition - but it makes sense that an unhardened youth would lose his marbles, so to speak, after such a horrific undertaking and, again, it's portrayed in a convincing manner. Besides, who's to say something like these two subplots didn't happen? It's very possible that they did.

Although the story takes place in Southwest Utah they couldn't shoot there for obvious reasons. So they shot it in central Alberta, near Calgary. Although these locations are acceptable they lack the dryness (and therefore authenticity) of SW Utah.

Bottom Line: The harsh criticism that has been dished on this film is ridiculous and not even remotely accurate. Although it's sometimes a hard film to watch for obvious reasons, ""September Dawn"" is a worthy modern Western that dares to sneer at political correctness and tell the truth, at least as far as can be done by the documented facts. Sure there's some fictionalization, but all movies based on historical events do this to some extent and, like I said above, these fictionalizations are based on likely possibilities. I guarantee you that ""September Dawn"" is far more historically accurate than heralded films like ""Braveheart."" Since the film is so well done I can only chalk up the ridiculous criticism to intolerant liberal ideology. After all, the film dares to show Christians in a positive light being led to the slaughter literally by wacko non-Christian religious fanatics. Not that all Mormons back then or today are wacko religious fanatics, not at all, but that group that murdered the innocent settlers definitely were, and those who authorized it as well.

We all lived through the more recent tragedy but the accounts of 1857 require extensive research to try to understand. If you like a low budget movie that over dramatizes a horrible episode then by all means buy this movie.  If you want to get a better insight into how fear and religious persecution can spiral out of control may I suggest a good read instead.

3237751,4,B000XJ5TOU,"For starters, in the movie's opening credits, it says that it is ""inspired"" by actual events.
The movie makes no claim to be a factual historical document.  Secondly, I'm not a Mormon, nor
do I have an axe to grind with them or religion in general.

That said, what did I think of this movie?  First  of all, it's a very relevant movie for our time.
Somebody said, ""God save us from those who God speaks to.""  That can be a Mormon in 1857, a Muslim,
a Christian, a Jew, or anybody else who claims certain knowledge of divine will.  The antagonists
in this film, have it from God that blood atonement is required for the death of Joseph Smith.  The
fact that those who must pay this price had nothing to do with that death is irrelevant because the
Mormon's are fearful of future aggrievances.

The movie does not paint a very nice picture of Mormons, so if that is going to offend you, then this
is probably not a movie for you.  But if you're some evangelical who wants to paint Mormon's as evil,
this is not something you need to be watching either.  Anders Breivik, Osama bin Laden, Jim Jones they
all have their hotline to God and this movie should be viewed as what humankind is capable of doing to
other humans in the name of God, rather than trying to place blame on somebody for something that
admittedly is merely ""inspired"" by actual events.

Although, I don't consider this a great movie, it is a compelling movie.  It's not a feel good movie
and it's not a movie I'm sure I want to watch again any time soon.  But it is a movie I'm glad that I
watched.  It's not terrible acting as some have claimed.  It's a competently done movie that's based
upon history and throws in a love story.

If you want historical accuracy about the Mountain Meadows Massacre, don't try to get it from a movie.
Watch this to be entertained and prompted to use that gray matter between the ears.  I felt like this
movie did both of those things quite nicely.  So while not warranting 5 stars, it's certainly a much
better movie than a lot of the stuff I've wasted 2 hours on.",1335744000,4,2065,4.333333333333333

During the first years of their history they were harassed, killed, faced an ""Extermination Order against the Mormons"" issued by the Governor of the State of Missouri, an order that was followed by a massacre of Latter-day Saints at Haun's Mill.  Their homes were burned, their women violated, property stolen, driven from place to place to place. Finally their founding prophet was murdered via a conspiracy. And then one last exodusthat involved crossing our continent, during which hundreds dropped dead by the way and buried in shallow graves.

Now, without having walked two meters in their shoes, where would you guess breaking point would be? Might you perhaps expect that there would be just a few, somewhere, who would decide on their own that enough is enough, and that if they appear to come for us again they will reap the whirlwind? There was also an atmosphere of hysteria at the timebrought on not by Brigham Young (Will Bagley's and Sally Denton's invention) but by conditions and circumstances. Part of that were the rumors that the U.S. government was sending an army out to Utah to quell a ""Mormon rebellion."" The rebellion did not exist, but talk of an approaching army was true. Put it all together.

None of this excuses the isolated few for their heinous actions. But this and other truth in history may be what led non-Mormon scholar Ray Allen Billington, in his classic university text ""Westward Expansion,"" to summarize his view on the Mountain Meadows Massacre by writing, ""Though the massacre was inexcusable, under the circumstances it was understandable.""",1324857600,5,2377,5.1796875

3237765,2,B000XJ5TOU,"I have watched this movie twice now so that I am ready for a review. I decided that since this movie is based on an actual historical event, I should review it both on the level of entertainment/story telling as well as historical accuracy.

ENTERTAINMENT VALUE:

This is the area where I give the movie its lowest review. Basically, this movie sucked! The love story (which is obviously used to develop the bridge between the Mormons and the wagon train) felt very forced and lacked that chemistry to make it believable. Basically, it felt like the love story was there for the sake of there being a love story. Jon Voight's character was beyond ridiculous. In Jon Voight's attempts to come off as a religious fanatic, he feels more like an insane man who makes schizophrenics seem normal. People who commit violence in the name of their religion are very angry people, but Voight just seems to be a mixture of a drug addict combined with a helping of the local village idiot. The movie seems to love painting this black and white picture of the wagon train people of being these warm loving, good Christian folk and the Mormons as being blood thirsty and demonically possessed society. In short, the characters lack dimension and credibility and the love story could have been done much better, by someone else.

HISTORICAL VALUE:

While most movies take historical licenses to make a movie entertaining, and this movie is no exception, it did do a much better job at portraying history than most historical narratives. Granted, the wagon train did not spend a week near Ceder Falls before the first attack, but the attacks and the final massacre were accurately portrayed. The sermons given by Brigham Young (Terrance Stamp) were word for word exact with the real sermons given prior to Mountain Meadows Massacre. Granted, Brigham Young did not have a British accent and Mormons were not actually killing each other to atone for their sins (probably added that to project Mormons as blood-thirsty demonic people), but there really was a tension between Mormons and outsiders and their was a growing amount of fear and resentment to the US Government. Mormons were really making an oath at this time to avenge the blood of Joseph Smith when the opportunity presented itself, giving the conditions necessary to start something as tragic as Mountain Meadows Massacre.",1308614400,4,2367,4.895261845386534
3237766,3,B000XJ5TOU,"This is the very definition of a mediocre film--it's a mix of solid performances (e.g., Jon Voigt, who seems to have cornered the market on cold, unflinching, ruthless elder statesmen/scary old white dude roles), interesting depictions of little-known historical events (like the Mountain Meadows massacre perpetrated by the Mormons), a misguided Romeo-and-Juliet style star-crossed lovers subplot (Mormon scion falls passionately in love with a young gentile woman--in the space of a week), and some of the lousiest writing ever to be foisted upon professional actors. I do credit the film for treating one of the most appalling events in the history of any religion with an appropriate mix of horror and detachment and for making a genuine effort to provide a dramatic context for the senseless slaughter of innocent pioneers at the hands of maniacal Mormon Church elders (Brigham Young among them). Other parts of the film just make very little sense, dramatically or historically--why waste 20 minutes of screen time depicting the Mormon scion's uncanny ability to ""break"" an ornery stallion? Why cast Dean Cain (yes, the Superman of ""Lois and Clark"") as Joseph Smith? (He's on screen very briefly but long enough to make you scoff at the awful casting choice.)

3237767,4,B000XJ5TOU,"I've never written a review before, though I am a big Amazon customer, buying books and Kindle books with increasing regularity.  Generally I find what I need to know for a book I'm considering buying by reading the customer reviews.  I think this feature is one of Amazon's best secret weapons to drive book sales.

In any case, after watching this move I learned that it had received some terrible press and that it had received embarassingly low ratings from some reputable critics.  I felt therefore a duty to write a short review of my impressions.  When a good movie receives uniformly bad reviews, there's often some type of cultural disconnect at work, and I venture to say that's the case here.

This movie tells the fictionalized story of newfound love set in a true account from 1857 Utah when a wagon train of settlers called the Fancher Party, bound from Arkansas to California, passes into Southern Utah at a time of great tension between the American Federal government and Brigham Young's LDS Mormon church.  The issue comes to a head when the Mormons, motivated by hatred and greed, attack the wagon train dressed as Indians, then four days later come forward under a white flag of truce claiming to be the train's protectors.  After separating the men from the women and the wounded, the Mormons set upon the separate unarmed groups and massacre more than 120 men, women, and children, sparing only six or seven children younger than age five who were thought too young to give testimony against the Mormons.  The Mormons and their Indian friends plundered the dead bodies of valuables and stole their horses and cattle, not bothering to even give proper burial to the more than 120 bodies which were left to decay to sun bleached bones in the Mountain Meadows of Utah.

To this day the Mormon church disavows any role in the massacre, claiming that Indians must have instigated the action, possibly incited by mistreatment by members of the Fancher party themselves.  It took twenty years for even a pittance of justice to visit Mountain Meadows, Utah.  It was there in 1877 when John D. Lee, Brigham Young's adopted son and local Indian farming agent, was executed for his role in the massacre.  No one else was ever publicly named or indicted or tried for this heinous act.  Given the events and the Mormon Church's continuing position, it's no wonder that this movie might be expected to generate controversy, and I suspect that controversy has bled into some of the review process.

I expected this movie to be a low budget mediocre effort, but was taken aback by the attention to detail, the cinematography, and the overall attention to detail.  Jon Voight delivers a masterful performance as bad-guy in charge under Brigham Young's authority.  I would put this movie on a par with the two latest Sherwood Pictures efforts as far as cinematic quality and acting abilitiy.

I'm 46 years old and consider myself well-read and knowledgeable about American history, and I'm ashamed that I'd never heard of this horrible event until a month ago.  Clearly the Mormons have had success in suppressing this story that really so deserves to be told.  One of the special features of the DVD involves interviews with present day descendants of relatives of the Fancher Party victims.  It's pretty powerful stuff.

Buy this movie and watch it if for no other reason than to honor the memory of the innocents slain by their own countrymen 150 years ago while they merely sought a better life for themselves.  Buy it so those who would suppress other important historically significant events will see that their efforts will ultimately fail.  Buy it so that you can begin to think for yourself about why the Mormon Church would to this day dishonor those victims by denying the true story of their deaths, and to think about what this says about Mormon leadership even today.  Finally, buy it so that you can be reminded of the fruit of the kinds of hateful teachings being imprinted onto the impressionable brains of young Muslim men in madrassahs in the Middle East right now, madrassahs funded ultimately by American petrodollars and shadowy Saudi princes..",1288828800,2,4171,4.849083215796897

They married young girls and produced babies to brainwash, they castrated their own young men if they didn't ""obey"" priesthood leaders who wanted their intended brides, they murdered, stole, lied. That is of God? A totally brainwashed sect/cult that is now trying to take over once again by getting into politics and run the country. Sound like satans kingdom rising up in the last days.

While this is ""inspired"" by a historical event, as the film itself proclaims at the beginning, the overly sharp contrast in the film between the ""Gentiles"" in the doomed wagon train and the Mormons seems overdrawn to the point of propaganda. The Mormons or at least the church leadership are essentially evil while the wagon train folks, gather a lot at the river, sing a lot of hymns and do their best to just get along with one and all, sort of Little Wagon Train on the Prairie, before being literally led as lambs to the slaughter. It just gets to be more than a bit too much after a while. I don't know if Lolita Davidovich's liberated pistol packing Western Woman in Pants in particular is based on any historical personage or not, but she seems more like a device to contrast with the Mormons and give them something more to dislike about the immigrants. Terrance Stamp as Brigham Young is interesting to watch, but most of the acting, along with the script and direction is more on a TV movie of the week level.",1280188800,4,1073,4.536082474226804

3237788,3,B000XJ5TOU,"The actors did a nice job.  I can't imagine anyone else playing zealot quite like Voight.  Ladies and gentlemen, that's how you play crazy with conviction and, dare I say, heart.  The obscure doctrine, blood oaths, and early fanaticism was well portrayed, as was the corrupting obtuseness of polygamy and the obvious insanity of mixing governance & religion...yes, that was a castration in the beginning.  I also loved the use of a romance between the Mormon bishop's son and a mainstream preacher's daughter as a vehicle for a religious debate, though I don't think they made use of this enough.

I did not like the generic uplifting horse/western-movie music during the first half.  Also, the directing or use of certain takes had some lines too rushed or otherwise incomprehensible to laymen.  Obscure references require less-than-obscure delivery, and reaction shots interspersed to stretch it.  The Bishop and son fighting about the dead mother is one instance.  Not the actors' fault.  While the writing was well done for the most part, sans the lack of exploiting the aforementioned debates more, there's an odd turn towards the end into cheap shots like pointing out how little education Brigham Young had or calling him the ""Mormon God"".

I think this last point might derive from a hijacking of the film by a sort of Christian Coalition or evangelical attempt to pit protestant Christians against Mormons, stemming possibly from the belief some have that Mormons are not ""Christian"" and that they worship Joseph Smith.  Certainly to each his own.  There is even a case to be made in a manner of speaking.  Yet while within the film the ""unfailing voice of God"" attribute early leaders had is out in the open for criticism by all, these associated attacks outside of the culpability in the massacre itself lacked either objectivity or even proper subjective development when used by those outside the anti-Mormon mob shown in the film.

While it's clear in the specific instance of the Mountain Meadows event that the perpetrators can be juxtaposed to the victims to show a revealing contrast in beliefs, this eventual slant in the general terms amounts to the pot calling the kettle black.  Multiple slips like that I'm afraid tipped their hand.  Ending with a country music song didn't help matters, giving September Dawn a faintly made-for-TV, patriotic right-wing cred like something that might play on God TV.  In spite of all this, the climax of the film does work.  The death scene is powerful.  We are left with a sense of having been shown a very obvious trend of culture, preceding timeline, and complex psychologies that led to yet another example of systemic mass murder.",1262476800,2,2692,4.97986577181208

Christopher Cain made a movie, but he failed to tell the whole truth in about every aspect. He fails to truly give the background to show why the Mormons had a right to feel intimidated, he failed to tell why Arkansas travelers were suspect, he failed to tell about the vile group at the back of the wagon train who threatened to return and kill all of the Mormons. His portrayal of Mormons was theatrical, not realistic, he indicated the Mormons were interested in the wealth of the wagon train, but history does not reveal this. Brigham Young did instill a fighting spirit, and that was the downfall of the Mormons who acted as they thought he might have wanted, but in reality he meant to spare the wagon train. It took two days to get messages back and forth, so the delay caused Lee to act on his feelings relative to the behavior of the rowdies in the wagon train. The movie has distorted the image of Mormons in general, and certainly the temple ceremonies and the way the way the priesthood handles itself in general. The two sons of the ""bishop"" were just plain morons. Having more than one wife had nothing to do with ""keeping score,"" and the women were loved and taken care of. In reality, the wagon train travelers were killed because some of the ""Indians"" were white men in disguise, and when the travelers discovered this, it would have been ""bad"" if the news got out, so all of the witnesses had to be disposed of.

3237818,5,B000XJ5TOU,"This is a difficult movie to watch. It's a frightening, gut-wrenching film of how Brigham Young ordered the slaughter of a wagon train filled with 140 innocent Christian men, women and children, some originating from Missouri, the death place of Joseph Smith. Their only mission was to rest on Mormon land and refuel their supplies before moving on to California.

Brigham Young, angered that someone from Missouri had killed the prophet Joseph Smith, wanted revenge, and he didn't care from whom he extracted it. He blamed his lust for blood on God, telling to his followers that God ordered the massacre of the wagon train of non-Mormon heathens. His followers blindly obeyed. They deceived the wagon train by giving them shelter and rest in an area where the perfect slaughter could take place with little resistance, and without any prior warning. Then, with the help of local Indians, and after the Mormons gained the trust of the Christians, Brigham Young ordered the brutal attack to commence. His followers separated the men from the women and children before turning their guns on the men. The women and children were slaughtered by Mormons and Indians hiding within the woods. Everyone old enough to speak - to give witness to the slaughter and the truth - was shot with arrows or bullets, stabbed, or had their throats slit, even the kids.  Newborns were spared and handed out to Mormon couples across the land, like prizes from a party.

Until seeing this movie, I'd never heard anything about the Mountain Meadows Massacre. I went searching for evidence that it didn't happen, hoping that Hollywood had over-reacted. But there is nothing to dispute it - nothing except the protest from Mormons who are angered that the truth has finally been revealed.

Jon Voight is excellent. Dean Cane has a bit role. The scenery is beautiful. The acting is superb. This movie isn't likely to be forgotten by the viewers. It's one that will stay with us for a very, very long time.",1252108800,7,1980,4.8664688427299705
3237819,3,B000XJ5TOU,"One several levels, this movie is very good.  Visually it is excellent.  The acting is also quite good.  However, as can be expected, the story line which is based on true events, has been polarized and sensationalized.  The story of the massacre would be far more interesting (not to mention accurate) if the film makers used more history to complicate the story and they did silencing certain historical factors in an effort to see the story in black and white.

 It is difficult to ""explain"" the reasons for the massacre without coming off as trying to ""excuse"" the massacre.  Nevertheless it is possible to do just that (explain without excusing) and this is what I was hoping the movie would do especially since the Mormon church does not try to make excuses for the event (rather they accept the fact that some members acted wrongfully and have publically apologized without equivocation) something  about which the movie misleads views (at the end of the film).

Of course it goes without saying that the love story and many of the characters had to be created in order to make the movie.  However, there are some problems with the movie.  The people in the wagon train are depicted in the most glowing terms while the Mormons are depicted as completely fanatical.  Are viewers really supposed to believe that every person in the wagon train was so friendly and innocent that I sometimes looked for halos over their heads?  And as for the Mormons...was every one of them so brainwashed as to participate in a massacre simply because a leader told them so?  Things were more complicated than that.
As is often the case, the Mormons are made to look like untrustworthy, fanatical, non-Christians who were extreme in their judgments against ""gentiles.""  The movie makers took too much creative liberty when they depicted Mormon women being taken and executed by the church's Apostles.  Moreover, the juxtaposition of the Pastor's prayer and the Bishop's ""prayer (curse, actually)"" was shameful.

The movie was quick to show a depiction of Joseph Smith ordering the destruction of an anti-Mormon printing press (and act which while disturbing was not technically illegal given Nauvoo's particular city charter from the state of Illinois), but they did not depict the illegal destruction of a Mormon press that occurred some years earlier.  The unsettling nature of the Danites' activates (also grossly embellished) was featured but not one single scene was included that depicted the years of persecution Mormons experienced in Ohio, Illinois and Missouri.  The movie mentions the Mormon's hatred towards Missouri, but it is strange that this ""historical"" film does not mention that this state officially decreed an ""extermination order"" wherein any and all Mormons could be (and were) driven from the state like vermin.  Because of this infamous order, a Missourian could (and did) kill a Mormon (even women and children) and not have charges brought against him.  Haun's Mill Massacre (where it was the Mormons who were deceived and massacred by non-Mormons) was not mentioned in the film either.

The film tried to make the fear of Federal Army troops marching on Utah to be an overreaction on the part of the Mormons when in fact it was a very real threat and given governments' history of abusing Mormons this threat almost certainly played a major part in the historical equation.
Finally, the idea that Brigham Young ordered the Mountain Meadows Massacre is not a fact at all.

But in the end, an egregious crime was committed by people who were Mormons.  The movie is important for bringing to light this often overlooked and tragic event.  I simply feel that the whole incident is much more interesting that the film portrayed it because the movie-makers seemed more interested in black and white depictions and sensationalism rather than complicating the situation.
One of the most interesting parts (which is mentioned, but glossed over with a sentence or two run across the screen at the end of the film) is that John D. Lee alone was scape-goated for the crime which had many many participants.

3237826,1,B000XJ5TOU,"I think this could have been an important and powerful story to tell.  But like any movie ""based on real events"", there is an obligation to at least get the general facts right.  Sadly, that opportunity was not only missed, but it seems clear, intentionally distorted by the producer who stated in interviews that his film was to show his disdain for relgion and his belief that all relgion leads to fanatical acts of violence.  It was his ode to moral relativism between Muslim fanatics and Christian fanatics.  But, sadly, that ain't history Mr. Cain!  His film lacks all perspective in its haste to show Mormons as evil.  In his haste to make one-dimensional villains of the Mormons, to draw his imagined parallel to all religous fanatics, Caine even forgot to give the most basic context to explain the back story of the paranoia and fear that culminated in the massacre.  He forgot to mention the approaching attack of Johnston's army into the Utah territory believed to be coming to attack the Mormons, or the 600 dead Mormons along their ""trail of tears"", nor the stolen farms, murdered leaders, and ""wolf-hunt"" atrocities committed by the anti-Mormon mobs on the Mormons from 1836 to 1846.  Yet, in this ""hollywood"" movie, made for profit, only the basic colors of black and white are used, creating both false history, and poor story-telling.  Yes, the tale is tragic, but as they say; ""the devil's in the details.""  Most glaringly, the facts in history actually do NOT show a Brigham Young conspiracy, which is the core smear of this movie.  Historical facts show that Brigham Young was not even aware of the Fancher party problems (300 miles away) until the massacre had already happened.  No phones, ya know!  But, for people who like sound-bite history, with the evil slathering villains always clearly defined with silly, fanatical hand-gestures and wild eyed foaming dimentia...then this is the film for you.  The sad thing is the story itself is compelling BECAUSE of the true facts.  Yet when this film ignores the facts, and instead goes for over-dramatic, simplistic fictionalized buffoonish characters, it actually undermines the real drama by simplistic, bombastic drama-of-the-week drivel.  It becomes a vehicle of the very bigotry and hate, that it would pretend to condemn.  I found it amateurish, dishonest, and clearly designed to malign and smear instead of inform.  This story still needs to be told.  But sadly, this piece of drivel doesn't do it.  It's a propaganda film full of the very same deluded, self-righteous, condescending anti-religious hatred that it rants against.  Plus...it's just BAD acting.  To accentuate the soulessness of the Mormons, they have to be drawn as wooden, robotic, colorless drones--which also sucks the life blood out of the movie itself.  I was kinda glad when the butchery started, as at least it woke me up.  And frankly, by that point I was kinda hoping somebody would start killing the actors!  It SUCKS for so many reasons!  A good film however to demonstrate how to make a bad propaganda film.  Can someone with talent and some sense of historical obligation try this again please?",1219968000,10,3150,4.9732313575525815
3237837,3,B000XJ5TOU,"It always amazes me how so called Historians and Writers, take a one sided view of History and write their movies and books to express their view points.  In this movie it is very clear the writer and director are very anti Mormon and thus want to portray all Mormons in a negative light.  Yes they say they did their research, but to what extent.  What was it they were really looking for.  Mormons have acknowledged the fact that Mountain Meadows happened and was a tragedy.  However it was a group of misguided and misinformed individuals who took matters into their own hands.  The entire LDS Church should not be blamed as should not the entire United States for the tragedies that happened at Kirtland Ohio, Hawn's Mill in Missouri, Far West Missouri, Governor Boggs of Missouri and his extermination of Mormons order, and Nauvoo Ill.  Entire communities, The Baptist, Methodist, Catholics, Lutherans, etc.,  of those areas should not be blamed for Mormon property being  seized, women being raped, families being terrorized, yes men, women and children being murdered, the tar and feathering and the forced exodus of a religious group from a country which is suppose to protect religious freedom.  But no.  No historian or writer will create a movie with this fact in mind to show the terror Mormon people experienced in the 1830's, & 1840's and shed a negative light on other religious groups and the the United States Government for the failure to support and defend its Constitution.  With that said the movie ""September Dawn"" is a good movie for entertainment purposes only.  It is not totally historically accurate and those watching should realize that. The scenes which mentioned Polygamy and the  Temple scene are not factual.  It reminded me of the issues of the FLDS Church which is not the LDS Church.  Again, this movie should be looked at for entertainment only, and one should do their own study and research if they truly want to know the truth.  Mountain Meadows was a tragedy and should never had happened, but it was a group of individuals and not the LDS Church.  It should be interesting to note that the comment of one of the writers about what Brigham Young knew was not supported with any factual evidence only that he was the Governor of Utah and the President of the LDS Church and therefore would have known everything that went on in Utah.  Come on people, we are talking about 1857 where travel took days as well as communication.  Even today, our own political leaders don't know everything that is going on throughout our country or the world.

The LDS church has NEVER come close to admitting even knowledge of the incident, much less full-blown blame for it. Brigham Young not only knew about it; he ORDERED it, just as portrayed in the film. I'm sure the Mormons are telling their members to buy all the copies they can and burn them (it should really help sales figures), but it's a terrific film and hits the point head-on about Young's complicity in it. By the way, if you ever want to get rid of Mormons who come to your door in the middle of dinner, just ask the about the Mountain Meadows Massacre and watch them RUN!!!",1218499200,4,757,4.607407407407408
3237839,2,B000XJ5TOU,"Like much of American life, religious freedom and tolerance have evolved over time.  All today's squabbles over religious intolerance seem pretty petty compared to some past times.  Dissenters Roger Williams and Anne Hathaway were banished from their early Rhode Island community, and people sometimes killed each other over what they believed.

Before there was a millenium 9/11 by foreign forces, there was a domestic one on the plains known as the Mountain Meadows Massacre.  The beleaguered Mormons haunted by a perilous past, held onto their Utah territory with reason to believe they were to be removed by U.S. forces.  When the Fancher-Baker wagon train stopped at Mountain Meadows, they had three things in mind:  rest, replenish their supplies; then head to California.  Although many were from Arkansas, a few families followed into their train from Missouri, a place where Mormon land had been confiscated and their followers dispersed.  After leader Joseph Smith was killed in prison near Nauvoo, Illinois, the Utah Mormons, led by Brigham Young (Terence Stamp) and John D. Lee (Jon Gries), were willing to shed the blood of suspicious ""Gentiles"".  Working with Pauite Indians, the Mormons hoodwinked then massacred the migrs culminating on September 11, 1857.  Based on an apostle's allegedly heavenly visions, a question remains:  Were The Mormons deceived or did they misunderstand their messages?

Although illuminating to watch, `September Dawn' comes off as an above par made-for-TV movie.  Not as accomplished or emotionally cohesive as `Amazing Grace,' the movie remains better-than-average historical fiction.  Jon Voight as Mormon ""apostle"" Jacob Samuelton leads a lesser known cast through a drama of prejudice and counter prejudice anchored by a fictitious couple, Emily Hudson (Tamara Hope) and Jonathan Samuelton (Trent Ford).  Both being mouth-pieces of tolerance, an element of `Romeo and Juliet' enters the strife with a partially effective import.

Many of the flashback scenes of wrongs the Mormon's endured are done in old-fashioned double-imaging, thanks to editor Jack Hofstra.  The movie's often shot beautifully with a `Horse Whisperer' scene and a romantic moonlight scene to give the film some depth.  If you were queasy about 'Rambo,' you may want to be forewarned here:  Some of the footage is unsettling.  Overall, the level of interest you have in these events will effect the level of satisfaction you have with the movie.

(Comic relief:  When Emily expresses her love for Jonathan, Robert Humphries [Huntley Ritter] warns her she'll be ""...one of his many wives,"" but ""At least you'll have some help with the dishes."")

As I stifle my chuckles at their expense, let me state that I am neither an Evangelical Christian nor a Mormon; I wouldn't be either if it paid, and while I will not deny the tragedy inherent to any occasion of so many humans being killed, the particular specifics (partifics, if you will) surrounding the climactic massacre depicted in this film really make no never-nonesuch with me, so I will not make any further comment against September Dawn based on allegations of it being ""hate propaganda"". But what I can say with all of the sincerity I can scrape from the deepest walls of my empty heart is that this is easily one of the WORST films I have ever seen. Ever. Ever?

Ever.

Seeing this movie is not a memory I wish to revisit in depth, so I will relinquish the honor of discussing its specific failures to the many more seasoned critics whose heads are to be found on Rotten Tomatoes. I can, however, look back briefly enough say that the dismal quality of the acting--from all parties, amazingly enough--coupled with a script loaded with more synthetic cheese than a stuffed-crust pizza (""Hold me! Don't ever let me go!"" -- all five people in the theater with me lol'd at that one, though you might need to have endured the film to find the humor in it) make this, at absolute best, a lulzy rental--the sort of thing to fill out your rental haul as the lone child of curiosity. But be warned: everything in this movie that doesn't come off as being funny (god help you) is--and this means a lot coming from me, or so choice others would tell you--really, really boring. September Dawn is about 20% crap so crap it's awesome (read: hilarious), and 80% valium. I had to consciously fight to stay awake during this film before I realized that I wasn't coming down with ""thuh ADD""--the film was really just blandly written and directed. And while I felt horrible trying to quell my urge to laugh at a movie that set out to cover such a tragic story, it seemed that ""September Dawn"" was constructed to pose just such a challenge to the viewer. Assuming they can stay awake, that is. Anyone who sat through this film just to witness how bad it is, or to have their expectations dashed, deserves a medal. Anyone who sat through it and liked it deserves pills. Make no mistake: all questions of historical accuracy aside, this is a bad movie. A very bad movie.

Its about time!  The Mountain Meadows have been burried from widely known history for 150 years.  it has been the subject of lies, denials and twisting history by the highest authorities in the Mormon Church and now the cat is out of the bag in living color. The movie was maligned by the current leadership to the point movies did not feel comfortable showing it in Salt Lake City and only the disobedient would see the movie.  When the writer went to see it in Salt Lake City only four other people were in the movie.  When talking with a couple after the movie they were surprised the movie did not have foul language and only one fleeting image of a man geting into the Mormon Church Baptismal Pool and this an oblique angle filmed though a curtain.  After over 150 years the church is trying to keep this bloody event in the closit.  It is out now and it is about time.

Did the movie distort history?  It added a corny love story to give the film movie a time line to hang all the morbid pieces and keep it from becoming an unintereisting documentary.  No it did not distort history.

All people have the right to have a funeral.  In the funeral we tell the story of a man and a womans life.  These poor souls who were murdered at the Mountain Meadows deserve to have there story told.  This movie does this well.  And it is about time!  In the words of Teddy Roosevelt, Bully!

Why this happened, is presented from multiple perspectives. In fairness, it should be noted that Brigham Young, even though it would be hard to understand how he could not have prior knowledge of the event, was never indicted judicially or historically for the massacre. This has some significance for today, as it gives us some more insight to the fundamentalist Mormons of Eldorado, Texas who are closer in beliefs to the early Mormons, than is the LDS church itself.

The Mountain Meadows Massacre has been well documented outside the LDS Church and up until recently was spin doctored and rewritten into the dust by Mormon Apologists. It's been said well in other reviews but I'll echo it again, this movie very poignantly, dramatically and literately demonstrates the type of tragedy that can occur when fanaticism overcomes rational thought and behavior.

It's a hard film to watch but it's a valuable film to digest and think about.

That's because the zealot's blindness, denial, self-deception and irrational behavior that you see in this film is still very much alive today both inside and outside Mormonism.

Regarding the ongoing Mountain Meadows Massacre controversy, I agreed with the consensus in the Special Features Documentaries of this DVD that BOTH sides would be calmed and defused by a FULL public acknowledgment of the LDS Church's culpability as well as an apology. [NOTE: A partial concession was issued on 9/11/2007 - the 150th anniversary of the massacre. See the comment I added on 6/18/2008 for the full text] I understand that this runs counter to the LDS Church's hyper-diligence on their public image (it would damage Brigham Young's spin doctored image as the infallible voice of God for example) BUT I really think that it would quiet the tumult a bit.

I would guess the characters were largely fictional with the exception possibly of Samuelson and Young, but the context seemed historical if the story was poorly presented. The Christian characters were sappy and unrealistic.

This all seems to undermine the importance of the message - that a large group of people were mercilessly slaughtered both directly by the Mormons who settled in the Mountain Meadows area, and the Indians they'd duped into doing some of their dirty work in the name of faith. In their eyes, all the world is apostate or evil if they don't agree with Joseph Smith's teachings.

The underlying message probably missed by most - although the Mormon machine today renounces plural marriage (polygamy) because of US law, it was declared a mandate for all time and eternity for the followers of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young. How can they suddenly divorce themselves from what they claimed was a mandate from God himself? It is only one of many contradictions and deceitful practices of this dangerous cult which today uses the same kinds of underhanded tactics to thwart the efforts of Christians in Utah, short of murder (in most cases.)",1208390400,7,1433,4.864754098360656

Catholics and Mormons are always fair game by Hollywood because they don't fight back.",1207353600,14,633,4.51304347826087
3237940,1,B000XJ5TOU,"I watched September Dawn, and was quite grateful for the fast forward button on my remote. The plot is trite, the acting suspect, the research shoddy, the same flimsy stereotypes are employed. This just not a good film, it is a sloppy film.

The Mountain Meadows Massacre should have been treated with more reverance, more thought and scholarship. This movie does not answer those questions with any seriousness. It moves from clich to clich simply reimforcing the silly parodies that are decades old, and still are without merit.

Not only is this film an exploitive hatchet job, it is also a missed opportunity. Obviously the director/producer Christopher Cain was more interested in making a buck, banking that his movie become profitable because of it ""controversial"" nature. It does not even do that well.

The problem is the movie is so poorly made, it really takes a monumental effort to make it through its entire length. Go ahead, buy it, see it. I guarantee you, you'll regret it.",1206835200,15,990,4.916167664670659

The songs played in the movie is very good, and the closing song by Lee Ann Womack is one of the best songs I've heard this year. Its not played a lot but it seems to me that it should. This song is one of many songs that are up for the Oscars. If you can listen to this song, I can positively guarantee that you'll buy this song.

3237947,1,B000XJ5TOU,"As a graduate student of the American West I can comfortably say that this movie was so inaccurate I was not sure that it was suppose to be about the Mountain Meadows Massacre.  Every historian familiar with the story agrees.  This movie depicts the Fancher train coming through Mountain Meadows, meeting the Mormons, and then given permission to stay for two weeks at the site.  In reality, there was tension between the Mormons and the wagon train from the time they entered the territory due to the coming of the United States Army.  The Mormons were not trading or selling anything to passing wagon trains because the Mormons felt they needed to save all their supplies for the oncoming war.  This movie depicts the fanchers viewing the Mormons as buddies as they were camping and had permission to stay for two weeks, that is absurd.  The wagon train actually reached the meadows on September 5 and then attacked on September 7.  The movie tries to say that the massacre was a product of ""blood atonment,"" that is ridiculous.  Anyone who knows anything about statements and teachings about blood atonement in early Utah know it referred to apostate Mormons and other crimes worthy of the death penalty among Mormons themselves.  The Fancher party did not fit any of these categories nor is there any statments from those involved that said this was a case of blood atonment in order to save their souls. There was a meeting when the decision was made to massacre the train, but it was not about blood atonment nor did they begin chanting ""blood atonement, blood atonement.""  In addition the young man of the movie is woke up in the morning and his dad takes hime to recieve his Mormon Temple Endowments at the ""temple.""  There was no Temple in Utah in 1857.  The only place these ceremonies were held was in the endowment house in Salt Lake City.  They were in Cedar City about 250 miles away!  And the young man gets his endowments and returns home all in one day, how ridiculous.  Although the extent of Paiute involvment is hotly debated most authors believe the Paiutes were involved in the actual massacre to some extent which is left out in the movie.  There is also very little about the James Haslam letter sent by Brigham Young stating to let the immigrants pass without meddling with them but yet to keep on good terms with the Indians.  William Dame and Isaac Haight who were military and church leaders in southern Utah are two of the most responsible figures for the massacre and yet they are not even depicted in the film.  A movie about Mountain Meadows cannot be without these two very important leaders.

Surrounding the massacre was a lot of claims of how the Fancher train was being abusive to the Mormons, by all means most of these can easily be discounted but the point is there were tensions going on between them that not all the problems can be attributed to the Mormons alone.  By no means does anything justify the massacre but these contentions are not at all depicted in this silly movie.

The more likely motivations for the massacre is entirely missing.  That the Mormons in southern Utah snapped due to war hysteria with U.S. Army on its way to Utah is no where to be found in the film.  The other possible motivation was one of vengeance due to the fact that most all these immigrants were from Arkansas and that beloved Mormon leader Parley Pratt had been recently murdered in Arkansas.  None of these motivators is very well depicted.

There is no source for Young's quote of ""I am the voice of god, and anyone who doesn't like it will be hewn down."" Young's quote ""Now I will loose the Indians upon them! And if any miserable scoundrels come here to our Zion, cut their throats!,"" is actually two different speeches about two different issues. One on August 16, 1857 at the tabernacle where Young complains about emigrants shooting at Indians and with the Army coming Young would not hold the Indians back any longer. The other part about cutting throats has to do with the mobber's that Young believed drove the Mormons to the mountains and had nothing to with the Indians and comes from a speech in July 1855, two years before the event (see Journal of Discourses 2:311).

All those that know anything about the masscre know that this movie is way off the mark and is a fictional movie.  But even beyond that if you were to remove the historical inaccuracies the movie is simply terrible.  The acting is horrible.  The story of two people falling madly in love in two days is stupid.

The two Young Guns movies give a more accurate picture of the life of Billy the Kid than this movie gives of the Mountain Meadows Massarce and Youngs Guns didn't even claim to be historically accurate.  If you want to learn about the massacre then read ""The Mountain Meadows Massacre"" by Juanita Brooks, ""Blood of the Prophets"" by Will Bagley, and ""Massacre at Mountain Meadows"" by Ronald Walker (with two coauthors). This event is worthy of a real movie, hopefully one day someone will make a good movie about this horrible crime.

Every person that is even somewhat educated concerning the massacre does not like this movie.  Those that like it and say it is an ""eye opener"" or that it presents the ""truth"" that has been hidden are generally ignorant concerning the event and are simply unfamiliar with what happened.  A lot of these kool-aide drinkers will say they do not like my review, please before you mark that my review as unhelpful challenge me on any point in a comment of my review. Please, please, try to tell my where I am wrong and why EVERY historian familiar with the Massacre finds this movie laughable.",1201478400,35,5650,4.639558232931727
3237948,4,B000XJ5TOU,"The makers of September Dawn did not have a big budget, and are not contending for Oscars - they only wanted to tell a story from American history that most people never heard - the Mountain Meadows Massacre.  140 members of a wagon train, passing through Utah in 1857 - men, women and children - were murdered in cold blood by the Church of Jesus H. Christ of Latter Day Saints, the Mormons, under the direction of church president and territorial governor Brigham Young.

Two veteran actors turn in worthy performances - Jon Voight is righteously authoritarian as the Cedar City bishop, and Terence Stamp is an imposing Brigham Young.  Unfortunately, the screenwriting is weak, especially the dialogue in the opening scenes, but the narrative of events is what counts, and the filmmakers took great care to be historically accurate. The fictional romance is simply the vehicle to tell the story from both points of view.

The bishop's son is developing his own identity as a young man, questioning his father's ideas, and potentially serving as a peace broker, while he courts a young woman in the wagon train.  Like any rational person would, he begins to see the ""immigrant"" party as a means for his own escape from his father's cult.

The irony that this savage mass murder occurred on September 11 is not lost - at one point the Mormon prophet is quoted saying ""I will be the new Muhammad"" and the church leaders openly rationalize how they are doing ""gentiles"" a favor by killing them so they can be redeemed by Jesus.

The film also provides insight into the fear and hatred that the Mormon leaders felt towards these ""immigrants"" - they came from Missouri, where a Mormon leader was killed earlier that year.  They regarded Utah as their own Promised Land, and feared President James Buchanan was preparing to send the US Army to depose Brigham Young as territorial governor.  So the film explains the motive for the massacre without justifying it.

The ending is shocking, even if you know the story, and the message is how ruthless people can be when motivated by religious fanaticism, whether on 9/11/1857 or 9/11/2001.

The Mormon Church has undertaken a smear campaign against this film, accusing the producers of trying to undermine their presidential candidate.  The church disputes the level of involvement by Brigham Young as portrayed in the film, but they do not dispute the fact that the massacre occurred and was conducted by Mormons.

This film tells an important part of the history of ""how it was moving west.""  It is well worth your time.",1201132800,30,2564,4.824200913242009
3237949,5,B000XJ5TOU,"History is best told by the victors. History can also be re-written and re-imagined,. depending upon the bias and intentions of the writers. Such is the case with ""September Dawn"".

The Christopher Cain film tells the story of the Mountain Meadows Mormon Massacre of September 11, 1857 filling in the events of what could have happened during those fateful days of September.

With a fanatical edict, Brigham Young, ordered the strict observation of discouraging emigation through the Mormon controlled area of Utah a decade after their escape from persecution. Setting the stage for a conflict with the United states government, the moderate arm of the Church lost control to the fanatical element. Historical documents tell the story as one of lost communications between Young and the local Mormon Bishop Jacob Samuelson, while survivors tell a different version.

The film stars Jon Voight as Jacob Samuelson, Terrence Stamp as Brigham Young, Trent Ford as Jonathan Samuelson, and Tamara Hope as Emily, the love interest to Jonathan. This presentation is a passionate look at the much disputed massacre that casts a dark shadow on the Mormons of the mid 1800's.

Filmed in Alberta, ""September Dawn"", is a sweeping cinematic production that tries for the middle ground almost successfully. Injecting romance into the politically, religious struggle softens the film, yet its' inclusion makes the massacre more violent and senseless. Perhaps that is the true intent of the tale? In an entertainment environment inhabited by films more grandiose every year, subtle films packed with intelligent commentary are often lost in the mix. The intellectual debate over this event, especially at the 150th anniversary, has been rekindled.

Will history ever resolve what happened those two weeks as the wagon train rested? The point is moot almost as the consequences of the massacre still resonate in the church and throughout history. The DVD includes two special features to balance the facts and fiction.

This may not be the `truth', but if it is not, it is entertaining and presents a stark look at a dark moment in Mormon History. For the courage to present such a moment in time, Christopher Cain should be applauded.

8228432,3,B000XJ5TOU,"This is clearly an important part of US history which needs to be told, but this melodramatic movie, esp with its grafted on insipid Romeo and Juliet love story, isn't it. I for one, am sick of movies about characters with real, serious, and in this case historical, life and death problems, instead worrying about their stupid love lives. In the midst of all that, no sane person cares. This is an important topic reduced to what feels like a sappy soap opera.

And this is a spoiler, big one, but having seen this years ago in the theatre when it premiered, I still get annoyed remembering watching the Juliet literally sitting amongst the slaughtered bodies of families and fellow church members, unfazed, feeling sorry for herself that her boyfriend didn't show up?!
