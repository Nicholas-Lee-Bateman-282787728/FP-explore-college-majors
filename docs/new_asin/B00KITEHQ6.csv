8659349,5,B00KITEHQ6,"If you're into the film-making *process* this is a superb example of what wonders can be done on a limited budget with few name stars. Tautly directed by producer/co-writer Heather Hale (her first feature film), *Absolute Killers* (originally released as *Snitch*,  from a novel by Eric Troyer) features some notable performances: veteran character actor Ed Asner -- who made his film debut as a heavy opposite John Wayne --  comes full-circle as a dying crime lord, and is as far removed from lovable lug ""Lou Grant"" as one could imagine. Edward Furlong is the cynical-loser protagonist with a shot at Redemption, and legendary rocker Meat Loaf Aday, as the helpful stranger with Hidden Talents. Rick Ravanello can take justifiable delight in being The Man You Love To Hate, and Grace Johnston exudes a luminous mix of small-town grit, tough professionalism, and vulnerability as The Woman You'd Love to Fall in Love With. See this one!",1461024000,,937,5.038709677419355

8659351,5,B00KITEHQ6,"I loved this movie!  Its an exciting, suspenseful story about good, evil, faith and redemption.  Its well written and very well acted; my favorite character is Dan, portrayed superbly by Meat Loaf Aday.  Hes strong, courageous, moral, and warmhearted, and he has a sense of humor as well.  Hes the kind of person we want to be, and the kind of person we want to know.  In spite of its title, this film makes such a positive statement that I know Ill think of it and want to see it again and again.",1412640000,2,497,4.301075268817204
