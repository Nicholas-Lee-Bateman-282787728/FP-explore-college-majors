8505356,5,B006W4KVFC,"My daughter is riveted to the screen when Timmy Time comes on now!  She really does like this show.  It's different for sure, but even I like to watch it... (shh!).  This DVD set is awesome because of the pirate and treasure themes.  What kids don't like pirates?  In Timmy Finds Treasure the crew dresses up as pirates and follow a map to find treasures in the yard around the school.  They uncover a few surprises!  While they were digging in the sand, my daughter kept saying uk uck.  Haha!

In Timmy's Treasure Hunt, a goat joins the classroom.  The teacher sets up a treasure hunt using picture clues (great idea for toddlers and preschoolers who can't read written clues!) leading to a yummy basket of food.  The goat wonders off and started eating the clues!  Then in Timmy's Tractor, he makes a tractor in class, but then slowly takes it apart to give needed pieces to his friends for their projects. After what is left of his tractor gets run over, his friends get together to make him a new one.

These unspoken episodes are full of lessons and messages about friendship, problem-solving, creativity, and forgiveness.  They are very short episodes which works pretty well with short toddler attention spans!

8505357,4,B006W4KVFC,"My boys love Timmy Time because it is a different show than the typical animated cartoons they watch.  Timmy and his friends are also mischievous and fun!  In this DVD Timmy and the gang pretend to be pirates and my boys couldn't have been happier!  It is a cute show with lessons of friendship, working together, and using your imagination!",1332374400,,341,4.65
