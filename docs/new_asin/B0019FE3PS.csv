8273914,3,B0019FE3PS,"Thanks to the WWE Network, I was able to relive an event in the fourth Clash Of The Champions which was titled ""Season's Beatings.""  Now for those who don't already know, the Clash Of The Champions events were the NWA/WCW's equivalent of WWE's ""Saturday Night's Main Event/The Main Event"" where it was a big event broadcast for free on cable while in this case was to setup the upcoming Starrcade PPV a month later as Lex Luger was the special guest host of the event giving his insight into the matches & his upcoming title match against World Champion Ric Flair.

NWA United States Tag Team Championship Tournament Finals: The Fantastics vs. Ron Simmons & Eddie Gilbert - It should be noted that The Fantastics were scheduled to face the Sheepherders in this match only for Simmons & Gilbert to be reinstated into the finals when they left for WWE to become better known as the Bushwackers.  Both teams traded momentum with Simmons giving his team the superior strength advantage & Gilbert's wrestling ability keeping a slow pace while Fantastics showcased athleticism at high speeds with even Gilbert & Fulton at various points in the match having a stalemate staredown as both teams continued to work over the same body part of their opponents with various stretches & submission attempts to the point where one man had actually had ran that part of the body into the ring post on three separate occasions throughout the match as both teams gave a real competitive performance that went just seconds shy of 30 minutes.

Italian Stallion vs. Steve Williams - This was Williams first major match since joining the Varsity Club as both men went for takedowns early with Williams relying on his amateur wrestling while Stallion resorted to basic moves like a hip toss & dropkick before Williams was able to rely on his power advantage that sent Stallion to the outside more than once with it being accidental at times as well continuing to not only keep Stallion grounded but also using dirty tactics in the ring out with Kevin Sullivan on the outside.  This match accomplished what it was designed to do in showcasing the ""new"" Steve Williams under the Varsity Club with the only downfall being that the match went too long where was dry at parts to showcase this point against this level of talent.

Ivan Koloff vs. Paul Jones - Ivan Koloff had one arm tied behind his back but was able to use the rest of his body to keep getting the best of Jones to the point where Jones had to use the ringside environment & other illegal tactics to finally get the momentum & keep it in his favor as this was an entertaining match for what it was designed to be.

Dusty Rhodes vs. Animal - This match had a unique stipulation in that the winner of the match would be able to claim his opponent's (in Dusty's case, both Road Warriors) ownership of the Six Man Tag Team Championship while Dusty was looking for revenge for the Warrior's attack on him that injured his eye as Dusty went after Animal relentlessly with whatever he could use around him & attacked whoever got in his way along with allies of both men getting involved in the match too.  This was more of an angle than a match (ended by disqualification in under 2 minutes) but was non-stop chaos the entire time.

Midnight Express vs. Ric Flair & Barry Windham - This was a unique match for this time as Flair & Windham were not only the top two singles wrestlers in the company (holding the World & U.S. titles) but also the final two members of the Horsemen against not only one of the top tag teams in the company but also the team who took the tag team titles from the other two Horsemen members in Anderson & Blanchard right before they left for WWE. Flair tried to intimidate Eaton early who his ""Whoo!"" before Eaton responded by popping him in the mouth & knocking Flair down with both members of the Express eventually showing off against Flair as they had control with their counters to the double team attempts by the Horsemen. Flair & Windham did whatever they could to get the advantage & keep it from double teaming moves to their manager J.J. Dillion getting involved leading to a fight between him & Cornette. Good quality tag team match.

This was another one of those Clash's that was a mixed bag as the tag team matches where quality wrestling, the ""wrestler vs. manager"" match & Dusty/Animal were entertaining for what they were, and the big negative being the Williams/Stallion match.  In the end, it's still a Clash I would see but behind the previous three.",1416355200,,4586,4.607843137254902
