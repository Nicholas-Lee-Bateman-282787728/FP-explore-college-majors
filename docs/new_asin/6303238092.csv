An obsessive love will emerge without being corresponded will open the gates to the most relentless harassment you have seen in other stories. Fosca will be the chosen woman who will bur spark a love in flames with a Captain who has his own love affair. And this attitude of refuse will lead this drama to unthinkable labyrinths.

7842503,5,6303238092,"This is one of the truly great films--if not the greatest--about obsessive love.  Based on a short novel of the same name by Igino Tarchetti, it is one of the unsung masterpieces of Italian film.  In 19th century Italy, a strikingly handsome officer is sent far from his home town, also the site of his mistress, an extremely beautiful married woman played by Laura Antonelli.  His new quarters houses, among others, the seriously ill Fosca, the cousin of the officer's local commander in his newly appointed region.  Fosca is the antithesis of the officer's mistress; she is sick and she is, as well, supremely unattractive.
When Fosca catches sight of the officer for the first time, she is immediately smitten and her passion for him is boundless.  She implores him every way she knows how to pay attention to her, to bestow some measure of understanding and affection upon her.  The officer is repelled by her and thinks of his mistress.
Yet with Fosca's constant unrelenting efforts, something changes.  The longer the officer stays at his new command, the more he realizes it will be even longer before he is reunited with his lover.  And Fosca's attention is ever present.  The denouement and climax of this film are a marvel of emotional intensity, something unduplicated anywhere else in film.
If you have the opportunity to see and/or own this film, do not miss it.  It is truly remarkable.",1025395200,13,1400,4.84453781512605
7842504,4,6303238092,"The thought of this movie has stayed with me since I first saw it in the early l980's. In fact, I have shared its content with many friends who never saw it. What struck me the most is how the handsome cavalry officer,  once so repulsed by this hideous, obnoxious woman, came to not only see her  as beautiful, but became obsessed with her. Why do you suppose that is?  Well, it is my belief that it is hard to resist those who find us  irrestible---this is a very unusual movie and not for everyone---I like  foreign films such as this one; how many actresses in America would allow  themselves to take on the emaciated repulsive look this actress did?  can't  think of any",947030400,10,674,4.379032258064516
