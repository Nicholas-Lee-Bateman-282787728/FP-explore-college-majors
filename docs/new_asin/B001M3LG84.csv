3692088,5,B001M3LG84,"Andre Rieu ""Live In Australia"" is one of Andre's most enjoyable DVD.  You will want to watch it over and over again.  I wish I could give it many more stars.",1235865600,4,157,4.032258064516129
3692089,5,B001M3LG84,"One of Andre Rieu's best previous concert/shows was the one he did in front of The Schonbrun Castle in Vienna about 3 years ago. It is just amazing that Andre's Production Manager, Pierre Rieu, had the brillant imagination of actually building a real size replica of Schonbrunn Castle right inside the Telstra Dome stadium ,Melbourne for the venue of this concert/show in Nov 2008. It is most impressive to see the orchestra podium right on the doorsteps of the castle;the first floor ballroom of the castle right on top of the orchestra bay; two ice skating floors (one on each side of the podium); one water fountain on each side just beyond the ice skating floors. To complete the set up the somptuous chandeliers and wall appliques are as the original in Shonbrunn castle, Vienna. Four huge widescreens replace the castle windows. The rest of The Telstra Dome stadium is packed with 40 000 spectators.

After the entry of the Johann Strauss orchestra, led by Andre,and accompanied by the sound of THE SEVENTY SIX TROMBONES, the musicians and the choir build up the evening's lively and joyful atmosphere straightaway with BLAZE AWAY. By the end of this musical number a large part of the audience has already joined in the swaying mood. Andre's great talent of witty jokes and interactions with the audience start right away with the offering of the chair of the flutist Teun Ramakers from the podium to a latecomer in the audience!
FACHERPOLONAISE is interpreted with the Viennese Debutante taking to the floor of the top ballroom. After this relative short number Andre put his 1665 Stradivarius at its best in a usual fantastic interpretation of Johann Strauss' ROSES OF THE SOUTH with the Viennese Debutante group gliding on the skating floors and the Australian IJS dansers waltzing in the top floor ballroom. The choreography has improved to perfection over the past two years. The audience has started their swaying frenzy. The camera shots are outstandingly comprehensive both for the widescreens and for this DVD.

The pace quickens with The Platin Tenors' (Gary Bennett of Australia,Bela Mavrak of Hungary & Thomas Gruel of Germany) interpretation of CHIANTI SONG. Thereafter they pay a fitting tribute to late Luciano Pavarotti by interpreting Norsum Dorma- a song, among many others, that Pavarotti had used to open the world of classical music to millions.

The Imperial Ballet Group of Vienna State opera makes their entry in appropriate traditional dresses to dance with absolute perfection to an Hungarian number ELYEN A MAGYAR. After the very beautiful and joyful SPORTPALAST WALTZ there follows a fantastic, attention catching ,interpretation by Carmen Monarcha of OH MIO BABBINO CARO being conducted by Andre himself. I must add that I have seen this Brazilian soloist best in other interpretations eg.in Carmen.

The return of The Platin Tenors and the Soloists ( Mirusia Louwersa,Suzan Erens and Carmen Monarcha)in WHITE HORSE INN is probably one of the best entertaining interpretation of this opera song. The costumes are indeed most appropriate though ,I feel, the tenors should have had their pocket white hankies the same three point style as Andre's. I am pleasantly surprised to note that my favourite Suzan Erens looks fabulous after the 2-3 Kg weightloss.

The EMPERROR WALTZ is played with Sisi dancing with The Emperor Franz-Joseph and accompanied by the rest of the Vienna State Opera Ballet Group on the top floor,all in perfect choreography and appropriate costumes of that period of the 19th century- The camera shots here for this DVD are really outstanding.

After the next piece CONCERTO POUR UNE VOIX, Australian born Mirusia Lowersa gets a well deserved standing ovation with her interpretation of WISHING YOU WERE SOMEHOW HERE AGAIN from The phantom of the opera. Mirusia is introduced as the youngest opera singer to have won the world most prestigious Dame Joan Sutherland opera singers contest. She is obviously at her best sparkle playing,or rather, singing at home. Mirusia gets the audience's attention frozen during her very emotional interpretation of the Australian song BOTANY BAY before they broke up in a standing ovation at the end. Teun Ramakers,as usual, did a significant addition to the emotional element with his flute. OZIE..OZIE..OZIE....

The fabulous venue and its incredible lighting is again highlighted during the interpretation of the waltz of all waltzes THE BLUE DANUBE. The skaters  gliding on the ground floor , the waltzing couples swaying on the top floor, the waltzing couples in the audience and the dancing/waltzing fountains waters ,all add up to perhaps the most beautiful entertaining interpretation ever of this well known number. I believe that more wide angle (even bird's eyes) camera shots could create more impressive views.

Suzan Erens comes back as the young Empress Sisi in a golden carriage drawn by six white horses. What a spectacular entrance with TRUMPET VOLUNTARY! She gets in a technical mishap with her microphone but this is easily discarded in a most humourous and witty manner a la Andre. With a substituted hand held microphone she excels in I BELONG TO ME with the usual remarkable elegance.

BOLERO of Maurice Ravel, interpreted by  Marcel Falize,is perfectly accompanied by the dancing fountains water specially when 'Heaven appears to be opening up' towards the end.
At this point Andre and JSO is well poised to capture the hearts and minds of the whole audience with the lively but short interpretation of RADETZKY MARCH and brightly multicoloured balloons dropping over the audience,This is immediately followed by his medley of STRAUSS&CO (esprit joyeux etc.) that gets the  stadium carried away in the sway .

With ADVANCE AUSTRALIA FAIR and AUSTRALIAN MEDLEY he touches the heart of the Australian audience with a happy and joyful sing alongs. Andre really excels here as an interpreter of folk music and amazes his audience with his wide repertoire.

The element of surprise is a real success with the marching in down the central aisle and on to the stage of The Australian Bagpipes of The Victoria Police Force and that, while playing SCOTLAND THE BRAVE. It is a perfect prelude to the interpretation of AMAZING GRACE with Teun Ramakers flute, Andre Rieu and Manou with a bagpipe producing a real amazingly beautiful version.

The interpretion of ADIEU,MEIN KLEINER GARDEOFFICER with the presence on the stage of the Platin Tenors, the Soloists and all the dancing groups convey that the show is coming to an end. But Andre and the whole group gets back thereafter in a very lively 'Samba' with a very South American interpretation of MARINA. Thereafter he slows down the tempo with a beautiful interpretation of WALTZING MATHILDA where he gets a large part of the audience to join in a sing along & sway. The last number  ALONG THE ROAD TO GUNDAJOU by the Australian bag pipers ends a beautiful evening of music where Andre successfully brings Vienna , its music,costumes,dancers,atmosphere etc. to Melbourne.

A must have DVD in its 16:9 widescreen format and an audio option between stereo or dolby digital 5.1. The version I have is presented in English but with Dutch subtitles.
A 'grand bravo'to Andre Rieu Studios to have made the DVD available within less than one month of the actual concert/show.",1231977600,13,7325,5.080698835274543
3692090,5,B001M3LG84,"Andre Rieu and his amazing show finally made it to Australia in November 08
and the joy on 40 thousand faces was testament to Rieu's style of entertainment. It was a warm Melbourne night and the mammoth stage was spectacular,almost like being in Vienna ,a life size reproduction of the of the Schonbrunn Palace, Overall the content was similar to that of the experience in Vienna , but with a unique Australian flavour , the standout here was Mirusia singing ""Botany Bay"",to Australians this is almost like a hymn and there were few dry eyes,as the song echo's the leaving of the Old Motherland in May 1787 and reaching Botany Bay on January 19-20-1788.  There were eleven vessels which carried  about 730 convicts and 250 free settlers all starting life anew in the Unknown land of Australia.
I felt that Andre hit the mark with this,and other Australian content too, and i was also fairly happy with the sound quality given that preforming in huge stadiums of this kind can be very hard from an audio standpoint.

3692094,3,B001M3LG84,"The  performance was good as usual but a lot of repeats in selections-- I thought I had the wrong program on. I think he could do better but I suppose being in a new continent,who would know? Just not up to par!",1376956800,,211,4.023809523809524
3692095,3,B001M3LG84,This one was not as enjoyable to us as the others we have seen. He is a very accomplished violinist and a good showman. His performances show that many hours of rehearsal have gone into preparation of the programs prior to the actual performance.,1375660800,,246,4.613636363636363

3692099,3,B001M3LG84,The DVD itself is wonderful.  Andre Rieu is fantastic.  Bought this DVD to add to the collection and missed the small print of this format being unsuitable for US DVD players.  One must look very hard to find that information.  Would be nice if a posting could be noticed before purchase (without magnifying glasses).,1362873600,3,317,4.814814814814815
3692100,5,B001M3LG84,Herr Rieu and the Johann Strauss Orchestra provide an animated and fun presentation of classical music mixed with a variety or other music acts. Their live concerts are quite good too. They are in the USA this week mostly on the West Coast and Canada. If you can scoop tickets it is definitely worth it.,1362528000,,303,4.527272727272727
3692101,4,B001M3LG84,"I like Andre Rieu's fine playing, his enthusiasm, good singers, well dressed players and his natural charm.
The DVD was first class.",1357948800,,132,5.045454545454546
3692102,5,B001M3LG84,This is by far the best of Andre's live concerts that I have seen so far. I can not get enough of watching it. The color and clearity are beautiful. The music is contageous and gripping. Andre and his orchestra can take music and make it fun to watch. And make you want to go back and get more. Which is exactly what I have done. I've even gone so far as to purchase extras of this DVD to share with people that I know. And the result was just what I was expecting. They too loved it.,1350777600,,484,3.9489795918367347
3692103,5,B001M3LG84,I was so impressed by this dvd that I have been using it as a gift for friends. Mirusa Louwerse was amazing and brought me to tears several times. I also think that the great Andre himself got caught up in the emotion. He had tears rolling during the playing of Walzing Matilda at the end of the concert.,1350691200,,304,4.169491525423729
3692104,4,B001M3LG84,"I really enjoyed the music and pagentry that Andre Rieu is famous for.......sometimes I play the DVD and just listen to the music and other times sit and listen and watch the show.

3692107,5,B001M3LG84,"This dvd of Andre's trip to Melbourne in 2007 does not equal his trip to Sydney but it is another fantastic concert by this guy who has turned people on to classical music that would normally not be interested in it. Its hard to top the Sydney show where he had the most realistic bull come charging down the isle during a mexican piece of music.of course its very hard to top Dame Edna coming out at the end and thanking Andre for being her opening act.the only negative thing about the Sydney show was the cd that was produced where Andre left the Dame Edna piece completely out that was a big mistake. The Melbourne show is fantastic though, especially the Carmen Minarka number which almost had us in tears.",1332806400,2,711,4.435114503816794
3692108,1,B001M3LG84,"This DVD will not play on my DVD players. Was sent back and reordered. 2nd one was same as first. If you get some in that will work in American DVD players, let me know as I still want this DVD.",1329350400,7,194,3.7560975609756095
3692109,1,B001M3LG84,"I ordered 3 copies of the NTSC version for my mom and her friends because all live in the U.S.. All 3 received the PAL version which does not work on DVD players in this country. Customer service had a hard time comprehending the difference so it took 3 calls to get someone who understood and authorized a refund. He helped me re-order the last 2 copies of the NTSC version and was nice enough to offer free shipping. The two replacement DVDs arrived yesterday. SURPRISE !!! PAL versions again even though I was assured that this would not happen again. So now I have to send back five DVDs. I called customer service and the lady was not very knowledgeable about the different formats. After explaining it several times I asked to speak to a supervisor. After waiting for quite a while on hold the same rep came back online and said I should return the DVDs for a refund. She messed up the return label to authorize only one DVD return. Today I sent back two of them and corrected the paperwork myself. I expected that Amazon would offer some kind of a voucher for a future purchase or a free shipping on future purchases but customer service would not do that. I spent a ""significant"" amount of money on Amazon this year, about $600 just in November, and I expected much better service. Now I have to find replacement gifts for Christmas and spend a lot more on shipping.",1324339200,8,1374,4.4563492063492065
3692110,2,B001M3LG84,"It seems silly to me to ask for a review of a faulty product.
The disc received was faulty, it pixulated while running and either stopped or skipped depending on the DVD player used.

Of course I like almost all of Andre Rieu stuff.  this is probably one of his largest crowds he played for (40,000)  This is all in English expect for the songs that are written in other language and if they have singers then they sing in that lanquage.

3692118,5,B001M3LG84,I have given this dvd a 10 out of 10 as I feel the presentation is the best out of all of the Andre Rieu programs. The music selection and vocals is just great.

Even watching the DVD, you still feel that specialness of being THERE.  Living in a smaller town where there is limited music for us to enjoy, this is the perfect answer to getting our senses cleansed.

3692124,5,B001M3LG84,"I attended all three of the Melbourne concerts; this being the third. This was the best as it was filled with Rieu fans; this concert of over 38,000 people sold out in about 6 hours approx 1 year in advance. (It was originally to be the first.)
There is a real Aussie flavour to this concert. Mirusia, an Aussie, singing 'Botany Bay' and then the Aussie chant which wasn't rehearsed in the first concert and a total surprise to Andre. When she does it in this one watch the orchestra members laughing at the response she receives. Of course, for even perfectionist Andre, things go wrong. Suzan Erens when singing 'I belong to me' without her microphone working for 45 seconds at the concert, but just a few seconds here added to the enjoyment. It gave it something special as everyone expected it to be edited out.
This concert was edited and made for release in three weeks and has gone platinum 24 times in Australia. The documentary 'Andre Rieu in Australia: Andre's Aussie Adventure' was released in Australia on 6 Nov 2009 and is a great match for this. You will find it on Aussie music websites.
Definitely a DVD concert worth purchasing. 'Andre Rieu Live in Sydney' (2009 concert) will be released early December. That was great too",1257724800,,1240,4.640909090909091

3692127,5,B001M3LG84,I have several of Andre's performances and this one is the most spectacular of them all. There is a huge entertainment factor. Andre has gone from a basic orchestra show to one including several added performers and amazing backdrops. The reproduction of an Austrian castle was unbelievable. Andre always includes some local performers and traditions that get the audience deeply involved in his performance. This performance is one to see and hear. You will remember it for a long time.,1253145600,,487,5.1
3692128,5,B001M3LG84,"Andre Rieu is the showman of our generation. An ""enormous"" talent, as he so often praises his orchestra and soloists. You'll probably spend some time being astonished at the magnitude of this show. His early DVDs have the colorful performers and soft lighting on the stage, and as time progressed, Rieu has opted to ""go for it,"" dreaming up even more elaborate locations and sets. Here, he duplicated the facade of a European castle, full size, where he'd performed before. Except he added two ice rinks and a ball room dance floor. The packed football stadium could take in the full scene or move in close to the action with the large TV screens.

There is a definite shift in Rieu DVDs between the before/after use of TV screens. IN the before, you'd see enthusiastic armwaving response from the first few dozen rows only, but here, the entire stadium is enthralled.
It was fun to see the tens of thousands singing along on unfamiliar Australian songs.

The performances are always first rate, many genuinely moving, but always done with an ""even more surprises"" attitude. Many who bemoan the fall of live classical music performances...and WHAT can be done?... can only look to Andre Rieu for the right direction. His orchestra is allowed to sway with the music, to look at each other with knowing glances and winks. There's one lame joke sequence about Hungarian goulash that can be scraped, but other than that, bring on the bagpipers. LOTS of them, of course. ;-)",1252713600,2,1469,4.8023715415019765
3692129,5,B001M3LG84,"Each of Andre's performances are different.  Andre Rieu in Australia was similar
to his performance in Toronto, and other places with the castle as a backdrop.
Still, this DVD is a great addition to any AR collection.  It never ceases to amaze
me on how much energy and creativity he and his group have.  He really knows how
to involve the audience, and that's entertaining as well.  Super DVD!!!",1252540800,,396,4.695652173913044

3692136,5,B001M3LG84,"""Live in Australia"" is a feast for the eyes and ears as Andre Rieu's first DVD featuring the stunning Schonbrunn Castle set. There are new Australian numbers on this DVD, as well as less-played songs from recent shows and new arrangements of songs like ""Bolero."" Andre fearlessly includes the realities of live performance, not editing out a microphone failure on ""You Belong to Me"". Thousands of Australians filled the Telstradome for this concert, and you can see Andre's emotion as he plays ""Waltzing Matilda"" at the end of the encores.",1246838400,21,539,5.0
3692137,5,B001M3LG84,Fantastic performance by the Master. Andre continues to move the bar for the best entertainment even higher with each concert.,1244764800,15,126,5.35

3692140,5,B001M3LG84,"Of all the Andre Rieu performances that I have witnessed, going back many years on VHS through the world-wide productions on DVD, this show he gave in Australia is superlative to extremes.  I have no doubt that some will say this is not the classical Rieu, and therefore not so great, but on this occasion, he successfully presented a show that could satisfy all tastes, from those of the ""general"" public to those of the ""exclusive""  musical genre.  And that is what real entertainment is all about. I don't think maestro Rieu will beat it, but I'm quite happy to live with all his successes culminating in his great triumph in Melbourne.",1241395200,28,639,4.6875

8320356,5,B001M3LG84,"DO NOT MISS THIS ONE !!!!!!!!!!  While it is true that many DVD players in America will not play this format ( I have a cheap 6 year old CyberHome Player that does) YOU CAN STILL PLAY IT. All you have to do is take your laptop/desktop computer and run an HDMI cord from the port in your computer to the HDMI connection on your TV. If you have an older computer, and TV, with audio/video in/out jacks, just plug the yellow (video) out jack and the red and white (audio) out jack into your computer and then do the same to the In jacks on your TV. Put the DVD into your computer disk player and BAM...... sit back and enjoy the show. My 5 y/o HP laptop, and my 6 y/o HP desktop computers play ANYTHING. I am a 67 y/o grandmother, and I learned this method of play while on vacation with 2 grandkids who were bored. This DVD is one of Andre's finest and should not be missed. It is over 2 hours of  several new songs, a new stage set that is mind blowing, fun with the audience, humorous antics from the JSO, and, of course, the INCOMPARABLE gift and talent that is Andre' Rieu. Please do not be afraid to try this as Amazon will allow you a return. Also be aware that when I received my DVD copy of ""A.R Live In Australia"", it came as a bonus with his CD entitled ""Moonlight Serenade"" and is even labeled ""Moonlight Serenade"". I purchased it at Amazon for a great price, and they may still be offering the package. The CD is OUTSTANDING and worth the price alone. Just try this treasure, and I bid you, Adieu",1425168000,,1506,4.154109589041096
8320357,5,B001M3LG84,"One of Andre's best. He brought with him the debutante dancers from Vienna and a group of ice skating dancers. Much of the program was standard music you've heard on his other programs. The show moved into high gear about 2/3 of the way through the program when he moved to well-known Australian songs. Fun stuff! The audience came alive. He finished with perhaps 75-100 bagpipers and drummers. The stage was a recreation of the Shonbrunn Palace in Vienna, complete with fountains. The location was Melbourne, probably in a cricket or rugby pitch. The audience had to number 20,000 plus. You can imagine hundreds of people waltzing in the aisles.",1423353600,,646,4.881818181818182
