3765214,3,B001QIVEVE,"I hope that these upcoming volumes (1&2)of Marvel X-men are full episodes in the order that they were originally released. It would be a great series to release with all seasons. If these are random episodes just put together I would not recommend buying them! I am not sure why it is such a problem to have all the 80's & 90's Marvel cartoons released in the way they should be. On ""Amazon - United Kingdom"" they started to release all the classic Marvel cartoons with full seasons and in correct order.(But you need a dvd player that plays a PAL formated disc.)Please release these the right way or not at all!",1233532800,2,612,4.473214285714286
3765215,5,B001QIVEVE,"i watch the reruns on the jetix channel late night.  it's a coincidence that i search this on amazon.com and the DVD comes out this year.  I was unaware of when and where these episodes would be available thru.  you can count on me to buy these discs.  I used to watch this show every saturday.  the other day, my girlfriend, who never watched the show saw a clip where Cyclops was talking trash to his dad Corsair from the Starjammers and mentioned something about growing up an orphan and leaving himself and his brother Havok alone.  My girl was like, ""....wow.... this show is deep!""  I was cracking up!  they just don't make cartoons like this anymore..... stupid Pokemon!  Thanks for giving kids a smaller attention span.",1233532800,5,727,4.6171875
3765216,5,B001QIVEVE,"Fox Kids had the best TV shows ever produced, both live-action and animated. 1992 was the year when the best shows started to debut and Fox Kids was the number 1 broadcasting system. One of the most successful shows ever was X-Men the Animated Series which debuted on Fox Kids October 31, 1992. I remember watching this on Fox Kids when I was growing up.

X-Men was one of the most highly successful animated shows based on  Marvel Comics. It was one of the longest-lasting series on Fox Kids, second only to Batman the Animated Series, its most acclaimed and successful to date. Despite its final new episode airing in late 1997 after five complete seasons, Fox did not remove the show from their line-up until 1998. During its peak years (1995 and 1996), the show was often shown weekday afternoons, in addition to Saturday mornings.

X-Men also stands as the longest-running Marvel Comic based show. It lasted for 76 episodes. The second longest was Spider-Man the Animated Series which lasted 65 episodes. The show is widely considered one of the best television adaptations of a comic series ever, often being compared to Batman: The Animated Series in terms of quality. In its prime, X-Men garnered very high ratings for a Saturday morning cartoon, and received wide critical praise for its portrayal of many different storylines from the comics.

IGN rated X-Men as the 13th best animated TV show in the Top 100 Animated TV shows.

The show features an X-Men similar in look and line-up to the early 1990s X-Men drawn by Jim Lee, composed of Cyclops, Wolverine, Rogue, Storm, Beast, Gambit, Jubilee, Jean Grey, Professor X, and as well as an original character, Morph. Though they were not part of the team as featured in the animated series, the following X-Men have all guest-starred in at least one episode: Colossus, Nightcrawler, Emma Frost, Forge, Havok, Polaris, Cannonball, Banshee, Iceman, Archangel, Longshot, Dazzler, Sunfire, Psylocke, Cable, and Bishop. Keen-eyed fans may also spot cameos by other familiar mutants, such as Feral or Rictor. One prominent character, Shadowcat, did not appear in the series in any way. Other lesser knowns characters such as Blink also made cameos. Classic villains such as Magneto, Mr. Sinister, Sabertooth, Sauron, Red Dawn and Apocalypse also made appearances.

A number of famous storylines and events from the comics are loosely adapted in the series, such as the Dark Phoenix Saga, Days of Future Past, the Phalanx Covenant, and the Legacy Virus. The third episode, ""Enter Magneto,"" features a confrontation at a missile base: this is largely based on the X-Men's first battle with Magneto, as told in their 1963 debut X-Men #1. The season four episodes ""Sanctuary, Parts I & II,"" which involve Magneto creating an orbiting haven for mutants, were influenced by several storylines from the comics, chiefly the first three issues of X-Men (Volume 2) and the ""Fatal Attractions"" crossover.

Beyond faithfully recreating many of the popular characters and stories from the comic books, the series also dealt fairly openly with mature social issues. The ills of prejudice, intolerance, isolation, and racism were all frequent themes in the animated series, as they were in the comics. The series also deals with other social issues, albeit sometimes in subtext, that are not often handled by children's programming: divorce (""Proteus""), Christianity (""Nightcrawler"" & ""Bloodlines""), the Holocaust (""Enter Magneto,"" ""Deadly Reunions,"" ""Days of Future Past,"" and ""The Phalanx Covenant""), AIDS hysteria (""Time Fugitives""), and even satires of television itself (""Mojovision"" and ""Longshot""). The Friends of Humanity, a prominent anti-mutant group that appears in the second season, bears great resemblance to the Ku Klux Klan and other white-supremacy groups. Adult sexual themes are also explored: in ""Till Death Do Us Part,"" Morph shapeshifts into Rogue to attract Gambit, and in ""Whatever It Takes,"" he morphs into Jean Grey, to manipulate Wolverine's emotions. Likewise, Mystique would often shapeshift into, and flirt with, men and women.

When I heard that the this and the volume 2 DVD were going to be released, I was very excited! X-men is one of the most popular animated series and most wanted unreleased show. In fact, it is the 9nth most wanted unreleased TV show and the 2nd most-wanted animated show behind MTV's Daria. Until then,  we could only get this fantastic show on bootlegged DVDs.
But now we can finally witness this wonderful show again now that it is being released. This is a show that kids, teens and adults can enjoy. Just like Batman the Animated Series, this show is very dark, deep, emotional and very mature. If you watch shows like Pokemon, etc. you dumb yourself down but if you watch shows like X-Men, you bring yourself up.

Here's the list of episodes per disc.

Disc. 1
Night of the Sentinels parts 1 and 2:In this two-part episode, a young mutant named Jubilee is being pursued by giant mutant-hunting robots called Sentinels.

3765217,5,B001QIVEVE,"Umm...yea...title is pretty self explanatory.  I loved watching this TV show when I was a child.  After school was never the same once the show got cancelled.  Apparently, Marvel has figured a way out of the distribution rights entanglement for new media, or whatever it exactly was, that delayed the DVD release for forever and a day.  Well, I'm just glad it's finally coming out.  I heard X-Men: The Animated Series was on the top ten most wanted DVD releases.  Now I don't have to watch grainy videos of it on youtube anymore!  It's too bad the full complete seasons aren't being released (I've noticed animated TV shows often are offered in small batches of episodes first, like X-Men: Evolution or the new Fantastic Four.  Then, if popularity rises, the full seasons are released).  I'd buy X-Men: The Animated Series Complete Seasons in a heartbeat.  Food for thought, Marvel!",1233446400,4,882,4.859060402684563

3765239,5,B001QIVEVE,"I was in middle school when this came out in 92. If I remember correctly the very first broadcast was actually in the evening as part of a preview of the upcoming Fox Saturday morning cartoons. Along with the Batman and Spiderman cartoons of around the same time, this was a landmark cartoon for American television. I believe this to be the best cartoon of the 90's and maybe ever in my opinion (excluding anime). The stories are taken from the comics and are very intellectual and thoughtful for the format - no more of the pandering to young minds bull, and any moralizing that iappears is actually in the story and presented for the viewer to think about the issues himself. The constant attack on mutants by the F.O.H. is the main example. The characters are well developed - as they are in the comics and an excellent attention was paid to having the right voice actors for each character. This is a top notch production if you are an X-Men fan. In fact just about every story line presented in the live action X-Men films appears hear first (the whole collection, not just volume 1).  Buy this then buy all the others - you won't regret it. Now if only they would release the Spiderman series from the same time period in the same way. My one complaint has to do with the way Buena Vista produced this disk - there is a ton of crap at the beginning of the disk and even when you push the button to go directly to menu, you will hear your disk in the player skipping over like half a dozen things before it goes to the main menu - also each disk has like 90+ chapters on the DVD player read out which seems a bit excessive.",1484092800,5,1629,4.306188925081433
3765240,5,B001QIVEVE,"This show might not have aged well, but it's not so bad when you watch it and get into it. So many things go through your mind when you're watching this show, and the characters are pretty relatable when you get to know them a bit more. My advice; forget about the fact that this show has aged bad, and enjoy everything else.",1483142400,,325,4.174603174603175
3765241,5,B001QIVEVE,"It feels great seeing these again all these yrs later. This is about as definitive as it gets to the marvel comics. It's a true delight.

3765258,5,B001QIVEVE,"The X-Men have many incarnations.  This series was a very good one.

The 2 part pilot introduces the team - Wolverine, Professor-X, Cyclops, Storm, Gambit, Rogue, Beast, Jubilee, and Jean Grey.  They battle the sentinels, and avenge a fallen X-Man.  The following episodes introduce the various enemies of the X-Men.  Magneto, Apocalypse, Saber Tooth, Juggernaut, Mystique, Omega Red, and Sinister.

The connections between the villains and heroes is complex.  Magneto and Professor-X had once been close friends.  Though they were on different sides, they still cared about and respected each other.  Saber Tooth and Wolverine had a powerful bond.  Though they hated each other, they were much alike.  Sinister was obsessed with Jean and Cyclops.

Various episodes embody much of what was happening during the 1990's, politically and socially.  They also convey the pain of being mutants, and they joy of it as well.  How being a Mutant is simultaneously a curse and a gift.

3765332,5,B001QIVEVE,"I was 10 years old and in 5th grade when X-Men: The Animated Series first appeared on television. I had just started buying and reading X-Men and Spider-Man comics that same year, introducing me to the wonderful world and characters of Marvel Comics. When I watched the first season of this show, I was tickled pink with happiness. This was the coolest, most ""grown up"" cartoon I had ever seen! Gambit flirted with women! Cyclops and Jean Grey kissed onscreen! Wolverine played pool at a bar! I was amazed at the depth of character each of the X-men displayed. The situations were so real to me, teaching me about bigotry, loyalty, responsibility, and how to handle conflict. I was hooked to the TV every Saturday morning (and a few Friday nights when they aired ""specials"") for all five seasons, and by the time the show was cancelled, I was in high school. I grew up with this show.

Now, as a 32-year old adult who is watching this show on DVD for the first time in almost 20 years, I am reliving all the emotions and excitement that I felt as a child. The animation is a bit choppy here and there, and of course there is some campy dialogue (it was 1990's), but the show is just as enjoyable to watch now as it was back then. I am counting the days until my daughter (she is a toddler) is old enough to watch these with me, and we can have some daddy/daughter bonding time while seeing the world's greatest super hero team in action.

*WARNING*
Despite the fact that I am giving five stars for this review, I have one complaint, and it has nothing to do with the show itself. Due to the fact that these DVDs are now 5 years old, they must be sitting in a warehouse somewhere, waiting to be purchased. I bought all five volumes of the series, and three of them have the original shrink wrap stuck to the spine of the DVD case. It seems that heat has somehow melded the shrink wrap to the case itself. I don't know if this is from sitting in a hot warehouse all day, or if it is from the shrink wrap process itself, but I was unable to remove the shrink wrap portion that is stuck along the spine of the DVD case. This of course does not affect the viewing of the show.",1419811200,7,2171,4.2798053527980535

This volume has one of my favorite Wolverine quotes as well, ""How come we're supposed to trash your old enemy, but we gotta go easy on mine?""  It's refreshing to get to watch an entertaining animated show that isn't filled with mind numbing stupidity, slap stick comedy, and/or inappropriate humor.  Although this may not be ideal for very young kids due to some mean name calling (which isn't bad in my opinion) this is about as good an animated show that can be enjoyed by all ages.",1407110400,,653,4.643478260869565

3765368,5,B001QIVEVE,"I will say this, I'm very impressed by the quality of the DVD. I was expect a lot less from something so out dated. They converted the original 4x3 aspect ratio to 16x9 so it looks perfect on you new TV. Even though the show was not originally in HD the re-mastering still shows. The picture looks and sounds great for something that was released in the early 90's.

  I bought all the Volumes to get me hyped for the new X-Men movie. Since I receive my collection I've been watching non-stop. There are more episode than I remember, which is great because I don't think I had a chance to see them all when it was on TV. All the episodes are in order too, that's awesome because that was the biggest problems I had with the show when it was still on TV!

  If you're having a sense of nostalgia, I highly recommend getting this DVD. It brought back so many memories, and lets face facts, we all tried to be Wolverine while sliding three knives between our fingers as a kid. Even if you weren't around for the Animated Series but are a fan of the movies, it's good to see where the X-Men films stem from. It's also good to see what it is that's getting all the older generation so upset every time the movie go off course lol.

  To the parents out there, this show still holds up, it's not like it's in Black and White. I favored the show as a kid, and I still favor it as an adult (I consider myself a cool guy lol). I'm definitely introducing X-Men to my kids too.",1402876800,7,1466,4.170212765957447

3765371,4,B001QIVEVE,"Despite a few lame story arcs, and animation quality that isn't necessarily bad, just not great, this is still probably my favorite cartoon from the 90s. With dialog and themes much more mature than most kids shows of today, including the use of the word ""hell"" in a quote of Earnest Hemingway, and references to Nazis, which aren't things that would fly these days as far as children's programming goes.

I would have been better off never even making an account with amazon, I would have rathered buying them on dvd cheaper, or never watching them again and just save the money, I think amazon is getting me to quit watching this stuff, just the stress that comes along with it alone is to hard to deal with, looks like im canceling my account sooner then expected.",1393372800,,786,4.275167785234899

3765379,4,B001QIVEVE,"X-Men the animated series is one of those shows that not many talked about until it was off the air, which is too bad because it was well written and animated for its time. While I didn't read much Marvel on a regular basis as a kid, I understand that this show was also closer to the source material than anything that has come after it, but that information came from word of mouth.

The first volume will probably be the only one I purchase, because I felt the episodes were fairly hit and miss afterwords, or I simply wasn't interested in a specific storyline; however, I would highly recommend getting at least this one if you're an X-Men or comic book fan. The show aired on Fox when it was broadcast but somehow Disney was able to obtain rights to this show. It's a basic collection of the episodes of season one and a couple from season two, but no extras to speak of.

The entertainment value alone is worth the cost of this collection, so if you haven't seen the show yet, or just an episdoe here and there, I'd say start with this one and go from there if it suits your fancy. It is a bit corny at times, but it's an early 90s kids show; they were all like that in those days.",1389830400,,1187,4.201754385964913

This is the best ""X"" series I've seen, followed by Wolverine and the X-Men.

3765393,5,B001QIVEVE,"I know I'm in the vast minority here, but I think Marvel beats DC all the time, even animated.  I should have mentioned before this that tied with Transformers, my favorite cartoon is the Marvel Animated Universe.  I mean, with the exception of Beast Wars/Machines & the anime series, the original series was co-produced by Marvel Productions (along with G.I. Joe & Inhumanoids, 2 more of my favorite 80s cartoons) so why can't I rank them as one?  But if I had to choose between them I would pick Transformers but this is a definite second.  One thing out of the way, I combine them because I have to admit, without a really good Avengers series in the line-up, the DCAU has the advantage, so I tie it with something to make up for it.  I mean, Biker Mice From Mars was aired along with second seasons of Fantastic Four & Iron Man Animated Series as the Marvel Action Universe, so if that can be considered Marvel why can't Transformers?  Anyways, back to the review.

I remember when Pizza Hut started giving out free X-Men videos with orders.  My dad, who read some of the comics with Wolverine in them when they first came out, must have realized it would be a good video to get, at least for his kids.  I was instantly hooked.  I continued watching it on VHS & TV, as well as collecting various comics.  To this day, they are my favorite Marvel characters, & this show is the perfect representation of them.  The animation isn't as good looking as Batman, but it still looks good, especially considering this is AKOM, the company that animated some of the worst looking episodes of the original Transformers cartoon; and anyways the writing more than makes up for the animation.  It perfectly captures the atmosphere & personalities in the comics.  They are all such great characters.  Wolverine is my favorite, followed by Gambit & Rogue (they make such a great couple, & it's so sad how Rogue can't touch people) but the others are cool too (except for Jubilee, but even then she has her moments).

The synopsizes for the episodes come from Marvel Animation Age & Wikipedia.

1-2. Night of the Sentinels:  After being attacked by a group of robots known as the Sentinels, Jubilation Lee meets the X-Men, a group of super heroes aiming for peace between mutants and the rest of society.  This is a very good introduction to the series that perfectly introduces the viewer to the world of the X-Men.  A

3.  Enter Magneto:  Magneto, Professor X's old friend and new enemy, has returned and is preparing to launch nuclear missiles in order to ensure a war between mutants and humans.  This was a great introduction for Magneto, & had other good moments as well.  A

4.  Deadly Reunions:  Magneto destroys a chemical plant to draw the X-Men away from their headquarters.  While the X-Men are away, Sabretooth breaks away from his wrist bindings and captures Jubilee.  But when Wolverine discovers his nemesis holding Jubilee captive, things escalate to a feverish pitch.  The weakest episode of the volume, but it's still good.  B

5.  Captive Hearts:  Jean Grey and Cyclops are captured by the Morlocks while on a night out in the town.  Now, Storm and the rest of the X-Men must locate and rescue the two mutants before it's too late.  Pretty good.  B+

6.  Cold Vengeance:  Wolverine flees to Canada to seek solitude in the Canadian wilderness. He finds peace among a group of Baffin Island Inuit, only to discover Sabretooth has been stalking him and has taken the people of the village captive, and plans to kill them all.  The first episode that focuses on my favorite character.  It won't be the last.  A

7. Slave Island:  Using special power-preventing collars, Gambit, Storm, Jubilee and a host of other mutants are made to work as slaves in Genosha in order to complete a dam which will power a Sentinel factory.  This is a great episode, thanks in no small part to the appearance of Cable.  A

8.  The Unstoppable Juggernaut:  After the X-Men find the X-Mansion destroyed, Wolverine goes looking for the suspect, followed by Storm, Rogue and Jubilee.  While on the search, the team encounters an unstoppable villain: Juggernaut!  This is an excellent episode, simply for the special guest appearance of Colossus.  A+

9. The Cure:  A doctor at the Muir Island Mutant Research Center claims to have found a cure for the mutant gene and Rogue travels to the island in hopes of getting rid of her mutant abilities.  Rogue's part of the story is beautifully done, but there are several glaring logic breaks that should have been spotted & rewritten or written out.  A-

10.  Come the Apocalypse:  The immortal mutant Apocalypse turns mutants who journeyed to Muir Island seeking the fictitious cure into the Horsemen - Famine, Pestilence, War, and Death.  The Horsemen start destroying everything across the planet and the X-Men must battle the horsemen to prevent further suffering.  The previous episode wasn't perfect, but this one is.  A+

11-12.  Days of Future Past:  Bishop travels through time from 2055 to the present in order to stop a member of the X-Men from assassinating Senator Robert Kelly.  This is an excellent adaption of the comic story, even if it isn't entirely faithful.  A+

13.  The Final Decision:  Magneto brings Senator Kelly to a sunken ship to kill him, in hopes that a war between the mutants and humans will begin as a result.  But when the Sentinels locate the senator, they abduct him and bring him to Master Mold who has begun to initiate a plan to replace all the minds of world leaders with computer chips.  The X-Men race to stop this evil plan.  This is a perfect ending for the first season.  A+

14-15. `Till Death do us Part:  As Jean Grey and Cyclops attempt to tie the knot, Mister Sinister uses a brainwashed Morph to lay traps to destroy the X-Men one by one.  Meanwhile, Graydon Creed begins exterminating mutants in an attempt to rid humanity of all homo-superiors.  Aside from one contrived moment in each part, this was an excellent story to start the second season with.  A

16.  Whatever it Takes:  The Shadow King lures Storm home to Mt. Kilimanjaro by 'possessing' her young spiritual son Mjnari, so Rogue and Storm travel to Africa to stop the Shadow King.  The introduction of the Shadow King is a little abrupt, but it goes away after the first viewing & you see the episode for what it is, an excellent character-based episode.  A+

I love all the seasons, but I have to admit the second one is probably my favorite.  When I review Volume 2, you'll know why.",1368057600,,6527,4.674008810572687

3765415,5,B001QIVEVE,"I specifically liked volume one because it stays focused on the Xmen,and it slowly introduces other characters eventualy. Unlike volumes two,three,and four, where half of it is either about the phoenix saga, dark phoenix, journey to the savage land, or the alien shapeshifting shiar. This is why I stopped watching it regularly back in the 90's they'll have a whole episode on the Silver Samurai, but hey that's just me. I understand they incorporate alot of different characters, settings, and events etc. The xmen universe is mighty large, for instance i didn't know that Captain America made an appearance in the series (volume 5) that's one I wouldn't mind watching either. I just enjoy it a little better when they focus on the xmen themselves, rather than long drawn out episodes that end with next time on part this and part that.",1341792000,,837,4.901408450704225
3765416,5,B001QIVEVE,"I was first introduced to this series in 1994.  And it's just as fantastic as I remember it to be.  No extras on the DVDs but that doesn't matter to me.  We get all of season 1 and the first 3 episodes from season 2.  And we get all those cool X-men recaps!  For some reason, still unknown to me, I loved those when I was a kid and watching this show every weekend.  And I was buying all the vhs tapes like mad back then.  I remember raiding our Suncoast and Toysrus looking for Come The Apocalypse and Slave Island.  Good times.

  I was hooked after coming into the series during part 2 of Til Death Do Us Part.  Since I'm blind and unable to enjoy the comics, shows like this and the 90s Spider-man are my comics.  I wish Marvel would put shows like this out again instead of kiddy versions of Spider-man and that Superhero Squad Show.  Marvel?  I mean Disney.

  Anyway, some of my favorite episodes in this set are Night of The Sentinels 1 and 2,The Cure and Come The Apocalypse, and Days of Future Past 1 and 2.  I enjoy all the multi part story arcs.  But if you think about it, most of season 1 is one enormous saga.  So is season 2.

  Does anyone remember those cheap vhs tapes they would try to push on us back in the day?  You got 1 episode.  If you wanted to buy all of season 1, you had to buy all 12 volumes or you were stuck with cliffhangers.  And if I remember correctly, our parents had to pay a pretty good sized chunk of change for each volume.  So it's wonderful to have all the episodes at such an afordable price now.

3765423,5,B001QIVEVE,"The X-Men have had a variety of adaptations, ranging from the live-action movies to video games. But the best one is undeniably the 1990s cartoon, which begins with ""X-Men: Volume One"" -- it's a nonstop barrage of action, well-written characters and compelling story arcs.

A young girl named Jubilee, who has just discovered that she is a mutant, is minding her own business at a mall. Then a building-sized robot called a Sentinel smashes through the place, determined to capture her -- and she's barely rescued by a group of mutants known as the X-men.

These mutants work under the telepath Charles Xavier, trying to help protect mutants from evil humans, and humans from evil mutants.  There's a large faction of slavering mutant-haters headed by the corrupt Senator Kelley, who is helping fund the creation of the Sentinels. And on the flipside, there is the cruel Magneto, an old friend of Xavier's who sees mutants as superior and wants to dominate normal humans.

But they also have other problems to deal with over the course of these episodes -- Sabretooth, a sewer-dwelling band of mutants, a trap laid on the island paradise of Genosha, a mansion-smashing mutant, a time-traveling mutant who tells them of a horrifying future that one of them will cause, the maniacal Mr. Sinister, and an immortal mutant named Apocalypse who wants to bring about... well, the apocalypse.

""X-Men: Volume One"" is a really good introduction to this cartoon series -- it introduces all the major characters and themes in the first few episodes, and then charges off on a round of well-written, action-packed episodes. Even better: it has a moral message about prejudice and hatred that it doesn't shove down your throat... most of the time.

And even though it's a kid's show, it's very intelligently written -- strong, intense story arcs that evolve naturally, a solid array of villains, and lots of acrobatic fight scenes involving lots of explosions, giant robots and flashy superpowers. Seriously, who could want more?

But the best part is the characters. They're very rich, well-rounded and likable, particularly the sexy Cajun Gambit and the wise-cracking Southerner Storm, both of whom are fun characters with a bittersweet edge. The literate and polite Beast is a great character as well, and even enemy characters like Magneto are given a lot of depth and intelligence.

In fact, the only characters I didn't like were Jean Gray and Cyclops. She's just kind of vague and often contributes little to the story, and he's a self-righteous uptight jerk who seems to hate all other men.

""X-Men Volume One"" is sixteen episodes of solid, well-written fun, with darker undercurrents under the bright spandex and flashy powers.",1303344000,,2723,5.033333333333333

3765426,5,B001QIVEVE,"The artwork, the animation, the voice acting from most of the cast, regular or not -- everything, really -- can be really bad at times. Unfortunately, the designs of these characters just weren't really meant to be easily animated (check out the newest versions of the Marvel television series or movies to see much smoother animation, thanks in part to much more animation-friendly designs), and even as the animation quality improves, the movements of the characters still looks awkward at times. This is especially true of Beast and Wolverine, whose natural gait seems to be at half-crouch. Rogue or Storm flying can get pretty sloppy. It does take a few episodes for the voice actors to get comfortable with their roles as well.

With that being said, I'm still enjoying this volume a great deal. Originally I bought it because there hasn't been crap worth watching on television for the last few years (with a couple notable exceptions, such as Dirty Jobs), so I figured I reach back for some nostalgia and hope that meeting my childhood heroes after I've grown wouldn't be too disappointing. It hasn't been, even with the problems of this series.

The continuity, the dialogue, the growing and changing relationships of the characters, the fun adventures, the serious (and surprisingly thoughtful at times) issues brought up about equality, the gradual but noticeable improvements in animation and voice work, the epic scope of the interweaving stories in addition to the continuity, it all really works to create something that I've been enjoying as much as I did when I was watching this as a child.

With that being said, Wolverine, Rogue, Jubilee, Gambit, Beast, and Professor Xavier all grow into their characters really well. I'd argue that Rogue and Professor X were good from the start, and only goes up from there.

Previous to watching this volume, I watched the complete series of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wolverine-and-the-X-Men-The-Complete-Series/dp/B003XTUAHS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wolverine and the X-Men: The Complete Series</a>, and it's fairly on par as far as the quality of stories and continuity go. I'm getting as much entertainment out of one as I did the other, though Wolverine and the X-men certainly had better production value.

It's hard to say if you'll enjoy this or not, though. If you've got the $20-something this costs laying around not doing anything and are looking for good classic animation, maybe something to put alongside your Time's The Real Ghostbuster's collection and Ninja Turtles volumes, give it a shot. If you're too used to newer animation and require smooth, digitally colored, great-looking animation to go along with the great stories, you really may just want to skip this. Check out Wolverine and the X-men instead, as they're just about the same price. However, I felt it was $20 that were very well spent.",1293840000,,2925,5.26824034334764

Everything in the show just keeps getting better as time goes by and most of the source material is from the comics (alot of which were written by Chris Claremont).  For me, I always love how they can respin some of those classic yarns into a new age with a new X-Men team and still make it enjoyable. (sometimes more enjoyable than the original version)

This first set does not have any special features so don't get too excited.  Disney didn't want to spare any expense in case these didn't sell well.  But they have and one would hope that Disney will learn from this and give some more attention to the Marvel Universe because if they treat the fans right, they will be rewarded ($$$$).

3765432,4,B001QIVEVE,"In the 1990s there were two awesome action cartoons. One was Batman The Animated Series and the other was X-MEN. Both went on to spawn other TV shows around their respected comic universes and while DC until this day still has the upper edge X-MEN still stood the test of time and it has finally come to DVD!

The X-MEN show gave us the most popular X-MEN of the time and threw a few guest appearances in every now and again. The stories were loosely based on the stories in the comic and the animation was dead on in regards to the characters themselves. The show was fun, full of action and paid true homage to the X-MEN universe as a whole.  One of the major pluses about this show was the animation. I loved how they didn't change the style of the costume on any of the characters, even though some of them who were in fact X-MEN in the comics and not in the show still had the `X' badge on their clothes. I guess it was a message to the fans who never read the comics to go out and read them. Still, unlike Bruce Timms DCAU there were a few imperfections on the Marvel end of the spectrum. One was the fact that it was a little too kiddie. I mean take Wolverine for example...he is a character that is gritty and dark, yet being a kids show there were times that they just made him far too goofy with his jokes. While the voice acting on him was good again it was just far too child oriented. Still, when you are 9 years old it's something that you have no issues with, fast forward through time about 2 decades and there are lines in there that make me cringe. However, within this shows 4 year run there were some very deep episode that really touched on the backgrounds of all the characters. There were in fact a select few that were extremly emotional and that was how some chapters in the X-MEN world have been throughout time. Also while I was never able to catch any future episodes past the Dark Phoenix Saga I read up and saw that a lot of these episodes in the last 3 season were show out of order. The DVD releases could have fixed that but putting them all in the right order, but they didn't. Not that the episodes were bad or anything, but continuity does intend to work. I remember there was an episode that is on the final 5th DVD set which should have been in the beginning of the 3rd set because of the plot.

In summation I am very glad that this show is on DVD. I own it and love it. I am very glad that they decided to finally bring one of the best TV shows of my time to DVD so I could finally enjoy it in its entirety.

3765443,4,B001QIVEVE,"I have to say that I had my reasons for starting my collection.

My ""episodic"" reasons: ""Night of the Sentinels"" (1 & 2) and ""'Til Death Do Us Part 1 & 2) (actually the start of Season 2 but part of Season 1s DVD).

Characters: Well, Rogue has always held a special place in my heart but, on a more serious note, I've always considered Gambit an awesome character in his own right due to a cross between his power and his personality and I'm only sorry that he was underused post-Season 2 and I've always liked Morph for the personality (that distinguishable laugh being a large part of his personality) along with the hero/villain dynamic.

Other than that, I have to say that I rarely watched the series in its first airings, so this was my first time seeing a lot of classic episodes. I'm only glad that I gave this show a second chance because I love it. ""Enter Magneto"" and ""Deadly Reunions"" (Magneto and Sabertooth's debut stories and interconnected to the first several episodes) were actually very good and I'm sorry that I missed them before.

Anyway, ""X-Men"" goes a lot deeper than a lot of Saturday Morning cartoons did then or do now. It tapped so much into messages about acceptance and delved deep into the harshest parts of human prejudice. As early as the second episode, the team dealt with the deah of a teammate! For those who remember the series, the magic is all still there. For those of us who overlooked this Marvel gem in our youth, it's definitely worth a first look.",1273449600,,1493,4.518518518518518

The voice actors were well cast and the animations were amazing.  I enjoy watching the show now, as much as I did when I was a kid.

The DVDs come in a nice case with some great artwork.  The episodes translate well to DVD format.  There are no special features but, in my experience, that's to be expected with Marvel releases.

The current DVD releases are pale in comparison to the original cartoon.  The art and animation were far from the best. It was a landmark because Marvel was getting it's act together and making the characters work.  Wolverine, in this version at least, is far better than the subsequent ones in the other series.

3765456,5,B001QIVEVE,"In an alternate world where humans are living among mutant beings and are hated among the normal people. Mutants are beings with extraordinary powers or looks that makes them different and are sometimes hunted down, yet an extraordinary mutant man named Professor Charles Xavier rounds up good mutants from across the country and other nations to train them as ""X-Men"" which are a group of superheroes with unique powers such as Wolverine for instance who is a Canadian mutant with an adamantium skeleton/claws that could break through anything and he could heal up instantly and never age like we do. Jubilee who has the power to blow stuff up, Storm who is an African mutant with the power to control the weather, Beast who lives up to his name is a furry beast-like mutant with superhuman strength and intelligence. Jean Grey who is a beauty with the exact powers just like Professor X on telepathy/telekinesis, Gambit who is a Canjun mutant with the powers to make cards and objects into explosive bombs with a touch, Rogue is a southern belle mutant who can fly and has both superhuman strength and can absorb other people's powers/lifeforces temporary by touching them. Cyclops has the ability to shoot lasers through his eyes but must wear a special pair of goggles or sunglasses to block his unstoppable laser-eyes and finally Professor X who is the teacher/creator of the ""School for the Gift"" is also the leader of the group as his powers consists of telepathy/telekinsis as he struggles to fight for mutant rights and peace between good mutants/humans alike but unfortunately his former friend Magento bands up some terrorist mutants to destroy mankind while the X-Men with Professor X uses their powers for good to help mankind.

A brilliant animated adaptation of the Marvel comics is truly an outstanding animated show with intelligent writing, emotion and action galore. I love the animation to this show and how faithful to the classic Marvel comics it is even to the roots of the comic series, the show went on to win a daytime award for best animated series and has created more X-Men fans since then yet even hardcore X-Men fans were satisfied with this series. It became the highest rated saturday morning show on FOX appealing to people of all ages including adults not just kids or X-Men fanatics, the show is the definition for 90's animation much like Batman, Superman or Animaniacs had.

This DVD has the first season starting with the 2-part ""Night of the Sentinels"" showing a teen mutant runaway named Jubilee is founded by the X-Men after being attacked by a large robot called a Sentinel and becomes a member of the X-Men soon. ""Enter Magneto"" has Beast imprisoned after destroying mutant files at a mutant registration agency as Xavier's enemy/friend Magneto introduces himself and wants to spread his hate among the human race, ""Deadly Reunions"" has Magneto with Xavier reunited including Wolverine and old time foe Sabretooth. Next ""Cold Vengence"" has Wolverine seeking a better life in the arctic while Jubielle with Gambit and Storm have a mission/vacation on a special island that accepts mutants that they soon discover is a tourist trap, ""Slave Island"" continues off the last episode has the three mutants enslaved with other mutants for they must try to find a way out of the hell-hole of a place. ""The Unstoppable Juggernaut"" has a very large and powerful man named Juggernaut robbing banks and destroyed the mansion as another powerful mutant named Colossus has been framed of those crimes yet the X-Men must prove his innocence, followed by ""The Cure"" where a professor has a cure for mutant powers yet Rogue wants that cure badly so she can touch another person but she will soon discover that the place isn't what's cracked up to be, ""Come The Apocalypse"" has a powerful evil mutant named Apocalypse creates his own four horseman for now the X-Men must stop his reign of evil. ""Days of the Future 1 & 2"" is a 2-parter that is very ""Terminator""-esque story about a futuristic mutant named Bishop who is sent back in time to stop an assassin from happening so he could change the future, ""The Final Decision"" has senator Kelly kidnapped by Magneto then rescued by the Sentinels only to find out that the master of Sentinels has plans on global dominion for they must be destroyed and that a peace treaty between mutants and humans might co-exist. ""Till Death Do Us Part 1 and 2"" is a 2-part episode where Cyclops and Jean Grey get hitched while a former X-man named Morph comes back with a vengence with the help of a new friend named Mr. Sinister as there's still some anti-mutant groups but sort of a modern KKK where they hunt mutants instead of other human races. And finally ""Whatever It Takes"" has an evil being that arrived from an Astral plane in Africa to take over the body of a young mutant boy for now Storm with Rouge must repossess him and try to send the creature back to the plane as Xavier and Magneto discover an uncharted land as Wolverine searches for Morph.

The message that X-Men brings is still is dire need of being heard today, over 10 years later. Equality and an unbiased world is what we should be striving for, even if it seems hopeless.

3765470,4,B001QIVEVE,"When I was in kindergarten I taped every episode of X-MEN when it came on Fox on Saturday mornings.  It became my favorite show, even though I'd never read the comics.

After a couple years I kind of lost track of what was happening on the show.  It's been quite a while since I watched the series, but a handful of story arcs have stuck out in my memory.  To my delight, all of these highlights were included in the 2-disc Volume 1 collection:

""Night of the Sentinels"" and ""Enter Magneto"", the first (and introductory) episodes; ""The Cure"", where mutants journey to Muir Island in hopes of being made ""normal""; ""Come the Apocalypse"", the follow-up where Apocalypse and his four horsemen try to destroy the world; and ""Days of Future Past"", with Bishop going back in time to prevent an assassination.  This volume also contains the episodes where Mr. Sinister ruins Cyclops' and Jean's wedding, a story I remember only vaguely from my fuzzy VHS tapes.  So, for me, this set is almost all I need and it'll keep me happy for the time being.

The DVD itself is a little disappointing, but not surprisingly so.  The two discs contain only the episodes, with no special features whatsoever.  But it's the episodes that are important, so...

X-MEN is '90s-tastic.  There's no mistaking when this series aired.  It looks dated, but that just adds to the nostalgia factor.  The animation isn't anything special, but I think most people would watch the show for the action-packed storytelling.

This DVD is primarily for nostalgia buffs and comic book fans.  Older viewers who are new to the series likely won't enjoy it as much as those of us with so many childhood memories tied to it.  But I think the show might be okay for kids, if they're young enough not to be distracted by its dated look.  (God knows little boys like superheroes.)

...X-Men TAS is a wonderful show. The series had interesting storylines, intriguing characters, exceptional heroes, and the villains we've learned to hate and love! Back in the early 90's, a simpler time of course, there were X-Men. This animated series was a milestone and became a must watch TV show every Saturday morning.

I am a huge comic book fan and don't understand why fans of comic books never have the luxury of seeing their favorite characters hit the big screen or the little screen more often. So, when i found out X-Men was going to be on Fox, i knew it would be one of the best shows ever, and it was. Yes, the animation is not top notch, but its still great underneath the surface.

A few reviews have complained that the DVD release could benefit from a re-mastered cosmetic upgrade. I wonder if that would truly make a difference. Regardless, i enjoyed this series thoroughly. A must own for any sci-fi comic book lover!",1242691200,,973,4.711764705882353

The presentation however is very mediocre. Bad dvd layout, retarded menus, gets stuck on certain dvd players. There's no commentaries or anything like that. I was expecting to see something like Matt Groening did on the Simpson's first season boxset.
Luckily it has a spanish audio track (I grew up in Mexico so I watched it dubbed in spanish), the only reason why I don't buy other series is because they don't have spanish audio included

3765475,4,B001QIVEVE,"Hi there! I have waited and waited many long years to finally have this X-Men cartoon on DVD. I never could figure out why it was taking them so long. I knew that many loved this cartoon, as did I, so it just didn't make sense to me why there was no DVD collection of it. Well, I went out and bought it on the day it was released and I have to say that the cartoon is just as amazing as I remembered! The characters, the story, even the corny jokes that are cracked are all awesome! I did, however, have a few gripes with how this great cartoon is represented on this DVD.

1. As others have said, there are no special features at all. I'm not usually a special features kind of guy, but this was one of my favorite cartoons back in the day, and seeing as it took them so long to release it on DVD, they had plenty of time to dig up some features for it. But no, there is nothing. Total laziness on their part.

2. I was so excited as I popped in the DVD for the first time. Then came the first annoyance to dampen my excitement. The RIDICULOUS amount of previews that are shown before the main title! I mean I have never seen this many previews before on a DVD in my life. Preview after preview of movies I don't care anything about. Of course, you can hit the skip button, but be prepared to hit the skip button, wait a second for next preview to start, hit skip button again, wait another second, and repeat for about 8-10 times. It is simply unbelievable. I let out a big sigh of relief when I finally saw the main menu, which I was beginning to think didn't exist.

3. So I went on to select the option to play all of the episodes. It starts with the beloved intro and music, goes into the cartoon, and the credits. No problem there. I watched about four episodes before I had to turn it off and go do something (a friend had called). I came back to pick up where I had left off, starting with episode 5. It played, no big deal. Then it went back to the main menu! I don't want to have to keep selecting the next episode from the main menu every time. Why doesn't it just play the episode after it like it does when you play all episodes? I don't always want to start from the first episode. Maybe I want to start from the middle. Well, if you do, be prepared to navigate the main menu a lot to select the next episode.

Although it seems I ranted more about this DVDs cons than I talked good about it, I really am happy to have it and I definitely recommend buying it. I just think it's good for the buyer to know these things. It is a wonderful cartoon and not much can be said that hasn't been said by me and other reviewers.

If you're a fan of the X-Men movies and newer X-Men stuff, then go and buy this and see more about the characters you love, along with characters you may not know much about like Gambit, Jubilee, and many others. If you're an old X-Men fan, then buy this too. Hell, if you even vaguely enjoy superhero stories and cartoons, then buy this. It's great and it's not just simply Wolverine slashing or Cyclops blasting. It deals with real world issues like racism and prejudice. I can watch it and be able to compare it to real world events many times. It has serious dealings with real world issues, action, some comedy thrown in, and the episodes all tie in with each other (at least with the first few seasons), so what more could you ask for?",1242000000,2,3376,4.124620060790273
3765476,3,B001QIVEVE,"It's with great conflict that I picked up both of these ""sets"" recently.  The X-Men cartoon was my favorite as a kid, somehow topping the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Ghostbusters for me.  As you can imagine, there's a great deal of nostalgia for me where this product is concerned.  If I didn't love the cartoon so much as a kid, my review would likely be poor, or even harsh, but I do so it's not.

The cartoon itself was unique for its time.  The characters freely spoke of life and death and the show had a very mature theme to it despite being a superhero cartoon.  I remember it was classified by Fox as a ""Superhero Action Drama"" which fits well.  A lot of episodes deal primarily with character conflict, with a bit of action thrown in at the end.  The action scenes are usually basic, but were standard fare for the time.  The animation quality was also pretty standard.  The show usually looks great when little is happening, but gets clunky when a lot is moving.  There are frequent miss-colored parts or errors throughout but you learn to deal.  And even though there are numerous fights between hero and villain the violence is always kept in check.  This first season was slightly more graphic as some blood pops up here and there but it is never over the top.  One character dies but it occurs off screen.  When Wolverine engages an enemy he never actually connects with his claws (unless the enemy is a robot or something) and bullets do not exists (everything is an ""energy weapon"").

Still, the show remains engaging and for children it stresses the importance of civil rights.  For adults, the dialogue can contain cliches and the serious tones of the episodes can feel ""dumbed down"" to get their message across.  Part of that is due to the show dealing with layered plot lines that need to be wrapped up in 22 minutes, so the pacing can be off.  For children, it's not really noticeable.  If I had never seen the show I'd like to think if my kid started watching this program I wouldn't mind being in the same room and watching it with him (which is tough to say for a lot of children's shows).  Despite its serious tone, the show does make attempts at humor with Wolverine and Gambit both providing a lot of one-liners.  Some of it is corny, and some of it is genuinely amusing.

For what it is, a children's cartoon about the X-Men, it really is pretty wonderful and if I were rating the show alone I'd be inclined to award a 5 star rating.  Especially for the first season (though this DVD set contains the first 3 episodes of season 2 as well) as the show was presented in an ongoing format, with each episode flowing into the next.  This format would be loosely carried over into season 2 before the show went for a mini series approach with interspersed one-offs.  The first season always wasn't as Wolverine heavy as some of the later ones, there are a couple of episodes where his role is reduced to little more than a cameo which is a nice break.  All of the characters are pretty interesting in their right and each one gets some time to shine.  For long time fans of the X-Men, some of the episodes are a bit odd as no one is familiar with Magneto in episode three even though he'll be shown in flashbacks in later seasons battling a younger team of mutants.  The character Angel also apparently never was in the X-Men when he shows up in a later episode and cameo characters Cable and Bishop both wear X-Men logos on their uniforms, even though neither considers himself affiliated (or even aware of) with the team.  These errors may be an annoying for some, though truthfully they do not detract from the experience.  This probably is the best overall season for the show though, and anyone who saw it as a kid remembers ""Night of the Sentinels Part 2.""  The two-part ""Days of Future Past,"" ""'Till Death Do Us Part"" and ""The Final Decision"" are also personal favorites of mine.

The DVD's though are pretty poor.  I do like the original artwork for both sets but inside the cases is nothing but an add and two discs.  On the discs, there's only trailers and the actual episodes.  There are foreign language dubs and subtitles, so if that is a concern for you know that they're there, but otherwise that is all.  There are no commentary tracks, no developer interviews, no roundtable discussions, nothing.  It's quite a shame and really just laziness on the part of Disney to not give this release the treatment it deserved.  I have an old VHS tape of this show that at least had a writer roundtable before the feature (containing Stan Lee, Claremont, and some others) that they could have at least dug up and thrown on here.  The only positive I can give this release is at least it's not too pricey.  The retail on it is about 25 dollars but I haven't seen it marked for higher than $17.99 anywhere and on Amazon you can get both releases for a little over $30 if you buy them together.

For me, the bottom line is what matters most and that is the episodes.  I've wanted them on DVD for awhile and I'm glad to finally have them so I am willing to purchase these.  I have enjoyed reliving this series and I hope the rest of it gets released.  I know artwork for the third volume was leaked but no official release has been announced.  I'm also hoping any fourth volume will be the final rather than a short fifth volume and that volumes 3 and 4 are released together like 1 and 2 have been.  It would be a real shame if X-Men suffers the same fate as some of the other Disney owned properties and only receive a partial release as there are some really great episodes in later seasons (Dark Phoenix, Beyond Good and Evil, Courage, etc).  I'm not holding my breath for a re-release either that contains the missing special features and I recommend others do the same.  I can remember as a kid paying $10 for a VHS of ""Till Death Do Us Part Part II"" so being able to get an entire season is like a dream come true.  If you want the show, pick this up.",1241827200,6,5987,4.4129443938012765

3765479,4,B001QIVEVE,"I will not spend any time elaborating on the importance of this pivotal superhero animated series since anyone visiting this page undoubtedly knows that already.  However, since many DVD sets have been issued in edited form over the years, I felt it necessary to alleviate any concerns of the same being true of this release.  The episodes on this set clock in at around 21mins 30secs each, which is the correct full length. A handful of early episodes had incomplete animation that was only seen in the original airing and corrected by the original animation studio ever since, which is what are on these discs.  For instance, the original airing of ""Slave Island, Part 3"" ended with the X-Men arriving at an intact X-Mansion instead of one demolished by the Juggernaut.  Due to animation delays/ problems with ""The Unstoppable Juggernaut"" episode (which was to follow chronologically), the ending was altered, since the Juggernaut episode would not be ready to air for several weeks.  So ""The Cure"" and ""Come The Apocalypse"", which were ready to be aired, were shown first instead.  Fortunately, these episodes are arranged by production order and not broadcast order, thus the chronology of the storylines are not disjointed.

This series is one of the few where having the original broadcast versions is not better.  So many of those early episodes aired initially with incomplete special effects shots, coloring mistakes, dialogue sync errors, poorly animated scenes, and so forth.  The two-part pilot episodes in particular have several variations due to repeated corrections and alterations (FOX initially aired unfinished, error-ridden versions of the pilot episodes as part of a 'sneak preview').  While such issues were eventually corrected and finalized in subsequent airings, the fear has remained that a studio releasing this series on DVD would issue the flawed original versions.  Luckily, Disney seems to have done their homework with this release even though the series was not treated to a full video and audio restoration job or extras (thus, a star deduction).  Further proof that these are not the syndicated versions - this set features the original voices of Storm and Sinister, which were re-dubbed by the replacement voice actors in reruns.  BOTTOM LINE: Disney has issued the corrected versions of certain episodes that originally aired with animation errors and NOT the edited for time syndicated reruns.",1241222400,68,2431,5.234536082474227
3765480,5,B001QIVEVE,"In 1992, it was a special year for X-Men fans.  Popular artist Jim Lee would bring new life into the X-Men comic books by giving them new costumes, bringing an edge to the way the characters were drawn and a new comic book spinoff in the X-Men universe.

With the popularity of DC's Batman: The Animated Series on FOX KIDS, it was time for Marvel to step up to the plate and when the announcement of a new X-Men animated series was announced, fans were ecstatic.

Adding to the excitement was the news that the series would be utilizing the characters as seen on the Jim Lee comic books and popular characters such as Gambit, Rogue and even newer junior member Jubilee would be featured.

Despite using the same costumes and is adapted from the comic books, there are some differences from the comic book series to the actual origins of the characters and also an original character named Morph who was added to the team.  But despite the differences, the series was still accepted by fans due to the series including action sequences and its utilization of many characters from the comic book series.

The series proved to be a big ratings hit for FOX KIDS and lasted for five seasons (1992-1997) and on April 28th, Disney has released two volumes containing two DVD's.  The first volume which contains the first 16 episodes and the second volume which contains episodes 17-33.

In Volume 1, the DVD's contain the ""NIGHT OF THE SENTINELS"" episodes including ""Days of Future Past"" and ""Til Death Do Us Part"".  Here is a summary of episodes included (each episode is 21 minutes long):

DISC: 1

  * EPISODE 1 - NIGHT OF THE SENTINELS (PART 1) - Due to the violence by mutants such as Sabretooth against humans, the government is forcing mutants to register themselves to the agency.

  * EPISODE 4 - DEADLY REUNIONS - With Sabretooth being nursed back to health, Professor X confronts his friend/rival Magneto.  Meanwhile, Wolverine and Sabretooth battle against each other.
  * EPISODE 5 - CAPTIVE HEARTS - Scott Summers and Jean Grey try to help a mutant and end up in the underground tunnels with the Morlocks (mutants not accepted by human society due to their characteristics).  The leader Callisto wants Scott Summers to be her husband and holds Jean Grey captive.  Meanwhile, we see Wolverine getting closer to Jean Grey.
  * EPISODE 6 - COLD VENGEANCE - Because Logan's conflicted feelings towards Jean Grey, Logan (Wolverine) leaves to the snowy north where Sabretooth awaits him.  The two get into another battle with each other.

  * EPISODE 12 - DAYS OF FUTURE PAST (PART 2) - Bishop tells Professor X and the X-Men of how mutants in the future are blamed for the murder of the President and thus an army of Sentinels were created to seek all mutants and hunting them down.

  * EPISODE 16 - WHATEVER IT TAKES - Wolverine goes after Morph, while Storm becomes possessed by the Shadow King.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""X-MEN"" the animated series is presented in full screen (1:33:1).  One thing that you will notice is that the animation does show its age.  Since the animation was created over 17-years ago, a lot of the animation is hand drawn and compared to many of the digital animated series that are show on television today, the animation doesn't have that digital color vibrancy as newer animations.  But like many older animations from the 80's and the 90's, especially for superhero-based storylines, the strength lies within the storytelling.

At that time, the animation was quite exciting for any of us who were fans of the comic book series but watching it today, you realize that the series does show its age.

As for audio, audio is presented in Dolby Digital Surround Sound and is dialogue-driven.  I wasn't expecting any 5.1 surround sound but audio dialogue is heard quite clearly.  If anything, I have to say that the English dubwork was very good for the series.  From Wolverine's scruffy voice, Rogue's southern accent and Remy Lebeau's Louisiana/French style of talking, I've always felt that the ""X-Men"" was well-cast for the animated series.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are no official special features in relation to the X-MEN animated series but trailers for newer releases from Disney.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I was among the big X-Men fans who were highly anticipating the series and just loved it!  As a collector of the X-Men comic books around that time period, to have a series based on Jim Lee's character designs and a series with so much potential of showcasing a variety of enemies and characters, it was always a treat to find out who would be introduced in each episode.

In fact, during the hoopla and way before the Internet became part of our natural lives, many of the fans would communicate about the episodes through electronic BBS's and show our happiness and excitement over the animated series, the action figure line and of course the many multiple X-Men related comic book series that flourished from the early 90's.

For volume 1, these 16-episodes are quite solid.  Not only do you get the sentinels hunting down the mutants but you have Sabretooth, Magneto and his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants such as the Blob, Pyro, Avalanche and then you get other baddies such as Apocalypse, Mystique, Shadow King and more.

Also another big step that was a nod to the comic book series and surprising to see in a Saturday morning cartoon were the episodes featuring Logan (Wolverine) showing his feelings towards Jean Grey and for that to be included in the actual cartoon.  That was absolutely surprising but nevertheless, as a fan, you couldn't help but be happy that despite the cartoon being shown on Saturday morning television (where cartoons are typically aimed at young children), the series managed to keep those romantic and edgy moments from the comic books and adapt those stories to the animated series and thus winning the attention of the older fans.

Overall, ""X-MEN VOLUME 1' is a solid set and with a total of 16-episodes, this long awaited series has finally come out on DVD!  For fans of the ""X-MEN"" animated series, you can't go wrong with this release.",1241136000,2,9220,4.665632754342432
3765481,5,B001QIVEVE,"I can understand some of the gripes about it lacking any video/audio enhancements and lack of special features but for those interested in content- It's a good buy.  It's a must for any X-Men fan, whether it's of the comics or the movies.  The great thing about this show is that it appeals to kids, adults and those in between.  It's great to watch it when you're older and (for example) you finally realize what some of the things Gambit said to Rogue really meant.

  Some aspects of it might be dated but it will appeal to kids of this generation because the stories and voice acting were great. It wasn't as censored (like Spiderman) and it was as true to the comic books as possible;  Especially the Dark Phoenix Saga in Season 3, which was almost quoted word for word. It's sad that they don't have special features but any X-Men fan should support it.  I just got the dvds today and for those who are looking at the page and haven't read the other reviews, they fixed some of the annoying animation errors during the first run and they're unedited. I read that it even features Storm's original voice (i'm going to find out right now).  I'm especially excited that 'Days of The Future Past' is on it, considering that they refuse to show it on tv.

 Long story short, you can't go wrong.",1241049600,,1295,4.444915254237288
3765482,1,B001QIVEVE,"As most every fan out there, I have been waiting YEARS for this amazing series to be released in full on DVD, not an episode here and there, but full seasons. Well it's finally been released! Well don't get too excited now like I did, you're in for a BIG disappointment. Although these are the episodes, in correct order, they are EDITED AND CUT! These are NOT the full length original airing of the episodes. These are more like the re-run versions. Just like The Simpsons, the re-run episodes on TV are cut for time length from the original episodes. I guess the ""new episode"" airing time for shows have less commercial time, I do not not. What I know is this, just like when watching other shows on ABC Family, TBS, even FOX and etc, the original airing of each new show has MORE than the re-run version. This brand new DVD set is just like watching the re-runs on TV. So if you simply want (as I did) the 1990s version of the X-Men, go ahead and buy both of these volumes; but if you're looking for the full length 24-26 minute unedited, uncut versions...keep waiting. Maybe one day, SOMEONE will produce this wonderful series the RIGHT WAY!",1240963200,22,1145,4.457142857142857
3765483,5,B001QIVEVE,"This was one of those cartoons I made it a point to wake up early every Saturday morning to watch when I was a kid and now as an adult, I enjoy them just as much but can appreciate it even more. This was a very mature cartoon for its time but not so much that kids couldn't enjoy it. Like its comic book origin, it explores themes you just did not expect from a cartoon of its time. I consider this, Gargoyles, and Batman: The Animated Series to be the culmination of American-style t.v. animation of its time before western animation took a heavy turn towards anime-styled series (not that it was a bad thing, but it did change things). There was something about the chemistry of these characters (maybe because of the voice actors or the writing or what, I'm not sure) that just clicked much better to me than the later X-Men series like Evolution and new, but still good, Wolverine and the X-Men.

I hope that everyone interested will buy this. Disney is releasing it and they're somewhat notorious for not finishing series on dvd if they don't sell ""well enough"" (such was the fate of Gargoyles). This is a series that deserves to have a full release.",1240963200,3,1155,4.44811320754717

3765485,3,B001QIVEVE,"I agree that, while it is really awesome to finally have this amazing cartoon on DVD after what seems like a 1000 years, it should have been done right. Disney had ample time to clean up and remaster this cartoon. Just look, for example at what they were able to do for the release of their other classics like Pinnochio and such. Those movies are decades old compared to X-Men that was out only some 15 years ago. Disney/ Buena Vista should know better than this. At the same time I am very happy to finally have these and even though I prefer a cleaner version it still looks and holds a type of nostalgic quality for me. 3 out of 5.",1240963200,16,635,4.213114754098361

But I never did I just can't pay for someones home made copy. Well this is kinda how I feel right now. Like I paid for someones home made copies.
Maybe my standards are a bit too high or I just expected more after such a long wait. But if you have these episodes taped off the TV on a VHS you have the same picture quality right here on this DVD set without the commercials and channel icons in the bottom corner.
This picture quality is that of cable TV not even standard DVD quality. The sound is very basic. Simply put this is a bare bones set of the 1st 16 episodes with no effort gone into increasing picture or sound quality. Special features consist of blue ray advertisements that look horrible and don't do blu ray justice.

If you have the original (from the 80s)Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on DVD from lions gate its the same picture quality as this xmen set to give you an idea.

But what can I say its a classic and I had to have it!! For over all quality its no more then a ""good rating"". For nostalgic purposes its through the roof!

3765487,1,B001QIVEVE,"The one star rating isn't for this amazing 90's series itself, it is for Disney/Buena Vista for their handling of such a possibly lucrative product. This DVD release is about 6 years past due, and judging by the quality of it and lack of special features I can't see what took them so long to get it released, maybe they were waiting for a deal on DVD-RW's, I'm not entirely sure. Either way, this is a bare bones terrible transfer of a beloved series. After years of online petitioning and e-mails the fans are given this sad excuse for a DVD collection.

The discs contain 8 episodes, yes, 8, thats right, 8! And its not like the saved room on the disc is utilized in a reasonable fashion like a high transfer, stunning special features, commentary, character gallery, or even a post 1990 DVD menu. This DVD release is like buying a burnt copy of the series online or at a convention, however the only difference is those releases at least have an excuse for looking terrible, Buena Vista has no excuse. I am sure that in 4 years there will be a decent release of this awesome series. However, with that said avoid this release at all costs and send a message to Disney/Buena Vista that this low-quality bare bones slap in the face to fans everywhere just won't cut it. By the way, Buena Vista is also holding Spider-Man from the 90's captive as well, which I'm sure when Spider-Man 4 hits theatres will get this same terrible release. Buena Vista should take a page out of Warner Home video in their release/treatment of Batman the Animated Series.

3765488,5,B001QIVEVE,"Just got it today after oh so many years of waiting, and figured I'd let other buyers know what to expect.

The episodes haven't been cleaned up... there's only so much that can be done to enhance a 1990's animated series.  But at least there aren't commerical cut-offs, lost footage, or tv station watermarks on the screen, like there are on countless bootleg copies of the series.

The DVDs (this one, and volume 2) are bare-bones; no commentary, no special features, no booklet.  Just a simple standard DVD case that holds 2 DVDs that are silver and gray, with no artwork on them.  Basic menus with very little artwork adorning them.

My guess is after releasing all 70+ episodes of the series, there will be a deluxe boxed set with commentary, features, additional artwork, etc. (this is usually the case with tv shows, especially cartoons).  But for 20 bucks or less for each set, the lack of anything special doesn't take away from the fact that both X-MEN volumes are a STEAL.

As for the content.... the show is still just as awesome as I remember it.  Yes, it's dated, and the dialogue can be corny at times, but back when I was a kid, Jim Lee's run on X-Men was the coolest thing on earth, and if you loved Lee's take on the characters, you'll love these sets.

3765490,5,B001QIVEVE,"Undoubtedly the best animated series to ever bear Marvel's banner, X-Men is finally here on DVD, and its release has been long overdue.  Watching it now the show is a little dated, and even somewhat corny, but this 90's animated take on the X-Men remains the best justice that Marvel's merry mutants have ever gotten.  Taking Chris Claremont and Jim Lee's time on the title as main inspiration in terms of character style and team lineup, as the series begins with young mutant Jubilee being rescued by the team as she's on the run from the mutant hunting Sentinels.  There's stoic leader Cyclops, his love Jean Grey, charming thief Gambit, the brilliant Beast, high flying Storm, the powerful Rogue, the shapeshifting Morph, and some bub named Wolverine.  They end up tangling with nefarious foes like Magneto, Apocalypse, Mr. Sinister, Sabretooth, Mystique, Juggernaut, Graydon Creed, the Morlocks, and more besides; all the while the rest of the world hates and fears them all for being mutants.  There's also plenty of guest appearances from other X-Men icons that didn't make the cut of the team for the animated series, including Colossus, Bishop, Cable, and Angel.  Throughout the course of these two discs (which contain the entire first season run and a few episodes from the second), the X-Men animated series is definitely the most faithful in terms of staying true to its comic roots, which is something to be admired in itself considering much of the convoluted X-Men mythology, and also echoes the overarching themes of isolation and prejudice that always set X-Men apart from the pack to begin with.  The voice acting remains wonderful, and though the animation hasn't necessarily aged too well, it's still good to look at.  All in all, the 90's X-Men animated series is finally here on DVD, and if you have fond memories of it from growing up, you should definitely pick up both volumes of the show, and let's hope that the remaining ones don't take forever to get released.",1240617600,2,1990,4.919402985074627
3765491,3,B001QIVEVE,"I've watched this show recently, and it doesn't really feel like anything great. It's got plenty of corny bits (""Got bit by a dog, too.""), and the quality, to me, hasn't really held up like that other great '90's cartoon (Batman: TAS, for those of you that dunno what I'm talking about). The show feels stale, and not fresh, but it's worth a nostalgia dip. Kids today probably won't really care about this as much, with the modern Wolverine cartoon being out (why it's Wolverine and the X-Men, I don't know, because every X-cartoon out there stars good ol' Sniktbub). It was cool to see Mr. Sinister and many of the X-Men done in something at last, but for me, the older ""Kitty Pryde and the X-Men"" pilot is far better in terms of animation and story.

Sorry but I am happy to see them finally get something beyond a few episode releases!

With this, you are actually getting at least 3-5 more episodes!

While I obviously don't have these volumes, I have seen these episodes and that's what my ratings is based on. While the series as a whole was great, you are actually getting the best of the series, which was the first 3-4 years it was on in my opinion. Here is what you'll get:

VOLUME 1 - DISC 1
Night of the Sentinels (Parts 1 & 2) - In this pilot two parter, we meet Jubilee. A foster child who is discovered to be a mutant by her forster family and is on the run from the government. The X-Men discover her as well and come to her aid but not without a cost that will have long-term effects through the entire series. We also get the first taste of The Sentinels.

Enter Magneto - Professor Xavier's former friend/now enemy returns to start a war between mutants and humans. Meanwhile Sabretooth is taken in by the X-Men, must to the dismay of Wolverine!

Deadly Reunions - Both Wolverine and Prof. X must face off with their respective enemies Magneto and Sabretooth with the lives of their fellow X-Men at stake.

Captive Hearts - The Morlocks make their first appearance as Storm fights for the freedom of Cyclops. Meanwhile, a love triangle develops between Cyclops, Wolverine and Jean Grey.

Cold Vengeance - Angered by jealousy towards Cyclops over his relationship with Jean, Wolverine goes to the frozen north to relax but runs into Sabretooth! Meanwhile, Gambit, Storm and Jubilee go undercover as tourists to check out the island of Genoshia and find more than they bargin for!

Slave Island - Captured by the rogue agency that run the Sentinels, Gambit pretents to betray both Storm and Jubilee in order free them. The mysterious mutant known as Cable also makes an appearance.

The Unstoppable Juggernaut - When a rash of robberies is committed by someone big and powerful, the russian mutant known as Colossus is blamed but it is Prof. X's step-brother Juggernaut! The X-Men come to Colossus' aid and helps to clear him.

Disc 2
The Cure - We meet Warren Worthington, III for the first time as he seeks a cure for his mutancy. A cure that X-Man Rogue wants desperately!

Come The Apocalypse - Apocalypse unleashes his Four Horsemen for the first time as they and the X-Men clash. Meanwhile, Rogue uncovers the truth about the ""cure.""

Days Of Future Past (Parts 1 & 2) - In this one, Bishop travels back into time to stop the assassination of mutant hater Sen. Robert Kelly, believing it would prevent much of the damage done in his time. He also believes that one of the X-Men (his heroes) is that assassin! We also see the first signs of a budding romance between Rogue and Gambit (the latter who Bishop thinks is the assassin)!

The Final Decision - Sen. Robert Kelly is initially kidnapped by Magneto but is rescued by the Sentinels only to discover that their leader Master Mold has his own plans for Kelly and all the leaders of the world! Now, the X-Men and Magneto must put their philosophies aside to battle this mutant hunting army to the death!

Till Death Do Us Part (Parts 1 & 2) - Believing they are married, Cyclops and Jean Grey go on a honeymoon, not knowing they have been set up by Morph. A former X-Man now bent on revenge by a shadowy figure known as Mr. Sinister! As a side angle, both Prof. X and Magneto have been set up to go to The Savage Land by this same villian, believing the other was in danger! Furthermore, they discover that they no longer have their mutant powers (though as a side effect, Xavier has regained the use of his legs).

Whatever It Takes - Storm, along with Rogue, returns to Africa to save her godson from The Shadow King. Meanwhile, we catch up with Prof. X and Magneto fighting for survival without their mutant powers!

This is what's on this volume! While I don't know if there is any extras or stuff like that, I have seen these episodes and they are excellent! Recommended for sure!",1237852800,2,4218,4.52299605781866

3765501,5,B001QIVEVE,"Is it just me or was television overall, but especially children's, better in the nineties? Growing up we had such intelligent children's programs introducing us properly to mature themes of adulthood, Batman: the Animated Series, Spiderman (the 90's version that often crossed over with X-men), and X-Men itself among many more.
Even Disney had more mature shows back then with the likes of Gargoyles on the air (which I'm upset they never finished releasing on DVD) and children's shows with well done premises like Recess. Nickelodeon had it's greats back then too (Rugrats, Doug, Rocko's Modern Life, etc.), now all they have are Dan Schneider productions and Spongebob.
Animated sitcoms/series were smart and edgey not stupid and in your face trying to get shocks, we had the likes of King Of The Hill, Daria and Simpsons at its peak.
Now all kids have are Ben 10 and an onslaught of angularly drawn super hero revamps (which are sometimes enjoyable but not nearly of the same calabur), along with the recent Disney sitcoms that have become so wrongly popular amongst the youth. I wish I could go back to the nineties, luckily this set will help me and anyone else longing to do that by allowing us to revisit these classic episodes.

16 Whatever It Takes

I can't wait to watch Volume 2, which is also announced, because it has the Pheonix Saga which I remember so vividly still today. It's amazing to me how true to source material and how few liberties comic book based animated series took back then.

There are no special features on this set and though I'd obviously love special features I'm willing to be happy with just the episodes if that's all they'll give us for now. I'm one of the people who hopes that good sales on these volumes will lead to the release of the others and possible special features in the future. I also hope that good sales on these sets could lead to the release of Marvel's 90's Spider-man series in sets like this.

Having now found the time to watch the DVD I want to say for those wondering that the video quality is near the same as I remember the original broadcast being. Any transfer issues are near unnoticeable to me and I am fairly particular about not being distracted by technical issues while watching my DVD. Obviously the animation quality is from the early nineties but really I find it on fairly on par with the new Wolverine and the X-men series. I found watching the episodes very nostalgic and find myself enjoying them in a whole new way now than I did when I was younger. I'm happy to see that the ""Previously on X-men"" openings are kept on the episodes and that the opening sequence and classic theme play before every episode unlike some other sets.

I also want to add that the box art is even better looking on the actual set than it is online. It comes with a cardboard slipcover over the DVD with an elevated foil colored version of the artwork on the DVD. At least Disney really made these look professional in the packaging department.

For those still wondering whether this set is worth it I say buy at least the first volume to test it out, it's really only costing you a little more than a dollar an episode. Anyways, here's hoping they'll finish releasing this whole series. I still remember the final episode where Xavier leaves the X-men truly on their own. 5 stars for this DVD despite the lack of special features and it's definitely a 5 stars series.",1234396800,198,3799,4.538686131386862
3765502,5,B001QIVEVE,"i think this will be the greatesr dvd release in history. i watched this everyday after school and on saturday morning cartoons along with eek the cat, and life with louie. ive actually had the xmen series for 3 years now off dvdsontv.com. it cost about 40 bucks for burnt ones. there are alot more episodes on those? but i will be purchasing these cuz of the case. i also think  that should be xmen 1&2 on blu-ray since that put the third",1234310400,2,439,4.289156626506024
3765503,3,B001QIVEVE,"Okay, there's absolutely no reason why this series shouldn't have been released EONS ago! Let's face it, the only reason this collection is FINALLY coming to light is so Disney could ride 20th Century Fox's coattails. If you check the date of this product's release (and the character that's prominently featured on both box covers), you'll see it coincides with theatrical release of ""X-MEN Origins: Wolverine"" on May 1st. Could they be anymore obvious?

Since Disney took so damn long, many people resorted to buying bootleg collections online or just transferring the material they recorded/bought on VHS to DVD. The only incentives to purchasing this collection is 1) If you don't already own the complete series and/or 2) If it has tons of bonus features: Interviews with the voice actors, commercial spots, a series bible, collectable box art...the works! Otherwise, you're better off just downloading it from a torrent site or something. After such a loooong wait, I think the fans deserve those extras. I mean, this series ranks #9 among the most requested TV shows in history (animated or live-action) to be put on DVD. Obviously there's been a market out there for some time.

However, judging from Disney's past releases with shows like Ducktales, I wouldn't expect anything special from this other than the episodes themselves. These days, Disney is just a money-making machine without any regard to the FAITHFUL fans of the projects they release. If this series went through Time Life, it would be a totally different story. If you purchased ""the Real Ghostbusters"" collection last year, you know exactly what I mean. It's undoutedly THE BEST animated series collection EVER to be released! Superior packaging, cast interviews, TONS of bonus materials, it's a very thorough collection that covered the Real Ghostbusters from every angle imaginable. They took into account what THE FANS wanted & that's the RESPECT quality-driven shows of the 80's & 90's should be warranted.",1234310400,4,1987,5.167701863354037

3765506,4,B001QIVEVE,".... Is that this series is owned by Disney.
I've read reviews from fans of tv aired Disney cartoons that were released on dvd (Talespin, Ducktales, Rescue Rangers, and the Muppet Show <yes, owned by Disney>), and there are dissapointed fans all across the board about those releases.  ""No special features"", all releases were ""missing first 4-5 episodes that established the characters"", ""sound and visual not cleaned up"", ""episodes not in order"".  Common complaints from purists, yes.  Though vastly, most reviewers did enjoy the releases and rated them highly.
Just realize when a release says ""volume"", it in NO way entails episodes to be in order.  I don't understand how people can keep assuming volumes to be ""complete season""s.  Only then, would the episodes be in order.
I know this is a long awaited release.  But don't expect too much from Disney on this.  I agree with the purists that Disney seriously lacks consideration and quality when it comes to -finally- releasing these great shows for the fans.  Just makin' a buck.  I'm sure I'll buy these volumes especially.  But with all the valid complaints in mind, -I-, won't be dissapointed after I get to view this long awaited release.  And hopefully I've helped customers to have an open mind about this one, given Disney's history.",1233705600,7,1297,4.958333333333333

However, the transfer and quality of the image on this DVD is HORRIBLE and a DISGRACE. It's like watching a VHS transferred onto DVD. It wasn't until I purchased a bootleg version on Blu Ray, where the creator upgraded and cleaned up the quality to 1080p, frame by frame, did I realize how much we are being screwed by Disney and Buena Bista for this collection. The Blu Ray Bootleg I have is AMAZING! It felt like I was watching the show for the first time, noticing facial expressions and details for the first time, even though I have seen this show hundreds of times. The colors and sharpness of image were way better on the blu ray bootleg than this garbage, even though there is still significant motion blur when the characters move fast and poor definition for when characters are in very wide shots. However, this is a fault of the animation of the time and not the actual transfer. So in short, we are being screwed by Buena Vista and there is a fan transfer on Blu Ray that just made me throw these stupid DVD's into the garbage!
