223755,5,6300181626,"""The World of Martial Arts"" to this day is a wonderful legacy to the instruction of Grandmaster Al Thomas and founding of the Budojujutsu system. This wonderful video/laserdisc [depending on the format you've purchased] is a showcase of the logical aspects to the art that Sensei Thomas created. This video features cameos by Chuck Norris [giving a glowing recommendation] and ""Judo"" Gene Labell as a thug in the opening scenario. Sensei Thomas enlists the help of several of his past students and aquaintences. The list reads like a who's who of martial arts: Steve Sanders [Kenpo Legend and founder of the BKF [Black Karate Federation], Karen Shepard [Al Dacascos' Won hop Kuen do Blackbelt and national tournament champ-see her as of late as ""The Enforcer"" on the ""Hercules"" TV series]Gracias Casillas [Hwarangdo Black belt/Kali-escrima instructor and women's boxing/kickboxing champ-now Jujitsu Black Belt and married to Ernie Boggs]Benny ""the Jet"" Urquidez [former WKA/PKA bantamweight champ,movie actor (""Force Five"")fight choeographer (""Gross Point Blank"")and founder of the The Jet Center] among several others. These martial artists feature the aspects of Ukemi [breakfalls],Blocking, striking, locks and throws/chokes [featuring Hayard Nishioka-juso champ and author of ""Foot Throws""]. It is a wonderfully produced product that is a welcome addition to any martial artist instructional archives. The only personal disappointment is that David German, the inheiritor of GM Thomas's art, was not featured in the video at that time. But, this splendid video will stand the test of time as a memorial to the late great Al Thomas.",1004227200,4,1635,5.51792828685259
7804867,5,6300181626,"Good ""Promotional"" video.  The stars involved are all highly rated artists.  Al Thomas was a great representative of the Martial Arts.  He taught many artists who either were already great in their own art, or who went on to become masters or founders of their own system, such as the great late Grand Master David German, who founded the T.A.I. (Transition Actions Incorporated) system.  These artists then went on to teach many others, now into the third and fourth generation of practitioners.  A great legacy!  All who knew him vouched for his skills, intellect, and personable character. Grand Master Thomas is sorely missed.",1505952000,,630,5.067961165048544
7804868,2,6300181626,Eh; just words. It would be nice to see a more realistic sparring; everything is just in slow motion when they're sparring; that's not gonna cut it in real life situation.,1493251200,,171,4.548387096774194

7804871,3,6300181626,Not a bad movie but no detail just words. When they talked about the Balisong Knives they didn't show any details at all about the history.,1461801600,,139,4.384615384615385
7804872,3,6300181626,Interesting video. I am currently taking modern arnis so it was neat to see some masters and grand masters discussing their philosophy. Some dialogue was difficult to understand due to the heavy accents so subtitles or and interpreter would have helped.,1461024000,,253,5.195121951219512

7804874,5,6300181626,"This is a good documentary on the Filipino Martial Arts. This is not a how to video. The cover and name of the video is misleading.
It has various interviews some of the popular styles of Kali, Arnis, Eskrima, masters in the Philippines. I've been doing the Filipino martial arts for 25 years and I find this DVD informative. Available to watch for free as a prime member!",1452211200,,372,4.485294117647059
