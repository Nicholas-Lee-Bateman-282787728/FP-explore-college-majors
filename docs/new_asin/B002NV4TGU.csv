3960254,5,B002NV4TGU,"Was Christmas present for friend who loves old Western TV shows and movies. Every time I see her, she raves about how wonderful they all are. Some series are shown on memorabilia type stations, but most, she hadn't seen in years. When asked, she says the quality of the recordings are excellent, and says it, along with the other one, Ultimate TV Westerns that I got her are the best Christmas present she's ever gotten.",1421020800,,420,4.613333333333333

8375476,5,B002NV4TGU,"Western TV Treasures from MILL CREEK DVD. Where to start? -  At the price here on Amazon.com you can't really go wrong. Over 60 hours! 150 episodes! More than I can ever watch in my lifetime. The pros...The aforementioned number of episodes. The rarity of some of the series (to me in the U/K) - ""Cowboy G-Men/Dusty's Trail/Gabby Hayes Show/Hudson's Bay/Judge Roy Bean/Night Rider/Law of the Lash"" and more. Many of my favourites all together in one bundle (""Range Rider/Annie Oakley/and more""). It's called Value for Money. The Cons...No one should expect mint condition transfers (elsewhere someone refers to the quality as ""Excellent""...they aren't! But most are perfectly watchable tho the sound can be variable, but what I have seen so far are a bit between fair only and quite good, and frankly I didn't expect much more and so far I am pleased overall with the watchability. Some series are a disapointment ""Law of the Lash"" is very poor in all departments, but a must for the western fan as are the ""Gabby Hayes"" shows (Gabby introing and then excerpts from a feature film all in 25 mins.) I hope I have written enough to help in any decision making. Well worth a chance. If you love TV westerns of the 50's I don't think you will regret buying even if,as I do, you already have many shows already (Range Rider/Annie O/Buffalo B jnr"" among others). Get the DVD for the rarities.",1508803200,,1386,4.703703703703703
