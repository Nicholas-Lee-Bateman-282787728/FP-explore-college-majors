8393982,5,B003BV8HWI,I watched the first season on tv. they didn't advertise the second season like they did the first one. so i didn't know they made a second one. But over all I really like the series.,1400457600,,182,4.083333333333333
8393983,4,B003BV8HWI,"I like the second season, it is a little bit short! And not in german.
And the first season is better.",1394150400,,102,3.9047619047619047
8393984,3,B003BV8HWI,"This season is not as good as the first season but I still bought it because I wanted the entire series. I wish they would have had the show go on because I really enjoyed watching the show but this season is not as good as the first. You could live without having to buy this one - the only important season is the 1st, in my opinion.",1363219200,,335,3.9411764705882355
8393985,5,B003BV8HWI,I absolutely love this series. I personally loved season two but I was a part of the few who did unfortunately.,1361404800,,111,4.333333333333333
8393986,2,B003BV8HWI,"I will have to agree with some of you. As this show started (1st season) I was addicted. It was my favorite show, and I'd never miss an episode. I loved the old characters, and how it was more 'dramatic'. This 2nd season is alright, but definitely nothing like the first. As said before, majority of the characters who made the show worth it, are gone. The new ones aren't as interesting. The show has gotten rather boring, but nonetheless, I was sad to see it go. I was hoping they'd spice it up some more, and bring it back!",1294012800,2,526,4.27
8393987,4,B003BV8HWI,"The first season of this show was incredible. One of the best hour long dramas I have ever experienced.  The second season lacks as they made it more ""family friendly"" & they lost some of the cast. Luckily the extremely talented Charity Shea continues her role as Sam(antha) Best. Also, Degrassi fans get a nice bonus as Lauren Collins (Paige Michalchuk on Degrassi) guests for four episodes. This second season isn't bad at all, it just lacks compared to the brilliant first season, but I am very thankful we got these additional eight episodes to get some sort of wrap up on the series. The bonus features are around 30 minutes of interviews & around 8 minutes of b-roll footage.",1291680000,3,681,4.675
8393988,2,B003BV8HWI,"The first season was soooo amazing! It was my favorite show and I couldn't wait for the second season. But it took over a year for it to come out and when it did it was awful! The characters acted like they weren't even them, the show became really stupid. Too bad, because the first season was awesome.",1286928000,4,303,4.241379310344827
