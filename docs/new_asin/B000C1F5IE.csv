8519476,5,B000C1F5IE,"The DVD package makes fun of the ""cult classic"" moniker, but for me and a bunch of people I know, it *is* cult material! From the collection of characters to the funny ""commercials"" to the brilliant (and hilarious) dubbing of the 10 episodes of ""Trail of the Royal Mounted"" (aka 1931's ""The Mystery Trooper""... re-released to an unsuspecting public on the silver screen under the new name in 1935, and then aired on TV in 1949). I notice something new every time I watch it!

The basic premise of the show is just bizarre from the get-go. The host of the show disappears only minutes into the first episode (for the rest of the season!) and an unlikely replacement host is corralled (pun intended) into taking over by the puppet sidekick. The remainder of the season tries to carry on the ""cowboy"" show (and doing a very poor job at remaining a ""cowboy"" show) while trying to discover what happened to the original host. No spoilers, but the whole thing is a surrealist masterpiece from start to finish! Despite it's seeming chaos, as the season progresses, so many of the wild speculations of the increasingly demented investigator turn out to be true, and the season wraps itself up in a nice weird little package (and ready for season two! ... the show ran for three and a half seasons).

I saw this show as it was airing on television for the first time (over a decade ago at least) on a two bit local television station in Ontario, Canada. It was obviously the work of a bunch of people who were trying to do their best with an absurdly low budget but a lot of great (and ""so lame it's great"") ideas. I can't help but think that the TV station had only produced the show to fill in some sort of local programming requirement or something, but they got a lot more than they could have imagined. I've often wondered if any of the station's management ever actually watched the show... somehow I can't imagine that they did or the people making it never would have gotten away with half of what they did!

I am so happy this show is finally coming out on DVD!!! I've had nothing to watch but my dubs of dubbed video tapes that I got from a friend and they're starting to wear out from use. I'm sure I've watched the whole show over half a dozen times (all of the seasons!). I've thrown the show on for kids when they're over and I've thrown the show on for my adult friends (albeit, only my weird adult friends). It has never failed to entertain and, for adults, somewhat disturb.

Watch the season all the way through (although I wouldn't recommend trying it in one sitting without securely fastening your mind-belt!), then go back and watch it again. A real low-budget classic!",1133740800,5,2681,4.487704918032787
8519477,3,B000C1F5IE,"Every once in a long while, you'll stumble across a TV show while channel surfing, and with one single glance at the screen, you're spellbound, and asking yourself, ""What the heck is this?""  ""Cowboy Who?"" is one of those TV shows.  Part hallucination, part labor of love, it is, at the same time, like nothing you've ever seen, and exactly like the sort of low-budget local children's television programming that every city has hidden away somewhere on the dial.

""Cowboy Who?"" is a perfect parody of low-budget children's television largely because it is a low-budget children's television show itself.  It is either art imitating life imitating art, or it's life imitating art imitating life, but either way, you'll find yourself laughing in disbelief at its courage and quirkiness, and thinking to yourself, ""What the heck is this?""

 The added benefit of having all 12 episodes in a single DVD collection is that you get to follow the intriguing mystery of the disappearance of Cowboy Pat, the program's original host who disappears in the first episode.  As well, you can follow the adventures of ""Trail of the Royal Mounted"", an old black & white western serial with an installment of its continuing story in each episode of ""Cowboy Who?""  This is a luxury that Saturday morning TV watchers had to do without until now.  ""Trail of the Royal Mounted"" also happens to be one of the most clever and seamless examples of re-voicing old footage that you're ever going to see.

  What the heck is ""Cowboy Who?""  It's as anarchistic as the Marx Brothers, as psychedelic as ""Pee Wee's Playhouse"" and as innocent as ""Winnie the Pooh,"" and produced on a shoestring by some very clever and creative folks who appear to have broken into some second rate TV studio somewhere in Ottawa.  Its pace, simplicity and trance-inducing special effects have been known to hypnotize young and old alike.  Do not watch it while operating heavy machinery.",1133222400,4,1936,4.895705521472393
