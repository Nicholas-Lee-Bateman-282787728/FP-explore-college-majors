8610369,2,B00EYO251U,"What is being shown here is quite explicit, that's the good point. HOWEVER: There are many bad points that annoy me. First: Runtime is said to be 60 minutes. Alright, it sums up to 60 minutes, but what you really get is just about 25 to 30 minutes worth of of real footage. The remainder is dull repetition, sometimes done in slow-motion and sometimes in form of a ridiculous mirror-image. The latter disturbed me. When a scene of 2 minutes or so is over, the exact footage of the 2 minutes is being repeated as a mirrored image. Whose crazy idea was that ? But it still gets crazier: The most idiotic thing - absolutely incomprehensible to me - is that the picture is periodically fading to white, veeery slowly, every minute or so. This superfluous optical effect takes away much of the relaxing effect of the film. Just when you start to feel comfortable with a scene, the picture gets whiter and whiter, until it's all white. My advice for further productions would be: no optical effects, neither mirror-image nor fades to white. Lighting of this film is not so good either. The skin of the model is often reflecting the light in a strange way, so that the skin at times appears to have a green hue or a red hue. It's as if the camera people didn't know how to do their job properly. This shows also in the many ridiculous camera angles. Sometimes the camera even hinders the viewer to pay attention to what's going on. That's when the camera is directed at the sky or at the trees or when the camera is shooting from ground level upwards (like in Citizen Kane), so that you get a sight, seen from a frog's point of view, of the side of the table where the model lies upon. Great. Imagine the same camera crew being hired to film a chess play. They would film anything else but the chessboard, I guess. The editing of the background music is very choppy. Just another proof of the overall clumsiness of this product. It's such a pity because the model and the massage being performed are good. They deserved a better filming than this. Conclusion: If you expect something like a Hegre production, forget it. It's way below Hegre standards. However: If you know this and have no high expectations, this film can be considered worth watching all the same.",1493424000,,2258,4.509756097560976

Only reason I didn't give this a full 5 stars is because I didn't find Alli to be quite as enchanting as Claire. Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying Alli was a bad choice. It's just that I didn't find Alli to be quite as attractive as the other girls. Didn't quite pan out to be as awe-inspiring as how she appeared on the blu-ray disc label.",1429401600,,454,4.416666666666667
8610371,4,B00EYO251U,"The model Alli is very beautiful and sexy!! I would call it time well spent! She has a beautiful body and her face is cute. I would recommend this video to all. So what it is only soft core? The video was done tastefully and with attention to Alli's assets! She is an incredible model and I'm looking forward to seeing her other videos!! Bottom line, expect a nice artful soft core tease and you won't be disappointed!! 4 stars out of 5. I recommend this video. I love Alli!!",1418515200,,475,4.288888888888889
