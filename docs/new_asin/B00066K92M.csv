It doesn't matter that I can't speak German, for their melodies are familiar, and beautiful.  Also, the German words are highlighted as the music is sung, which is interesting.
It's short, the singers are not shown, and there isn't much to see, but the DVD is well worth having, for the music alone.",1133049600,2,440,4.407407407407407
