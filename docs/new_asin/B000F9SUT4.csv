2555385,1,B000F9SUT4,"What a dreadful ""rip-off"" this ""historical"" set is.  While the selections are vast, the copies are sooooo shoddy, the colors soooo shifted and shifting, that whatever was exciting about these flixs of my childhood has disappeared totally.  As far as ""Digitally Remastered"" is concerned--false--they just set the worst 16mm prints in a Telecine and let them run.  No color correction, no light/darkness adjustment, and, certainly, no removal of cuts, bleeps, dirt, scratches, etc., etc, etc.  I'm seed my set off to ""Badwill"".

I had always wondered about those movies as a small child and thought ""hey that would be a cool movie!"" never knowing this was an actual genre until years later. Now Mill Creek has put together a nice collection (seemingly all sourced from VHS but if you want dvd quality sourced from a print youll get about 2 of the movies for the price you pay for this whole collection), and I feel like others the less than spectacular sources for these flicks just adds to the cheesiness.

I did find a few that I found that made it worth it, but remember, these movies have not been restored in any way and so when they say it is a color movie, you can turn your TV color function all the way up and you'll still hardly see any color.  I understand that if they restored all these movies that they would run $10 each, but there are so many movies being made that are very much better than the old ones, so why spend the time and energy.",1461110400,,693,4.0510948905109485

2555453,5,B000F9SUT4,"First off, I was a huge fan of the peplum fim genre as a boy. Steve Reeves was and is among my lifelong heroes and role models. I have purchased several other collections of thse films, but Warriors is by far the best. It's chockablock with Hercules, (The Mighty) Sons of Hercules, Samson, Ursus, Goliath, Maciste, and other heroic and ancient names played by Steve Reeves, Gordon Scott, Gordon Mitchell, Ed Fury, Reg Park, et al. These movies were never intended to be Oscar material, so I won't even address that. They are - for the most part - decent transfers of rollicking good adventure stories providing 74 hours amd 24 minutes of entertainment.
  The real surprise comes with movies in the collection such as 1962's Damon and Pythias featuring Guy Williams between his television roles on Zorro and Lost in Space. This movie is a true classic tale about honour and friendship rather a mindless sword and sandal matinee diversion. Romulus and the Sabines (1961) is not only a tale of Rome's founding written with true wit, but the viewer gets the treat of seeing a pre-007 (even pre-Saint) Roger Moore as Romulus.
  Even if you don't gauge Warriors' worth on a movie-by-movie basis, the collection works out to less than a quarter per movie if purchased through Amazon. Stop complaining and start enjoying!",1438646400,6,1313,4.822222222222222

Washed out colors, scratches and blurry images, watermarks and bad dubbing, just how I remembered these ""classics"".  You either like these types of films or you don't, no in-betweens.  I think these films are for the pre-CGI crowd where imagination is required.  The life of the sword and sandal craze was short, late 50's to mid-late 60's, and this collection has most of them.  If you look at these films through nostalgiac rose tinted sun-glasses there is a good time to be had.  A great value for the volume.",1404345600,2,602,4.632075471698113

2555506,5,B000F9SUT4,"great way to have a wide variety of a genre that was once the rage. Dialogue and soundtrack surprisingly well written in some cases. Traditional elements of mythology thrown in haphazardly but amusingly. Hearkens back to a simpler time in choreography, with long, lingering shots of richly colored scenery in place of the constant barrage of imagery in vogue today. Some movies are better than others, of course, with one black and white movie from 1947 that does not really fit into the ""peplum"" category, a genre that only really started to begin in the late 50's. Most of the stars are male bodybuilders from this era, and it does prove entertaining to compare the physiques of these fellows, which could be arguably described as pleasing to the eye, with the current hyper-muscularity of  contemporary bodybuilders whose metamorphoses may not have such aesthetic appeal, at least to a substantially wide audience.

  The battle scenes are muted, with little over-the-top blood and guts thrown in for shock effect. The story is what matters, with a modicum of character development in the hero sometimes happening. Color degradation has set in in a few prints, but it is nice to have all these readily available in one box.",1403395200,,1226,4.965853658536585

2555509,5,B000F9SUT4,"WOW I had to revisit this review & I am really surprised at the very low ratings people are giving this value pack!!!  What do you expect, your getting 50 movies for under 12 dollars!!!This is a outstanding value pack of great entertainment!  Great entertainment you might ask? Yes I say great without hesitation, because I rate a movie for what it is & yes there are a lot of what people call B-rate movies in this huge collection of sword & sandal films! But they succeed in entertaining on a low budget. If you wanted to find reasons to complain you can. The transfer is cropped & you won't get Oscar winning performances from these films. But when you consider the low cost & that you get hours of great fun it makes a huge difference! My biggest complaint is that the movie ""The Avenger"" a really good film that is advertised in color & it is black & white. Now I looked it up & it was the sequel to ""The Trojan Horse"" that is offered in color & ""The Avenger"" was made in color. I think ""The Avenger"" would be visually stunning in color & I can't figure out how a film loses color. Other than this I think the rest are in color to be honest I haven't viewed them all yet I jumped to ""The Avenger"" hoping I scored the color version, but no such luck! I still have seen most of these films over the years & can tell you there are hours of fun for those rainy or freezing days. There are some real gems in this value pack & for all the nit picking I still give it 5 stars because the collection is as bulky as the men that star in them! I think it is a great introduction for kids to the genre without having excessive nudity & graphic violence! So if your looking to bulk up your sword & sorcery collection with the films that started it all you can't go wrong for the price!!! If your a armchair critic steer clear of these as you may have a convulsion!! Ok I have spent a little more time with this collection & feel I should correct myself there are at least three B/W movies in the collection two are labeled as such in the handy booklet that gives a brief description of each film & then their is the curiously labeled color but B/W ""The Avenger"" mentioned above. Some of the cheesiest titled films in this collection will surprise you! Low budget high adventure & unbelievable value!!!!",1395878400,10,2295,4.237442922374429
2555510,4,B000F9SUT4,"Let me just say that I'm a huge fan of the inexpensive Mill Creek Entertainment Movie Packs, I own about 25 of them. The 50 movie and 100 movie packs offer some great value. I never expect pristine quality from any of these bargain basement, ""public domain"" movie sets and I'm absolutely fine with some film jitter, dirt & scratches, altered aspect ratios, old TV prints, and the like. There has been no restoration on any of these films. Having said that I'm a little bit disappointed with the image quality on a few of the films they included in Warriors, just a few. There are movies in this collection that shouldn't be here, thankfully, they are in the minority. They are too blurry to enjoy, the VHS versions were probably clearer. An effort to find better source materials would have been appreciated.

Another issue has to do with age and film decomposition. Many of these Drive-In action epics were originally presented in spectacular color, and unfortunately a small group of them have lost some of their ""cinematic glory and picturesque beauty"". Due to age and lack of proper care, color dyes fading, problems like vinegar syndrome, etc., they have started to decay. Their once brilliant colors have faded back into the ancient arena of celluloid film history. Landscapes, blue skies, oceans, spectacular sets, costumes, & skin tones aren't the correct color or proper tint anymore.

This is not Mill Creek's fault, it's due to the way colored movies were made, processed, and stored, starting way back in the fifties. Exposure to warm temperatures and high humidity causes damage. Film preservationist's now recommend that films from this era be stored at much cooler temperatures.

Color fading is caused by spontaneous chemical changes in the image dyes of color films. Some older motion pictures from the 50's and 60's have turned ugly, they have an obvious ""orange/red/purple"" look to them. This is caused by the rapid fading of the cyan and yellow image dyes that were in use back then. Using Warriors as an example, a few of the films have been affected. The image is still sharp enough, but the color is very poor, so you either live with it or turn down the color completely and watch them in black and white.

Okay, that's the bad news. The good news is that there are 50 movies in the set and MOST of them are still quite viewable and enjoyable. The way I look at it, is like this, if I get to enjoy just five or ten of the titles...it's worth it! The Warrior's collection has ""tons"" of great films worth watching...

Most of the films are of Italian origin and were made during the 1950's & 1960's. They feature the top Italian stars and musclemen of the genre like Reg Park, Alan Steel, Mark Forest, and Steve Reeves. There are still a few casting surprises though...Orson Welles, Rod Taylor, and Alan Ladd show up on screen, as well as the very beautiful Debra Paget who stars in Cleopatra's Daughter. Like the Spaghetti Western, this branch of Italian Cinema also has it's own special appeal. This Sword and Sandal collection features heroes, villains, and conquerors. Hercules, Samson, David & Goliath, Spartacus, Ulysses, Caesar, and more provide the adventure. There are 13 discs in Warriors, and although many of these movies definitely show their age, there's still plenty left to keep you glued to the TV screen and interested. I rate it four stars. Warriors is fun, nostalgic entertainment, from a bygone era, that's suitable for the entire family. Ya, gotta like that.",1395014400,,3502,4.800995024875622

so that very little of the film remains.

2.center cropping- taking a 2.35.1 widescreen film and just filming the center of the screen in 1.33.1 hoping that stuff comes on screen.

3.the movies listed as being in color that are in b&w.

4.colors faded into almost 1 or 2 solid colors.

While I do realize some Mill Creek sets have disks that don't play--I've contacted their customer service several times over imperfect disks which were promptly replaced--this set played beautifully.

The movies range from campy fun to more serious efforts--White Warrior from Warner Brothers, for instance which details the fight of a Turkish warriors vs the Russian Tzar and his armies--they're all rare films that are difficult to find. And you certainly won't find them all assembled in one neat package for this price.

Okay, I'll admit in places the soundtracks are not perfect--also keep in mind they're dubbed from Italian to English so mouth movements on the bulk of these movies cannot match--but they're all totally watchable.

One thing, do be careful removing the disks from their sleeves or you can scratch them. Also, if a disk doesn't immediately play, try wiping it off to remove any smudges or fingerprints that may be on the surface of the disk.

2555542,5,B000F9SUT4,"Peplum, a.k.a. Sword and Sandal, is the most underrated movie genre, yet it produced the most prolific output in the briefest time span than that of any other type of film. Italy outdid everyone else with this highly successful genre, whose heyday lasted from the late '50's to the early '60's.

The films' entertainment value shouldn't be based on the current condition of the worn, dubbed prints that have been in circulation for years. Actually, these movies were difficult to make as they involved historically accurate period costumes, huge sets depicting ancient architecture, and the staging of large scale battle scenes requiring hundreds of extras and horses. This kind of blood and guts filmmaking is virtually unknown today, when crowds of real people and constructed sets are replaced easily enough via sanitized CGI effects. Back then, directors and actors really had to flex some creative as well as physical muscle working on a peplum picture, and the fact that we don't see them made like this anymore only makes them that much more enjoyable. Often times the costumes, props and sets were recycled from big budgeted epics, and this was a very economical strategy that made the production of so much peplum not only possible, but extremely profitable as well.

I was first introduced to these movies as a pre-teen in the early '70's when a local Chicago T.V. station ran them on late Friday nights. Even then the color was off and they were 16mm, full screen ratio prints duped off the widescreen originals, but once I became immersed in the plot and action, I got past all of that. Although I never thought the English dubbing was tacky, seeing them all in their original Italian language would be ideal, but highly unlikely.

Mill Creek's Warriors 50 movie pack is a 13-disc plethora of peplum that any fan is sure to enjoy. The collection includes many classics of the genre, such as GOLIATH AND THE DRAGON, HERCULES IN THE HAUNTED WORLD, HERCULES AGAINST THE MOON MEN, HERCULES UNCHAINED, HERO OF ROME, ALI BABA AND THE SEVEN SARACENS and THE GIANT OF MARATHON. Actors who built their careers on peplum- Steve Reeves, Mark Forest, Gordon Scott, Reg Park, Gordon Mitchell - are all here. But there's also offbeat titles like DUEL OF CHAMPIONS with Alan Ladd and the sword and sandal spoof, COLOSSUS AND THE AMAZON QUEEN with Rod Taylor. Another rarity is CLEOPATRA'S DAUGHTER starring the beautiful Debra Paget. All of the films are entertaining to varying degrees and feature lots of well mounted action, with several that have intriguing storylines and some pretty good acting. Even the mediocre ones are worthwhile because of the eye candy prominently on display with all the gorgeous women, costumes, sets, and location photography. Sometimes there's unintentional humor, but that only adds to the fun.

The quality of the films in this set ranges from fair to good; the downside being the shifted color and incorrect aspect ratio on most of the titles. But again, this is how they've looked for years and we'll most likely never see them properly restored - at least not as a 50 film mega pack. That said, you can't go wrong with this very affordable set since you get a literal library that covers a wide spectrum of the genre. I occasionally pop in a disc at random because the movies are so easy to watch.

My ***** rating is based on DVD content; quality of the tranfers is ***.

However, as it is very unlikely that Criterion (or anyone else) is going to release a remastered Peplum box set any time in the future, we Peplum fans should be pleased that we at least have this fine collection to enjoy.
All the heroes of the genre are here ... Steve Reeves, Reg Park, Gordon Scott, Mark Forest, Gordon Mitchell etc etc ... and the selection of films is varied and interesting.  Here you will find classics such as Hercules Unchained, Hero of Rome, Giant of Marathon, The Avenger and The Ten Gladiators alongside some of the more obscure titles in the genre. Peplums are a much under-rated genre but they are among the most enjoyable films ever produced en masse.  They feature brave heroes, sniveling cowards, slimy villains, evil tyrants, femme fatales and virginal maidens .... they also feature mythical beasts, spectular locations, colourful costumes, great action, romance and occasionally even a good script.
I love this collection.  I never expected to be able to watch many of these films as they used to be virtually untraceable.

2555556,3,B000F9SUT4,"Like most reviewers, I'am a real fan of Greek mythology and of course of Steve Reeves too. The price of this collection is quite good, but... the main problem is that there are some films such as the Avenger in black and white -no problem with it- that has been just copied from VHS, so the blur at the bottom. It's quite easy to eliminate this blur if you use a freeware software such as Virtual Dub, so I don't understand why this.  When I see a film I bought recently, Julios Ceasar, a 1953 film in black and white too, I really hope in the future we will see a collection like this one in excellent quality even if the original films were in black and white. In general the color films of this collection were acceptable, as I never expected they were so good as other ones I've bought recently such as The Vikings(Kirk Douglas), Ulyses(Kirk Douglas too), which are in certain sense very good in sofar as quality. There is one thing I want to add: it's remarkable how good were these films based on greek mythology, their plot I liked it very much!

One last thing: originally these films were offered closed-captioned, so I made a complaint at Amazon and they recognized me some money, because they weren't CC. This fact impressed me so much, at the point I thought, the problem is not money if you can offer a better quality!

But a better quality can be obtained now, after the technology used in Avatar and in the last film of the Planet of the Apes. How wonderful it would be to use this technology, to reborn these classics of the sword-and-sandal!",1311811200,3,1558,4.421602787456446

2555562,4,B000F9SUT4,"You've already got the big picture: 50 movies indiscriminately plucked from the public domain in variable quality for a low, low price.  If you're looking for good special effects, consistent story telling or even a stab at digital remastering, this isn't the place but it DOES give us a pretty good overview of a mostly forgotten genre of film-making. Maybe the very best sword and sandal movies are missing: the original Steve Reeves ""Hercules,"" ""Hercules in the Underworld,"" and ""The Colossus of Rhodes"" but with 50 titles, you get A LOT.

Let's take care of a couple of pre-conceptions:  Maybe I'm an incurable innocent, but I could never understand why the Italian muscle man film became a gay icon for so many years.  As for myself and most of my friends, we were too busy ogling Sylvia Koscina to care much about Steve Reeve's biceps  -- other than, you know, thinking that maybe we ought to go to the gym and work out a little.

Perhaps Jacques Tournier's ""Giant of Marathon"" had something to do with the stigma.  In this one, a smiling, clean-shaven Steve Reeves is lovingly photographed surrounded by full frontal nudity, male statues.  Mix in some sweaty close ups of guy on guy wrestling and more white diapers than you're likely to see in a hospital maternity ward and you start seeing how people could perceive the genre as gay.

But that's just ONE movie!

No, mostly these are just basic, good-natured if formulaic adventure movies injected with a strong dose of fantasy.  If you don't mind the variable quality of the prints and the even more variable quality of the dubbing (sometimes one actor sounds like he's been dubbed by several different people,) these are pleasant -- if perfectly brainless -- popcorn munchers.  They reflect a much simpler time, not necessarily ancient Greece, but the early 1960s when we thought the problems of the world and their solution were obvious.  Just call in the strongest guy you know and have him beat up the bad guys.  Of course, as we got mired in Viet Nam, society and its entertainmnent grew more sophisticated.  The heros became more complex, or even anti-heros, and society's problems were portrayed as something more ambiguous.

Hmm.  ""Maciste Against The Taliban"" or ""Hercules vrs The Drug Cartels"" -- there's a couple of movies I'd like to see.

The second preconception is that the body builder/stars were talentless, male bimbos.  It turns out that some of these guys are actually quite good on camera. Steve Reeves physicalizes beautifully.  (I'm not talking about him posing with his shirt off.  I mean his emotional reaction and involvement in the scene.)  Dubbed or not, he's always in character and aware of what's going on around him.  (Compare him to say, Kirk Morris, who can be pretty clueless and you see the difference.)  Gordon Scott, Reg Park, Alan Steele, and Don Vadis all turn in good work.  Even Mark Forrest - who for most of this package is stuck in a sludge of Maciste movies -- gets to show his versatility in ""Goliath and the Dragon,"" where his character is allowed to do more than just smile, flex his muscles and disappear into the background.

My advice: Turn off your inner, negative critic and meet these movies on their own terms.  They can be fun. (And don't forget the popcorn.)

Of the ""classic"" muscle man epics contained, I think the following are best:

Hero of Rome (Gordon Scott); Hercules and the Captive Women (Reg Park): Hercules Unchained (Steve Reeves, the second movie of the series) and my favorite of the package, an honest to goodness, unexpected gem: ""Ulysses Against the Son of Hercules""

""Ulysses Against the Son of Hercules,"" was marketed under the ""Mighty Sons of Hercules"" banner and so officially is not a Hercules movie.  You have to remember that these movies were made in Italy and then re-tooled for the American market. I guess because they pronounced the name ""Her-a-cles"" (some reviewers are saying ""Pericles"" but trusty IMDB lists the character as ""Ercole,"" which is Italian for Hercules,) the American distributor was thoroughly confused.  Anyway, here ""Heracles"" becomes the ""SON of Hercules "" -- which means that ANYTHING is possible if you're a Greek god.

Even though it's saddled with some pseudo-Shakespearian prose, the dubbing isn't bad.  The actors seem to be really TRYING to match some committed screen performances.  Michael Lane plays Hercules as the enforcer of the Gods sent to Earth to punish Ulysses for blinding the Cyclops. Even though he doesn't have Steve Reeve's well-defined physic, Mike Lane is a BIG man and proves wonderful in the part.  Not only does he manage to be sincere and even touching in some pretty badly written love scenes, but overall his characterization reminds you of a surly, New York City beat cop who has grown sick of his job.  (It works -- beautifully.)  Wirey French star George Marchal convincingly portrays Ulysses as an aging and gristled war vet with saltwater in his veins and quicksilver behind his eyes.  From the surprising opening in which Ulysses is captured by pirates, the movie quickly turns into a rather good, buddy, road pic with Hercules trying to get his charge back to Olympus so he can stand trial. (It's been mentioned that the plot is like Robert DeNiro's ""Midnight Run.""  Well, ""Midnight Run"" is like several movies which came before it -- at least a dozen westerns I can think of.  Anybody remember John Wayne in ""Stagecoach?!"" I was surprised to see the plot turn up in one of these crazy, sword and sandal epics though.)

There are some cool things along the way.  Scenes of Ulysses matching wits with a deranged ""King Lago"" are VERY well acted, in fact, flat out terrific.  The scene in which Ulysses and Hercules flatter their way out of captivity with the Queen of the Bird People also comes off well.  (It's genuinely funny. Check out Mike Lane's reaction when Ulysses starts his spiel.)  So, in spite of some cheesy special effects and wacky plot turns, ""Ulysses Against the Son of Hercules"" turns out to be a pretty darn good movie with an unexpected but entirely logical denouement.

It just goes to show ya.  It's not the genre you're working in that's important; it's what you DO with it.

Many of the other Hercules/Son of Hercules and Maciste flicks, although not outstanding in anyway, prove eminently entertaining.  ""Colossus Against The Amazon Women"" features Rod Taylor supplying comic relief for Ed Fury and LOTS of beautiful women.  ""Giants of Rome"" is a decent, sword and sandal version of ""The Guns of Navarone,"" and there are a couple of very likeable Ali Baba/Arabian Nights flicks thrown in as well.

Not all of these are action movies.  Some are historical epics.  I think a real stand out is Terrence Young's ""Duel of the Champions"" starring an ailing Alan Ladd.  (And even though he's past his prime, Alan Ladd has enough charisma and acting chops to raise the level of the movie.  He's quite good.) Cameron Mitchell, a sadly under-rated actor is splendid in ""Last of the Vikings"" and as a blonde haired Julius Caesar in ""Caesar the Conqueror.""  Gordon Mitchell, with his battered, craggy features got to play both heroes and villains.  I particularly liked him in ""Fury of Achilles,"" which is a goofy, Old Hollywood-esque whitewashing of the Trojan War legend.  ""The White Warrior "" is one of Steve Reeves better pictures. (Sorry gals, but he keeps his shirt on for most of it.)  ""Cleopatra's Daughter (Debora Paget)"" has a silly plot - but it's one of the few, watchable movies I've seen set in Egyptian times. ""Damon and Pythius,""  I liked because - well, Guy Williams is in it.  (The little kid in me will ALWAYS be a Zorro/Guy Williams fan.)

So, to concur with the other reviewers: You're getting 50 movies for chump change.  There is much to delight, much to annoy, and much that is simply mediocre, but it's a pleasant way to kill time - LOTS of time.",1261008000,7,7887,4.804154302670623

This is an AWESOME Collection of some of the best Sword & Sandals Flicks ever made! It includes some really hard to find movies in it, most of good/average quality, but all watchable, and very enjoyable!

1. If your looking for HD Quality, Newsflash, this isn't it! These movies were made back in the day of reel to reel film. So you will almost NEVER be able to find most of these flims in better condition than this.
2. For those reviewing and crying about Quality. This was a very small and citchy genre. Like Spagetti Westerns, and B-Movie Horror flicks. Most of the original footage for these was tossed out in the trash. So to find a collection of this many flicks of this genre, in any kind of watchable condition is pretty amazing.
3. Like B-movie Horrors, these are fun and cheesy. They are over-acted, badly dubbed, special effects(if any) are laughable, and the stories are see through. We know this, they knew it when they made the movies. If you truly have a problem with this then you probably aren't a real fan of the genre. Don't buy this and complain, go watch your Harry Potter movies instead.
But if you are a fan of this genre, Buy this collection. Make a bucket of Popcorn, Sit back and enjoy, you'll be glad you did!",1244678400,3,1422,5.046808510638298
2555564,5,B000F9SUT4,"Nothing could entertain more than this wonderful collection of warriors and gladiators. These movies are the ancestors of the super-heroes of today, and the dialogue, trite as it may seem, was a premonition of what was  to become an industry standard in our time, so even for high brow audiences this is an interesting collection. It does not matter that the dubbing does not match the speech, it's actually better, because one feels ""something"" is missing in the translation, which adds to the allure of what would otherwise be ordinary and vapid dialogue.  I will never tire of watching Steve Reeves in his interpretations of Hercules, but there is much more here than that, Ali Baba and the Seven Sarracens, for example, which I did not know even existed prior to this collection, is a masterpiece of the genre, including some of the most delightfully ridiculous head pieces for women that would put chorus girls in Vegas to shame. Actually the 'Evil"" queens and princesses in these movies are big competition fo the sex in the city types that we see everywhere now, except these ones have the expressions of the silent film era down packed, and are a lot sexier than the plastic barbie dolls-look alikes of today. This series is also probably the best record on film of what huge breasts looked like on real women before the arrival of silicone.
There are also miles of muscle on the men, which can be studied as early steroidal experiments, but I must add that the heroes always somehow manage to look more natural than their counterparts today, for one thing there is no intention to act or project characterization, which is a relief, it should also be setting good examples for hunks of today with acting aspirations. These movies are great fun and ideal for relaxation. The happy endings are as predictable as the 'ritual' dances that prop up in every court banquet scene. The only thing that worried me when buying was the condition of these movies, and granted, they have not been well preserved and truly deserve a good restoration effort, however that being said, I was not at all dissapointed. Once you get used to color fading in and out of scenes in sepia tones, it actually adds to the 'special effects' for that antique documentary look. I strongly recommend this package of delight that will save you from hours of useless current event news or boring contemporary cinema that centers on household trivia and are nowhere as exciting or entertaining as the adventures of these heroes.",1244419200,4,2502,4.802784222737819

2555566,4,B000F9SUT4,"I'll admit that I was a little wary when I purchased this 50 movie set. I hadn't heard of most of the films, and these dvds of public domain flicks are often a crapshoot in terms of quality and entertainment value. But I only paid $9 for my copy, so how bad could it be, right? So I took a chance. Well, it paid off handsomely! I've only watched 4 of the 50 flicks and I can already tell that this is several days' worth of riotous entertainment for a fan of campy, crazy Hercules type movies like myself. The super-obscure classics ""Thor and the Amazon Women"" and ""Colossus and the Amazon Queen"" alone are worth what I paid! (gotta love them Amazons...)

HOWEVER--anyone interested in this set should be forewarned. What you're getting here is basically is a collection of the American, dubbed versions of these movies, transferred from VHS tapes and occasionally television broadcast tapes and cropped from widescreen down to what used to be TV standard size. And on top of that, many of the film prints used for those video transfers were damaged and/or faded as well. So, don't expect to see quality any better than you would from a public domain video tape you might buy at a garage sale. The effect is quite a bit like watching Tarrantino's recent ""Grindhouse"" double feature, with all the scratches, blotches and jumpcuts (except most of these flicks are more fun than Tarrantino's was). BUT (and this for me is a big ""but"") there are a lot of crazy movies in this set that you're just not going to find anywhere else (and certainly not all in one place). So if you remember the days when crazy stuff like this played your local independant TV station on late nights, early mornings and weekend afternoons, this is a bonanza for you. Or if you just like insane MST3K-worthy entertainment, this is a gold mine.
All of these are from the late 50s to mid-sixties--no crappy 80s or 90s stuff, only pure peplum nonsense!

The packaging is good, too, I think. Instead of the standard multiple dvd holders that stack the discs or put them in complicated fold-over cases, Mill Creek has just put each double-sided dvd in its own little cardboard sleeve, and then all the sleeves fit snugly into the larger box. And there are only two flicks per side, so the reproduction of the VHS or beat up 16mm prints is pretty good, considering. At least there are not a lot of compression issues you get when some companies cram 8 hours worth of movies on one side.",1233187200,,2453,4.5600907029478455

I have copies given freely through gossip magazines (in Greece, that is) that are perfect.

2555569,3,B000F9SUT4,"I must admit I was taken by surprise with the price of this DVD collection. At $16.49 for 13 DVDs and 50 movies, that's a giveaway price in my book. But then again, who better to thank for this once in a lifetime offer than the people who made all this possible - Amazon and affiliates?

The price of the whole collection buys only one DVD movie here in my country, South Africa. Pity Amazon no longer trust our post office system, and wants to hire expensive couriers for deliveries here!

I wish they would speak with the powers that be and try to find a solution.

This DVD collection contains all the ""sword and sandles"" movies I saw when I was 8-9 years old.

Although some  of the movies, say 5-10 in the whole collection, seem to have some strange colours probably due to aging), the rest, especially favourites like Alan Ladd's Duel of Champions and Hercules Unchained are OK.

Then, if you're like me and want to relieve those old memories of the sixties and pay the lowest amount, you won't mind this minor setback. So  grab yourself one pack and enjoy all these movies again and again.

Remember Machiste, Ursus, Samson, Ullyses, the Ten Gladiators with Dan Vadis? They're all there!

Another downside of this collection is that Romulus and Remus, Perseus and the Gorgon/Medusa, Hercules in the Center of the earth are excluded. Pity!",1214784000,4,1345,4.617647058823529

While I enjoy the Horror and Martial Arts box sets I purchased, the Warriors box set is all homoerotic, 1950's crap.  Most of these movies have no discernable plot - they are simply vehicles for greased-up, muscle-bound guys to wrestle with each other on film.  I guess if you are into that kind of stuff, you might enjoy this set; otherwise, I'd pass on it.",1214438400,6,530,4.227722772277228
2555571,5,B000F9SUT4,"Well, I do!
Here is why I would give this 50-Pack, and ONLY this 50-Pack, the lofty ""five stars"". It's quite simple, really. Let's say you're thinking of getting the Western 50-Pack. Here are a few universally recognized masterpieces of that particular genre: Red River, High Noon, Shane, Rio Bravo, The Searchers, the Sergio Leone films, the John Ford films, the Anthony Mann films, a couple of Sam Peckinpahs, etc., etc.. But you know what? You will not find any of 'em in the Western 50-Pack. Same can be said of getting truly great movies in any of the Horror, Crime, Mystery, etc.. Instead you will get a collection of really obscure, low-budget curiosities--which is not automatically a reason not to buy the set!! Some of those little B and C movies are pretty cool and fun to watch.
But with the ""muscleman"" epic in general, there ARE NO masterpieces to speak of. The 1960's were the golden age of the Italian macho man movie, and you get virtually everything from those wonderful days in this set!!

I am old enough to fondly recall that period, and how eagerly I awaited Saturday afternoons, when I could watch ""Epic Theatre"", presented weekly by a local TV station. I would watch the likes of the muscular Reg Park, Gordon Scott, Reg Lewis, Dan Vadis, et. al, engage in battle with dragons, marauders, monsters, rebels, soldiers, and other formidable adversaries.

In every one of these movies you'd have the following:
(1.) Muscular Hero (scantily clad, though every other man is dressed for late fall);
(2.) Evil Temptress (scantily clad queen or sorceress with big bosom (usually dark-haired, big fake eyelashes and makeup, always trying to get Mr. Muscles into her boudoir, but with a dark, sinister ulterior motive, having to do with a lust for power or wealth);
(3.) Virginal Beauty (a sweetly beautful, virtuous lass who is in love with ""Herc"", but with a smaller bosom than evil temptress, blonde hair, higher neckline, less skin exposed, less makeup, who will need rescuing several times);
(4.) Opposing Army (scads of armor-clad, shield-carrying, spear-wielding soldiers (who are always trying to capture or kill the hero; one favorite scene is when the hero has been seemingly subdued by the guards; he's completely covered by his enemies, in a twisting mass of humanity, but suddenly the entire group explodes outward, bodies flying, as Mr. Atlas flexes his awesome power and emerges defiantly from the pile);
(5.) Dinner/Dance scene (present are the Evil Queen, the King, Mr. Muscles and a few of his boys, the noblemen/women, armed guards, and servant girls. For their dining enjoyment, scantily-clad dancers emerge from the wings, and perform the seductively exotic veil dances, accompanied by a full orchestra of lutes, flutes and God knows what other instruments the director thought were appropriate);
(6.) Forced Feats of Strength (the evil queen and/or king makes hero do some ridiculous act  which demonstrates his enormous power; it's usually something involving impaling or burning or falling into a pit of ravenous beasts. If Herc is unsuccessful, innocent girl or buddy dies;
(7.) Dubbing of English (much of the charm of these films comes from the magnificently cheesy dubbing; the same guy must have done the hero's voices for all of these. He possessed an inimitable, impossibly manly and virile baritone. ""You'll Pay For Your Treachery"" or something very much like it, is a line you'll hear over and over again in these films!

Some reviewers were critical of the so-called ""Digital Remastering"" boast which appears on the package. Who cares?? Do you expect the original recordings of Igor Stravinsky or Robert Johnson or Louis Armstrong to be pristine? The tape hiss and fidelity imperfections add to the whole experience. I'd say the same about these films; I watched them on a little black and white TV in the 60's. In a way I'm glad I don't have to worry about scratches and poor color.

The bottom line is this: if you love those wonderfully goofy, cheesy, innocent Italian sword and sandal hero flicks, an admittedly esoteric genre, you MUST own this set. But I'm not being critical of the movies; I hasten to add that the creators of these epics were really trying to make good quality entertainment, just not Oscar-worthy entertainment.
They succeeded admirably.",1199750400,160,4310,4.988873435326843

This deal is even better when you consider that many of the movies in this collection are available as individual movie DVD's at prices of $5 and higher. Many of the movies in this collection are presented in better condition than they are from other DVD companies.

So what can you expect?  I bought these videos for one purpose only and that was to bring back some nostalgia from my youth when things were better and Hero's still defeated the bad guy.

Unlike a few of the other people that reviewed this Movie pack I knew that there was only so much you could do with the media that these movies were recorded on.  Maybe some day they can make them look like today's wide screen dolby DVDs, but for the price they were well worth it.

The one including here is almost unwatchable.

So in closing, the $15 I paid for this pack was worth it. I've enjoyed hours of entertainment and discovered a slew of old movies I had never seen before . The only thing missing are trailers, which is now an option that's pretty much standard on DVDs.

2555587,3,B000F9SUT4,"The heyday of the swords & sandals epics was brief: 1959 to '64. Primarily Italian-made (although French and other European concerns had a hand in many of these), the films usually featured an American or British headliner along with a cast of native talent. Historic location shoots added to the glamor of these action-packed morality plays (that the good guys usually won). They were fun, exciting, filled with beautiful people, costumes and scenery, and are of a unique cinematic style that will probably never be seen again.

Featured actors in the WARRIORS 50 MOVIE PACK COLLECTION include Steve Reeves, Cameron Mitchell, Ed Fury, Mark Forest, Gordon Scott, Guy Williams, Reg Park and Gordon Mitchell. One movie actually stars a young Roger Moore, while ex-heavyweight boxer (and giant) Primo Carnera has a supporting role in another. Also to be found here: Orson Welles, Broderick Crawford, Alan Ladd, Debra Paget, Robert Alda and more!

2555588,5,B000F9SUT4,"Now, I'm not a student of Italian cult movies, a B movie expert, or person who is somehow predisposed to the ""Sword and Sandals"" genre.  I am also too young to remember the sixties, so I never got to see these movies air for the first time or played during the Saturday afternoon matinee.

But I can tell you there are some great movies in this collection.  When I say ""great"" I mean most of these movies have a compelling story-they will captivate you for the duration of the film.  And the stories are surprisingly rich in variety.  Sure, they are all lumped in the same ""Sword and Sandals"" genre, but I don't think a person could watch a these movies and fairly say ""they are all the same.""  There is a lot of variety here.

Admittedly, the picture quality and sound on these movies is not that great.  But that is not to say that the movies are unwatchable.  So far, it hasn't been an issue for me.  There are a few places where the sound was too low or garbled to understand, but in those very rare instances, it doesn't really make a difference because you get what is going on from surrounding context.  Moreover, this was probably how the sound was recorded during the original production.

The special effects are also quite cheesy, especially during fighting sequences.  But it does not matter.  When you have a good story, you will not care about them.

And you get FIFTY movies for the price.  What a steal.  I think I got my money's worth after watching the first six movies.  I've been coming home after work, popping in a DVD, and watching a movie a day.

I'm telling you -- you can't go wrong here.  You are bound to find movies you like in this collection.",1175644800,18,1673,4.387622149837133

than desireable. But fifty sword, sandal and sweat movies in one set is

hard to beat!

 My only real complaint is that this set is missing Duel of the Titans!

The only sword and sandal flix that both Steve Revees and Gordon Scott

starred in together!

find, and if you can locate a copy, its usually in the form of a badly made bootleg copy! Hopefully someday it will come out legitimitly on dvd.",1175385600,16,545,4.37
2555590,5,B000F9SUT4,"I've been in muscle heaven for the past four months, watching and rewatching some of my favorites from these 50 sword and sandals sagas. One fabulous revelation is the discovery of Mark Forest, probably the most phenomenal looking Hercules of them all--with the exception of the Man-Who-Looks-Like-A-God, Steve Reeves. Forest was massive, with a beautifully shaped face, head and of course, that incredible torso of bulging pecs and ridged abs. He also conveyed a powerful sensuality lacking in nearly all of the musclemen you see here. His amazing physique is starred in ""Kindar the Invunerable"" and ""Hercules Against the Mongols."" Also contained in this collection is the ultimate valentine dedicated to Steve Reeves, ""Giant of Marathon"" where his fabulous torso is exploited from the first frame to the last. Lucky for us, he plays most of the picture in a very brief white loincloth which emphasizes his phenomenal body. At the beginning, there's a scene where he is crowned with a wreath of olive leaves as his fellow Olympian warriors look on. Reeves steps forward and your mouth drops for his body is lit and glows beyond belief. This is the best investment I've ever made in purchasing a DVD collection. You're able to watch and compare all the muscle men who went over to Italy in the early 60s: Reg Park, Don Vardis, Gordon Scott, Gordon Mitchell and all the others. This is a collection to treasure and hope for a follow-up sequel that will contain the rest of Mark Forest and Steve Reeves body of work.",1174608000,11,1514,4.872093023255814
2555591,5,B000F9SUT4,"If you are old enough to remember television before there was cable, you might share my memories of my favorite time of the week back when I was growing up. In those distant days, local television stations used to air old movies late Friday and Saturday evenings, and my guilty pleasure was to wait until the rest of my family had gone to bed, then heat up a TV dinner (they came in aluminum trays back then, remember?) and watch some fabulous old flick. My favorite evenings were when they would show fusto films---those poorly dubbed Italian epics about Hercules, his countless sons and various heroes from antiquity, both actual mythological characters or totally fabricated. The print quality was usually pretty terrible and the film itself really cheesy, but it was also invariably a total hoot, what with super-hunky leading men showing off their chests, big-busted princesses and priestesses showing off theirs, totally amateur battle scenes and the inevitable dance sequence with some of the most horrendous choreography imaginable. High camp never got much higher than these gems. This set allows one to recreate those glorious late-night viewing experiences. Are these high-quality dubs? Not at all; most are scratchy or have washed-out color (then again, I originally saw them on a black-and-white TV) or muffled soundtracks---just the way they used to be in the terrible prints shown on late-night local television. Some (such as ""Hercules Unchained"") are as good as you'll be able to find in individually released versions from other companies, while others decidedly are not---this version of ""Hercules in the Haunted World,"" for instance, should not be confused with the beautifully restored wide-screen version available from Fantoma (it's even edited differently). My only gripe---and it's a minor one---is that at least six of these films are duplicates from the same company's SciFi Classics 50 Moviepak (what they were doing on a SciFi collection is beyond me). But I'm still giving this set five stars, mainly for old-times' sake, and because the price is so ridiculously low that it's an unbeatable bargain for those who enjoy tripping down memory lane.",1169510400,15,2175,5.199430199430199
2555592,3,B000F9SUT4,"DVDs offer 50 sword-and-sandal movies, some I have not seen before.  Some movies epitomize this genre, such as Steve Reeve's ""Giant of Marathon"" and ""Hercules Unchained"".  Some of the movies are outlandish, including ""Conqueror of the Orient"" and ""Hercules Against the Mongols"", unsuccessfully compromising different eras.  The quality of the DVDs are satisfactory due to, I believe, primarily the age of the movies.  However, you definitely get your money's worth for 50 feature films.",1168387200,4,486,5.527027027027027
2555593,5,B000F9SUT4,"Yeah OK, the source prints used for this DVD box set are kind of nappy lookin', dubiously collected (check how the bottom of many of the films is cropped off by a black bar to conceal a smaller company's watermark, then re-watermarked by Mill Creek ... one almost has to admire the nerve ...), atrociously presented, ambiguously ""digitally remastered"" -- a term that can mean anything starting with ""Recorded onto DVD from a VHS"" -- and sort of haphazardly collected onto 12 bare bones double sided DVDs that your 12 year old could more imaginatively author on mom's orange iMac after school for a rainy day keep busy project. Many of the films have already been released on DVD by companies like Alpha Video & Something Weird, which sadly may have been the sources for what is on this box set, so don't expect any ""upgrades"" on what you may already have in your collection, and indeed stuff like HERCULES IN THE HAUNTED WORLD have been released on excellent archivally sensitive DVDs. It is a mixed bag to say the least.

*BUT*, anybody who loves Peplum ""Sword and Sandal"" muscleman films with Gladiators, Hercules/Sampson types, lots of Pizza Pizza guards with plumed helmets and gorgeous Italian supporting actresses dressed in flimsy garments performing Veil Dances OR any student of Italian cult B cinema like myself will be well served by this collection. Filmmakers like Mario Bava, Ruggero Deodato, Antonio Margheriti, writers like Ernesto Gastaldi, Bruno Corbucci, composers like Marcello Giombini & Bruno Niccola -- they all got their start in cinema working on these Peplum cheapies, some of which are very imaginatively staged and filled with a kind of endearing charm which seems beyond the grasp of today's big name filmmakers. Peter Jackson's A-list projects cannot hold a candle to stuff like FIRE MONSTERS VS. THE SON OF HERCULES, KINDAR THE INVINCIBLE and GOLIATH VS. THE MOON MEN, which are brimming with imagination and intrigue that still has the power to delight viewers of all ages even forty-five years after they were made. He would probably admit just the same, and point to his childhood love of these films as part of his inspiration.

That's another thing I like about this box set: Here are 50 films that the whole family can enjoy *TOGETHER* for the most part. Sure, some of them might seem a bit violent to a conflict resolution oriented culture raised on the Care Bears and the teachings of Albert Gore Jr., but there really isn't anything on these films that would be unsuitable for somebody 8 to 10 years old, and you can just explain to them that back then they gave the pretty maidens to the Kraken all the time & look how things have changed for the better. What's more important is that the kids won't care about the print qualities one bit. They will be too busy wondering what it would be like to be a Son of Hercules, able to tear trees out of the ground and swing them like a baseball bat, or what it would be like to be a Queen of Rome who makes valiant gladiators swoon at her sandaled feet ... Mom will be too busy admiring the chiseled looks & beefanoid muscular chests of Steve Reeves, Gordon Mitchell, Kirk Morris and Richard Harrison, and Dad will get this funny look on his face during the Veil Dance sequences that are an inevitable and enjoyably innocently cheuvenistic element in these films. Everybody likes a good Veil Dance, and that funny look means that Dad is wondering what it would be like to have a whole harem of them waiting back in his chambers after the kids are tucked in bed. Who wouldn't?

Juvenile fantasies aside, these movies also aren't going to get any better looking: Most of the original source material has been lost to time & neglect -- the bulk of the material is ultimately based on old fullframe English language TV prints that savvy brained individuals rescued from trash dumpsters or at foreclosure auctions when local TV stations stopped showing matinee type movies on the weekends. A lot of the prints are worn and tattered, color rotted or bulb decayed to the point of having their color nearly completely washed out, and re-formatted for small screen presentation in a slipshod manner that had no sensitivity for shot compositions. Not that these were decisions made by the DVD company, mind you, it's just that the genre itself was thought so poorly of that nobody took care of the material and sadly, what you see on these DVDs is about all that's left of them. So don't blame the messenger: Mill Creek did what it could with the material, and you get so much of it that in the long run it doesn't really matter what they look like. And at roughly $.50 cents/film they can be whatever they are and still be a fantastic value.

So here is a highly recommended collection of films for anyone who needs a bunch of cheap DVDs to take to the lake house for the summer or even just for sitting around being bored until school starts up again. And again, for students of the golden era of Euro cult filmmaking this is a must-have history course on how our idol filmmakers & stars got their start in the business, and what a tragic loss the Veil Dance tradition has been to our standards of entertainment.",1153008000,223,5187,4.665573770491803
2555594,2,B000F9SUT4,"This is very good offer except for the quality of many of the movies in the set. Some movies are missing on the DVD (they don't play), others are mislabeled and many movies keep freezing half way thru throughout the movie. I believe the first master set of DVDs should be inspected and played on multiple DVD players to insure they play alright then copies can be made. Otherwise, all copies from a bad first burn will be the same.

8119280,4,B000F9SUT4,"This is one of the most unique of Mill Creek Entertainments 50 movie packs.  Here are 50 movies filled with swords, sandals, bronzed physiques, muddled mythology and a bit of the Bible thrown in as well.  Most of the movies are from the genre that was launched in the United States by Joseph E. Levines release of Hercules (not included in this collection) with Steve Reeves in 1959.  The generally Italian produced spectacles filled the anamorphic widescreen (Dyaliscope, Totalscope, SuperTotalscope, Techniscope, Chromoscope and many others) with action, splashy art direction and saturated color. The genre flooded screens worldwide and dominated Italian film production for about 6 years.  Unfortunately, most of the movies here were mastered from used, faded and pan-and-scanned 16mm television prints.  A few of the color productions are even mastered from black and white prints.
There are actually two editions of this 50 movie pack.  The initial release, packaged in a cardboard container, included the features Devil of the Desert Against the Son of Hercules, Gladiators Seven, Hercules in the Haunted World (aka Hercules in the Centre of the Earth directed by Mario Bava and one of the better entries of the genre), The Lion of Thebes and Sandokan:  Pirate of Malaysia (a rarely seen Steve Reeves film and one of his last). The second edition of this collection, called the Anniversary Edition, packaged in a plastic container, removes those films and replaces them with The Avenger (aka The Last Glory of Troy with Steve Reeves in a black and white print), David and Goliath, Giants of Rome, Spartacus and the Ten Gladiators and Queen of the Amazons (which is out of place here since it is a 1940s Robert Lippert  six reel, black and white jungle release with stock footage and a library music score.
I am giving this release a favorable rating for bringing together so many films from this genre, at an affordable price, that have been rarely seen since the late 1960s/early 1970s.  My rating would have been higher if only the films had been mastered from better prints and presented in the letterbox format.",1507680000,2,2122,5.022792022792022
