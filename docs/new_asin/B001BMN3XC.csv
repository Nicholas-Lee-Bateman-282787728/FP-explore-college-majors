8283544,1,B001BMN3XC,"These products are made by the group formerly known as the Children of God and later The Family international. Due to a lot of bad press they have separated their branding from the cult but it is still run by members who funnel this money straight to their leader Karen Zerby's pockets. The children from TFI have suffered terrible abuse in their childhood including sexual, physical and mental abuse all which is well documented. Some survivors of  the cult are well known: River Phoenix, Joaquin Phoenix, Rose McGowen. Julianna Buhring (Guiness world record holder as the first woman to circumnavigate the work on a bicycle), Taylor Stevens. Some great books you can read about them are Not without my Sister, and The Innocent.
I recommend that you do not buy this product.",1456704000,,775,4.871212121212121
