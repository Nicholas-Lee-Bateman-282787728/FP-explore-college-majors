2106139,1,B0002MINTQ,"This video is a spurious imitation, and a bad one at that.

The original televised Yule Log was the WPIX Yule Log, which debuted on New York's Channel 11, WPIX-TV in 1966.

I, Lawrence F. ""Chip"" Arcuri, along with my former partner on the Yule Log website, Joseph Malzone, restored the audio soundtrack for the 40th anniversary broadcast of the WPIX Yule Log in 2006; the music is now uncut, unedited and has been digitally remastered.

In addition, in 2009, I added a new 4th hour of classic Christmas music to the program.

The original WPIX Yule Log is shown annually on the Antenna TV Network and most Tribune Broadcasting affiliates across the country every year. My Yule Log website is dedicated to the memory and preservation of the original WPIX Yule Log and great classic Christmas music in general.

The original WPIX Yule Log has never been released on home video before; although, we are still hoping that someday it will be. Unfortunately, it is the prohibitive music licensing fees that are the obstacle.

There are a lot of imitations out there, but there is only ONE original and genuine Yule Log -- and it's the WPIX Yule Log.",1179187200,51,1143,4.69
2106140,5,B0002MINTQ,This was great! The sound of the fire wood crackind was great! It was such a warm and relaxing christmas morning unwrapping presents with the yule log on the t.v.!,1169337600,4,163,4.466666666666667
2106141,4,B0002MINTQ,"We also have this product on VCR tape.  The tape is not as clear as the DVD, but the DVD is much darker than the tape.  We kind of like our tape a little better.  Of course, the DVD has nice features the tape doesn't have since we can play it with or without music.",1168819200,4,265,3.7818181818181817
2106142,5,B0002MINTQ,"This dvd is a must have for Christmas.  It is so relaxing to listen to and watch, and has the option of hearing music or just listening to the crackling fire. Definitely worth buying.",1168300800,5,183,4.382352941176471
2106143,5,B0002MINTQ,"I finally found a copy of the Yule Log that used to appear on television on Christmas eve back in the 70s. The bad thing is that I'm old enough to remember it. The good thing is that it still holds the same holiday magic it held back when I was 5. As an adult, I find it seems to move through the song list quicker than I remembered when I was a kid. In a continuous loop, it's not a problem though, as long as you don't get bored. The fire is tended by a hand and a poker only; one never sees the actual person who pokes the log and tries to push a few broken wood pieces back into the fireplace. That itself is worth a laugh. Grab a glass of wine (seriously. You'll need one) and enjoy the warmth of a fire and the fun of holiday music with nothing to cleanup afterward.",1168300800,7,772,3.9235668789808917
2106144,2,B0002MINTQ,"The log is cool and all.  The songs are good.  But if you go for one that doesn't have the ""orginal"" tag you will pay about 1/4 of the price.

I would def say shop around before you purchase this one for $20.  Its quite the holiday ripe-off.  But as you know, everything is more expensive around Xmas",1134950400,18,300,4.103448275862069
2106145,5,B0002MINTQ,Christmastime or not. It's the most cozy fireplace of them all. You can have Christmas Carols or shut them off. The creator even pokes the fire every once in awhile. There is even a neat bonus featurette with winter scenes and music. Love it Year Round.,1420502400,2,253,4.521739130434782
2106146,2,B0002MINTQ,"I wanted the WPIX Yule Log show. Got this, a disappointment with a 65"" HD TV, this is blurry and the music not as good as wished.",1419552000,,129,3.814814814814815

2106149,3,B0002MINTQ,"It is pretty good,with a 10-12 minute ranch/farm scenery added on ,snow covered and all. I just can't stand up to ""the original WPIX yule log,which is on every year,and is 4hours long  in many areas of this grand country",1393891200,,220,4.5
2106150,5,B0002MINTQ,I love the fact that the DVD is programmed to loop and continuously play.  You do not have to press play when it ends.  A fireplace is always soothing to watch and you can play the DVD even without the songs so you can use it all year long.  It is just great,1389744000,,258,3.830188679245283
2106151,3,B0002MINTQ,there were many similar for lessor price and on tv you could even get it for free! Live and Learn.,1389571200,,98,3.95
2106152,1,B0002MINTQ,"It has to be the WPIX version to get a better rating from me.  Grew up with the WPIX Yule Log----my brothers & I thought it was hilarious.  We'd go to the television set & pretend to warm our hands by the fire.

Ah, nothing warms the cockles of the heart quite like the electric glow of a television set for such a momentous occasion!",1386979200,,334,4.107692307692307
2106153,5,B0002MINTQ,I love popping this DVD in and falling asleep to the sound of crackling fire. I use it all year long!,1377129600,,101,3.857142857142857

2106165,5,B0002MINTQ,I totally love it.  I am going to get one for a friend.  Just sit and  relax and loose yourself in this wonderful vidio.,1359072000,,120,3.9166666666666665
2106166,5,B0002MINTQ,My grandchildren slept by the Christmas tree with the yule log on TV.  They didn't even want cartoons on TV the next morning; wanted the yule log fireplace.  LOVE IT,1358467200,,165,4.466666666666667
2106167,5,B0002MINTQ,"Is this the version with the beautiful christmas music by Percy Faith,Mantovani,Paul Mauriat etc? I don't have this dvd but won't buy it unless it comes with the music artist above. The one the WB is showing is the one I want.",1356393600,,226,4.404761904761905
2106168,4,B0002MINTQ,"Our family has enjoyed the original 1970s' VHS version of this Christmas music tape for many years. Yes, it is the original one depicted by the image, not the TV one to which some mistakenly refer. The music selections are the best of the three others we have bought this year while trying to upgrade our old video to DVD and even BluRay to avoid the ridiculous price of $20 for this version. I now wish I had just spent the $18.99, instead of about the same amount trying to save a few bucks. The firepoking adds a live feel to the experience and made it more than a ""talking head"" (or in this case a ""crackling fire"")experience. I suggest you get this one first and end your search for quality music selections plus a real yule log fireplace that will cheer up your front room for hours. (I just put it in my wish list hoping for a sale price after Christmas. After all, I can still play my VHS version for this year. And yes, I am a tad tight.)Enjoy!",1324166400,3,953,4.241758241758242
2106169,1,B0002MINTQ,"I'm from the Bronx, and was eleven when the WPIX Yule Log made its debut, on a great kid's tv station. I feel sorry for anyone who didn't grow up in New York at that time and doesn't have the WPIX Yule Log registered in their Christmas memories. Thank you Mr. Arcuri for slamming down this impostor.",1248825600,4,299,4.2631578947368425
2106170,3,B0002MINTQ,I was expecting it to be a more close up shot of the fire (rather than including the entire fireplace in the frame).  I also was not expecting to see a fire-poker come into the picture.  Other than that it is what I was expecting.  It is relaxing and nice to watch.,1233100800,7,265,4.0576923076923075
2106171,5,B0002MINTQ,I was very happy to find this item.  It is most pleasant to listen to and view.,1202688000,,79,3.6470588235294117
2106172,5,B0002MINTQ,What an awesome dvd without the mess of wood and smoke.  As previous fireplace owners; we're in a new house without one; and miss it greatly. We can now enjoy the ambiance of a crackling fire to sleep by.  Thanks,1202428800,2,212,4.275
2106173,3,B0002MINTQ,"AS put, there is no original for sale as of yet. However the white cover boast original it isn't so. Its the outside of the fire place burning. The GREEN and RED ""Holiday Yule"" Is the inside of the fire place. There both good but neither DVDS are the original because there are no originals for sale as yet. As per my research. Cudos to the Holiday Yule though. I highly suggest you check with the other interviews first before purchasing.",1197504000,7,439,4.432098765432099
2106174,4,B0002MINTQ,I love this DVD.  It really puts me in the mood for the holidays.  I don't have a fireplace so it is a nice way to get that holiday feeling with a fire.,1195603200,4,152,3.5757575757575757
