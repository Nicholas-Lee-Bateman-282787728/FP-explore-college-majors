1834662,5,B00008DDGH,"I ordered severeal of these to show to my kids.  As we read each story I wanted to show them the movie behind it.  The kids enjoyed these very much and at a inexpensive cost, it is definitely worth it.  It's very engaging and can allow for much interaction with the kids.",1278028800,3,271,4.173076923076923
1834663,5,B00008DDGH,This is the second time I have purchased this video.  First time for grandchildren.  Now for my great grandchildren. The first one went through 5 grandchildren.,1271116800,3,160,5.115384615384615

1834665,4,B00008DDGH,"This DVD production of the Samson story has accomplished exactly what I had hoped for my 3yr old son: an interest in learning about the Lord and His involvement in the lives of those who trust Him.  My son often recites (in surprising detail) various scenes from the tale.  One of my fellow brothers in Christ calls my son ""The Little Preacher"" because my son enjoys capturing the attention of those around him so he can retell the story of Samson.  I understand some reviewing this telling of the story may prefer stricter adherence to various nuances and literary exactness from Scripture - I can appreciate that as I am a literal believer of Scripture.  There is never a perfect retelling of any Biblical story that will appeal to everyone's preference.  As already mentioned, this achieved what I had hoped for my son: help him develop an interest in learning about the Lord, building a faith in the Lord, and repentance and redemption.

My only criticism (hence the 4 out of 5 stars) is the characters on the cover look nothing like those in the actual film.  It's not a cataclysmic, don't buy the DVD issue - just annoying.",1191542400,2,1129,4.64321608040201
1834666,2,B00008DDGH,"This is a very, very strange rendering of the famous Bible story. Can't say I'm really a fan of the vindictive, punishing and violent Old Testament God, but whatever you think of the philosophy you've got to admit the stories from the book of Numbers are quite compelling and dramatic. Why bother doing them if you're not going to exploit the anger, vengeance and sensuality inherent in the original pieces? DeMille's film, for all its gaudy eroticism and ham-fisted spectacle at least honored the sensibilities and the grandeur of this story of sex and revenge. This version was so watered down that the climax (poorly rendered and badly drawn) had no impact. Clumsy animation (which looks not at all like the image on the box) and ill-conceived musical numbers practically sink this kid-friendly version of a powerful story. Too bad the filmmakers didn't trust their young audiences enough to know that children are capable of assimilating frightening imagery and messages: even ""The Wizard of Oz"" had some intense and disturbing scenes. This story could have used some. Charlton Heston's live action intro seems superfluous and bothersome. For a successful animated rendering of these Bible stories, I'd recommend ""The Prince of Egypt"" or ""Joseph, King of Dreams"". They're great examples of how this kind of thing can (and should) be done. This was a sadly wasted opportunity, and it's especially discouraging because this sweeping Biblical story was so well suited to the exaggerations and flourishes of the cartoon medium. Alas.",1132272000,11,1533,5.160642570281125

1834706,4,B00008DDGH,"Purchased for summer Sunday School. We decided to have a drive-in movie theater for summer and we are using these movies.
The kids love these movies they really get engaged with the movie. They ask questions and we are able to look the answers up in the Bible. Great series!",1404691200,,274,4.5
1834707,5,B00008DDGH,"My children love this movie.  We ordered several from this company, and they are nice for the price you pay.  They don't compare to the blockbuster The Prince of Egypt, but they relay the bible quite accurately, in a child-friendly manner.  The producers are also careful not to show violence too, if that's a concern for some parents.  You never see any bloodshed, or any weapon piercing someone.",1397606400,,397,4.794117647058823

1834712,4,B00008DDGH,"I showed portions of this to my Sunday school class.  It is mostly Biblical, so I actually would read through the Bible, then show a portion and ask them to raise their hands if they noticed items that weren't in the Bible or weren't correct.  All that being said, I am glad I purchased it and if properly reviewed and used, can be an additional part of your lesson.",1369526400,,366,4.2898550724637685
