8559109,4,B00AY6FT9M,"This is a good movie.  The acting is pretty good and the story is interesting and well written.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the film quality is pretty bad.  Though, considering that this is an independent film shot with little to no budget, it's not bad.  Worth checking out.",1455926400,,298,4.267857142857143
