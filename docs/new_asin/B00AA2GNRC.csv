8548893,3,B00AA2GNRC,"The information is good. The film has problems for those who do not understand German and Italian. The animated speakers, Mendelssohn and Wagner, are not helpful.",1425081600,,162,5.269230769230769
8548894,1,B00AA2GNRC,What a waste of money! A warning should have been given that the majority of narration and interviews are not in English.,1422835200,,121,4.545454545454546
8548895,3,B00AA2GNRC,"This was an interesting documentary - but I was hoping for so much more. I was a little tacky with letters read by people such as Wagner with an animated painted Wagner talking. Really odd. It was informative, but I was expecting my mind to be blown with a revelation of this composer who is significantly underrated. Interesting, informative... but only 60 minutes. MENDELSSOHN IS WORTH HOURS MORE!",1388620800,,399,4.882352941176471
