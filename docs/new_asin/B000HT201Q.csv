8141001,5,B000HT201Q,This pitching DVD has changed how my daughter pitch for the better. It has great mechanics drills and speed drills. It is very easy to go step by step and learn/improve skills.,1370995200,,176,4.53125
8141002,5,B000HT201Q,I have viewed this video (also purchased the book) and had my pitchers watch it.  I coach kids from beginners to high school and they all can utilize the drills in the book.  Great coaching tool even for those of us who have never pitched before.  The instructions were clear and easy to implement into my practice plan.  I think using both the book and video is more helpful than either one on it's own.,1303948800,,404,4.346666666666667
8141003,4,B000HT201Q,"My daughter has been pitching for less than a year and takes weekly pitching lessons from a pitching instructor.  This DVD is a nice supplement to the hands-on lessons and reinforces many of the same principles by allowing her to watch drills and pitches to understand the finer points of how the motions should look.  While we have just gotten started with the DVD, I also plan to video my daughter's pitching motion so that we can look at it in a side to side comparison with the DVD. It has also helped me as a dad to better understand the exact motions of drills, and to identify specific drills that will be helpful to my daughter.",1253836800,4,636,4.427350427350428
8141004,4,B000HT201Q,Really good if you want to teach yourself and can't afford or are not ready for a personal pitching coach.  Also is good for visualization for those who already have a personal coach and just would like to watch a pro.  Sherry Kempf is definitely a pro.,1252886400,,253,4.361702127659575
