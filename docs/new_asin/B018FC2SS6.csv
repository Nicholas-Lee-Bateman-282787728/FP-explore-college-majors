8742228,1,B018FC2SS6,"Well, for an uncut version of the movie visit Amazon.co.uk, but although cheap and luckily really short, don't expect to be entertained. This is besides a few decent kills run of the mill retro- slasher nonsense. Acting nonexistent, as is a script. Killer's looks are cool but wasted in this mediocre mess. Don't bother.",1487894400,,320,4.944444444444445
8742229,3,B018FC2SS6,"This is a Rene Perez's so bad its good film installment. Don't be confused, this in a one star or zero star film. I just thought it was so bad I got some enjoyment from it. A reality TV show takes 4 contestants to a mountain cabin where there is no cell phone service, except when the cell phone rings. There is a slasher up there and the last person standing stars in their own horror movie and that million dollar thing. I am not sure why someone wears a barbed wire guard around their head, seems a bit cumbersome at beddy-bye time. The film doesn't end with closure and director-writer-producer-etc.-etc. will certainly make another one. I am glad to see he is doing bad horror instead of bad fantasy films with idiotic flashbacks.
