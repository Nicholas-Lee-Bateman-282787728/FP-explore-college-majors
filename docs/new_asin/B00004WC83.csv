8213765,5,B00004WC83,"This is the very YOUNG Sutherland's voice (circa 1960-1968
  here). In those days La Stupenda is world renowned for having the clearest, most crystline voice in
  the world. She's Justly famous for having one the most beautiful voice around. Trill for trill, runs for
  runs, high notes for high notes, and staccato for staccato, she's unbeatable.
  For over 30 years she ruled the operatic heaven as the Queen of bel canto. I think that's the reason
  the Callas crowd has always hated her. It is so plainly obvious that Sutherland is vastly superior to
  Callas vocally and technically. And her emergence in 1959 as Lucia made La Stupenda the
  overnight toast of the operatic world and certainly help force the Greek diva into an early
  retirement - not wanting to be second best.
  This collection of the toughest bel canto arias sung by La stupenda sets the standards by which all
  other coloraturas who follow should and must be judged by.
  No one, and I repeat no one, past, present and in the future are likely to compare favorably to
  Sutherland's command of the art of coloratura singing, let alone come close to these definitive
  interpretations of these most taxing arias ever written.
  If you want to hear mind boggling, jaw dropping singing that epitomizes a vocal virtuosa, this is the
  DVD for you. For the shere beauty and possibilities of the human voice, this collection of bel canto
  warhorses is invincible.",1059004800,4,1436,4.805785123966942

Not a note out of place, unbeleivable coloratura. The only thing that can not be appreciated is the sheer size of the voice... no little peanut whistle sounds here. The Met Primma Donnas of today would do well to take a peak at this. They can't hold a candle to these performances.. BRAVO DAME JOAN!",992476800,16,451,4.567901234567901
