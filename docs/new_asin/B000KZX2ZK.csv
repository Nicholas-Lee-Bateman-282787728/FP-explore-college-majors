8159748,3,B000KZX2ZK,gooo. Beginning! for raising chicken,1404345600,,36,6.4
8159749,5,B000KZX2ZK,This is produced by professionals in the chicken world. There were very helpful tips and information that I had searched for but was unable to find anywhere else on trimming the spurs on a show chicken.  Very helpful.,1391385600,,217,4.7105263157894735
8159750,5,B000KZX2ZK,This is a great DVD for those planning to raise poultry.  I got this for my 4H Market Turkey Project as turkeys are similar in many ways to chickens (and I could not find a DVD for raising turkeys).  The sections are labeled clearly so it's an easy tool to use in any teaching situation.  It's well filmed and the audio is good.  It gives practical advice for anyone planning to raise and show chickens.,1233014400,,403,4.333333333333333
8159751,4,B000KZX2ZK,"I am currently getting ready to purchase my first flock of
chickens and I have read just about every poultry book I can
get my hands on!  The DVD literally shows you the basics
and makes it easier to see just what needs to be done.
There are sections on showing chickens for 4-H and tips on buying
good stock. Also, it graphically shows how to butcher chickens
when the time comes. That was hard to watch but really lets you
see what to expect. All-in-all, it was worth the money. I refer
back to it and the DVD has been very helpful.",1219622400,,534,4.184466019417476
8159752,2,B000KZX2ZK,"If you, like I, are looking for a detailed instruction for caring for poultry, and don't care very much about the rarefied world of show chickens, this is not the book for you.  It is spare on the basics that it proports to teach and seems to go on endlessly about the group itself that produced this film.",1211414400,2,306,4.275862068965517
8159753,5,B000KZX2ZK,"A beginner's Guide to Raising and Showing Chickens is very informative DVD. I highly recommend it for beginners or for the expierenced. It goes into detail about showing, showmanship, what birds are good to start out with, what birds you should choose for show and so much more. Even the butchering part is very helpful and educational. I love watching this DVD because every time I watch it seems I learn something new, I can't wait for the second edition! Great job!",1209081600,,468,4.719512195121951
8159754,5,B000KZX2ZK,Very informative. Enjoyed the cd. Gives you a good look into showmanship of your poultry. Also helpful info for raising poultry.,1187740800,,128,5.142857142857143
8159755,5,B000KZX2ZK,The DVD was exactly what I was looking for. It covers just about everything and will be very useful for my 4-H meetings. I was especially pleased with the showmanship segments. We have never done poultry showmanship in our county and have only had poultry 4-H for two years. I loved the way that you walked us through every step of the procerss and SHOWED us what to expect. I feel confiedent that I can have my kids ready for showmanship this year because of this video. Very well done!,1174608000,,487,4.4222222222222225
8159756,5,B000KZX2ZK,"Easy to use with various chapters.  You can get where you want to go right away! Recommended for a beginning poultry producer, FFA, or 4-H members.",1172275200,,147,4.653846153846154
