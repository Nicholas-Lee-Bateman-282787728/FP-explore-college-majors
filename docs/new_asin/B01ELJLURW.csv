I am glad I gave this a shot, and now suggest it to anyone who will listen. I just wish there were easier ways to get it in the USA. No movie has impacted me so strongly in a long time. It deals with some pretty heavy topics such as love and mental health, and does so well.",1527379200,,397,4.025316455696203
