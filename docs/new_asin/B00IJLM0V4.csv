6266220,5,B00IJLM0V4,"The Rev 4 video is a great addition to my workout library. Just when I thought I had seen every exercise there is, Natalie Jill surprised me with some refreshing new ones. I love the around the world and runner lunges, the walkouts and the shoulder twists from plank position. The video has separate segments for warm-up, full body, core, upper, lower, and cool down. This way I am able to customize my workout based on the time I have and how I feel that day. This video will also be great when I travel because the exercises use my body weight/resistance instead of weights. I love the variety of movements, with 30 seconds of each exercise rather than long and boring repetitions! Thank you Natalie Jill!",1407888000,4,707,4.574803149606299
6266221,5,B00IJLM0V4,"I am out of shape and overweight. Yes, these workouts are difficult. I do the best I can with them and can already feel myself progressing. I cant hold the plank for as long as Natalie Jill can but I am getting stronger. I LOVE that you use your own bodyweight for this video. It is challenging but doable. Go at your own pace, modify if u need to and you WILL see results!!!",1406419200,41,375,4.081081081081081

Thanks!",1405123200,2,35,6.2
6266224,5,B00IJLM0V4,I love the 10 minute segments.  I did the entire DVD today from warm-up through all four rev segments and the cool down.  This is a terrific workout DVD.  I highly recommend it.  She is great at giving the cues and she shows you how to do the moves before you actually do them.  I love her style.  She is tough and there is no equipment needed for the workout.  I really enjoyed every minute of the workout and i am going to be sore tomorrow so I know it is effective.,1402963200,18,468,4.021739130434782

6266228,5,B00IJLM0V4,Love love love Natalie Jill Rev 4! I have worked out so often to this DVD I am buying another one!! I have lost over 20lbs since I've been following her and also purchased her Building Abs and Total Bodyweight workout DVDs & also highly recommend them! I also love her DVDs bc she actually works out with you unlike Jillian Michaels whom works out a little then gets up and introduces one of her workout partners! I also enjoy Natalie's positive attitude which truly shines and her YouTube videos which are also great workouts and advice!!,1458086400,,539,4.56701030927835
6266229,5,B00IJLM0V4,"I absolutely love REV 4!!  These work outs.  Natalie is so motivating and teaches you how to do the exercises correctly so you get results.  You need no equipment for these workouts.  The workouts are broken up into 4 10 minute workouts, so you can do 1 10 minute workout for days you don't have a lot of time or you can do all 4 for a total body workout.  I love working with Natalie!!  I've lost 20 lbs and 22.5"" in 2.5 months following her fitness and nutrition plan.",1457568000,2,470,4.166666666666667

6266234,5,B00IJLM0V4,"I am so pleased that I purchased this DVD. My doctor recommended body weight exercises to help combat back and shoulder issues. I procrastinated and tried various exercise programs thinking it would resolve the issues. Then I got serious and began research for various body weight exercise options and found Natalie Jill. (I follow her on Facebook as well for added ideas) Believe me this workout will get your heart pumping and your body will know that you've been exercising. On day one, I could believe it. I was definitely sweating and muscles were shaky. It was much more than expected. My body can tell the difference! Yes, I have sore muscles but in a way that tells me that I am working the right muscles and strengthening my body. Natalie provides guidance on how to modify until you're able to complete the segments at the recommended level and positions. The program is not overly produced but nicely done. My goal was to have someone show me proper form and a bit of encouragement to keep me motivated. She focuses on all that along with exercising your mind. Your body can do it, don't let your mind tell you different - It really hit home. As I begin to make a bad choice on food options I stop to think about that and what my body will endure during exercise. So, to say the least, I am not disappointed and am going back to purchase the abs and advanced version! Bring it on!",1451692800,6,1391,4.5019762845849804
6266235,2,B00IJLM0V4,"Definitely for beginners and listening to her say ""rev it up!"" gets old fast. So weird. I'll stick to my T25 and Jillian Michaels DVDs.",1450310400,,135,4.44

6266237,3,B00IJLM0V4,Haven't tried the workouts so I will update once I do.. But I had to share because I was thoroughly disappointed in the packaging.. A piece broke off as soon as I opened the DVD and the whole top part was cracked..,1447977600,,214,4.119047619047619

6266240,3,B00IJLM0V4,I like Natalie's youtube channel and videos she posts on Facebook so I thought I'd try a video. It is pretty basic as far as videos go. I like her personality so some of the production stuff doesn't bother me so much. I was a little disappointed as I feel her content online is even better than this video. Many of the moves are not new or different. I get a better workout from 21 Day Fix or my older Jillian Michaels DVDs. A+ for personality and energy but lacking in a workout that would produce great results. This would be fine for the occasional exerciser wanting to tone a little. I wouldn't recommend it for weight loss.,1442966400,5,628,4.330508474576271

6266252,5,B00IJLM0V4,"I have to say...I like the workouts where I can determine how long I work out for. She has 4 different workouts, targeting different areas and you can do them all or pick which ones you want to do. You would think they aren't going to give you a very good workout because each segment is 10 minutes or less, but I am sweating within 2 minutes. I wished she had a lot more because it's hard for me to watch a Youtube video and then do an exercise. I really prefer having a DVD to follow.",1438300800,3,486,4.020618556701031

6266257,4,B00IJLM0V4,"I've really enjoyed learning new things from Natalie Jill. She is an inspiration and very motivational. I've been doing her workouts through her youtube channel for about 2-3 months then decided to order this dvd.

I am a mother of 3 and like most mother's, time is limited and you come up with every excuse as to why you can't take care of yourself, etc etc... well I started to take the plunge and care for myself first. It may sound selfish but when you've dedicated your life or at least 14 years of it to kids and your husband, I think that's explanatory enough. This dvd is great for moms who are on time limit, who don't want to bother with weights, who wants something that will actually work.  There are 4 segments and a warm up and cool down. Each segment lasts 10 minutes each sans warm\cool down.  Great thing about this video is you can choose what part of your body you want to work or you can do the whole dvd.

You have to realize you will not be able to do some of these movements maybe due to an issue you have or like most, your core is not strong. If you slowly build up your core you will see a difference. Just don't give up if you can't keep up. Going at your own pace is better than no pace at all.  Everyone is always looking for a quick fix and people these days are not use to patience. Hard work and effort will get you where you want to be!! Natalie Jill will get you in the best body you deserve and the tools to do it but you have to work for it.  Highly recommend this dvd.",1435536000,9,1505,4.084745762711864

The exercises are great for the body.  She knows what she is talking about!  For someone who doesn't have much time, you will get a great workout.  The quality of her exercises are what I prefer the most as for once in a long time, I am starting to see results. No heavy equipment or gyms....only use body weight, the best way to go.  Natalie is also very motivating and she understands the challenges we face.  When you will see your body changing, it just makes you want to work harder and harder.

As of now I can hold a plank for 3 minutes now and will just keep going for longer :). The music does not go with the work outs- loud then soft, think the production could of been better- sound & visually as sometimes did not get the full view of the steps. Honestly would just prefer her doing the workouts and cheering you on with no music..Took a while to get used to Natalie (I like her very much now)  the work outs def get results if you stick with them along with eating well. JUST STICK WITH IT!!! I will check out her next DVD because I have had such good results along with eating well and plenty of cardio & strength training.",1430697600,,735,4.068965517241379

I feel like I get a lot more out of the 30 Day Shred by Jillian Michaels and Jackie Warner's Power Circuit Training DVD. I purchased this DVD for about $20 including shipping, but the other two were half that price and I return to them over and over with excellent results. I like Natalie Jill personally, but this workout is not right for me. Not sure if I'll continue doing this one or not.",1423785600,5,463,4.2727272727272725

I was very sore the next day but no pain, no gain -- it's clear Natalie targets specific areas and muscles to work on. I expect these workout routines to be effective.",1423353600,,345,4.088235294117647

6266331,5,B00IJLM0V4,"This was a great quick workout! I love body weight training, and these workouts really helped me focus on my technique and I love that weights or bands can be added to many of the exercises! First do the warm-up which primes every major muscle group for movement, then choose one of the four workouts Total Body, Lower Body, Upper Body, or Core Crusher! Every workout works the core, which is important for doing day-to-day tasks! These workouts would be great for hotel rooms or small apartments. Natalie tells you which muscles your focusing one, and combines compound moves such as squats and/or pushups and/or planks with a couple of isolation moves to maximize the amount of calories burned in a short workout. The cool down uses static stretching to improve range of motion and prevent injury. Natalie is also very warm and walks you through modifications for more advanced or beginners! She also includes injury prevention tips in a bonus segment. I would definitely say this dvd has something to challenge everyone, and I will definitely be using it again and again!  I will definitely be using these workouts to get me through the holidays and beyond!",1416787200,5,1160,4.858585858585859
6266332,5,B00IJLM0V4,Love Love this DVD!! I use hand and ankle weights to make it more intense.  I've completed the entire 45 min workout every time....highly recommend getting this DVD!!!,1416700800,2,167,4.964285714285714

6266334,5,B00IJLM0V4,These are effective quick and fun workouts.  This is like having a coordinated workout incorporating the best of the body weight exercises.  Natalie is a great trainer and si likeable.  Check out her Internet workouts as well.  She had a cue dog that sometimes gets in on the action.  Lol. Well well worth the money.,1415664000,25,316,4.672727272727273

6266338,5,B00IJLM0V4,"What I like:
The short segments.
It's only Natalie Jill.  (I don't need to feel like I'm in a class)
The video is easy to follow.
It's a DVD! So easy to pop in...computer, DVD player...No wifi needed.
Great for travel. Don't need a lot of space or equipment. Do it outside.
She has SO many other resources to help you. Pin her, follow her, tube her....
It's $20.
As other reviewers said..easy to knock out in the morning, and you feel great after.

Buy it.",1415664000,14,456,4.290697674418604
6266339,5,B00IJLM0V4,I bought this DVD for the days I'm in a pinch and want to get a super blast workout in a short period of time. This REV4 does it all. Feel like a Rock Star when I'm finished and ready to start my day!,1415664000,,200,3.5681818181818183
6266340,5,B00IJLM0V4,"Great workout dvd..no excuses bc it's set up in 10 minute intervals, learned quite a few new things and moves and that's a major plus in my book",1415664000,,144,4.178571428571429
6266341,5,B00IJLM0V4,Looking forward to Rev4 and any other videos that come out!  I'm a long-time user of many Natalie Jill programs and they never disappoint.,1415664000,,138,4.75
6266342,4,B00IJLM0V4,"Its a great DVD for people who want to get in shape but don't have hours upon hours to work out.  There are 4-10 minute segments, a full body, upper body, lower body and core crusher along with a nice warm up and a cool down with some bonus features.  On a day I have limited time I do the warm up, one 10 minute segment and the cool down but on days when I have more time I do several together.  There are modifiers for those not fully able to do the more advanced exercises but I found all her workouts pretty do-able.  I have used other DVDs like Jillian Michaels who have really intense shorter workouts but don't really explain the movements well leading to improper form and injury.  I really like how she explains the moves and focuses on body weight training, no need for anything outside of your own body to get a good workout.  Thumbs up!",1415664000,26,848,4.236024844720497

6266345,5,B00IJLM0V4,"I LOVE Natalie Jill and all the Bodyweight exercises she comes up with that are easy to follow and modify if needed!  These are short workouts and to do one is not enough for me so I will do 3 or all 4 for a complete session leaving me feel amazing!  Who doesn't have 30-40 minutes?  As Natalie would say, Excuses or Solutions?  You Decide. She offers a great solution in this DVD ;)",1415577600,2,383,4.135135135135135

6266347,5,B00IJLM0V4,"The ten minute segments are perfect for me. I'm a working mom so I can squeeze in a different segment (plus warm up and cool down) each morning. I would never have thought of such a short workout being so effective. This is something that I can stick with to achieve my fitness goals. As others have said, these workouts are challenging but doable. As Jill says, where your mind goes, your body will follow!",1415577600,,407,4.44

I have been doing these workouts since September and I really notice a difference in my body.",1415577600,,361,4.492307692307692
6266350,5,B00IJLM0V4,The best home video out there! The push-ups are really challenging and if you're advanced it's easy to add dumbells! Natalie's personality is encouraging as she asks you at the end of each segment if you want to continue. Excuses or solutions you decide-it always pushes me to do the next ten minute segment!,1415577600,3,308,4.722222222222222

Looking forward to future DVD's",1415577600,,372,4.485294117647059
6266353,5,B00IJLM0V4,Excellent and challenging workout. I'm using it to recover from a broken pelvis and arm laceration and using body weight as a strengthening exercise is where it's at. Still a long way to go but Natalie provides solid modifications for challenging moves. Excuses or solutions!,1415577600,9,275,5.133333333333334

8642612,4,B00IJLM0V4,"Because I have been working out for years and get sick of the same old things, I'm always open to new workouts. I thought this one might be too easy because each one is only about 10 minutes. The first day I tried the warm up, total body, and arms. I have to say, I felt it for 2 days! Great workout. Didn't really seem like it when I was doing it, but the proof was how I felt. I must say, the quality of the video kind of seems like it came from the internet. And, it's just Natalie Jill standing by herself in a sterile white room with a shades of purple backdrop covered in motivational words. Kind of bothered me at first. However, that being said, she gives a great workout with moves I have never done (which probably explains why I felt it over the next days). Overall, this is totally worth adding to your library. Looking forward to working into my routine each week.",1510617600,,877,4.195266272189349

8642615,5,B00IJLM0V4,"LOVED this work out - pretty decent music, she is spot on her form and doesn't do all that cheesy talk you get from some of these DVDs.  I do all 4 sessions and I am sweating by the end of it.  I do have to modify slightly but she gives you directions on how to do that as needed.

8642617,5,B00IJLM0V4,"Natalie Jill is an amazingly fit woman who has earned her stripes in the fitness world!  She is a great example of how we can push and mold ourselves into the body of our dreams if we apply consistency and commitment with our food and our workouts.  Her workouts don't require you to buy anything but the DVD and get started.  Are the workouts easy? Hell no!  Will they challenge you and muscles you didn't realize you had...absolutely!  If you keep in mind that you WILL NOT master these exercises in two weeks but will grow stronger with each workout you will reap the benefits from her workouts and find yourself looking and feeling better sooner than you think.  The great thing is that Natalie Jill has not been statuesque all of her life.  She had to work hard to look the way she does...the same way you and I do.  No magic pills here!

I would say that this workout is intermediate.  If you are new to working out I recommend this DVD after you've built up some cardio stamina.  Good luck and keep it fun!",1467417600,,1013,4.363636363636363
