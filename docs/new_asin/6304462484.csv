884628,5,6304462484,"Wow... I finished watching this episode mere moments ago, and i think my brain has turned into Jello. It takes a long time before you realize that no there will be no more than a vague plotline throughtout the entire  ""film"". Random Scene changes, serious continuity problems(day  night day night day night afternoon...), and a complete abscence of  intelligble dialogue, combine to make this film completely unwatchable.  Eventually it reaches the point where as Servo says "" the movie seems  to have just thrown up it's hands and given up on the plot"" If it  weren't for superb riffs from the satelite of love gang, i think i might  have had to go to the bathroom and evacuate my stomach. If you have ever  heard the legend of Coleman Francis and want a great example of his  complete lack of talent watch this film, watch it anyway because the  comments are hilarious.  However don't plan to do anything requiring brain  wave activity for a few hours afterwards... As Crow says ""aside from  never being able to experience joy again"" and "" I can never harm  this movie the way it has harmed me"" Amen...",951696000,,1104,4.623711340206185
884629,5,6304462484,"This is one film you would never sit through without Tom, Crow and Mike along. As Mr Badmood says below, it is incredibly incompetent in just about every category. Which only makes the riffing -- some of the most inspired  of the Mike era -- more welcome. Watch it with someone you love, and you'll  find yourselves trading quips -- 'Oh, he's good in anything' -- for days.  If you buy just ONE MST video, buy Mitchell. If you buy two, get Red Zone  Cuba. (Anyone else find it strange that the two most inspired episodes of a  program called Mystery SCIENCE Theater are a bad cop flick and a war  movie?)",947376000,4,604,4.348214285714286
884630,5,6304462484,"I wholeheartedly agree with assertions that Coleman Francis was a far worse writer/director than Ed Wood.  Say what you want about Mr. Wood, he could at least employ dialogue that allowed for character development and  develop a relatively cohesive plot. Indeed, Red Zone Cuba is a horrible  movie, and yet I feel strangely drawn to it because I am baffled as to why  CF thought such a tale deserved screen time.  I can only surmise that  Francis thought it remarkable that the bay of pigs invasion relied heavily  on government-backed militants and Free Cuba activists who didn't care  where the men they recruited came from; they just needed warm bodies on the  front line.  Ex-cons and luckless drifters like the two desperadoes with  the escaped con Griffin were almost certainly among their numbers.  Dull  plot, virtually absent dialogue, and bleak landscapes notwithstanding, what  makes Red Zone Cuba a really terrible movie is that it just isn't focused  at all.  One might think with a $30,000 budget, Francis would confine the  story more directly to the Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba. Ideally, the movie  might have ended with the trio's escape and more time and effort would have  gone into developing a cohesive plot and general film statement.  Instead,  the film packs on forty extra pitiful minutes AFTER the escape when the  three pillage and loot their way West to cheat a widow out of a hardly  credible 'mine'.  Why bother?  Wasn't, as Crow stated, this movie supposed  to be about Cuba? Herein lies the paradox of the movie: was it about the  Bay of Pigs invasion force, or was it about a vile escaped con called  Griffin, who 'ran all the way to hell?'  Was the story extended into a tale  of Griffin's last days because, perhaps, Francis' ego wasn't assuaged by  the quantity of screen time he got? Or am i just reading way too much into  the whole damn thing? I feel fortunate to have seen the movie, and grateful  to Best Brains for having softened the blow of the second worst movie I  have ever seen.  I didn't like this particular MST the first time i saw it,  but it seems to have garnered a special place in my heart now.  I recommend  this comically revamped film as a thinkpiece as well as a classic MST3K  episode.",941673600,6,2247,4.649616368286445
884631,5,6304462484,"The Mst3k Episode Guide says it best: ""This movie is little more than a series of still photos that amount to a flipbook.""  Who is (or was)  Coleman Francis, and what the hell was he thinking when he decided to make  this film?  Well, actually, I'm glad he did, or wouldn't have this hour and  a half of hilarity. This is one of the best Mike episodes of the series,  and I recommend it whole-heartedly.  Is there anyone else out there  who would like to see these MST episodes released on DVD, with the added  bonus of being able to watch both the MST version and the original non-MST  version?

884632,3,6304462484,"I can not imagine how anyone could sit though a screening of this one without an MST-filter. Honestly - people who claim that ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" is the worst movie ever made are dilettantes. They simply  do not KNOW the depths below Ed Wood that this movie, and the other  ""films"" made by Coleman Francis, reach. If I had only two hours  left to live, this opus would help make those 120 minutes SEEM like an  eternity. It's really hard to convey how LONG you feel you've been sitting  there - time stands still while you are subjected to a totally  incomprehensible mishmash. Highlights include ""willowy"" John  Carradine ""singing"" (""croaking"" would be a more  accurate description) the title tune ""Night Train to Mondo Fine""  (an experience that will reverbrate through your conciousness the way  certain meals visit you for hours after consumption), a trip to a Cuba that  seems to be in the middle of a lake and is ruled by a Castro with an  obvious fake beard, neck-snapping edits that leave any hope of following  the plot in the dust, and a finale that leaves you wondering if you have  actually seen a movie or somehow inadvertantly ingested some bizarre  hallucinogen and are only now coming back to consciousness. Try to imagine  the high production values of ""Carnival of Souls"" blended with  the comedic talents of J. Edgar Hoover, all washed with the sunny visions  of a Cornell Woolrich on downers. Nahhhh, it just isn't possible to  describe. THIS one has to be seen to be believed. My biggest regret - you  don't get a medal to wear that says, ""I sat through ALL of ""RED  ZONE CUBA"" and lived to tell the tale!!""

Mike Nelson and the bots however make an otherwise unwatchable film hilarious. The common Colman Frances motiff of coffee is frequently used in the dialog.

884683,5,6304462484,"This is one of my favorite MST3K efforts.  Coleman Francis (director/actor) and Mystery Science Theater were made for each other.

For those not familiar with Coleman Francis, imagine that a below average ability truck driver is drafted to produce, star in, and direct a Hollywood movie.  I give you . . . Coleman Francis.

Story:  Mercenary soldiers (all 7 of them) executing an invasion of Cuba.  Wonderfully bad . . . the premise, the training scenes, the fighting, the captivity, the escape.  I thought MST3K got caught napping when they didn't comment on the ridiculous scene where the group of ""POWs"" finally beg a small tin cup of water for their wounded dying colleague who keeps asking for it.  Then all 3 of them drink out of the cup before passing the dregs over to the dying guy.

If you enjoy this ridiculous excuse for a movie, then may I also recommend, Mystery Science Theater - The Skydivers.  Coleman Francis at his pinnacle, and absolutely hilarious as a MST3K vehicle.",1189987200,,988,4.758823529411765
884684,5,6304462484,"This is one of those movies you kind of feel bad about laughing at, but you just can't help it.  Its so unintentionally funny!  I love it!  I can laugh at the voice of the guy saying, ""Water, thirsty, sick man,"" for hours and hours!  And the viciously botched editing transitions that are patented Coleman Francis are just so memorable that I cherish them.

In what other movie can you develop a deep admiration for a guy named Cherokee Jack simply because of how goofy his voice sounds when he woodenly says his name?  Red Zone Cuba is a MST3K episode that has a kind of inexplicable magic that produces this kind of illogically emotional response.  You end up loving things you shouldn't love, just because they're so bland.  Like Coleman's dirt in the drainpipe story.

I don't know what makes Coleman's movies different from other awful and completely unlovable bland movies like Screaming Skull, but something about it is different.  Instead of causing pain like Stranded in Space, the awful qualities of this film bring sheer delight.  Too bad every terrible movie can't do this.",1183593600,,1085,4.779569892473118
884685,4,6304462484,"Do you remember how TV stations used to flash up a picture of a baby entangled in 16mm film, when the station was having ""technical difficulties""?  Well, I think that the remnants of that mess were spliced together and given the title ""Red Zone Cuba.""

The giddy three, in their seats of scoffers, never had it so easy as with this absurd compilation of disjointed shlock!  I still crack up at the comment ""hmmm, these close-up shots must have saved them a lot of money on sets!""  And, ""I don't know much about executions, but wouldn't it be better if they shot more than one prisoner at a time?""  And late in the ""movie"" (cough!! gag!!), they ask each other which of the movie's open issues still need to be resolved.  Yeah right!  Go ahead and get more popcorn -- you won't miss a thing!

Please fasten your safetybelt, because you will lurch from location to location with absolutely no warning.  Fear not that the plot will confuse you, because there is no plot.  There are no good guys, just bad camera angles.  And please please do not rewind to try to hear what one of the characters just muttered.  If you do that, you will only prolong your agony.

Somebody must have held John Carradines entire family held at GUN POINT to make him do this. ""I'm Cherokee Jack!"" I'm expecting some hardened bush pilot and this is what chirps out of his mouth. And why would you even GET on a plane when the pilot advertises 'We FLIE anywhere"" Or maybe they flew NOwhere since the scenery never changed. The editing must have been done by a schizophrenic with ADD, and I never DID find the plot!

They take his car, drive,-the scenery never changed-dump it, hop a train-the scenery still hadn't changed when they got off the train.

The wonderfully bad Coleman Francis film makes perfect fodder for Mike and the bots. From the opening tones of the John Carradine sung theme, to the last Beast-of-Yucca-Flats-like helicopter rundown at the end, Red Zone Cuba is a riot. When Mike and the bots start making Curly of the 3 Stooges references at Coleman, through the inept guerilla training sequences, to the invasion of Cuba.....this is just one of the funniest episodes of the show. I know some folks get caught up in the Joel vs. Mike, or Comedy Central vs. Sci-Fi thing....who cares? This one-of-a-kind show is sorely missed in today's reality TV/King of Queens/According to Jim world, and no matter which episode you pop in you are guaranteed a good laugh with MST3K.

884689,5,6304462484,"It just struck me, the ongoing verbal critique of the MST 3000 panel aside: If this movie were remade today with an identical script, but; If its locale was changed to Iraq in the year 2003; If slightly more production values were invested in it, and; If it was entered in the Sundance and Cannes film festivals as an ""independent production,""  critics around the world would hail it for its ""deeply symbolic subtext"" and call it a ""cautionary anti-war tale, told through a surrealist's lens.""

I'll place a bet on that one, dollars to donuts!

It is just unfortunate that Coleman Francis suffered the unjust fate of making movies in an age when incompetence was called by its rightful name.

With the right PR firm and slick advertising, he'd be a pretentious multi-millionaire ""auteur"" these days!",1095206400,14,799,4.852941176470588
884700,4,6304462484,"Devotees of Coleman Francis (we know who you are -- we have the names) will know that not all of his films benefitted from ""synched"" sound.  Watch ""Beast from Yucca Flat"" carefully, and you'll see that all the dialgue is ""looped"", or recorded after the fact.

Sync sound brings a new dimension of awfullness to this work.  Coleman and the cast mumble and stumble through their lines; if you turn your TV up to the threshold of pain, you might pick up some extra nuances from the soundtrack, but I doubt it.

The skill of the sound department is more than matched by that of the camera department.  The film appears to have been run through an airport x-ray machine several dozen times (no doubt looking for WMD.) Black and white is pretty forgiving, but not of gross incompetence.

Anyhow, as with ""Wild World of Batwoman"", don't try to figure it out  -- just open the wine, and let the waves wash over you as you laugh out loud.  Rest assured that Mike and the 'bots give it the full treatment, each insult richly deserved.",1089072000,4,1024,4.4972972972972975
884701,5,6304462484,"Though the film is up there with Manos in sheer, unfettered badness, it only makes the send-up by Mike and the Bots that much more enjoyable. The writer of the original film apparently forgot to make his anti-hero protagonists have some kind of redeeming characteristics.
As a result, we don't care what happens to them. The original film is also a collection of what they told you not to do in film school: it's badly shot, the scenes drag on because the editing isn't fast enough and there's no dramatic action in them, the audio isn't recorded well, and just about the only thing cinematically interesting is the devastated landscape of New Mexico.
Though the film is designed to be a ""war film"", it doesn't feel like much of one due to the limited budget. When your raiding force consists of 6 extras, expect Mike and the Bots to laugh uproariously.
The comedy dialogue by Mike and the Bots is hilarious. From pointing out the director/main actor's more-than-passing resemblance to Curly to turning into Carol Channing due to the bad power of the film, you'll be chuckling at this. This is up there with MANOS and Mitchell.",1088985600,5,1127,4.725888324873097
884702,5,6304462484,"Some of the best MST3K episodes focus on films that have the Cold War as its subject (Invasion USA, e.g.)or when the entire production team takes itself so damned seriously (Cave Dwellers). In RED ZONE CUBA, Mike and the 'bots have the best of both worlds. A jailbreak movie that turns into a ""road movie"" that turns into commie-baiting, Cold War paranoia movie, RED ZONE CUBA must have been a field day for Mike and the other writers. For that reason alone, this skewering would rank among my top ten favorite episodes. But it's also the ""bumper"" scenes between commercial breaks that are a riot here.

884703,5,6304462484,"This DVD of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" offer up the movie ""Red Zone Cuba"" (which was originally released under the title ""Night Train to Mundo Fin""). This awful, incomprehensible, and completely bizarre 1961 film (re-released in 1965) made for one the greatest episodes of the show. This is classic comedy, a must-have for fans, and a must-see for anyone who has never watched an episode of this hysterical TV program.
For those of you unfamiliar with ""Mystery Science Theater 3000,"" (MST3K for short) it is a ninety-minute show featuring a silhouette of a man and two robots in movie theater seats projected in front of a terrible movie. The hosts provide side-splitting, satiric, and culturally-savvy wisecracks to accompany the movie. Each episode also includes sketches and songs and adds up to some of the most hilarious comedy you will ever see.
This DVD offers up episode #619, from late in the show's run on Comedy Central. Mike Nelson had been the host for a full season at this point, and he had really hit his stride with his two robot co-hosts (Tom Servo, voiced by Kevin Murphy, and Crow T. Robot, voiced by Trace Beaulieu). The riffing is razor sharp and wickedly biting, and ""Red Zone Cuba"" is possibly the best Mike Nelson episode of all time.
This is the second of three movies from director Coleman Francis that MST3K took on. Thanks to his exposure on the show, Mr. Francis has become a bad-movie legend on the level of Ed Wood. But Coleman Francis's flicks make Ed Wood's look like Stanley Kubrick movies by comparison! Coleman Francis was originally a bit-part movie actor, appearing in many Westerns and other b-programmers in the 40s and 50s. He decided to take a crack at movie directing himself, and along with his producer/drinking buddy Anthony Cardoza, crafted three mind-numbingly horrendous yet startlingly bizarre films: ""The Skydivers,"" (available in DVD the collection: ""Mystery Science Theater 3000, Vol. 1), this movie, and ""The Beast of Yucca Flats"" (not on DVD, but it should be some day).
Francis's films have a weird atmosphere: bleakly washed-out gray, packed with scenes of cars approaching, planes landing, people walking, bursts of sound and silence, and plots that are impossible to follow. The acting, from Francis's buddies like Tony Cardoza, is so wooden as to be unbelievable (third grade Christmas pageants have better acting), and the characters are so inexplicably bizarre and the editing so blunt (""I think my neck just got snapped in that jump cut!"" Mike screams at one point) that his films seems to take place in another universe. In the hands of the MST3K team, his movies achieve a level of sublime comic entertainment.
""Red Zone Cuba"" is Francis's finest (in other words, worst) hour. A runaway convict named Griffin (played by the greasy, obese Mr. Francis himself) joins two drifters, Landis and Cook, somewhere in New Mexico. They fly down to Florida (which looks like New Mexico) to join the Bay of Pigs invasion. It fails because the U.S. only hires eight insurgents and gives them twenty minutes of training in how to jump before unleashing them on Cuba. Imprisoned in Cuba (which looks like New Mexico), Griffin and his buddies stage a daring escape, fly all the way to...New Mexico, I guess...and then stuff a guy down a well, find a mountain of pitch blend, have trouble with a convertible top...
Well look, your guess is as good as mine as to what in the heck is going on in this film. I can't really describe what a wonderful experience this movie is with the MST3K team heckling along. Oh, and did I mention John Carradine pops up in a cameo and actually sings? Because he does! The film eventually drives Mike Nelson insane, and he thinks he's Carol Channing.
As a bonus, the MST3K boys watch a short film before the movie, ""Speech: Platform Posture and Appearance,"" designed to help the salesman of the 50s present a speech effectively by putting his hands on his knees and rotating them. (I'm not kidding.) As with most short films on MST3K, this one is hilarious.
If you are new to MST3K, this is one of the best episodes to start with - it's as funny as they come! If you are fan, this is one of the MUST HAVES of the whole series run. But you already know that, Cherokee Jack!",1078444800,11,4256,4.776119402985074
884704,5,6304462484,"Ah, Coleman Francis, what would we do without you? Well, for starters we wouldn't sit through Red Zone cuba,  a truly horrendous film directed by and starring Mr. Francis himself. This movie features three cons who get recruited into an invasion of cuba/New Mexico. The sheer badness of this film must be seen to be believed, the acting is bad but the editing was worse. There are scenes that make no sense, such as the scene where two of the cons try and put up a convertable top, endless talky scenes, and about 20 minutes of training for the invasion. After the failed invasion the cons escape and search for a  tungsten mine with the wife of one of their fellow invaders Sgt. Justine (Chastain). The film leads off with John Carradine and a young journalist, (""Kid looks like a reporter from the Catholic Digest"" Servo) and features a guy named Cherokee Jack,(""I'm Cherokee Jack!"") a diner owner and his blind daughter,(""she's been blind sense her husband was killed in the war."") coffee,(""Ah, coffee a Coleman Francis staple"") light planes,(""Look peanuts aren't important just pick one!"") a junkyard owner and his young daughter(father:take this to the house MTB(as daughter): What house?, MTB(as father)the blue Chevy MTB(as daughter):oh""  and a police chase at the end.(""Griffin.

884707,4,6304462484,"Some important people in Hollywood obviously lost some bets; that is the only way I can possibly rationalize the fact that someone let Coleman Francis write, direct, and star in this incredibly lousy movie.  Francis lumbers through this movie like a zombie-a very lazy zombie.  His penchant for close-ups is probably explained by a desire to show as little of the set as possible.  He doesn't even bother about making smooth transitions between scenes; he just cuts each one off and jumps immediately to the next one.  Of course, bad movies make for great Mystery Science Theater 3000 experiments, and this is no exception.  While Mike and the Bots add a lot of humor to the viewing of Red Zone Cuba, even they are powerless to mute its incredibly boring and bewildering effects on the viewer.  When the best part of the movie is John Carradine's singing, you are in trouble.  Carradine also apparently lost a large bet; unlike everyone else in this movie, he at least has at least a semblance of a reputation in the industry, and his ""guest appearance"" is totally unimportant and generally unexplainable.
Here's what might be the plot if Red Zone Cuba had one.  Coleman Francis' character has apparently broken out of prison, and he ends up tagging along with two of the most uninteresting characters you would ever meet.  When you are on the outs, running from the law, and in need of money very badly, where do you go?  Why, to a secret training camp where a handful of men are planning to invade Cuba and take up where the Bay of Pigs invasion failed, of course.  Much to the frustration of our three heroes, they are not actually paid up front the thousand dollars they are expecting, and after training for about a day (it's hard to tell because night and day change continuously and look pretty much alike), they're off to Cuba.  For a second, it looks like the invading forces (all seven of them) stand a chance-there can't be more than 10 Cubans there to oppose them (including a fellow with the worst Castro [imitation] beard you will ever want to see).  Despite being captured and never attempting to flee through the incredibly big hole in the wall of their ""prison,"" the trio somehow make their way back to the States (presumably, but all of the locations look alike) and try to go legit-the key word here is try.
There are some quite funny bits by the guys on the Satellite of Love.  Mike, Crow, and Tom Servo are hilarious as they begin the show pretending to be rich, smarmy, pompous gamblers.  Halfway through the movie, Mike begins to think he is Carol Channing, thus providing Crow with a golden opportunity to do his wonderful Carol Channing impersonation.  There is a short before the film, but it is quite forgettable; posture was seemingly all the rage in the 1950s, and this little film seems to argue that, when giving a speech, how you look is more important than what you say (let me clarify the fact that this is not the famous ""plenty of lip and tongue action"" short on how to give a speech).  For me, the funniest moment of the whole movie has nothing to do with Mike and the Bots-one of the characters says that his daughter has been blind ever since her husband was killed in the war.  What?  Oh, man, they just don't write movies like this anymore-or if they do, moviemakers have enough sense not to film them.",1039996800,29,3343,4.588235294117647

884721,2,6304462484,"INTRO:  To start off, I like MST3K a lot...so don't get the impression that I'm just bad-mouthing something that I have no idea what it is.  MST3K has come up with some really funny skits over the years, but this isn't really one of them.  The movie itself is stupid, yes...THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE IT!!  To honestly rate this DVD based on the movie included is just plain dumb, but to rate how much ""comedy"" the MST3K trio comes up with is a step up.  Unfortunately, this isn't Mike, Crow, and Servo's episode to shine.  The funny stuff doesn't come until the end (and some sprinkled parts of the movie), but I guess I can forgive this since this show has a lot of episodes and it can only come up with so much.
DVD:  ...  No extras, no original version of the movie like some of the other DVDs...no nothing really.  The only thing this DVD has going for it is menus, and they aren't even bad...which goes to show you what a little effort would have achieved.
OVERALL:  Overall, with a little more extras, I could have forgave this DVD.  Sadly, with only a bad movie, and some shredded comedy bits for this one, it wasn't enough to save it.  Fortunately, there are better MST3K DVDs out there.  I would only recommend this DVD if you are a hardcore fan (like me) of MST3K and you don't mind ""no extras"" on your DVD.  Also, if you don't mind that Mike and Co. don't always come up with as good of comedy as their writers...err....they're capable of.",1030752000,2,1445,4.343283582089552

884723,5,6304462484,"Here is yet another example of an excellent non-science fiction MST3K episode.
Here's the deal:
After an opening credit sequence featuring John Carradine belching out the theme song, Coleman Francis stars as Griffin, an escaped felon who teams up with two illegal tire-changers named Cook and Landis.  After they bond over beans and coffee, the trio decide to join up with the local army to invade Cuba.  They hire a rather uncharismatic fellow named Cherokee Jack (""I'm Cherokee Jack"") to fly them to the military base.  After the absolute worst training session in history, which consisted of wrestling, climbing a rope and jumping off a cliff, the impressive force leave for Cuba.  The riveting beach landing scene is a close second to Saving Private Ryan's as far as intensity goes (uhhh...not really).  As the invasion force of 8 guys gets picked off one by one by the Cubans, led by a faux-Castro in the worst fake beard of all time, Griffin, Cook and Landis are captured along with their injured ""friend"" Sergeant Justine (Chastain, actually).  They have to spend time in a little shack with ""Viva Cuba"" scrawled on the wall (so you know it's really Cuba), and all the while watch their fellow soldiers get paint thrown in their faces.  After an ingenius plan to strangle the guard that gives them a bowl full of water, the guys escape and fly in a plane back to good ole US of A, leaving Justine behind.  When they get back home, they track down Justine's wife, who rather naively gives them directions to and offers to help them with the plunder of the family's tungsten mine.  Cook and Landis are captured by the cops, Griffin and Mrs. Justine are shot, and Justine himself makes a triumphant return, only to find his dead wife in the back of a pick-up truck.  A dark, dark movie, is this one.
I really love Mike and Bots treatment of this one.  It is so disjointed and mistake-riddled, that it must be hard to sit through, but somehow they manage it, and make it my favorite episode in the process.  Much like Mitchell, I think the fact that the main characters are so loathsome, that the writers cruelty was unfettered.  A true classic.",1024012800,18,2148,4.665782493368701

There have been episodes funnier, and faster-paced: (""The Pod People"", ""I Accuse my Parents"", ""Eegah"" and ""Wild World of Batwoman"",) but ""Red Zone Cuba"" is one of my very favorites. The lively MST3K wit simply overpowers this sullen film, making this slow-burn hilarious.
The actual film is astonishingly cheap & cynical exploitation, one of the most sorry dogs you'll ever see. It's ugly to even look at. In 1963, the USA tried to overthrow Fidel Castro's Cuban regime,  with embarassing failure. Writer/""star""/ Director(!?!) Coleman Francis sniffed a quick buck. But Coleman's movie of historical events is really a springboard for the stories he REALLY wanted to tell. Firing squads, blind women, neck-snapping, infected wounds, plane-hijacks, line-cooks thrown down the backyard well, and assault by bike chain. Charming. MST3K get it right - using humor to deflate a seriously mean film. They do it well, you should see this one. Recommended for the strong, Jimmy Carter should be grateful Fidel Castro sent him ""Scarface"" gangsters and not this evil film.",1022371200,,1138,5.252747252747253
884725,4,6304462484,"This episode of MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 opens with a short film before the main feature.  The short in question is an instructional film about how to maintain proper posture while speaking in public.  Without a doubt this is the funniest short feature that I have ever seen them tackle.  Even if the heckling crew of the Satellite of Love had kept perfectly silent while this ran, I would still have been convulsed in laughter.  I can't even describe how unbelievably goofy this is, so you're just going to have to watch it for yourself.
The main feature, RED ZONE CUBA, is a bizarrely structured mess of a film.  It starts off with a prison escape sequence where an outlaw manages to evade some cops, then it jumps straight into a unfathomable seven-man invasion of Cuba (complete with fake-bearded Castro!) and then tries to settle down into a wacky treasure hunt.  There may have been some other genre jumps in there, but I couldn't follow enough of the film to be sure.  If not for that fearless group of three shadows in the lower right corner of the screen, there would be nothing tying this movie together.
All this incoherent madness gives our metallic and fleshy friends on the Satellite of Love quite a lot to make fun of.  The main character looks like an evil cross between Leo McKern and Curly Howard, and the MST3K crew don't miss a single opportunity to let loose with Three Stooges sound effects.  Not a single aspect of this woeful film escapes their attention, from the lame storyline to the hilarious reuse of extras.
This is definitely a recommended episode of MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000.  In fact, this DVD would be worth the price even if the posture short were the only thing on it.  Unfortunately, the MST3k DVD releases are becoming less and less special as time goes on.  The first batch had loads of features, including the option to jump back and forth between the regular version and the MST3k version of the film.  Sadly, this release lacks that option, as well as the very animated menus of those first discs.",1020124800,,2047,4.652777777777778

Do not use sharp implements after viewing.
Interestingly enough, I recently had the opportunity to speak to Mike Nelson. I asked him which were his most and least favorite episodes were.

For some reason, he gets involved in a seven man invasion of Cuba in the middle of the movie (why? who knows?) but that plot thread peeters out soon enough, like many of the ""action"" sequences.  There is nothing resembling acting throughout most of this movie, and the dialog is monotonous in tone (nevermind content) and indistinct.  Like some of the funnier MST3K episodes, there isn't a lot of inherently funny stuff going on here like bad special effects, ridiculous costumes and dialog, so Mike and the Bots have to struggle to find the humor.

The bonus is we all get a very funny movie watching experience.  Rhino DVD has been pretty slow in releasing MST3K titles to market, however when they do get released, I will say the transfers to this digital medium are fantastic!  Very crisp clean video, excellent audio and not a lot of DVD nonsense(elaborate menus and silly actions when the icons are pushed).  Keeping in mind that the movies that are featured are old and scratchy and DVD can't do much about that regardless.

The hilarious training camp sequence (climb a rope, jump off a small sand dune, climb back up on the rope) and the tragic Bay Of Pigs invasion force, consisting of 7 guys.
A guy in a big fake beard playing Castro...the weird interlude where the blind woman plays the piano as they drop her daddy down a well(for what reason I never could figure out).

Like 'Skydivers' and other Francis films MST3K has featured, 'Red Zone Cuba' is an exercise in confusion and despair. The 'acting' (really, standing around and mumbling lines) is bad, the editing worse, and the plot seems never to have made it onto the set. Fortunately, the bleakness is leavened somewhat by a great little short, 'Platform Posture and Appearance,' which highlights two favorite topics of MSTed shorts, posture and public speaking, and the classic 'Happy Upbeat Song' the Bots perform at the end.

Did they even need to go to Cuba?
Worst of all, the editing is terrible.  Certain shots happen twice in a row, many crucial scenes are skipped over, and the films so riddled with jump-cuts you'll break your neck just watching it.

Folks will remember Petey in such films as The SkyDivers and Time Chasers. Once again, Petey takes to the sky and flies three unknown guys to someplace where they climb cliffs, run like the Monkees across a beach and other ... stuff.

Little is known about Petey the Plane except that in 1967, Petey was up for an Oscar in his timely role in Red Zone. Unfortunately, Petey lost to Wings the Plane who stole the scenes in the movie The Skydivers. Petey, heartbroken and bitter over Hollywood's betrayal, turned to a life of crime. Petey ran drugs across the Mexican border for five years and was finally caught after he tried to kill a rival plane.

Petey spent a year in prison and 'found the light' in that he realized his blunders and became the 'model plane'. He was finally released for good behavior and began flying sick children to hospitals around the country. Of course, the doctors weren't really too happy with Petey in that the no one schedule the flights, but all agreed, Petey was finally reformed.

Today, Petey leads a happy life in Los Angels CA as he tours the country warning other small planes of the hazards of running drugs across the borders. Petey has also returned to filming such films as Jet Crash 2011 and was also on an episode of The Office, in which he flies the Office team to a destination. Petey is also planning to work on a remake of Red Zone Cuba 2016 to be released in the fall of 2017. Don't miss out!!

The ideas is this, Griffin escapes from jail, joins up with two traveling tramps, goes to invade Cuba for the money, fails, escapes, decides to go straight and live happily ever after.  Sadly, to get the money to go straight they toss a guy down a frog mine, steal his car and end up being killed.  And if you think that is bad remember a LOT of the movie was cut out by MST3K.  Like the rape scene!  That's right, Griffin rapes a blind woman, but from what I understand it looks like a fake wrestling match.
Bad editing, bad writing, and just bad everything.  I even heard a rumor that some of the audio track went missing and they had to do certain parts over again.  Did they do anything right?  Well, I think they did.
The encounters with the police at the start felt real, as if the actors have had dealings with the cops before.  So did the meal of beans and coffee around the fire, the sense of wandering without a goal or a place to call home.  Lets face it, most of the actors in this flick had lived on the street at least once in their lives, and were able to bring that to the big screen.  These folks were homeless people given money to make a movie.  And they failed.
I doubt they ever invaded a small island nation or searched for wealth in the mountains or flown a plane.  Still, they tried.
This movie makes you ask - why did they make it?  Who put up the money to make it?  Why did John Carradine act in it?  And why do people think the song was sung by him?
