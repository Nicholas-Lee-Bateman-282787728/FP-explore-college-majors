3126623,1,B00149JKDE,"I started watching this moving a total of 3 times and NEVER finished it, each time.  To say this is low-budget is being kind and unfortunately, the low-budgetness (is that a word) keeps this moving from being enjoyable and the wonderful message that I'm sure it meant to deliver, gets lost.  The acting was simply horrible and unsettling to watch.  Each time I watched the movie, I was determined to get through it and although each time brought me further into the movie, there was always a point where I decided, enough is enough, I just can't do this.  The script was awful and I'm glad I was able to support a Christian film monetarily, but unfortunately, the film is now in DVD Hades along with such titles as Forbidden Kingdom, Dragonball Evolution and Ladies Man' (Forget about my money, I want my brain cells and those tortuous hours of my life back).",1266019200,3,859,4.594771241830065

I think the overriding theme is acceptance and not being put into a box based on others expectations of you.  And trutfully the attitude of what a ""christian"" woman should be held by the brother in the film is all to often reality.

8254709,4,B00149JKDE,I really enjoyed the movie it was so sweet..,1514073600,,44,4.0
8254710,2,B00149JKDE,"Ok, I did not watch all of this and it has nothing to do with acting or plot or storyline... I do not find it entertaining to overtly shine a light on things that actually do happen in the 'Black"" church... I mean are there movies about caucasians and buffoonery in their churches.... not trying to be a debbie downer on comedy or entertainment, I feel as a community we can find more to be funny or more to be entertaining.",1505347200,2,424,4.246913580246914

8254712,5,B00149JKDE,"I love this movie!  It has a mixture of drama and comedy, which makes it a great choice for movie night.  When my daughter-in-law comes to visit, she always puts on this movie.  This move is well acted, very entertaining and a great movie to add to your dvds collection.",1480291200,,270,4.36
8254713,5,B00149JKDE,Like this movie just the storyline could have been better alot of inconsistencies also seemed like Rachel and David quickly jumped in a relationship and got engaged shortly after the movie leaves you with alot of unanswered questions like what happened with David and Simone,1475366400,,274,5.111111111111111
8254714,3,B00149JKDE,I enjoyed this film and the ideas surrounding the film. There a lot of stereotypes related to who is and who can be a Christian. This movie helped examine those stereotypes.,1414886400,,173,4.612903225806452
8254715,1,B00149JKDE,I was very disappointed in this film.  The quality was very poor.  The sound on some of the characters was difficult to hear and understand.  Last but not least the the storyline was inconsistent.  It was definitely a waste of money.  A poorly executed project.,1412812800,,261,4.711111111111111
