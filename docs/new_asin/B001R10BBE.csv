In late 2008 word was released that Project Blue Earth would be one of over 30 ADV Films' titles transferred to Funimation Entertainment.  The announcement not only proved Funimation's dedication to becoming a powerhouse player in the domestic anime DVD industry, it also hinted of the potential within titles that may have otherwise been overlooked.

Packaged in a single standard DVD case, Project Blue Earth SOS contains the complete animated series across two discs.  Each disc contains three 45-minute episodes (which originally filled an hour slot in Japanese broadcast television with commercials).  The total runtime comes in at 288 minutes.

The cover art of the set, the interior drawings, disc art and even the advertising campaign all hint heavily toward the 1950s era science fiction theme that the show very successfully emulates.  I'll be honest, I went in to the series a bit skeptical not only because I'm fearful of such gimmicks in anime but also because 50's cinema has never been the epitome of realistic science fiction in my opinion.

The story is fairly straightforward; anyone who has enjoyed tales like War of the Worlds, The Day the Earth Stood Still, or Independence Day will delight.  The earth is invaded by a malevolent and relentless race of alien intruders possessing technology far superior to our own.  Earth has the foresight to create a top-secret organization with the purpose of intercepting any such potential threat.

The struggle presented is epic on a global scale and for the most part, it works surprisingly well.  The aliens themselves are well crafted with just enough depth to back up the idea that they are technologically advanced when compared to us (I mean so often in sci-fi we find beings of superior intelligence that act like nothing more than animals).  Additionally (and I won't ruin the surprise for you) these creatures turn out to be far more than they initially appear.  Solving this story arc's mystery turns out to be great fun during the later portion of the show.

Pacing is simply spectacular as there are literally no dragging plot-moments throughout the entire show's run.  Each episode is an exercise in plot advancement, action, and just plain alien-bashing fun even if the humans often end up getting the short end of the stick.  Because of a relatively high budget, the show's creative staff was able to choreograph the action sequences with the type of attention usually reserved in the United States for feature films.  Artwork is clean and sharp and observant viewers may note use of an abundance of green in color palette (skies, water, even the earth from afar) to dictate the show's vintage mood.

Also taking from the 1950s feel is a jazzy big-band sound score that fits subtly into the grander motif.  The English dub is very appropriate with slightly over the top acting that wouldn't be out of place in a vintage cereal commercial.

I said above that the whole 50s theme initially gave me doubts about the show's legitimacy.  Fortunately those concerns proved nullified shortly into the first few episodes.  Yes the theme and mood captures those days really well (reel-to-reel tape recorders, big finned Cadillacs, radio dramas), the story development and science are certainly on par with science fiction films of today's ultra high standards.

The beauty of shows like Project Blue Earth SOS is that they come on strong from the opening sequence and don't quit until the final episode concludes.  There isn't much in the way of layered plot depth, goofy editing to overcomplicate things, or mind-boggling theories (what if life was all a dream?) to screw things up.  Instead it's the type of action-driven fun that simply begs for a big bowl of popcorn and a cold bottle of root beer.

The 1950's gimmick seems to come on strong through the first few episodes then fades to the background as the story begins to stand on its own.  By the time you're knee-deep in the second (and final) disc, I noticed that it became much more difficult to categorize the show by a decade alone.  As a final bonus, the color pallet increases by the concluding scenes, which does away with the earlier vintage feel altogether.

Funimation has a definite gem in their ever-increasing catalog with Project Blue Earth SOS.  I recommend this to anyone looking to relax with a few solid hours of interstellar mayhem.  Just don't forget to pick up the microwave popcorn.",1241136000,6,4609,4.922380336351876
8337132,5,B001R10BBE,Great anime! Proof that you don't have to have a long extended-out series in order to have a great story! Get it! One of the better animes out there!,1486339200,,149,4.172413793103448
8337133,3,B001R10BBE,"Honestly i would give it a 3.5 if i could cause i rather like it despite the fact that i don't care much for alien themed ...anything really. This show made me nostalgic about the alien movies i watched as a kid like mars attacks and independents day and war of the worlds (the old one from 1953). It has every alien invasion movie cliche in the book (though i don't think it's a bad thing in this anime), but stills has a rather different ending then any of the movies i mentioned. There is one things that annoyed me. One of the main characters called billy he in the beginning kinda irritated me cause he seemed to yell or speak in a loud voice when it wasn't necessary.",1457049600,,673,4.224806201550388
8337134,5,B001R10BBE,This was a great short series.  I wish there was more,1427155200,,53,3.8181818181818183
8337135,1,B001R10BBE,The production quality of the movie was great. The story was too simple to the point of stupid. Maybe they were targeting a specific audience. If I had to purchase this again I would not.,1384819200,,187,4.371428571428571
8337136,5,B001R10BBE,"Best show on what could happen during an alien invasion of Earth that I am aware of. The theme is a stockstandard one of the aliens have arrived to conquer the citizens of Earth and take over, and will do anything they can to achieve control of the world. The
story is well paced and absolutely laden with suspense and the seriousness of the dire situation the main characters face, as they try everything they can think of, to stop the invasion/takeover in time. There is a fair bit of bickering and arguing between them which was a bit much at times, but does convey well the tension of the events unfolding. Plenty of interesting ways are tried to save the day, won't plot spoil, see for yourself..Stellar animation quality and production values and thought provoking and gripping viewing that will have you watching the whole lot in one sitting! One I will see again, worth it.",1379203200,,881,4.617834394904459
8337137,5,B001R10BBE,"Loved it! Quick little series with very little fluff. I usually watch things in their original language, but the dubbing in this one had more oomf and made more sense in english because of the homage to 50's b-movies. I thought all the characters were very lovable. Would recommend this to non anime lovers as well.",1367798400,,315,4.642857142857143
8337138,5,B001R10BBE,"Done in homage to B movie science fiction invasion films of the 50s and 60s, Project Blue Earth SOS has a style
all it's own, Alien invaders, 2 boy geniuses, a military hero, secret agents, a fighter ace and more combine to make this alternate
universe shine..

So strap on your jet pack,or hop in your hover-car and get taken for a fun fast paced ride through the universe of ""Popular Mechanics""",1363910400,2,396,4.5
8337139,4,B001R10BBE,Nice DVD movie. Just that it took so long to get. Other than that the movie was good. I really think its good that some people think that some kids can make decision as hard as in the movie.,1350604800,,190,3.8974358974358974
8337140,5,B001R10BBE,"I purchased several anime DVDs on a whim.... Project Blue Earth SOS is no exception.  The classic `aliens attacking Earth' premise presented in a `modern retro' setting... with 2 youths rivaling
each other in science and theories (the rest withheld to avoid spoilers).  Very entertaining.  It took me back to the first `Astro Boy' series and Speed Racer.",1280102400,,354,5.068965517241379
8337141,5,B001R10BBE,"I really enjoyed this 1950s/60s sci-fi -style anime.  In many ways it is the anime version of the old TOM SWIFT series of kid's books complete with boy lead characters.  The retrofuture artwork and music is very good in the SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF THE FUTURE/ LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN vein.  The plot starts off strong but then wanders around a bit eventually coasting over the finish line, also like tthe two films just mentioned.  To paraphrase a previous reviewer, while this is not quite THE INCREDIBLES, it might just be MONSTERS VS. ALIENS.  Despite this, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone.  Now if they would just make another LAST EXILE, FULL METAL ALCHEMIST, or CODE GEASS, I would be happy.",1273622400,,744,4.7734375
