8361612,3,B002BLNGU2,"This compilation of shows from MonsterQuest series. The MonsterQuest crew examine the evidence supporting the existence of four ""monsters"" featured in movies and literature. The segments are amusing, somewhat informative, and disturbing at times, but ultimately the evidence for the existence of the monsters examined is inconclusive. If you already own a library MonsterQuest DVDs you probably have these segments.",1277510400,7,415,5.933333333333334
