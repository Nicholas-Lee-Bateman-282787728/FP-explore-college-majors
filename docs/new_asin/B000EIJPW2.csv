2521624,2,B000EIJPW2,"I am abig fan of the LS tapes and do from 2-5 miles everyday. This tape is a true BEGINNERS TAPE so if you have walked with Leslie at all this isn't for you. The tape is in 3 sections 10 minutes each and the only one that is up to speed is the 3rd brisk walk with weights. There is too much repition of side steps and very little variation BORING!!!!
Skip this one. It was made for th JEnny Craig progrma and was to introduce people to fitness. So all I can say is if you haven't gotten off the couch in a while or ever and want to start. This is a good beginning.",1334966400,2,564,3.8290598290598292
2521625,5,B000EIJPW2,"This DVD includes a 20 minute walk using 1.5 weights ( Leslie's walk-away-weights) followed by a 20 minute light strength training segment. You can choose not to use the weights if you wish.  The walk does get fairly brisk but it is short, so it is doable for a beginner.  I choose this one when I want to walk and do a little strength work but I'm short on time, or lacking alot of energy. You could boost the intensity by upping the weights to a maximum of 3 lbs during the walking. During the toning segment, use whatever weights you're comfortable with.  It's your choice.
The walk or toning might be a good warm up for someone who is going on to a more strenuous workout.  It's quite versatile.  I would recommend this one to beginners just starting a fitness program.",1303257600,16,773,4.415492957746479
2521626,5,B000EIJPW2,"Great workout by Leslie Sansone. This is another video I have  tried. There are three ten minute segments to customize your workout. The first ten minutes is lighter than the rest and gets you going. The nest ten minutes is more brisk,it takes you through more of a brisk walk. The last segment is where they add hand weights to the walk to build muscle and burn more calories. The whole workout sums up about 30 minutes but you can walk your way. You can do the whole workout in order for 30 minutes,or mix and match each segment. Or just do two or even one of the segments if you are pressed for time. There is no exscuses for exercise now. You can walk you way.",1170806400,11,664,4.228346456692913

8110515,5,B000EIJPW2,"I have a library of Leslie's DVDs, and this is one the very best focusing on cross-training. Full body cardio and strength in 40 minutes. I love Leslie's workouts because she walks you through the moves safely and effectively - unlike other DVDs out there with crazy moves that may cause injuries.",1424995200,6,297,4.730769230769231

8110518,4,B000EIJPW2,"I bought this to complete the Jenny Craig tapes I found and I'm glad I got it. It is a little simple for a more advanced owrkout but I did this one followed by a 2 mile 30 minute workout and it was great for that type of workout.
The Jenny Craig videos LS did are so well produced and the music is unsual so if you are a fan theya re worth getting hold of",1335916800,8,355,3.6842105263157894
