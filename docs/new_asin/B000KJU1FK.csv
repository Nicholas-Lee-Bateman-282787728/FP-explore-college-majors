2692335,4,B000KJU1FK,"It's slow the first few episodes but it really begins to pick up when I see my favorite ""whose liner"" Tony Slattery. Just when the show is really getting good...the episodes are over. The really good and memorable episodes are down the line. I really hope they put out the other seasons because I'm really lookin forward to seeing the episodes I saw on Comedy Central but was too busy laughing to record. While the American Whose line is good..the British Whose line is better. The disc is the begining of this awesome show and worth watching and buying.",1181692800,6,554,4.606060606060606
2692336,4,B000KJU1FK,This British improv show is so funny.  I admire the participants' ability to think so quickly and still find the humor.  I have watched the American version but I much prefer Clive Anderson as host.,1181260800,4,198,4.628571428571429
2692337,5,B000KJU1FK,"As others have said, I didn't mind the American version but I was let down that it wasn't as funny as the British version that had shown on Comedy Central here in the U.S. The British version is much edgier and more cerebral...while being funnier. I lamented that I wasn't able to get this on DVD until now. While Drew Carey is funny on his show, he wasn't quite the host that Clive Anderson was. Clive Anderson's strength is that he did NOT get involved with the players other than to move the show along. And he certainly did not try to be funnier than his comedic guests.

This is the set to get!!",1176508800,25,600,4.2631578947368425
2692338,5,B000KJU1FK,"Some things you should know about the British (and original) version of this amazing show that brought improv into the mainstream: it is slower, takes more risks with the themes that are often engaging for their sheer impromptu acting talent than out-and-out humor, and is generally a bit more of a British style humor (witty, rather than ha-ha) with liberal references to tidbits from the esoteric fields such as historical writers and such.

The first DVD starts somewhat slow and sweaty; you can actually see the beads in the first pilot. My advice: flounder through these first 2-3 episodes. There are gems of genius strewn even in those episodes, especially with Jacie and Tony Slattery. Very soon it becomes evident that the actors are warming up to the innovative format. Season 2 is fabulous and you can see that unlike Drew Carry, Clive Anderson does not get involved with his participants, which actually lends more credibility to the whole affair.

Oh, and the starting credits for each episode are fun, a caper that was dropped in the US version. This is a prized possession. Stop ruminating and get it; you know you'll be watching it more than once.",1176076800,12,1162,4.863636363636363
2692339,5,B000KJU1FK,"My DVDs arrived today and I am almost through the first of the set. It wouldn't mean much for me to say this is my favorite television show, the best I have ever seen - I am not much of a television show person. What I can say is that this show is one of the best things in my entire life. I had not seen it for perhaps 14 years or longer, and it is such a joy. Nothing makes me laugh this much constantly, though kittens playing has the same wonderful exuberance and sort of ""blessedness"" as this. I have tears in my eyes constantly from laughing so much, and I missed laughing and smiling like this for 14 years. I do believe you will enjoy it, too. I would give it infinite stars if I could; I believe it is flawless. Of course there are contestants one likes less than others - one has one's favorites and some of them one doesn't like at all. But those one likes are truly, as someone here said, best friends. If you are sad, depressed, fighting colossal, seemingly insuperable chronic problems in your life, I encourage you to get this. If anyone involved with the show or the release of it onto DVD should ever read this, I should like to thank everyone for both the show and its release, and to clamor for speediest release of the rest. Thank you.",1174953600,10,1255,4.211618257261411
2692340,5,B000KJU1FK,"I am so glad to see these gems released, and on NTSC as well! So many people have never seen the British version which is far funnier IMO. The skits and such varied, I don't think Film and Theater Styles was on the US version. We see some very talented people on the Brit show, Josie Lawrence is funnier than any women on the US version, as is Sandy Toksvig. All the Brits are quick witted with songs and skits. Ryan and Colin are always funny, but I prefer the Brits' humor. Tony Slattery is my personal fave, and I am so glad more Americans like me will see him, and note how cheekily clever he is as well as being a good singer. The overly hammy John Sessions is here in all his in-your-face glory. How I missed Paul's 'What's going on?"" looks, and they are here! ( I still like him teamed up with a Tub of Lard, but that's a different show, which hopefully will be released someday). Watch him sweat trying to make up a song. Clive as the host is good, with the constant bald, no-neck jokes the guys throw at him. Sometimes Clive has to cover his face when he's about to lose it when things get out of control. Clive, Sandy, Tony, Josie, Paul, Steven, etc, all about to be rediscovered by a new continent! If you have only seen the US version, please buy this! The humor can be more cerebral (and at times much more naughty) than the US shows, but it's funnier that way. You'll discover a bunch of new friends on this show.
Buy this if you have not seen the British version, you'll probably be join the majority who like it better. And I'm a Yank!",1174867200,12,1551,4.208053691275167
2692341,5,B000KJU1FK,"Ever since the American version was released on DVD I've been hoping the release of the British version would not be far behind.  I became a fan of the British version when it was first aired on Comedy Central.  I'm looking forward to being able to replace the episodes I taped off of those airings with this and succeeding DVD releases.  I so prefer Clive Anderson as a host!  As someone else mentioned in a previous review, I don't think John Session's had the best skills for this show.  However, I'm looking forward to seeing many of my favorite guests in these episodes.  I can't wait to see Paul Merton struggle during a singing improv again.",1167609600,5,648,4.543103448275862
2692342,5,B000KJU1FK,"You wouldn't believe the vast hordes of people out there who have scurried away old off-air recordings of these first two seasons.  They are impossible to see on Comedy Central or BBC America, and even then probably have significant cuts.

There are very dry patches in these first episodes.  John Sessions isn't so much ""funny ha ha"" as he is ""WTF!?  Who let this guy in?""  There are long passages of games that never quite get to the point, and celebrity guests that aren't really cut out for improv (but it's sometimes funny to watch the others mock them as they fail.)  These may sound like bad things, but in my opinion it is essential to have a ""warts and all"" first season to let the show grow and improve.

Once it does find its footing, however, you will again be dazzled by the wit and talent of the guests, mostly taken from the ""Comedy Store Players"" -- a very diverse group of bizarrely gifted people.

Enjoy!",1164585600,16,922,4.479041916167665
2692343,5,B000KJU1FK,"This is the one I've been waiting for.  The REAL, British, version of Whose Line is it Anyway?  While the American version is OK, it's just not quite as good as the real thing.  This set should include all 30 episodes from the first 2 seasons which includes 4 compilation episodes and the original Pilot.

The first season introduces regular host Clive Anderson with early regular Whose Liners' Josie Lawrence, Michael McShane, John Sessions, and Tony Slattery with Richard Vranch on music support.  You'll also find 4 2nd season episodes with Greg Proops, who appeared in 50 episodes in total, and one with Ryan Stiles who began with this season and went on to be in 75 others across the series 136 total episodes.  Colin Mochrie would not appear until season 3.  And, thankfully, there is NO Hoedown with Drew Carey to be found in any of the British episodes!

A real treat for fans of British humor and off-the-wall improv type comedy.",1164499200,33,938,4.711656441717792

Getting to watch the jokes that were just too crude to be shown on public television is great, although before this DVD, I honestly believed that they did true improv on the show, and now that belief is in the garbage.

I personally found it a little disappointing because it's really nothing like American Who's Line. The games they play are more intellectual and contain far less juvenile humor than American Who's Line games. While I still enjoyed it, I much prefer the American version of the show.

Only the special features are really uncensored, and even with those, about 25% are things the censors were just being overly politically correct with. You could tell the talent wasn't very happy with the censors at times and I don't blame them. I think most of the ""uncensored"" stuff are things that would be aired normally on a channel like Comedy Central, but since the show was basically owned by Disney at the time, they considered very mild things as controversial.

I can't say whether it was better than the American version or not; I didn't see more than an episode or two of the US version, and I am heavily influenced by the fact that I saw the UK version (on Comedy Central) first. Plus I was raised by an anglophile, so that probably doesn't help either.

The point is that it's improv comedy done by truly fabulous people. It probably helps to either be British or be really into British humor, but for my husband and me it's hilarious.

Whether or not your skeptical about the reality of this show, it still remains that it is hilarious to watch and the truth of the matter is that everyone on this show is well-versed in improv. I've never cared for Drew Carey on the show, but everyone else really shines (even a young Stephen Colbert!)

The DVD bonus features are limited to outtakes but watching some of those are even funnier that the show itself! (Ryan Stiles making fun of the producer behind his back is absolutely hysterical!) If you even remotely liked the show this collection is well-worth a look. I do a lot of acting and have taken improv classes and will sometimes watch a few episodes to help reinforce my basic improv fundamentals because they are all there!

2692500,5,B000KJU1FK,"High quality sketch comedy was dormant for about 15 years after the last episodes of ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" aired before another rivaled it. By the 1990's, the UK improv television show, ""Whose Line Is It Anyway?"", was the first sketch comedy show to equal the originality of Monty Python, even when you take into consideration Saturday Night Live which has always been rather mixed in the effectiveness and funny department. The later US version of ""Whose Line"" was decent but was never quite as entertaining as the original British offering which had a subtle spontaneity lacking from most other comedy shows on both sides of the pond.

Unlike ""Flying Circus"" and ""Saturday Night Live"" which were scripted, ""Whose Line Is It Anyway"" was entirely improvised. The host, Clive Anderson, would moderate four comedian/contestants and contrive interesting and often wacky scenarios upon which the contestants would then improvise. These could be scenes, songs, or just dialog. Aside from Anderson's often quirky settings, inspiration could come from the audience members whom Anderson would ask to come up with characters and/or places which the contestants would then act on. At the end of each show, Anderson would decide the winner who would read the credits in a style of Anderson's choosing.

One of the reasons the show worked so well was the endless plethora of material since the performers could act out any situation, which could be a bank, a prison, a hardware store, or any number of settings, either mundane or sophisticated. They enacted scenes in the style of genre movies, like westerns and horror movies, film noir and romance. They could act out historical figures, movie/television actors, or characters completely made up. One favorite was having three of the performers each play a character with some strange quirk (like one person believing he's Superman) and arrive at a party in which the host has to figure out who they are. Another was a scene in which two performers have a dialog in which they can only ask questions. They even improvised the lyrics of songs which always stunned me.

Many great stand-up and comedic talent were put through Anderson's ringers, and I don't believe there was ever a weak link. However, two talents stood out beyond most of the rest (in more ways than one), which were the American Ryan Stiles and the Scotsman Colin Mochrie. Whenever either of them were among the performers, and particularly if both were at Anderson's disposal, you were guaranteed an half hour of incredible comedic entertainment. I honestly don't know how these guys did what they did. Their improvised lines were as good and often better than scripted TV shows being shown on other stations. In one scene, Mochire and Stiles are at a bank vault. Whiles Stiles is pretending to be sealing the vault, Mochrie says ""Why are you putting my wife in there?"" Without a moment's hesitation, Stiles replies, ""Collateral.""

Despite much of the mediocre shows offered by the networks in the 1990's, particularly in the United States (barring Seinfeld) ""Whose Line Is It Anyway?"" demonstrated how much mileage could be gotten without a huge budget or elaborate productions. There were no sets, no costumes, no writers, and no scripts. Only four performers, a stage, an occasional chair or two, and a moderator. And ten years of some of the funniest television I have ever seen. Saturday Night Live, eat your heart out.",1309910400,,3442,5.02276707530648

2692510,2,B000KJU1FK,"Perhaps this first season was a new step into audience-interactive comedy...
Perhaps the first 20-30 episodes were the necessary step to get the Brits to loosen up...
Whatever the cause, this video collection is tough to get through without utilizing the >>] button on your remote. The jokes seem forced, like squeezing cement out of a garden hose. The host is more like a golf-analyst quoting the rules and regulations than an MC who keeps things moving. For the most part, the actors are loose and light enough to provide some humor, but there's often 1 or 2 who simply cannot stop taking themselves or their craft so seriously. The games given to the actors are written creatively but give little leniency for the actors themselves to be creative. And it doesn't get any easier once they move on to Season Two. Sure, the games are more familiar, the host relaxes a tiny bit, and transitions become more fluid, but overall it's just as staid and strictly censored as Season One. Unlike the English language, this is an example of something created by the British that was vastly improved by their American counterparts!
And, on a purely professional note, the lighting & set-up are atrocious! Compared to the American version, it's like watching the movie Avatar in black & white. The stage is so ..blah.., the lighting makes the actors look pasty and ill, and the overall pastel nature of British fashion at that time makes the audience blend into each other when the cameras pan the crowd.

To be quite honest, I bought this season as well as the 2-volume set of the first American season, and Brad & Colin's Two Man Group...and I couldn't put this down fast enough to get to the others! Maybe someday when I'm sick, stuck at home, and there's *absolutely nothing else* on TV worth watching...and I can't find a book...and the house is already spotless...maybe then I'll force myself to pick it back up and watch the rest of it...",1302912000,,1934,4.72189349112426

2692518,5,B000KJU1FK,"So, I am an unashamed fan of this epic TV show - so this review may be a little giddy with happiness that the seasons are starting to roll out on DVD.

But I will endeavour to stick to form and evaluate the DVD being presented.

This DVD presents season 1 of the american version of ""Whose Line is It Anyway"", I don't fully agree with other reviews there that say this season is weaker than later seasons. This is from the same producing team that created the British version that ran for many years. Although Drew Carey does improve as a presenter in later seasons!

The DVD has a few extra bits on it that show outtakes and stuff that never made it to air. My favourite is when we get to see the between the takes footage. The performers making fun of the producing team etc.

This is one of the only DVD series I would buy without even seeing the quality of them. But it really is a great start to hopefully a full collection of this epic TV show.",1276128000,,950,4.174863387978142

2692527,3,B000KJU1FK,"I started watching Whose Line years ago when the British version was rerunned on Comedy Central, little did I know that the majority of those hilarious episodes were not pulled from the first 2 seasons. Ryan Stiles is little to be seen and the first season heavily features a guy named John Sessions who is an arrogant prat - he thinks he's great and almost never follows the storyline and watching him do Party Quirks is just painful. With the exception of the ghastly 80's attire, I have always preferred the British version until I saw John Sessions.

I have to admit I didn't really enjoy it at the least until Greg and Ryan had their bits. Some of the other comedians were funny from time to time but I really enjoyed the American version a lot more. A lot of people reviewing claimed the British Version is way better which is why I bought it but...ehh I'll have to strongly disagree.,1248825600,2,551,4.3076923076923075

2692556,4,B000KJU1FK,"If you've only seen and enjoyed the American version of this show hosted by Drew Carey, you're in for a treat.  This is the original, which debuted on Britain's Channel Four in 1988 and ran for ten seasons, later becoming a staple here in the States on Comedy Central. It started off with an all-British cast and weekly regular John Sessions, as well as occasional guests you might recognize like Stephen Fry, Peter Cook and Jonathan Pryce. Soon regulars like Tony Slattery, Paul Merton, Sandy Toksvig, and the wonderful Josie Lawrence joined the cast, and occasionally a North American might be thrown into the mix - Mike McShane was probably the most frequently-appearing and funniest of the Americans in the first two seasons, but other future U.S.-version regulars like Ryan Stiles and Greg Proops appeared as well. The show started off rather dry and cerebral but often quite funny, and as some of the more animated cast members joined, it got more raucous and even a bit bawdy. U.S. viewers may not get some of the distinctly British references, but they'll recognize some of the ""games"" adopted for the U.S. version, like ""Party Quirks"", ""Props"", and ""Song Stylings"", the last of which really gave Lawrence and McShane a chance to shine. And though host Clive Anderson might seem like a ""stiff"" compared to Drew Carey, he has his own distinct brand of dry wit.  This set is ""uncensored"" so it contains some lines and scenes that have never appeared on American TV.  There aren't many ""extras"", but the interview with producers Dan Patterson and Mark Leveson is interesting. (Did you know that they turned down Mike Myers and Steve Carell in American auditions for the show?)  The price is right, too, for a couple dozen episodes of one of the funniest shows on TV.

2692565,5,B000KJU1FK,"Thank you so much to the powers that be for finally releasing my favorite TV show ever on DVD in the US. Ever since I purchased this set a month ago it has been playing pretty much non-stop in my apartment.

If all you've ever seen is the American version, you don't know what you're missing. Believe me when I say you don't have to be British to appreciate the British Whose Line series - I was born and bred in New York City (although admittedly I am an Anglophile, so I may be a bit biased in my opinion.)

Overall though, the British series of WLiiA was just *better* than the US version. It was quirkier, rowdier, more risque. The cast was well-rounded, not the same people every week like the American version. And the castmembers habitually picking on each other and on Clive (the host) is always the funniest part of the show.

Great chemistry between the contestants in this series - it's not just Ryan & Colin anymore! - I especially love the banter between Josie & Paul, Josie & Tony, Josie & anyone, really - the #1 thing wrong with the US version is that it doesn't have nearly enough Josie Lawrence in it!

I can see how the earlier seasons of this show might put off some American viewers - it's positively bursting with obscure British actors no one on this side of the pond has ever heard of, couple that with about a million references to short-lived British '80s TV shows and it could potentially be a recipe for disaster to any hardcore US WLiiA fan - but trust me this DVD set is not lacking any talent, and it definitely brings the funny. Plus it's amusing to see some of the more prominent American contestants like Ryan Stiles & Greg Proops looking so young and spunky!

And yes, this set does come packed to the brim with John Sessions - he was a regular contestant then, appearing in all of the 1st and most of the 2nd season episodes - but don't let the ""boring"" stigma associated with his name put you off. The guy is actually witty as hell [once you get past his incessantly pretentious picks for ""Authors"", that is]. His chemistry with Gryff Rhys Jones is especially awesome, and the man really knows how to play a good round of ""Opera"".

Overall, this is just a great buy. Buy it if you were a fan of the US series, buy it if you like British comedy, I would even recommend it to fans of Frasier or Seinfeld or any of the wittier American sitcoms that have been floating around these past 15 years or so.

In closing, Paul Merton rules! :)",1205971200,7,2470,4.344902386117137
2692566,5,B000KJU1FK,"The American version of ""Whose Line Is It Anyway?"" is fine, but it just doesn't compare with the original British version. I used to watch this show religiously on Comedy Central, and there were times when I'd laugh so hard I'd cry. That's how funny the British version of ""Whose Line"" can be when all four players are operating on the same comic wavelength, with the marvelous ringmaster Clive Anderson overlooking the proceedings. Sure, there are gags that misfire, but so what? That's the risk of improv comedy! I have the deepest respect & admiration for the regulars on the UK ""Whose Line,"" such as John Sessions, Josie Lawrence, Tony Slattery, Paul Merton, Sandi Toksvig, and regular American performers like Michael McShane, Greg Proops, Archie Hahn, and Ryan Stiles (though he's Canadian), to name a few. There are other performers who appeared less often (or only once!), like Peter Cook, Jonathan Pryce, Griff Rhys-Jones, Arthur Smith & Jimmy Mulville, but they all still left their mark on this hilarious show, too. I don't know how they manage to come up with this stuff right on the spot, but it really is amazing to watch. For me, watching the British ""Whose Line Is It Anyway?"" is like spending time with very good, very funny & talented friends who just want to entertain you and who don't mind looking the fool if it makes you laugh. While there's no question that some episodes are funnier than others, the genuinely funny episodes are glorious comic gems that you can enjoy again and again. You'll know which episodes they are when you see them (I'll give you a hint, though: the early episodes are funny enough, but things *really* kick into high gear when Michael McShane joins the contestants in episode 10). I'm thrilled that seasons 1 & 2 of the original ""Whose Line Is It Anyway?"" are now on DVD in this excellent, affordable box set package. However, keep in mind that these are only the first two seasons! There are many more improv comedy treats to enjoy in the seasons to come (there are ten in all), so don't let us down, A&E.

These skits are hilarious!  My wife and I will sometimes be in tears laughing at these incredibly skilled actors who can do amazing improvisational comedy.  They also have a great rapport with each other, which is probably the key to the show.

That being said, the first season doesn't quite live up to the later seasons.  Some of the skits (""games"") were a bit lame and not that funny - it's as if the writers were still searching for the best ideas for the show.  And don't get excited about the ""Uncensored"" label, because little if anything in this season was actually censored, so you won't see anything that you haven't already seen.

2692574,5,B000KJU1FK,"I'd like to ask A&E Home Video to release the rest of the UK seasons! this DVD was great - we want the whole series please =)

thank you",1196121600,3,136,3.689655172413793
2692575,5,B000KJU1FK,"This show is great ! The only downfall is they don't release the dvd's fast enough ! I loved this show on ABC and ABC Family reruns. Drew and ""his buds"" hit every comedic note and then some ! Great viewing for anyone who loves improv and on the spot laughs !",1195603200,,258,3.980769230769231
2692576,5,B000KJU1FK,If you are looking for a good laugh and a big smile; this is the DVD to buy. The gag-reel really is worth the purcase alone! Hope they will make more of these DVDs.,1194739200,,164,3.8529411764705883
2692577,5,B000KJU1FK,"Funny, Funny, Funny! Whose Line Is It Anyway? is a hilarious show full of sketches, music and unscripted moments. Buy it for a good time!",1194739200,,137,4.52
2692578,5,B000KJU1FK,very good show. could not stop laughing even after the show. Excellent stand up comedy.,1194048000,,87,4.866666666666666
2692579,5,B000KJU1FK,"One of the best series, in one of the best times.

At the beginning, especially in the Pilot, it is a bit shakey, but even then the comedy is still there.

John Sessions, Jose Lawrence, Paul Merton and Tony Slattery are the core of these series, and they are there at their best.

Clive Anderson, after a shakey start, moves the show along slickly but not without humour himself.",1193788800,2,379,4.463768115942029
2692580,5,B000KJU1FK,Another great British show brought to the States.  I love this show.  Even after it went off the air I watch it faithfully in syndication on the family channel.  My three year old daughter is also now a fan.  It is great to have these on DVD.  The freedom to watch them when I want just makes it more enjoyable.  Having a rough day?  Throw on Whose Line.  Having friends over and not sure what to do?  Throw on Whose Line.  Whose Line may just be the answer to many tough questions in life.  Great comedy from some of the most talented Improvers of the day.  It is a crime to see it canceled.,1193616000,,592,4.0964912280701755
2692581,4,B000KJU1FK,"If you liked this show on TV, you must buy the DVD collection. Our only complaint is how long we are having to wait to get the collection! They released half of a season many months ago, and just now released the 2nd half of season 1. It could take years at this rate! Be careful with children -- many of these DVD's contain uncensored portions that are not appropriate for children or teens.",1193443200,,392,4.3108108108108105
2692582,2,B000KJU1FK,"I was so excited to find the British series and wholly disappointed when I discovered that ""The Complete Seasons 1 & 2"" were not at all complete. They only show a montage of scenes from Season 2 on the last disk of the set. If you're someone who likes to get their moneys worth, don't buy this product.",1191974400,2,302,4.224137931034483

I would like to say that I think it's just absurd that in a year time only 2 dvd's have come out. Please make the 3rd one a bit quicker, because I can't wait that long, greets from The Netherlands...",1189209600,3,370,4.152777777777778

Wow, that's just great!  I'll be able to tell my grandkids, ""I was alive when they released the first volume"" and they will be amazed.  And I can tell them what a DVD was, and give them a history lesson in archaic consumer electronics.",1188259200,62,420,4.32051282051282
2692585,5,B000KJU1FK,"My wife and I laugh out loud at this thing together.  How wonderful is that!  Plus, we get all excited when talking together about the show.  We like to discuss the situation in which we think each player--Drew, Ryan, Colin, Wayne, Greg, and Brad--is the funniest.  It feels SO GOOD to laugh!  And by the way, Laura Hall is awesome!",1188000000,6,332,4.466666666666667
2692586,5,B000KJU1FK,"This is guaranteed to make everybody laugh so loud the neighbours will think you are dying of laughter. These DVD's need to get out much more frequently, because this is really great improv-comedy. Drew, Colin, Ryan, Wayne and all the others are really giving you all you could hope for. I am from Norway, and until 18 months ago I had not heard of this show, but now it is my absolute favourite.",1186012800,5,396,4.438356164383562
2692587,4,B000KJU1FK,"For those who are fans of the American version, this may not really interest you. For those who are addicted to the British version, this is really worth investing in. While there are certainly some less-than-stellar moments, it is wonderful to see the show in it's most raw form and see it progress across the first season and into the second. This collection also features many games that were later scrapped like ""Authors"" which are exceedingly funny and far more intelligent than later episodes.

For the price, you can't miss. Also -- the packaging is marvelous and compact as opposed to a bundle of standard clunky large DVD cases. I can't wait for the rest of the series to come out so I can add them to my collection!",1186012800,2,725,4.62015503875969
2692588,5,B000KJU1FK,"""Whose Line"" producers/owners need to get on the ball!  PLEASE release these more quickly!  Season 1's 2 part, almost a year apart is just ridiculous.  It's a GREAT DVD, full of laughs!  Colin, Ryan, Wayne and the various guests are AWESOME - fantastic improv!!

2692589,5,B000KJU1FK,Am I the only one who thinks that these need to be released closer together?  I am one of the biggest fans of this show hands down and I think it took forever to release the second half of this season!  And I'll be waiting around again for as long as it takes to release the next one.,1184976000,7,284,3.8793103448275863
2692590,3,B000KJU1FK,"This collection cannot compare with the American version!  The last nine or ten episodes are pretty good, as are the compilations/out-takes, but overall there is simply no comparison.  Yes, there are brilliant and talented performers, and some funny moments, but it is simply not as side-splitting funny as the American version.",1184803200,3,328,5.411764705882353
2692591,3,B000KJU1FK,"Almost all great shows take a few seasons to really get rolling, and Whose Line is no exception.  The British Version of the show is by far superior to the American Version, but you really can't tell from the first two seasons.  I'm not sure how the sales for this set have been, but I hope that A&E will release the later seasons of the British Version, which leave the first two seasons in the dust.

Some good moments, but the show clearly isn't in its prime with this set.",1183593600,14,476,4.266666666666667

2692593,5,B000KJU1FK,"The American version of this game show is pale in comparison.  Watch this version and you will see how Ryan Stiles got his start on the show.  Warning - you must be ready to perhaps know a bit about world literature, theater, etc.to enjoy some of the games.

The idea of improvisational comedy with some accessible comedians being silly with and for an audience is pretty cool. These are obviously intelligent people with good language skill. But the content left something to be desired.",1520380800,,452,4.8076923076923075
