This is one case of a sequel surpassing the original and ramping up the level of excitement. They take the protagonists and pit them up against a threat that is much more dangerous than anything they dealt with previously. Not to mention the antagonists are much more fleshed out than with the original series. Sure, that series had a villain you could somewhat feel for...but still was a scumbag. These characters are doing bad things, but it gets across much earlier why they are doing it. It's much more emotional and you can sympathize with why they feel this is necessary.

It is also a good looking series. Even though it came out almost a decade ago and on DVD...it still looks good. The magic is well done, the action is good, and the characters are well drawn. I don't think a person could have any real complaints about how this looks. It has aged pretty well.

The show is worth getting if you can find it for an affordable price. I'd consider the franchise one of the classic magical girl series (that still is managing to hang in there with new spinoffs today). Good story, good action, and a likable main character. Worth buying if it's reasonable and if not...try to find it wherever you can.",1475452800,,1342,4.469387755102041
8314413,5,B001K98M46,I've been waiting for this to come on the market for a while so I was excited get to get it when it did. I greatly enjoyed it; an improvement over the first season.,1360713600,,164,3.8529411764705883
8314414,4,B001K98M46,"Alright if you have seen Nanoha season 1 get this.  If you haven't seen Nanoha 1 then don't buy that until you've got this.  Why? you may ask.  Simple, A's takes what Nanoha has and makes it better by a wide margin.  Here's what makes it so good.  1. A much better sense of tension pervades the series, not masterpiece level, but well, calling Nanoha a masterpiece means this must be your first anime.  2. Better villains. Season 1's Precia was flat, boring, and kinda bland looking.  She also showed up late and didn't present a strong challenge for very long.  Not so in Nanoha A's (reviewed here.) The villains come with purpose right from the opening episode and you get a small army of well developed, fun characters. No dilly dallying, it's go go go. with explanations later and decently spaced apart.  3. Animation...A's had a bigger budget and it shows.  If you've seen Nanoha prepare to see a show that looks the same, only better.  At its worst A's is giving off the very best animation its 1st season could muster. 4. It's rare, Nanoha season 1 isn't quite so rare, but it is often much more expensive (why would you want to be the proud owner of just the weaker budget breaking quarter?) but it's possible to find A's for reasonable prices, say in the realm of $20.  So all you budget conscious Nanoha A's hunters keep alert and watch for copies to show up.  If you can find it cheap A's will almost certainly turn out to be a good investment, whereas season 1 is woefully overpriced by itself, and barely worth the price with A's.

Last thoughts.  I would only recommend Nanoha to those who like the art style and magical girls beating on each other with magic, that's Nanoha's most distinctive characteristic since the storytelling and characters can often be a bit lacklustre.  There are many other shows of better quality available for significantly less, Try not to blow too much of the bank on it and you won't come away disappointed...I would avoid it unless you can get the two sets for under $200.  That'll pretty much knock you more casual viewers out of your curious stupor, but it may be just as well.  This series does not have broad appeal, that's kinda why the license for it expired and it's so expensive now.  For a similar show, i.e. magical girl, that's more consistently fun see either Puella Magi Madoka Magica, or Shakugan No Shana.  Both of which are also kind of pricy unfortunately.",1326153600,,2419,4.568445475638051
8314415,4,B001K98M46,"I saw this series online awhile ago and thought it was a good magical girl series(a genre that I'm not too crazy about). I enjoyed it a lot more than the first season. It's too bad that I didn't buy A's when it first came out, because now it's out of print, and I'm not willing to pay so much money for it. I do own the first season, which is a lot easier to get ahold of. So, if you enjoy cute magical girl Anime series, and have the cash, then go for it. Most will probably just stick to fansubs(like me), or unfortunately buy the bootleg.

EDIT: Just wanted to add that a few days after writing this, I went to my local Anime store and bought this same rare box set for less than $50. So look around and maybe you'll get luicky like I did. :)",1309132800,,745,3.966666666666667
8314416,4,B001K98M46,"I reported this to Amazon 3 weeks ago and got a response that they would update the product information.  This product description and picture is for Lyrical Nanoha A...yes the 'A' is a different season.  Season 2.  I almost bought this thinking is was the full season one (and not the Viridian edition which usually may have less goodies such as no inserts, etc.)  Still a good series.",1271116800,,386,4.632352941176471
8314417,5,B001K98M46,"This is season two of the Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha series. Things get a lot more complicated, and crazy. For the most part, the series takes its time explaining the situation of the characters. Just so you know, the flashbacks are limited, so there are no parts when you say ""Here comes the flashback"". Its interesting to see girls in elementary fighting each other, or fighting beings from other worlds.",1251417600,,407,4.828571428571428
8314418,5,B001K98M46,Both of my daughters 10 & 14 love anime.  It is a complex world to find anime that is both tame enough from adult anime and yet not so simplstic that you could categorize it with Barney.  I was lucky enough to find this series among others for my daughters.  It has a great Magical girl feel and while there is a hint of romance it; is not so in-depth that I need to restrict my 10 yr old from watching.,1242086400,4,403,3.950617283950617
