7922938,2,B00004TJMY,"This is not my normal foray into anime, but I caught it on cable and thought I'd give it a watch. The art and animation were great, and the story's hero is dark and tragic - that classic cool look.  However, this story's fascination with sex and ultraviolence really destroy any hopes of redeeming the story from the unlikable heap of sex and gore.  The story is of a private eye curious about the dealings of a night club owner and the mysterious offings of his old mates on the police force, who are really being killed by hypnotic pornographic figures seducing them.  Upon digging deeper into the case, he himself is almost offed, but he thwarts it with the mere loss of his eye, which is mysteriously replaced by someone who admires his courage (????).  He then gets the ultra cool abilities of controlling any computers with his left eye.
Inconceivability is usually passable in anime, but for heaven's sake, at least explain yourself a bit!  By the end of the piece, you hope to gather some information as to who gave him his ultra cool/almighty eye.  However, it's amazing we make it that far as we have to sit through even more sex and gratuitous violence.  Sometimes, you wish Goku would use his eye to turn off the telly or change the channel.
In a few short words, Goku is a cool dark hero, but is surrounded by too much sex and violence to establish himself as a good role model.  He also doesn't know how he got his inconceivable eye and neither do we.  His eye's all powerful and can do anything, so it's a wonder that something more constructive isn't done with it.  Sex, violence, and a hokey premise.  Pass this one up unless your due for a good vaccuming up of your brain cells.",990144000,,1696,4.456310679611651
7922939,4,B00004TJMY,"I really enjoyed the first tape of Goku: Midnight Eye, so I obviously wanted to see this one. This OAV is basically a small return to the world of Goku. The story is your basic woman-in-distress who wants Goku to help her brother who has gone completely insane and is a threat to everyone. Its pretty quick, but I wish it was longer. One thing I think worth noting is the classy James-Bond style opening. This video is mostly a could-have-been-better tape, but still, if you love Golgo 13 or just can't get enough of the nuclear premise and Goku's computer eye, than pick this one up.",982972800,,584,4.4672897196261685
7922940,2,B00004TJMY,"The anime Goku is sadly yet another title to add to the ultra violent, guilty pleasure anime bin. I thought the concept of a detective being given an artifical eye that can control every computer in the world to be  interesting. Yet my interest faded with the weak plot and paper thin  characters. If you enjoyed anime titles such as Golgo 13 you might enjoy  this, everyone else save your time for a better Anime such as Patlabor 2,  Princess Mononoke or Ghost in the Shell.",960940800,,475,4.488372093023256
