5564820,5,B00BAB6EEY,"Movie itself is not considered an ""A"" rating from a production perspective; probably due to low budget.....
However, the movie is a MUST see for Christians regarding our future.  Based on ""the future"" (about 20 years in the future) it relates the story of Christian people who must worship in secret....in order not to be arrested  by ""the state"" which has forbidden Christians to gather.  To tell the ending would ruin the movie.",1398988800,2,430,4.863013698630137
5564821,3,B00BAB6EEY,"So much relevant in modern day USA where Christianity is being labeled by some in our politically correct government as a ""hate group."" The message is strong, and the production is good, but the screenplay is not so much. Perhaps a re-edit can even clarify the storyline. Worth a watch for the idea, but the potential is so much greater for the concept.",1392336000,5,353,4.619047619047619
5564822,3,B00BAB6EEY,"This movie has a GREAT concept and potential plot...but whoever wrote the screenplay and did the directing did the project a great disservice.

Still watchable...and the themes are still powerful.  You'll just have to abide some painfully over-long and massively over-written scenes.  Way too much dialogue saying the same things over and over.

Again, great concept.  Just needed improved execution.  Perhaps a modest-sized studio could pick up the rights and do a do-over.",1389139200,,474,5.424657534246576
5564823,5,B00BAB6EEY,"I can't adequately describe how BAD this movie is, except to say that it's so bad it becomes AMAZING. You can't fake this level of ineptitude. Every level of this movie is drenched in sincerity and failure. None of the actors are able to convey any emotion, the writers clearly have no idea how the American government functions, the characters fight against ideologies that LITERALLY NO ONE holds, the music is never quite appropriate, it's set in 2030 but looks like 2003, the effects are hilarious, and the major ""terrorist attack"" was a mass email and magical hacking of ALL OF THE INTERNET.

Get some friends together, get drunk, and watch this movie. This is the Christian equivalent of The Room or Birdemic. Kick back, grab a drink, and enjoy the delicious, delicious fail.",1376956800,4,780,4.82089552238806
5564824,4,B00BAB6EEY,"A very encouraging and realistic film about the coming persecution of Christians.  Despite being a bit of an amateur production, still well-made with a CRITICAL message.  A Must-see.",1374278400,,182,5.464285714285714

5564826,3,B00BAB6EEY,"1) The movie is poorly written  2) lighting and sound are pretty bad  3) acting is horrendous, cardboard standees could have acted better  4) I don't think they used a makup artist during the entire film. The lead actors face was full of zits and such.

That said...

I would recommend this movie ONLY because of the message it has. This movie is NOT ABOUT RELIGION. Let's get that out of the way right now. What the movie is about is how the Progressive movement is stripping away our freedoms. One of the ways used to control people, thruought history, has been to abolish (control)religion. Controlling religion is used as the basis of the movie. But do not be fooled. The movie only uses the subject of religious control as a means to the ultimate goal of government which is to control citizens.

It's happening today, right now, which is what the film is trying to get across. Had this film been graced with a bigger budget, better directing and better acting (add in a few A-list actors), it would probably have been a major hit with lots of controversy to follow it's release. As it stands, it is very low budget and the message suffers (and is ignored)because of it.

Personally, I would not pay to own this film. I still recommend it just for the message (if you can stomach the acting).",1372032000,,1297,4.517094017094017
8564834,4,B00BAB6EEY,"This film predicts exactly the time here and now - at this very moment.  Since the election of Manchurian Candidate Barry Hussein Obama,  If one is Christian, one is fired from both government and non-government jobs.  If a business is Christian, like Chick Fil A, the business is boycotted and ridiculed even to the extent of Hollywood boycott.  If one is a Christian in school, one is punished from elementary to secondary level and cannot express any opinions in any secular university.  At any time, may be openly mocked by things like ""Piss Christ""  (supported at the taxpayer expense) and poop on the Virgin, etc.  We have now returned to the era of Diocletion in terms of government and secular persecution.  If you attended a snowflake fraud public skrool, you will probably have to research Diocletion and those times.  ""Freedom of Silence"" is spot on",1528934400,,860,4.875862068965517
8564835,3,B00BAB6EEY,"Poor production value. Some of the acting is bad, like when the interrogator backhands his suspect, it looked stupid. Also, I'm guessing this film was completed around 2004 but is just being released. It's suppose to be around the year 2030 in everyday middle America. Of course there's not much style wise that would drastically change over 25 years so it's no big deal on that front but blackberries date it. Anyway, to its theme..,it's not unlike other dystopian themes where a future without certain freedoms exist. In this one its religious freedom...though you might imagine if that's censored then other areas would be too. Now, people who say the message of the film is ""fanatical"" I'm not convinced of that because we know that Nazi Germany went after Jews and in China (TPR) has certain sanctions on the quality of religious practices, with N Korea encouraging agnosticism, and I believe parts of the Eastern world banning certain literature and practices. So it's not that far fetched. When a government gets involved in legislating peoples spiritual practices, it's called fascism. What's lame is that if you were going to secretly practice religion under an authoritarian dictatorship, and wanted to send a public message, why would you not do it from a secret location? So the guy suffers needlessly. But the message is that if a society doesn't protect itself from heavy handed governments you end up with freedoms removed and then pay a price if you break that law.",1512000000,,1481,4.951807228915663

8564839,1,B00BAB6EEY,"What a complete pile of garbage.
The only reason I'm watching this trash is to laugh at its stupidity.
Nonsensical Christian propaganda. Feeding on Christians persecution complex.
You have every right to believe in nonsense and we have the right to make fun of you for it.
You'll always have that right. Who else would we laugh at.",1467763200,2,331,4.724137931034483
8564840,1,B00BAB6EEY,"This is one of the worst movies ever made in the entire history of movie making. And I've seen Battlefield Earth, so I'm not just being needlessly hyperbolic. The ridiculous writing would be laughable, if it weren't an indictment of how dangerously paranoid certain elements of the religious right are becoming. Needless to say, the acting is also quite atrocious.

If there is one redeeming feature of this film, it's that it presents an excellent opportunity to peek behind the curtain of extreme Christian paranoia, though you might not like what you see. If you can tough it out for more than a few minutes, there is a scene fairly early in the film that is just such an exquisite example of a straw-man paranoid rant. You'll know which one I mean once you hear the ice cream analogy.",1464307200,2,788,4.669064748201439

8564842,2,B00BAB6EEY,"*** Contains Spoilers ***

Anyone remember ""The Handmaid's Tale?"" Movies like ""The Freedom of Silence"" are equal time for that. The indie shoestring-budget version, yes, but equal time.

In a 2030 that doesn't seem to differ at all from the present day, Christianity is banned for reasons that are unclear except that it's ""intolerant"" and has some disagreements on whether there's such a thing as absolutes (though I've never heard anyone actually say this).

Our hero, Zach, is the leader of a secret home church who recruits a whiz-tech sailor for a scheme to conquer all television and e-mail for one night. (The movie description says the sailor is a Navy SEAL, but you'd never guess it looking at him. He looks like a swabbie.) No coifed televangelists in suits, no begging, but simply sharing the gospel with the whole world. It's basic, it's heartfelt and, from what I've read in the Bible myself, right on target. If only all TV evangelism was done that way.

Zach is arrested and beaten by a government official. Naturally, the official is the very epitome of bitter atheism; naturally, our hero never even begins to crack. In fact, he makes the official even madder by quoting Bible verses, which brings on more torture, to which he responds with another quote, which enrages his nemesis still more, which brings on still worse punishment, to which he responds by...

Predictably, the film sticks like glue to the Evangelical family-centric formula. We're treated to the mandatory wedding scene, the childbirth scene; and about a fourth of the film is just Zach bidding his spouse a tender goodbye when it's time to go invade the airwaves. (A street preacher reminds us early on that we're not forced to read the Bible. But we are forced to sit through these focusings on the family.)

The sailor's love interest, who's a single mom (family, remember) turns out to be a double agent, which provides a moderately interesting subplot, as well as a tense moment in the rain involving a gun.

The film does have a real-life precedent. In the 1970's, a KGB agent named Sergei Kourdakov defected to Canada and told of his career raiding secret Christian meetings, beating up the participants and hauling them off to jail. There was a government-sanctioned church in the Soviet Union at the time, just as there is in the movie. And the police attacked unauthorized groups and gatherings, as is done in the movie.

But the film might pack more of a punch, or even a warning--Sinclair Lewis' novel ""It Can't Happen Here"" comes to mind--if there'd been more of a budget, a less formulaic script, and characters allowed to have than one dimension.",1436918400,,2647,4.84070796460177
8564843,2,B00BAB6EEY,"A very slow moving film.  The plot is hard to follow and it's boring.
One of the worst movies I've seen.
I had to shut it off after about 45 minutes.",1424736000,,149,3.806451612903226
