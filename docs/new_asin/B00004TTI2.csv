I don't recommend it and you should get the dvd one instead.",1456963200,,150,4.033333333333333
7923097,4,B00004TTI2,The video works well and does the job it was purchased for. Thanks,1448496000,,66,4.153846153846154
7923098,5,B00004TTI2,Very fun video,1420416000,,14,4.0
7923099,4,B00004TTI2,"Great product for the Holidays. It's a good 3 hours in length, however, the soundtrack got old after a while - it needed to have a longer playlist. Perfect condition.",1231200000,,166,4.566666666666666
7923100,5,B00004TTI2,"This video is a good mix of atmosphere and music.  Music is a blend of traditional pieces, with bits of fireplace crackling interspersed.  The fireplace crackling fades to the background and does not interrupt the music.  The fire is lively enough to keep you interested.  It was perfect to bring the season to a condo in Florida.  The video will play again next Christmas.  Excellent choice.",1200009600,,392,4.863636363636363
7923101,5,B00004TTI2,I was very happy to find this video available on VHS tape.  As we don't have a fireplace it was fun to put it on our 15 inch TV in the room where we had our Christmas tree.  Turned out to be quite a conversation piece.  The service from the company was great.,1168473600,,259,3.849056603773585
7923102,2,B00004TTI2,The christmas music sounds like it is coming from an elevator in a...store. Even worse you can't hear the fire sounds.,1033689600,8,118,4.666666666666667
7923103,3,B00004TTI2,"The fires good, but they play the same song twice in a row before they start the next one.  (...)",1008288000,7,97,3.85
7923104,4,B00004TTI2,"Our house doesn't have a fireplace.  The only time I really miss it is during the holidays.  I bought this video for our annual tree trimming party to try to bring some ""visual warmth"" into the house (this three hour one is perfect).  I played it on our 52"" tv and it was a hit.  All of our neighbors were mesmerized and couldn't take their eyes off of it.  We would watch for the guy to poke at the fire or throw on another log.  I had no idea it would be such a conversation piece.  Now I am looking for one with an aquarium.",1007596800,4,527,3.961904761904762
