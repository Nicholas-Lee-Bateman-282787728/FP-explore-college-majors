8518881,2,B007K7IC24,"Not much of a film either. Short film at 68 minutes but the story doesn't need any more than that. The title character is Saejima Rin, a female swordmaster that has been tasked to find the source of an illegal drug at the imperial court that acts as an aphrodisiac for women but eventually kills them after a while. She enlists the aid of Yasuboro, a commoner that gives her medical aid when she flees the palace. She thanks him and dutifully repays him. The acting is okay for low budget fare but the sword fighting is laughable. The story progresses with Yasuboro investigating a former serving girl about possible leads. She tells him about the head wench being involved in the drug trade after he performs a needed personal favor for her. This later leads to her death by the headwoman who convinces Yasuboro she is innocent. Yasuboro falls for the set up and is trapped in an ambush and Mistress Rin must rescue him. The real person behind all this is revealed and our heroic duo seems doomed but with quick action the henchmen are dispatched and Mistress Rin faces off against the villain. The film is rated R but does not have graphic violence.",1383523200,2,1151,4.565217391304348
8518882,4,B007K7IC24,"Sultry Assassin Aphrodisiac Kill is a guilty pleasure. The acting is low and the action is even lower, but you don't watch this kind of movie for the acting and action. It's the cute girls and sex scenes that you watch this kind of movie for. And the main actress Asami is not only cute, but she also has a hot sex scene.",1353628800,8,321,4.111111111111111
