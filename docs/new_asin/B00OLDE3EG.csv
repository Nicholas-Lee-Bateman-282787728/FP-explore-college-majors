8684104,5,B00OLDE3EG,My kids love this DVD and will often watch many more tracks than I assign them for our homeschool work.  As a busy homeschool mom I find this a great resource for the many times I just don't have time to setup an experiment myself.  It's definitely enhanced our learning experience!,1445558400,,282,4.509803921568627
