8473144,5,B005HI4LLE,"""Priscilla Howe is a master at her storytelling craft. In 'The Itsy Bitsy Tiger' DVD, you get to see Priscilla work her magic.  This 43-minute adventure is filled with solid and entertaining storytelling with expertly-timed comedic moments that induce wails of laughter from the children in her audience. Children watching this DVD will most likely find themselves gesturing along with the audience as Priscilla weaves story and song together.

At times the camera work is a bit clunky, but your children won't notice it. Priscilla has extensive skills as a storyteller that override the occasional odd camera work.

While Priscilla uses the music and puppets well, she is foremost a storyteller and it shows. This isn't a puppeteer or a musician using storytelling as a side-note to her presentations. Rather, it's an internationally-traveled and very talented storyteller intent on delivering great stories to and with her young audience- and you get to come along via the video.

The DVD contains 8 titles and runs about 43 minutes. The suggested ages for the title are 3-10 and we agree. They'll be laughing, singing and finger-playing along.

Finally, watch the video until the very end to see Priscilla and the puppets interact with the audience after the show. So many children's performers vanish at the end of their set. Priscilla lingers while letting the children get close up with these little characters they have learned to love in the last hour. It's in moments like these where you see the 'heart' of a talented teller.
