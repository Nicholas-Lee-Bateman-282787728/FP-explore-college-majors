4587960,5,B0056EBHX4,I ordered this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend.  We watched the first season and I'm now hooked.  This show is awesome!,1356739200,,127,4.478260869565218
4587961,5,B0056EBHX4,"Just what I expected. Awesome show! Venture Bros. is funny, smart, well produced. Highly recommended, unless you don't like fun :)",1354060800,,130,5.238095238095238
4587962,5,B0056EBHX4,"5 stars for the show, no stars for having disc 1 of season 41 broken in half, prob won't happen to anyone else tho",1353715200,2,114,3.7916666666666665
4587963,3,B0056EBHX4,"While this is simply a marvelous show, these DVD's leave some thing to be desired. To begin with Season 1's disc inner ring came broken, and while the dvd works, if I were to even slightly bend it it would crack further rendering the disc useless. The cases for season 1 & 2 are made so you can only get it out via divets on the top of the protecting ring, the bottom two are sealed for whatever reason, causing the DVDs duress when getting them out.",1353542400,,450,4.183908045977011
4587964,5,B0056EBHX4,"The DVD's came in very good condition (New) and The Venture Brothers is an incredible show anyways. Pretty good price, i'm happy with my purchase and I can't wait to watch the rest of the series ^^ !",1348963200,2,199,4.2631578947368425
8459474,5,B0056EBHX4,"These programs are addictive. The only down side is that some of the hubs that hold the DVDs are so difficult to
release that one could easily break the DVD getting it out of the slipcover. I know someone who actually snapped
a disc in two getting it out.",1407369600,,255,4.224489795918367
8459475,5,B0056EBHX4,Be patient with it and the payoff will have you on your ass. Devastating humor and head swimming cultural references.,1406246400,,117,4.9
8459476,5,B0056EBHX4,"Loved it. I had no idea that the videos had actually been censured for television. I had only seen some of Season 3 and later so I got to see where some of the craziness started. It can get repititous; the Monarch gets a little old, but otherwise enjoyable.",1395792000,,257,4.26530612244898
8459477,1,B0056EBHX4,"As another reviewer pointed out, this set is far from the best deal available on Amazon.

I just purchased (1/2/14):
Season 1: $14.49
Season 2  $14.99
Season 3  $14.99
Season 4 1&2:  $19.98
Season 5 Pre-Order: $21.23
GRAND TOTAL w Prime Shipping:  $85.68

It is certainly in your best interest to remain patient and wait for the same or better deals to pop up.  Save you quite a bit of money.  There is no bonus, box, or special features that this set offers vs. buying them for cheaper individually.  Add to the fact that they all will ship together and this collection is WAY over priced.",1388620800,,590,4.490566037735849
8459478,5,B0056EBHX4,"We choose that  series because we didn't have the time to watch it , we heard that was a good series. Delivery was fast packaging was safe",1380067200,,138,4.111111111111111
8459479,5,B0056EBHX4,"If you're buying this you already know what it is. If you don't, buy it anyway - you will not be disappointed.",1375315200,,110,4.045454545454546
8459480,4,B0056EBHX4,"I thought it strange that some of the dvd's in this package deal where edited and some where not.  It sort of bothered me,that half where censored and half where not.  I feel they should all be edited or they all should not be, not half and half.  Other than that, I received them quickly and in good condition.",1373587200,3,311,4.237288135593221
8459481,3,B0056EBHX4,"Agreeing with a previous review. Buying these discs in bulk does not save you money. Also, there was no regard for the packaging as there was tape wrapped around all of the dvds which has peeled some of the covers.  I paid the ""new"" price and wonder if I received ""used"".  Buy them separately and you'll save money and hassle.",1370822400,5,326,4.416666666666667
8459482,2,B0056EBHX4,"Current prices for Venture Bros. DVDs on this site:
Season 1: $13.49
Season 2: $14.49
Season 3: $13.99
Season 4, Vol 1: $10.49
Season 4, Vol 2: $10.99

Grand total: $63.45

Price of the bulk package (Seasons 1-4 together): $90.99

I can't in good faith recommend the bulk package because it's a blatant waste of money. Even if you take off the sale prices, the bulk package is still more expensive than buying the individual seasons separately ($129.92 vs $133.82).",1370217600,42,465,4.7875
8459483,5,B0056EBHX4,I love to watch the adventures of Dr. Venture and Dean and Hank.  It is adult humor and has foul language so not for kids.,1361577600,,122,3.88
