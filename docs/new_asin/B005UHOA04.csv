Glenn Black does not merely demonstrate asana, but shows very key joint mobilization and 'yoga calisthenics' I have not come across elsewhere, at least in not as complete a package.

A great value, highly recommend.",1402444800,,283,4.875
8486844,4,B005UHOA04,"I appreciate the thoroughness of the dvd in some aspects.  That being said, I did not like the short section where he shows postures that you can learn to do, but does not teach how to do them.  Also, the advertisement for this dvd should specify that it was filmed a very long time ago.  It is also somewhat boring.  I do not need bells and whistles, but the sound was odd at times.  I would give it five stars if I was released twenty years ago.  But to be released recently, it could have had more in terms of material and production.  If it was half the price, then I would recommend it.  Otherwise, save your money or buy Max Strom's dvd, which is also somewhat boring but a great dvd and more thorough.",1327276800,3,708,4.192592592592592
8486845,5,B005UHOA04,"I've studied with Glenn many times at Omega Institute in Rhinebeck, NY and was thrilled to find out that he has a DVD available. Glenn has a profoundly deep understanding of yoga and anatomy and when you put that together with years of teaching experience you end up with a teacher who can help you learn to practice correctly, safely and deeply. His approach is very holistic creating a balance between strength and flexibility. This video was made earlier in Glenn's career but it's excellent and I highly recommend it. Glenn also has a DVD for ""Body Tuning"" that I highly recommend as well.",1325635200,,593,4.711538461538462
