6412856,5,B00KB01MJM,"I had already ordered Seasons 1-4. Which were just awesome. I've watched Matt Dillon all my life. Had I known you could have bought seasons 1-5 as a bundle, I surely would have, and saved money doing so. When I ordered this set, I ordered Season 5 at the same time. So now I have Seasons 1thru 10. I'm ready to cancel my cable. This DVD set is great. Seasons 1-5 are all 1/2 hour segments. Beginning with Season 6 or 7 I believe is when the 1 hour segments began, I think I'm correct. But all still in Black & White. For me I lost interest in the series after it turned to color and Matt became less involved in the story line. Which was somewhere after season 10.  But these are seriously good. Very entertaining. And buying at the bundle price versus season by Season is certainly the only way to go. The quality of these sets are very good. You can play chapter by chapter, or just hit Play All, and sit back and relax and watch the entire DVD without having to budge. Each Season DVD is divided into 3 DVD's per season. So for season 6, there are two DVD's and so forth. The only one of the series complete on one DVD is Season 1. Which is a must have for any serious fan. Matt gets shot up the very first episode. But just to be clear, Season 1-5 is available as a bundle also. And these are so well worth the money. Thank you Amazon so much for making these available.",1470960000,14,1374,4.126865671641791

We are sad to see Chester leave in season 9. But new characters or actors have joined, including Burt Reynolds. Also, the various guest are great, some were not famous then, but they are now.

Amazing what we missed when we could only see Gunsmoke over low quality broadcast television with all those fuzzy horizontal lines. But Gunsmoke was still good back then.  These are good quality DVDs that reveal more detail than what we missed on the TV Boob Tube: where you can renew your laughs at good ole' Chester; see what was then INCREDIBLY revealing Miss Kitty (Meow!), and; hope and pray you'll never have to ""come see"" Doc Adams!

Our nation's cops and law abiding citizens should take a survival lesson from Marshall Dillon: ""Forget getting Pepper Sprayed, Forget getting Tazered: Draw on me and I'll bury you on Boot Hill!""

Thank God we still can share these more ethical and conservative series with our children and grandchildren (especially ""Gunsmoke"") because the crappy and immoral series they have on now are helping to lead this nation to a Sodom and Gomorrah-type Wrath from God.

Stay Safe,
...Chappy (aka GhillieMan)",1477180800,5,941,4.936708860759493

6412894,4,B00KB01MJM,Love the one hour Gunsmoke episodes.  Arrived quickly but was disappointed in the condition of the containers.  The DVD's play good but the containers are plastic and 98% of them have pieces broken off inside.,1475798400,4,209,4.942857142857143
6412895,3,B00KB01MJM,"I am happy with the series.  Unfortunately here in Australia we can only get seasons 1 & 2.  That said they are of higher video quality, as season six from the USA is more a little grainy.  Also I wish that like the Australian packaging the USA packaging could be one case for the entire seasons.

That said I do enjoy the series.",1471651200,2,330,4.190476190476191

8657159,5,B00KB01MJM,The second five years of a western series that lasted on TV for twenty years from 1955 to 1975. Season 6 to 10 were from 1960 to 1965. An interesting adult western with engaging characters. Gunsmoke was a radio show in the late 40's and early 50's. I notice that some of the TV episodes came from the radio scripts.,1519776000,,315,4.266666666666667
