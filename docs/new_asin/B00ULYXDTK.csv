8707366,1,B00ULYXDTK,"I was expecting so much more from this dvd. It was just pretty much 1.5 hrs (I think) of footage documenting the behind the scenes so to speak of what went on in Kiev back then. People walking back and forth.....food being prepared.....people sleeping.....things burning.....I don't know. They didn't even interview anyone. I watched patiently for about 15 minutes an then couldn't take it no more and had to fast forward to see what happens next. This was a great opportunity to do something major and all it is -is just some footage someone had discovered after the fact and was lazy to even do anything more significant with it, add things etc. It's a waste of time.  I think the description of this feature is misleading and makes you expect way more than you get. I love documentaries! This one is a disappointment.",1434585600,,820,4.694444444444445
8707367,4,B00ULYXDTK,"This is a really stark film that chronicles the events that occurred in Freedom Square, Kiev at the end of 2013 to early 2014. The people were sick of the corrupt government of Yanukovych and his clique of lick spittles in hock to Putin - allegedly that is. Events came to a head when he decided to move away from closer ties with the European Union and lean towards Russia.

The film starts by showing us what happens at a demo, there are lots of shots of not very much happening and for the first 15 minutes or so that is all we get - but please do bear with it - it is very much worth it.

Then we see things like building the barricades the various speeches and a lot of poetry some good some less so. They also like to burst into song too which includes the Ukrainian National Anthem (by the way all National Anthems are the same all about being better than anyone else and beating up enemies and stuff - except the French one which is the best as it's got a good chorus). Still I digress, then things change when on 16 January the government passes radical laws that outlaw the protesters and the police or Berkut are sent in.

This is mostly filmed with fixed camera angles and the camera tells the story as an observer - except for as on a very few occasions. This is often about the ordinary, the soup kitchen is as important as the barricade maker for instance. Then when the bloody street battles kick off it takes on a much more sinister hue. That is when the fragility of people comes through but also the strength of unity and some scenes are incredibly moving and upsetting.

This is a film that has a feel of having made itself but a lot of effort, belief and courage went behind and in front of those cameras and it stands as a fitting tribute to those who stood up for their rights and sadly those who lost their lives.",1431648000,2,1837,4.24
