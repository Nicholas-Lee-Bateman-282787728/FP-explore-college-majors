8323733,4,6302041295,"Along with his  first movie <MORE>, Barbet Schroeder worked with Pink Floyd, a legendary progressive rock band for the soundtrack.
But not like his first film, this second movie, the music was not that important since it was only used as background sound and it was barely being heard.
It was visual that is more matter in this movie.
You see it was a hippie era of the late 60's-early 70's that would make a great addition to any collector of this genre of film. Along with Schroeder's ""More"", Max Steuer's ""The Committee"", Roy Battersby's ""The Body"",  Michelangelo Antonioni's ""Zabriskie Point"", and George Greenough's surfing documentary ""Crystal Voyager"".
I happen to saw <ZABRISKIE POINT> along with <BLOW UP> I bacame a fan of Antonioni instantly because of the <ZABRISKIE> movie. IT was
that powerful to describe the hippie style I guess.

The story is about this woman who is searching for unique feathers who happens to go to this deserted valley 'Obscured by clouds' and experiences sex freedom enjoys the nature and primitive culture and ends up with gains what she wants.

The story is mixed with real documentary films that he shot with native people who live in the valley.
They dance, they do whatever they do for daily lives. They don't even care about who is watching. Not even dress properly.
They do the dancing, ceremony eats the pigs, kill pigs alive in the most brutal way.
The camera shows everything without filtering anything at all. If they have shot anything like this in America that way, they whould have had a strong protest against Animal brutality.

The woman even though has married to a French Consul would not deny having sex with a man who he thinks is cool who takes her to this tribe to get the feathers.
She also have sex with this other man who has great body too.
She is a hippie all right.
It just doesn't felt like she is all promiscuous for some reason.
It felt more like total freedom to me that she is doing all that.
Maybe it's because it was rated 15 and the director didn't show her being nude.
At least she is not doing this for money or something that she want to achieve.
It's something that she is wanting to do purely.
Isn't it what hippie is all about?

The movie is a slow one not like his first feature <MORE> which is also combination work with PINK FLOYD.
You should get use to the phase or you will get bored with docu-style and all.

But once you get use to it, like the title -Obscure by cloude- you will feel like being in some kind of a dream like state.
A very calm and steady island. Nothing to worry about.
Everyone seems quiet and come down. They walk slow, talk slow.

Barbet Schroeder later makes movies like <SINGLE WHILE FEMALE><MURDER BY NUMBERS><REVERSAL OF FORTUNE> in Hollywood. He also makes hit movies like <Matresse> in France his country after two artsy films with Pink Floyd.",1464566400,,2856,4.586274509803921
