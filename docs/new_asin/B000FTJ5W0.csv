In this chilling follow up to ""Murder After Dark"" things begin to happen which blows a hole into the solved case of the Margaret Ray murder. With the killer behind bars everyone should be safe, right? Officer Nicholson (Patricia Poindexter) doesn't think so. She tries to convince Sheriff Bob Shirley (Karl Peterson) that the killer behind bars is working with someone or may even be innocent. Sheriff Bob doesn't want to hear it. But while he ignores officer Nicholson the body count rises. No one is safe in the town of Deep Woods. No one!

The killer escapes and claims innocence. No one believes him. His only proof is in a coma and dying. He finds out the Margaret Ray was not a random murder but instead killed because she knew something about certain town officials. Officials who have enough power to destroy anyone they want. To create a cover-up that is flawless. What they don't realize is that someone is on to them and lurks in the forest waiting for the right time to expose them.

Time is delicate and life is too short. If this case isn't solved quickly a lot of people will end up dead. The entire cast is back in this more dramatic and dark sequel. It is full of horror, mystery, and drama, with a splash of comedy. In part one you were given a shocking and surprising ending but that is nothing compared to the ending you will see here.

This roller coaster ride will take you all the way through the end and have you begging for more. This compelling story is twice the movie part one was. With it's beautiful scenic images and it's compelling music you will hate to see it all come to a final end!

Mike Burke is back as writer, producer, director and star. This time he plays a total of seven characters. Also stars Candice Mannachia as Detective Stockwell's girlfriend, who risks her life to help him and keep him safe",1164585600,,2049,4.482573726541555
