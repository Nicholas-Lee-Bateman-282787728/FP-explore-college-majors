The way things are broken down is awesome, and they are so ""at home""  I am now in process of purchasing prior years so I can catch up to the ""2014""'s  :)....

8234640,5,B000Z27HS6,"The first book I ever reviewed at Amazon was Cook's Illustrated's The Best Recipe. That book taught me how to write recipes. I didn't know that years later Christopher Kimball would have his own cooking show and that it would be the funniest cooking show I'd ever seen. Since I don't have cable TV or watch any regular TV either I just discovered these DVDs at Netflix. Call me old-fashioned but some things are worth the wait. I'm also at the place in my life where I have a Cuisinart Food processor and a Kitchen Aid Mixer. I've been using them and feeling like a chef. When watching this DVD I realized that pretty much every recipe requires either a food processor or mixer. So technically I would not have been able to make any of these recipes without them.

The recipes themselves? Well they are very precise. Everything seems based on science. The science of good cooking that is. You will learn a lot about technique, but even more importantly you will learn the exact brand of chocolate to use in your baking. Duplicating the recipe? That may take some effort. The test kitchen had all the supplies on hand. You may need to shop for an icing spreader or a specific cake baking pan. When they tell you which items to buy that is a good time to take notes! I have a few things I need to buy. So don't worry, you can find pretty much everything at amazon and have it in your possession in a matter of days.

The recipes on this DVD are also printable if you put the DVD into your computer.

What I liked most about these cooking classes was the quick tips, the equipment recommendations and the food facts. Who knew all the uses for allspice? I also liked that the chefs used whisks a lot. I do that. If you have spent almost forty years in various kitchens you've probably organically picked up a lot of these ideas. But for new cooks all the shortcuts will be a revelation.

Their apple pie is however far too complicated to make. Precooking the apples takes a lot of effort. I'll stick with my grandmother's recipe that uses a lot more spices. They really skimp on cinnamon.

While the cooks seem to bake with a lot of care they do seem a bit in a hurry. I suppose time is money but I like cooking at a more leisurely pace.

Some of the recipes featured on this DVD include: White cake, apple pie, molasses spice cookies, corn muffins, chocolate mousse cake, creme brulee, brownies and spritz cookies.

From Cook's Illustrated magazine I always got the impression that Christopher Kimball was a serious guy who did a lot of difficult research. On this DVD he is laugh-out-loud funny. His chemistry with the chefs/cooking testers is unbelievably good. I seriously have never enjoyed a cooking show more.

8234641,4,B000Z27HS6,"As expected and excellent as always.  Though could pack in some more recipes to justify the title and cost.

The reviews are good.",1356652800,3,130,4.608695652173913
8234642,3,B000Z27HS6,"While I love America's Test Kitchen in every respect, this DVD will not give you the results you are looking for if you live in a high-altitude. I live at 7,500 ft and none of these recipes work. To be a successful high-altitude baker, you must get a baking book or dvd that is specific to high altitude living.

To that end, I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pie-in-the-Sky-Successful-Baking-at-High-Altitudes-100-Cakes-Pies-Cookies-Breads-and-Pastries-Home-tested-for-Baking-at-Sea-Level-3-000-5-000-7-000-and-10-000-feet-and-Anywhere-in-Between/dp/0060522585/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pie in the Sky Successful Baking at High Altitudes: 100 Cakes, Pies, Cookies, Breads, and Pastries Home-tested for Baking at Sea Level, 3,000, 5,000, 7,000, and 10,000 feet (and Anywhere in Between).</a>

Now then, what this DVD will give you is great technique. If you're new to baking, it's always a good idea to 'see', with one's own eyes, just what the technique is by observing how it's done. In this regard, I highly recommend this DVD.",1345593600,4,1084,6.573426573426573

8234644,3,B000Z27HS6,"This is not a must have DVD. It covers 9 recipes. Summer fruit tart, deep dish apple pie, classic white layer cake, chocolate mousse cake, corn muffins w/variations, creme brulee, classic brownies, spritz cookies, and molasses spice cookies.
We got this for the creme brulee recipe. and it looks great. We will try it soon and know it will come out fine because everything we have done from America's test kitchen does.
So it comes down to, are 9 recipes worth 11-18 dollars? Unless you need constant instruction every time you cook something, We don't think so.
Most of these recipes are available on their website or their subscription cooksillustrated website. not to mention their myriad volumes of cook books.
The equipment reviews seem to be pointless for a DVD. In 10 years none of the products will exist.

The printable recipes from your computer worked just fine from my OSX machine. which are all accessible through a HTML file that navigates well. Acrobat required to view/print recipes.

Bottom line. If they supplied more recipe content unique to the DVD and eliminated the pointless equipment reviews. this would have been a better product.
If you can get it from the other sellers for less than 5 bucks get it. But Its not worth 20",1231977600,21,1247,4.822429906542056
