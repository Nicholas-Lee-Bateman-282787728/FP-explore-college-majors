1344378,5,B00004RZ01,"This is a beautifully, sad, nostalgic movie with Jack Nicholson that is well worth watching. It has the pull of Nicholson films, yet appears to b more of a dramatic play set in the early turn of the century. The setting is that of poverty & hardship, yet Jack floats through all his hardships with that way about him that is carefree, doesn't let anyone get him down, & basically makes the poverty of the times easier to bear. I watched it twice & love anything Nicholson is in.",1516752000,,478,4.382022471910112

1344383,5,B00004RZ01,"I just re-watched this because I was missing Albany. I realized that it still feels that way there. Spooky.

Tom Waits, Jack Nicholson, and Meryl Streep are all fantastic in this film. Really, everyone and everything is so realistic, it is really haunting. If you haven't seen it, you really ought to.",1481932800,,301,4.788461538461538
1344384,5,B00004RZ01,"This is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I know that some may call it too long, too slow, and too depressing. To me, this film reflects the early films of the 1970's in terms of just making a film about characters in another long gone place or lifestyle.  Whether it be the locations or the camerawork, you can tell this is a film that is rooted in authentic detail; the streets of 1938 Albany NY look like a very unforgiving place to be. And I have no doubt that the detail brought into this by the filmmakers across the board reflecting this time are true to what they want to convey. It is certainly not for everyone, but if you are fortunate enough to have it grab you, it is hard to forget.

Director Hector Babenco and author William Kennedy(who wrote the screenplay based on his timeless novel...) are to be commended for keeping their vision true. These are two people who know what they are doing, and they don't compromise...

The film covers the lives of some very complex characters; some of their misfortunes and pasts are more spelled out for you(Francis...), while others are left for you to wonder about what might have been in their lives in the past(Helen...). Francis(Nicholson) is dealing with reconciliation in many different ways, where Helen appears to be struggling with some glory days that have passed and were never recaptured for whatever reason(s). The sadness & situations they encounter though are never beaten to death; there are no generic, long scenes by the hospital bed or even any dwelling on the fate(s) that surely awaits some of these characters. Tom Waits' Rudy is brilliant(he steals most scenes he is in, and his character manages to be joyous about life despite his situation; He reads and brushes his teeth at the same time in the soup kitchen, and is always trying to learn; the chemistry of/and friendship between him and Francis is seamless, and Waits' final gaze at Francis will bring tears to your eyes(if nothing else does...). And while he mentions his cancer in the first 7 minutes of the film, it is not mentioned again except in a passing comment. The brutal situations & conditions are presented in a very almost matter of fact kind of way, like this is what you could have expected back then, and it really wasn't all that surprising to hear things of that nature. Even some of the characters that seem to be on their feet(inc. Fred Gwynne in an awesome part as the bartender; he was an alcoholic who landed back on his feet, but you know he had seen his bad days for sure...).

This is a film about good people(Francis is always caught up in 'what's fair'...)who were unlucky. And it is just as easy for that to happen to anyone. I saw that in Helen, who appears to me to have had a fairly successful music career & a family; she is a woman who wants to surround herself with the things she once found comfort in, even if it means getting it out of the pawn shop; you can see it as she gazes at the dresses in the store windows, and tries to maybe bring back a feeling of home by sitting by the fireplace in the public library. I think she had a grand life, and you can see she was probably the last one standing in her clan. Her singing in the bar to Francis is not only an amazing performance and song by Streep, but the camerawork(as it often does here...), follows the scene around in one constant shot, again bringing to mind the older school films of no cuts, and really putting your talent on the spot in terms of acting chops and getting the scene perfect. No easy way outs in that respect.  I reminds me of a lot of Kubrick's work in that way. He was notorious for the long sequences, and even more notorious for a massive amount of retakes...

Francis is a man with a moral compass in there somewhere; it shows whether he is taking off his only coat to help Helen warm up, buying her flowers, or the even the feeling he was disgraced and needed to leave his previous situation out of shame, perhaps out of the feeling that he couldn't be welcomed, deserving, or loved there anymore over his misstep; I think he left because he thought it would be better for his family if he was gone, only to find out 22 years later that is not the case. He is a gentleman, a guardian, a man who works very hard for very little, and doesn't spend his time complaining about much of anything. Yet his past has never slipped far from his memory, and you can tell he has been saddled for several decades from his own self-inflicted punishment & exile; and while he tries to mend the past and reconnect, he is also a big enough man to realize that he can't go back once he does. Carroll Baker is outstanding as his devoted wife who has clearly waited 22 years for him...

It is a heartbreaking film with out a doubt, but I still felt as though it served as an example of how you are still the same person you were regardless of your physical/material wealth. This is a movie about some very beautiful people who still mean something.  The last scene on the train with Francis and his hallucination on the train is pretty intense to me: you can tell when he realizes what he saw was not there, he was so angry at himself(whether for the booze issue. the running away, or both...). There is a true passion as he grabs his bottle and smashes it in a very vivid moment of self-realization of a life that was tragically derailed in so many ways.  And of course, the last shot and voice-over regarding the morning light(and what it stands for in the scope of the film...)is the perfect ending, and puts everything in place.

It is interesting to me how the stigma of being a 'bum' is something that the adults in the film look down upon, while the children in the film don't hold any type of stereotype to the person or run away. They treat them as though they are just normal people. This is quite evident in the scene with Francis and his grandson. Francis is instantly excepted by him, and you can see the grandson reveling in the tales of Francis' glory days as a ball player. And you can see how it affects Francis, who himself is reveling at the chance to connect and share something that meant something to him. I think he was also surprised that anyone even would care about that anymore.

This is a film that makes you thankful, and gave me a whole new angle on just the plight of people and how it literally is a lottery as far as who ends up where and how. No one knows what will happen the next day, and it can be anything. While it yanks at your heartstrings, it also reminds you that these are truly good people at heart(hardened now but not without emotions or life...), and all good people deserve to be treated right and kind. It is hard to put into writing how I feel about this film because it honestly affected me heavily. Coming from a background of some similar hardships and addictions awhile back(though not as brutal conditions as these folks had it...but close enough for me...), I found this film authentic and fascinating. You not only have 2 of the greatest actors alive playing the 2 main characters, but the talent across the board is simply flawless. I consider myself extremely lucky to have connected with this.",1481587200,,7205,4.421250941974378

1344391,5,B00004RZ01,"William Kennedy won The Pulitzer Prize for ""Ironweed"" then adapted this screenplay. Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep are homeless residents of Albany in 1936. Part of an ensemble cast, they take us into their past through memory and hallucination while we're shown the underbelly of part of American history.
  Nicholson is the focus of the story and we watch him confront his future by confronting his past. Helen (Streep) offers one view: ""I believe you die when you can't stand it anymore. take as much as you can then...you die. When you can."" Francis (Nicholson) rarely, if at all, expresses an opinion that scratches the surface. He simply keeps moving forward while supporting Helen who is sick with something that is dark and ugly. And as he protects her and very clearly loves her he is continuously distracted by the ghosts of several dead from his past.
  Kennedy's screenplay hides nothing from us. The life of the homeless is no different to 1936 than in 2016. The difference is that there isn't a film that shows the homeless today in honesty the way Kennedy shows the truth of Albany New York during the depression.
  Well Nicholson is fighting for his future through his past, Streep is fighting for the hours with her present. From the beginning of the film we can see that Francis has a chance and that Helen  won't make it into the third real. Yet Helen is far less burdened than Francis is. And perhaps that is the thing that sets her free. Francis still has work to do. And we learned of his burden almost immediately into the film.
  This is an artistic masterpiece. The costuming is flawless, filthy, appropriate. The parts of the film that take place during the day are void of bright colors. This sky has that winter gray to it and the only costumes that are clean and nicely pressed are the ivories suits worn by Francis' ghosts. The camerawork is very subtle and masterful. At no time or we distracted but it was swirling or jerky camera yet the camera leads us over to see things the way I am I might follow the campus of an expert painting.
  John Morris wrote the music for this film. And at times you don't hear music at all it is simply part of the entire picture. But when the music soars to punctuate an emotional point it takes your heart with it.
  ""Ironweed"" is a masterpiece. It was not big at the box office despite Nicholson and Streep. End it is also not one of those ""art"" films that attract an audience of people who prefer live theater. This is a film about truth. It was true in 1936; it was true in the early 80s with Kennedys Pulitzer Prize winning novel; it was true when the film was made; it is true today.
  This is a film worth seeing more than once.",1451433600,,2701,4.483673469387755

1344415,5,B00004RZ01,"I saw this film when it first came out and didn't really appreciate it.  Recently I revisited it (thanks to Amazon Prime) and was amazed.  The acting is stellar:  Jack Nicholson, Meryl Streep, Tom Waits, to name a few, and it seemed as if the director, Hector Babenco, simply set  his characters loose and let the grimy, grinding atmosphere (both internal and external) wear them down.  Nothing flashy - no lightning bolts (full disclosure: there is a small 'miracle' in the last 15 or so minutes)  Trajectories suggest the possibility of redemption, of reconnection,  but there are no high, ultra-dramatic moments, because no such moments exist in the lives of these characters.  They're all too human - in their courage, in their denial and in their lives and deaths.  Not an easy ride, but very much worth it, imo.",1440028800,,817,4.820143884892087

This is due largely to the brilliant performances of Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep. Nicholson gives a heartbreaking performance that ranks among his greatest. And Meryl once again exhibits her genius for creating complex and original characters that bear very little resemblance to anything she has done before. A highlight of the film comes when Streep sings the song ""He's Me Pal"". It is a master class in the art of performing a song as a character and not as a star. Someday a retrospective documentary of Streep's brilliant career will surely be made and this sequence must be included. There are also wonderful supporting performances from Carroll Baker, Tom Waits, Michael O'Keefe, Fred Gwynne, Diane Venora, Joe Grifasi and Nathan Lane.

1344446,4,B00004RZ01,"I'm glad that I saw the review which explained the real story of the 4:3 aspect ratio.
That was an obstacle for me.  I compared a scene from the disc with the You Tube version
and verified that, yes, there is actually more screen area visible on the disc.

But it is a little complicated.  There is definitely considerably more top and bottom,
but for some reason there is slightly less in horizontal dimension. But overall, more
screen area.

For some reason I feel a little proud that I saw Ironweed in its initial theatrical release
and contributed to the meager $7M domestic box.

The print is a pleasant surprise.  No visible scratches, smudges, end reel crumple, or signs
of hand work.  It looks like a typical transfer of a recent movie, which is actually quite a
compliment.

Box Office Mojo says the movie length is 2:24; the DVD case says ""approx."" 2:23.  I assume
the difference is a slight cut, but I'm not Type A enough to worry about it.

While Olive's newer release isn't perfect, it's miles ahead of the earlier studio DVD, and quite decent.

As for the film, given the weak professional reviews at the time of the film's release, I was shocked at how moving and poetic this portrait of street bums in the 30s was.  Streep and Nicholson are both magnificent, but the whole supporting cast is very good.

It has flaws - it's a little overlong, there the occasional heavy handed moment. But it's also a deeply moving portrait of lost souls trying to find meaning in a very cold world.

Heavy, even a downer, but so is a lot of terrific drama (Eugene O'Neill anyone?), so this is well worth seeking out.",1312761600,,857,4.532467532467533
1344448,3,B00004RZ01,"Despite strong performances by the entire cast, a pitch perfect depiction of a deteriorating city and a compelling story, there is something about `Ironweed' that just doesn't really work all that well.  One of my friends called it `awful' the other day, and I won't go that far, but the fact of the matter is that `Ironweed' misses its mark.

The film centers around a vagabond with a troubled past living during The Great Depression.  He is a drunk and is bombarded with haunted recollections of his past (most notably the death of his son).  During the course of one Halloween, Francis (this vagabond) attempts to reunite with his family and settle old accounts.  At the same time he's trying to make a little money and keep up his relationship with fellow boozing vagabond Helen.  His troubled past continually gets in the way of his clarity as he relives poor decisions that have forced him into his life of solidarity and in a way he is struggling to come to terms with and move on from those said decisions.

One of my main issues with this film is that fact that it doesn't seem to really have a complete handle on all it is trying to get across.  Despite the fact that it runs over two hours in length, it doesn't really say a whole lot in that time frame.  The exploration of Francis's past is done in flashbacks that reveal little details, but nothing truly concrete and the treatment of his familial reunion, while emotionally touching, feels out of place.  The films first twenty minutes or so (everything up until Meryl Streep starts singing) tends to drag on without really getting the audience absorbed or interested (""where is this going?"" was a question I kept asking myself) and despite the fact that we are almost immediately introduced to that weighty memory (his son's death) it isn't enough to draw me in at that particular moment.

`Ironweed' just feels only halfway thought out.

Despite feeling that more time was needed to truly `develop' this prose (well, not more time just time better used), all actors involved do an outstanding job in making this film feel authentic and believable.  Jack Nicholson is one of my favorite actors and truly one of the best actors who's ever lived, and he pulls out all the stops here while maintaining a sense of restraint which isn't always associated with him as an actor.  Tom Waits is also VERY convincing (who would have thought) as Francis's friend Rudy.  I really loved what Carroll Baker was able to accomplish with just a few short scenes (an essential character arc that surpassed the `Lifetime'ish handling of the scenes) but in the end it is Meryl Streep who really stole my every attention.  From her total deglam to her accent and complete physical transformation (down to the way she carried her body), Streep was utterly superb.

She nailed it.

In the end I can't say that `Ironweed' is a great film, but it is a very good `idea' with some striking performances that make it a film worth seeing at least once.",1312156800,,2989,4.67175572519084
1344449,5,B00004RZ01,"In an interview about the time this movie was released, director Hector Babenco (who is Brazilian) was quoted as saying that IRONWEED was the first book he'd read in English from cover to cover. It's very apparent from the first frame all the way through that he is in total sync with the characters and the story they're in. And, no question, this is a GRIM movie: even the few joyful moments in it are undercut by the overall joylessness of Francis Phalen's life in Depression-era Albany, New York.

Francis' personal demons haunt him in the form of phantoms from the past that pop up whenever they please; his sometime lover and partner-in-misery Helen deals with her own hauntings, and between the two of them is a bond that they hate and love all at once. Then there's Rudy, Francis' fellow bum who knows he's facing the end from terminal cancer but maintains a cheerful aspect all the same. It gives away nothing to say that the road each of them takes through their lives leads nowhere, but they live their lives knowing full well that they result from choices they made of their own free will. It's a stretch to say that you leave the movie (or the original book) with a sense of hope, but I for one left this story with a deep respect for all of the characters within.

It's a shame it didn't do better at the box office, because this movie showcases two of the finest performances given by Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep, as Francis and Helen. These are both actors who, in the past, sometimes overwhelm the movies they're in by their own personal mannerisms that never let you forget it's THEM as the characters they portray, not the characters themselves. In IRONWEED, that doesn't happen; Nicholson particularly gives such dimension to Francis that you are totally with him AS Francis from start to finish, and Streep does the same as Helen. Strong supporting performances by Fred Gwynn, Carroll Baker and Tom Waits (as Rudy) give IRONWEED emotional heft.

This is not a movie to see if you want a hopeful, positive wrap-up at the end, but it is one to see for skillful storytelling on every level.",1302480000,,2112,4.611702127659575
1344450,5,B00004RZ01,"I'd seen this film many years ago, and was impressed with a lot, especially the acting. After 20+ years, I thought I was watching a different film. It's amazing what the years can do to one's perspective. ""Ironweed"", Hector Babenco's first American film, based on William Kennedy's Pulitzer-winning novel, is certainly in the right hands; Babenco has a profound insight into the human condition, as it may apply. Slow and precise, the period of '38 Albany is perfectly presented. Mood and delivery is deliberate, and never fails to hit a nerve. Streep is first-rate, but it's Nicholson's film, a complete portrayal of a complex but incomplete man. His enigmatic character is a multi-layered  schitzo with demons at every turn. Watching this film again, without interruptions or distractions, is essential to its powerful effect. Acting from all is flawless, most notably from Jack and Meryl, but also from a very fine Tom Waits. It was good to see Carroll Baker again, too, in a tough role, handled with clarity and dignity.  Babenco, interpreting Kennedy's own script, hit a nerve that still resonates with me, days after seeing it again. Also, a fine score. I recommend all who've seen it before to give it another viewing. Make sure there are no distractions. There's real beauty in its bleak simplicity. Homeless people haven't changed that much, even after all these years. Timeless, indeed... My only complaint is that the DVD is in full screen (1.33:1) though the closing credits say that Panavision lenses were used; some of that exquisite period detail was lost.

Of course, Waites has made a career of being a grungy, depression-era street guy. Nicholson and Streep are utterly convincing as middle-class people brought low by misfortune, in the toughest time ever to be on the bum in this country. I was wary about purchasing a film I hadn't seen in 20 years, but 10 minutes in I knew I'd been right in trusting my instincts and forking out the dough. This one's a keeper -- until, that is, the owners have the good manners to provide it in proper wide-screen format, and a decent quality print. What they've given us is despicable.

The performances are first rate.  Nicholson is wonderful in a complex, difficult role of a man who is trying desperately to come to terms with crimes of his past.  Streep is heart wrenching in another difficult role which would have been easy to overplay.  Both are alcholic ""bums"" but they never descend into types; each one shines with his/her own individuality.  Tom Waits is another heartbreaker---he is so goofy and yet tender that his performance is practically the best thing in the film.

The story is grim, for sure, but the bright spots are the genuine feelings that the main characters had for each other in spite of a lot of challenges.

This isn't a feel good movie in an obvious way but there is some completion in the character of Phelan (Nicholson) as he stares down his accusing ghosts.  He seems to make peace with himself at the end, but we're not sure.",1281052800,,1089,4.684210526315789

This is a story of street people who go from day to day, even from hour to hour, trying to survive in a hopeless situation, and yet they are able to maintain a certain sense of pride, which I think comes from their friendship and support of each other.

1344458,4,B00004RZ01,"The paragraphs below were used to review the book that this film is based on. Since the film very closely follows the story line of the book the comments there can, for the most part, stand here. I would only add that Jack Nicholson's role as ex- baseball player, hard guy, and hobo alkie Fran is probably more understated that the book character (and more understated for him, given some of his more in-your-face roles). Meryl Streep, well is Merlyn Streep, and plays the role of Helen, Fran's street companion/lover, to a tee (although she might be a tad bit more beautiful that your average woman rummy). The surprise treat is the secondary role played by raspy singer-songwriter Tom Waits as Fran's sidekick, Rudy. On reflection though, for those, like me, who know Waits' later musical, work his role should not be surprised. Who else lately could fill that kind of `lost soul' hobo role so naturally?

William Kennedy is, at least in his Albany stories, my kind of writer. He writes about the trials and tribulations of the Irish diaspora as it penetrated the rough and tumble of American urban WASP-run society, for good or evil. I know those people, their follies and follibles,  like the back of my hand. Check. Kennedy writes, as here, about that pervasive hold that Catholicism has even on its most debased sons and daughters, saint and sinner alike. I know those characteristics all too well. Check. He writes about that place in class society where the working class meets the lumpen-proletariat-the thieves, grifters, drifters and conmen- the human dust. I know that place well, much better than I would ever let on. Check. He writes about the sorrows and dangers of the effects alcohol on working class families. I know that place too. Check. And so on. Oh, did I mention that he also, at some point, was an editor of some sort associated with the late Hunter S. Thompson down in Puerto Rico. I know that mad man's work well. Check

The above, in a tangential way, gets you pretty much all you need to know about the why of reading this book (and other stories by Kennedy), except a little something about the plot line. Well, that is fairly simple.  Old time baseball star Fran and his erstwhile companion, a gifted singer, Helen are drunks working their way through the edges between skid row and respectability. And, mainly, losing to the lure of the bottle and to the hard, hard struggle that it takes just to get through the day when your options are limited. Put that task together with trying to survive in the jungles, with its endless twisted characters, of Great Depression (that other one in the 1930s) Albany, trying to figure out when life went wrong and trying to figure out why it all went wrong- while fighting a losing battle against society's expectations- and one's family's. This will provide enough dramatic tension to keep you interested.  Oh did I mention that Kennedy writes with verve, with an uncanny understanding of his characters (although only Fran and Helen get the full treatment here)  and with no holds barred, or punches pulled down there on cheap street. See, that is why Kennedy and Thompson connected in the literary world.  They KNOW the under side of life. Read this thing, please.",1259193600,,3236,4.757575757575758

1344464,5,B00004RZ01,"Ironweed is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by William Kennedy (who also wrote the script) and has long been out-of-print, only recently debuting on DVD.

Besides Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep receiving Oscar nominations for their performances in 1987, Ironweed has never been talked about much. It doesn't make any ""Great Movies"" lists, it's not discussed in film circles, and it's seemingly just been forgotten. This is a tragedy, because Ironweed deserves to be considered a classic.

The film opens in Albany, New York in 1938, with Francis Phelan (Nicholson) asleep on a street. Francis is a bum. He hasn't shaved or showered in a while, he sleeps wherever he has to with no permanent address, and he's constantly drunk. Francis takes odd jobs when he runs out of money, sometimes with fellow bum Rudy (Tom Waits) who has six months to live (""Doctor says I got cancer. First thing I ever got.""). While shoveling graves, Francis stops at the gravesite of his baby son Gerald for the first time. Gerald died when Francis dropped him. Unable to take the guilt, Francis left his wife and two other children...He's been gone 22 years. While at a soup kitchen, Francis runs into his lover Helen (Streep), also a drunk, once a singer. Frank Whaley co-stars as younger Francis.

The look of the film is perfect. It does look like Depression-era New York from the costumes, to the art direction, to the cinematography. There are some subtle touches in keeping the film within its timeframe as well, such as when Helen enters a diner and on the radio there is a discussion about Orson Welles' famed ""War of the Worlds"" broadcast.

It's very well-made, but the thing that really captured my attention was the acting...Actors tend to overact when playing drunks; Nicholson and Streep are flawless. Their performances are very subtle, low-key, and powerful. Nicholson has played some of the most beloved characters to ever grace the screen...His performance as Francis is no exception. Nicholson really taps into the psyche of his character here and, in doing so, gives one of his best performances. Streep is an actress who can seemingly play anything. Here, she is terrific. The scene where Helen sings to Francis (and the patrons) in the bar is a perfect example of how completely this woman can inhabit a role. At first I was wondering what place this scene had in the film. When the scene ends, it's rather heartbreaking.

Tom Waits gives a very good performance, although I'm not sure how out of his element he is here.

Besides the depth these three actors give to their characters, one of the greatest achievements in these performances are the way the actors make you fall in love with their characters.

Ironweed is really a wonderful film, worthy of much more credit and praise than it ever received. It plays on your emotions the way few films can and it features two of the greatest living actors giving two of their greatest performances.

A forgotten classic in every sense of the word, I doubt you'll forget it once you see it.

But I reluctantly bought the substandard DVD for the chance to see Jack Nicholson and Streep in their Oscar-nominated performances.

I'm glad I did, but this is an unrelentingly bleak and slow 2 1/2-hour film--and I generally like depressing movies!  Streep and Nicholson are great, as is the art direction and cinematography--another reason it deserved a wide-screen release.

But it's possible that Ironweed the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel was unfilmable. I got the book after watching the movie, and there's a scene from early in the movie when Francis Phelan (Jack Nicholson) visits the grave of the baby son whom he accidentally dropped and killed, which led him to abandon his family.  It's worth getting the book to read this passage alone, where Kennedy expresses the ""voice"" and aura this dead baby exudes over the cemetery.  It's amazing writing that can't really be translated visually, and I expect that's what's really wrong with the movie.  In the movie, Jack Nicholson kneels before a tombstone and talks, and the haunting effect of the baby can't really be conveyed.

Francis is defined by his guilt and is haunted throughout the novel/movie by many ghosts,which are conveyed as interior monologues in the novel, and director Babenco takes the stereotypical movie approach and shows them as real hallucinations in white clothing and pale make-up. It really doesn't work.

Little actually happens in the movie, and some crucial plot elements are treated almost as throw-away lines.  Francis, who has returned after 22 years, learns that his wife never told anyone that he dropped their baby.  That knowledge is powerful and could be transformative, but we don't witness Francis receiving the knowledge; he merely reports that someone told him.

It turns out that one of the most powerful scenes in the movie is, indeed, the one of Helen (Meryl Streep), belting out ""He's Me Pal"" in a bar where her memory, fantasy and reality are intermingled with devastating results.  In that one scene, you learn who Helen was--and in her own mind remains--and who she has become.  This is another one of those chameleon performances by Streep, accent and all.  She actually has little material to work with, but she spins straw into gold and creates another one of those complicated women she has become known for. This is also where many of us first learned that she can sing.

There is also another poignant scene where Streep goes to a music store and sits down to play a piano... beautifully. The scene is enriched when we see later that she was there to steal an LP, which she got to play on the portable victrola she had just gotten out of hock. Was she consciously preparing for her death?

Aside from wonderful performances by Nicholson, Streep and Carol Baker as the abandoned wife, there is lots of over-the-top ""drunken bum"" acting by others. I can see why the film got its Oscar nominations, but I can also see why audiences stayed away in droves when it was released theatrically.",1235260800,,3342,4.843585237258348

Have to edit my review to ask what the heck is Amazon doing?

A week ago, this product garnered a low rating because 9 reviewers panned Lionsgate's ""pan and scan"" presentation of this awesome film.

Today, the rating is strangely high with over 25 reviews in the mix.

I checked and found that over half these reviews were written in 2008 and earlier when reviewers were praising the film itself while bemoaning the fact that a DVD wasn't available.

Now that a DVD has been released, Amazon is suddenly including these ""old"" reviews to artificially inflate the rating on this terribly disappointing presentation.

Wow!",1235088000,,1044,4.792134831460674
1344473,5,B00004RZ01,There certainly MUST be a mistake in the product details on this film...at least I hope so. This is one of the greta movies of all times with arguably the finest actors of their generation at the top of their respective form. I can only hope that Lionsgate will be releasing a widescreen version and not a scanned version. Part of the film's power resides in the director's vision.,1235088000,,381,4.536231884057971

1344475,5,B00004RZ01,"This is a great film.  Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson were given a great story (by William Kennedy), and they responded with greatness.  I've been waiting for it to come out in DVD, largely because my VHS copy is a pan-and-scan, fullscreen (1.33:1) version, and this film deserves to be seen in its glorious widescreen (1.85:1) theatrical version.  Unfortunately, the ""product details"" indicate that this DVD is ""fullscreen"", and it has been confirmed (2-24-09) by two people (Neil and Brad) that it is the fullscreen version.  [Brad even commented that it looked like a copy of the old VHS pan-and-scan tape].

August '09 EDIT:  Butch Johnson, a projectionist, gave the film a 3 star rating (on Feb. 27, 2009); he commented that this film was originally filmed in a fullscreen (1.33 : 1) aspect ratio, and ""cropped"" on the top and bottom for commercial ""widescreen"" theatrical distribution.  Comparing this fullscreen version with the widescreen version (which can be seen on youtube in installments, numbered: 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) Mr. Johnson's claim appears quite valid.  Consequently, although there's certainly something to be said for a film that fills our widescreen television screens, this DVD does not appear to be a pan-and-scan; it actually lets us see more of the ""original"" film, in--paradoxically--a smaller ""blackboxed"" 4X3 area.

UPDATE APRIL 2013:  Hosanna! The Bluray widescreen (1:77:1) version of this film is vastly superior to the previously released fullscreen version.  As mentioned in my two previous paragraphs, the top and the bottom of this newer version have been trimmed, but the film is now available the way the director intended, and it packs a much stronger wallop.  The video quality of the bluray version is greatly improved, and it makes for a considerably richer movie experience.  Enjoy!",1234137600,,1825,5.166666666666667
1344476,5,B00004RZ01,"I have to agree with the five star rating for this movie as well.  It has taking much too long for it to be released on DVD.  This is a classic, very well made and with superb acting by both Jack & Meryl, but then again - - - can you ever go wrong with each of these actors???

I especially love the simplicity of the cinematography, as it transformed me (the audience) in to the depression era.  It was one of those movies that you could sit and watch forever.  I can't wait to receive my copy on DVD.

Thank you Jack and Meryl for your outstanding performances!

Keep them coming!

1344477,5,B00004RZ01,"It's amazing that it took so long for this film to come out on DVD. I can only figure that there were some legal problems preventing it's release.

Based on the Bestselling novel by William Kennedy, it tells the story of hobo Francis Phelan upon his return to his hometown of Albany, NY during the Great Depression. (No, you'll find no spoilers here!)

Excellent work by Jack Nicholson in the lead role (though some have complained that he looks too hefty to be a bum during the depression); an overlooked Oscar-worthy performance by Meryl Streep; and a poignant bit of acting by Tom Waits as a fellow bum. Great casting in the secondary roles as well including Fred Gwynne, Carroll Baker, Michael O'Keefe and many others. Look for a cameo of William Kennedy during Meryl Streep's singing of ""He's Me Pal""

Authentically filmed on location in Albany during the chill of Autumn, Hector Babenco has done a wonderful job capturing the latter years of the Depression and transforming a great novel into a great film.

ON THE DVD:
While I stick by my 5 star review of the film. I can only give the DVD 1 star. I received my copy yesterday and found that it is not the aspect ratio of the theatrical release. (Thanks to all who brought this to my attention). I had hoped for remastered sound and picture and was disappointed to find it is no more than the VHS version tranferred to DVD. Lionsgate really screwed up. However it will have to serve until someone else makes a proper release of this great flick.

Blu-Ray update 4-16-2013

This is a no frills Blu-Ray disc; it contains no special features, commentaries or language selection. It is however in widescreen format, and though the picture quality is not up to par with many more famous older films that have been put into Hi-Res, it is still miles ahead of the horrid DVD transfer that Lionsgate put out awhile back. Also,the DTS soundtrack is MUCH better than previous versions.
Given the relatively small following this film has, it is unlikely we'll see a better treatment than this in the near future. If you're looking for the best video of ""Ironweed"" available, this Blu-Ray is the one to buy.",1229558400,,2152,4.65

1344479,5,B00004RZ01,"Like a cinematic Hopper painting, this film stays with you even when you are not looking at it.  It is a perfect example of how American film can have substance and not insult you by giving you all the information and all the answers.

The film tells the story of a short period of time in the life of a ""bum"", played by Jack Nicholson.  He has been adrift ever since two decades earlier he accidently killed his 13 day old son.  He seems to go from place to place on the rails, with no other goals than making a buck here and there and finding a drink.  He has no constant companions, only other bums he sees from time to time.  The closest he has to a best friend is Meryl Streep's character.  Aside from her alcoholism, she also seems to be mentally troubled.  She has her own past to deal with, as it seems she came from a well-off family and was a noted singer at one time.

The film finds Nicholson's character returning to his home town of Albany, NY, and confronting some of his past.  Aside from his son, he has also been responsible for the deaths of at least two other people, one by accident, and one in self defense.  Their ghosts, as well as others he feels he has wronged, haunt him regularly.  Eventually he returns to his family for a visit, but I would leave it up to the viewer to decide what he comes away with.

The acting is superb, as are the depictions of the life of these people and the people they come in contact with.  Tom Waits is so good in his role, he had to be born to play it.  I defy anyone with a soul to not be moved incredibly by the scene in which Streep sings in a saloon for a kindly washed up singer played by Fred Gwynne.  It doesn't happen often, but I turned the TV off after the scene and sat in the dark for a while.  Find a scene like that in a recent film, if you can.

It is a deliberately paced film, and there is no traditional plot, but that works to it's advantage.  Well worth the time and the effort it will take to leave an indelible impression on the viewer.",1213920000,,2017,4.099489795918367

1344482,2,B00004RZ01,"....Could Hardly Wait For The Credits.  I don't usually write movie reviews, but people gotta be warned here.  I saw this ages ago, and it left just a vague impression.  Decided to order it and view again, as Nicholson is one of my favorites.  I could not sympathize with any of the characters in this movie.  The actors and actresses never seemed to drop into their roles at all.  The sets and backdrops were just too phony and ordinary, and the themes and places portrayed should have come across much more raw and gritty.  The acting was sub-par and the dialogue was contrived and predictable.  Nicholson couldn't even save this flick for me.  Streep acted like a paper sack in this one.  The recurring ghosts were just annoying and the family reunion scene made me ache is was so lousy.  If you wanna see a real drama about destitute and homeless people, get Barfly.  If you wanna see Nicholson is an unforgettable role, get The Last Detail, One Flew Over..., or even Goin' South.  Streep shined much brighter in Silkwood and Sophie's Choice.  This one was a mess.  Sorry-don't blow your $$$ on Ironweed.  Two stars are for some effective flashback sequenses and Streep singing in the bar (only scene in movie that moved me at all).  Notice when Nicholson, as a youth, hits the guy with whatever he threw during the strike.  The projectile never came close to hitting the guy, and the man who (supposedly) got struck covered his face and fell backwards before anything even got near him.

Fast foward to about ten years later and I discovered William Kennedys ""Albany Trio"" at the library. When I finally got to the last of the trio tales I read ""Ironweed"" in one day and then went out and rented the vhs version at my local video store. Jack Nicholson does an outstanding job in his role as ""Francis Phelan"" a man haunted by the ghosts from his past.

Tom Waits as ""Rudy the kraut"" was my favorite character. Meryl Streep is outstanding as usual in her role as Francis Phelans girlfriend. Yes it is sad, depressing and not for all tastes (especially mainstream moviegoers) but, the performances by all are heartfelt. One of the few movies brought to the screen from a great story by William Kennedy who also wrote the screenplay.

Great soundtrack by John Morris and Hector Babenco directed this wonderful adaption. Now with all the garbage DVD's on sale I can not understand why this movie is not available on DVD.

Nothing much happens in the movie; it's mostly atmosphere: skid row, old memories, etc. At 144 minutes it's way too long--we lose interest in the characters, even though their acting is superb.

1344491,4,B00004RZ01,"In highschool I came across a poem called The Projectionist's Nightmare, I don't recall the name of the poet but the poem's message is still very much with me. It described a wayward bird inside a movie theatre, where an  audience was watching two poeple ""being nice to each other"". The  bird crashes into the screen, its blood slithering onto the image, the  spell is broken, the fantasy dispelled and the audience screams. Hector  Babenco had already made this poem in substance in 1985s Kiss Of A Spider  Woman where his lead character, a prisoner, escaped his miserable  surroundings through memories and fantasies of a propaganda film. Two years  later Bebanco would make Ironweed, and his lead character Frances Phelan  (Jack Nicholson) is well past the dreaming stage, the only fantasies he has  are of ghosts from his past.
  Ironweed is a film many people would find  slow. Nothing much happens and the characters don't change. The stark grim  atmosphere and the dead end conditions unrelenting. There is no hope in the  story of Frances Phelan. He has abandoned his family 22 years ago after  dropping his 13 year old baby to its death. The film starts with him  visiting his dead baby's grave for the first time, and then follows him  around as he joins his companion Helen Archer (Meryl Streep) and his friend  of sorts Rudy (Tom Waits). All three of them are alcoholics, and we watch  as they wade through the alleys of Albany 1938 looking for a place to sleep  . They get robbed, they see a homeless prostitute from Alaska die of cold  and they get into fights. But there is no emotional release in their anger  or in their better moments. You'd expect there to be emancipated joy when  Streep sings in a bar in front of a full house, or rage when a bunch of  kids rob them of all their money. But Streep is quickly back to her  depression, and Nicholson shrugs off the robbery. All the characters in  Ironweed are infact dead, they live off their memories, do what they have  to do to stay alive as they await their physical death. Meanwhile there are  quietly affecting scenes of closure as Nicholson visits his abandoned  family and Streep remember her ""musical days"". Nicholson's and  Streep's Oscar nominated performance are among their best.
  Babenco  holds his camera on his characters for a long time, as if waiting for them  to crack. They never do because Ironweed is not angry, it doesn't have an  agenda, it is just mournful. As I watched it for the first time tonight I  became aware that the episodic cyclic nature of the film develops in the  end to a complete whole. When the end credits roll you feel like you were  standing too close to a painting, and now for the first time you are far  enough to see it for the sad beautiful image it is. The famed author John  Fowles said that we are all poets but few of us can write it. From the  rhetorical dialogue of these hobos, the ugly poverty they endure, the dark  allyways they inhabit and the ghosts that haunt them, Ironweed emerges as a  sad and deeply affecting poem.",964656000,,3052,4.574074074074074

Perhaps because many people had actual family or friends who became homeless during the depression or experienced a father deserting the family because he could not longer feed them, they had more empathy than now.
