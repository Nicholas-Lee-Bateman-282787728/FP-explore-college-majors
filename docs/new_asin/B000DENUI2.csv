8102361,4,B000DENUI2,"The video is a bit dated, and sometimes you wish you could ask questions, but this is a very good and seemingly honest documentary about building an earthbag home.  I know I picked up quite a few pointers and hope to not repeat some of the mistakes Kelly made.",1407369600,2,260,4.3061224489795915
8102362,5,B000DENUI2,I have bought many books to prepare for building. This book is very informative and will be used in conjunction with others. Wish me luck and strength!,1396310400,2,151,4.62962962962963
8102363,5,B000DENUI2,We really enjoyed this video and learned much about how to build an earthbag home - something we plan to do next summer - and some things not to do.  We really appreciated Kelly's honesty and the chance to learn from his mistakes.  The house still stands strong a decade later and is absolutely charming!,1345248000,6,304,4.509090909090909
8102364,5,B000DENUI2,"Having house sat in the Hart house for 2 weeks in the middle of a Colorado winter, my wife and I can attest to how well the house functions.  The key word is in the title, ""Experimental"".  Kelly's honest approach to sharing his story takes the viewer on a journey through the thought process and application of a brilliant idea. His successes and failures are real life and in the end shows that dedication to environmentally sound ideas are worth the efforts.  I highly recommend this DVD program to any owner/builder embarking on the major journey of building a home even if the home is not earthbag.  In the end the experimental home is a series of trials and errors which the Harts saw to its successful completion in a way that made me smile and admire.  Their homes' integrity is way beyond the demands of any building department anywhere!

Finally, we were so inspired by his concepts that we designed and built our home with earthbags as well.",1174003200,17,951,4.597633136094674
8102365,5,B000DENUI2,"Producers Kelly and Rosana Hart have come up with another winner. They've already given us the definitive video on alternative architecture, ""A Sampler of Alternative Homes,"" but this is their personal story. From a base of sand, cactus and brush in Colorado's San Luis Valley arose a beautiful home made almost exclusively out of crushed rock and old copies of the local newspaper. There were mishaps along the way, true, but Rome wasn't built in a day, so there's no need to impose stricter standards on earthbag houses. As the cost of conventional construction materials and the levels of carbon in the atmosphere continue their disturbing rise, this visionary DVD points to a future where buildings (one of the largest contributors to global warming) don't hurt the very Earth they stand on and the new worth of those who just want a little shelter.",1173916800,10,853,4.930555555555555
8102366,1,B000DENUI2,"How come there is not a ""no-star"" option? The house they built looks dangerous, in fact, they had some collapses while building. This is simply not a good example of earthbag building. There are so many good sources available for information, for example, Kaki Hunter and Doni Kiffmeyer's wonderully written and informative book, Earthbag Building: The Tools, Tricks and Techniques (Natural Building Series), and anythiung from CALEARTH/Nader Khalili, that this movie serves no purpose other than to show how not to build with earth bags.

Earthbag Building, an excellent book, shows a very concise, step by step way to build that is solid and safe, and is a fantastic resource..

My advice would be to save your  money, and buy the movies by Mr. Khalili, or buy Kaki and Donis book. Getting a movie to watch the fumbling steps leading to an unsafe and esthetically challenged building is a waste of money.",1173830400,10,906,4.947368421052632
