2925968,1,B000SJQQPQ,"I wish I would have seen the other reviews before I bought this!  I bought this for my grandchildren to see more of Scrat's antics since the title said it was Chillin' with Scrat, I thought that's what it would be, what a let down when it was not what I thought it would be.",1347926400,6,274,3.981818181818182
2925969,1,B000SJQQPQ,"I bought this DVD specifically for a Scrat-short movie, as the title would indicate. However, there is NO MOVIE on here AT ALL.  It is simply some games and a background of making a movie.  What a complete waste!!!",1293753600,12,214,4.461538461538462
2925970,2,B000SJQQPQ,"There is very little content of interest to even a die-hard Scrat fan like me.  Maybe the kids will play one of the silly dvd remote games, but this was a total yawner.",1292803200,8,168,4.090909090909091

8215360,1,B000SJQQPQ,I thought this was the actually DVD with the scrat scenes but its just the game version which is pointless. Maybe I read the description wrong but I'm usually a very thorough reader when making a purchase online.,1440892800,2,212,4.605263157894737

8215363,1,B000SJQQPQ,"I thought Ice Age: Chillin' with Scrat would have some funny episodes with Scrat on it, instead it was just how they made the movie. There are some games on it you can play on your computer. All in all a very disappointing purchase.",1423180800,2,232,4.295454545454546
8215364,1,B000SJQQPQ,Should have read others wasn't what I expected,1418428800,,46,4.875
8215365,1,B000SJQQPQ,Thought it was an animated cartoon. It was a documentary on how the film was made. We were disappointed. What can we do?,1417046400,,120,4.260869565217392
8215366,1,B000SJQQPQ,"This is promoted as a dvd/movie. Warning, it is not! It is simply some commentary and a couple games for your PC. I ordered this because my 2 yar old loves Scrat. We were all disappointed when we found this has nothing to do with a Scrat movie.",1407715200,2,244,4.104166666666667
8215367,2,B000SJQQPQ,"This was NOT what I expected, so I didn't care for it. I wouldn't recommend it, but someone else may like it though.",1393977600,,116,4.086956521739131
8215368,1,B000SJQQPQ,"It's terrible. No movie or short, the interactive game or whatever it is supposed to be is terrible, a complete waste of money

This DVD is a mis-representation of what it really is.  Don't waste your money.",1385337600,4,207,4.5675675675675675
