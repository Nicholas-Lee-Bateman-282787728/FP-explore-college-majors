8033377,5,B0002VR9U6,"I first saw this HBO Documentary my freshman year in college.  As a recent high school graduate,  my only regret was that my father never let me play football.  He lettered in football all 4 years in high school and played all 4 years in college.  Yet, I was not allowed to play.  How is that fair?  After watching this show, I understood.

Before my father was 40 years old,  he had 2 bad knees, a bad hip and a bad back.  He could never stand for very long and could not run more than a few feet.  He lived in consaint pain.  All caused by 10 plus years of tackle football.  He saved me from that.  Unlike the subjects in this film, my dad regretted playing football.

At 48 years old, I can chase after my 11 year old son.  I can go bike riding with him.  I can run up and down the baseline photographing him during his baseball games.  Things my father wished he could have done with me.

I love to watch football, but I hate the way it is taught.  Have your child watch this if they want to play the game.",1356566400,2,1010,4.035532994923858
