1881246,3,B000098ZSK,"In ""War of the Monsters: Gamera vs. Barugon"" (known as ""Daikaij kessen: Gamera tai Barugon"" in the Land of the Rising Sun) everybody's favorite jet-powered super-turtle Gamera battles Barugon, a gigantic horned dinosaur hatched from a huge opal. From his deadly horns, Barugon emits the devastating ""rainbow ray"" and he also has some wild tongue action that defies description. That means in this second edition of the Gamera series, the giant turtle gets to be the hero, so it sure was a good thing the Japanese Defense Forces decided to let him live at the end of the first film. Gamera was awakened by a nuclear explosion, but Barugon gets hatched when a bunch of stupid gangsters try to cash in on the giant opal, which, of course, is really a giant egg.
Unlike the first Gamera film, ""War of the Monsters: Gamera vs. Barugon"" is in color (which makes the special effects look cheesier) and in Japanese (which means unemployed American actors are sparred being spliced into the action, a ploy that only worked with Raymond Burr in the original ""Godzilla"" film). The first half of the film is arguably more boring than the original film, mainly because it is a monster movie with no monsters until the second half. But you do have the semblance of a fight between the two creatures in the end. Consider this one step forward and one step backwards with regards to the original Gamera film. The cast is headed by Kojiro Hongo as Keisuke Hirata, Koji Fujiyama as Onodera, and Kyko Enami as Karen.",1073952000,6,1497,4.717557251908397
1881247,3,B000098ZSK,"War of the Monsters, aka Gamera vs. Barugon, is one of the showa (60s - 80s) Gamera series' highlights.  The film is perhaps the most serious entry in the series and is the first color Gamera film.
However, the DVD from alpha video isn't quite up to task of showing this classic kaiju film in all of its brilliance.  The worst problem on the disc is the print of the film.  The film is in color, but you might not know that unless you knew it was beforehand.  The colors are so faded on the film, it could be thought that it was filmed in black and white.  Yet, this film can not be found on region 1 DVD anywhere else, and for 7 bucks, I highly recommend you pick it up, despite its faults.",1064707200,2,691,4.088888888888889
1881248,5,B000098ZSK,Gamera escapes from the rocket that was supposed to take him to Mars. Barugon and Gamera both look tight. No child cheering Gamera on through the whole movie. Gamera's scariest look of the Showa series. A great film for all ages. 10 stars out of 5,1063756800,4,247,4.391304347826087

This should be required viewing for everyone that loves stuffy movies... it should cure them!

1881250,5,B000098ZSK,"The sequel to Gamera The Invicible is about lies, trickery and greed. During WW2, someone left and ""opal"", he had discovered, hidden in a cave to be found when he came back. Years later he hires his brother and two other meant to go and get the ""opal"" They go to the island the older brother left the jewel only to be stopped by the villagers that inhabit the island. They are told that they shouldn't enter the cave because it is cursed and those that do go, they don't come back alive. Convinced that this is a myth used to scare people away from a hidden treasure, they continue anyway. Later in the cave, they find the ""opal"" and one of the three betrays the other two and leaves them for dead. Little does he know that what he has is not an opal at all, but something much worse... I originally didn't like this movie, but I watched it again and I loved it. This is definitely one of the best Showa Gamera films. This had nothing to do with children saving the day like the later movies would become. No kid in sight through the entire movie. This movie was amazing, some of the best fight scenes I have seen between Gamera and Barugon, and also some of the best fights scenes I have seen on a kaiju movie between the good and bad humans. Barugon's name is a rip off of Toho's Baragon, but the monster itself is original and amazing. This and the first movie Gamera the Invincible is definitely the two movies to watch if you're new to the Showa Gamera world.",1133913600,5,1464,4.26978417266187
1881251,3,B000098ZSK,"I rented this and was very impressed, as most people know the old Gamera movies are........in one word,horrible, this one isn't though.(NOTE:This is nothing like the chessy and horrible Gamera vs. Zigra, or Gamera vs. Guiron) This is a completly different series. Baraguon is awesome and quite a skilled fighter, this is no were near cheesy or corny to me. For a true Kaiju(giant monster)fan it is a must see.",1102896000,,409,4.857142857142857
1881252,5,B000098ZSK,"It should be noted that this is the AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL

version of this film. It features excellent dubbing and should not be confused with the horrible SANDY FRANK version that aired on

MST3K.",1101686400,6,198,4.96969696969697
1881253,5,B000098ZSK,"This film is great, it can be emotional at some points, and the fighting scenes are great. Although the picture isn't too good and it is in full screen, this doesn't take away from this film. The characters are great, the monsters are great. This is the only showa Gamera film that doesn't have a child that doesn't have a child star. Gamera looks very good in this film, with an evil look in the face, Barugon looks realistic as well. If your a fan of these films, then this is worth the time and money.",1097020800,2,504,4.260416666666667
1881254,3,B000098ZSK,"Gamera must stop destroying things and save japan from the horrid Barugon, a gigantic lizard with a mile-long tongue that shoots a frosty, fire-extinguisher-like blast. Barugon also emits a killer rainbow (??!) from out of it's back! Gamera isn't in it as much as I'd like, but the battles are cool. The first half of the movie is about the plight of a group of thieves who unwittingly release Barugon from it's ""egg"". It grows at an alarming rate, wiping out all in it's path! Can Gamera stop this grumpy reptile in time? Watch and be astonished...",1077494400,,549,4.670103092783505

7990108,5,B000098ZSK,"War of the Monsters is in the tradition of the Godzilla films.  Gamera is pictured as good in later films, but in this movie, just defeats another menace to Japan.  The true theme of the movie, is the heroes desire to right the wrong he has committed in the first place.  he sees his actions as having released this terrible creature on the world.  The rest of the film follows the heroes quest to right that wrong.  Gamera does the job for him, in the end.  Good fun, don't take it seriously, just enjoy it.  JRV",1369353600,,513,4.28125
7990109,4,B000098ZSK,"This movie,a sequel to Gamera -  War of the Monsters aka Gamera vs Barugon has a very good story to with the monster elements. Barugon has a giant tongue, a Rainbow ray from its back,etc. Gamera wasn't really a hero (yet) in this movie, he was just a monster fighting another monster for supremacy. Barugon has blue blood. He was brought to Japan by a greedy underground/gangster type. He went to an island to find a jewel. He stabs his 2 friends in the back leaving them for dead in a cave where the jewel is and returns to Japan. He thought he brought back a jewel that would make him rich,but it was an egg. The egg grows in the light on the boat that is going back to Japan causes an accident and Barugon is born. He runs into Gamera and they do their fighting, not great fighting but it was ok. The story is strong here as opposed to later Gamera movies. The DVD from Alpha, full frame, a little blurry,just your average Alpha DVD release, AIP dubbing. Celebrity Video had a Sandy Frank VHS release of this. This movie along with Gamera, and Gamera vs Gaos were the top 3 movies before the series went to pot with bad effects & made them more for kiddies..",1230249600,,1161,4.277272727272727
7990110,5,B000098ZSK,"It's been a long time since I seen this movie. Way back in the 70s.  Originally, AIP plan to show this film at drive ins, but release it directly to TV instead. The film is awesome. especelly when Barugon ate a guy trying get away with a diamond that was to lure the monster into the lake. This is the second entry in the Gamera series. I recomened this movie to all monster movie fans.",1175126400,,386,4.1466666666666665
7990111,4,B000098ZSK,"AKA GAMERA VS. BARUGON THIS IS THE FIRST GAMERA MOVIE SHOT IN COLOR, BUT IT'S REALLY BARUGON WHO IS THE STAR OF THIS ONE! GAMERA APPEARS EARLY IN TINTED FLASHBACK SCENES FROM THE ORIGINAL B&W GAMERA FILM & THEN QUICKLY RETURNS TO EARTH FROM THE COSMOS TO BLOW UP A DAM. NEXT WE GET A STORY ABOUT 3 TREASURE HUNTERS WHO THINK THIS BARUGON-EGG IS SOME GEM WORTH A FORTUNE. ONE TREASURE HUNTER DIES FROM A SCORPION BITE & THE 3RD TRIES TO KILL THE 2ND & MAKE OFF WITH THE GEM. ANYWAY, BARUGON HATCHES & GOES ON THE EXPECTED DESTRUCTIVE RAMPAGE. TREASURE HUNTER #2 & HIS ISLAND/NATIVE? GIRLFRIEND RETURN AS DOES GAMERA FOR THE FINAL MONSTER BATTLE!!! TREASURE HUNTER SCUMBAG #3 & BARUGON GET THEIRS & ALL ENDS WELL...

PLAYED STRAIGHT, NO LITTLE KIDS TO GET IN THE WAY, THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD MONSTER BASH WHICH I'VE WATCHED SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE YEARS...

HOWEVER...THE ALPHA DVD IS REALLY PRETTY BAD WITH WASHED-OUT COLOR. I COMPARED IT TO THE EXTENDED PLAY VHS I HAVE "" GAMERA VS. BARUGON "" & THE VHS WINS HANDS DOWN. IT'S PACKAGED AS CELEBRITY HOME ENTERTAINMENT(1987) UNDER THEIR "" CELEBRITY JUST FOR KIDS "" SERIES WHICH FEATURES OTHER GAMERA FILMS AS WELL. THE COLOR HERE IS SO MUCH BETTER (AFTER I'VE ADJUSTED THE TRACKING). THIS IS THE SANDY FRANK EDITION WHICH I UNDERSTAND HAS AWFUL DUBBING( SEEMED JUST FINE TO ME-I LIKED THE INANE LINES ), BUT IS THE MORE VIOLENT UNCUT VERSION. WHATEVER...

ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT MY OLD VHS WAS LIGHT YEARS BETTER THAN WHAT ALPHA HAS OUT THERE ON DVD.",1165449600,2,1493,4.501845018450185
7990112,5,B000098ZSK,"War of the Monsters is the second film that Gamera stars in.  A new monster called Barugon is released from an egg, mistaken for an opal by treasure hunters, and brings death and chaos.  Barugon seems to be a creature of cold and ice which makes it harder for Gamera to defeat.  After all the giant turtle has problems moving when it gets too cold.

The plot is a tad slow moving but at least makes more sense than most monster movies.  Gamera is not seen as good or as a Hero.  He is just seen as energy hungry creature focusing on a new source of energy - Barugon.  The extras are very interesting.  The posters used in Europe seem to say Godzilla instead of Gamera.  First film of Gamera in color.",1159833600,,700,4.242424242424242
7990113,4,B000098ZSK,"I grew up watching Gamera movies on Detroit TV. They'd have Gamera week and Godzilla week and I'd race home from public school to watch em all.

Now as Gamera went I wasn't as big a fan. The whole flying turtle thing and too many pathetic little kids in the story lines really turned me off. BUT recently I bought the 90's Gamera box set and was blown away! The 90's movies are really good (too bad they didn't make a part 4). And thus wanting more I decided to take a trip down memory lane and wander the mine field of cheesy hokey cruddy Gamera films. I started with the first one which is totally ruined by American actor scenes which just make an already stupid movie EVEN worse. I checked out Gamera vs Monster X cause it was my all time childhood fave (the sub scene). It's OK but leans towards kiddy film heavily, although the cheese factor pulls it from a complete nose dive and several clever scenes keep it above water too. Nervous about trying more I decided to read the other reviews and most people rated War of The Monsters rather highly (one I don't remember all that well) so I gave it a shot- hell, Alpha DVD's are cheap as dirt (with equal quality). And I got to say I was happily surprised. Why??

A) Solid SCI-FI adult story line! Some loopy stuff but hey it's about a flying turtle damn-it.

B) Good action scenes. Loads of monster crushing stuff and decent human action as well.

C) Plausible evil monster. Okay the rainbow ray is a bit sissy and the baseball bat tongue is really odd. But he grew up quick and mean. GOOD human villian too!

D) NO stupid little kids. I repeat NO stupid little kids.

E) Hot chick in lead role. Got to like that.

F) Good soundtrack- no kiddy music!

So why not 5 stars??

A) Not enough Gamera. When it ends you realize Gamera just wasn't in there enough to make it a 5. Good- but needed more.

B) BAD special effects- good enough for B-Movie fans. Better than ""Reptilicus"" but still goofy bad and loads of wires. Monster blood looked like chocolate milk (maybe the reason why is located in C).

C) Pathetic Alpha Video quality dub. For three seconds the colour goes perfect and you realize why you are squinting your eyes. AND for those few seconds you realize how good this movie could look if done properly. Especially the island dancer scenes! Come on Alpha Video it doesn't have to suck this BAD!!

In conclusion: Solid Monster movie. Dreadful DVD quality dub. But a keeper in my B-Movie collection. I have a feeling this movie may last longer than Monster X (oh those stupid little kids! And all that kiddy music. Gotta remember the telephone poles in the ears and the sub scene... cheese factor- cheese factor- plugging hydro wires into his heart by taking a sub into his mouth- classic cheese).",1153440000,12,2757,4.426877470355731
7990114,4,B000098ZSK,"""War of the Monsters"" is a sad print (grainy, the ends cropped so sometimes the monsters' heads barely peek into either side of the frame) of a quite good monster movie.  The human characters in this one actually inhabit a decent story of their own, and have some interaction with the monsters, rather than being mere spectators.  Our beloved Gamera and his enemy for this battle Barugon are both cleverly conceived and well realized.  There are no little kids in this one, which some will see as a blessing.",1147651200,2,508,4.685393258426966
