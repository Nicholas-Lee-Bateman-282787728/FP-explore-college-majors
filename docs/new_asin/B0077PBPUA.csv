I love this program.

It is not HD DVD, comparing to my current HD TV program Verizon Fios.",1355443200,,163,4.258064516129032

5062171,5,B0077PBPUA,"This is a great series, I highly recommend it.  The cinematography is really good.  It is easy to watch and very informative, even my 4 year old likes watching it.  It would be great for school projects or anyone interested in transport, energy, food and manufacturing. The interviews are good too.",1346803200,,298,4.803921568627451
5062172,5,B0077PBPUA,"I cannot recommend this DVD enough.  The photography is sensational.  Climbing to the top of a wind turbine - you have no idea how very high those turbines are until you see this. ALL of the photography is first-rate.  The 2 DVDs move along at a fast pace and covers 4 individual subjects.  Yul Kwon is so likable, I could watch him all day!  He is fun and enjoyable to watch but not stupid like so many things are today.  It is fascinating and enjoyable at the same time.

This DVD covers 4 areas:  Food, Energy, Transportation, and Manufacturing. My personal favorite was the Transportation.

I highly recommend this for all ages from the very young to the very old.  I hope to see Yul Kwon in many more things.  Do buy this.  You will not be disappointed.",1341619200,3,758,4.413043478260869
5062173,2,B0077PBPUA,"[There really needs to be a negative review on this page and I'm here to provide it.]

I was introduced to this TV series by a blog post that displayed some of the gorgeous infographics the series features. I was excited to see these graphics come to life. When I pressed play on the show, my expectations of getting any sort of valuable information were seriously lowered when the host proclaimed he was a winner on Survivor. When he started the show by listing corporations, I grew less enthusiastic. It was really downhill from there and I have to admit to not moving past the first episode.

I wasn't expecting an activist film essay like Food Inc., but I did want something that didn't just gloss over problems with our food system in favor of saying things like, ""see the excess food gets wasted in a way that helps fight cancer"" implying, ""aren't corporations great?"" I would argue with other reviewers here that say it wasn't a political documentary, I think it was very political but in favor of the current system. It isn't just political to criticize, it's also political to glorify corporations in an entertaining way. There were just too few facts and too much wide-eyed wonder/infotainment.

I would have enjoyed a serious analysis on why the current food system is great, addressing the arguments to the contrary, even if I ended up not agreeing. I would have also enjoyed something that was just made of cold facts and infographics about America's food infrastructure. What I got instead was propaganda with pretty photography.",1340409600,7,1543,4.815094339622641
5062174,5,B0077PBPUA,Awesome educational series. I learned so much and am ordering the dvd set as a gift for my mom now!,1335916800,,99,4.0
5062175,5,B0077PBPUA,This is a great and really well made program that I first watched through PBS. Yul does a great job at breaking down the huge topics in a really interesting fashion. It reminds me of when I was a kid and we had great educational tv shows that there really isn't enough of these days.,1334707200,6,283,4.163636363636364
5062176,5,B0077PBPUA,"I love this show.  No politics, just facts.  The viewer can see the big picture of how America works.  It creates discussion. Which is most benefical.",1334707200,5,150,4.6923076923076925
5062177,5,B0077PBPUA,"After watching the preview of this show America Revealed, I jumped on my computer immediately to order the DVD on Amazon. This show is not only visually entertaining with stunning aerial photography, it is also educational with facts and statistics about how America works. Some of the information might not be ""new"" but it has been organized and explained in a way that can help us see this country and its infrastructure. I love the fact that the producer has chosen Yul Kwon (2006 winner of the hit reality TV show Survivor), a Korean-American (who is also an eloquent speaker) to be the host of this show.

I highly recommend this show to ages of all level. It will help paint a bigger picture of how America works and what we can do to make it a better place for everyone. For more information, visit the show's website:

8511865,2,B0077PBPUA,The scenery and graphics in this are impressive for sure yet its hard to get on board with the way our food is produced on such large scales to the point that we waste a lot of it as well as export a significant percentage. The beef production was especially disturbing especially since the host was so excited about this unnatural manufacturing style. I couldn't stomach finishing this.,1512259200,,387,4.705882352941177
8511866,3,B0077PBPUA,"Four excellent productions on the world's resources.  While it is becoming dated, it is still useful for how our world works for energy and food.",1436054400,,145,4.8
8511867,5,B0077PBPUA,"This is a very educational DVD, some four hours of full facts and knowledge which reveals where you get your tomatoes to how cows are fed and become packaged beef to how energy is produced and how it gets everything transported in US. This documentary is about systems and networks that move us, feed us and make our economy hum and how we put together the materials and manpower that keeps the incredibly vast and complex America with over three hundred million people working, day after day.

A century ago a third of us worked and lived on farms, now it is barely two percent. For the first time in human history, just 2% of the population can feed the other 98%. Human element is becoming less and less of factor but other parts of the equation have not and infact are becoming more of a real serious issues than ever before from water to environment. Looking at the societal value of producing food only by gallons of water used may be silly, if not absurd but it is becoming a reality in deserts of CA when CA is using 80% of their water for agriculture in a state with no water. Growers calculate that it takes about 168 gallons of water to produce a single watermelon, 50 gallons for a cantaloupe, 10 gallons for a single almond, 35 gallons for a head of broccoli, roughly 40 gallons for a single ear of corn and only 1 gallons of water for a single almond. Almond trees hold water in the roots and trunks, clean the air so killing that industry in CA may have a negative impact regardless but the issue in 21st century America, it is not just about producing more calories anymore but how can we feed us healthy calories with sustainable environment, where our food machine gives us more food than most of us will ever need, over some 600 calories a day for each of us which is reflected in the high obesity levels unseen like ever before.

The reporter speaks nicely and professionally and although present on many shots in the documentary, you will hardly even notice his presents except the facts that he presents. You can watch this DVD with your kids as a very informative and extremely educational DVD. The best DVD if you are stock anywhere where you just want to learn and expand your horizon for four solid hours without getting board or emotional. Food, transportation, energy and manufacturing never sounded so good on a DVD. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1429488000,,2366,4.525700934579439

8511872,5,B0077PBPUA,"The first time I tuned into this show on PBS I had no preconception re: what to expect.  Throughout that first experience I was mesmerized, which is why I have subsequently bought the series.  I want to take in the remarkable depth presented at its full, which I know will require multiple viewings.  That is no problem, as I find the material and presentation to be just as riveting each time.  A particular aspect of it all I especially appreciate is the very even-handed presentation of the material.  There is no agenda being pushed here.  This is the situation being told as it is, with the viewer free to interpret the facts and draw their own conclusions.  In a world of minuscule sound bites, sensationalized ""journalism"" and fabricated ""facts"" this is a refreshing approach, indeed.
The visuals are great; the narration is better.  The host / director does a marvelous job of engaging with people and culture while informing us all.
I will be encouraging my parents, children, and friends to partake.",1391731200,,1009,4.825581395348837
8511873,3,B0077PBPUA,"Propaganda about the scenes about america's productivity, u can have more productivity with less workers and make them work faster and harder 4 the same amount of pay until they break down just like a machine.  Employers would do anything 2 get ride of human workers if they could.  Also the asian chick that help creating those robots (at the end) doesn't think they will someday take over the world, LOL!!! U never know!!!!!",1379894400,2,426,4.743243243243243
