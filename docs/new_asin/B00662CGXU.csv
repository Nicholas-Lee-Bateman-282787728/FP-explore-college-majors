They should have more shows like this in the US.",1389398400,,100,4.0
8493633,4,B00662CGXU,"I took off a star because instead of complete season it season 2 part 1 so some of my favorite season 2 episodes didn't make  the cut.

WINGIN IT was a great show. Especially if your looking for something whole family can watch without worrying such problems as language and the type of sight gags that are used in much of today comedy series that not suitable for all ages.  One of the things that makes this season an improvement on first is they replaced the annoying raccoon with Denise a 2nd AIT who follows the rules even less than Porter and shakes up Carl's life even more than it had been in his road to popularity.",1384128000,,624,4.316239316239316
8493634,5,B00662CGXU,"For those who have seen season one of ""Wingin' It"", Season 2 Part 1 is more of the same--and that's a good thing.  This is a family friendly show--no violence, language, or sensuality.  Another plus, Season 2 got rid of the annoying raccoon.",1362355200,,241,4.5813953488372094
