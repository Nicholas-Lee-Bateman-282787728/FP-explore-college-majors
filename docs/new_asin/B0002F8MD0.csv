8027841,5,B0002F8MD0,"This is great for libraries and the classroom. If you need something short to follow
a read aloud story. Includes well known children's programs. Barney is 30 minutes but the other programs are about 15 minutes.",1356220800,,211,4.888888888888889
8027842,5,B0002F8MD0,"I personally thought the Barney part was a little long (ugh Barney!) but my 2 year old son didn't seem to mind.  Cute video, he watches the whole thing when it's on.  I am trying to prepare him for Halloween :)",1252800000,,210,4.097560975609756
8027843,5,B0002F8MD0,"We used to rent this DVD from our public library but it became too scratched to view.  I was happy to order it for my 3 year-old daughter who just loves it.  We mostly watch Barney (there's a very cute song about autumn) but we have watched all the others several times, also.  This is a great collection of halloween videos for children!",1227312000,,338,4.333333333333333
8027844,4,B0002F8MD0,"Both my 2-year daughter and 4-year son loved this DVD so much! I don't remember how many times they already watched. However if the part of Bob the Builder is little longer, I will give a 5-star. My kids are fans of Bob the Builder.",1226275200,,232,4.177777777777778
8027845,5,B0002F8MD0,My kids have watched this DVD a thousand times and they still aren't sick of it.  It's absolutely adorable and a great buy at that price!,1191974400,,137,4.269230769230769
