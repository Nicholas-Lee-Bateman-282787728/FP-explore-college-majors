So when it came time to adding it to my DVD collection, the question arose: Which series will I start with?  The answer came quicker than you can say ""Drink!"" Why not have all three at the same time?
I lost three days of my life watching every one of these classic episodes, and I don't regret it for a second.  Buy now!!!",1073260800,17,400,4.1688311688311686

1664717,5,B00005U8QR,"I am a huge fan of British television.  I love just about everything from the documentaries to the dramas and comedy.  How in the world Father Ted had flown under my radar I do not know.  My best friend recommended I watch a couple episodes on YouTube a couple of months ago and I loved it from the first minute!  I got on amazon and found a used set of the complete series in the UK and bought it straight away without having even seen most of the series.  My favorite amazon purchase yet!

I love all four of the main characters as they all bring something special to the series that makes it perfect.  Poor Father Ted Crilly is sent to VERY out of the way Craggy Island thanks to church money that was ""just resting in his account"".  That obviously tired money that needed a good rest before moving on into the church accounts follows poor Ted throughout the entire series, seems like.  The parish house on Craggy Island is also inhabited by Father Dougal McGuire and Father Jack Hackett.  Dougal is young and doesn't quite have a grasp on what it means to be a good priest.  His ""Blackrock Incident"" resulted in many nuns lives being ""irreparably damaged"" (do we REALLY need all the details on that one??) getting him a one-way ticket to Craggy Island.  In the very first episode he questions Ted as to whether they are really supposed to take things such as ""heaven and hell and everlasting life"" seriously.  Poor Dougal isn't the brightest bulb in the package but you can't help but love him anyway.  And then there's Father Jack Hackett.  He's more ancient than ancient and lives only to watch television and drink.  And drink.  And drink.  And drink.  And drink.  There's absolutely no question as to why he was sent to Craggy Island.  Does he love the women or the drink more?  That question is hard to answer!  Rounding out the group is Mrs. Doyle.  She is the housekeeper for the three priests and she has a serious love of making and serving tea.  She is crazy in her own right but she balances out the madness of Ted, Dougal and Jack beautifully.  They can often build off her strangeness creating some of the best scenes.

I would wager there isn't anyone who loves comedy, particularly British comedy, that can sit down and watch this show and not laugh at every single episode.  It's impossible.  Whether it is Ted trying to teach Dougal about toy cows being small and the cows outside the window being far away, Jack screaming for his ""DRINK!"", Mrs. Doyle's less than perfect safety record while doing regular household chores and maintenance or Ted and Dougals song for ""Eurosong 96"" about their ""lovely horse"", you will be laughing until you are in tears!  You'll even catch yourself adding a few Father Ted phrases and words into your every day language.

I'm so glad my friend suggested I watch Father Ted.  It just makes him an even better best friend, doesn't it?",1434153600,,2886,4.543689320388349

1664728,4,B00005U8QR,"I was introduced to Father Ted while living as an exchange student in Scotland in high school. I saw the third season while I was there and became an immediate fan.

First things first: this show is VERY British. If you're not a fan of British humor (or humour, I should probably say), I'm guessing there's a slim chance you'll find this enjoyable. If you do, though, you're in for a treat. To me, the first two seasons are a bit hit or miss with some definite slow parts. But the third season is so clever and funny that it makes the whole show worthwhile--and considering how few episodes there are, owning the whole series is worthwhile if only for the sake of feeling complete. The Christmas bonus episode is also a holiday staple of mine.

Highly recommended for the British comedy enthusiast.",1338163200,2,798,4.573426573426573

1664734,5,B00005U8QR,"Father Ted began airing on British channel 4 in 1995 and ran for three series until 1998 when Dermot Morgan (Father Ted Crilly) announced he was moving on.

Three wayward and exiled Catholic Priests share a house on Craggy Island, somewhere off the west coast of Ireland along with their tea and sandwich obsessed housekeeper, Mrs Doyle.

The Priests are Father Ted Crilly, the only one of the four who is decidedly ""normal"" exiled by Bishop Len Brennan for stealing charity money. Ted proclaims his innocence at every opportunity, insisting the money was just Resting in his account. Father Dougal McGuire is a simple minded, childlike person with a fear of women and absolutely no belief in God or Catholocism whatsoever. He describes his career as a Priest as ""a bit of a laugh"". He constantly annoys Ted with his stupidity and came to be on the Island after an incident known only as ""Blackrock"" which involved Nuns. Father Jack Hackett is an elderly priest who is constantly drunk and will drink anything he can get his hands on, including Toilet Duck and Floor Polish (which temporarily kills him) he does not have a liking for water, however and spends most of his time asleep in his chair. He was considered the ""Breakout character"" on the show for his outbursts.

Any hope of a fourth series of Father Ted was dashed when Dermot tragically died of a Heart attack only a day after completing recording on the last episode.

Father Ted achieved massive popularity in Britain during it's run a popularity that continues strongly today with such festivals as ""Tedfest"" which has been going since 2007 and is held on the Irish island of Inishmore off the coast of Galway.

1664735,5,B00005U8QR,"I like when religion can have a sense of humor, and this series is a prime example of why. The characters are quirky, the writing clever and fun, the situations ludicrous, all while poking a little fun at Catholicism but never being disrespectful. My favorite scene is Chris (the unhappy sheep) with the earphones on in their living room--so silly! The parallels and competitions between Ted and his nemesis, Dick, are so funny. Their lives are so similar, you'd think they'd be best friends rather fostering such a rivalry!

I did find the extras a little sparse and disappointing, but was thrilled that any were included at all. I agree with a previous reviewer who stated that they were surprised there was no tribute to Dermot Morgan included in the extras. I hadn't thought about it, but that does seem to be a bit of an oversight.",1295308800,,836,4.687074829931973
1664736,5,B00005U8QR,"If you like British humor, you will love this series. Set on Craggy Island with a host of eccentric characters.",1280880000,,111,4.6
1664737,5,B00005U8QR,"Once upon a time, on an Irish island so small that it didn't appear on the maps, there lived these three priests... yeah, it sounds like the setup for a joke or a really bad religious story.

Fortunately it turns out to be the theme for ""Father Ted - The Holy Trilogy,"" a kooky comedy about a trio of painfully unholy priests -- moderately crude, quite goofy, and full of insanity. The series gets progressively weirder as it follows the adventures of the titular character and his drunken and/or idiotic sidekicks, and the cast is absolutely brilliant.

On Craggy Island, there's a single Catholic parish run by three priests -- long-suffering Father Ted (Dermot Morgan), half-witted Father Dougal (Ardal O'Hanlon), and deranged foul-mouthed lecherous alcoholic Father Jack (Frank Kelly). They also have a crazy housekeeper obsessed with tea. The priests aren't exactly holy, since all three have been exiled there for various misdeeds.

Over the three seasons, the priests encounter the hostile bishop, a sexy author, a dead-boring houseguest, the worst priest in the world, a trio of bishops, TV hosts, a radical feminist rocker, a slutty milkman, a nervous sheep, and a hardcore nun who could double as an inquisitor.

They have to deal with the blasphemous pornographic film ""The Passion of St. Tibulus,"" a plague of rabbits, a costume competition, bishop buttkicking, bomb-carrying milk floats (""Ted, I wanna be a priest again!""), Ted's reputation as a racist, priests lost in the vast lingerie department, an about-to-crash plane full of priests, giving up their vices for Lent, entering a singing competition, raffling a car (which Ted has wrecked), a stolen whistle, a disastrous seaside holiday, an appearance on ""Faith of Our Fathers"" and the apparent death of Father Jack.

Small warning: ""Father Ted"" is definitely not for anyone who wants an all-sparklyhappysunshiny depiction of Catholic clergy, because... well, there's a reason these guys were exiled to Craggy Island. Except for despair, I'm pretty sure the priests on this show manage to commit all the seven deadly sins, plus Dougal's unofficial sin of mind-blowing idiocy.

And it's quite funny. It's not quite as funny as ""Blackadder"" or ""Fawlty Towers,"" but it's got plenty of entertaining stuff here. There's lots of slapstick, strange problems (""Ah no, not Toilet Duck again!""), hilarious dialogue (""Imagine blowing your head off with a shot-gun. How'd he manage to survive that?"" ""He didn't, Dougal... he died""), and the priests being rather unpriestly (one of them may actually be a monkey disguised as a priest).

Morgan is quite good as the ""straight man"" of the cast, who is the most normal despite having stolen charity money -- he's constantly dealing with the idiocy around him with a kind of resigned patience (""He loved children... they were terrified of him, though""). O'Hanlon is thoroughly entertaining as the peabrained Dougal, Kelly makes a wonderful gnarled old drunken coot (""FECK! DRINK! GURLS!""), and Jim Norton has a small role as a hostile bishop with a dirty little secret.

""Father Ted - The Holy Trilogy"" features the worst Catholic parish in the world, if you consider both priests and parishioners. But it does make for some very funny comedy.",1279065600,3,3244,5.130681818181818

1664741,5,B00005U8QR,"If you ever thought that British humor was dry, well, irish humor or at least Father Ted makes it seem quite succulent and juicy by comparison.

Dermot Morgan (the inventor and lead actor in this series) was a comic genius with an incredible imagination.  The humor is both crude, surreal, deeply sarcastic, slapstic and dry all at the same time.  There is incredible satire here, but in an innocent way which seems to acknowledge reality without having a harshly critical attitude towards anyone.  You can't come away from watching Father Ted without somehow having sympathy for the foolishness and innocence of it's characters.  Ultimately, it is a gentle mockery of the irish church for the stereotypes that everyone knows are largely true.  I believe this is why the nation of Ireland and even the church realized that Dermot Morgan had given Ireland a great gift.

Alas, he died all too young.

1664751,5,B00005U8QR,"Rather than rehash what this is about(you can read that in most of the other reviews) I'd like to tell you how much I love this series and why.  I'm a huge fan of Britcoms: Blackadder, Ab Fab, My Hero & Catherine Tate to name a few.  If you like that slightly bizarre, offbeat humor, this is definately for you.  However, if you are easily offended by those who poke fun at religion or satirize it's quirks and shortfalls, you probably won't like this.  It's a very funny look at the Catholic Church through the eyes of three outcast priests and their kooky housekeeper.  I am Catholic and I don't like vulgar or mean spirited humor and that is not what this is.  It's a more sophisticated, almost slapstick type humor with wonderful characterizations and situations, and the dialog is genius! Ardal O'Hanlon is magnificent and Dermot Morgan is just a joy to watch.  At first I was not crazy about the character of Father Jack (in fact I really didn't like him at all) but he grows on you and eventually you realize how important he is to  the hilarity of the situations.  How sad that this series ended after only 3 seasons with the untimely death of Dermot Morgan.  What a great comedian. He is definately missed.  I feel for sure this series would have run for years if we had not lost him so young.  If you have a well developed sense of humor, and don't take life too seriously, you'd be an eejit to miss this!

He lives with a younger priest Father Dougal who is a good natured imbecile and Father Jack who is an aging , drunk mess.

They find themselves in a variety of situations in each epsiode that are absolute comedic genius. The show is a must for anyone who is either of Irish decent, Catholic or both and for those who are not the humor will still come through.

My son and I watch it togther and we have had a few belly laughs, even though it is really off beat.

1664767,4,B00005U8QR,"I have loved Father Ted since I was introduced to it on BBC America.  The comedy is distinctly British, or what I think of as British, and its blend of dry wit and slapstick truly keeps you laughing.  You can't help but sympathize with Father Ted's plight.  That being said, this is not for the Catholic viewer that can't laugh about the historical and current problems within the church.  I am Catholic, and sometimes I cringe at the jokes, but overall, it's a good natured ribbing at our all too public problems.  The bottom line is, I find myself laughing, but sometimes feeling a bit guilty after watching the show.  The characters are very well developed, and their actions are always in line with their personalities, something I find lacking in most of today's American ""sit coms.""  If you're a fan of Monte Python and have the stomach for religious jokes, this is an excellent series.",1181174400,5,892,4.67948717948718

1664769,5,B00005U8QR,"There is just something about the ""Father Ted"" brand of humor that will just have you rolling on the floor. Maybe it's the consent jabs at the Catholic religion or the dim wit of Father Dougal, but whatever it may be this is one of the best comedies I've seen in the last few years hands down. If you only watch one episode of this series it must be the one in which Father Dougal becomes a milkman. Father Ted outs the islands original milkman for being a ladies man when there is a baby boom of babies looking exactly like the ""Chewbacca"" looking fellow. The milkman seeks revenge in the form of placing a bomb on Dougal's milk truck a la ""Speed"" and the truck must stay above 4 miles per hour. Yet, the saddest thing about this series is that Dermot Morgan, the actor who played Ted, actually died of a heart attack just as the third series was wrapped. I don't think another actor could play this part as well as he did.",1178496000,,924,4.255681818181818

1664774,5,B00005U8QR,"It is probably cheaper and better to buy the box set as there are 5 episodes per disc and 4 discs in total. Father Ted ran for three seasons for a total of 25 episodes. The sound is Dolby 2.0 Stereo. The frame is 1.33:1. Season one episode one introduces us to Craggy Island in ""Good Luck, Father Ted"". Instantly within the first minute you are hit with several outragous gags involving either Ted refusing tea from a very hyperactive Mrs. Doyle, Dougle's dream about the Spider-baby which he thinks is real or Father Jack attacking the television in his drunken senility. The star of this show though is Tom, the guy with the I SHOT J.R. t-shirt and the shotgun who blows away the friendly crow. ""Entertaining Father Stone"" is more of the same but here additional priests are introduced, a constant theme that would continue through to the end. Fr. Paul Stone has the reputation of being the most boring man on Earth and nearly drives Ted & co insane. ""The Passion of St Tibulus"" is a classic episode that involves the hysterical Dougle one-liner about the son that wins all hands down. It also features a real life take on a Irish Bishop who got his cousin in America pregnant. This is the make or break episode that put Father Ted on the map. Repeat viewing is mandatory. ""Competition Time"" sees Ted, Dougle and Jack compete in a pop idol contest on Craggy Island that is exclusive for priests. From the drunken judge who smashes up the priest's home to the three stages of Elvis competition finale, this is a classic howl-a-second episode.  ""And God Created Women"" sees Ted up to more priestly things when romantic novelist Polly Clarke seems to be coming onto him.  ""Grant Unto Him Eternal Rest"" is a funny episode about cocaine cakes and a close call with death. Unfortunately Season one is very short with only 5 episodes. The budget is somewhat limited as it was a UK based Channel 4 funded show of an Irish production. It would not air in Ireland until after Season one was over. It was Ireland that responded in a way that caused Father Ted to become a sensational event where pubs would all go quiet to watch it. Catholic Ireland loved it so much that Father Ted was given a budget boost injection to double the episodes for an 11 episode Season two.. **As a note the discs where not in the best condition as Disc 1 had some playback errors in Episodes Two and Three.**

Season two gets a bigger budget. Instead of ploughing costs into vamping up the sets and characters, the producers have rightly chosen to keep the original low budget feel and just double the amount of episodes for the year which is why Season two is broken up into Part 1 and Part 2 packages of 5 episodes + 5 episodes. Region 1 of Season two has both parts in one package on two discs. Region 2 sells the parts separately. ""Hell"" is about a cavern holiday that goes terribly wrong. The scene with the toy cows is a classic. Father Noel and other reoccurring characters turn up here and throughout the season. ""Think Fast, Father Ted"" has Ted and Dougle rigging a raffle to try and repair a car they trashed which had been donated to the parish.  ""Tentacles of Doom"" is about the Holy Stone of Clonrichert which manages to find its way up a Bishop's behind no thanks to Jack.  ""The Old Grey Whistle Theft"" sees Dougle implicated in the theft of a whistle when he meets up with young bad-boy priest ""Damo"" who gets up to all sorts of tricks. ""A Christmassy Ted"" is about group of priests who get lost in Ireland's largest lingerie store and only Father Ted can get them out... Vietnam style. Hysterical stuff.

Part 2 has the ""The Plague"" with Bishop Brennan back to the problem of Father Jack sleepwalking in the nude and Dougle's pet rabbit overpopulation. ""Rock-a-Hula Ted (aka Lovely Girls)"" leaves Dougal in charge of the house when he gets a visit from a feminist type Sinead O` Conner who takes over the home. ""Cigarettes and Alcohol and Rollerblading"" is one big withdrawel from drugs because of Lent where things go crazy for everyone. New Jack City is about Jack's retirement to the old folks home and is replaced by Father Fintan Stack, who is even worse. Ted and Dougle work out a plan to break Jack out so he can defeat Father Stack. ""Flight into Terror"" has Ted back in hero form trying to save a plane of priests from crashing. Season two is all cracking good stuff.

It is unknown if Season three was supposed to be another Season one with a shorter run of 6 episodes or 10 episodes as Season two did. In the end we get 8 episodes of Season three. ""Are You Right There, Father Ted?"" has Ted accidentally appearing looking like Hitler after he is mistaken by a local Chinese community as a fascist. ""Chirpy Burpy Cheap Sheep"" is the King of the Sheep 98' competition. If you like sheep you will like this one. ""Speed 3"" may be one of the funniest television episodes ever when Dougal's milk float is rigged to explode if he drops below 4 mph. This episode is widely considered one of the best, if the not the best comedy TV instalments ever aired. ""The Mainland"" sees Ted & co. leaving Craggy Island for a trip when all hell breaks loose. Jack goes to an AA meeting! If you want to see a 5 a side - over 75 - football match then look no further than ""Escape from Victory"". Will Ted's fake rubber arms fool the referee? ""Kicking Bishop Brennan up the A*se"" is exactly what it means. Here Ted in a forfeit to Dick Burn must kick Bishop Brennan while Dougal takes the photograph. It is a gem in the series. ""Night of the Nearly Dead"" is a pull on the Irish singer Daniel O' Donnel who is loved by all women over the age of 50. Here he visits Craggy Island to see Mrs. Doyle only for Ted to find that the house is under siege by the elderly-zombies who are dying to see their favorite singer. ""Going to America"" is the final episode of the series. Her Ted is offered his own parish in California which he thinks he can cash in on. The only catch is that he can't take Dougle, Jack or Mrs. Doyle with him. It ends with a lovely montage of all the episodes. It appears that this episode may have been the last one on the schedule to be shot and that there was talk that Father Ted would end with this season. After shooting Dermot Morgan (Father Ted) announced that ""I don't want to be the next Clive Dunn and end up playing the same character for years."" This was taken to mean that effectively the Father Ted series had finished. He said that he was working on a new comedy television series. It is believed that this would be about two retired football players living together, but just weeks before the first episode of Season three was to air, during a dinner party in his home, Dermot Morgan had a sudden massive heart attack and died. He was only 45. It seems that the ending of last episode of Season three is still cut short as if something has been removed and the montage put in instead. It actually ends on a sort of a sad note, happy, but sad and a tribute to this great character, man and series. There was nothing like Father Ted and there will never be again.",1169769600,6,7066,4.40168324407039

If you like outrageous British comedy, this is a must-have. But even if you don't, it's a must have. One of the amazing things about it is that we have shared our set with all kinds of people, and they ALL find it wonderful.

Be warned: the catch-phrases are pervasive and cannot be resisted. We counter the obvious with ""Oooh, that's right, Ted."" We greet friends at dinner with cries of ""Drink!"" We urge dessert with ""Go on. Go on. Go on."" And as fans know, almost anything can be answered with, ""That's a ecumenical matter.""

A recent Father's Day was celebrated with selections from our set of Father Ted and my parents, who usually do not get British comedy at all, were in tears and asked for more! The Christmas episode is now one of our Holiday Classics.

So yes, go on go on go on. Get the whole set. We started with one, lent it constantly, and wound up giving it to a friend when we went for the complete series, so SHE could complete her collection.

The comedy shows a clergy cross section with 3 generations of priests living together  and it definitely leaves no illusions about this church history (Father Jack) and no hopes about its future (Father Dougal).
We can see an old priest being a lecherous drunkard and a young priest as a naive imbecile, too stupid to be either lecherous or a drunkard (though, in due time, he will get to it...), and I cannot grasp how the middle-aged priest (Father Ted) is more or less normal - he just does not fit into the priests' life-cycle on this island.
This commendy is not as funny as, say, Are you being served or Black Adder, or Blue Thin Line or even Bottom (the Bottom heroes' insanity is the closest to that of Father Ted priests, imo), but one will surely enjoy watching it!",1161302400,,999,4.459016393442623
1664785,5,B00005U8QR,"Some of the finest moments in Television comedy have come from the BBC. I remember first viewing Monty Python with my brother who had tried to explain the great comedy of the Python cast. I did not understand until the night he made me sit and watch. This was mind-blowing I was hooked ! and nearly  the same time was ""The Goodies"" another brilliantly funny show. (not yet available on DVD.)Then along came the likes of the Young ones, Fawlty Towers,Black Adder, And so many others. These were all no punches pulled, all out brazenly funny, often hilarious, sometimes strange shows that would at best, and often, leave you on the floor trying to catch your breath. All shared a talent for building a comedy piece with  great timing and acting . Each laugh bigger than the one before until you were caught in a tidal wave of laughter .So it is as well with Father Ted .I have to agree with the other reviews who proclaim it to be one of the funniest shows of all time ! If you enjoyed Fawlty Towers, and if you were lucky enough to see and remember The Goodies. I am sure you will enjoy Father Ted and the rest of his Banished brethren on Craggy island . Dirty old father Jack who has had more than a few to many and  is more often than not in a drunken stupor.  Who when  conscious is busy unleashing a steady torrent of vulgarities while in search of another drink, seldom knowing his whereabouts or anything else for that matter .Then there is  young Father Dougle, dimwitted to the point of exacerbation, naive and always exuberant. His lack of intellect plays well with his wide eyed innocence and always with great result .Finally to fill out the holy trinity you have Father Ted who is as close as one can come to a straight man .(in the sense that Newhart was something of a straight man in his great show ""Newhart"") Each of these outcast priests has embarrassed the church in one way or another and continue to do so through circumstance .They are aptly served by Loyal housekeeper Mrs. Doyle and her teapot .What a joy ! This is one of the very best of TV comedies. It is not as far over the edge as say ""The Young Ones "" It is more grounded if that is what one can say about ""Faulty Towers"" .Everyone who I have shared my well used DVD set with has loved this show. .Always a laugh whenever Father Ted reaches for the phone to call a fellow Priest .I cannot recommend this show enough so if you have enjoyed the other shows I mentioned you will have a treat in store for you when you get to view this treasure. I am sure You will love this crazy cast and wish for more. Buy the complete set it is money well spent ! The 5 star reviews I have read have been spot on .I just had to add my voice to the many fans of such a great show.

1664786,5,B00005U8QR,"I'm an Australian, so I can't speak to the specific complete US box set in terms of packaging, except that it's not very cheap (but it's not very cheap here either), so I'll confine this to the episodes themselves, and assume they have the same extras and general menu lay out.

Quite simply, Father Ted was the most brilliant British (Irish in this case) sitcom to emerge since, Blackadder. It is firmly in the surrealist tradition, which you might trace from The Goons to Monty Python, to Young Ones, to Father Ted. What makes FT different is its magical ability to cross generational boundaries. My 73 year old mother loves it. Normally my 73 year old mother loves atrocious britcoms like 'George and Mildred' or 'Are you being served?'. But hardcore surrealist nutcases will love this at least as much. It's this brilliant fusion of character-based situation comedy, and completely insane plots which made this series such a huge winner.

As a comic writer myself, I regard 4 as a magic number, and in this case the four comprise the straight man (Ted), the two crazy/hilarious ones (Dougal/Jack), and the hilarious, straight/funny outrider (Mrs Doyle). The world of 'Craggy Island' is beautifully realised. There are only a few relatively dud epiodes, and they are far outweighed by the ROTFLMAO genius of most of the other eps.

These comments are intended, perhaps more for people considering buying individual seasons, and I should stress that all three seaons are must-haves.

Season 1 gives you a bit of background, which isn't really nescessary. The first ep is a killer, but the season has at least one relative dud. The characters were finding themselves to an extent.

Season 2 (the longest, and usually considered the best) goesn't suffer from any major clangers, but I'm not sure it suffers from quite as many masterpieces as they'd have you believe. Still, it's superb, and quibbling over such things is splitting hairs.

Season 3, which for some reason gets maligned somewhat, is, IMO, the best of the lot, and FWIW the writers apparently thought so, too. It gets off to a roaring start with three absolute classics. A Nazi Catholic Priest with a huge collection of war memorabilia; a milk truck with a bomb on it, set to go off if the *SPEED* drops below 4 mph, and the funniest reference to 2001: a Space Oddesey ever seen (it involves a lip-reading sheep).

The classic lines from this series are almost endles (check out imdb), and the best episodes rate up there wqith Fawlty Towers or Young Ones.

If you loved British Comedies like Monty Python, Ripping Yarns, Fawlty Towers, The Goodies, Blackadder, and The Young Ones, you absolutely have to own this. Don't think twice. Take my word for it. The cast are individually magnificent, and collectively magical.

If your idea of Britcoms is more George nd Mildred, or Are you Being Served, you may still like it, but I wouldn't bet on it.

Bishop Facks: So, Father. Do you ever have any doubts about the religious life? Is your faith ever tested? Anything you would be worried about? Any doubts you've been having about any aspects of belief? Anything like that?

Father Dougal: Well, you know the way God made us all, right? And he's looking down at us from heaven and everything?

Bishop Facks: Uh-huh.

Father Dougal: And then his son came down and saved everyone and all that?

Bishop Facks: Yes.

Father Dougal: And when we die we're all going to go to heaven?

Bishop Facks: Yes. What about it?

Father Dougal: Well, that's the bit I have trouble with.

Running around with the man on your back, like a train in the night, like a train in the (hold on I can play this bit) NIGHT

That is the funniest episode of Father Ted, A Song For Europe with the ""obligatory video"", but there are so many great episodes of Father Ted you really have to own them all.  Possibly my favourite comedy of all time, although I already owned series 1&3 on video as soon as I saw this box set I knew it was a must buy.  Father Ted first aired back in 1995 and to be honest I didn't find the first series that funny, it was alright and I watched every episode but I wouldn't have called it essential viewing.

However as soon as I saw the first episode of the second series I knew the series had hit the big time.  It was called ""Hell"" and feature the first guest appearance from Graham Norton as Father Noel Furlong, it was hilarious.  Every episode from then on until Dermot Morgan's tragic death was superb.  I don't know what makes it so funny, there's just something about three completely incompetent priests sharing a house in a backwater parish.  You have Father Jack Hackett who is an Alcoholic and generally only utters the words ""FECK"", ""AR*E"" or ""GIRLS"", the incredibly stupid Father Dougal Maguire and then of course Father Ted.  I don't know how popular the show is in America but over here they are still showing repeats on Channel 4's various other channels.

I love every episode from the last two series but ones you should particularly check out are ""Speed 3"" the brilliant parody of Speed (If the milkfloat goes under 4 miles an hour the bomb will go off).  ""The Mainland"" which also features Graham Norton, who is the funniest guest character and ""Escape To Victory"" all back to back in Series 3.  The funniest ever though is of course ""A Song For Europe"", especially their final performance live at the Eurovision Song Contest after they find out the music they ""borrowed"" was more famous than they first thought.

I could go on all day but you get the general idea, this is a must have for any fans of good comedy.  The only people who you find criticising this are devout religious types with a lack of a sense of humour, must buy!",1141776000,15,2352,4.382488479262673

1664797,5,B00005U8QR,"Father Ted is a classic of modern British television and choc-ful of belly laughs. Three Irish Catholic priests, all misfits in their own peculiar way, are sent to the weird but wonderful world of Craggy Island on the west coast.

Sheer words cannot describe just how funny this brilliant sitcom is. Low budget it may be (take a look at the Craggy island funfair episode, its so cheaply done it's genius), but the writing and acting is quite brilliant and there is not one bad episode. The late Dermot Morgan (as Ted) is so good you couldn't envisage anyone else in the role. Ted is a competent priest whose heart really isn't in the job, and to top that off he has to deal with his housemates, Father Dougal (a young idiot) and the alcoholic, angry Father Jack. To make things worse he also has to deal with a mental housekeeper in Mrs Doyle, a hateful Bishop Brennan,mad nuns and a load of other colourful characters. Ted's existence is precarious at times but somehow he keeps things together.

This show was actually made for the British commercial station, Channel 4 (who also showed the excellent comedy series 'spaced', made by the same team who did the film 'Shaun of the dead') but the BBC have the world wide dvd rights. I doubt if it will ever get shown on US terrestrial channels because of the bad language (although it is used to great comedic effect), and its subject matter (the catholic church). However it is anything but blasphemous, and gently mocks religion without being vindictive. It also gently mocks the Irish people but in an affectionate way that even the irish find funny. Irish Americans should not be allowed to call themselves this without at least watching the show. Irish and British humour are not that far apart and the sheer ludicrousness of Father Ted is what makes it tick. It is also a brilliant character based comedy that will have you in stitches. Irish writers Graham Linehan & Arthur Matthews haven't written anything near as good since this show finished in 1998. Also, watch out for Graham Nortons hilarious cameo appearances.

My favorite episode? Every show is great but the one where Ted is accused of being a racist when he inadvertently insults the local chinese population (on Craggy Island!!!) is a total scream. The episode which spoofs the Keanu Reeves film 'Speed' is also wonderful. Actually, buy this set now and watch them all, you won't regret it.",1138492800,7,2408,4.728571428571429

The two best ones I like the most is Father Ted kicking Bishop Brennan right stright up the arse and Father Jack telling Bishop Brennan to ""FECK OFF"" and decked him in the nose, oh and telling Bishop's sarcastic assistant that he is soooo soooo sorry for running his mouth at the Bishop. I guess even in church we got to have some good hysterically fun. I won't put it pass it if it even cracks Jesus Christ him self up.",1135641600,4,687,4.172932330827067

From the first episode, I found myself not just chuckling, but full-out laughing at this show and before I was done with the first of the five discs, I was convinced the set was worth every cent I'd paid.

Somewhere during the second season, tragedy nearly struck.  During Ted and Dougal's caper of hiding a herd of wild bunnies from a bishop who is afraid of rabbits, a series of jokes were grouped too closely together!  I hadn't stopped laughing from the first when the second hit me.  By the time the scene culminated in an impeccibly delivered punchline, I couldn't breathe and fell to the floor gasping and choking for air.  My girlfriend, who watched the entire event in disbelief, declared it a miracle I hadn't wet my pants.

I heard great things about this show and put this set on my Wish List almost a year before finally purchasing it after several failed attempts to have a friend tape a few episodes off BBC America.

1664800,5,B00005U8QR,"Tied for the greatest situation comedy of all-time with BBC's ""the Office"" in my opinion.

Some PC wussies may get offended by the concept of three inept Catholic priests banished to the small and strange Craggy Island, especially they find out that one is a raving drunken lunatic, one has the personality of an idiotic child and the other has the nasty habit of having church charity money ""rest"" in his personal bank account.  But who cares what they think?  This is a show for people who want a good pure laugh.  And besides, this show could have been about three fireman or even three chefs; the fact that they are priests is inconsequential.

Buy this set and be happy in knowing that you will be the owner of one of the greatest comedic works to ever grace television.

1664801,5,B00005U8QR,"I first saw commercials for this show on BBC America.  I questioned if a show about priests could skirt being offensive, and still be funny.  Thankfully they skipped the skirting and focused on the funny part.  After watching a couple episodes on TV, I had to get this set.  This show is hilarious!  Although, not one to watch with the kids.
Fr.'s Ted, Dougal, and Jack each have each been sent to remote Craggy Island as both a pennence for their misdeeds, and to get them out of public visibility.  Along with with their oddball housekeeper Mrs. Doyle, they are the funniest Brits I've seen since the Black Adder, Baldrick and their cohorts.
All 3 series(seasons) are great. Ted battles his own personal shortcomings to try and do what's right and get back in good standing with church. Naturally, the harder he tries the more of a mess is made. Ironically, it often works out best when he acts in not so fatherly a manner to get back and his rivals and superiors.  Dougal is a lovable idiot who just naturally has things go his way, and when they don't, he really doesn't know it anyway.  Jack is just plain disgusting, and seldom sober enough to utter a word from his chair pushed in the far corner of the room (of course, the word is normally ""drink!"").
Their faults are many, but a lot less troubling than many real life church issues, and so much funnier!  You cannot help but root for these lovable failures!",1125705600,5,1416,4.52156862745098

1664804,5,B00005U8QR,"Father Ted is set on a fictional island which is populated by insane people.  If you sit down and watch it, you'll find that Father Ted is the only character who you can relate to in the show. Father Ted sees the absurd things that happen around him in the same way that we see it. The only difference is that Ted encounters this behaviour from day to day, and often rebukes it with sarcasm and wit, whereas we, the viewers, accept the absurd behaviour with laughter and glee... In that regard, Ted is a bit like Rowan Atkinson in Blackadder, who, when seeing the absolute absurdity of the characters around him, he isn't affraid to sarcasticlly and scornfully rebuke them. Ted is like Blackadder, but more tolerant.

Unlike Father Ted, Blackadder cheifly depends on the sarcastic humour of Rowan Atkinson for most of it's laughs. All the other roles in Blackadder are bitpart roles designed to produce enviroments where Rowan Atkinson's sarcastic humour can be employed. In other words, Edmound Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson) is the centre of the show. Father Ted, on the other hand, creates a huge community of lovable characters who serve as alternative outlets for comedy. Father Ted, like The Simpsons before it, is able to master every kind of comedy due to it's wonderful wealth of characters. Father Dougal, Ted's accomplice, 'is' the most simplistic and feebleminded character in comedy history. Totally incapable of any logical or coherent thought, he is like a naive, yet very affable and loveable child. His creation was inspired by Trigger out of only fools and horses and Homer Simpson out of the Simpsons, and in my opinion, surpasses them both. With hilarious lines like: ""I'm not good at judging large crowds, Ted, but there must be fifteen million of them out there"" and ""who would ever imagined being struck by lightening would land you in hospital,""  he's definetly the funniest character in the show. Then there's Father Jack who is a disgruntled, violent and very unpleasant old man. He get's pushed around in a wheel chair by his housemates, but he can walk, and even run when he wants to. He shouts aggresively at anyone who rouses him from his sleep, and will drink any alcohol which is in his proximity. He will also drink anything which gives the effects of alcohol like varnish or Toilet Duck. Then there's Bishop Brennon, Ted's permantly outraged, quick to anger and ruthlessly sadistic overseer. He's a little reminicent of Mr Burns out of The Simpsons. Then there's father Noel (played by Graham Norton) who is an annoying, childlike, sugar addicted priest who can't stop talking. And the young TV presenter, whose name escapes me, but whose arrognant youthfulness, appalling rudeness, and inability to do anything without help is both lovable and destestable at the same time.

Father Ted was largely inspired by the Simpsons, and learnt a lot of it's comedy from it. It's wealth and array of lovable characters, it's total mastery of visual comedy and it's ability to marry the surreal and the real world together is very reminicent of The Simpsons. Also, Father Ted, just like the Simpsons, can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of their age. If there are any despondent Simpsons fans out there who are upset about the horrendous state of the show now, then I can only recommend Father Ted as the perfect remedy for that.

Can we say absolutely hysterically funny!  Watch as Father Dougal states on television that he doesn't really believe in organized religion.

Witness Father Ted, Father Dougal and their devoted, if quite mad, housekeeper, Mrs. Doyle tie Father Jack in his wheelchair for one of those nice walks that he enjoys so much.

Witness the antics of a married couple named John and Mary who are sweet as pie in front of clergy, but try to kill and/or maim each other when there are no priests around.

Hear Father Jack recite his entire vocabulary of ""Drink, feck, girls, arse,"" in every hilarious episode.  Feast your eyes on the cover they have on the back of their couch of the Sacred Heart Of Jesus, which I describe as the Catholic equilvalent of a picture of Elvis on black velvet!

Go on holiday with Our Heros and see them encounter Graham Norton, playing a priest.  Feel the excitement as Ted and Dougal kidnap Father Jack from an Old Priest's Home!  Watch with amazement as hordes of bunny rabbits follow Father Jack everywhere!
