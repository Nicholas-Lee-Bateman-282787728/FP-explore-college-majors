8354583,4,B00004R7F2,"OK boys & girls, this is it: The ""Citizen Kane"" of puking punk necrophiliac movies.  The gut-warming tale of a lab assistant, working for a delightfully over-the-top mad scientist, who sleeps with a corpse & wakes up with the granddaddy of all STDs... the ""Rot"" ~ a top secret bio-weapon created by her boss.  There's lots of gooey fun as she procedes to give it to her punk-rock playmates, and they race for a cure before they literally rot alive.  Well written, perfectly paced, and with exceptionally good make-up effects, this one's a gorefest with a wry sense of humor, and an unerring sense of fun.  Pop it in your VCR, grab your barfbags, and let 'er rip.",989884800,,662,4.584745762711864
8354584,5,B00004R7F2,"Remember that one film, the one about some sweet kids in a badneighborhood that really made you stop and think? Well this movie isnothing like that. Shot is sunny Florida. Rot is a fine peice of quality entertainment. It's shot by Marcus Koch- an up and comming horror director who has appeared in several publications- including Fangoria, The Tampa Tribune, and The Weekly Planet. ROT introduces Tiffany Stinky as the role of Sarah and Billly Scam- from the seminal Tampa Florida punk rock band, the Scams, as Muzzy. It also features Joel D. Wyncoop- Famous for Creep, and several other straight to video horror classics, as Dr. Robert Olson, a crazed doctor who creates a horrid trasnmutation virus. Preformances are stupendous, dificult roles required many of the actors to reach far from their every day lives to display their full range of acting ability. A+++, This film is sure to become a cult classic in the next few years. Take advantage and buy it now before it goes out of print.",954028800,4,991,4.8011695906432745
8354585,4,B00004R7F2,"This shot on video feature rises above most low-budget horror films.  a fine blend of sick gross out gags and dark comedy.  Necrophilla has never been so much fun.  The acting is surprisingnly decent !  &  the  effects are incredible for such a low budget.  if SCREAM 3 made you Yawn,  BLAIR WITCH cast a sleeping spell on you,  and WISHMASTER 2 had you  Wishing you didn't,  Then  treat yourself to a new level of Entertainment,  with a little video called ROT !  its' a must see",951350400,3,480,4.367816091954023
