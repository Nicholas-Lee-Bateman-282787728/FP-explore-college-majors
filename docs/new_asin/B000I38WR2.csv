Love Westerns, Civil War themes, war themes, etc. I gave this horrible series Deadwood 3 episodes when it made it's debut years back. Horrible! Make no mistake, profanity laced language, ""The F-word"" ""the C-sucker word"" do not offend me. But what does offend me poor writing and writers who put the f-word and c-sucker in every freaking god-dang sentence. This show sucked. Reject, sorry. Watch Hell on Wheels now with (2) two fantastic seasons completed. Hell on Wheels is 5 stars, Deadwood is 2 stars if that. I'm thinking youngsters who have been brainwashed with modern poor writing, profanity laced movies like this Deadwood crap?",1355616000,,733,4.919354838709677
8143827,5,B000I38WR2,"I avoided watching this until it was too late, the series was cancelled.
Get past the language (a hard thing for me), and you have the best character development I ever saw on TV.
I bought the whole series and have watched it over and over.
Well worth seeing.",1296777600,,259,4.3061224489795915
