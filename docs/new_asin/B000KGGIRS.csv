8456097,4,B000KGGIRS,The film print is from a vhs copy but no big deal. The movie is a fun exploitation parody of tv game shows and features a lot of 70's porn actors and I enjoyed it and hope that a label like a Code Red could pick it up and do it some justice. I think fans of early 70's exploitation films would get a kick out of this flick but would probably not be too thrilled with the vhs quality of the dvd.,1336608000,,394,3.7590361445783134
