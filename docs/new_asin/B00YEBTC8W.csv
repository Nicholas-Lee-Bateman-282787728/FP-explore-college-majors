8718214,5,B00YEBTC8W,Just finished watching this fantastic series on Netflix and about to start Season 2!,1465948800,,84,5.071428571428571
8718215,5,B00YEBTC8W,"Fantastic!!  Wonderfully original story of quirky, if unstable, characters I fell in love with.  Great need for more rich, interesting stories with such  well-developed characters as this.  Only hope more episodes will be made.  Top notch all round.  (I traveled in Thailand in the 70's and really enjoyed the setting of 30 Degrees in February.)",1460764800,,345,5.181818181818182
8718216,5,B00YEBTC8W,"I gave this a try despite the subtitles (it's mostly in Swedish) and was very glad I did. The series follows the exploits, joys and sorrows of people who leave their native Sweden in search of a better life. There are three (mostly) separate storylines. Kajsa is a workaholic mother of two daughters who has suffered a stroke due to overwork and stress. Moving to Thailand is an attempt to escape the stresses of her native country and find a happier place (the family had previously vacationed in Thailand and loved it). Majlis and Bengt are an unhappily married couple. Majlis plays nursemaid to her obnoxious, spiteful and demanding husband Bengt. Majlis has been trapped in her marriage for many years, Thailand offers a change of pace and maybe more... Last but not least, Glenn is a lonely engineer (heating/cooling) looking for love in all the wrong places. He is a simple man on the surface, all he wants is to settle down and have a family. But Glenn also has a dark side that must be overcome if he is to find happiness. Really enjoyed this show.",1460246400,4,1056,4.622340425531915
8718217,4,B00YEBTC8W,"I agree with the first reviewer, this was an unexpected treat.  I've never been to Thailand and this really gave me some amazing insight.  That is what I am most grateful for.  The messages were honest and sometimes brutal.  That is always something I try to put on my mental plate.  Well done!",1457827200,,294,4.471698113207547
8718218,5,B00YEBTC8W,"I can't get over what an unexpected, wonderful surprise this 10-episode series was!  First of all, the photography is amazing.  The underwater shots - breathtaking!  The settings were beautiful, acting was very good (in most cases), writing was strong, and plot was different.  Finished it in record time.",1456963200,5,305,5.291666666666667
