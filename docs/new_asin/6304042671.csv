The story begins with a flood that damages homes and farms. Boats rescue people, others get vaccinations against disease (tetanus?). There are breadlines. People are housed in army tents. A land dealer offers 40 acre ranches for farming in Arizona. Is this deal too good to pass up? People sing on the bus trip. [A by-gone culture. Does this land look too dry?] Lullaby will try to sell his land. They learn of the scam: buying $2 an acre land and selling it for $50 an acre! [Do these scams still go on?] Can Stony and Tucson catch up? No, the deal stands. There is a fist fight with comedy. The sheriff warns them against starting trouble in town. People work the land and build homes. The town of ""Three Score and Ten"" will elect a mayor. Elmer makes a comic speech. The Judge is elected mayor. Stony sings to the crowd.

There is shocking news: the land is being condemned and will be underwater when a new dam is built! Flagg will clean up on this sale. Can this be stopped? With three signatures on a deed. Children shouldn't play with empty guns. There is comic talk for entertainment. Then a lone rider tells of an attack by masked riders, and a kidnapping for ransom. ""A swell spot for an ambush."" After delivering the deed they are fired upon. Judge Warren is released in poor health. Can they set a trap for Flagg? A dozen riders chase that wagon. The trap is sprung, Flagg's boys are defeated in a gun battle. The good guys win. Will Stony get to ride with Maryanne? Maybe.

This is an unusual story that may have been inspired by the Great Flood of 1937. Just barely an average movie, but it warns viewers against buying land that is out of state. Selling property to people and then foreclosing on it is still going on in the 21st century.",1287360000,,1780,4.420731707317073
