The DVD image quality is a little poor in the beginning of the film, showing lots of grain but fear not, the image gets better as the film progresses.  A major plus is that this DVD is presented in letterboxed widescreen, which is hard to find in many of the old school kung fu flicks.
The MAJOR problem with this DVD is the fact that many portions of the fights have been edited, to cut out the violence and gore. Key strikes, like when an opponent is killed are cut, confusing you on how certain battles are won.  Its chopped up so badly in some places that the action makes no sense, even if you go through the fight in slow motion.  Too bad...",1008115200,6,861,4.2
1074017,2,6305793158,"Let me say first, I am a huge fan of the Venoms movies, in the mid to late eighties Monday night was Kung Fu night on tv and the Venoms were the stars. I used to get a little frustrated with how they edited out some of the violence, but understood that movies are sometimes edited for television. Which brings me to Killer Army on DVD, I felt I was a young kid again watching the edited version, except all the death scenes are completely edited, if I had never seen this movie before I would be confused as to what is happening. All the fight scenes are chopped up even worse than when I watched as a teenager. All the blood and death scenes are pretty much gone. I have ordered quite a few of the Venoms flicks and I know not to always expect the best picture quality, but this is the first one I have recieved that is edited so bad. I really enjoyed the story and the parts of fight scenes you do see are great, but a die hard fan will be disappointed with the butchery of the film.",1007683200,,985,4.082474226804123
1074018,4,6305793158,"KILLER ARMY (1979) is a historical kung fu adventure starring the five actors collectively known as the Five Venoms. Like most of the Venoms films, it's got an engaging plotline, superb fight sequences, and strong production values provided by Hong Kong's Shaw Bros. studio. Set during a time of civil war when refugees are flooding into cities from the war-ravaged countryside, the film casts three of the five Venoms as refugees who team up to use their kung fu skills for maximum survival. When they are framed for the murder of an army colonel, they turn for help to a sympathetic militia faction, setting the stage for a spectacular final brawl on massive sets representing the city's waterfront.
The three main performers, Kuo Chui, Chiang Sheng and Lo Meng, were the best fighters (and actors) among the Five Venoms and they get plenty of opportunity to show their stuff, whether in straight-on hand-to-hand kung fu or in battles involving exotic weapons, such as the three-section staff favored by Kuo Chui in some scenes. (The other two Venoms, Sun Chien and Lu Feng, are among the villains.) It's a colorful, action-packed and consistently exciting Shaw Bros. kung fu movie, directed by the studio's top hand, Chang Cheh, who made nearly all of the Venoms films. Please note that the version of this film currently in distribution is missing approx. 12 minutes of footage.",1006646400,,1382,4.961206896551724
1074019,4,6305793158,"The Vemon Boys are back at it again. Lot of action and weapons. The fighters flying acrobatics are second to none. Also see 7 Deadly Venoms, Return of the & Deadly Venoms, Masked Avengers, Killer Army, Etc. Venoms have over 20 movies.",976579200,,234,4.595238095238095
7894967,3,6305793158,"I've loved the Venoms since I was a little girl. This is one of my faves and I was excited to get it. However, at the 31:21 & 31:39 marks there are glitches. Still on the fence about returning it or just living with it. For those glitches, I have to give a 5-star movie only 3 stars.",1495065600,,283,3.896551724137931

7894970,5,6305793158,"Another great VENOM classic.  But, be forwarned. This is a BOOTLEG copy with the english language.  Why Tokyo Shock or Dragon Dynasty haven't released this is movie is beyond me.  But, until that happens, this is the best we have.  I'm crossing my fingers for an official US release.",1362873600,3,283,4.714285714285714
7894971,4,6305793158,THIS WAS A GOOD MOVIE IN THAT I'M A MARTIAL ARTS FAN BUT THE VHS COPY WAS SO BAD A HAD TO TRADE IT IN WITH ABUNDATRADE FOR SOME TYPE OF COMPENSATION.,1315612800,,149,3.6875
7894972,4,6305793158,"Man I love this film. Lots of fights,all the main venom caste get to show there stuff. Kuo Chui  kicks butt with tables,benches and fights incredibly well with a three section staff. Lo meng steals the show with his awesome mantis moves. They venon cast gets framed for a murder and must escape town before they are killed.

Not much that I didn't like about this film. The storyline isn't worth mentioning,but most old school kung fu films didn't have great stories. My biggest gripe is how underutilized sun Chien was in the film. He had a awesome fight scene which was one of the best in the films in my opinion. It would have been nice to see him in at least another fight.

If you like old school martial arts films then buy this and you won't be unhappy with your purchase.",1254700800,,779,4.395833333333333
7894973,3,6305793158,"There is no question this is a 4 star performace,,,however, this is my synopsis on this flick: Definately another tough performance from the venom crew,,and I can't seemed to get enough of them.  However, it's starting to feel like if you've seen one it's like you've seen them all.  I have watched almost all the venom flicks, approximately 11 thus far,,and they now  seemed like the same old thing to me,,which apparently is getting profoundly boaring aswell.  For example in all the plots, usually the same guys are friends, and every-time the same one dude (Lo Meng, The Toad) ends up getting killed ,,,,with the exception, Return of The 5 Deadly Venom AKA Crippled Avengers.  Respectively,,,I also though the DVD transfer on this one was is kinda poor,,even the audio I find to be poorly transitioned!!",1150329600,,807,4.904411764705882
7894974,5,6305793158,"Plain and simple, the venoms are great.  In this movie the fight sequences are excellent, timing is insane.  The movie is a bit choped down, but it's still great.",1081900800,,162,4.551724137931035
7894975,5,6305793158,"The Venoms... the mere mention of the name will send any kung fu fan into a tirade about their awesome skill and unbeleivable fight choreography.  They were indeed super human beings and I beleive that no one has been able to match their god like abilities to this day.  Chang Cheh, who directs all the venoms flicks, does a wonderful job once again and I guarantee you will be consecutively amazed to the point where you will utter profanities whenever a fight scene occurs.  And man are there ever tons of fight scenes!  I recommend every Chang Cheh film I've seen and this one especially delivers, packed to the brim with kung fu goodness that has yet to be surpassed.",1022457600,,671,4.566666666666666
7894976,3,6305793158,"A Five Venoms classic from Chang Cheh, and a personal favourite of star Lo Mang.  Great fights, some character development, even a couple of female characters-- unusual in Chang's normally all-male world.
This is a film I've watched, taped and purchased often in the last fifteen years-- and I'm sorry to say that the print chosen for this DVD is not a good one.  There are sound quality problems, blackouts and repetitions in the sound, clumsy editing (it appears to have been assembled from two or more prints edited for television...).  It is definitely not the best print of this film, but as it IS the DVD print, it's likely to become the definitive version, to the chagrin of purists who have seen it uncensored and whole.",1010016000,5,728,4.716535433070866
