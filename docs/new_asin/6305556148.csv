1048160,5,6305556148,"""Just A Little Harmless Sex"" combines a universally laffable situation, a terrific cast, and some of the snappiest dialogue to come out of the independent filmmaking of the nineties.  Lauren Hutton makes a  return to the big screen with a brilliant performance as the sagely, yet  alluring matron, overseeing her thirty-something children and their  matrimonial indescretions.  Jonathan Silverman fans won't be disappointed  either.  I've screened this film a few times now and never fail to discover  new things to laugh at.  I'm sure this will pop up on top 10 lists in the  future as one of the best comedies of recent times for those fortunate  enough to have seen it.",948412800,3,672,4.963963963963964

7891669,5,6305556148,"This movie will have you laughing and make you wish you knew these people! Its funny, witty, laugh out loud comedy. The music is very good. The storyline is good. Great cast with Lauren Hutton, Johnathon Silverman just to name a couple. Its a very enjoyable movie for everyone",1301356800,,276,4.653061224489796
7891670,1,6305556148,"The dvd came on time and undamaged, but the quality of the dvd was very poor. In my opinion this dvd is a poor copy and not a used original. I do not recommend buying this dvd from this source.",1211673600,,193,3.85
7891671,4,6305556148,Worth a bowl of popcorn on a night you'd rather forget the madness of the world and watch people like your friends hurtle the silly/sweet challenges of social foreplay and that damn mating urge.  If only I didn't HAVE TO HAVE IT!,1129161600,4,229,4.4523809523809526
7891672,2,6305556148,"Those who like shows like ""Sex and the City"" will certainly enjoy this romantic comedy about a group of hip friends in their late twenties. Their problems are essentially trying (and mostly failing) to find a sex partner and eventually a loved one. Infidelity, friendship, maturity and life choices are some of the subjects present in this little movie, providing a couple of laughs but not many memorable scenes. The acting is competent, the pacing is ok, but the plot and direction are nothing to write home about. All in all, a watchable flick and an entertaining enough one, even if it doesn`t rise above average material.
Good to watch once.",1082592000,,646,4.828828828828829
7891673,5,6305556148,"Here is a film that pokes fun at both men & women, taking full advantage of every stereotype imaginable.  In short, it does precisely what a light Romantic comedy is supposed to do!  It's a whole lot of harmless fun along the way, too.
The plotline centers around the age-old problem of the straying husband.  In this case, however, the fellow does not have a pre-meditated inclination to cheat on his wife.  Rather, he picks up a stranded motorist (who somehow ends up being a courtesan) and gets caught by what seems to be an anti-prostitute SWAT team.  And, his luck seems to go from bad to worse from there!
After his wife & her friends & her mother find out, the poor fellow begins his penance and all of the typical human rituals of attempting to get her to take him back.  Thanks to his two buddies, the whole situation is put in the most zany perspective imaginable!
The film is almost a real-time movie as 90% of it takes place in a bar.  One would think that the one-setting-framework would tend to get tedious, but there are enough twists & turns in the storyline to keep the viewer interested.
As is so often the case these days, you get the typical plain Jane knockout (capably played by Kimberly Williams).  However, I could tell from the get-go that she was no plain Jane, no matter how much they tried to make her look like a geek.
If you want a light-hearted look at the serious issue of infidelity, this one would appear to be a clear-cut winner.  Or, if you're simply in the market for another Romantic Comedy & good fun, you can do a whole lot worse than a little harmless sex.",1081641600,2,1597,4.404761904761905
7891674,4,6305556148,"I watched this movie the other night and out of 4 that I had rented over the weekend (Whatever, the Dead Zone and War Zone) this one is the one that I enjoyed the most (with Whatever being a worthy second).  I just really enjoyed the cast (all very eclectic unknowns) and the storyline, which was lighthearted and funny.  I rented it having never heard of it before, but went with the ""two thumbs up"" stamp of approval that I generally agree with and this was no exception!  I don't know if I'd give it a 5 star, but it's certainly better than average and better than most of the [types] that comes out these days.",996537600,2,614,4.275862068965517
