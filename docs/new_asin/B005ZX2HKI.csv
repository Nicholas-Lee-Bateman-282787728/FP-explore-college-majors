8490025,5,B005ZX2HKI,a really good look of. Joe's style....he is a master,1427068800,,52,4.3
8490026,2,B005ZX2HKI,"It might be a really good guide, I don't know.
I was misled to think that it was done by Joe Bonamassa.
It was supposed to be a gift for a friend.",1424217600,,146,3.59375
8490027,3,B005ZX2HKI,wasn't what I was expecting.,1408060800,,28,4.8
8490028,5,B005ZX2HKI,I bought this for my grandson and he just loves it. It was a great gift for him. Glad I got it for him.,1398816000,,103,3.3333333333333335
8490029,5,B005ZX2HKI,"Great stuff, very well explained.
The instructor goes about explaining every phrase in detail making the learning easy.
The lessons are straight forward and not diluted and extended with theory.
But still, if you want to know the reasons, scales and all the theory behind each solo, there's a special chapter for it.",1369612800,4,316,4.981132075471698
8490030,5,B005ZX2HKI,some great leads in the style of Joe Bonammasa. Danny Gill is a fantastic player and teacher.always good stuff from Danny.,1362355200,3,122,4.857142857142857
8490031,1,B005ZX2HKI,I felt the style was more like the instructor Danny Gill than Joe Bonamassa's style. Lick Library's Peter Green dvd was more in the style of the original artist. I have been disappointed in a couple of the Quick Lick dvds for the same reason.,1353974400,6,242,4.4
