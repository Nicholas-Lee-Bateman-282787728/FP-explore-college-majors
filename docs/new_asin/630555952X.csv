1051856,5,630555952X,"Although Legend of the Crystal Coconut is the title of this movie, it's actually the title of only one of the episodes on the tape. There are several others present, but titles aren't shown. Anyways, these are some great selections of episodes. My favorite on this tape would be Ape-Nesia. The computer animation is very fitting to the DKC style, and the voices fit the characters nicely. Only one problem: in ape-nesia, they flash back to an episode that we didn't see yet; that episode comes later in the tape. SO one small error in the order of the episodes, otherwise a great video.",994377600,,586,4.644230769230769
1051857,5,630555952X,"This video was one I suggest to all.  Though most people look at it and thinks its nothing more than a kids video, I think people of all ages will enjoy it.  The movie shows you some of the adventures of Donkey Kong and  his friends.  It's fun and full of surprise as he battles to keep the  crystal coconut in his possession.  The video is full of fun songs that  you'll be singing long after you see it.  It's very hard for me to find a  movie that I can watch all the way through without wanting to wander around  during it, or watch something else, but this is one of the few that I don't  want to turn off.  I suggest this video to all.  I loved it and I know you  will too.",947289600,13,679,3.8970588235294117
1051915,5,630555952X,"This movie is truly amazing. It is easily the greatest one of all time. This is a movie that has amazing animation, very catchy songs, and genius. You'd have to be moron NOT to watch this movie. Ha Ha Ha LOL Just Kidding! Ha Ha! But seriously though... WATCH IT!
Peace Out!

1051916,5,630555952X,"I'm a very big fan of Donkey Kong, that's why I bought the Donkey Kong Tape. It is a warm feeling to the family when they watch it. In the video game of Donkey Kong, he and his crew seems like stupid apes just destroying bad guys. This program is not like that. The Donkey Kong Country tv series is like if they were created to have fun watching them. The characters were funny. I know all the characters in the program. For some one like my age, it is a warm feeling inside. I wish that Donkey Kong Country tv series were more famous today. Cartoon Television shows today have alot of violence. In this program, its not like that. I wish that Donkey Kong has more on tape episodes.",1118102400,3,682,4.213740458015267
1051917,5,630555952X,"From the terrible voices to the awful music this is a masterpiece of trash cinema.  As a firm believe in there's no such thing as something so bad it's acctually entertaining I was shaken and shocked by this video, it makes me laugh every time I watch it.  The awkward stories jumbled together along with completely botched segways into musical numbers just make me and friends crack up every time.  I can't recomend this puppy enough!  It's so poor and so inane that you can't help but laugh and wonder how it got any funding.  It could be seen as an insult to Miyamoto, but it's just so bad that you can't take it seriously.",1061596800,8,626,4.408695652173913
1051918,4,630555952X,"My son age 7 would rate this movie 5 stars, but his sisters  (ages 4 and 9) don't agree.  He has watched it 5 times, then tired of it.  For the girls, it was once each.  For me and mom once was definitely enough.  So.  There you have a qualified 4 star rating depending on your age and gender. Try any of the land Before time movies especially the first three or the brave little toaster if you looking for alternatives to disney.",1053993600,,430,4.120481927710843

7892092,1,630555952X,"Ok. Let's not get too bogged down in the preliminary issues of this movie. For example: the humor is terrible. That can be stipulated from the beginning. Secondarily, computer graphics DK looks terrifying. If one pauses this movie at any point and looks into his eyes, there is nothing but a savage wantonness, a horrifying culmination of boredom and apathy seen in the eyes of many young men in our times, the look that they are capable of facilitating the most extreme atrocities just to see what happens. Lastly, the story makes no sense. The crystal coconut belonged to a pirate long ago, and now it is suddenly DK's birthright? Is it a cultural misappropriation? Are the monkeys like the ewoks worshiping C-3PO because he seems magical? Why do they even want DK to be the leader? Have they not looked into his eyes? Do they not know that he would rule with an iron fist, and that his reign will be marked with bloodletting and orgiastic excess unlike anything from the days of Caligula? The movie addresses none of these fundamental questions. As stated before, however, these quibbles are just the beginning.

The real problem dwells with the catastrophic scientific inaccuracies. I'm not referring to the monkeys talking, although that is a huge problem and is glazed over without a rational explanation. Firstly, Diddy Kong is a spider monkey (Don't even pull that chimpanzee BS, he has a prehensile tail) and DK is a mountain gorilla. You may ask: ""What's the problem with that?"" Big problem. Mountain gorillas are old world monkeys, and spider monkeys are new world monkeys. They do not live on the same continent or exist within the same ecosystem. Once again, this anomalous circumstance is simply glazed over. In a time when American children are already so behind in science, is it really helpful to disseminate this kind of misinformation? Another scientific issue is Cranky's apparent ability to astrally project an image of himself. The mechanism is never explained. Ok, there are monkeys that can talk, but are we expected to just go along with talking monkeys also capable of projecting their image across space without any form of technology? The movie has gone too far and loses all credibility at this point.

In conclusion, this movie is a nightmarish fever-dream of scientific inaccuracy and unexplained circumstances. I lost sleep trying to make sense of it, I was haunted by the implications, and I cannot recommend it for that reason. I strongly suspect that the communists made this movie as a brainwashing propaganda film. That's the only explanation that makes any sense.",1430092800,5,2601,4.949656750572083

7892095,5,630555952X,"I ordered this for my friend one day as we were telling each other stories of our childhood, he told he used to always rent this from the Blockbuster. I figured what the hell, and ordered it. It came a few days later is perfect condition everything worked fine. I gave it to my friend and he loved it.

7892096,4,630555952X,Ok so the truth is this movie is really bad. I got it as a joke for my brother because we played donkey Kong  from the ages of 4 to 13 and still do some days. (he is now 19) We are both big donkey Kong fans so we got a kick out of this. But if you not a huge donkey Kong fan. or buying this for a joke. I don't think you will like it some parts (the singing) are hard to watch,1297555200,2,376,3.4235294117647057
