2583259,5,B000FS9FGM,"I had the pleasure of watching a couple of movies from this set last night and let me just say, I must be blessed. Ironbound Vampire is... phenomenal. Its plot was intricate, its characters were well developed, and the cinematography only would have been better had Dion Beebe (of Memoirs Of A Geisha fame) shot it. There were NO plot holes. Everything made sense, I swear.

If I had six thumbs, they would all go up in honor of this masterpiece.",1175385600,5,446,4.506172839506172
2583260,1,B000FS9FGM,"Do not buy this item if you have any appreciation for video transfer.  On many of the movies the sound and video quality is terrible.

On several movies it looks like someone made the video transfer from videotaping the movies while watching them on television.

Don't make the mistake I made.  In hindsight, I would only purchase this collection if I found it in a dollar bin sale, which is most likely where these Mill Creek collections will be in a year or so.",1171065600,8,463,4.476190476190476
2583261,4,B000FS9FGM,This is for people who really like the classic old style horror and thriller movies.  I think the collection is very good and worth the cost. It would be very hard to acquire all of these seperatley.  Great for rainy nights!,1168819200,5,224,4.439024390243903
2583262,5,B000FS9FGM,Great price! Great movies! Nothing 'Gone With The Wind'-ish or any of the modern so-called classic movies of today - but I didn't want anything from today. Sometimes I'm just in the mood for something innocent and fun. This hits the spot!,1168041600,4,238,4.690476190476191

I would like to know if this mega-pack contains subtitles (in english or spanish) in every movie of the pack or a part of them.

2583264,5,B000FS9FGM,"TALES OF TERROR is another great collection of public domain horror movies! No, these are not digitally remastered, spotless masterpieces. These are movies that are available to any company (and there are tons of them) that wants to put them out. So, why pay 10-20 times as much for the same scratchy movies?? Here's the run-down: THE WHITE GORILLA- An hour-long stinkfest about a guy in a white go-rilla suit in the jungle. Actually 2 movies spliced together! Pretty dull indeed! THE LONG HAIR OF DEATH- Barbera Steele is a vengeful ghost, out to fulfill her mother's curse. Good spooker! THE NIGHT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE- Horribly editted pile of offal! Barely makes sense, and Erica Blanc's infamous naked coffin dance is gone! Ugh! CONDEMNED TO LIVE- Ralph Morgan is a guy doomed to suck the life from others. A good flick! THE HEAD- Awesome german mad science spectacular about a psychotic doctor and his keeping a disembodied head alive! includes a Hunchback, strippers, and lots of bubbling chemicals! DEVIL MONSTER- Ridiculous tale of a giant man-eating manta ray on the loose. Junk! CRYPT OF THE LIVING DEAD- Andrew Prine stars as a man who must battle the queen of the vampires to help solve his father's murder. Not bad. CHLOE, LOVE IS CALLING YOU- Absolutely stoooopid story about a voodoo lady and her attempts to stop a romance. THE PHANTOM OF SOHO- German murder mystery w/ a golden-gloved killer! Watch for the topless dancers and wacky prostitutes! THE APE MAN- Bela stars as a man who becomes part ape and sleeps w/ his go-rilla buddy! They also go on a killing spree together! Ok. THE SADIST- The only decent thing Arch Hall jr. ever did! He plays his serial-killing scumbag character like no other! A classic! A WALKING NIGHTMARE- Sorry, I fell asleep! A dark-house type mystery. NIGHT FRIGHT- John Agar is the sheriff of a small town full of 30+ year old college ""kids"", who are plagued by a mutated space monkey! No, I'm serious! Good for laughs. SCARED TO DEATH- Bela and George Zucco star in this godawful piece of doggy-do about a dead woman and her telling of her traumatic life. At least there's a midget! SOUND OF HORROR- Treasure hunters encounter an invisible beasty in a cave, saving a fortune on special effects! Watch for Ingrid Pitt's little dance number! Ok. THE MAN W/ TWO LIVES- A rich guy dies and switches souls w/ an executed murderer. Pretty good! THE IRONBOUND VAMPIRE- A hippie-vampire haunts New Jersey. Shot on video tape ultra-cheapie w/ very little to offer. I did like the vampiric gal-pal stuff near the end though! Yowza!! HANDS OF STEEL- Terminator rip-off w/ a silly android stalked by John Saxon. Includes arm-wrestling truckers and dryer-duct hoses on car roofs! Also has a 3-second topless sequence! VAMPIRE'S NIGHT ORGY- A bus breaks down in vampiretown! Loads of bloodsuckers and cannibalism to boot! Good-O! ONE FRIGHTENED NIGHT- An old guy wills his fortune to his missing granddaughter. The other relatives are NOT pleased, especially when she just happens to reappear! Ok. THE WEREWOLF OF WASHINGTON- Dean Stockwell gets hairy after a trip to Transylvania. Trouble is, he works for the president of the united states! An ok political satire. A STRANGE ADVENTURE- A young hot rod enthusiast gets mixed up w/ bank-robbers. Marla English (She Creature) is a very bad girl! THE ISLAND MONSTER- Boris Karloff is a kindly old doctor who is also a sadistic drug smuggler! Good. THE ROGUES TAVERN- Wallace Ford tries to help solve a string of murders commited by someone wearing a dog-head puppet on their hand! No kidding! Ok. TERROR CREATURES FROM THE GRAVE- barbera steele inhabits a castle built on a burial-ground for plague victims. Ickiness ensues! Watch for the zombified / mummified, severed hands! THE CABINET OF DOCTOR CALIGARI- Silent classic about a string of murders that occur when a strange hypnotist and his somnambulist come to town! Excellent! EVIL BRAIN FROM OUTER SPACE- Mutants are attacking and only Starman can save us! Lots of kung-fu disco dancing! THE DEVIL BAT- Bela is a mad scientist who creates a giant bat that kills those who wear a certain shaving lotion! Good. THE BAT- Silent crime drama about the notorious BAT and his reign of terror. Very good. Watch for the early influences on Batman, years before the caped-crusader was even thought of! THE AMAZING TRANSPARENT MAN- An escaped convict is recruited by an evil army major who wants him to become transparent in order to steal nuclear material. Why? He wants to make an invisible army of course! Good. THE PHANTOM CREEPS- Bela is the nefarious Dr. Zorca, out to conquer the world in this condensed version of the 12-part serial. I actually like this better, short and sweet! CRIMES AT THE DARK HOUSE- Tod Slaughter is at his devilish best causing murder and mayhem, all while chuckling demonically! Great! THE SHE-BEAST- Barbera Steele is a young woman who disappears in a lake, only to be replaced by a centuries-old witch. You'll never forget her shriek! Ok. THE GHOST WALKS- Another old dark house type movie. Ok. CURSE OF THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN- A movie by hippies, for hippies, about hippies being killed by the title character. Or are they? Who cares?! It's a dreadful mess! THE CRIMES OF STEPHEN HAWKE- Tod Slaughter again! This time he's a kindly moneylender who also happens to be an evil serial-killer called the spinebreaker! Many deaths! Great! DEVIL'S PARTNER- Ed Nelson is an old man who makes a sacrifice to satan so he can come back from the dead. Creepy and watchable. SHOCK- Vincent Price is a wife-murdering psychiatrist who is witnessed by a woman. The witness goes into shock and ends up under the good doctor's care! Good. MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE- The absolute nadir of all film-making, yet this cinematic whale turd is addictively viewable! Who could forget Torgo or the Master? Or the whiney kid? Unbelievable! MURDER IN THE RED BARN- Tod Slaughter must kill off a poor gal in order to marry a rich lady. Can he pull it off? Good. THE MANSTER- A guy in japan is secretly given a serum that turns him into a murderous monster! Watch for the eyeball in the shoulder scene! NEVER TOO LATE- Tod Slaughter is a respectable squire who has an interesting hobby. He loves to work at the prison and torture the inmates, especially the feisty ones! Great! THE DEVIL'S MESSENGER- Lon Chaney jr. is the devil, introducing three minor tales of slight fear in this failed TV pilot. Boring, although the third story ain't bad. TEENAGE ZOMBIES- Jerry Warren's stale tale of teens on zombie island. Not his worst movie though. THE BOWERY AT MIDNIGHT- Bela is both a college professor, and a soup-kitchen operator who is also a crimelord! Very good! TORTURE SHIP- Lyle Talbot is on board this hokey hunk of horse poo. Scientific experiments on convicts gone awry! So-so at best. MIDNIGHT SHADOW- Horrid murder mystery w/ Amos and Andy-type ""comic"" relief. P.U.! THE DEVIL'S DAUGHTER- More boredom in the form of a movie! A woman from Harlem inherits a plantation in Jamaica. Oh no! Her voodoo-priestess sister is out to scare her away! Terrible! NIGHT OF THE BLOOD BEAST- Alien invades earth by impregnating a male astronaut w/ it's offspring. Ouch! TALES OF FRANKENSTEIN- Made-for-tv pilot for another doomed show. This one's good. Can Dr. Frankenstein help a dying man? Perhaps, but at what cost? Good. Well, that's it. I recommend buying this baby right now! Peace...",1153526400,149,7424,4.860299921073402

2583267,5,B000FS9FGM,"Tales of Terror is a collection of 50 scary movies that only have one thing in common:  they are all public domain and as such it is possible for them to be presented in highly affordable collections.  I paid $19.98 for my set and that comes down to about 40 cents per movie. The way that movie tickets cost nowadays, you really cannot complain about this collection.

An added bonus of this collection is the fact that many of these movies are not available on other public domain collections.

Anyways, here is how I rate the movies in Tales of Terror:

Great:

The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari

I have 5 of these sets Horror, Science Fiction, Chillers, Nightmare Worlds as well as Tales of Terror. I bought them to see some of the aforementioned movies at a reasonable price. Some of the films on these sets can be purchased in better versions but they are more expensive. If you like one or more of the movies here you can buy a better version later. Anyone expecting razor sharp images, perfect colour and high quality sound should look elsewhere - you get what you pay for with these sets. The quality varies from good to awful, but I've yet to find a title that was so bad, picture or sound wise, that it was unwatchable. So if you can live with imperfection these packs are worth a look - and, to be honest, anyone who pays this price for 50 movies and claims to be disappointed, deserves to be.",1176422400,42,1179,4.267857142857143

Of the three, Drive-In Classics is my favorite. At less than four bits a pop, you can't go wrong with these films. While image quality is not HD it is better than what I expected. With an infusion of 150 new movies into my film library I have more than enough to keep me busy for many long weekends.

I am ready for Mill Creek to release Tale of Horror II, Drive-In Classics II, and Chilling Classics II. Keep the bad movies coming, guys.",1176249600,8,614,4.581818181818182

The super thin (cheap) cardboard box almost crumples in your hands - I can't believe it ever made it out of the testing stage. What GARBAGE! And I haven't even gotten to the quality of the films yet. No wonder everything is going to the CLOUD. My one star review is for the poorly designed packaging only. It's like the 3 stooges designed the stupid box.,1470700800,,409,4.466666666666667

My favorites here include 'The Sadist'(1963), 'Crimes at the Dark House'(1940), 'The Long Hair of Death'(1964), and 'The Head'(1959). Picture quality isn't that great but that adds to the creepy factor in my opinion.

Hey! This is before they had dolby, hi-fi and all that! I assume most of the negative reviews come from younger folks who were raised on HD TV! I haven't had any problem listening or watching any of these movies! Sure there are a few places where there might have been a film splice, or the sound may be less than 2015 standards, but it's nothing that's really going to bother anyone except for the spoiled younger generation!

Most of the 50-packs are bad prints of justly forgotten movies, but the old horror selections include so much stuff that in its own way is regarded as classic even if schlocky classic. I was able to revisit a lot of stuff not seen since I was kid staying up late on Friday night for Horror Theater, plus a lot of old stuff I knew only from stills in Famous Monsters of Filmland. Just a lot of joy. If assessed for quality of prints and artistic merits of the films it might have to be a very low rating, but for joy, I got plenty out of this.

And fact is, some of these really don't have better preserved copies anywhere, and you could buy ten of them separately and get pretty much the same scratchy print paying more than you did to get 50 here. So look through the list and see if not too many are on the other 50-packs you may already have. If not too much is duplicated, get this one too.",1394496000,,968,4.094736842105263

8125988,2,B000FS9FGM,"I have purchased other 50Packs including Nightmare Worlds and Chillers and enjoyed quite a few movies from each of those sets. This set, however, the Terror 50Pack had at best a very few movies which I would ever want to watch again. Most I would never want to watch once!

It seems too that more of the movies on this set from MillCreek are older and I personally find more of the 50's and 60's movies, maybe 70's, to my liking. The movies from the 30's and 40's usually are a little too old for my taste. At $15 or so a set, you do not have much to lose with these 50Packs but I would not recommend this selection.",1239494400,,616,4.133333333333334
8125989,4,B000FS9FGM,"This collection has terror/""horror"" films dating from the 1930's B&W up to 1980's. I use the term ""horror"" loosely here because some of the horror may be simply the appearance of a guy in a rubber suit for a few seconds or some shadowed figure commiting horrible acts behind drapery. However, if you have not seen samples of horror/terror movies of the early days of cinema, I would highly recommend this boxed-set; especially at the low price here. There are some notable actors such as Bela Lugosi and Todd Slaughter (from days of old) that appear in more than one of the films. The older films seem to move quickly. The Sadist will make your skin crawl despite it's black and white, 1950's feel. There are also some Giallo films in this set (the Night Evelyn... and some Barbara Steele in Europe flicks), but no modern slashers like Friday the 13th or Elm Street.
Definitely worth buying and watching if you have seen alot of new stuff and are hungry for some a slice of terror from the past.",1224633600,2,995,4.564245810055866
8125990,5,B000FS9FGM,"I bought this the other day at a Half Price Books.  I don't know if they have this store outside of the Pittsburgh area, but its great.  Anyhow, I already own a couple of these collection, the first being the ""Chilling"" one.  I should have gotten this one first.  Why?  The movies on this collection are the best!  Most of these are from the thirties through the fifties, with only a couple from the seventies! Also, a few of these films are silent, and I love the silent age.

I'm a big B Movie buff, but my taste seems to wan in the seventies, with the exception of just a few titles.  This collection was much more in line with the type of B Films that I look for.  Oh! There's a good Japanese flick in here too!

If you're debating between this and the ""Chilling"" collection, get this. That is, unless you prefer the seventies and eigthies style of B Film.",1214697600,5,860,4.253086419753086
