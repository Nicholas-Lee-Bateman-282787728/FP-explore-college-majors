6791660,5,B00PB1M2PY,"I love the  DVDs. The music too is up my street and the two ladies featured are delightful. One lady does exercises sitting on a chair and another lady exercises standing for the more adventurous. What is more the ladies are so friendly, you feel as though they are talking just to you. These are very nice exercise DVDs for the young at heart. Big band music as well. What a joy.",1475452800,12,380,4.277777777777778
6791661,5,B00PB1M2PY,I have used these before at an exercise class. I have arthritis and these exercises are easy on the joints.,1462665600,12,107,4.4

6791667,5,B00PB1M2PY,I have liked this DVD more and more as I do it....I have been using it at least 3 times a week.  The ladies have great personalities and the workout is not too much of a challenge for me with my COPD.  Don't get me wrong....I feel like I get a good workout!,1488758400,3,257,3.830188679245283
6791668,4,B00PB1M2PY,"If you are a senior and/or just starting exercise, this is a very good video.  The presenters and their exercises are great for a wide range of movement.  The beginning workout (on the first disc) is all accomplished sitting down and would be really wonderful for people recovering from surgery, or otherwise unable to move around a lot.  On the second disc, there are two workouts.  The strength workout is also very good, but very little is done standing.  Only aggravating feature:  the presenters spend so much time describing the exercises and detailing why they work, you get tired of standing there waiting for each exercise to begin.  The cardio portion is a lot of fun--dance routines, all standing , but not very long, and moving fast so it is hard to keep up with some of the steps.  It ends with balance work which is important.  The only issue with disc 2:  there is no menu and it just starts running the strength portion.  You cannot skip past it--you must fast forward through it.",1487203200,10,996,4.634285714285714
6791669,5,B00PB1M2PY,Wonderful exercising DVD!,1487116800,,25,7.666666666666667
6791670,4,B00PB1M2PY,"would like it more if we could fast forward the talk at the start, once you have heard it there is no need to have to listen to it every time you play the dvd. I fast forward but would prefer not to have to do that. At the start there should be a choice to play the dvd without the explanation. Otherwise the exercises are very good for seniors.",1485648000,7,345,3.942857142857143
6791671,5,B00PB1M2PY,I love these goovie gals. Very positive and encouraging. I plan to purchase another for my mother-in-law.,1483228800,4,105,5.235294117647059

6791673,5,B00PB1M2PY,"I'm not only 72 but, slightly crippled and this is absolutely perfect for me. All seniors should buy this DVD set. I can us both DVD's and my husband is
very proud of how good I'm able to get around now thanks to you two for making these 2 DVD's they have changed my life for the better.

8687234,5,B00PB1M2PY,I work with seniors. The choices on this dvd are incredible. Twice a week we use the sitting program for strength & balance and once a week we use the walking program which is standing and moving. Great purchase.,1496793600,4,212,4.461538461538462

8687236,1,B00PB1M2PY,"Too much sitting, not my kind of exercise since I am a very active senior. This is probably good for older folks who are just starting an exercise regimen. The only reason I got this was I did enjoy a zumba DVD with Joy in it.",1494633600,,226,3.9347826086956523
