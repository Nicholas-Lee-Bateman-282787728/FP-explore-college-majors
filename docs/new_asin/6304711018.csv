7876382,5,6304711018,"Will Millar was the lead singer of The Irish Rovers for many years. This new band of Musicians that joins Will on this tape blend perfectly with Will. This concert had some popular Irish tunes as well as ones I had never heard before..Will also shares a few stories as well as doing some sing-along songs. Whether you're  Irish or not,this concert is fun for the whole family. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !",1471996800,,402,4.583333333333333
