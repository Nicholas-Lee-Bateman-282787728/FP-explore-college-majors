1400827,5,B000056WR0,"Very funny Nee York City comedy with plenty of street scenes and subway scenes of the 1970's!  Even if you are lukewarm on Streisand's style of humor and rattattat tat way of talking, the situations presented are themselves funny.

Also interesting if one likes to play sociologist through old movies, this 42-year-old film shows the interesting fact that a married woman should not have to work.  Although the two protagonists, ""Henrietta"" (Barbara Streisand) and her husband are broke, they are a happy go lucky couple with their own airy and spacious apartment in Manhattan with a Negro maid once a week.

The man is supposed to earn enough for both, although they married too young and he never had completed his college degree in Landscaping (I love how his successful brother calls it ""majoring in Fertilizer"").  So he is forced to driving a cab.  What does wifey Henry do all day?  Apparently nothing.  So it is money that will force the issue of how to get hubby to finish that degree faster and secure a middle class salary. He is already 32, but as their bank loan manager frowns to say, it is a dangerous age for a man!  Many commit suicid if they can't get a loan!  No!  The risk is too high becuase a widow can't be forced to repay the loan!  I love the logic.  Absolutely correct, if one considers that a wife cannot or will Not work and therefore cannot be held liable for debts!

I was a high school teen in these mid seventies.  I do recall well that girls did not consider so much preparing for any kind of work or profession as to get married.  Yet if one considers today, marriage does not mean the end of work for a woman if she marries.  The majority are still employed married or not.  It is an economic necessity.

We are presented with an classic counter example in the form of hubby's brother, a successful television sales executive who cannot fix a TV.  He is shown with obnoxious wife in a fur coat and a big house and lawn far in the suburbs.  The two come to visit their poor relations once a year, to have a pot roast dinner (which the taxi driver can ill afford), wherein the two sisters-in-law have at it on the marriage and money questions.

The rich b&&&& suburban blames Henrietta for her brother in law not finishing college because Henrietta supposedly forced him into a young early marriage.  If he is already thirty-two, I wonder how old should he be then, to get married and have kids?  Wasn't that already a bit older?  This dinner table argument is an interesting one for young women to hear.  All assumptions are based on the husband's obligation to pay all the bills and never expect a wife to pay or work.

When Henrietta later that night suggests that she get her own job, he forbids it!  Can you imagine that nowadays?  It would be normal that a smart Jewish New York woman would already be a lawyer or well paid manager!
Thus in 1974 Our dear Barbara decides to ask advice from the black janitor about where to get money so she can invest in pork belly futures.  Absurd!  He suggests a day job at home when the hubby is out for a certain Madam.

And the troubles and insanities begin!  I did enjoy the improbable messes she got herself into, including riding the subway with a German Shephard after her in big boots and a blonde fluffy wig.  Riding a Brahman bull through downtown Manhattan was hilarious and affords a great view of the cars of the time and the clothing and hair and shoe fashions I do remember from back then.
None of these old low budget films are meant to be educational or enlightening and yet in their sheer audacity and stupidity, they show us a slice of life from that time and place, with all the now-strange underlying assumptions about men and women.

So yes I rank this movie as worth your time!  Good slapstick laughs, good dialogue and arguments, lousy loser husband and smart unemployed wife, streets and cars andnclothes and hairstyles, New York city in the OPEC recession and people feeling the pinch!  Racially the mix seems to be mainly American blacks and European-Americans.  Asians and Latinos don't seem to get into the camera.  A different world today!  Men wore trench coats and women wear dresses and bell bottom pants!  Women still sewed!

Sure this review may seem nutty, but those of you my age and above will know whereof I speak.",1465344000,,4326,4.521907216494846

 Estelle Parson's has a small role in the film and Barbra, as ever, is funny and wonderful.

1400918,2,B000056WR0,"For such a little movie, there's so much to say. Warning to Barbraphiles: Much of it won't be complimentary!

I wanted to like this movie when it originally came out. But I remember being somewhat appalled that this was what Streisand chose to follow on the heels of her much-overhyped dramatic success in ""The Way We Were.""

Like many, I asked myself ""What was she thinking???"" But then we must consider that she is doing Jon Peters at this point in her life, believing his lines and taking his advice (ouch!) Case in point: it is well known that Peters told Streisand during their initial meeting that she had a ""great ass."" She allegedly liked that her treated her as a woman instead of ""some famous thing."" Understandable. But the ass we see in this movie should NEVER have been permitted to be shoehorned into the very unattractive and high-waisted jeans she wears in several scenes. She's always needed to choose styles that diminish her dreadful spare tire. And although she does manage to look cute here, her dumpiness isn't all that well hidden.

The goal here was to continue the updating of her youthful ""hip"" image, which began with ""Owl & the Pussycat"" and some soft-rock-themed Streisand albums of the era. Toward this end she is shown high-fiving and sassing ""the help,"" popping a fake wheelie on a motorcycle, and she goes braless in a few scenes. But she's no hottie, sorry. And if she is going to call her nasty sister-in-law Helen a ""fat ass grizzly bear"" then she should make sure she doesn't have the bigger ass, WHICH SHE DOES and which we can see she does after several full body shots of Helen's very trim and attractive figure. Strike one.

""For Pete's Sake"" probably would have been a better movie with anyone else in the lead besides Streisand. She can't really be called a comedienne, and this is supposed to be a comedy along the same lines as ""What's Up Doc?"" (The ending with the cow-chase is, in fact, a blatant rip-off of ""Doc."") While Streisand can certainly perform shtick, it's always obvious that she takes herself SO SERIOUSLY that she undermines her own attempts to be funny. Her little-girl act, which we are treated to in one form or another in virtually all of her pictures, and which never fails to encourage sour stomachs, is never believable and grows tiresome quickly. And her whining and fake screams do tend to get on one's nerves, such as when she is running after the Brahma bull late in the film. (Notice this is the same street she runs across at the opening of ""The Way We Were."") Strike two.

Fortunately, Streisand has ample help to make her presence more palatable. The direction is smooth and well paced, as is the editing, although there is a clumsy chop at the end between the jail scene and the scene with Henry, her bags packed, preparing to leave  the apartment. The underscoring is exceptionally well done and gains power from its subtlety. The art direction is excellent, although you never quite believe that this is a young couple struggling financially. Not with the spacious and gorgeously furnished apartment with windows in EVERY room (including a stained-glass one in the bathtub!) and the black maid, Loretta!

Speaking of which, the supporting cast deserves raves, as is usually the case in a Streisand film. Estelle Parsons steals the show as Helen, and there should have been much more for her to do, but it's no secret that Barbra doesn't like to share the spotlight with another capable female. Molly Picon as Mrs. Cherry is a downright hoot. Michael Sarrazin tries, and he's certainly likeable, but Barbra ""devours"" him in almost every scene they share together, unfortunately. He does a sensational and oh-so-moving speech as he slips a ring on Henry's finger at the end which will surely tug at your heartstrings. So beautifully is it done that you really believe Pete and Henry are veryvery much in love and it is this one scene that is probably the highlight of the entire film. Alas, it is immediately followed by a shot emphasizing Barbra's nails, so we are once again taken OUT of the movie and into Barbra's private world, wondering how much she pays for a manicure. Strike three.

Back to the supporting cast of professionals. The various bankers, insurance and telephone company reps all do a masterful job, and raise the entertainment quotient substantially, although I'm not sure I quite appreciate the crack Streisand makes to the effeminate supermarket cashier early in the film when she tells him off, saying ""You take the Froot Loops, you'll love 'em."" Sure sounds like an anti-gay slur to me! If so, and what else COULD it be, it's revealing of how out-of-touch Barbra was then with the very people who raised her to prominence as an entertainer. Either she didn't know who made up her fan base, which is hardly possible given she started singing in a gay bar, or she was hell-bent on alienating those very people and distancing herself from them. Didn't work, did it.

Neither does this movie for the most part, which is unfortunate. And it's all because it's Barbra very obviously trying to control our perceptions of her, rather than portraying a character in a film. It's Barbra being Barbra, showing the world only what she wants them to see of Barbra, Barbra, Barbra. OY! It's embarrassing in a way to have to witness someone who is so in denial. I mean, we know by the very fact of her vehement insistences that she is- or is not- a certain way that the exact opposite has to be true. Why else go to such lengths to convince us? She wants us to THINK she's hot, mod, hep, cool, lithe, slinky, far-out, sexy, desirable and relaxed here. Because she KNOWS that in reality she's uptight, gawky, unyielding, inflexible, tight, unfriendly and uncomfortable.

Just look at those nails!!!!! They are at their longest EVER here, I think. She's like a CREATURE, with 8-inch long fingers! But she THINKS she's appealing and alluring and graceful. Well I certainly can see for myself that she is attractive, but I don't know any men who would want to get anywhere NEAR those nails. I mean, poor Jon Peters must have had nightmares about becoming the first John Bobbitt. He must have had scratches and scars all over his schwantz. Yikes! It's easy to imagine that those very nails might have easily been the inspiration for the Freddy Krueger character in the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies. In fact, Freddy would have been jealous because THESE nails don't rust!

The DVD packaging is cheap and the presentation is bare-bones, with funky/crappy art on the box, bland silent menus and the requisite lack of special features common to most Streisand releases. Disappointing indeed. There is a rather sparse commentary track by director Peter Yates, who is affable enough but whose memory of the filming seems rather vague, so he doesn't shed much light on anything. The so-called ""Talent Files"" offer the briefest of bios. Yet ANOTHER dreary and boring listing of all the meaningless awards Barbra has won is foisted upon viewers who have the misfortune of navigating to this section of the disc. I know of no other celebrity who insists that their every introduction, verbally or in-print, be preceded by a detailed listing of every award he or she has ever won in the course of their careers. Why does Barbra do this????????

The title song, quite pleasingly melodic, is also kinda cheesey due to its lyrics, which are a trifle trite. (How's THAT for alliteration?) You don't really wonder why Streisand never released it as a single, never acknowledged it in her later years, or included it on any of the multitudinous compilations she has issued. Even the die-hard fans have somehow managed to refrain from clamoring for this one. Her throw-away vocal, like her throw-away portrayal of Henry, leaves the audience with a faint whiff of trashy production. We expected better because we were led to expect better. So?

I can't finish this review without mentioning ""The Wig."" The look is undeniably cute. But a wig is a wig is a wig, and this one looks like. . . a wig. Some camera angles show it off more than others, and we see it from behind quite a bit, but still. . .The shame is this would have been a perfectly fetching hairstyle had she actually gone and got her real locks trimmed. And it would have saved the rest of us from having to look at that red poodle-do she sported later, in ""A Star is Born"" and ""Main Event."" (UGH.) But again, she was under that haircutter's ""mojo."" (Speaking of big asses.)

""For Pete's Sake,"" like most Streisand films, is watchable and even enjoyable at times, but not for the reasons you'd expect. Because this was a Streisand film. And for all she was touted to be able to deliver, she's one of the film's lesser assets.

In retrospect we see that she really wasn't all THAT special after all.",1321315200,4,8827,4.722727272727273

1400950,2,B000056WR0,"In retrospect, it isn't hard to understand why Barbra chose to make this limp, embarrassingly unfunny farce.  The arty UP THE SANDBOX had just flopped and the future prospects of the just completed THE WAY WE WERE were unknown.  Deciding that her reputation as a movie superstar couldn't take another project that was a commercial risk, she agreed to star in FOR PETE'S SAKE, a woefully misguided attempt at modern screwball comedy.  Basically, everything that WHAT'S UP, DOC? succeeded at brilliantly, FOR PETE'S SAKE fails at miserably.  Not only are the characters annoying and the puns infantile, but FOR PETE'S SAKE commits the biggest crime known to comedy:  it just ain't funny.  Throughout all of the typical comedic mix-ups and chases, the viewer will find his or herself moaning rather than laughing.

Barbra tries her best to pump the film up with her undeniable comic gifts, but there's no inspiration in this sitcom-level script, so even her earnest portrayal gets lost amid the murk.  Michael Sarrazin fares even worse due to his badly underwritten character, and he has no chemistry with Streisand.  Unfortunately, the rest of the cast doesn't fare much better.  True, veteran comedic actress Molly Picon has a few amusing bits as Ms. Cherry, but none of the other supporting players are able to break out of their one-note characters.  However, when a screenplay is this labored and unfunny, you can't really blame any of the actors - they obviously did the best with what they were given.  It's certain that Barbra wouldn't have made this film had she known that THE WAY WE WERE was going to be a blockbuster hit, however that is not a good enough reason to excuse the poor execution behind this picture.

There are fans who like to say that the contrived box office hit THE MAIN EVENT or the off-beat box office flop ALL NIGHT LONG are Barbra's weakest films, but I must strongly disagree.  THE MAIN EVENT may have been tired and predictable, but at least it was funny overall, and Streisand did had chemistry with her leading man in that one.  And though ALL NIGHT LONG may have not been a perfect film (the film's soggy mid-section is it's biggest flaw), but it had a charmingly odd-ball perspective that made the movie seem bizarrely endearing.  FOR PETE'S SAKE has none of the things that make THE MAIN EVENT or ALL NIGHT LONG entertaining.  It just stumbles on to the finale, getting progressively worse as it goes.  While FOR PETE'S SAKE was actually a box office hit in it's day, in the end it no doubt had a more damaging effect on Barbra's career.  It did nothing but provide fodder for the people who never liked her to begin with.

About the DVD:  The picture quality is great, much better than I expected, and the sound is also fine.  Yates' commentary track isn't very interesting (and has some long silences), but it's still a nice addition.",1081123200,5,2873,4.75

So, she goes from one silly plotline to another to try and get him the money, all the while putting them further in debt.  Until the end when the porkbelly stock finally brings them their dreams.
AA sweet comedy with Barbra acting her face off trying her best to make the most of it.  I truly hate her short hair in this movie, it distracts me.  I hope that ""What's Up, Doc?""  and ""On a Clear Day"" get a great DVD treatment.  Enjoy!",1015891200,3,1045,4.605405405405405

1400955,4,B000056WR0,"It's nice to see more Barbra Streisand titles appearing on DVD.  FOR PETE'S SAKE has arrived and although it is not one of Streisand's ""classic"" films, it is certainly entertaining -- and the DVD makes this 1970's film look great!
For starters, the disk comes with a letterbox presentation on one side and a full-screen presentation on the other.  The menu is colorful and a funky 1970's design.  The trailers included (WAY WE WERE, PRINCE OF TIDES, and the PETE'S trailer) are interesting.  The Talent Files are brief.  The colors and clarity of the picture look great to me.
As for the film, Barbra is very funny.  She's in her fast-talking Brooklynese mode here.  The plot is barely realistic, but that doesn't really matter because this is a romantic, screwball comedy.  Actually, when you think about it, the story of a wife who prostitutes herself to pay for a loan is quite horrendous.  But director Peter Yates somehow makes you forget this -- in his commentary (an extra audio track on the disk) he keeps saying ""This movie is entertainment, it's supposed to be fun and not taken seriously.""
Barbra sings the title song (the lyrics are a bit dated, but the song is fun) and wears a short Jon Peters-designed wig.  Look for Barbra's longtime manager Marty Erlichman in a cameo. Also, praise should be given to Gene Callahan's production design.  Streisand's apartment (although clearly out of her character's means) is gorgeous!
My favorite scene is when Barbra gets licked by the bull while driving a trailer.  Barbra's laughs of disgust and amazement are quite hilarious.
Enjoy FOR PETE'S SAKE!",986515200,17,1604,4.878228782287823
1400956,2,B000056WR0,"""For Pete's Sake"" is a ""cute"" film at best and Streisand does have some funny moments (she's such a great film comedian! She needs to do more comedies!), however if you are looking at this DVD for the ""extras"" (theatrical trailers and director's commentary) skip it! If you are the type who loves to hear director's talk about why they selected this angle or that shot or how the film was actually made -- you know, what a director's commentary is supposed to be -- then you will be truly disappointed in this DVD. Peter Yates must have wonderful stories to tell, but I think he recorded this in his sleep. There is so much dead air -- too many missed opportunities to talk about making the film! Instead he focuses on Barbra's hair, Barbra's figure and -- of all things -- the size of the automobiles in the background of a shot ""It's amazing how big the cars were in those days... they really have got smaller. Thank God, because there wouldn't be much room on the road if they had stayed this size."" No, Mr. Yates, it's not amazing, it's boring. Unfortunately, his facts aren't accurate either  (refering to this film as Barbra's first non-singing role). Oh well. Also, the theatrical trailers are the same as the ones on ""The Way We Were"" DVD (including trailers for ""Way We Were"", ""For Pete's Sake"", ""Prince of Tides"" and ""Mirror Has Two Faces"").  If you want a light, funny film, check this out, but don't get ""For Pete's Sake"" for the DVD extras.",986428800,4,1453,4.520912547528517
1400957,5,B000056WR0,"I just love this movie. It's still funny after 25 years. The best part is when the Bull and Cows run right through the Movie screen during the Western,and Barbra's shouting,""Girls,come back here."" I love Mrs  Cherry,and Barbra's try at being one of her call girls. Not only is  Streisand one of the greatest singers will ever know,but a great comedian  as well. Along with""The Owl and the Pussycat,"" this is my  favorite Barbra Streisand comedy.",952041600,10,445,4.815789473684211
