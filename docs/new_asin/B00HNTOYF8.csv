8633861,5,B00HNTOYF8,My granddaughter was absolutely thrilled. She didn't know that Bella Sara had a full length movie.  She watches it a lot.  She is 9 years old and is crazy about horses.,1400284800,,168,4.387096774193548
8633862,2,B00HNTOYF8,"My daughter loves Bella Sara. She collects the cards and has read many of the books, so we were really looking forward to seeing this movie. To say that it was disappointing is an understatement. The animation is absolutely terrible...it looks like the graphics from a cheap video game from a decade ago. The voice actors are pretty bad as well. I would review the story, but my daughter wandered away from the tv after 20 minutes and I turned it off. I can't believe the Bella Sara people didn't put a little more effort and resources into this. Major fail.",1399852800,3,558,4.534653465346534
8633863,4,B00HNTOYF8,"I think 3 and 1/2 stars would probably be the most accurate rating, but Amazon doesn't do half stars, so I rounded up =)
  To begin, I should say that I am an adult who enjoys watching all types of horse films (even the animated ones), so when I saw this movie for sale on Amazon, I decided to give it a try, and was pleasantly surprised.
  Having seen two other Bella Sara DVD stories (""The Adventure Begins"" and ""The Lost Herds"") I was happy to see that they had opted for a fully animated feature this time instead of the usual narrated ""storybook"" format of the others. That said, the graphics were slightly disappointing. They seemed a bit unfinished and reminded me a little of the ""in-progress"" scenes seen in the special features of animated movies done by larger studios. I felt that they were one or two steps away from looking complete, and the characters' movements were a bit unnatural looking at times. Even so, I thought that the characters were cute (especially the horses).
  If you can get past the below par animation (I don't think most children would have a problem with that), the story is actually pretty cute and entertaining. Some things about it reminded me a little of the Barbie animated films. At only 75 minutes long, I do wish it were just a little bit longer, but the story seemed complete nevertheless.
  Another thing to mention is that, like previous Bella Sara releases, the story contains some mythological references (The main character is referred to as a Valkyrie and there is also a Dryad), but unlike the previous releases, Sara is not directly referred to as a ""goddess."" I was personally thankful for that as I was never a fan of the ""goddess"" idea. Sara does do some magical things in the film, but that fits right in with any fairytale.
  Overall, the story was nothing new, but it was a pleasant little tale and and enjoyable watch. I would watch it again, and I would be willing to watch future Bella Sara releases like this if they decide to make more.",1397088000,8,2001,4.548746518105849
