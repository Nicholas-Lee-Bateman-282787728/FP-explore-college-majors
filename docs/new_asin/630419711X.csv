7867351,5,630419711X,"This boxset is a must have for the diehard ""Flying Nun"" Fan.
I was very young when the series ended and missed the pilot and the salient episodes that make up the Flying Nun mystique.
I could not get enough from this boxset and the episodes of her Maiden Voyage and the second episode ""Fatal Hibiscus"" lend themseives to the charm and wonder of the entire series.
 Sally Field is obviously meant for this role and although the personal tribulations of the young star at the time contributed to the series end (She suffered from depression during the series,playing a nun when you yourself are bursting with energy is hard!!!).
I am glad that she managed to give our minds a diversion at a time when the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal were prevalent on our TV Screens.
 I will recommend this series to any Fan and wish that they bring out the whole series for purchase.",1021248000,14,875,4.531645569620253
