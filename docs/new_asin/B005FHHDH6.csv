4673775,2,B005FHHDH6,"I was very excited to get my DVD..being a semi beginner I thought the 21 days would build on each other. It is advertised FOR ANY LEVEL..I didn't feel that. There was NO introduction..no practice poses..the first DVD was 45 mins long.. There were advanced poses. She spoke too quickly and mumbled..The first DVD went right Into a routine..with no practice..no intro. It was very frustrating. There wasn't a woman next to her doing it for beginners as a comparison that a lot of fitness DVD's have . I felt I needed to keep up ..45 mins..your first time ..yikes! I know I will,probably ""grow into it"" but felt the ""for any level"" was misleading.",1357171200,19,644,4.608695652173913
4673776,3,B005FHHDH6,"There were some segments that were helpful. I enjoyed the 20-minute core focus and hip openers. I wasn't able to get anything from the 45-Minute Fun Flow and didn't find it at all fun. It was very difficult for me to follow. Even though a few of the sections were okay, this one just fell short for me. Just not my cup of tea.",1337299200,5,326,4.109375
4673777,4,B005FHHDH6,Great way to develop more yoga skills and practice!  I like how each one has a different purpose for your body.,1329177600,3,111,4.285714285714286
4673778,4,B005FHHDH6,"I love this dvd! I'm on day 5 and i notice that i feel more relaxed! its kind of like being in class! some of the sessions are a bit short (when you're used to having hour long classes, some of the 20 min sessions catch you off guard) but i think they are great! i would say that if you have never ever been to a yoga class, i would watch the dvd first and then begin your practice. i find that the instructors move through positions and, unlike a class, you don't have someone to help or wait for you. for those of you who want to have a cool dvd to use when you cant make it to class, i highly recommend this product!",1327968000,10,619,3.8818897637795278
4673779,4,B005FHHDH6,"I was looking for a yoga DVD that would have a variety of poses and be somewhat challenging. This series has enough variety to please those new to yoga and those that have been practicing for years. The set offers practices that are able to be worked into your daily life with ease. I have been very pleased and I can tell a difference in daily practice from my previous once or twice a week practice. The videos are very basic (no music, basic background), but the yoga and descriptions are great!",1327795200,9,498,4.423913043478261
4673780,5,B005FHHDH6,"I started my first day of this yoga 21 day challenge.  I've done a lot of yoga and especially yoga on video instruction.  This is by far one of the best I've done.  I really enjoyed it.  The shavasana could have been longer, but that wasn't too big of a deal for me because I can do that on my own.  Can't wait for the other twenty days of this video.  I have a feeling it's going to be a challenge which is always great.  I'm more of an intermediate student and this first one was not easy.  Great video!",1325203200,3,505,3.98
4673781,5,B005FHHDH6,"Exactly what I needed...a no brainer schedule, including meals to stick to for results.  So far I am very pleased with this set.",1318982400,3,128,4.565217391304348
4673782,5,B005FHHDH6,"I always thought I could be much better at yoga if only I practiced more often. I consider myself a beginning to intermediate yoga practitioner, and I've made a lot of excuses for not getting off my butt every day to get myself out of beginner territory. And then I started YJ's 21 Day Challenge, and I had no more excuses!

As expected, there is a different practice for each day, from a handful of very awesome teachers (especially Elise Lorimer, who talks you effortlessly through each pose). I appreciated the variety in the practices. Peaceful energizing morning sequences, core workouts, vinyasa flow, hip openers, and everything in between. Doing one practice a day forced me to try new poses and styles and open up my practice. Of course, I'm sure each of these practices would work very well on its own!

I'm so thrilled that YJ is releasing the challenge videos in a DVD version. I definitely recommend this for anyone looking for motivation to get up and do more yoga!",1318291200,27,979,4.686046511627907
8469891,4,B005FHHDH6,"Do not lose the insert for the 21-day plan. The poses are great, but this is a little too fast for the average beginner. I did enjoy the pose sequences and the ability to do different workouts each day. The color on my copy seemed a little faded from what I expected.",1459641600,,267,4.153846153846154
8469892,5,B005FHHDH6,Love how it progresses in difficulty as I progress in my yoga skills,1454976000,,68,4.3076923076923075
8469893,4,B005FHHDH6,Great for at home practice.,1405468800,,27,4.6
8469894,3,B005FHHDH6,"Overall the 21-day Challenge is good for beginners and intermediates alike as if offers something for both.  I would say however from an aesthetic point, the DVD is rather dull.  All poses are done indoors in a very sterile looking environment, white like a doctors office.  Having it done in a beautifully appointed room, or outdoors in a lovely natural setting would have made it come more alive.  Also, the instructors are  somewhat detached and a could have a little more ""bedside"" manner, though the instructions are fairly good.  I also prefer to have some soft back ground music.  There is no music.  Sometimes the microphone would have some interference on some of the sequences.  Additionally, it seemed to have a rather western feel to the approach of yoga and no information on how the poses can help you with being more connected to yourself and others.  I feel this is the essence of yoga and without it, it seems alot like a typical exercise class.  All that being said I like to use it because there are some fairly strenuous workouts that will definitely improve your practice even if you are an intermediate student.
Namaste!",1396828800,2,1142,4.775510204081633
8469895,2,B005FHHDH6,"This item didn't work on my laptop, which would have been good to know before I bought it. :/

I did manage to play it in my DVD player. The sequences are just ok: like with a lot of yoga journal videos, they largely skip warm up salutations and move right to the poses that require more flexibility, which makes it more difficult than it should be. Also the transitions are sort of awkward and require to you face away from the screen in some cases.",1393372800,,450,4.232558139534884
8469896,5,B005FHHDH6,"I loved this dvd because it gives me enough of a challenge when it comes to stretching out during my rest days in between running days. It's a perfect complement to my running and martial arts training schedule.

The instructions are given clearly and I found it easy to understand given that I've been going to yoga classes for 8 years now. I'm not sure how it would be for beginners who wouldn't understand what 'squaring of the hips' is and other poses.

Definitely not a cardio workout but perfect for those rest days in between high intensity days.",1391299200,,553,4.575757575757576
8469897,4,B005FHHDH6,"Nice sessions taught by nice teachers. I agree with the reviewers who said some of the workouts are way too short. On some days I felt I just warmed up and the session was already over! I had to do something else to release my extra energy and to feel happy & content. The Day 1 flow series may be a little bit difficult for beginners. The core workout is my least favorite since I don't feel my core (or anywhere) worked out after doing it. Maybe I simply didn't get the point of all the small, subtle and sometimes a little awkward movements. In my humble opinion, 100 sit-ups feel more effective and satisfying. :D

In general, it's a program worth trying. I would give it 3.5 stars.",1375833600,,686,4.317829457364341
8469898,3,B005FHHDH6,"This isn't really transforming my body as I hoped, I am a beginner but some of the sessions are really not doing anything for my body (and I am in good shape) and are way too short (15 minute transformation???).  It is nice that they are broken up smaller but I think it would be better to have at least 30 minutes a session.  I am on day 12, I feel good because yoga always makes me feel good, but I also have been supplementing this program with two or three other sessions elsewhere.  I will stick it out though, the price was not too bad and the instructors are pretty decent as well.  You might feel different than I do.",1373414400,,625,4.140495867768595
8469899,2,B005FHHDH6,I am used to other Giam yoga DVD's which are move like a studio yoga experience. This was more like an exercise class.,1373155200,3,118,4.173913043478261
8469900,4,B005FHHDH6,"I have been a formal yogini for, probably, 5 or 6 years now. I supplement my once a week classes with DVD workouts and completed the 21 Day Challenge, when Yoga Journal offered the series on-line.

I practiced the intermediate set of online sessions. (the online challenge had different ""21 Day Workouts"" for different levels.

I purchased the DVD because I really liked the mix of instructors and practices, and the price for a set of high quality practices was extremely reasonable.

The DVD contains a nice schedule for the 21 day practice and recommends a practice for each day. The practices range from a very soothing seated practice, suitable for a beginner with limited mobility (shoulder opening sequence), to challenging sequences leading to more difficult poses (Urdhva Dhanurasana - wheel pose, for example).

Because the practices aren't all designed for the same level student, a beginner with no background or outside instruction might very well find many of the practices hard to follow, as the instructors assume that the viewer is already familiar with performing downward facing dog, plank, child's pose, etc. and only needs cueing to know when to perform the posture.

On the other hand, this is a wonderful collection of varied practices, well designed and executed by an outstanding group of yoga instructors. You could follow the full 21 day schedule, or dip into the varied practices as your need, energy level, skill level and time availability allow. It's a good deal, either way.",1367798400,13,1506,5.056451612903226
