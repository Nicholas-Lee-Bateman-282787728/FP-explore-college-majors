8163155,4,B000LPS2PE,"The DVD (Image Entertainment version) is very good with good transfer quality and the audio is nice.

Ho Meng Hua is probably my favorite Shaw Bros. director because his movies always has a great story to tell with lots of plot twists and so forth with some exploitative kookiness to boot. This movie isn't one of my favorites of his but the story was very well told and the action was good fun. And that's it.",1413331200,,410,4.394736842105263
8163156,5,B000LPS2PE,"When this was released in 1969 Shaw Brothers had turned out literally hundreds of similar-seeming sword-wielding productions so perhaps it is not surprising that some, such this one, have been unfairly overlooked. The biggest misconception to me appears to focus on the action, which is actually rather good, rather than on the drama.
I found it emotionally powerful. Is our heroine really going to kill her own mother, treacherous and manipulative though she is? This movie has a good roster of reliable supporting players and I thought it very well directed, with refreshing confusion-free clarity.
Above all the film centres on the girl's touching relationship with her crippled and increasingly dependent father, but there is a sting in the tale's tail... The father's role is crucial and by default takes centre stage whenever his vengeful plucky daughter (comely Ping Chin) is not on it. He is played by that fine actor Tang Ching, surprisingly not top-billed. Otherwise known as Alan Tang he popped up to (briefer) good effect in an entirely different kind of role in the Shaw-inspired ""The Deaf and Mute Heroine"" (1971), a genuine unmissable likewise masterpiece.

8163157,4,B000LPS2PE,"Greetings y'all, I own the disk that came with the Four Swords Shaw Brothers collection, but I've been led to believe they're identical.  The extras consist of the same set of maybe 2 dozen trailers all these other movies come with.  Absolutely no problems with the disk.

The first hour of this movie can be a bit tough to watch.  It has a lot of what's familiar to the genre and that I enjoy but there's a lot of cheese, with extremely melodramatic music and some odd editing and effects.  But then about an hour in people come to their senses -- mainly I'm thinking of the lead Xiaoyan and how she becomes not only fearless but also a bit smart.  She finally goes out to find vengeance for her family.  The titular golden sword isn't as vital to the movie as you are initially led to believe, but is key to the ending.  If it didn't have such a great payoff I'd have rated this much lower.  The action was quite fun.  I mean yeah, it's absurd and unrealistic but that's not why you watch such a movie!",1243209600,,1004,4.264550264550264
8163158,3,B000LPS2PE,"Vengeance Is A Golden Blade is an early swordfighting/Wuxia film from the legendary Shaw Brothers Studio, and though it's far from required viewing, it does showcase some of the magic the studio possessed in it's glory years.  An excellent cast, lavish sets and costumes, and absurd yet fantastic dramatic beats (like the revealing of the legendary ""Golden Blade,"" as well as a rival sword that takes 18 years to create!) that would even make most American Soap Opera writers blush, all make this a fast and loose watch that never let's the viewer get bored with the proceedings.  The story centers around a pair of rival security firm owners, of course one is a good man while the other is the eldest of the ""Vicious Long Brothers"" (you'd think it would be hard to get security work with that name but...), and the deceitful wife of the honorable security owner who is in cahoots with Mr. Long in an attempt to overtake his firm and control of the powerful sword known as ""The Golden Blade"" (which makes entire hordes of men tremble... pretty funny really).  From here on things aren't always as they seem and like I mentioned earlier, the plot throws all sorts of good stuff at you so I don't want to go much further into it in fear of ruining some of the fun revelations later in the story (besides, one really long run-on sentence is enough for this review right?).  Director Meng Hua Ho is in relatively tame form here, though there are some nice gory blood spurts (for 1969 at least) this is nothing like his more outrageous work with Shaw Studios (which actually may let some viewers down) like Cave Of The Silken Web, The Flying Guillotine, Black Magic, The Oily Maniac, and of course, The Mighty Peking Man.  In fact the only misstep that really sticks out is a few scenes that seem to jump from day to night (and back again) within a matter of seconds?  Was it done to illustrate the changing mood of the characters or is it just sloppy editing?  Who knows, but either way it doesn't detract much from the movie, maybe even giving it a little more of it's own personality.  The swordfighting isn't spectacular either, in fact a lot of the action comes off like the local High School's production of Hamlet (maybe not THAT bad); it has it's moments though.  Vengeance Is A Golden Blade isn't a great movie, in fact, if you are unfamiliar with the Shaw Brothers stable of films then this would be a pretty weak jumping on point even... however; if you're like me and feel the studio could do little wrong, then there's no reason not to add this to your collection (the 3 star rating I gave it is more a reflection of it in comparison to the truly great Shaw offerings, rather than it actually being a mediocre film itself).  The DVD release from Image looks and sounds great but is lacking any special features (I don't count a trailer as a special feature) and has no English dub track either (for those that hate to read).",1212969600,7,2932,4.525519848771267
