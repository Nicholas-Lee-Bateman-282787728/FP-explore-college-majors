4606667,5,B0058YPQ0C,I COULD NOT WAIT UNTIL I RECEIVED THE LAST AND FINAL SEASON OF ENTOURAGE AND WHEN I DID I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED AT ALL. THANK YOU AMAZON ONCE AGAIN.,1341705600,,147,4.103448275862069
4606668,4,B0058YPQ0C,"I have had no issues with any of the seasons of Entourage, and this one was no exception. I still feel like the ending was a lead in to a future movie because the ending leaves you hanging with doors left WIDE open (make sure to watch the little bit after the end credits of the final episode). Seriously, this series could have gone on forever and I'm sad to see it end so I'm hoping for a movie or two in the coming years! One issue I have is Vince's spontaneous decision near the end which I didn't totally buy at all and felt it was rushed. In regards to the actual blu-ray quality it isn't the greatest. There is a lot of grain in a lot of the scenes and it's sometimes distracting. It's still an improvement over the DVD, including the sound which is more crisp, clearer and louder. Oh yeah and fyi, Mrs. Ari's name is finally revealed as Melissa.",1339632000,,853,4.2073170731707314
4606669,3,B0058YPQ0C,"The other reviews I've seen talk about how this was a rushed season and yes, it was.  However I thought it was common knowledge that the season was rushed and ended suddenly and without conclusion because they were making a movie to finish up the series and the unanswered questions/unresolved plot lines.

This was a good season overall with a lot of good episodes from 1-7.  The last episode was definitely mediocre but this is understandable as they wanted to leave the story open ended as to resolve it with the movie.  Not a spin off, not just trying to rush the series to an end... a movie.

With all that being said this was still a very short season and in my opinion should by no means cost the same or more than the other full sized seasons.  I would not recommend buying this in pre-order or right when it comes out for full price.  It's just not worth it to me for only eight episodes for which to really get the full effect and resolution of those episodes you'll have to buy the movie as well making the cost even higher.

4606670,5,B0058YPQ0C,I love Entourage. I have watched all 7 seasons almost 4 times. The characters are hilarious. Yes this season has it's downs but life isn't perfect and I think they did a good job. If you don't like the way it ends suck it up there will be two movies that explain the rest of the story. Yes they did rush it a little bit but maybe they did that so they can jump right into the movies and make it a little more interesting and try to please everybody. (which is impossible) Everything evolves.,1328140800,,491,4.178947368421053
4606671,5,B0058YPQ0C,The show kelp me entertained for 8 seasons and no matter what the critic say we love it in my household thanks for the laughs farwell.,1322956800,,134,4.1923076923076925
4606672,3,B0058YPQ0C,"""Entourage"" is about Hollywood and about friendship, and so it's really nothing at all.  ""Entourage"" is by season eight completely out of gas, and season seven cliff-hanger is that A-list celebrity Vincent Chase has been -- gasp! -- busted for using drugs.  It's clear that the real star is neither Vincent Chase (who plays very well an actor who cannot act and who has no personality) or even his entourage, but his agent Ari Gold, who is what ultimately keeps the show going.  Halfway through the season everyone is bored and tired, and just wants to move on with their lives so they do what anyone else in Los Angeles would find himself in the same situation would do -- they move to New York City.",1322524800,2,701,4.5476190476190474
4606673,3,B0058YPQ0C,"I grew up a big fan of Entourage, In fact I enjoy every now and then to watch it all over since I have all previous seasons. My only issue with season 8 or series finale was the fact they were rushing it since season 7, don't forget that season has only 10 episodes. I think the whole deal for the finale was nicely done but rushed out. Believe me a lot of people will be bitching and complaining about how all of a sudden Vince gets married with the british girl. Producers not even developed that story line. In my humble opinion if they had reached 12 episodes instead 8 they would accomplished a little bit more.",1318032000,9,616,4.228813559322034
4606674,4,B0058YPQ0C,"This is another season that will divide fans because everyone has their own opinion about how the season was supposed to end.

Of the eight episodes of this shortened season, I thought that the first seven were fantastic. However, the series finale ended with a whimper instead of a bang.

Let's start with its good aspects and end with the less positive ones:

(1) The First Seven Episodes - Every character had major conflicts that he needed to resolve in this season.  Johnny Drama is on the cusp of starring in a television show that could rival the ""Simpsons"" and ""Futurama"" in terms of its popularity.  But, he will have to mediate between the strong wills of his co-star, Andrew Dice Clay, and his producer to push the project through. Turtle could make a name for himself as he spear-heads the U.S. launch of Avion tequila; however, despite his street-smarts and enthusiasm, he may not have the business acumen needed to turn a profit.  As far as Eric (""E"") is concerned, he has changed. We all believed that E was a nave minnow trying to protect his friend, Vincent Chase, from the shark-tank that is Hollywood. By this season, we discover that E is a shark himself. Some of his actions this season are so breathtakingly manipulative and cynical that we have to wonder if he has lost his soul.  As E loses his soul, Ari Gold struggles to find his. Once again, Jeremy Piven turns in an acting tour de force, as Ari ponders his life as a potential divorcee. What does a man in his mid-40s with all that clout, intelligence and ambition do when he has suddenly lost the family that kept his darker impulses in-check? This season we get to find out and the end-result is fascinating. Finally, we see yet another side of Vincent Chase. Vince is clean and sober after a court-mandated rehab stint. Internalizing the lessons of his sobriety support group, Vince decides that he is going to enrich the lives of those around him --- by any means necessary. Vince's aggressively good-intentioned meddling in the lives of others has both some awkwardly comedic and shockingly tragic ramifications.  Overall Grade for these 7 episodes: A -minus)

(2) The Final Episode - The series finale seemed disjointed and oddly anti-climatic. This is particularly unfortunate since there were four episodes in the final season which are amongst the best of the series.  HBO, as a whole, has been very hit-or-miss in how it concludes series. The finale to the Sopranos ended abruptly. While ambiguity can be a good thing,that finale seemed to do the series a disservice. Conversely, the finale to Six Feet Under was one of the best I have ever seen. I would place Entourage in the Sopranos category; its clumsy attempt to tie up loose ends will probably have a negative impact on how this season is viewed. (Overall grade for the final episode: D - plus)

With all of this said, Entourage was a great series and I will certainly will miss it.",1317600000,28,2927,4.697265625
4606675,1,B0058YPQ0C,"Season seven was bad. But season eight is just horrible. I could understand trying to go a different direction in season seven to continue the show, but why go so far away from the show's roots in a final season.

The entire season is bad relationship melodrama with nothing else. There is nothing interesting. It is the opposite of fun.

Vince gets involved with what seems like a character left over from an unmade chic flick. You know, the bright uptight reporter from the big city who doesn't like the guy at first but then suddenly decides to instantly marry him without really even knowing him.

Sloan (the boat-anchor of the show) whines her way through another season. And just when it seems that she is finally gone, they bring in a shotgun wedding to fix everything. Its really sad. They spend the whole season creating situations as to why she and Eric should not be together. Then put them together for the worst possible reason.

And then we get a whole lot more Ari family drama. Its all derivative and repetitive from last season. And in the end, all the problems are solved by Italian singers and moving to Italy. Whatever.

In each case, the reasoning is terrible. In each case, the man is completely at fault, the man must give up his friends, the man must give up his career. Its like they had a season of leftover sex-and-the-city scripts. I came away from the last episode thinking ""three inevitable divorces"" rather than happy ending.

The whole drug thing from last season ends up going in an unexpected direction. Vince goes to treatment for a little while and everything is all better. No real consequences to speak of at all.

The problem with Jeremy Piven as Ari Gold is that he only really knows how to play an agent. He transitions to different jobs in the series but the job and how he acts in the job is always the same. Thats not true to business. The things they never really show is (a) him dealing with a younger ""ari"" (what he used to be like) in his own company, (b) the implicit conflicts of interest in running a big company with lots of clients and (c) Vince isn't as important in the big picture to him as he was.

Vince undercuts Drama and Turtle's attempts to strike out on their own by helping each in the wrong way. Turtle in particular ends up looking like an idiot. Some of the stuff with Drama is interesting, but having him get pushed around by Andrew Dice Clay wasn't. It would have been better, in my opinion, for Drama to have been the one holding out with ADC & Billy pushing him to settle.

Somewhere along the way, they lost track of what made entourage fun and why people liked the show. Why with eight episodes left they decided to do a whole season about disfunctional relationships, is beyond me.",1316044800,51,2755,4.494
4606676,3,B0058YPQ0C,"This is a very weird concluding season.  The vast proportion of time is spent on everyone's love life as every male in the show strives to end up happy ever after with the woman of his choice.  This is such a far cry from where this show began that I could scarcely believe it.  Judging from the prior season, I thought we were headed for a very dark, very grim ending instead.  This season resembles a romance novel more than anything else with its stress on finding happy ever after with true love, marriage, babies, etc.,  If the guys had all ended up monks in an abbey, I couldn't have been more surprised. To put it mildly, this is a very surprising twist in everyone's character arc from the prior 7 seasons.

For the show scenes not headed in that direction, we did have a few good moments.  Andrew Dice Clay became the co-star for Drama's cartoon tv series.  Drama and Clay have a huge stand off with the producers for more money.  This is very rooted in show business reality and Clay and Kevin Dillon are wonderful in this sub plot.

Vinny Chase has to pass a drug test and Billy comes up with a fake male appendage to use in the bathroom with the cop.  This fake is even filled with someone else's urine so that he will pass the test.  I found this whole sub plot very funny.

Vinny also tries to save a fellow drug abuser from going over the deep end. This ""gentler, nicer, I want to be part of the solution"" Vinny Chase ends up right on the edge of outright satire in his new personality.  Considering how the show concluded, I think the makers of this show took this conversion seriously but I found it satiric.

And then there is Jeremy Piven as Ari Gold.  We seem to resolve his problems too but after the credits are over, a new scene plays which presents a whole new career path for Ari.  Spin Off.  That's why ENTOURAGE is over is my guess.  They want Piven to star as Ari in his own series in a new Hollywood career. Stay tuned.

I remember liking that 1st season, but had forgotten all about it until I spent a few minutes with Prime in 2018 and came across my long lost series.  I just binge watched the entire 8 seasons in two days and am now watching it again.  Everyone has moved on, and I am wearing out Google catching up on all the buzz & history of Entourage.

I get that the ending for this AWESOME series was designed to leave you, the addicted watcher, wanting but while it was cute and may have caused a few tissues to be plucked from the box by more sentimental watchers and elicited some long drawn out ""Awe"" from die hard romantics, it could have been better and less rushed.

Entourage was the adults Harry Potter and for newbie Fire Stick owners like myself, the best thing to get involved with since Fall football season and the worst distraction from family life and the responsibilities of work.

All-in-all it season * lived up and did not let you down. Yes, Drama, good guys don't always finish last they just marinate and leopards can change their wardrobe when they want to. (Go Eric & Sloan and Ari!!)",1465257600,,773,4.676470588235294

Might be far fetched and as probable as winning the Lottery... bu then someone does win:-)!!!  I loved it and am sure I'll re-watch portions in the years to come.

I watched the movie on a connecting flight for fun thinking it was going to be all drugs, sex, and Hollywood, however I was wrong. This show is pure genius. I never had the chance to watch the show but I decided to give it a try. I know im about a decade late but I honestly have to say this show is by far one of my favorites and will forever be. Every single character has a special place in my heart. I honestly don't know how im going to coupe with coming home from work or the art studio and not being able to unwind and watch a couple episodes. Thank you, just thank you for a great performance and 8 great seasons. You know how they say you loose so much time in front of a screen or watching television...Not a minute lost. Sad to know its over but hey maybe in a couple months ill watch reruns just to get a laugh from Ari yelling at Lloyd or Jonny trying to pick up a girl. Thank you again to the cast and everyone behind this show. I know none of them will ever see this post or rating but you will forever be one of my favorite shows to hit the screens.

To the hopes of more,

They are a delightful ensemble and exemplify what it's like to stick together after growing up in the same neighborhood. Wish that were really true today. So many people are alone. Stick with your buddies and be friends for life. I know this is fiction but not far from the truth.

Still, this season was weak. In the mad dash to get to the finish line, the writers were as lazy as they possibly could be. It was almost a surprise that they didn't end it all with a dream sequence and the final words ""And then I woke up!"".

I'm wondering now if it was actually a big prank, but not so much on the actors (who clearly are NOT in on the joke) but on the audience. This show is either the most unself aware piece of garbage that has ever been made or is actually a not so subtle mocking of the douche/bro it was made for. I can't really tell. If it's not a prank it gets 1 star. If it is then it deserves 5 stars. Since I'm not sure I'll split the difference.",1439856000,,607,4.1525423728813555

4610324,5,B0058YPQ0C,"Clearly I love this - as I watched every episode - and a few years later, watched many again while labeling bottles of La Magie Organic Hair Serum.

This show is so beloved by so many because its characters have heart.  Our lead man, Adrian Grenier as Vincent Chase, is forgiving, understanding, compassionate and of course, gorgeous with undeniably beautiful blue eyes which I'm sure melt every woman who crosses his path. But he's not arrogant or conceited, he takes care of his friends with great generosity of heart, mind and wallet. His brother, Kevin Dillon, bro of Matt, as Johnny Drama, is hysterical as the he man but he has one of the more important roles in the show. For the one or two that ""make"" it in Hollywood, there are thousands, if not millions, of people who didn't get the lucky break, who don't have the long face that photographs well; who may have a dream but who lack talent. And, all of these people relate to Johnny when he tries again and again, and all rejoice when he finally ""gets"" the gig. And, ultimately, some of those gigs fell apart as many shows in Hollywood do that never quite make the race out of the gate.

Jeremy Piven as Ari Gold gives us insights into the ""suits"" that run Hollywood, the money men who truly have learned to make money out of thin air. I have a few times been privileged to watch this financial miracle unfold and really, no one has anything on Hollywood when it comes to financing. Most of the country could take lessons from these guys on creativity because when it comes to creating money, they can make it appear out of thin air and make it disappear just as fast. Back to Jeremy - he's absolutely wonderful giving voice to all the unspoken rages that so many of us feel but never speak.

Actually, I think Jeremy could give lessons in full body acting. I have never seen anyone throw their entire body into representing a feeling as well as Jeremy Piven does. Kuddos, it's a true joy to watch your character go up and down.

I have to give special love to Rex Lee who plays Lloyd. He is so adorable, witty, charming and let it not be forgotten, there is a huge power in the gay community in Hollywood. Some of the brightest lights, creative talents and pure genius reside there.

I love all the characters but I gotta get to work.

GREAT JOB!  Eight more days until I can see the film on my computer - I'll review it for you free if you give me early access :-))",1439769600,2,2427,4.377777777777778

4610420,2,B0058YPQ0C,"I really enjoyed this show up through about season 5 or 6. It got way too serious in the last two seasons and stopped being the fun show that I loved for the break from reality. Season 8 was particularly bad. Everything is going bad for just about everyone, and then it all works out happily in the end for everyone in a 25 minute episode. The finale is a joke, none of the conflicts that existed would be resolved as easily in real life as in the show, which leaves the viewer feeling like he is being played. Very disappointed.

4610661,5,B0058YPQ0C,"So, I'm giving season 8 five stars, but there is a huge condition attached. I'm giving it 5 stars largely because the friendship, the story, and the other seasons were so awesome. I still love ""Entourage"" as long as it's ""Entourage."" The premise, characters, and humor were so awesome, that I don't know how to give the show less than 5 stars. ""Entourage"" on a bad day is better than any show I know of on a good day.

That being said, this season was pretty weak, and the tone of it changed way too much, and went out of my comfort zone. It was disturbingly dark and ""Entourage"" and creator Doug Ellin don't do dark very well. Ellin and the show are unabashedly optimistic and fun, and the darkness just played awkwardly in seasons 7 and 8. I've heard people say that Doug Ellin essentially got lucky with ""Entourage,"" and that his talent couldn't always keep up with the show's success, and I tend to think that's true. For example, seasons 7 and 8. The story lines were awkward, and didn't always even make sense. For example, Vincent Chase's head injury that caused his wild behavior. It was never addressed and never resolved. The problem just kind of disappeared when Ellin figured that enough dark stuff had happened, and when it was time to wrap the 8th season. I'm not sure if the writing was lazy, or if Ellin's lack of talent just caught up with him, and it was all the sound of a marginally talented guy running out of ideas and getting fatigued. The best episodes were written by two writers named Mark Abrams and Mike Benson. Doug Ellin did a decent job with plenty of the scripts and he really knew how to write Ari Gold, but his writing was only occasionally spectacular.

Handing the show off partly to writer Ally Musika was also a grave mistake. She turned the whole thing into a running soap opera drama that was too bitter, weepy, and feminine but it was partly Ellin's fault too for getting the ball rolling in that direction. Someone commented that Scott Caan was embarrassing to watch, and I partly agree. He had a good ""masculine energy"" that fit the show well, but he was really unlikable and didn't fit the vibe. He didn't really deserve a sacred spot close to the inner circle of the entourage. He truly was a douche, like his character, and while he had up and down qualities, I wouldn't have missed him if he weren't there.

Overall, season 8 sucked compared to the first 6 seasons but, it still being ""Entourage,"" I give it 5 stars. Like I said, ""Entourage"" on a bad day is better than any other show on a good day.",1429142400,4,2546,4.459227467811159

The early seasons followed a story line but each episode was pretty much independent of each other.

4610871,2,B0058YPQ0C,"I binge watched all 8 seasons of Entourage and the last one really fell short. Vinnie Chase comes out of rehab only to be fawned over by his brother and friends. After that, so many conveniences ensue that one is left wondering just how lazy the writers could be. An super agent Ari Gold hits rock bottom, but his foul mouth antics go even lower, to the point that the language made me wince. There was no reason to be that disgusting. We already knew what his character was like and if he was going to redeem himself, then let him do it gradually and gracefully with a bit of reform here and there that could be perceived as an effort to be a better person instead of just a desperate guy pulling out all the stops. Then there Eric Murphy, whining and complaining, battling with Sloan until she drops a huge surprise in his lap. Eric is the least likable character, who also happens to take over an agency of his own with Scott Lavin (played well by Scott Caan). And even Lavin's character is just another foul-mouthed agitator. No range was exhibited in this season, except for maybe Johnny Drama who finally gets a decent break only to blow it, almost, due to differences with Andrew Dice Clay of all people. Turtle rises and falls and rises again, yes thanks to Vinnie's generosity. It all wraps up in a too-neat package with Vinnie falling in love in 24 hours. Seriously? Bed hopper Vinnie decides to lock in with one lady just like that? His rehab must have been something else! Oh, well, it had to end somewhere. I just wish it would have been at least 12 episodes instead of cheating us with 8, and the writers would have done their jobs with more effort.",1383523200,,1663,4.420195439739413

Turtle is just annoying and whiny; Drama has become even more of a buffoon and an unfunny one at that; E's storylines are silly; Vince and his re-hab babble are irritating and naive.

After hating Vince, you finally remember why you always loved the guy and many character arcs are fulfilled.
Its a movie stars life, there cannot be an epic conclusion as their careers are always ongoing forever.

After a while it gets boring, We saw him rise to fame and then fall and then rise and fall again only to drugs.
This time we watch him rise and see how he takes his best friends and helps set them up for life as well.

Its a fitting ending. feels a little cheesy. But I liked it. If you want classic entourage just re-watch season 1-3 over and over.",1362960000,8,678,4.121212121212121

4611004,3,B0058YPQ0C,"THE GOOD- Drama's storyline provides the most laughs for the season.  Dice holding up the network for more money is consistent with his infamous ego.  It plays beautifully in this storyline with a tormented Drama must choose between a potential tv series or his loyalty to his friend Dice.  Ari's storyline was also very good and is given much funnier stuff than he was in season seven.  Most importantly, is the inclusion of Lloyd, who was reduced to a background character (I have no idea why) in season 7.  Scott (E's business partner) steals the season. He was hilarious as a dirty-minded sleazeball.
THE BAD-  E's storyline is flat out annoying.  With him and Sloan acting like two high school kids by saying they don't want to be in each other's lives anymore.  So, why are they always calling each other on the phone and paying visits to each other?  E acts uncharacteristically sleazy in this season and is not the sharp character he was in previous seasons.  They then add some unnecessary twist to E's story, which was probably done solely for the fact it was the show's last season.  Vince had a decent storyline going until it's god awful conclusion, which no fan bought for a mili-second.  Turtle never seems to pay for all his stupidity and poor business decisions.  Once again, Turtle walks out unscathed after making yet another business blunder.  The resolution of his story is equally preposterous as Vince's.  The last two episodes of this season are so slapdashed together it ruins the first six good episodes.
THE DEAL- Despite it's hokey finale, this season is funnier than season 7.  Had they done 12 or 13 episodes this would have been a much better season.  But even with 12 episodes or so, I still wouldn't have bought the lame conclusion they had for Vince.  They should have left it more open-ended instead of forcing a sense of closure.  That would have been better.  Also, it may have helped to close out by reinforcing the unity of the gang they will always be there for each other.  But the way it was concluded made that an impossibility.  A horrible ending for an otherwise good-very good show.",1359590400,,2128,4.694594594594594
4611005,5,B0058YPQ0C,Watching Entourage makes me want to workout LOL. Never have I cried during an espisode of Entourage until the very last one of the series. I balled for probably the last 10 mins of the show. It was a great ending :),1359417600,,215,4.142857142857143

4611031,2,B0058YPQ0C,No Spoilers....  I will say though that I was disappointed in this season. I thought season 7 wasn't great but was not terrible. Season 8 in my opinion was terrible. The story lines simply were implausible and poorly developed. The season seemed rushed and quite frankly I thought it was disservice to what in my opinion was the best show on TV.

4611064,4,B0058YPQ0C,"My only problem was that it was only 8 episodes. I loved this show - it is one of my favorites of all time. I love the characters and the way they interact with each other. I love all of the characters from Ari to Lloyd to Vince to E to Drama to Turtle to Sloan and Ms. Gold and the rest. They are fantastic (I love Ari the most). But only 8 episodes? Come on, HBO! I understand that Marky Mark was ready to move on to other projects so whatever.

Regardless, good season. The ending was a little disappointing but when you think about it, I couldn't really think of a better way for them to end the series. They had to put an end on it and they had to make it conclusive for all five of the main characters (I include Ari in that set). They had to put a conclusion on it and I think they did that as well as possible. Would you have preferred a mid-sentence breakaway a la Sopranos? THAT was disappointing to me - not Entourage's ending. They made it satisfying.

Anyway, the packaging is good - its the typical DVD set you expect. It has extras which are decent, but nothing special to write home about. I never really care much for the extras though so I'm not the best to ask about those.

The show is great and if you are reading these reviews, you already know you want it - just get it and enjoy it. Just accept that the show is ending after the 8 episodes in this short season - as sad as that is. I will miss Entourage.",1355616000,,1428,4.03886925795053

After years of Vince having short and long-term affairs with countless women, in two episodes he finds his true love, and in one episode Ari walks away from his multi-million dollar business as the only way to save his marriage, and they all just fade into the sunset and hop on luxury private jets.

4611088,2,B0058YPQ0C,"I have been a huge Entourage fan since the first episode and now own all 8 seasons.  There were some amazingly funny episodes in this final season, just like all other seasons, but I have some serious complaints.

First, how absolutely terrible is the ending?  Stop reading if you haven't watched it, but the idea of Vince getting married to a smart educated chick he just met, an untalented Drama making it big, a Turtle bordering on pathetic all season becoming a multi-millionare, and Eric getting back with Sloan after his encounters with her ex-step mom, all happening in the final episode is an insulting conclusion to anyone who watched the show.  The only character's ending which I could even mildly accept was Ari quitting his job to reconcile with Mrs. Ari.

Also, while I love your product, the greedy executives at HBO who continue to break up final seasons need to be fired.  How can there be 16 and 24 episode seasons through a series, but then an 8-episode Season 7 and Season 8?  Soprano's, Sex and the City, and basically every other big HBO series they've produced as done the same thing (or made it Season 6, Part 1 and Part 2).

So many surprises, it perhaps went a little over the top at times but still I loved it.  It was anything but predictable and I'm sad that it had to end.",1344124800,,276,3.892857142857143
4611094,5,B0058YPQ0C,"With this set we now own the entire series on DVD, and it was a great ride.

This last season was classic Entourage, and I enjoyed each episode just as much as the early seasons.  The characters we love were all given some closure.

My only complaint is that there were only 8 half hour episodes on two discs, so this last ""season"" was very short.",1342569600,,347,4.2272727272727275
4611095,5,B0058YPQ0C,"While the 7th Season was very unpleasant to watch, because of the sexcapades, this was the complete antithesis. Entourage ends on a high note with all the characters maturing and meeting life with a higher set of values and adult behavior. It was lots of fun to watch and we felt it was the best Season of all. We applaud the writers for bringing the characters back to earth again with happy endings for all. We all need to strive for understanding and the characters moved along a very nice path to that end.",1342483200,,510,4.4361702127659575
4611096,3,B0058YPQ0C,"It started going downhill in S7 when scott caan was given a role as ""one of the gang"" --- not quite sure how he got the gig but he must be buds with Mark Wahlberg or something. It just did not feel true to life that someone like that would just waltz into the crew and be accepted and in S8 it got worse. 2 late 20 somethings take over a major talent agency from a lifetime industry veteran. The writers were getting lazy at this point.

Then adding Andrew Dice Clay into the mix was just laughable - I guess again Mr Wahlberg was just doing this sad old freak a favor!

Overall a great series and if you watched the first 6 by all means watch the last 2 but be warned the writers got lazy and watching scott caan is painful !",1342396800,5,726,4.0
4611097,5,B0058YPQ0C,Watching Entourage over the past decade has been truly entertaining.  Every season gets better and ends with a great season 8.  On to the movie,1342224000,,143,4.68
4611098,5,B0058YPQ0C,"Why are so many people down on the last and final season, Season 8?  Simple answer is they have no imagination.  If you are the type of person that has to see all ends wrapped up, i's dotted and t's crossed, you will not like this.  I know there are rumors of a movie, but the show ended perfectly. I won't spoil it, but characters develop, things change, there are ups, and there are downs.  Wow....just like real life.

Just keep this in mind.... IT'S FICTION!!!! These guys are not real people, they are who you want to be, don't want to be, and wish you were.  That is why the show is fun.  It takes you out of your sofa and put's you in L.A. and in with the ""it"" crowd.  Use your imagination to cross the t's and dot the i's.

As much as I want to see a movie, I'm not sure it can ever live up to what I think they are all doing today.",1341878400,,840,3.923076923076923
