4510345,4,B004ZKKL46,"For years, I've heard people go on about Voltron: Defender of the Universe but have never seen it. So, when I see Voltron: The Legend Begins on the shelf at my local Wal-Mart for real cheap, I decide to get it. Voltron: The Legend Begins basically gives you 7 full episodes that tells the origin story of a team of space explorers who search for the keys to five mythical robot lions on the planet Arus.  Arus has been ruined by the armies of King Zarkon and his use of giant Robeast monsters created by the witch Haggar.  Arus's only hope lies in the discovery of these five robot lions, which combine together to form Voltron.

If you hadn't seen Voltron, like me, this is a great place to start before collecting the whole series.

I loved it. It's a classic. It even features Michael Bell from Legacy of Kain fame.",1313798400,17,818,4.397350993377484
