4371366,4,B004FV4R8G,"There are so many outstanding UK law and crime shows that one can't help compare them to one another. This is another entry and it is a very good one but I can't say it knocks me out like so many of the UK series do. We first saw this setting in RUMPOLE, of the trying of cases by barristers and their all trying to advance themselves in the Inns of Court.  Becoming QC is paramount, called ""wearing silk"" and hence the title. That is exactly what two barristers are trying to do, get the silk being dangled in front of them.  So we watch them try cases while they go about this.  There is no humor, like there was in Rumpole though, which is a big loss.  Also, these cases are not riveting drama like THE ACCUSED, another UK law series which is absolutely fantastic. Nor is JUDGE DEED which had the absolutely splendid Martin Shaw hearing these cases as the judge. However, these are well written dramas about interesting cases.  I would rent these, not buy them.  I can't imagine watching them twice.

The dynamics between the characters as well as the situations they find themselves in keep me entertained. But it is something that I only reach for when there isn't something better to do.",1484697600,,314,4.625
4371375,5,B004FV4R8G,"Excellent British courtroom drama, with interesting plot developments both in and out of the court.
Adding to the interest are the different ways in which law is practiced in Great Britain compared to the US. For instance, the attorney who ""designs"" and plans the defense (the Solicitor) is not the lawyer who pleads the case in court; that is the job of the Barrister, who collaborates with the Solicitor on strategy. Too cumbersome and wasteful, in my opinion, but interesting to watch.",1483056000,,488,4.963414634146342

It helps to have a little knowledge of the role of barristers, solicitors and clerks, but it is not necessary to enjoy this well-done series.

The best stories are about more than they at first appear to be, their narrative weaves in complexities and moral issues that we all struggle with. ""Silk"" massively succeeds in moving beyond the confines ambition, the law, and workplace strife, to a larger story of life. Well done, can't wait for Season 3!",1470873600,3,419,5.176470588235294

However Season 2 is very expensive and therefore I cannot review it,as I did not purchase it, along with the new $4.99 outrageous shipping price, I am very saddened by this. I had bought, through you season 3,from the UK, and so now wait for the price and the shipping cost to come down,,same for Crown For Christmas a Hallmark Hall of Fame movie, it is more than twice the price it was at Walllmart when they had the exclusive after it was shown. So how about it, think about the business you will ,lose by being greedy, with shipping costs and prices of new DVD's, it kinda is bad business, especially for returning

4371445,5,B004FV4R8G,"Why British programming so much better than the U.S.?  This show has it all....great actors, fantastic dialogue, lots of action for a courtroom setting, the drama of a rising female star as a candidate for ""silk"" and a fading, but still ""dishy"", male lead in Rupert Penry-Jones.  (loved him in 39 Steps)  Long may this series run!!!",1457136000,,332,4.7894736842105265
4371446,4,B004FV4R8G,I enjoy watching how the British do things.  While their legal system is quite different than ours I do find it interesting.  The first season of Silk was very good and I have ordered the second season.

4371454,5,B004FV4R8G,"I love this series......the English system is quite a bit different than ours, but the differences and the characters are what make it a great series.  I've followed on PBS and have enjoyed seeing it all again.  Can't wait for more!  I'm hard of hearing so I use close caption, and I recommend that just to assist following along with the characters accents.",1448496000,,358,4.650793650793651

My BIG complaint is that Season 2 and 3 are not for Region 1, which is the U.S. So, I do have a small international DVD player, however the picture is much smaller. Could they make those seasons for Region 1????",1438732800,,337,4.540983606557377

4371463,5,B004FV4R8G,Absolutely loved this show!  For us Americans it helps a bit to know that the British legal system is slightly different than in the US.  Wikipedia is your friend to understand that barristers and solicitors are both lawyers but barristers argue in court and solicitors don't and how that impacts the politics of the legal system.  Really excellent show!  Wish there were another series/season!!!!,1436745600,,397,5.15625

4371472,5,B004FV4R8G,"This show is fascinating. It's a little hard to follow the plot sometimes but that's not something that bothers me since if I like a show I'll watch it again a few times, and the plot will gradually become clear. The court routines (and lawyers) in England are very different than in the U.S., so that is fun to watch and try to figure out.

I was a little puzzled by the ""apprentice lawyers,"" since they seemed not to know very much law at all, but were thrust in front of judges anyway and had to rely on their wits, if any. That didn't seem very believable to me, but maybe that's the way it works over there.",1428537600,,612,4.186440677966102
4371473,4,B004FV4R8G,"I didn't watch much of this when it aired on my local PBS because, despite the consistently good Rupert Penry-Jones (Spooks, 39 Steps), I couldn't warm to Maxine Peake.  But after seeing her excellent performance in Criminal Justice 2, decided to give Silk a second go on dvd.  I still find it almost impossible to believe her character here and this is not one of Penry-Jones's best roles; however, Neil Stuke is great.  The stories are interesting enough.  While dithering between giving this 4 or 5 stars, I ordered both the second and third series; you'll have to watch it and decide for yourselves.",1428105600,,603,4.769230769230769

4371477,4,B004FV4R8G,"So far, I really like it, but man, I watch with closed captioning. The speech and acting is very fast-paced. I had to look up what the meaning of ""silk"" on wikipedia during the first episode. The British legal system appears really constipated. Yet, I am enjoying the series, the only thing slow is some cigarette breaks.",1426550400,,321,4.649122807017544

4371480,1,B004FV4R8G,I purchased this Dvd for friends for Chirstmas 2014.  They recently informed me that it does not play on their system.  This is an Australian series but it should still play on a US system.  I am very disappointed.  It is too late now for me to return this Dvd set.,1424044800,,265,4.137254901960785

4371484,5,B004FV4R8G,Great UK show. It does not seem to have a second season.,1417651200,,56,3.75
4371485,5,B004FV4R8G,"First off, this is a view from the British system, quite parliamentary and filled with wigs and stiff judges. But behind the scenes, the British and American law firms are the same, doling out cases both for the defense and the prosecution, the in-house fighting still juggling for position, and the chess games moving into the courtroom. Which is where this series really takes off. Outstanding writing from Peter Moffat (who seems to have an extensive background in the judicial side of the court system), and even better acting, both good enough to keep this breakaway series fresh and a nice change of pace from the usual CSI-type dramas that flood both sides of the Atlantic. This is what happens AFTER the arrest, the planning of the trial and then the actual trial, as well as how each barrister deals with the pending results, often knowing that while they are right by law, the guilty party just might get off due to a lack of evidence for the jury. This tears at the lead actress, Martha, who values her moral and legal decisions and is torn by knowing the law and yet knowing how some are able to use that to get out of a crime. All in all, this first series (this ran three seasons but only season one is available in the US) is captivating with less soapiness then the covers leads you to believe. Give it a try...Maxine Peake's background (she plays the lead) mimics the role she plays, that of working her way up from a middle class background, part of the reason she was chosen in the auditions. As you'll discover, it was an excellent choice. One of the more overlooked BBC series, this is worth watching!",1415836800,2,1622,4.558219178082192

4371488,4,B004FV4R8G,"There's no shortage of good legal TV series in the US--as far back as ""The Defenders"" and including the current evening soap ""The Good Wife"", but ""Silk"" is well worth viewing as well--an excellent, intelligently written and original take on a justice system that varies in some major ways from that in the US.",1411862400,2,309,4.7407407407407405
4371489,5,B004FV4R8G,This is a great series.  An eye-opener about the British jurisprudence.  I like the main characters and the actors so much.,1411344000,,123,4.809523809523809

4371491,5,B004FV4R8G,I recommend this movie highly.,1410998400,,30,5.2
4371492,2,B004FV4R8G,"I expected to thoroughly enjoy SILK and was actually in for a disappointing surprise. The series does have a great cast but SILK is slow moving and rather confusing. Maybe a better understanding of the British judicial system would have helped. It was clear that earning ""silk"" was an honor but it was never clear to me what ""silk"" was . I had to research that on my own. I was also confused about Defense and Prosecuting barristers were all working in the same office. The seedy Billy seemed to be in charge but wasn't a barrister but rather a clerk. It all made for a lot of confusion as cases came and went at lightning speed. Rarely was there any build-up to a case, though we do see two defendants charged in two different cases in Series One.
The slow pace of everything was unnerving as we were thrown tidbits of scandal. Office politics and romances and secrets can make for good stories but everything was thrown at us in pieces. Maybe Series Two will help clarify these story line. One of the ""pupils"" was a shoplifter, yet that was left up in the air as to what was happening.
Maxine Peake does a fine job as Martha Costello. She clearly loves her work and has earned her status. She has worked her way up in a male-dominated field and is on her road to ""silk"" along with Clive Reader (Rupert Penry-Jones). Again, they work in the same office but sometimes are in court as prosecutor or defender. It's always nice to see lovely Natalie Dornier--this time as pupil Niamh Cranitch.
I was disappointed in this series but it is clear it has a large fan base. There are just so many better shows from BBC in my opinion.",1408924800,,1625,4.42

4371504,3,B004FV4R8G,"I watched this, then turned it off, then went back to it again frankly because I watch too much television and ran out of things to watch. The cast is appealing and the stories are interesting enough to hold my attention, but there is a lack of real tension in this series. I see how the plots create urgency, but I don't really believe it. It's a second rate show (which doesn't mean don't watch it.)

I am a child of Law and Order, Mad Men, Breaking Bad, even Sons of Anarchy which I gave up on long ago. I am still hanging in there while GRR Martin blithely wipes out hosts of characters I care about because he needs reality in a show where a women is ""the mother of dragons,"" a dwarf is the best soldier you've got and the dead won't stay down.

GIVEN THAT. The pacing is a little speedy in Silk particularly given the lack of gritty details provided that might beef up the lives of these people and once you set a story in a world where everyone is physically and economically safe (which I'm all for. my life isn't like that) you'd better create danger that I buy. The conversations are rarely all that gripping. Yes, heroes by definition will win and that's why you watch the show, but sometimes when I'm not worried whether a hero will win I get a little peeved.",1400803200,,1271,4.269709543568465

The operational aspects of the British litigation system as depicted were a bit breath taking.  In my thankfully few interactions with the legal system here in the States, I often suspected that attorneys waited until the last minute to prepare for court.  The British system as represented takes that suspicion quite literally, as we see the litigators pickup tomorrow's case(s) this evening for the disputation tomorrow.  Yikes!

But our heroine is a wonder of toughness but really a model of all that is considered good by a certain class of people. All stories end in politically correct and very predictable endings, and that is always a bore. So all in all, the underlying theme to be ""sensitive"" and not poke any particular group in the eye keeps this a tame and lame series.",1384560000,2,510,4.494623655913978
4371553,4,B004FV4R8G,"There are plenty of other reviews posted already so I won't rehash lots of the info already provided. I will say that I agree with my fellow Top 100 reviewer, K Harris, that with so many similar courtroom dramas being produced by British (and Australian) television, some stand out above the rest. I'd put Silk - at least this first season (six hour-long episodes)  - in the category of ""the rest"". I was interesting to watch but the cases almost telegraphed their outcomes.

Readers of the reviews should be aware that when this series was shown in the US, it was trimmed to 50 minutes to allow for ""funding announcements"" and previews of other shows. The DVD (there is, unfortunately, no Bluray release of the show) contains the original 59 minutes per episode BBC series (as des the Amazon streaming version, I am told).

The DVD also contains the now -requisite ""Behind The Scenes"" featurette as a ""bonus"". This 13 -minute short consists of interviews with each of the main cast members about their character as well as the series producer and the writer, These comments are integrated with scenes from the show. It's unusual because, while you should probably watch this after you have seen the series (it's on Disc 2 of 2), the comments also explain how the British court system works, which can be helpful to know beforehand.

So, in summary, I'm awarding this DVD four stars. Yes, I like it but, as I said, it is not the BBCs most engaging series, in my opinion.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

4371554,5,B004FV4R8G,Maxine Peake is truly amazing a tour de force performance. The storyline and character developement is very strong and it is very interesting to an American audience. The supporting cast is excellent. I love this series. I can't wait for the next installment.,1383868800,,259,5.046511627906977
4371555,4,B004FV4R8G,"Maxine Peake, who plays Martha Costello, does an excellent job of portraying a female Barrister who is smart and powerful yet real and caring.  Her counterpart, Ruppert Perry-Jones, who plays Clive Reader, also does an excellent job of adding real-life elements to his character despite the stereotypical nature of his role as a cocky, good-looking, female-chasing Barrister. And Neil Stuke, who plays Billy Lamb, the Senior Clerk, always keeps us guessing. I wouldn't play poker with that guy!

The show is fast-paced, with good camera direction, none of this tricking the viewer by focusing on a guy's wristwatch when it was his briefcase beside him that was important to the story. When something does flash rather briefly on the screen it is done in order to build intrigue, and it is always referenced quickly, usually within the next couple of scenes.  And if you can't watch a show without incredibly good-looking people in it, this show has two that should feed that need.

The only reason I would not give it 5 stars is because of the lack of characters who uphold traditional values. As the series progressed, I became disappointed with the values of some of the characters.  Having said that, these characters are very realistic, people who are both good and bad; no one is entirely immoral or evil. But the part of the show that I liked the best was the insight into the politics and the cases which offered me, the viewer, plenty of plot twists, intrigue, and humor.",1382140800,5,1479,4.830039525691699

It makes the confrontation between her and her pupil, over her behavior toward the police panel, seem inappropriate.  Billy telling Jake about her pregnancy means that all of chambers is made aware of her condition.  How can I be charged for an episode that deletes such vital information?  Where is the argument with Martha and Billy over her needing ""gentle"" treatment?  This goes directly to the difficulty of life at the bar for women.

4371565,5,B004FV4R8G,"Seasons one and two of Silk are extraordinary, splendidly written and splendidly acted drama. Yes, Silk is a ""legal drama,"" but somehow that category seems quite inadequate. Although the characters' ""home lives"" are implied they are virtually never dramatized.  On the other hand the rivalries and tensions of their work lives are vivid, believable and fascinating. And although the courtroom battles are perforce conducted verbally, each one turns out to reveal so much more about the various cases assigned to the barristers that it seems fair to call them both mysteries and thrillers. My husband and I watched these side by side, and at times we were convulsed with laughter, at times in tears, and most of the time we were simply riveted. In fact we found Silk too exciting to watch directly before bedtime. But do be very clear about this: these dramas are for the many reviewers here who hunger for highly intelligent television and bemoan the swift cancelation of excellent shows in favor of ""reality television"" (terrible misnomer) or soap opera schlock. While it is true that we will very soon re-watch both seasons, it is also true that we went back so often to re-watch and clarify or simply to savor scenes that we have very nearly watched it twice already.

4371572,4,B004FV4R8G,"I saw Silk on Masterpiece Theatre over the past few weeks. Fascinating how law firms and courts work in the UK - I recommend watching the three Season 1 episodes (you can see them on PBS for short time) just for that reason alone.
This show has been running in the UK for three years but Season 1 just began became available this summer in the US.
Martha Costello, the chamber's top barrister is applying for Silk (to be a Q.C. -Queen's Counselor). The story line revolves around her significant abilities as a barrister in the courtroom whether defending or prosecuting - as she is working her way to Silk.
 She is played extremely well by Maxine Peake. You will recognize her egotistical peer, Clive, played by Rupert Perry-Jones, from other BBC series and Tom Hughes, who is showing up in British and American films more and more. The story lines move quickly and somewhat unevenly at times but it is worth watching.",1379030400,,919,4.638036809815951
4371573,4,B004FV4R8G,"""The series' title refers to the act of being appointed a Queen's Counsel, known as ""taking silk"". Queen's Counsel wear distinctive full-bottomed wigs and silk gowns when they appear in Court. It is this gown which gives rise to the colloquial reference to Queen's Counsel as ""silks"" as well as to the phrase ""taking silk"" referring to their appointment."" Wiki

Silk is a superb drama from BBC that follows a set of lawyers or barristers as known in the UK. Life for a barrister is a little different than layers in the US. The Chambers or barristers' chambers are the set of professional rooms used by a barrister or an association of barristers. There is a senior clerk who runs the chambers financially and All the legal work. He assigns all the cases that come to his chambers, and it is very competitive. Billy Lamb, played by Neil Stuke leads this chamber.

Martha Costello, played by Maxine Peake, is one of the best and most intelligent of the barristers in this chamber. Her ambition, as it is all of the barrristers is to become Queen's Counsel. This chamber also has Clive Reader, played by Rupert Penry-Jones, who is one of the most ruthless and a womanizer of this group. They are both in the running for the Silk, which keeps this series Jumping. There are other barristers, one of whom is trying to get rid of Billy. The chambers also have two interns, very young lawyers, just out of college. One of whom steals his gown and wig which did not seem plausible.

I liked this series, Martha Costello is superb as the best of the barristers, not content to let any other barrister do anything but their best. She has high expectations that she expects everyone should meet. Several unexpected complications develop that brings this particular chambers closer. Just enough drama all around.

4371574,5,B004FV4R8G,"If you like British series and legal dramas, this is a delightful combination of the two. The primary characters, though flawed, are endearing. You follow barrister Martha Costello (Maxine Peake) and her colleague -- and sometimes friendly rival -- Clive Reader (Rupert Penry-Jones) as they argue cases in court whilst striving to get their ""silk"" and Queen's Counsel status. Once barristers attain the rank of Queen's Counsel, they are allowed to wear a long wig and a silk robe. Costello's and Reader's law firm works with a mix of English society. Cases they try include burglary and assault, rape and attempted murder among other offenses. Nothing too grisly is portrayed.

It's fun to note the differences between the British and American systems - in one episode there's a jab at the American court protocol when the judge tells a young attorney to quit moving around so much, that it's not an American court of law.

You observe the wild frumpy wigs, and see where the phrase ""bigwig"" comes from. In the English system, the lawyers sit and the witnesses stand. It appears the witnesses don't just answer the question, they are allowed to talk for a bit. Interestingly, the same law firm can take the prosecution and defense roles with different attorneys. Makes you wonder which legal system gets better results.

The secondary characters are a delight in this series, too. There's the charismatic and peripatetic Billy Lamb (Neil Stuke) who is Senior Clerk and doles out assignments and $$$. There are two young assistants or interns, Niamh who is a daughter of a judge and played by a blonde Natalie Dormer and Nick, who can barely afford his legal supplies, played by Tom Hughes. Their different circumstances juxtapose nicely. It's refreshing to look at the legal profession through their young and not yet jaded eyes, full of aspirations and ideals.

Found this an entertaining series as I particularly enjoy the strategy in legal dramas. I liked the warmth of the characters in this series. Written by Peter Moffat, the series is inspired by his personal experiences as a barrister. In an interview with The Guardian, Moffat said, ""I want to tell it as it really is. The extreme pressure, the hard choices, the ethical dilemmas, the overlap between the personal and the professional, principles fought for and principles sacrificed, the Machiavellian politics, the sex, the drinking, the whole story--life at the bar is the richest possible drama territory.""

This series includes some of all of that. Likable characters, entertaining plots, atmospheric British backdrop, and intelligent dialogue mix charmingly. 4.5 stars for me, but I'm an anglophile and enjoy most well-done British series. This series seemed to entertain more than be a deep, dramatic portrayal of the legal world in England. Only critique I have is for the makeup department to tone down Costello's red lipstick a tad.",1378944000,6,2903,5.064853556485356

4371579,5,B004FV4R8G,"If you like British series and legal dramas with some character development, you may want to sample this series.  I watched it with no expectations and it grew on me.  The characters, though flawed, are endearing.  The series centers around Martha Costello (Maxine Peake) who is trying to get her silk and Q.C. (Queen's Counsel) status along with a colleague Clive (Rupert Penry-James) who hopes to achieve the same.  There's a bit of friendly rivalry there.

Their law firm has a boat-load of cases to try and you follow Martha in the court room.  It's fun to note the difference between the British and American system - in one episode there's a jab at the American court protocol when the judge tells a young attorney to quit moving around so much, that it's not an American court of law.

You note the wild wigs (and learn where the phrase ""big-wig"" comes from), the lawyers sit, the witnesses stand, and it seems the witnesses don't just answer the question, they are allowed to talk for a bit. And the same law firm can take the prosecution and defense roles with different attorneys.  Not sure they have public prosecutors.  It's fun to see the legal strategy at work.

Found this a very delightful series, but I never over-dosed on legal dramas.  Legal dramas still seem fresh and intriguing to me and I liked the warmth of the characters in this series.  Although one recommendation for make-up, they need to tone down the red lipstick on Martha Costello a tad.

4371580,4,B004FV4R8G,"If you have watched Suits, the law agency series on US TV, you will understand this British series.  I think Silk is the better series to watch.  Silk's focus is not on the back biting, get ahead anyway you can, mean spirited, down right hateful people that work at the law firm.  In Silk you do see the inner workings, and relationships at the law firm, but each episode deals with clients they represent throughout a trail in the British court system. It is fascinating just to watch the differences between the US court system and the British system. The lead defense lawyer is a strong women character without being harsh, and I liked that even though she wins her cases, not all of her clients were inocent. I thought her reactions to her wins adds to her likeability.  If you have a Prime membership I would add this to your watch list.",1378080000,3,842,4.483660130718954

4371582,4,B004FV4R8G,"I watched episode one with interest, and the show did manage to hold my attention.

My overall impression is that Silk is a sort of poor man's version of Rumpole of the Bailey.
Instead of Leo McKern as Rumpole, we have Maxine Peake as Martha Costello.

Rumpole was a curmudgeonly senior citizen whose only real problem in life was in dealing with his wife Hilda whom he affectionately referred to as ""she who must be obeyed.""  That and the fact that he wasn't particularly adept at the politics in his chambers were his only problem.

Martha Costello is a 35-year-old single woman who seems to be constantly looking at her positive pregnancy test.  She's a bit too angst-ridden for my taste.

The scenes in chambers are very reminiscent of the Rumpole stories.

Still, I'm willing to give it a chance for a few more episodes.  At least, the series is head and shoulders above just about any program you could name that's currently showing.",1377561600,8,939,4.682926829268292
4371583,4,B004FV4R8G,"If I needed a lawyer, I would want Martha Costello. She is passionate, intelligent, wily and will go to any lengths to prove you are innocent. She is a lawyer for the downtrodden.

'Silk' s the latest BBC offering to the states on our PBS stations As host Alan Cumming explains in the first-night introduction, ""Silk"" refers to the prestigious position of Queen's Counsel: In British court, these high-ranking barristers wear gowns of silk (also those crazy wig hats). Our Martha Costello played by Maxine Peake is but one in her firm looking for thebSilk. The other barrister, Clive Reader, played by Rupert Pen Jnes is also going for the the Silk. He is one who plays loose and wild with games, and our Martha one-ups him in case after case.

We get to know Martha a little, see her at home working on cases, dancing by herself to viny reviews on the recordplayer. She is one of the best, but no home life, yet. Another interesting player in ths series is the 'Senior Clerk', Billy Lamb. It is his job to assign cases from solicitors who oversee the criminal cases. We see Billy trying to balance the books and advance the careers of those barristers in his care. We see Martha covering at least two complicated cases at a time, with little or no time to,prepare. You must be on your toes, and use your 'pupil', a young lawyer waiting his turn at the big time.

The characters are delicious. We already see in episode one that some barristers are not happy and want to uproot Billy from his job. Office politics are very much in the midst. Clive thrives on sex with his young pupil and cocaine. Martha does not much like Clive, but she understands he is a worthy competitor, and she's on her toes. Martha is a very attractive blonde, and she has followers, not always the good kind.

I look forward to the series and hope Martha makes her Silk. Clive doesn't deserve it, yet, too much of a player.
