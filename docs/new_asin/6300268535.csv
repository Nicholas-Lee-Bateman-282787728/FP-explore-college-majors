283437,5,6300268535,"John Huston's ""Reflections In A Golden Eye"" is one of his lesser-known works. This overlooked film is a riveting piece of Cinema. He brought together the unlikely combination of Carson McCuller's southern gothic novel along with the talents of Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando, and Julie Harris to create a fascinating study of deceit, lies, and murder.
  Julie Harris brings to the project her unique blend of neurosis and pathos. She inhabits the role as Allison the mentally fragile wife of Brian Keith fully, coloring her role with the nuance of madness.
  Keith gives his best performance as the philandering husband of Harris and the bumbling lover of Taylor. It is his finest hour on the screen. His pathetic recollection of his lost wife is acted with subtlety and feeling and proves his metal as an actor.
  Marlon Brando as Major Penderton rises to his role as a closeted homosexual. This is one of his masterworks as an actor and quite possibly one of his best in the 1960's. He is puffy, middle aged and completely without vanity. To watch him struggle to lift a barbell with one arm is delightfully disturbing.
  As Leonora Penderton Elizabeth Taylor is at the top of her game, dumb, sexy and funny. It is one of her most deeply complex performances from a career full of great work. There is so much humor mixed into her character and she goes all the way to reveal the each nuance and layer of Leonora.
  The music by Toshiro Mayuzumi is hauntingly beautiful and atmospheric. The opening theme carries a muted smoky jazz sound that sets the scene perfectly. The only false note in the film are Taylor's costumes by Dorothy Jenkins. Set in the late 1940's Miss Taylor is dressed in the current fashions of the late 1960's and she looks beautiful but out of time with the era along with her hair by Alexandre of Pairs.
  Huston directs with calm assuredness, as he leads is excellent cast to the tragic inevitable end to the film. *****",1087776000,18,1948,4.697058823529412
283438,4,6300268535,"Adapted from the novel of the same name by the Georgian writer Carson McCullers and directed by the great John Huston, REFLECTIONS IN A GOLDEN EYE stars Marlon Brando, an army officer on a military post somewhere in the South, and Elizabeth Taylor as his bored wife. There is a lot going on here. Brando plays a latent homosexual who is being cuckolded right under his nose by another officer Brian Keith who is married to a fragile mental case, Julie Harris. Ms. Harris, who has just cut off her nipples with scissors when the movie begins, is cared by by an effeminate Asian houseboy. Add to this mixture a young soldier (Robert Forster) who has a propensity for riding horses bareback and with a bare backside.
I have seen this movie three or four times now and can never decide if it's me or the movie; but I never get all the parts fitted together. This film certainly is worth watching and has an erotic mystery about it. Elizabeth Taylor repeats a part she had done before of the beautiful Southern woman and does a credible job with her Southern accent. But by far the best thing about this movie is Marlon Brando. He of courses acts in every frame and is perfect as the army officer about ready to go to pot who struggles with his forbidden desires.
I do not remember what kind of reviews this movie received in 1967, but Brando gives one of his best performances here. The critics should have so stated.",1086134400,42,1413,4.48062015503876
283439,2,6300268535,"In theory having Marlon Brando and Elizabeth Tayler co-starring and John Huston directing is suppose to be a good thing.  Three of the most talented people to ever put in their time in the industry, the picture would have to good right?  No, not this time around at least. Theory becomes reality in a lackluster film called Reflections in a Golden Eye.
Brando and Taylor are a married couple named Weldon and Leonora Penderton.  They are living together on a military base in the south where Brando is stationed.  It is quickly established that there is no love left in this marriage.  Leonora enjoys riding horses and meeting up with her lover, Lt. Colonel Langdon(Brian Keith). Langdon is their neighbor and is also in a failing marriage.  His wife, Allison(Julie Harris), is a psychotic, or perhaps manic depressive, who is into self-mutilation and hanging out with her caretaker, Anacleto (Zorro David). Weldon spends his time tending to his duties with an apparent sense of doom.  The only time Leonora and Weldon share is when Lt. Langdon comes over to play cards.  Weldon is aware of the affair, but he does not care because it is strongly implyed that he is a homosexual.  Futhermore he is obsessed with a young private he has seen walking naked through the woods near his home.  At first he trys to fight his feelings toward this man and he goes through all the emotions, disgust, denial, fear, anger, and finally, lust and longing. Leonora is similarly unhappy but has different ways of surpressing her impending sadness. All this makes for a morbid film with an even more morbid ending.
In 1967 this film was probably consided pretty edgey and risque.  By todays standards it is not.  Brando does a good job of expressing Weldon's pent-up homosexual urges, but it gets to the point when the implications become annoying.  Taylor, usually a fine performer, is hammy and does three films worth of over acting.  The pacing of this film is dreadfully slow.  And in the end all that is really said about these characters is that they were all miserable.  I did not enjoy it.",995587200,11,2080,4.752089136490251
283440,5,6300268535,"John Huston made a terrific and underappleciated film about passion and guilt. Elizabeth Taylor gives one of her finest performances along with the terrific Marlon Brando. This is one of the best films ever made yet people at the time of its release did not have the sensitibity for it. It explores the need of people to live a false existance and the need to betray ourselves for the sake of society. The result is a sad, moody film with great acting that will leave you intrigue for days to come. This is not a film for prudes",975715200,19,528,4.3979591836734695

Director John Huston's mesmerizing adaptation of the Carson McCullers novel received poor distribution from Warner Brothers  a supposed embarrassment to be laughed off the screen. On the contrary, ""Reflections in a Golden Eye"" (1967) retains its understated power as a masterful psychodrama. Brando's complex and daring performance as the sexually repressed Captain Penderton reveals the actor at his absolute best  ideally matched by the  superb portrayals of Elizabeth Taylor, Brian Keith and Julie Harris.

Utilizing Aldo Tonti's desaturated, gold-tinted cinematography (restored for this DVD release), Huston lends remarkable depth and haunting beauty to the film's emotional landscape.

283620,5,6300268535,"This film, which some will find weird, strange, fascinating, spellbinding, or just plain incomprehensible, drew some highly positive reviews from some critics as well as some negative reviews from others.  It must said that whatever the case, the film very closely follows the book which Carson McCullars wrote.  McCullars was a noted author and has a prominent place in American Literature, but she takes us into a very strange world here, one that many are unlikely to comprehend or get a ""hold"" on.  There are some very strange and complex characters here and director John Houston has assembled a mighty strong cast to play these characters.  Marlon Brando, Elizabeth Taylor, Julie Harris, and Brian Keith are all at the top of their game here and they succeed in making these unorthodox characters come to life in a fascinating way.  When I read this book in college, I admit that I was mesmerized yet confounded by the ending.  In preparing for my written exam on this book, I re-read the book a second time.  Fortunately, this film was released a short time later and I made it a point to see it.  While watching the film, I was shocked at how close this film followed the book.  When the film reached it's conclusion, the whole thing became very clear, and I considered myself to have had a thrilling film experience.  This is NOT a film for everyone --- a lot of thinking and imagination must be put to work here, and if one is willing to invest the time into it, they will have felt it worth it.",1474848000,,1505,4.602996254681648

He also spends his nights sneaking into Elizabeth Taylor's room while she is sleeping to fondle and sniff her underwear.  Then there is Taylor's hubby Marlon Brando, an officer instructor who is an extremely closeted homosexual.  He develops an unhealthy yen for Forster after he sees him in the buff and decides THIS IS FOR HIM.  There is Brian Keith's wife played by Julie Harris.  She lost it big time by losing her infant daughter after a horrendously difficult birth.  She responds to that tragedy by cutting off her nipples with garden shears.  OOOHH!

Even Taylor is a bit out there.  Her true love is her horse Firebird who is as she puts it, A STALLION.

284017,4,6300268535,"This film is certainly remarkable in John Huston's work : it's the film he made that's overlooked. He was a real director and made some brilliant films. This was controversially shot using a golden filter to reflect the mood and story,however this was changed a week after release to technicolour and was left that way. The DVD shows the initial intentions. Based on Carson McCullers novel,there is no ground-bass of common humanity,the characters are all freaks. We get tiny and grotesque deviations without any interpretations based on universal laws,'reflections in a golden eye'.We don't know why people act as they do,we can only deduce from the actions which arereflections. These exotics are figments of fancy glimpsed in a fire's embers. Sexual repression on an army base in North Carolina. We are given a printed screen at the start that a man was murdered down south.

Within these restrictions the film is beautifully filmed and acted. Brando has never been better,wound up,repressed as an army major,maintaining a faade of 'normalcy'.Hiding confusion,anger and desire,he's constantly fascinating to watch. Both Taylor and Harris are well cast as Brando's and Keith's unhappily married wives,who find solace through different means,one inactively and the other actively through sex. Keith becomes the `everyman' character with a lot of heart. Zorro Davis is indelible as the flamboyant `artistic' Philipino man-servant. Forster in his screen debut,the central voyeur,rides naked,sniffs lingerie and broods,acting like bait for Brando. The ensemble produce a powerful,melodramatic thrust in a drama about sexual identity and fitting square pegs into round holes. The central scene is when Brando rides Taylor's beloved horse unleashing acting of raw emotion. The comedy comes when Taylor regales Harris with all the food and drink she is laying on for the party. The film is headed by the remark:"" An army post in peacetime is a dull place."" Wow!",1379808000,,1956,5.35064935064935
284018,2,6300268535,"Marlon Brando, Elizabeth Taylor, John Huston, sex, violence, marriage, adultery, lust, depression, self-mutilation; pretty much everything you need to make a sultry gothic tale in a glossy package.  Still, with all these assets seemingly in order, there is something sadly amiss about this film.

Brando plays Major Weldon Penderton, a man at odds with his sensual wife Leonora.  He is harboring a deep, dark secret.  He's been sitting on homosexual feelings that have caused him to lash out at his wife, push her away and live in a deep-seated depression.  Leonora isn't waiting around for her husband to satisfy her.  She frolics around with another married man who is dealing with his own disconnect with his wife, who is suffering depression after the death of a child and has actually fallen into self-mutilation.  Weldon becomes attracted to a young Private who is working in the stables with Leonora's horses.  Weldon pulls him out of the stables and into his own backyard, where he keeps a lustful eye on him while the Private turns a lustful eye on Leonora.

The themes presented here are so scattered and none of them really connect themselves in a way that feels fluid.  Instead, it feels like someone tried to throw everything of interest at us in one sitting, and nothing stuck besides some really strong performances.  Taylor, one of my favorites, is strong but is easily uprooted by the performances that surround her.  Brando, Harris and Keith were all Oscar worthy here, especially Brian Keith who handles his final scenes with so much emotional depth.

The intriguing cinematography (the purposeful sepia) doesn't always work and at times becomes a distraction, and the development of homosexual themes is so light that it almost becomes a non-theme and doesn't get the dissection it needed.  I'm sure it had to do with the times, but Brando's powerful portrayal of a man haunted by himself is not enough to bring all the themes of this film together in unity.",1378771200,,1978,4.936555891238671
284019,2,6300268535,"Anyone familiar with director John Huston knows he likes stories about desperate people.  On the surface, the viewer may conclude this work is a break from that theme, but not so.  The six main characters are all unhappy souls desperately clinging to anything that resembles normalcy.  The plot?  Major Penderton works constantly in order to repress his homosexuality, while his wife Leonora starts an affair to fill her sexual appetites.  However, their ""marriage"" is put to the test when a young private becomes obsessed with Leonora.  Now then, Huston does his best to assemble a thought-provoking piece that explores dysfunctional relationships.  Unfortunately, the effort fails in its attempt due largely to the odd sub-plot involving the wife and houseboy of Lt. Col. Langdon.  Too much time is spent on this bizarre relationship since too little is gleaned from those scenes.  An audience doesn't need ten minutes or more to recognize crazy.  Indeed, this picture doesn't want to tell a conventional story, but no work should include extraneous elements that do not advance the plot.  ""Reflections In A Golden Eye"" is a loosely knit psychological drama that unwinds well before the third act.
  COMMENTS:  {SPOILER ALERT}  The ending is particularly disappointing because of the way Huston decides to shoot it.  Major Penderton has just slain Private Williams waking Leonora in the process.  With one continuous shot bouncing between the three characters over and over again, the film goes from a drama to a farce.  Before now, I can only recall observing this see-saw technique in comedies.  After watching this movie however, I think the joke is perhaps on the viewer.",1378080000,,1677,5.16728624535316

If you do know about the golden eye of the peacock you get a sense that you are looking at this film from someone else's eyes.  It's strange and surreal but it keeps you involved with the film.

The greatest actor the cinema has ever seen directed by one of the most legendary filmmakers of all time. Marlon Brando and John Huston have cooked up something wicked with this maddening tale, a southern gothic of the highest order. A slow paced, but incredibly absorbing film. Huston taught the likes of Kubrick and Erice a thing or two with this one. And both Liz Taylor and Robert Forster(in his screen debut) deserve recognition for their work in the film, as does Zorro David... as does as virtually every actor who had a line in the film! On a technical level, this may be the most visually interesting and unpredictable of all of Huston's films, incredible ideas photographed beautifully. Reflections In A Golden Eye is a very unconventional film, and I recommend it only to those who are familiar with the work of Elia Kazan and Victor Erice, as the language of the film is both reminiscent and prophetic of both of them, and watching an auteur film is like learning a new language, in this case Reflections In A Golden Eye would be almost indecipherable to someone who hasn't been exposed to some of the more unconventional films of the late fifties.

The story of Reflections carries you through alienation and repression. Marlon's character is obsessed with a private who is a peeping Tom and likes riding bareback on a mare naked. An intense scene where Brando beats a horse and kills it. When his wife finds out she beats him back with her riding crop. It is all an intense scene. Not for sensitive individuals.

284130,4,6300268535,"A truly strange film about Elizabeth Taylor and Marlon Brando as an army couple stationed down South somewhere.

One hunk of burning man, a private, is a horse lover, and Taylor's lover's wife is a repressed cookie who cuts off her nipples and has a creepy Filipino man-servant slavering for her. Really weird, man, really weird. Should have been on a stage... and probably was!

There's an interesting anecdote about Warren Beatty's film Bonnie and Clyde, which had been given a limited release by the studio but was getting great reviews. When he threatened to sue the studio for giving Reflections of a Golden Eye a wide release, where it stiffed, but not giving one to him, the studio acquiesced - the result was that Bonnie and Clyde was a major hit.

I am relatively new ardent fan of John Huston's work although The Maltese Falcon and Treasure of The Sierra Madre are favorites. This movie reeks of  lurid southern decadence in the tradition of Tennesse Williams(the hyprocrisy of gentility,obsessiveness,and pentup sexual desire all over the place).Reflections is simply a great movie. Experiencing Brando and Taylor together with  their fiery tempers let loose on each other is amazing to watch(no spoilers here).The characters participate in a number of games to hurt each other or to assuage hidden unfulfilled wishes;flirtation,voyeurism,animal abuse,and physical abuse in the form of a public whipping at a party. It's a strong emotional film filled with powerful images of anger. Brando's character kick's his wife in the behind when she is dead drunk,really in a disespectful  way that I have never seen on the screen. Relationships appear to be very unsatisfying between the married couples so that the mood is set for taut drama,perhaps even melodrama.  None of the characters deserve much sympathy and each is hard to connect with.

My eyes popped when the voluptuos and sexy Ms Taylor slowly removed all her garments and revealed all her glory (shot from the back) in a scene where her character defiantly taunted her enraged husband. She's simply fearless in this role. I didn't understand why the young captain had to ride horses bareback and in the nude (how did he get away with it?) However, I do appreciate a naked and good looking young man and I feel that the nudity helped to distract a bit from the overall moodiness and tense atmosphere. If only full frontal of men and women were allowed then! Its great that Brando's sexually closeted husband role was not turned into a creepy gay caricature otherwise it would have completely ruined the film.

Anyway, this is a good movie because of the interesting storyline and good acting from the leads. Go watch it!",1254268800,4,1107,4.6479591836734695
284185,5,6300268535,"This film, even by contemporary standards, is a bit shocking in subject matter. However, since the film was originally made in 1967, it is amazing that the studio, director, and actors were all willing to bring a very difficult story to motion picture screen. John Huston, as a director, has always had that bravery to tackle difficult novels and interpret them in a masterful manner. Beside Carson McCuller's novel, Reflections in a Golden Eye, he also has interpreted Flannery O'Connor's Wiseblood and James Joyce's The Dead, both of which are complex literary masterpieces that would almost defy film-making. But this film is an under-appreciated masterpiece.
However, brave actors at the height of their careers were also willing to participate in a story that was far from mainstream experience. Marlon Brando provides a performance that almost defies description. As a repressed homosexual career Army Major, Brando does an excellent job of interpreting a man barely able to sustain a mask of sanity as homosexual compulsions eventually drives him to rash acts of violence against himself, his wife, her horse, and others. He invites punishment from his wife and then accepts it like a stoic. He often practices social conversations in front of mirrors and yet he is constantly stiff and formal with his associates. He can not escape the life he seems to have built for himself and thus at times is very upset and dispirited.
Elizabeth Taylor is superb in the role of the Major's wife, Leonora. Taylor and the storyline reveal her to be a beautiful spoiled military brat who has married a handsome, masculine, career officer with a repressed secret that undermines their relationship. As a sexually frustrated wife, she meets her sexual needs with an affair that is so open that everyone on the military base knows it is occurring, with the possible exception of Major Weldon Penderton.  Major Penderton may know about her affair with Lt. Colonel Morris Langdon, their next-door neighbor, but he sees it as punishment for his dark secret. Her passions are strong and require more than Colonel Langdon, for she must also direct her anger toward the stoic, handsome, mystery of a husband with whom she has linked her fate. There is a wonderful line where she strips nude in front of her cold husband and then asks him if he has ever been shackled and chained and beat in the street by a naked woman. She also releases some of her pent up passion through horseback riding on her beautiful white stallion, Firebird, an animal that her husband sees as somewhat of a rival.
Some may indicate that this is a dark Southern Gothic tale by a Southern writer. It takes place in a post-World War II army base in Georgia where officers and their wives make use of a stable of horses, maintained by the enlisted men. When riding, there are multiple trails in the southern forest that surrounds the Army base. This forest is especially important in this film for it is here that Leonora and Colonel Langdon frequently go to have sex among the blackberry bushes. It is here that Private Williams, a handsome animal force from nature, rides a black mare nude. It is here that Major Penderton pushes his wife's horse into panic and frenzy in a wild ride of desperation to escape his life condition.
Private Williams is a fascinating character, partly because he only speaks once or twice in the entire film, and yet his actions bring about the crisis of identity for Major Penderton for he becomes the object of male obsession. He is a force of nature drawn to nature and destined to appeal to the nature hidden within others. He is as one with horses and the forest where he takes off his clothes and either rides or naps in the nude. He recognizes in Leonora an animal instinct and animal passion that is unreleased and seething. As a voyeur, he observes Leonora taunt her husband while she is nude, and then sees her husband contemplate a hidden picture of the Apollo Belvedere on a post-card. However, Private Williams has his own secret, for he becomes obsessed with Leonora and enters the Penderton home nightly to watch her sleep and to smell her clothing. Robert Forester plays this role very well for it requires very little dialogue but much facial intensity.
There could also be a Jungian interpretation of Private Williams, for he acts as a shadow archetype for Major Penderton. He nightly enters the home of Penderton (which is the symbol of the psyche) as if the repressed homoeroticism is breaking through the unconscious into consciousness.  Major Penderton has romanticized a world of male warriors and a society of men that Leonora is intuitive enough to recognize as a veiled confession of homoeroticism. But surely such a situation where a Major is sexually obsessed with a handsome Private who in turn comes into their house at night to smell the sexually frustrated wife's underwear is a tragedy and crisis just waiting for explosion.
Julie Harris plays the role of Alison Langdon, the mentally disturbed wife of Colonel Langdon. But as is many classics, she may be mentally ill but she sees all. She sees that her husband is unfaithful and she sees that Private Williams enters the Penderton home on a nightly basis. She is tended to by an effeminate butterfly of a man, Anacleto, who is the houseboy for the Langdons. Alison lost a female child in childbirth and mutilated her nipples afterward in an act of grief and an emotional break from reality.
With a challenging storyline that would highly disturb some viewers, and exceptional performances by some of the most talented actors in film history, the film is further enhanced with excellent cinematography that captures the murky world between the structured army base and the wildness of the surrounding forest.
Much more could be said of this film which is a work of art. Like any work of art, it may require some thought and reflection to begin to mine the multiple meanings that emerge from such a drama, but it is well worth the viewing.",1254009600,9,6009,4.838678328474247

284188,5,6300268535,"John Huston's ""Reflections In A Golden Eye"" is one of his lesser-known works. This overlooked film is a riveting piece of Cinema. He brought together the unlikely combination of Carson McCuller's southern gothic novel along with the talents of Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando, and Julie Harris to create a fascinating study of deceit, lies, and murder.
Julie Harris brings to the project her unique blend of neurosis and pathos. She inhabits the role as Allison the mentally fragile wife of Brian Keith fully, coloring her role with the nuance of madness.
Keith gives his best performance as the philandering husband of Harris and the bumbling lover of Taylor. It is his finest hour on the screen. His pathetic recollection of his lost wife is acted with subtlety and feeling and proves his metal as an actor.
Marlon Brando as Major Penderton rises to his role as a closeted homosexual. This is one of his masterworks as an actor and quite possibly one of his best in the 1960's. He is puffy, middle aged and completely without vanity. To watch him struggle to lift a barbell with one arm is delightfully disturbing.
As Leonora Penderton Elizabeth Taylor is at the top of her game, dumb, sexy and funny. It is one of her most deeply complex performances from a career full of great work. There is so much humor mixed into her character and she goes all the way to reveal the each nuance and layer of Leonora.
The music by Toshiro Mayuzumi is hauntingly beautiful and atmospheric. The opening theme carries a muted smoky jazz sound that sets the scene perfectly. The only false note in the film are Taylor's costumes by Dorothy Jenkins. Set in the late 1940's Miss Taylor is dressed in the current fashions of the late 1960's and she looks beautiful but out of time with the era along with her hair by Alexandre of Pairs.
Huston directs with calm assuredness, as he leads is excellent cast to the tragic inevitable end to the film.

284192,2,6300268535,"John Huston's Reflections in a Golden Eye is like Tennessee Williams rewritten by the Monty Python team for Russ Meyer and directed by Stanley Kubrick as a contractual obligation, with dialogue filled with non sequiters and surreal flights of fantasy, increasingly absurd situations and relationships, all shot with a sepia-tinted color scheme that takes the title way too literally and a solemn, detached look that's worryingly close to implying we're meant to take this all very, very seriously. At other times it's as if Huston decided that the only way to approach such ripe material was to send it up, with Marlon Brando and Elizabeth Taylor competing to see who can come up with tha mows rhidicluss Sahffan accsunt, Marlon drowning any hope of a decent performance in a sea of mannerisms while Liz gives a magnificent display of bad acting inbetween sticking her behind in the air as often as possible as the slut on a hot tin roof.

A tale of stolen spoons, over-zealous yard clearance, horsewhips, repressed desires, murderous passions and a tragic failure to communicate set in an army base where all the square pegs are expected to fit into round holes, it piles absurdity on absurdity as voyeuristic private Robert Forster sneaks into Liz's bedroom to watch her sleep and sniff her clothes, but it's Marlon who really has the hots for him after seeing him riding bareback and naked. But then you know that things are screwed when Julie Harris is the most normal character, and she's performed an act of self-mutilation with the garden shears (""She's alright. She's just neurotic"") and is planning on leaving her husband to run a prawn boat with her ballet-dancing peacock-painting Rachmaninov-obsessed Filipino manservant Anacleto who dreams of boots full of squirming baby mice (Zorro David, dubbed by Bond movie regular Robert Rietty). Traditionally you'd say that it will all end badly, but for anyone without a taste for absurd southern Gothic that goes for the beginning and middle as well.

Warners DVD offers a 2.35:1 widescreen transfer with the original golden tint that was used for the film's first engagements and rapidly withdrawn, but not the more natural colour transfer that was most viewers are familiar with.

284193,4,6300268535,"I am going to direct you to a review in the out-of-print ""Bad Movies We Love"" (seek it out and maybe they will reissue it) as the penultimate statement about this laugh-out-loud classic.  Elizabeth Taylor is married to hopelessly buttoned-up repressed Marlon Brando (in this case BrandMo, complete with Greek statue porn and slatherings of ""rejuvinating cream""), but boinking Brian Keith, who is married to Julie Harris, who had cut her own nipples off with garden shears (!) in reaction to I forget what, but who is served and entertained by her best friend/servant/companion Anacleto, the only person who understands her (completely understandable) desire to get away from this lot of repressed loonies and retire to a prawn trawler.  In the midst of this rolls in hot, hunky (and often nude) Robert Forster, who only wants to ride a horse.  Since half the rest of the cast wants to be ridden by him, that presents a problem.  I won't give anymore away, only to write that this feels like it was something that would have been earth-shattering if it was released in say, 1957.  Ten year later we are thinking this could have gone a lot further and not ended up as the rather dried up affair it is.

Plus side?  Elizabeth is gorgeous, and nearly peels it all off.  Robert Forster is gorgeous, and does peel it all off, and runs around in army drag when he's not nekkid. Grr.

Downside?  Nearly everything else in this unending overlong fever-dream snooze-fest.  If there was any interest in filming anything by Carson McCullers, this killed it",1186704000,5,1544,4.788679245283019
284194,2,6300268535,"If you sit through this strange film to the ending (you should be rewarded for stamina), you are treated to the stupidest camera work you could imagine. It is laughable. The last scene is the dramatic high point, but the director and cinematographer abolutely ruin a moment that could have been decent. If you've seen it, you may agree. It practically screams motion sickness. What a cheap trick.

As for the film itself, it is bizarre. There are a handful of characters who are all in one way or another sad or pathetic or deranged. Marlon Brando gurgles and mumbles his way through the movie (where did he ever get that affectation, that strange manner of speaking? He was fine in ""Streetcar""). Anyway, he plays a closeted military school instructor married to a silly, shrill, vapid broad played by Elizabeth Taylor. She gives me the impression of a washed up and [..] Scarlett O'Hara. We are not told how these two opposites ever got together. Maybe they lost a bet. She refers to him as Prissy, and he calls her a slattern. Both correct, I might add.

Brando's character  is silently obsessed with one of the young military men (who is stalking Brando's wife quietly); Taylor is involved secretly with their friend (Brian Keith), whose depressed wife (Julie Harris) is recovering from a miscarriage and a depression in which she mutilated herself.

A highlight of the film is Julie Harris' Filipino houseboy Anacleto: softspoken, flamboyant, odd, and oh so dramatic. His scenes are fascinating and comical.

The movie originally was filmed with some odd gold wash that permeates it, but this was removed when audiences didn't care for it. I've seen that version and the second (regular Technicolor); I prefer the latter. To paint everything in a light amber hue is tedious, no matter what John Huston was going for. The movie's surreal enough without the tint.
When I think of the cast in this film, sadly, they are wasted. Even megastars can't save the heavy, boring material. Yes, Taylor and Brando are good (they are great actors, no doubt). But these characters aren't likeable people, any of them.
Sadly, Reflections in a Golden Eye does not give us much to like. I'd skip it. You're not missing much of anything.",1181779200,9,2223,4.824146981627297
284245,3,6300268535,"John Huston's REFLECTIONS IN A GOLDEN EYE, adapted from the acclaimed novel by Carson McCullers, is a bizarre film indeed.  The main draw, of course, is the pairing of the two greatest actors in screen history, Marlon Brando and Elizabeth Taylor.  How odd, then, that the film itself overshadows them!  The film is set at a military post: Brando is Major Penderton, who fights his own secret homosexuality; Taylor is his nymphomaniac wife, Leonora, who is having an affair with Lt. Colonel Langdon (Brian Keith).  Langdon's wife, Alice (Julie Harris), recently had a failed pregnancy, after which she cut off her nipples with garden shears.  And Robert Forster makes his film debut as a young enlisted man who enjoys riding horses naked and who observes the curious interactions of the Pendertons.

Sound odd?  Believe me, it is.  To add to the weirdness, director Huston printed the film with a golden tint, which adds a sort of nautious quality to the whole thing.  Brando and Taylor are the glue that holds the film together.  Taylor is a delight, but Brando gives a somewhat lacking performance.  Forster, however, is great, as is Harris and Zorro David as her wacky Asian servant.  As I haven't read the novel on which the film is based, I can't comment on how faithful the film is nor on which is better, but I fully intend to read the novel after viewing the film.  It isn't bad, in fact it's far from it, but it's not really good either.  In the end, it's a film one won't necessarily regret seeing, but it seems like a waste of Brando's talent, and that really detracts from the film, but if you've a taste for the bizarre, give it a shot.",1172188800,8,1648,4.618556701030927
284246,3,6300268535,"The time is late 1948 and the setting is a U.S. Army post in Georgia, bordering on a forest preserve...

A Southern amoral wife called Leonora (Elizabeth Taylor) finds an outlet for her vital nature in an adulterous affair with Lt. Col. Langdon (Brian Keith), carried on almost openly...

Leonora gives aperture to her forcefulness and vigor in a passion for horses and riding... She is attached to a handsome white horse she calls Firebird and she provokes her husband by telling him that the animal is indeed a stallion and a beast with the soul of a gentleman...

Leonora's husband (Marlon Brando) is a devious, insecure, impotent Army major, a hidden homosexual preoccupied with an unsociable, lonely rider who canters around the field in the nude and whose sexual tension is released, secretively, at the bedside of the major's wife fondling her clothes and staring at her...

Private Williams (Robert Forster) is another lonely man fascinated by the fiery Leonora and her occasional kind comments to him... He takes to visiting the Penderton house at night and looking attentively in the windows... He observes Leonora in the nude, but he also watches the Major in his study...

Keith's neurotic wife (Julie Harris) is well aware of her husband's affair with Leonora but she only feels well from her close friendship with her houseboy, Anacleto (Zorro David), an effete companion who shares her penchant for the arts and is in every way the opposite of her abrupt, strong husband...

Liz few scenes with Brando crack1e with sexual antagonism... He's a tormented human being while she's delicious but shrill and insensitive... Aware of her physical beauty she fights back when she's rejected, provoking him with her impertinent, impudent manners that offend his very being...

Flavored with bitter insinuations and hot sarcasms, their scenes have enough flames to burn the silver screen...

As Brando's character implies, in an introspective monologue, the plot set-up consists entirely of square pegs in round holes, and the lack of communication and emotional empathy between the characters is almost total. As a work of art, it is superb, with very fine performances from all concerned, perhaps especially John Huston. But I would be immensely surprised if it did anything at all at the box-office. Presumably the simple-minded studio suits reckoned that star names, Brando and Taylor, with ace director Huston, would be enough to rake in the dollars. Boy, did they get less than they bargained for. The tale is extremely depressing, but powerful and disturbing. It must also be almost unique in having a key character who doesn't speak a single line. The motivations of each of the entire ensemble are almost impenetrable, but I suppose they all find themselves caught inside the rigid grid of the military, with no means of escape. A very good film, generating an almost surreal atmosphere.",1166054400,7,1095,5.157303370786517
284249,4,6300268535,"""One of a kind"" is a somewhat inadequate phrase to describe John Huston's 1967 Southern Gothic about sexual repression, homophobia, and insanity in an army fort. The plot of the film is so bizarre as to be stupefying. Marlon Brando plays a grotesquely closeted army major who teaches war strategy at a Southern military school, while his silly wife (Elizabeth Taylor) engages in a causal affair with the colonel next door (Brian Keith), whose wife (Julie Harris) spends her days in a darkened room being entertained by her Filipino houseboy while she recovers from her breakdown after the death of her infant daughter... during which she cut off her nipples with gardening shears. (As Anna Russell used to say, I am not making this up, you know.) Meanwhile, Brando stalks a handsome enlisted man at the fort (Robert Forster), who sneaks in to Taylor's bedroom late at night to spy on her while she sleeps, and who also loves to ride the base's horses in the nude. Ouch!

All this sounds pretty ridiculous, but through the terrific use of cinematography and pacing to convey the heady, dreamy atmosphere of the fort in late summer, Huston somehow makes it all work. The film is pretty suspenseful--you know someone's going to be murdered from the film's opening title but you don't know who or why or by whom, and the suspense keeps you guessing until the end (where Huston unfortunately undoes most of what he's accomplished before by a ludicrous repeated pan back-and-forth of the killer, the corpse, and the figure in between them). The film was originally released in an unusual gold wash that was replaced with standard Technicolor one week into the film's release after poor box office results, but as you can imagine from the description nothing could have saved this odd neither-fish-nor-fowl movie in commercial terms. This recent DVD release restores the original tints, but they are not quite as beautiful as they have been legendarily reputed to be over the decades: they impart a muddy wash to some scenes that makes it difficult to discern details in the complex and crowded compositions onscreen. I was more impressed with the film visually--perhaps heretically so--when I first saw it in standard Technicolor years ago at a repertory film theatre in Cambridge, MA. Despite this disappointment, I still felt the film's unique conveyance of atmosphere and appreciated its fine performances, particularly from Brian Keith as the confused and likeable husband of Harris.",1165622400,66,2481,5.021844660194175

It is dark and yet funny since almost everyone in it has some bizarre behavior at some point. The acting is top notch, though I wasn't crazy about the ending. I would at least see it once if you haven't already.

According to Montgomery Clift's biographer, Clift was set to play the role of Major Pemberton but ended up having a heart attack and dying before the filming could begin. Liz Taylor and he were very close friends. Marlon Brando reluctantly but eventually took the role. And does a great job!

284251,5,6300268535,"Reflections in a Golden Eye is a film based on the Carson McCullers novel of the same name. It surrounds the lives of Major Penderton (Brando) a repressed homosexual married to an unsympathetic, emasculating woman-Lenora (Liz Taylor), who is having an affair with Lt. Langdon whose wife Alision, has descended into self-mutilation-cutting off her nipples with garden shears-unable to come to terms with the loss of her child. As the movie begins the audience is greeted with an eerie musical score and is introduced to Private Williams a loner who seems to have a predilection for horses-among other things.

Major Penderton is aware of the affair between his wife and Lt. Langdon but is unconcerned. His wife Lenora taunts him constantly, making fun of his viriliy-or lack thereof, and even calls him ""prissy"" one night after he tells her she ""looks like a slattern"" (a slob) and that she disgusts him. In response, she disrobes and silently taunts him. After which he suddenly breaks down and threatens her.  At this, she inquires if he'd ever been thrashed by a naked woman-knowing that she is fully capable of causing him bodily harm, his body grows limp in defeat.

On one occasion Major Penderton joins his wife and Lt. Langdon on a horseback ride in the woods where they encounter Private Williams riding horseback nude. Lenora and Langdon find it amusing and impressive, while Major Penderton is both appalled and fascinated. Throughout, we see Major Penderton try to prove his manhood by barking out orders to subordinates, depriving Capt. Weincheck, a man who enjoys listening to classical music and playing the violin (something which is vaguely interpreted as homosexual) of a good evaluation on his efficiency report, and attempting to ride his wife's horse Firebird whom she describes as a ""stallion"" (another of his wife's taunts at his inadequacy as a man). After a feeble attempt at riding the horse, he beats the horse in anger and frustration-the look on Brando's face in this moment causes one to pity not only the horse but Major Penderton also-he becomes hysterical-it is as if he is laughing and crying at the same time. Of course his wife finds out about the incident and proceeds to beat Penderton about the face with her whip, in front of their guests-and all the while he stands-almost like a statue accepting the beating.

Eventually, Penderton becomes obsessed with Private Williams who seems to enjoy not only nude horseback riding but nude sunbathing in the woods and nude nature walks as well. Over time, Penderton grows in his obsession of Private Williams- stalking him, picking up a candy wrapper he has thrown on the ground. Seemingly, the Private is aware of Penderton's fascination and at times seems to play along.

In the finale, Penderton peers out of his window and finds Private Williams lurking around his home-he believes the Private is coming to see him-not knowing that the Private has been breaking into his home each night carrying out his strange fetishes with Penderton's wife. Probably one of the best scenes in the movie is when Brando improvises-primping himself by combing down his hair to prepare for what he perceives is the Private's visit. Tragic events will soon follow.

At the same time all these things are occuring, Lt. Langdon's wife is being cared for (mothered) and entertained by their VERY flamboyant Filipino house boy Anacleto, portrayed by Zorro David, a beautician and painter making his first and only screen appearance. On one occasion he paints a peacock with a golden eye, and explains that the peacock's golden eye sees clearly those things that are tiny and grotesque-hence the title of the book and film.

There is so many things going on in this movie that it could easily become the subject of a doctoral thesis. Brando gives a very brave and daring performance. It is the MOST underrated performance of his career and is truly one of his finest. His performance in this film deserves to be counted amongst his best. Liz Taylor is great playing her Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf characterization. Both Brain Keith and Juile Harris provide great support. Robert Forster makes an unusual screen debut as Private Williams. And Zorro David, the flamboyant Filipino house boy is indeed comical and extremely over the top-making a film with such a dark subject matter feel almost as if it were a dark comedy. At times I felt he needed to have been reeled in by director John Huston because he was so over the top. When this film debuted it sharply divided audiences and critics alike. And it's no wonder why-it is both bizarre and grotesque but also brilliant. Oftentimes I wondered if I were watching a thriller/horror film instead of a drama-because there were so many scenes in this film that were simply chilling.

Sadly, I don't know if this film will ever overcome the stigma attached to it. It is indeed a very strange film and not for everyone, but it is a brilliant film illustrating how perversion in society can happen in any setting-even in the most conformist and pristine and amongst the most unlikely of people.",1124755200,40,5102,4.8969907407407405
