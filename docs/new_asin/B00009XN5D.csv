8577524,4,B00009XN5D,"i'm an avid urban film collector and i usually buy off list items. i just got my copy of ""thugs got game"" and i must say that it first looked as if it was gonna be another first person shooter movie. hip-hop vs r&b type thing but, i was wrong and i admit that after my 4th time watching it i'm starting to understand the idea of the film..i thought it could have taken a better look at the bad guys roll and how he came up, also maybe a little more tension between the mob boss and the drug dealer..i must say i never heard the word man used more than 50 times in a movie since link from ""mod squad"" who ever that guy was he should think of other words but all in all i had a pretty good time watching it i even show it to my friends in film class..i'm enrolled at baylor university and the film class here loves the indie's. please make more of them and keep them comming..peace.. oh and by the way the light skin chick was hotttttttttt!!!!",1061510400,,941,4.037433155080214

Thugs Got Game looks good, and it has an interesting story.  The soundtrack is excellent, probably the best part of the movie.  Sounds like dirty south hip hop by some group called Born Fusion.  Theres a few places where the movie kind of gets off track, but the two main actors are good, the story is solid, and it has a visual quality lacking in a lot of urban movies that come out these days.  I liked the story a lot, mainly because it felt real.  It wasn't about high priced gangsters wearing lots of gold.  It was about two very real people and the problems they face living on the street.  Good stuff.",1058140800,,750,4.3
