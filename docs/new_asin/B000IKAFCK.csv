8146021,5,B000IKAFCK,Great basic information about an incredibly intelligent and noble woman.  The kids loved learning about Marie Curie.  The information was informative enough for my 10 year old and presented nicely in story format to keep my 7 year old and 4 year old engaged.  My 7 year old especially enjoyed challenging himself with the quiz questions at the end.  We love these Animated Hero Classics and hope to continue adding to our collection of them.,1415836800,,441,4.84
