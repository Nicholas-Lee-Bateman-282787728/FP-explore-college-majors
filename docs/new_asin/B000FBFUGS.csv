8120194,4,B000FBFUGS,Good flick.,1455148800,,11,5.0
8120195,5,B000FBFUGS,"Gundam seed is one of the more modernized Gundam entries. The 2 previous shows, Gundam wing and 08th MS Team were pretty good. Gundam Wing had okay animation, but the voice cast was bad on the english dub. 08th MS Team has ok voice acting, but the animation was kind rough. Gundam Seed has neither of these problems. It has really good animation and pretty good voice acting. The soundtrack is also really well done. The story is also more interesting. There are some major plot twists and some great conflicts between the characters. It definitely deserves the 2 seasons that it ran. With lots of great characters, a pretty in depth plot and high quality production it's definitely my favorite Gundam since the original. You should give it a chance. I hope you like it as much as I do.",1355356800,,786,4.581560283687943
8120196,5,B000FBFUGS,Im so glad to see they have finally devoted the proper ammount of time to translating an anime. I watched the Jap version 6 months ago and the english is far superior.,1156809600,,167,4.25
8120197,5,B000FBFUGS,"This is the best SEED Destiny set i have seen so far.  It is awesome to see the freedom take it out on the bad guys, and I still cannot believe that they had a gundam interrupt a wedding.  Quite possible one of the best series i have seen so far.",1156636800,,246,3.803921568627451
8120198,3,B000FBFUGS,"Well, I anticipated the release of Vol3, and I must be frank, I''m disappointed.

While it does contain one of my favorite episodes, in which new protagonist Shinn, alone and armed with only his Sword Impulse's two AntiShip Swords, destroys six enemy warships, two of them carriers, in thirty-odd seconds, something his predecessor never even came close to doing, It perpetuates the previous volumes' mediocre bonus features, and worse of all, it has only 4 episodes, instead of the usual 5. Dunno why that is.

Having said that, it's still a great buy, from what started out as a great series.

If you're a Gundam buff, then I say pick it up. Definitely.",1155600000,,655,4.778761061946903
8120199,5,B000FBFUGS,"Well, finally got my hands on Vol 3.  I waited to see the conclusions from Vol 2.  Vol 3 has some great high points and low points.  There were two that stood out.  One was when Shin uses his Destiny Seed for the first time without knowing how he did it.  The second one is where Kira spoils the wedding of that stupid guy and having a bonus of Archangel in action again...  Can't wait for VOL 4!!!",1153872000,2,398,4.038461538461538
8120200,4,B000FBFUGS,"After receiving an ominous warning from the ""Desert Tiger"" (who was thought to have died in Africa during the previous war), the ZAFT vessel Minerva departs from Orb, whose new alliance with Earth Forces threatens their wellbeing. Although opposed by Cagalli, she is quickly rendered powerless by a cabinet fearful of another war reaching Orb soil, as well as the treacherous Yuna Roma, who demands marriage in order to present a ""unified"" government to the people. Reluctantly and with tears in her eyes, Cagalli agrees.

However, as soon as the Minerva leaves Orb territory, Captain Gladys and her crew find themselves surrounded and trapped - with Orb Defense Fleets at their rear and Earth forces charging toward them, the young pilots must force themselves into yet another battle. However, when a new, powerful mobile unit appears and heavily damages Shinn's Impulse, the young warrior must find his true power and unleash his ""Seed"" in order to save his friends.

Meanwhile, on the PLANTs, Athrun has a brief reunion with his former comrades, Yzak and Dearka. After much thought and deliberation, Athrun finally accepts Chairman Dulindal's offer, becoming the pilot of the new Gundam Savior, as well as being appointed to ZAFT's special forces unit ""F.A.I.T.H.""

(Fast Acting Integrated Tactical Headquarters). Athrun then returns to Earth, once again joining the Minerva.

Also in Volume 3, the seemingly exiled home of Kira Yamato, Lacus Clyne, Murrue Ramius, and Andrew Waltfield is suddenly attacked by a squad of Coordinator Special Forces, whose sole objective is to assassinate Lacus. Faced with a new, unknown enemy, Kira accepts his inevitable fate and once again steps into the cockpit of his Gundam Freedom - as the legendary Archangel is about to be re-enter service.

Although Gundam Seed Destiny has only just began, the enveloping storyline is very skilled in grasping the viewer's attention. With more turns and twists than ever, the next phase of the Gundam Franchise promises to be spectacular, suspenseful, and stunning. As the series reveals, nothing is as it seems - and in the Gundam tradition, no matter how massive the explosion, pilots can always survive - so watch out for sudden re-appearances and shocking revelations as the series continues!",1151625600,5,2277,5.193460490463215
