8336718,3,B001QWFTUM,"I was disappointed that this was on Walking Between the Worlds since I bought both.  If you have read Gregg Braden's books, you know what he tells us on these DVDs.  Gregg Braden needs to practice what he preaches and get over the girl that did him wrong many years ago, we keep hearing about her and his business partner that also did him wrong.",1405296000,,346,4.3076923076923075

8336721,2,B001QWFTUM,"I have learned so much through reading and listening to Gregg Braden, but this DVD was simply not entirely my cup-of-tea. It was recorded years ago, which is not in the description of the product, and I was disapointed. Additionally, some of the sudject matter is something I will have to seriously ponder.",1361404800,,306,4.7924528301886795
8336722,4,B001QWFTUM,"I have to admit it...I'm a Gregg Braden junkie.  As usual, he's clear, concise and entertaining in his presentation.  I've seen better from him but if you like Gregg, you'll probably like this.",1354060800,3,193,4.818181818181818
8336723,5,B001QWFTUM,"Gregg Braden brings a solid scientific background to bear, dispelling the confusion that has plagued many who found it difficult to bridge the inconsistencies in religious teachings. Those who wonder at the diverse conclusions derived by the many ""Christian"" religions using one and the same text, thus leading to distrust and even to rejection of Christianity by many, find in Braden's work a direct connection between inner spiritual feelings and the scientific majesty of the Universe as a holographic unity to which we all--animate and inanimate--are inextricably linked. As a result of this intrinsic connection, the present convergence toward critical points as natural earth changes progress, become an opportunity for humanity to get in tune with this progress to help shape the outcome. Personally, I feel that there are no atheists, only persons who reject the concept of an anthropomorphic being who judges the world and our actions. I find it very refreshing that he does not burden his readers with his opinion of what we as individuals should do, how we should behave or not behave; which guided meditation we should implement to affect the outcome; what ancient civilization should educate us how to avoid the same fate as they. He lays out plausible examples of how the universe works, and suggests to the reader/viewer/listener how feelings become the trigger for successful outcomes. To learn scientific proof that we are ONE with the angels, the masters, the Creator Him/Her/Itself,  puts the responsibility right where it belongs--in the heart of each one individually and collectively.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gregg-Braden-Beyond-Zero-Point-The-Journey-to-Compassion/dp/B001QWFTUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gregg Braden: Beyond Zero Point - The Journey to Compassion</a>",1296000000,19,1837,5.880149812734082
