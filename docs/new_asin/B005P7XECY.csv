4856465,1,B005P7XECY,"This is by far the stupidest movie I have ever watched. About an hour and fifteen into it now and it looks like the two chicks are fixing to make out... Nope, not going to happen. Crappy special effects, crappy acting, crappy plot. The story goes in five different directions. Oh yeah, there's a long haired cowboy dude that was a murderer before the invasion went down, now he's a good guy, but I don't think he's the same guy on the box. Not really sure that his role is.. OH THE CHICKS FINALLY MADE OUT!! It's a good movie after all.  NOT!!

If you have nothing better to do in the middle of the week and you've seen everything Red Box has to offer, it's worth a buck to see it. One buck, one star.",1323302400,20,701,4.147058823529412
4856466,1,B005P7XECY,"None of these Phase 4 horror DVD/Blu-ray releases provide optional English subtitles:

Absentia
Forget Me Not
Midnight Movie
... and many more...

None of these titles in the Fangoria Frightfest collection (also from Phase 4 Films) provide English subtitles (EXCEPT The Haunting, which is in Spanish with English subtitles):

Dark House
The Tomb
Road Kill
Pig Hunt
Fragile
Grimm Love

Now that I've gotten that off my back...

After lengthy searching for information about Phase 4 Films, I discovered that Alien Armageddon had optional English subtitles so I got Alien Armageddon.

To those who have seen this movie, do you think it could have been any more bizarre? Every line is a real howler. The special effects are startling.

Alien Armageddon is probably one of the damnest things I have *ever* seen. And if you have seen the movie and agree, try watching some of it with NO SOUND and just READ the SUBTITLES.

Every absurd line of dialogue is followed by an equally absurd response. It is an unbelievable wonderment to behold.

I'm not saying that Alien Armageddon is bad (okay, okay, it IS bad), but I've never seen anything like it.

Sample a bit of it somewhere via YouTube or something and get back to me as soon as you get out of the nice sanitarium your loved ones put you in after you watched Alien Armageddon - despite all the warnings.

C'mon. I dare you to turn the sound off and just read your way through this movie.

Thank you. I need some emotional support right about now. I don't know what rating to give it. Help.

4856467,3,B005P7XECY,"This film had some decent special effects for an indie film. The plot was okay. The acting was definitely B- or C.

The best dialogue/scene in the movie is when a blonde woman is describing life outside the walled-off LA....
Blonde Woman: ""....then he was broadcasting on his spam radio...""
Brunette Woman: ""Ham radio"" (correcting the blonde woman)
Blonde Woman: Just rolls her eyes and goes on talking.

It has some unusual concepts and was NOT what I was expecting.  Pleasantly surprised for a low budget film.  Better than the Asylum films that are made without any heart and soul.",1323129600,4,379,4.385714285714286

THIS IS NOT ""Battle: Los Angeles"" or a sequel to same (even though its tagline does).

4856471,2,B005P7XECY,"I normally do not write reviews for movies where the obvious expectations are low budget silliness.
However, I enjoyed this movie's new spin on alien invasion. Here the concept is brilliant: aliens
, whom are vaguely hinted to have seeded the earth with humans, have returned to harvest their food (us). When you think of it this scenario makes the most sense of all the various alien invasion found in movies today.

The most popular of this are invasions were huge barbaric insects capable of interstellar travel come to enslave us or take resources. Those plots make as much sense as Bill Gates flying  his private jet to a Trailer Park Community in West Virginia and trying to enslave the local population into making computers and software. Said and done, there is only one burgeoning resource in this Solar System worth the hassle and expense of Interstellar Travel: Human
Meat.

Any alien race running low on food will find plenty of people here to munch on and, according to this movie, they will also find it really easy to genetically modify humans to breed more food in mass.

In Alien Armageddon the aliens are gooey phallic worms come here to possess our bodies and to eat us. This is literally the entire plot of this simple and silly story but nevertheless there is an entertaining and unique concept behind it.

Praise aside, the story is poorly told and the film editing and effects were done on a Windows 95 computer. No joking there.

There is also no main character for us to follow or relate to. The movie makes everyone disposable especially women. Lots of tough female characters (played by double D toting Playboy mansion retirees) appear for their minute of screen time and then die off quickly. It happens so often that I think the movie is making a point of sarcasm against heroines.

There is also no real climax to speak of other than the moment the two remaining female lead opposing characters decide to work together, make up to become BFFs and then these two women, against the run of script, start kissing and make out. huh?

Many lazy watchers won't realize it but 90% of this movie was clearly filmed in someone's basement apartment and complex stairwell. No joke. Then there is a bunch or driving around scenes thru retired old westerns movie sets that is being passed off for the USA after the Armageddon. The movie earned a star for the original spin on invasions but also earns a second
star for one of the squirmiest scenes I've seen in a longtime. Human women
blinded and bred like factory cattle, or rather Hens, to birth out pieces of
chunky meat that is fed unknowingly to other enslaved humans. That was one of the best scenes in this movie and a very bold interpretation of the themes used in the Soylent Green and Cloud Atlas movies. Also that scene says a lot about our own livestock industry practices and ignorance regarding genetically modified farm animals specially bred for the sole purpose of feeding humans.",1359072000,3,2964,4.7084942084942085
4856472,3,B005P7XECY,"Having watched Alien Armageddon, I just want to say that I think it's a heartfelt film full of inventive special effects and big scope for a low-budget film.  Having read the other reviews I want to point out that it's grossly unfair to compare this film with other movies that cost over $100 million.  Neil Johnson doesn't have those kind of budgets, but he does have imagination and enthusiasm -- something in short supply when you compare it to the soul-less dreck companies like Asylum are cynically churning out.  I fully support what this filmmaker is doing, found the movie entertaining and imaginative, and look forward to what he does next.",1353628800,2,649,4.828828828828829
4856473,1,B005P7XECY,"It's not too often I get to sit through two turkeys like Blood Rayne:The Third Reich and Alien Armageddon(released July/11),all within a span of just two weeks. The movie gods must be displeased or something. It is with a decided displeasure that I watched it,and a decided pleasure that I survived the experience. It was close though,let me tell you. The creators must have been sitting around watching and playing one too many FPS video games and obviously listening to George Noory's Coast to Coast midnight radio show,to get some of their ideas from. One of them is the main thrust of this DVD,and that is the non-canon religious tome of the Book of Enoch. It is oft cited as a piece of the puzzle for the argument for ancient aliens visiting earth,therein specifically described as the Nephilim race. They apparently ruled the Earth at one time,but were either eventually destroyed or left the planet,so goes the theory anyways.
Fast forward to our little movie here and aliens have invaded the earth. Christopher Lee,lending a bit of credibility to this sad,sad filmic experience(not NEARLY enough though),opens the picture,and ends it,with his voice over,explaining the aforementioned Nephilim,who have returned to take possession of their territory. Most of the Earth is destroyed but L.A. remains one of the last havens for human rebellion.
The case study here involves two separate characters,Katharine McEwan as Jodie Elliot who runs a store and a cowboy,the man with no name apparently,played by Don Scribner. The cowboy was a prisoner/murderer who escapes once things start going south,alien wise and Jodie at first groups up with two other women in a small hideout. Eventually Jodie gets captured and is thrown into a holding cell with two other men. The cowboy meanwhile is busy roaming the countryside shooting up aliens anywhere and everywhere he can;alien scout craft are no problem,and with just a six gun at that! He meets up with others from a resistance group,but he is also captured in a firefight and also ends up with Jodie,down the line.
As the film winds along we find out how long the aliens have been here,they use worm-like lower end Nephilim to inhabit human hosts and learn to adjust to their senses and sensibilities,they are using a virus in the ""food"" they feed prisoners to turn them into something the aliens can literally eat alive(as the DNA of the ""meal"" must match that of the Nephilim otherwise they get tummy aches,the poor things),and the only prisoners they take are those with AB negative blood(not sure why).
The prisoners get fed out of buckets,one with water and the other with some kind of round wet,fish like substance. The prisoners who eat it eventually die. Jodie at one point escapes and learns the totally bizarro origin of the food she eats. She finds a human woman on a table,apparently pregnant(from the sounds,the room is filled with others like her).One thinks she is about to give birth but when the urge comes ,she gives out with what looks like round loaves of wet bread;the very stuff the prisoners have been getting to eat!!(hope you weren't eating).
Time goes on and Jodie herself finally is the last one to get ill. The cowboy finally goes to the last roundup and Jodie has a plan to escape with a woman who was working with the aliens in the beginning and now is a prisoner. She was a scientist and she is an alien herself;one infested years before. She becomes sympathetic with the human cause and both her and Jodie escape,the two falling in love along the way(I guess freedom has a way of doing that).She turns Jodie into a biological weapon against the Nephilim and they deliberately get recaptured at Nephilim headquarters. The Nephilim dine on their new""meal"" Jodie and the infection starts to kill the aliens slow but surely. As the film thankfully ends,the aliens are on the run and the humans are slowly regaining control of the planet.
Phew. If some of that description baffled you,think what it did for me! You know,it wasn't the acting that got me so much(though it was nothing to write home about),as the extremely poor production values and the sub par CGI effects. If any of you have seen They Call me Bruce(and I highly recommended you do!),there is a part where star Bruce Campbell is shooting an alien movie and these cheesy actors and aliens in costumes start shooting at each other with the cruddiest effects you have ever seen. What passes for a send up and funny there is supposed to be for real and serious here,but sorry to say it's just plain cheesy stuff. Floating alien craft are either done with basic 10 year old-on-a-computer stuff,or with trick shots. When either an alien or human get killed,blood spatters appear on the screen;now there's that video game influence in there for sure;trouble is it looks better in Serious Sam and/or Duke Nukem. And one of the trademarks of a total wipe out of a film like this,is someone always comes up with an idea guaranteed to gross out the watcher,somewhere along the line. If there was an award for the grossest scene in a film ever,the pregnant humans spewing out food for the prisoners would take the top award away for sure. Yuck-ville.
Technically speaking the film is in a w/s a/r of 1:78:1. The film looks clear and crisp in bright light but anything darker reveals alot of grain. Extras include,for the masochistic among you,a featurette,a music video(yes,they actually thought it needed a music vid-who'd have thought,or cared?),deleted and extended scenes and the trailer.
All in all,this obviously indie,small budget production film is a loser,from its sorry beginnings to its final and thankful(and too long coming)fade out. Christopher Lee probably got a decent wage packet for his narration,even George Noory the host of Coast to Coast radio has a brief bit of vocalizing,but nothing short of a miracle would have saved this turkey from being the Christmas bird to end all birds,it was.",1348617600,2,5940,4.8821782178217825

4856476,4,B005P7XECY,"I think everyone expects too much these days.  When they DO get a decent film out of some small studio, they gripe and give it a star or two and tell everyone to save time and money.  I think the paucity of ANY SciFi that isn't just some alien making a big bloody mess of humans until they fight back and kill it is what we deserve if that is how we all act.  Sure, this is one of those invasion shows, and sure we fight back etc but it is how it is laid out and shown us that made this worth watching to me.  I admit, without seeing all of the other shows in this series, it lacked a lot of the back story but they gave us enough to know what was up as far as I was concerned.

I watched this movie right to the end and even decided it was worth checking out he other four in the series.  It is pretty well done, I have an HD TV, this was in HD (on Netflix) and so I can say without doubt that the effects were really well done, even though they didn't have buckets of money.  I am not saying they could have been better with buckets of money, I am saying I was satisfied with what I saw, right there with the effects of a film like District 9.

There is no doubt this is a ""B"" movie with a ""B"" movie's budget & actors.  What was different for a change was these folks did as much as they could with what they had and made a pretty good movie despite the obstacles.  If we as a Science Fiction viewing public want to see more science fiction come out of the mainstream that isn't just a slasher movie on an alien planet, then frankly we need to support the better movies the smaller studios give us when they come out.  I know what crap looks like, I have sat through enough crappy movies to know the difference and this one wasn't crap.  It was a step in the right direction, in fact one of the more promising ones I have seen in a good long while.  You get what you deserve folks, keep that in mind when you support the next Big Slasher comes to Alientown show.",1338163200,2,1964,3.954314720812183

4856482,1,B005P7XECY,"The cover art on the box is very misleading. One might think from seeing the grapic on the cover, that this movie is related to the film ""Battle: Los Angeles"". If you are expecting to see a sequel to that film, put this one down and run away, as quickly as you can, in the other direction. Do not, under any circumstances, pay 26 dollars for this movie. If you want to waste 26 dollars on a bad Sci-Fi film, use the money to make a bad Sci-Fi film of your own. I'm sure the makers of ""Alien Armageddon"" spent at least that much. Better yet, take the 26 dollars and buy your children some action figures, and then watch them play. At the very least, the acting will be far superior to anything you see in the movie.

After seeing ""Alien Armageddon"" one might be tempted to say something like ""What were they thinking?"" Wondering what the filmmakers were thinking is very generous, because it presupposes that there was, in fact, some thought devoted to the making of this cinematic abomination.

I'll skip past the special effects, because I can forgive bad special effects if the story is compelling. (See ""Enemy Mine"" for a film with awful special effects that works because the story is interesting.)There are also high-budget films with amazing effects that are almost completely unwatchable (Transformers II comes to mind.)

The real horror of this piece is the screenplay. Once again, calling the loose story guideline a ""screenplay"" is just about as generous as one could be. The dialog makes it nearly impossible to tell if the producers were able to hire actual actors or simply rented out adult film entertainers during their lunch breaks. One notable exception was Katherine McEwan, who did her level best to breathe life into the script. Poor thing...it must have been like trying to make furniture out of sawdust.

Whatever interesting ideas might be lurking around in the script were cleverly concealed in glib dialog, plodding action scenes, and some fairly hilarious attempts at character development.

4856485,2,B005P7XECY,"I include some plot explanations which some people consider spoilers, but not the ending. Considering the film, it is hard to spoil a movie of this caliber. For you Neil Johnson fan(s), this movie is the prequel to Humanity's End. The film runs with a few subplots and is not really that hard to follow. The premise of the film is based on the biblical tale of the Watchers (Angels) who breed with humanity to produce the Nephilim. They were a race of giants (not giants in this film) who were destroyed in the Great Flood.

Don Scribner is about the finest actor in this film, so keep the expectations low. Of course it doesn't help that Neil Johnson, who by no coincidence also wrote the script, didn't write one decent line for the actors. The aliens come to earth and gas the cities and shoot people with guns that cause bodies to explode (the cool part.) The gun nozzle flames was noticeably CG generated, but they did manage to match the gun sounds with the flames- kudos to your behind the scenes people.

I liked the fact that the goof balls at ""Coast to Coast AM"" are broadcasting for people to resist, but were later toasted. People with AB negative blood are spared, (apparently something the aliens can sense) so they can be used in DNA experiments. Don Scribner plays someone who was in prison for killing a bus load of people...later we find out he really wasn't a psychotic killer after all. Katharine McEwan is our Jewish female hero, if you recall this was a biblical story where Jewish women were defiled by angels with matching human DNA...(hint!)

The people exploding on screen looked like a CG special effect.

The aliens set up base in LA, the last remaining city and build a fortress around it. There are groups of pocket resistance that exist outside. Too much of the film takes place in a prison cell, where we get to experience the disgusting effect of having only one open toilet.

The deleted and extended scenes add some explanation to the film such as, ""What was the relationship of the disconnected father-daughter scenes to the main characters."" There is a prison love scene with Katherine McEwan that takes place, which counters her near lesbian scene we have later. We also have an introduction scene of the 2 human scientist who were aiding the aliens, who likewise just pop on the screen.

If they needed to cut film they could have taken out some of the toilet scenes and replaced them with ones that helped with story continuity. Poor editing was the final nail that killed this film.

4856486,2,B005P7XECY,"Alien Armageddon combined features of a couple of well-know television programs.  First in the line up is the alien in the stomach that can take over the control of your brain--courtesy of the Stargate series, then there is the case of an alien who decides she likes the emotions and feelings that come with the human body--hey, wasn't that done in Star Trek?  What stood out in this film was what the director chose to include in this film--the scenes of explosive diarrhea and vomiting.  We even get to watch the heroine using the toilet.  That's just peachy--if you're into that sort of thing!

And what exactly they were doing to the women in the ""birthing rooms""  and how exactly that worked with the eating and the mutating and the experimenting--that never was quite clear to me. The way the aliens integrated with humans seemed to be following along several different lines--it was rather like the plot wasn't quite worked out well enough before they started filming, or four different story lines were combined that would have been better if done separately.  We had the plot with the man who murdered his son (and then some), a plot with a young woman who was the daughter of a government official, the plot with the store owner and/or employee (the woman with an accent) who is trying to get back to find her daughter; and, finally, the plot with the scientist.  Each one of these people could have been followed from start to finish and it would have made for a much more satisfying film. Instead, we have an extremely hazy, confusing overall picture because the story was much too big for what the time constraints allowed.  However, that said, had the director left off some of the eating and the pooping and the coughing and the gagging and the eating of slop and the drinking and the washing and the insertion of slop buckets into the holding cells and the covering up of observation cameras and the long awkward pauses in some scenes as the actors stare at each other as if wondering how they should react or what they should say next--maybe not.",1323993600,,2063,4.645604395604396

If you are deciding whether to get this on Blu-Ray, don't. I have no idea why they would release it on Blu-Ray at all. The extra resolution is worth nothing when the special effects seem to be from someone in a high school video editing suite.
Seriously, the alien ships buzz by the traffic, blasting down their ray guns causing explosions that seem to be two dimensional and leave no damage to the pavement or even rustle nearby trees. The acting is what you'd see in a high school level production too. If this was made by a volunteer cast who did it out of love, then all the power to them.
I really wish it was better, as I'd really like to support the small guys making films, but it's just not there.

Everyone seems to live in cement walled hallways, both before they are abducted and during in it.  It makes sense for the cells the aliens keep humans in, but it's obvious they didn't see building another set for houses and other places people live in LA as important.  All they did was put some expensive looking long couches along the walls.  The aliens themselves resemble cheaper versions of Star Wars characters, always wearing helmets with face masks.  The story drags on and is weak.  Basically aliens have invaded, US forces nuked Chicago and other cities and all that's really left is LA. There's a few older human fighters who clash with aliens in the mountains but that's about it, other than that, we just follow a couple older people in the cells, who pretty much spend most of their time sitting leaning against the cement walls, and a couple of scientists who have crossed to the aliens side. I'm guessing the actors who were in this did so, due to being too old to be choosy and it was better to have a seldom break from their real part time jobs that they'd thought they'd only be in for a few months, quite a few decades ago. Maybe this film was financed through a government incentive to find work for older workers who haven't had full time work for decades or something, but if there was anyone under 40 in the entire film they weren't on there long enough to notice them.

You can work out what is going on pretty early and if you keep watching hoping it will get better, or provide some sort of satisfaction for watching, it never does.  Cheaply Made But Not a Fun Cheaply Made Film.",1418256000,,1753,4.4733542319749215

8482380,1,B005P7XECY,I did not care for this movie at all. I did not even finish watching it. This is one movie I will be getting rid of.,1392508800,,116,3.5
8482381,2,B005P7XECY,"this movie is worst then one of those made for sci-fi channel movies In fact it most likely is. I bought this movie because virginia hey is in it who's voice alone is worth watching the worst movie but her part might be 5 minites at most,what a letdown,the rest of the movie is bad lines and even worst special effects.

8482382,1,B005P7XECY,"There is only a handful of movies that leave me feeling dirty inside. ALIEN ARMAGEDDON is one of them. By dirty, I mean that I felt as if I had been rolling in the cinematic muck of not merely of brainless dolts but self-hating dolts. There was no one in the film that aroused even a modicum of good will, interest, or viewer sympathy. The problem lay not with the plot. There have been plenty of movies dealing with aliens attacking earth. THE WAR OF THE WORLDS with Gene Barry was a terrific ride that made me feel his pain, his fear, and ultimately his triumph. In ALIEN ARMAGEDDON, I felt none of these three human emotions that might have involved me in the plot. Instead, what I felt was a nihilistic urge to take a bath. When an alien invasion movie has the aliens as the most interesting characters (but not by much as they reminded me of plug-ugly low-tech Cylons from BATTLESTAR GALACTICA) then you know you have a real loser. The film never allowed any of the human beings to emerge as fully fleshed. The closest that any human came was the Cowboy and he seemed strangely peripheral to the plot. Other actors came and went. There were some truly ludicrous human women who began by hating one another and finished as near lesbians. I suggest that the director watch Gene Barry do his thing to see how a real pro gets it done.",1376870400,,1335,4.4089068825910935
8482383,5,B005P7XECY,"Sure, this movie has a restricted budget, but for the resources available they really pulled this off. Ask yourself how often you see a really original story idea in a movie...I can count them on one hand over the past few years. This movie isn't the spoofy/cheesy kind of sci-fi flick you see on the SyFy channel on a Saturday morning. It's something real sci-fi fans are sure to enjoy, and given a bigger budget this could have been a blockbuster. I don't see why awful movies like Skyline can create such hype, but smaller movies like this one are overlooked.",1369785600,,562,4.574257425742574
