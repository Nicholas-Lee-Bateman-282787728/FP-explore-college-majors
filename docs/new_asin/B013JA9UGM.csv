7367335,4,B013JA9UGM,"Bullying and suicide are at the forefront of this Slasher film. A bulliied teenager Lincoln played by (Ronen Rubinstein) gets sent to a reform school after defending himself in the form of a fork to a bully's face.

 While there Lincoln enncounters more bullies and accidentally summons the spirit of a (Moira) a girl who was also bullied until she comitted suicide. Now she's looking for retributiion. All of a sudden the bullies start being killed in bloody,gruesome ways.

There are some very violent  and gory scenes that involve razor blades. There is quite a bit of Splatter in the death scenes which makes for great viewing if you're a slasher fan.

Moira keeps killing even when Lincoln asks her to stop. But things get even more intense. We find out Moira's story and pieces start to fall into place.

This is by definition a ghost story but plays out like a Slasher because of the scenes of brutal violence. I was intrigued by the story and found it very entertaining. For the small indie budget they did a very nice job. (3 1/2 Stars)",1442534400,3,1045,4.621621621621622
7367336,4,B013JA9UGM,"I really liked this movie. The story was interesting, even if the main villains were easy to figure out. It was still neat to see it all play out. Special effects were decent, as it seemed to be mainly practical effects and not lame cgi. The acting was good and the characters seemed to interact well with each other. The ending was pretty effective to close the story.",1442361600,8,369,4.4411764705882355
7367347,5,B013JA9UGM,"Some Kind Of Hate is a vicious, vengeful and yet, sometimes heartfelt slasher about bullying and the effect it can have on those bullied.

Lincoln (Ronen Rubenstein) is an emotionally troubled young man who is bullied by his father (Andrew Bryniarski) and bullied at school for his quiet and withdrawn ways. When he finally strikes back viciously at one such bully, he is sent to the cult-like Minds Eye Academy for troubled youths. Nothing is different as the academy has its own bullies, such as Willie (Maestro Harrell), who, along with his thugs, starts to victimize Lincoln like back in high school. Lincoln has found some allies, though, one is the beautiful but, troubled, Kaitlin (Grace Phipps) and the other is the vengeful spirit, Moira (Sierra McCormick) who died as a result of her cruel treatment at the academy. Now Moira begins to exact gruesome revenge on those who hurt her, using Lincolns hate as a driving forcebut, does Lincolns hate run deep enough to want to see his tormentors slaughtered?

Directed by Adam Egypt Mortimer who co-wrote with Brian DeLeeuw, this is a nasty tale of revenge from beyond the grave that is also a hard look at bullying and the effects it has on the victims. The hate and anger of those bullied towards their tormentors and themselves, for not being able to fight back, is personified in the cruel and vengeful spirit of Moira, who uses Lincolns fury (like Freddy Krueger used fear) to fuel her gruesome acts of revengeand it is quite brutal. This is an angry movie at times and a nasty one, as not only are we treated to watching the mean Willie (Harrell) relentlessly provoke Lincoln but, the payback of the razor wearing and wielding Moira. Moira is not a wise-cracking gremlin like Freddy Krueger, but, a deeply hurt and angry spirit filled with rage and hatred, yet, still wanting the friendship of kindred souls like Lincoln and Kaitlin. It was a bit bold for Mortimer and DeLeeuw to give their boogeyman such complex emotions but, she is symbolic, after all, of the victims of bullying and the turmoil they suffer. Making her a main character is also risky and sometimes the rules of her appearance vary. At times she seems quite coporeal and can be touched and yet, she can appear out of nowhere. To harm her victims, she has to inflict the wound on herself and it transfers to them without physically being touched by her razor blades. It all works most of the time, though and effectively creates a vicious slasher with some important issues felt with under all the blood and gore. Despite tackling the bully issues head on, the film never felt preachy and is very satisfying as the horror flick its meant to be.

We have a good cast here. Ronen Rubenstein is solid as the soft spoken, introvert Lincoln. He conveys not only the youths sadness at being the target of the abuse of others but, the anger and rage both at them and at himself for not being able to fight backtill pushed. Grace Phipps is not only beautiful but, gives her Kaitlin a sexy mischievousness on the outside and also her own inner pain which draws her to the troubled Lincoln. Maestro Harrell is quite effective as the bully Willie and the role is quite the contrast to his lovable Malik on Suburgatory. It shows the actors versatility and his Willie is certainly far from lovable. Sierra McCormick is very effective as Moira. She can make her cruel and hateful one moment but, sad and sympathetic the next. Its never quite clear if she was the evil girl her victimizers make her out to be, or, if that is just a defense they created to hide their guilt. McCormick does certainly gives her a maliciousness that makes one wonder if she isn't as much a victim as Moira herself would have you believe. Also stars Lexi Atkins from Zombeavers, former child actor Spencer Breslin as Issac, who bonds with Lincoln and is his only friend at academy other than Kaitlin, and Andrew Leatherface Bryniarski as Lincolns abusive biker father.

I really liked this slasher. It was nasty and vicious but, with an important message at its corebut, one that is never obtrusive or preachy despite its weight. It has some very emotionally troubled characters as both protagonists and antagonists including its vengeful slasher spirit, Moira. The cast are all solid in their roles and there is a lot of gruesome carnage, though not enough to wash away the films anti-bullying theme. This horror is certainly offbeat and may not appeal to everyone but, it does provide the slasher goods and gives us a vengeful spirit who can hold her own amongst the more time-honored horror characters.

7367350,4,B013JA9UGM,"Lincoln (Ronen Rubinstein) is a bullied teen who likes death metal music (who doesn't?). When he is pushed too far, he lashes back and ends up at a desert camp, ""Mind's Eye Academy"" for troubled teens. Here he meets the pretty and manipulative Kaitlin (Grace Phipps) who forced me to look at her Daisy Dukes in slow motion. He also meets some more bullies, then discovers Moira (Sierra McCormick) a deadly vengeful spirit who we have to quickly decide if she is real or Lincoln's alter ego because the mystery doesn't last long.

The film had early potential. The development of character needed a few more scenes, perhaps some background glimpses on the other kids or Moira herself.

He is sent to a camp for troubled teens and guess what readers of this review? He gets bullied. All cliche and boring and to top it all off Derek is a stud athlete, in great shape and very handsome. This guy would not be getting picked on by anyone. Then his friendly ghost shows up at the camp and begins killing of his tormentors. The whole thing is pretty lousy. The director has got some talent. The pacing, editing were fine as well as the cinematography, indy soundtrack and score. Just another below average ho hum horror movie put out in 2015.

7367352,2,B013JA9UGM,"You know, when you read the premise to this movie, it seems to have all the makings of a good teen horror flick. Revenge for bullying, an angry ghost girl, lots of gore....but then you watch it, and realize it goes the route of so many poorly filmed movies, and soon, a promising plot and premise shrinks into moody teen angst and nothingness. The acting is okay, but the movie basically goes nowhere. My advice is to not be fooled by all the glowing reviews you see on the cover of the film. As I said, the idea was quite promising, but the action never builds, the tension never develops, and the movie as a result just drags on...and on...",1446595200,,642,4.358333333333333

7367355,2,B013JA9UGM,"It's very, very rare that I don't find some enjoyment in a movie - especially a horror movie - but this is one of those times. I'm only giving this 2 stars because Grace Phipps was surprisingly decent in his role despite her character making nonsensical choices. Actually, everything about this movie falls under ""nonsensical"" with terrible dialogue and bad acting.",1443052800,,365,5.0
7367356,3,B013JA9UGM,"A teen who is bullied at home and school finally loses control and stabs one of his tormentors with a fork.  He is sent to a reformatory camp where the bullying starts all over again, just with different faces, but then he inadvertently raises the vengeful ghost of a girl who previously died there because of bullying and who is more than happy to take out his tormentors.  Unfortunately, she doesn't understand why her new friend isn't happy about her bloody handiwork and why he wants her to stop.

The angry ghost named is named Moira (Sierra McCormack) and she is definitely something--an avenging angel who is sumiltaneously creepy, pathetic, needy and oddly sexy, and since she was a cutter her weapon of choice is self-mutilation.  She wears a necklace of double edged razor blades and wherever she slashes herself her intended victim receives a matching wound, but since she's already dead Moira's wounds might make her spray blood in messy splashes but they can't kill her.  Her victims on the other hand...

As cool a horror creation as the self-mutilating Moira is Some Kind of Hate never quite figures out what to do with her and the teen angst drama between the bloodspurting is painfully dull.  The movie seems more interested in fetishizing teen pain than in telling a coherent story or generating suspense, so you aren't given much reason to care whether any of the characters end up surviving or not.  That's even true of the film's protagonist Lincoln (Ronen Rubinstein), the bullied teen who accidentally gives life to Moira.  It would have been more interesting if there was an actual link between Lincoln's feelings of powerlessness and fantasy desire for revenge and Moira's real-life violent actions, but once she's summoned Moria pretty much does whatever she wants until Lincoln figures out how to stop her.  His charcter simply isn't interesting--he's all brooding and resentment with no signs of actual life inside.  Lincoln just wants to be left alone and the filmmakers should have done just that--there's simply nothing about the character that makes him dramatically interesting or would justify making him the hero of the movie.

The supporting cast is just monster meat that makes little to no impression with one exception.  Grace Phipps plays a fellow camp resident named Kaitlin who was a popular girl, cheerleader type until she bullied a classmate who eventually comitted suicide.  Kaitlin's remorse and self-loathing resulted in anti-social behavior and self-mutilation and warped her mind so much that she identifies more strongly with the murderous ghost than with any of her living peers.  Unfortunately, the filmmakers don't know what to do with Kaitlin, either, and just when Some Kind of Hate actually threatens to get interesting the filmmakers chicken out and have Kaitlin come to her senses and turn on Moira as well, which makes virtually no sense in the context of the movie, immediately makes Kaitlin a far less compelling character and leaves the filmmakers with nowhere to go but to the inevitable showdown of Lincoln and Kaitlin versus Moira, which is as badly written as pretty much everything else in the movie.  Lincoln figures out a way to take out Moira but no attempt is made to set it up in advance so that Lincoln's sacrifice would make any kind of dramatic sense.

It's very likely teens who can identify with the angst and pain of the dramatic scenes will enjoy this a whole lot more than adults who will likely find themselves impatient for the next death already.  Still, Moira is one of the more interesting and lively creations to come out of a horror movie over the last few years, and even if Some Kind of Hate is not a movie worthy of her she at least keeps things watchable and passably entertaining.",1442793600,9,3773,4.90566037735849
8728028,3,B013JA9UGM,"Interesting film set against a backdrop of secrets in a desert compound for troubled teens - their last chance before facing jail for their violent actions.  The blu-ray of Some Kind of Hate is not really up to usual blu-ray standards but this seems to be problems with the way the film was originally shot.  I understand that the night scenes are just that - shot at night.  But many of these scenes seem to be LITERALLY shot in the dark.  At times its nearly impossible to see whats going on.  Thats fine for the scare elements but gets annoying when it comes to plot points.  Likewise is the dialogue in the movie - it has to be some of the most poorly-recorded sound of any film Ive seen!  This fact is not helped by the fact that the lead actor delivers most of his lines in a word-class mumble.  I get hes the angry young man type but come on!  My hearing is excellent yet I had to really crank the volume on this disc (which is unfortunate when the film suddenly explodes with sound!)

The film is edited rather arbitrarily, with sudden cuts which give the movie an overall jerky feel.  There are some deleted scenes included as bonus content, but it seems like a whole lot more was cut from the final edit.  Its clear that the protagonist has a bad relationship with his father but we see little of it; and later on he explains it to Kaitlyn with a couple of throw-away lines.  But it seems too little, too much of an afterthought.  It seems as if the beginning was rushed and compressed to get him into the camp and into the main story as quick as possible.  The other characters suffer for this too; we get no real information on these people or their back stories, which makes us care very little about them.

As for the actors they do seem into their roles.  Ronen Rubinstein as Lincoln does a good job as a young man who was pushed beyond his limit into an explosive moment which landed him here.  Grace Phipps shines (as Kaitlyn), but as I said her character like the others seems only sketched in.  There are obviously many levels to her character but we don't get to explore them much in the fast-paced editing.  Sierra McCormick is delightfully twisted as the vengeful Moira (like Creepy Connie gone REALLY over the edge!)  The way she kills is also unique, and gives this film a bit of a boost.

The ending was interesting, setting up a possible sequel that, since this was made back in 2015, probably won't happen.

Overall, this is an decent film, although seemingly put together in a hurry with little money.  The effects are decent, the cast interesting to watch.  I didn't hate Some Kind of Hate, just don't expect anything epic or life changing from it.",1525046400,,2677,4.425357873210634
8728029,5,B013JA9UGM,"This movie seems to be made for a rather niche audience.  If your high school experience was enjoyable, this probably isn't the movie for you.  I watched it with a person who suffered similar mental health issues as some of the characters in the film.  While everyone's struggle is different, for them, the movie portrayed issues of self-harm as 'real' and 'ugly,' while most other films gloss over the subject or portray it incorrectly.

Some people like the acting in the movie.  Some don't.  Personally, the characters seemed pretty developed for a slasher film.
The desert reform camp was pretty fresh.  Not the usual cabin in the woods at night.  The soundtrack might not cater to everyone, but it pertains to the protagonist.  Supposedly, on one of the songs, the guitarist in charge of the soundtrack used a razor to play his guitar instead of a pick.  Lots of attention to small detail, and some beautiful desert shots.  Strong indie vibes.  Low budget, but they did a great job with what they had.",1520208000,,1006,4.7514450867052025

I was shockingly surprised by how much I loved this low budget gem. Ronen Rubinstein as Lincoln, is excellent tons of pathos. He plays this kettle waiting to boil very well. I'm not sure who plays Moira, she is terrific as is the almost girlfriend of Lincoln's.
