4174771,5,B003R0MF1W,It would be great if CBS video would allow downloads of individual episodes on iTunes or on their website. On the ABC TV network you can watch TV shows for free on their website.,1290729600,11,178,4.264705882352941
4174772,5,B003R0MF1W,"We had the cable for the TV disconnected about five years ago.  A friend told us about The Mentalist DVD's and we are very pleased with the shows.  Our family enjoys watching them more than once, and when purchasing the whole season, (or a couple/few seasons!) it's nice to watch over and over.  We definitely ""got our money's worth""...
Quality is very good- stories are fun, detective mystery, etc. Love the cast of this show...and we can't wait for the next season!",1289865600,32,467,4.670731707317073

4174800,2,B003R0MF1W,"Midway through season 3,  J J LaRoche is 100 pounds overweight but is seen in the field running around with the other younger in shape agents. Not very realistic!  I realize that it is hard for the writers to keep the plots fresh and interesting but can we at least see scenarios that are somewhat possible? These agents are required to be in tip top physical condition and he is just creepy to boot. I don't think I can keep watching. Too bad as this has been one of my favorite programs to watch until now, in spite of Robin Tunney's casting as co-star with Simon Baker. This could really have been done better.",1511222400,,613,4.368421052631579

It's been too long since I bought the DVD set so I'm out of luck, and I wouldn't re-buy it given the other media-related issues in various reviews. Too bad.",1483747200,,443,4.223529411764706

4174923,5,B003R0MF1W,"I liked this show because the main character  was a composite of Sherlock Holmes, Columbo, and Monk. He used power of deduction, (Sherlock Holmes) caught criminals through trickery, (Columbo), and was obnoxious, (Monk). I wish the series had run longer.",1474588800,,253,5.325

4174925,5,B003R0MF1W,"Some of the very best on TV. The Mentalist occupies the rare spot between drama and comedy. It's true drama, and it's often comedy without appearing to try. Great stuff.",1474156800,,169,4.666666666666667
4174926,3,B003R0MF1W,"Echoing other reviewers, this series is engaging, entertaining, well-paced (generally), sometimes whimsical and rarely overly serious  in many ways a throwback to shows from the 1960-70s.  The basic premise: Simon Baker portrays Patrick Jane; a mentalist, con man and faux-psychic whose wife and daughter were murdered by a serial killer in retaliation for a perceived slight. To pursue the killer and exact revenge, Jane works as a consultant to the fictional California Bureau of Investigation, using his powers of observation, analysis and psychological manipulation to solve homicides.  The CBI homicide team is comprised of a solid ensemble cast, led by Senior Agent Teresa Lisbon (Robin Tunney), who has the thankless  and generally impossible - task of keeping Janes scams and ploys barely within the limits of the law.

Ive watched portions of The Mentalist on network television and Im finally working through the entire series - in order - while indoor cycling. Season 3 introduces Special Agent J.J. LaRoche, head of Internal Affairs.  Brilliantly played by Pruitt Taylor Vince, LaRoche is a recurring character in seasons 3 and 4; and makes return appearances in Seasons 5 and 6.  What is it about the bosses in this show?  Virgil Minelli, Sam Bosco, Madeleine Hightower and J.J. LaRoche are such compelling characters, rendered by amazing actors.  Episode 3x18 (The Red Mile) is a personal favorite  surprisingly sentimental and insightful.  Overall, a really entertaining package  well worth the price.

While I really like this series, my 2-star deduction is intended to draw attention to the DVD.  My DVD arrived with a knife cut through the UPC code on the outer sleeve and through the DVD case (see the attached image).  The cut did not damage any of the discs, which work just fine.  I was informed that certain distributors deface the UPC code so the DVD cannot be returned to a brick-and-mortar outlet.  While this may not be the sellers fault, Im still not thrilled with the damaged case.",1473811200,,2010,5.116564417177914

The supporting cast all do an excellent job in playing their roles to perfection. Agent Cho is especially good. His deadpan delivery is priceless.

I waited a long time to finally see ""3""...I was deployed a lot and never watched The Mentalist while it aired on tv.

I'm really glad Amazon had this 3rd season-no one else did.",1438646400,,342,4.08955223880597

4175054,5,B003R0MF1W,A great story line with a great cast.  The twists and turns are fun to follow and they make it look like anybody could easily learn how to do detective work.  A memory palace is a wonderful idea and can be easily learned and is especially helpful for when you start getting older.

4175068,3,B003R0MF1W,"The writing, which was fairly good for the first two seasons, has deteriorated considerably.  In the end, the whole series founders on this one fact: No one who acts like Simon Baker's character would be tolerated in any law enforcement organization anywhere, and no one who routinely betrays and belittles his coworkers would last a month.  Few series can endure for more than a year or two at a high level, and here is one more example.",1430352000,,438,4.675324675324675

4175319,5,B003R0MF1W,"Seasons I - IV should come complete with a notice from the Surgeon General's Office: ""Warning. THE MENTALIST may be addictive to anyone unfamiliar with great television.""

 ""Well"" (I hear you thinking), ""maybe just ONE season."" Fool not yourself, Gentle Viewer. Simply bite the bullet and buy all four. Today. Right now. For one thing, they are a joy to watch sans commercials.
 I'm sure those who've managed to find their way here unaided know enough about the cast and particulars to go on with, and they have probably already figured out that the show is stunningly brilliant. Yes, it is Sherlock Holmes in modern garb with a twist, but it is so much more.

 THE MENTALIST, in fact, lays almost every icon and clich of the whole mystery/crime genre on its ear, and, in some cases, goes them one better. Just one ""for instance"" will suffice (half the fun is searching out the others): there are two variations (so far) on MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS. In addition, there are elements from many and diverse television dramas of the past, from THE FUGITIVE and PERRY MASON to STAR TREK. Yes, STAR TREK (Kimball Cho as Spock?).  Bruno Heller knows - as did Gene Roddenberry - that an audience needs a cast they can care about, which means a group of well developed characters who care about each other.

 I'm not sure Mr. Heller did all this on purpose, mind you, but the fact is that some of THE MENTALIST
episodes - to say nothing of the seasons themselves - have as many layers and contain as many traditions as the HARRY POTTER novels, including Jane Austen's penchant for misdirection, but it is certainly great fun thinking along those lines whether or not.

 And really, what more can we ask. The series IS great fun. Treat yourself and buy it. Watch it with friends who are unfamiliar and not yet addicted. You will NOT be sorry.",1360713600,2,1836,4.604294478527607

4175354,5,B003R0MF1W,"The third season of this excellent police procedural finds the CBI looking into everything from hostage taking, one of the abductions being Patrick Jane (Simon Baker,) a California gold rush, a matchmaking service, a decision science profiler, to making peace with an old nemesis. The cast is now such a cohesive force that you feel like you've known them all of your life. Everyone of the characters are played masterfully by the actor's portraying them. Robin Tunney (Special Agent Teresa Lisbon,) Owain Yeoman (Agent Wayne Rigsby,) Tim Kang (Agent Kimball Cho,) Amanda Righetti (Agent Grace Van Pelt) and, of course, the irrepressible Patrick Jane (Simon Baker.) Bruno Heller, the creator of the series, and his collaborate team give you the same standard of plot twist, camaraderie, suspense and keen insight that has made ""The Mentalist"" the great television series it is. I'm a big fan of Simon Baker but you don't have to be a fan to enjoy ""The Mentalist.""

This is an informative and educational tool in your attempt to read others. Jane has studied the clues and cues which are available to all of us if we knew about them.  If he is trying to get further info all he has to do is sound insulting or accusational, out of line and/or embarrassingly to  any potential suspect, then we watch as he watches their reactions, often having to run off as he is chased by an irate unsub. If needing to know more he prods them silly, until they see red, until he has a read, a piece to the puzzle, being able to set that piece in its appropriate place as he aids the law by being a great crime detective's adjunct professor. Especially nice is the way Baker's character eventually gets around to explaining to all the others why he concludes this or that about an unsub because of this or that reaction, smell, personality type having been found out, faults and strengths of each having been assessed, ruling in or out this or that, being able to prioritize the info as it comes in also going through his processor, it being an IQ-thing that finalizes the computations. From the Pilot into the show a few episodes all he appears to be is a jerk to the average viewer. We eventually learn there is a method to the madness he induces in others. Sounding, off the bat, before further explanations for his prickliness, it appears to be like the multiple misfirings of an intentional irritant, therefore as if being personal assaults, while in reality the reasoning behind why he does and says what he says is anything but personal.",1338940800,4,1852,4.541916167664671

4175450,5,B003R0MF1W,"I have watched The Mentalist from the beginning and have the DVDs for all three seasons. The character Simon Baker plays (Patrick Jane) is utterly without equal in its depth and breadth. A complete biography of Jane can be constructed from watching the character develop: how he grew up, and how that formed his personality and philosophy of life, why the murder of his wife and daughter affected him so deeply that he could not let go of the need for murderous revenge, how he loved being a husband and father, why he has a two-layered personna - the clever, funny, kind heartedly manipulative, crime solving, no-boundaries CBI consultant on the surface, and the anguished, despairing, heartbroken, insomniac, near-psychotic, celibate (9 years and counting) killer just below it. (And he does kill, deliberately and in cold blood, in the Season 3 finale.) What other TV character can anyone name who is so well drawn? Most of the episodes are extremely well written and insightful. Some seem to be there to stretch out the series because it is such a money-maker, but that can't be helped and doesn't detract from the overall excellence. It's a great morality tale, with some deep philosophy informing it. And all this without the testerone-driven macho behavior, car chases and explosions that make other series so tedious.",1317168000,2,1325,5.0
4175451,5,B003R0MF1W,"As with the previous two seasons Patrick Jane (Simon Baker)continues to help CBI (California Bureau of Investigation)as they take on unusual cases too big for local law enforcement. He also gets a little closer to his serial killer nemesis Red John as he discovers that there might be a traitor within CBI informing Red John allowing him to stay one step ahead of Jane and the CBI team (Robin Tunney, the marvelously dry Tim Kang, Owaine Yeoman, and the beautiful Amanda Righetti). The stand-alone episodes allows Jane and the CBI team to tackle a number of fascinating cases that are a puzzle to the local police. During the season Jane and his team come under the scrutiny of J.J. LaRoche (Pruitt Taylor Vince of ""Identity"" fame)and must prove their innocence in the murder of a suspect.

The show receives a very nice, sharp looking transfer. Colors and skin tones are accurate throughout and although blacks are occasionally crushed and there are some minor compression artifacts on the whole the regular DVD presentation looks particularly fine.

The 5.1 audio mix isn't quite as active as some--remember this is a dialogue driven show with moments of action but it is active enough.

The special features include a featurette with expert criminologists giving us an ""offender"" profile of Red John and suggesting what his motivation and plans are for the outcome of the game Red John plays with Jane throughout the series.

""Red Moon"": Directed by Simon Baker"" gives us a glimpse of the work that went into the production for this episode directed by the series star.

We also get ""Lost Evidence"" featuring cut scenes.

Still missing are any meaningful commentary tracks from the cast and crew (that would be a nice plus for this set) or even a trivia track on the Red John linked episodes providing us with back ground from season to season for each episode. The latter would be nice simply because the key episodes are spread over the three season run (to date)with more coming in season four. For those who have already seen season three it would have been nice for a commentary track on the final episode to discuss the outcome and it's resolution in the first episode of season four.

On the whole season three more than stands up to the first two seasons with further character development and a better understanding of Patrick Jane's character (and Lisbon's)which, surprisingly, creates an even large aura of mystery surrounding them.

Clever writing. Being something of a deep perceptionist myself I see the holes of the story and it is bothersome.  But again isn't all television a cult of personality?

4175455,5,B003R0MF1W,"Simon Baker returns for a superb third season as Patrick Jane, former psychic and current consultant to the California Bureau of Investigation (CBI).  Jane applies his keen powers of observation and psychological manipulation as part of the investigative team led by senior agent Theresa Lisbon (Robin Tunney), whose patience with Jane's often mischevious antics barely masks an growing personal interest.

""The Mentalist"" continues to present interesting cases for the team to solve, while highlighting their interpersonal dynamics and CBI politics.  Agent Lisbon will suffer through two new bosses, each with his or her own agenda and multi-episode narrative.  Lisbon will even be sidelined for one case, pushing the deadpan Cho (Tim Kang) into a not entirely welcome leadership role.  Grace Van Pelt (Amanda Rhigetti) takes up with a handsome and smooth talking FBI agent, much to the anguish of former boyfriend agent Rigsby (Owain Yeoman), but Van Pelt's new love may not be the man of her dreams.

Patrick Jane barely survives an encounter with infamous serial killer Red John at the beginning of the season, and the pursuit of Red John will be a recurring theme.  As the team begins to suspect an insider leak, Red John will strike back hard at the people around Jane.  Jane will also have to contend with competition in the consulting business, including an astrologer, a criminal profiler, and a medical examiner.

""The Mentalist: The Complete Third Season"" should be highly entertaining to fans of the series, and is highly recommended to that audience for its unique take on the police procedural.",1301702400,27,1608,5.177606177606178

I have the first two series now and am waiting for no. 3",1296604800,10,315,4.448275862068965

4175458,5,B003R0MF1W,"As said before, with umpty-ump crime shows pasted all over the television screens and new ones promised of the next season it is gratifying to see that one of those crime shows maintains its integrity and appreciates its audience the way THE MENTALIST does. The writing is consistently good, the crimes investigated require thought in figuring out the perpetrator, but what really makes the series work is the presence of the main character - the almost nonchalant mindreader Patrick Jane. Part of this is due to the inventiveness of the creator of the series, part of it is due to the script du jour, but the whole thing couldn't work as well without the subtle acting skills of Simon Baker. Baker knows who to keep the twinkle in his eye, even in the most potentially dangerous moments. He never pushes his skills to make the character look like a seer, but instead inserts his penetrating opinions in a way that makes the whole teams of investigators work well together. He is ably supported by Robin Tunney, Tim Kang (a far too underused actor), Amanda Righetti, Owain Yeoman, and of course boss men Terry Kinney and Gregory Itzin. It is a strong team playing out a clever idea for bringing justice. Each season gets stronger, especially this season with Simon Baker being given the opportunity to direct an episode - an done of the best ones!

I like the fact that the female characters are feminine yet very strong, with no screaming.  Never get tired of Cho's deadpan looks. This show stands up to binge watching really well!",1523404800,,300,4.730769230769231
