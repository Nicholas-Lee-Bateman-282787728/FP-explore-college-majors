3526477,5,B001D7T6A4,"A good clean film for the whole family. It deals with forgiveness and walking through tragedy without losing who you are. A reporter on the brink of losing her job finds a note that has washed up on shore from a plane wreckage. In finding the note she revives her writing career and finds a few miracles in the process.

It really could have been better in regards to keeping closer to the book. It is one of my favorites by Angela Hunt. The book has such a good story line that it would be ashame if everyone just watches this movie. READ THE BOOK!",1227312000,,549,4.228571428571429

Forgiveness is a key that can open doors to blocked lives...Especially the need to forgive ourselves...While very entertaining, I felt this was a truly spiritual film with a buried treasure.

3526479,3,B001D7T6A4,"""the Note"" is a wonderful idea that is well transformed to the small screen as a potentially moving inspiring Christmas story. What could have been a heavy handed weepie that clobbers you with it's uplifting message of renewal and dealing with tragedy is instead well executed by a gifted director & well written translation. Unfortunately, it nearly comes undone with a major miscasting of Genie Francis in the lead role. Not a moment of truth comes through her overwrought, dreadful performance. She brings everything that may work with Soap Opera acting to a telefilm without taking into regard the difference in the writing and performance technique needed. As a result she is woefully out of play with the other actors who have adopted a more naturalistic acting technique. By the end of it, I felt rather cheated out of a good film. It reminded me of why A CHRISTMAS WISH with Debbie Reynolds & Neil Patrick Harris works so well and this one didn't. In A Christmas Wish each actor was in tune to a sensitve script, light direction and dealing with sentiment without falling into sentimentality. Much of ""the Note"" follows the same technique except for the performance of Ms. Francis. It is an illustration of how one performance can damage a film & almost destroy it, even when every other element works well. I loved to give the film 5 stars and her 1 star. If she were only a supporting character, her damage would not be so severe. But as the lead, she is almost the iceberg that sinks the majestic ship. Luckily the ship manages to stay afloat, barely.",1224806400,6,1562,4.725274725274725

3526481,4,B001D7T6A4,"Have you ever wondered about what goes through the minds of people who had only a few minutes left in their life before a tragedy?

This question is explored through an uplifting and touching film which was the #1 rated Hallmark film in 2007.

The film stars ""General Hospital"" Daytime Emmy award winner Genie Francis who plays the part of Peyton MacGruder, a newspaper columnist, who is on the verge of losing her job due to low readership.

On that same day, a flight crashes in the ocean and while she sits alone on the rocks near the ocean, she finds burnt wreckage and floating along the wreckage and stuck between the rocks is a plastic bag with a note.

From that moment on, Peyton knows that she needs to write a story to keep her job, improve her readership and what best than to write an ongoing column about finding out who the writer was and find the person who the letter was written for.

But during the process of writing the column, the note seems to have a positive affect for the people affected by the death of a love one on that flight but also through the journey of writing these columns and meeting these people, it opens up old wounds for Peyton and for her to confront emotions she has harbored inside her broken heart.

Also starring in the film is actor Ted McGinley (""Hope & Faith"") who plays a fellow award winning sportswriter who helps Peyton by giving her advice, encouragement but most of all, his loving heart.

VIDEO:

The film is featured in 1:75:1 anamorphic widescreen.  A lot of the scenes are shot indoors but for a Holiday film, a good touch of winter and everything looks pretty good.

AUDIO:

Audio is presented in English 5.1 (Dolby Digital).  The majority of the film is dialogue-based.  Audio is clearly heard.  No major use of surround sound or audio direction to certain channels in this type of film but nor is it really needed.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

The DVD features two special features:

  * ""Notes from the Novelist: A Conversation with Angela Hunt""
  * ""Playing Peyton with Genie Francis""

I found the interview with Angela Hunt to be quite informative.  As a Christian woman, it was great to hear in her perspective of why the story was written and what she did to make sure her ideals and beliefs were featured in the storyline.  And the message the storyline brings.

The second featurette featuring actress Genie Francis talking about playing the part of Peyton MacGruder but the biggest part of all is Genie talking about one of the most controversial situations that involved her back in the 80's as one of the major stars (especially her storyline) during the ""Luke and Laura"" years of ""General Hospital"" and explaining how she left it all because of what a co-worker told her.  And while leaving the soap opera during her storyline's peak and by making an impulse decision to leave at the age of 19 because of anger, she hurt many people in the process.

She goes on to explain about the note and it's message of forgiveness.  And that for her playing the part, just having to go through the pain back then as an actress but then finding enlightenment through playing the part of Peyton MacGruder.

I'm sure it was not easy for her too talk about it and the fact that she fully discusses it openly was a surprise but how it ties into her role and her appreciation for the film and also working with Ted McGinley was worth watching.  A very cool special feature!

""The Note"" is such as uplifting and touching film.  I was very touched by the storyline and especially watching both Genie Francis and Ted McGinley in the film.

Before watching the film, the first thing that went in my head was Genie Francis...Laura of ""General Hospital"" and Ted McGinley from ""Happy Days"" and ""Married With Children"" and other comedic roles.

But growing up and watching Genie Francis, it's so great to see her acting again and playing an authoritative but yet an emotional role.  She did a great job with this role and I hope to see more of her in the future.  As for Ted McGinley, it was great to see him in a serious role and both had awesome chemistry together onscreen.

And again, going back to the film, sure one can expect a tearjerker from a Hallmark film.  But I was very much impressed by the message of the film and the overall touching storyline.

We hear so much about tragedy, especially with yearly news of those affected by 9/11.  Also, perhaps in our own personal lives, we may know of someone affected by tragedy or perhaps tragedy has hit closer to hom and even hit us hard.  There is a lot of questions that can run through someone's head and in this case, if one had a few minutes left of life, knowing that they may die, if you had a message to write, who would you write it to and what would you write?

In this film, the message is clear and simple but without spoiling it for you, I think anyone watching this film can truly appreciate the endearing message once revealed in the end.

The timing of this DVD is not only great for the holidays but for someone experiencing some sort of pain within their lives, the positive message in this film is quite touching.

All in all, a film that truly touches the soul!  Definitely worth watching!",1224460800,8,5207,4.516025641025641
3526482,5,B001D7T6A4,"I watched this movie on Hallmark the other night and had to buy it. It is such a wonderful story of faith and redemption.  Genie Francis (General Hospital) plays a reporter about to be fired if she cannot find her own heartfelt emotions to put into her inspirational column.  When a plane crashes into the water near her home, she discovers a note written by a father to his child and decides to embark on a journey with her readers to find the intended recipient.

The note touches every soul she shares it with, and ultimately changes her life as well. Having lost her faith based on events in her past, the note moves her to make changes that bring her a new love and a Christmas miracle.

The movie is based on Christy Award winning and bestselling author Angela Hunt's book The Note and is available for purchase on Amazon.

Hallmark Channel will air the sequel in January 31, 2009 - The Note 2 aka Taking a Chance on Love.",1224374400,6,928,4.4035087719298245

I caught it each time it came on and was delighted when it was shown again this past summer. Its message is timeless. It is well written with a twist of romance and a hint of humor. Genie Francis has been one of my favorite actresses and does an amazing job. She brings much emotion to the story and makes it so real. Ted McGinley became my favorite leading man.

3526551,5,B001D7T6A4,"I do NOT watch Hallmark movies, mainly because of the Bible-beating they always seem to do. When I was watching it, I thought it would make a great Hallmark film; come to find out it WAS a Hallmark film. This one focused on the human element, though, without having to say ""God"" every other word. I wish other reviewers on here had noticed the same thing, because they are certainly trying their best to make up for it. Don't be turned off by those fanatical wacko reviewers. Normal people will enjoy this movie. This was actually a heartwarming film about real, human emotions and how people might react to death, loss, and healing. This isn't really a movie about forgiveness. It looked like, in every case, the forgiving had already been done, but the connections had yet to be healed. The only one who had forgiving to do was the leading actress of forgiving herself...well, and the audience for having to suffer through her lack of acting skills. This isn't distracting enough to ruin the film, however. I wouldn't suggest buying this for a DVD collection, but it is not a regrettable purchase. It looked to be edited? As in some of the words didn't match? I don't know why. There was nothing in here that would go past a G rating. Well, unless you are one of those religious wackos who are hell-bent on giving your kids a case of Cinderella Syndrome - or worse. If that is the case, be forewarned that the topics include: suicide by drug overdose, the state taking your children, forced adoption blamed on her father, a husband being away from his family too much due to work...causing, GASP, divorce! Ahhhh, I know...golly gee whiz! There is touching and kissing out of wedlock. Television reporters are evil, but print reporters are okay? You could analyze this thing until the cows come home, but if you wish to enjoy it, I'd advise that you simply watch it as a fictional movie that tugs at your heart strings, assuming you have any.

When the news came to the newspaper that there was a tragic plane crash  from New York City.  While on the beach Peyton finds a note written by one of the passengers on board during their final moments.  Peyton travels to different places to ask the people if this is the handwriting of a loved one. The letter was meant for someone who was named T. Peyton a surprise herself.

3526655,5,B001D7T6A4,"I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). The Note Road was really quite clean. There was a few utterances of mild crude language (although if I remember correctly, it had more language when it aired on TV, than on the DVD); drinking alcohol and discussions regarding overdose, depression and adoption.  There is also an off screen plane crash and therefore people dealing with the loss of a loved one.  It is not rated and the Dove Foundation gave it a four star and approved it for 12+.

I really enjoyed the movie and will definitely watch it again.  I originally saw this movie on Hallmark Channel and then bought the DVD.  I like it because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"".  I love the messages about love and family, God and faith.  It makes for a inspiring story when Peyton finds a hastily-written note that survived a fiery plane crash and then makes it her mission to deliver it to its intended recipient by Christmas, bringing her readers along for the ride.  It starts out as a way to save her job, but turns into coming to terms with her past and forgiving herself, finding love again and something else that she thought she had lost forever.

Overall, I definitely love this movie, have already watched it several times and will be watching it again.",1369785600,,1345,4.502057613168724

If you gave me a thousand guesses as to how the movie turns out, I would still have failed to guess such a surprising, heartwarming, and touching ending!! This is my first Genie Francis movie and NOW, I look forward to seeing The Note 2, and The Note 3.  Ted McGinley was good also and played an excellent role, ESPECIALLY as a foundation, an anchor, and a sounding board for Peyton McGruder's ideas when she was unsure as to which direction to take in situations that were new to her and initially beyond her comfort zone: He the experienced newsperson, she the novice columnist.  Viewing the movie, we are taken on an exciting, meandering  journey----- just like the readers of Peyton McGruder's column, ""The Heart Healer"", hoping and wondering: ""Is this the person the note was intended for?"".  If there were a contest, with a million dollar prize, for anyone who could write a BETTER ENDING for Angela Hunt's story, the prize would go uncollected!",1360022400,3,1010,4.7542857142857144

I personally asked God for some miracles of my own from seeing this movie in 2008 at Christmas time on 12-7-10.  I asked him for six miracles for family and friends in hurting places that needed God's attention and work.  He gave me all six miracles by that Christmas 12-25-10 what a blessing to hear all the wonderful news in answer to my prayers.  I may even write a book about what God is doing in answer to those prayers even today.  Buy all means buy it for family and friends for Christmas or birthday or anytime.

3526680,5,B001D7T6A4,"The Note is a wonderful message of forgiveness and how people respond to being asked to forgive. The story unfolded as each person the note was presented to responded in a particular way based upon past life experiences. Initially I found the story interesting and entertaining, but as the story continued I began to see deeper meaning under that initial layer. I began to think about my past life and how the story related to me. There is the struggle in asking forgiveness of those you have wronged and there is the struggle to accept forgiveness when it is being asked. Both of these struggles are clearly seen in this story. For me the beauty of this story is the application to eternal truth of Gods forgiveness of our sin and our willingness to accept.

This particular DVD includes a short conversation with the Novelist Angela Hunt. That conversation was excellent and provides the inspirational background for the story and what she wanted to accomplish. That conversation adds the frosting to the story.

3526694,1,B001D7T6A4,"If what makes a good film in your estimation is topped by ""having a message,"" this is one of the greatest films ever made.  If this is truly what you look for in a film, stop reading; what follows will only serve to aggravate you.  Seriously, there are 46 (to date) other glowing reviews, read one of those and then watch this on Instant Video.

...

However, if what makes for a good film in your book is having (among other elements) a compelling premise, authentic drama, realistic dialog, acting that helps you lose yourself in the story and a fresh expression -- the next five minutes you spend considering this review may very well save you the almost hour-and-a-half of your life (a return of nearly 1640%!!!).

""The Note"" DOES have a compelling premise.  However, the dramatic tension is contrived, the dialog is formulaic, the acting (with the notable exception of Ted McGinley) is a recitation of lines with choreographed movement, and the film as a whole is one cliche after another.

I really wanted to like this movie -- and in exactly the same way that I like slurping the sap off the under-layer of a maple tree -- I did.

Compelling Premise: the idea behind the film is a wonderful sentiment: that in his dying moments a father spent this time crafting and encasing a note of acceptance and love to his child -- and that in the hero's journey to bringing this token to its rightful owner, the various characters touched by it are inspired to break free from their self-imposed guilt/resentment and recover the greatest aspects of their spirit.

Contrived Dramatic Tension: the antagonist, a one-dimensional ""bad man"" television reporter, acts as more of a strange distraction than a true opposite of our lead.  It is never quite clear how his ""meddling,"" which gives her story exposure, would somehow frustrate our protagonist's goal: to increase readership in her column.

Examples of Boilerplate Dialog: 1) ""I feel like I've been given this note for a reason.  It gives everyone it touches a second chance."" 2) (in a conversation whose context includes exactly one person, the main character's daughter) ""Have you heard from her -- your daughter?"" 3) (in the scene where the protagonist's boss is laying down the sink-or-swim ultimatum) ""Improve these numbers or you're out.""

*** warning: spoiler alert, next paragraph ***

Cliches: 1) The rookie reporter gets ""scooped"" by the unscrupulous vet. 2) The gullible intern gets snookered into inadvertently helping out the bad guy. 3) Two mid-aged women living alone -- with cats. 4) The tortured childhood of a now-successful singer/song-writer (who, for all her cathartic effort is still bitter about it). 5) In the sea of grey-clad mourners, the important person is wearing a neon-sign red cap. 6) The loudly telegraphed ""twist"" where the messager becomes the receiver of the message (I was waiting for Genie Francis to turn to the camera and say, ""you know, we all could use a little forgiving ourselves."").

Don't take my word for it, you can see clips of this film at Rotten Tomatoes -- Clip 8 is a quintessential example of the quality and structure of this film.",1322265600,5,3135,4.855534709193246

""The Note"", staring Genie Francis and Ted McGinley is one movie that is surely destined to become a classic!  The reason I purchased the DVD  was because I wanted it as part of my movie library.  The message contained within the story is something that I both appreciated, and would like to have at arm's reach on a day when I need uplifting; a life reminder about love, healing, forgiveness; or if it's a rainy day, and I just want a good movie to watch.

Set against the backdrop of a downed airplane, ""The Note"" opens in December with Peyton MacGruder [Francis], a local newspaper reporter, discovering that her column is about to be terminated if she doesn't find a way to get her readership numbers up.  Fate steps in and provides her with an unfortunate but needed opportunity to do just that: intrigue her readers with a human-interest story that will keep them tuning into her column while she uncovers the mystery behind a note she happens to discover, sealed in a plastic bag, washed up on the rocks along the North Carolina shoreline.

With the discovery of this potential ""last words to a loved one message"", comes a divine realization that someone reached their hand out beyond an impending grave to comfort the loved one who remains behind.  This profound possibility hooks Peyton's readers, thus beginning a powerful journey of inquiry into who wrote the note in those final life-moments, and to whom was his healing message intended?

The story unfolds as Peyton painstakingly investigates the surviving family members of those aboard the doomed flight, then chronicles her search for the note's rightful recipient within the lines of her column, ""The Heart Healer."" Through the stories examined, we learn valuable lessons about the human condition-those of errors, regret, and forgiveness.  In telling the story of those she's encountered, we learn of her own struggles and issues over regret and the need for both healing and forgiveness.

What I liked about the story is that Peyton MacGruder is someone who the audience can easily identify with. She's a likeably, good-hearted woman with a tender sensitivity.  From the moment she learns that her column is in jeopardy, the audience is rooting for her to succeed.

In ""The Note"", we are treated to a love story on many levels, with many layers: man to woman, parent to child, mother to daughter and storyteller to reader.  It's a message delivered in grace, with subtle yet riveting passion, integrity and layered nuances of varied complexity and dimension-what Francis does best!

I watched and purchased this movie because I adore Genie Francis! I will always be there to watch whatever viewing treat she has in store for her fans.  Ms. Francis has entertained us for more than 30 years, and her performance in whatever project she's working on never disappoints.  ""The Note"" is no exception.  Hallmark has found it's golden girl in Francis, and she had found a new niche with the inspiring character of Peyton MacGruder.

Who'd have ever thought that Genie Francis would, again, find a leading man whose chemistry is undeniably charming and playfully sexy?  Yet, that's just what she's found in Ted McGinley.  He is a treat as the affable, endearing colleague turned sage friend turned love interest-a sounding board with a heart.  Ted brings a precise vulnerability and sensitivity to the role of King that makes him an appealing leading man.  ""The Note"" highlights his own struggles with a wounded heart which yearns for the healing grace of forgiving redemption.

Francis and McGinley are a knock-out together.  The human-ness they bring to these characters make them an undeniable match.  The only complaint I had about ""The Note"" was that it was too short.  I want more and hope we are able to follow the characters further, because the complete story remains untold.  Hallmark has a winner!  They cared enough to deliver the best with both this story and cast.  I hope they send us more ""notes"".",1258070400,2,4247,4.870473537604457
3526717,4,B001D7T6A4,"This will be buried among all the glowing reviews, but I wanted to share my thoughts. The message of forgiveness in this movie comes through loud and clear. It is uplifting and inspiring in many ways.
But for me the chemistry between the lead characters lacked something. I know that is in direct contrast to what so many have said, but it was my honest reaction. I do not watch soap operas or today's sitcoms, so I have no history with either of the lead characters--I just based my feelings on what I saw in this movie and I had a hard time believing they would end up together.
Another comment, about the ""edited movie"" review. That is what actually convinced me to buy this. I had heard that when first aired on TV the movie was clean, but contained multiple uses of the Lord's name as an exclamation, so I had avoided it. After reading the complaint that it was edited I figured, ""What else would they edit?"" and I gave it a try. I was pleased to be able to watch the movie without profane language.",1255996800,70,1004,4.345744680851064

3526719,4,B001D7T6A4,I saw this on Hallmark and then ordered both of them (The Note and The Note II).  Very good.,1253059200,,92,3.8421052631578947
3526720,5,B001D7T6A4,"Great movie. Wonderful in fact. I love to see if I can figure out how the movie will progress in the beginning...I was wrong. Oh, I knew a note would be involved, and that's where my opinion ended. It was a very intriguing movie and it certainly made me anxious to see part II. The characters were wonderful. They kept you guessing as well. I didn't see the finale at the beginning..totally unexpected. Great. I'm happy I purchased this product. Look forward to seeing it again with a different set of friends next time.",1250121600,,520,4.542553191489362
3526721,5,B001D7T6A4,"This is a wonderfully touching movie.  Francis finds a note in a ziploc bag that washes up to shore following a horrific plane crash.  As a reporter she recognizes that this might be a great story - find the person for whom the note was intended.  What starts out for her as an effort to get a great story and get her boss off of her back, turns into a journey that brings her healing (from a mystery in her past), love and family.  Genie Francis and Ted McGinley are very good as the lead characters.  I didn't recognize McGinley at first as he is much older since I last saw him in anything, but the years have been good to him and he is much more handsome than he was in his youth.  He is also good in a serious role - I'd only seen him do comedy in the past.  I highly recommend this movie.  It's clean, uplifting, not at all preachy, lighthearted when it needs to be and heart wrenching when it needs to be.  I think this needs to be a part of my permanent collection.",1247961600,3,973,4.078947368421052
3526722,5,B001D7T6A4,"Based on a book by a writer of one of the major fictional accounts of the Lords second coming and the End of Days.  This is a great DVD movie and full of Christian values.
For a very good docudrama DVD Movie on Christian prophecy that is behind the writers ideas watch:

Both are well recommended.  Enjoy both!",1243900800,,565,5.714285714285714
3526723,5,B001D7T6A4,This movie has some good healing messages about forgiveness: both forgiving yourself and forgiving others.  I appreciated the depth of meaning that the movie portrayed.  Definitely a movie to make you think.,1243036800,,207,5.4375
3526724,5,B001D7T6A4,I was very pleased with THE NOTE.  I bought it to put in our church library so the standards I measured it by were more stringent than a person might have for viewing in his own home.  It met those standards.,1240617600,19,208,4.048780487804878

3526726,5,B001D7T6A4,Very touching movie - I loved the movie!  The end is amazing - a testimony that LOVE for your unborn child leads you to choose life for your unborn child - to chose adoption.  It is an act of love and selflessness - and it it beautiful!  Good will come from good deeds.,1236902400,,269,4.037735849056604

3526728,5,B001D7T6A4,"A column write Payton MacGruder (Genie Francis)is loosing readership for her column.  At the same time an airplane goes down and Payton happens upon a note in a Ziploc bag.  Her column takes off as she writes about her search for the person that the note had been written to.  All she knows is the note was written to someone called ""T"".

The real story from the movie and the column is the persons involved, surviving family that may be the person written to when the writer on the doomed airplane made his hasty written statement.  There are many lessons to be learned about life, love, and forgiveness through the people that were NOT the true person being written to.  Payton finds it makes not difference, and her readership grows, because of the stories she reports coming from her quest.

Of course, a romance develops inside the newspaper walls, or at least blossoms.  Another writer, played by Ted McGinley, decides to assist Payton, but has some of his own reasons to get close and personal.  And there is more than romance that he discovers in the columnist Payton.  She has her own history, baggage, struggles, that perhaps the note was a miracle for her.

A good twist of a couple or three different plots which end in enough surprise to grant this Christmas related movie 5 stars.  Don't let the Christmas time of the plane accident and the aftermath deter you from watching this movie in July or September or any month.  It's not really a Christmas movie, it just happened to take place in December.  Recommended viewing.

Taken from the book by Angela Hunt. Subtitles are available.  There is also a nice special feature with a conversation with the book's author. And more.",1236211200,3,1690,4.697278911564626

The Note aired on the Hallmark Channel with words that have been substituted in the DVD that I purchased from Amazon.  It is disconcerting to watch the actors say words that are not reflected in the audio of the DVD.  I wouldn't have purchased the DVD from Amazon if I had known they would not carry the original version.  I will be purchasing a DVD of this movie from the Hallmark Channel, but will ensure that it is the full original version before I buy it.",1228521600,24,540,4.37
