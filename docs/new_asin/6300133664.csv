They behave like bikers - well, they act how some movie directors might think bikers behave.  There are six yuppie girls who have an amateur singing group and, on their way to competition in Vegas, break down in the desert.  They stumble upon a small ghost town where the gang holes-up.  They are captured and threatened with rape - and worse.  But there are a couple hidden heroes who save the day.  Oh - and there are a couple of boob shots, just because it is expected.

Its not a bad movie, and its not a great movie.  But it is a biker movie, and if you love biker movies - its worth a viewing.",1282953600,,720,4.189781021897811
