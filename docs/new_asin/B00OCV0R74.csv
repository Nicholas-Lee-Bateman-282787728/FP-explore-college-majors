6735506,3,B00OCV0R74,"First off, I won't criticize the instruction from Jeremy in itself. He breaks things down very well to where the student can understand well and brings very simple and effective things to light. My problem with this set is that it says it's for beginner to advanced, and I would consider it to be beginner only.  Also, the set is only 2 hours give or take a few minutes, and I was expecting 4 hours or so (I spent a good 20 hours looking through reviews and YouTube videos from all the krav dvd sets on Amazon in my price range before I made my choice with ARCS but the other two I was thinking about were 4.6-6 hours in length). The first disc-about 45 min- goes over the mentality of krav maga, basic stances, and basic strikes. Jeremy describes how to throw these fairly well, though I wish he would add more variance (one that stands out in particular is that during the ""wedge"" counter to a hook punch, it would be very effective to throw an elbow to the face/jaw while stepping in, the assailant would still be halted and moved backward while being dazed well). The second disc goes over a review of the strikes with a few different ways to use them and some basic scenarios (basic strangle defense, headlock defense, mount defense). What I was disappointed in is that he only covers centerline and hook punch defense for strikes. As a boxer and kung fu student who had sparred with friends in many disciplines, I know how easy it is to work the angles (though Jeremy does a good job of explaining this, it's very rudimentary). What I wanted to learn more is blocking kicks and other stikes like elbows, which are not covered in this set. Also I was hoping to learn more about different situations where I'm already at a disadvantage (dealing with weapons or in a bad place like more than one assailant) as I'm fairly confident with my skills in a one-on-one confrontation where my grappling can shine if somehow I get taken to the ground. Again, What instruction that is included is good, but I was expecting much more. The third dvd goes over some very basic combinations like the jab cross (though I wouldn't use close fists if avoidable until I condition my knuckles more) and then you get to see the students practicing these combos. That, and a ""conclusion"" ten minute section close out the 35 minute last dvd. I was hoping to learn more of the ""mindset"", tricks, and variable situations included in his YouTube videos which is why I picked his set of dvds. I liked his online videos which showed how to use avoidance and awareness to your advantage before a situation could even occur. The main thing I picked up was the using your hand placement (hold them out and close to make the person want to throw a hook, and in a ""goal post"" fashion to get them to throw centerline) in order to create a more predictable situation. THAT is the kind of thing I was hoping more to see, along with weapon defense.
So all in all, while the instruction by Jeremy is good, I was hoping much more for my $50 and this set is mostly for beginners (I only consider myself a good intermediate martial arts student at best) only. I suppose I was following the rule that when starting with any new discipline you should start at the basics even if it is review.",1424476800,5,3253,4.458053691275167

Why are these so good?

Because one the quality is really good, but Jeremy knows exactly what he is talking about and instructs in such away that it is easy to understand.

I decided on ARCS because of Jeremy, and the fact that he trains and teaches Krav Maga to all US Military, police and other security units.",1412985600,24,505,4.408602150537634

He explains the techniques well and shows you exactly how to do them.  Multiple angles of the techniques makes learning them that much easier.  I am definitely a beginner when it comes to martial arts having only dabbled in karate (for about a year as a teenager).  This DVD set is the perfect way to get my feet wet.  I have also gotten lots of worthwhile information on their website [...].  I've only been using these DVD's for a couple of weeks, but I am hooked and plan to continue using them along with others from Jeremy.

6735518,1,B00OCV0R74,"Whatever this is, it is not krav maga. But will it help you in dangerous situations? As someone who has trained in krav maga and does instructing, I have to say that this is likely to leave you open to having your attacker overpower you or worse. Most of the set is lecture, with the demonstrations on the third disc carried out by students who are making critical mistakes.

Some examples of weaknesses:

 Dismisses many standard krav maga techniques and movements out of hand, saying It doesnt matter.
 Inconsistent: Dismisses blocks, but later uses blocks. Says he doesnt like the term self-defense, then later provides what he calls defensive techniques.
 Complete absence of retzev, which is continuous combat motion and a key component of krav maga.
 Complete absence of controlling the attacker after one or two strikes. The attacker will be free to come back at you.
 Says he is a big fan of hitting first; a little thought should lead the viewer to conclude that he can be charged in court with initiating an altercation. There is a lot more to this issue than this set presents.
 Keep it simple really amounts to oversimplification and the loss of a large number of crucially important techniques.
 Virtually nothing on footwork, which is essential for body placement for successful defense in such techniques as kicking, punching and knee strikes. In his kicks and knee strikes, he never turns his base leg, something that provides greater distance and power and relieves strain on the joints.
 Footwork in punches is casual and careless.
 The shape of his hand during his finger strikes leaves fingers open to spraining.
 Only 2 kicks are shownfront and side; what happened to the roundhouse kick? Rear kick?
 No distinction between kicking with the rear vs. front leg.
 Only the front and rear choke are dealt with; what about chokes from the side? In his defense against the rear choke, he fails to turn his head in order to get air.
 Virtually no help for someone who is thrown to the ground.

The techniques in this set are poorly thought out and can in no way be called krav maga. If you want useful and realistic krav maga instruction, you would do far better with David Kahns ""Defending the 12 Most Common Unarmed Attacks"" DVD set, which presents genuine krav maga that will actually keep you safe.",1450483200,4,2317,4.78391959798995

6735522,3,B00OCV0R74,"There was definitely valuable information in these DVD's , but after watching the set, I was left wanting more.  I felt a bit disappointed in that there was a bit too much discussion for my liking.  I am all for adequately describing and demonstrating crucial moves; however I felt some of the discussion was unnecessary.  There would be times when I felt like this was a discussion that I might have with a friend  - just chatting -not instructing.  I felt that he did a nice job of taking you step by step through some moves but overall I just felt that most of the information was pretty basic.",1438560000,2,597,4.440366972477064
6735525,1,B00OCV0R74,"I have many Krav Maga books and videos and bought this to add to the bunch.  I must say this set is the worst by far.  I bought these discs thinking that the material taught would be more like the Krav Maga of Israel.  Simultaneous attack and defense, Retzev, never tie up two hands with any defense or combative, etc.  I couldn't be more disappointed.  No blocking!?  No pivot on upper body strikes?!  His movement in fight stance to 2 and 8 o'clock opens his groin up horrifically!
While the instructor provides a list of credentials in various styles in which I am sure he is proficient, I am not sure the extent of his knowledge in Krav Maga.  In my opinion, it would be more appropriate for the disc set to be called ARCS Self Defense System with no mention of Krav Maga at all in the title.  I found it to be a bit misleading for what I understand Krav Maga to be.
There are many other resources I have found more useful with much more ""meat"" in them for the same price.

6735527,1,B00OCV0R74,"This DVD was a waste of my hard earned money and does not do KRAV MAGA its well deserved justice.

I love Krav Maga because of the  explosivity and effectiveness.

Nontheless...The presenter just rambles on talking with uninteresting information. I expected him to touch on the purpose of all the movements of each technique and how to make the best of each. Too much ""beating around the bush"" for my learning style.

When he finally goes to present the techniques he just makes it boring and doesnt add the realism that characterizes Krav Maga.

2. This is not Krav Maga.

6735530,1,B00OCV0R74,"Being Israeli, and having family members in combat units (as well as training in Krav Maga myself), exposed me to effective, authentic, and EFFICIENT Krav Maga. This Video is everything but that, and should absolutley not be taken as an example nor a representation of what true Krav Maga is like. Im not sure ""who"" exactly has trained with him that is ""from the IDF"" but i can assure you that is false information and that a nation such as Israel which is at midst of war constantly would not be able to survive if this was their method of fighting. Rudimentary techniques shown in the video are all incorrect and don't make sense even from an MMA standpoint or any other form of martial art (Rear straight kicks with no pivot?!?! Kicking with the toes of your feet??????? seriously think of that from a logical standpoint for a second...). Although in the beginning there are claims that not all Krav is the same (which is for the most part true), the Krav shown here IS COMPLETELY WRONG and should not be used by anyone in order to avoid your own self from getting injured. Bottom line, this video is a horrible representation and should not bear the name Krav Maga on it, neither should it be used by anyone to learn or be exposed to one of the most effective (if not the most effective) Martial art out there.",1431734400,10,1314,4.479166666666667
6735531,1,B00OCV0R74,"These DVDs do not represent krav maga, let alone good krav maga.  I have had extensive exposure to krav maga training.  I like to see different krav maga approaches which, if properly presented, have more in common than not.  These DVDs are disappointing both for content and price compared to what else is available. More than 80% of these DVDs is talking and gesticulating without showing any full speed, 100% technique executed demonstrations.

I like some of the points the instructor makes in his quirky style such as the inefficiency of micro-targeting, but, he does not really emphasize the principles of krav maga.  Again, while some of the theory is good, the technique concepts/execution is not.  There is no simultaneous defense and attack emphasis or distinguishing liveside vs. deadside movement.  I have both read and heard taught that krav maga founder Imi emphasized that a defender should never occupy two hands with one movement (when possible.)  The opposite is often demonstrated in these DVDs.  The instructor's movements seem to come from his other martial art backgrounds and at times seem a bit sloppy.  For example, he kicks with the side of his foot rather than with his heel for a sidekick.

Disc #1 is approximately 54 minutes, Disc #2 is 38 minutes and Disc #3 is 38 minutes totaling two hours.  (I am not sure why Discs #2 and #3 were not combined other than maybe just to make it a three-disc set.)  If you look at most krav maga DVDs they are priced around $15 per disc/instruction hour, not the $25 this set is priced per teaching hour.  Because of the instructor's claims, I bought the set because I thought it was krav maga - not ARCs self-defense represented as krav maga.  I have other krav maga DVD sets that are better for content and also for the price, especially, when you break down the hours of instruction actually presented versus the price of each disc.

What was shown in the video looked like some other form of martial arts. The 1st DVD was almost all talking and no technique at all. There was more talking than actual technique of anything. The technique that was shown would either get you hurt, or not even work at all. I was particularly stunned when in the video the instructor said that you didn't need to block at all. There was no mention at all of ""Real"" Krav Maga philosophy, i.e. simultaneous defense and attack. The other thing that was fascinating is that none of the techniques were shown in full speed with realism to show that that technique actually works. All movements seemed to be very lackadaisical with no sense of urgency. I would not recommend this DVD set to anyone as I don't think it is worth the money and the techniques look like they are poorly demonstrated and would probably get someone hurt.

It's plain simple and two the point when it comes to the subject of self-defense and self-protection plain, simple and easy to preform under high stress is everything you need. Arcs Krav Maga brings more of a actual Israeli military feel to the table.

Military krav is not layed out like that because Israeli soldiers don't have time to train like that they're getting attacked on a day to day basis.

Im glad I purchased them, the training is great and the step by step instruction is exactly what I was looking for. The way the techniques are laid are perfect for beginners and the training will help experts as well, perfecting what they already know.

After practicing these for a couple weeks Ive noticed I hit harder and faster than ever before. I cant recommend this DVD set enough. These are not techniques that you can use in tournament karate or in a MMA fight but these are perfect for self-defense or if you find yourself in a street fight.
Jeremys ability to break down the instruction makes this easy to use and learn. I contacted him asking if he had any other training DVDs and was told he has 2 more levels that will be on Amazon in the future, Im looking forward to the release of those. After speaking to him for about 30 minutes I understand why hes so good at teaching. I won't get into all his qualification but it was nice to hear he is a guy thats actually used what he teaches. Nothing better than real life experience to help you hone your skills.

This set of DVDs is great for beginners to intermediate students. I would say most advanced practitioners can get a lot out of these as well but most of us tend to have ego issues. This is not a workout DVD series but you should be able to take whats taught and get a very good workout if thats your goal.

This is not a cookie cutter self-defense training program, you learn techniques they will work for many situations.

What most people don't understand about martial arts, whether its  ju jitsu, Okinawa karate, judo or aikido, is that the forms (kata) teach you how to fight not just practice different moves.

The term Bunkai means ""to analysis"" or ""disassembly"", used in Japanese martial arts referring to process of analyzing kata and extracting fighting techniques from the.

What these DVDs are not, exercise DVD's, I had kind of hoped these would have been a little more fast paced, but after using them for a few months, I was grateful for the detailed instruction.

You will also not see any fast paced action. Every self defense technique thats taught is explained and then demonstrated showing exactly what to do, allowing us to pause the DVD and practice.

When I first got these I made my husband work out with me. We would watch one of the self defense moves then pause the DVD and practice the technique.

I did a little more research and found that ARCS has a website and the reviews I read there were a lot more positive than some of the ones on Amazon. The other thing I found out was just how experienced this guy is. I found this on his website, [...]

Take what you like and works for you and use it...throw what yo don't like and doesn't work for you away. The first 2 dvd's are more of a discussion and examples of 'moves' and techniques. The third dvd they show some examples of a class instruction. To learn and do this you need someone to practice with...try the techniques and moves to gain muscle memory so they become second nature. Definitely good info on here and I learned some things. Since I don't have a practice partner, I doubt I would pop this in the dvd player more than twice a year, as again, it's more instruction.
