5381192,5,B00A3A3UDG,"Skyler is a love story. No really, it is. Let me explain: the opening dialogue scene shows our lead Ross (Skyler) speaking with his therapist. He's explaining to her his take on relationships in both the physical and emotional form. Ross is portrayed skillfully by Dean J West, who is able to convey to an audience that he is both monogamous boyfriend Ross and sexual deviant Skyler convincingly without coming off as too Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde. Unlike many scripts, which would have each personality too strikingly different, Skyler and Ross have so many overlapping moments that he comes off as sincere and you believe that he truly does have an addiction and is not just your run of the mill douche bag.
 The script then leads us into flashbacks intermingled with Ross's confessions to the aforementioned therapist. We are shown two characters in one, and sometimes you feel as if you are watching two movies play out simultaneously. Ross is the perfect boyfriend to girlfriend Stephanie (played by Kristi Englemann). He attends scripture groups with her, they have yet to have sex, and they do the typical romantic/cuddling things together. We soon realize that Ross's alter ego Skyler is a little less squeaky clean. Skyler is notorious for hooking up and within the first 15 minutes of the film we see the pure attraction he has when he meets Amy (portrayed by the stunning Michelle West). Her inability to resist his slow, confident demeanor is a great foreshadowing device as to why he is the way he is. It comes easy to that side of him.
 Ross and Skyler have one common point in their lives: best friend Scott. Scott is portrayed by Tony Moras who does the job as the comic relief while still playing a major focal point in the movie. See Scott is important because he sees both sides of Ross and this shows how deep and truly connected their friendship is. Also, and I must stress this, it shows that Skyler is not so much an evil or bad side, just another side, of Ross. Scott and Ross's relationship shows that Ross is a caring guy and that he does value relationships. This makes the relationship between him and Stephanie believable. Ross isn't cheating because he isn't being physical with Stephanie, he's cheating because he has no mental strength over Skyler. And ultimately, Skyler's habits will lead to Ross's downfall in tragic fashion.
 Now, you may still be wondering how is this a love story? Without giving too much away here's how. Because the characters will fade, the credits will roll, and you will remove the disc from the DVD player. You will go on to the next activity in your life. You won't be thinking ""I just watched a movie about a cheater"", or ""I just watched a movie about a bunch of dumb kids having sex and doing drugs"". You WILL be thinking, ""I just watched a movie about forgiveness.""",1371600000,,2822,4.685483870967742

8546443,2,B00A3A3UDG,"I wanted to like this movie but it was too lightweight...too christian for its own good. Some people might approve of that and that's fine but in this case it takes the finesse out of real emotion or what could be good film emotion.
I will say the actors were good but the story was thin. No real connection or development. Kind of glossed over to present christian thought, really.
That being said i'm not one to judge, except, that if it worked for me or not. It didn't. But someone else may get something from it.
It was a religious based film.",1496793600,,547,4.320388349514563

8546450,1,B00A3A3UDG,"This was little more than a cheap attempt at a Christian morality play. The characters were awkward, the plot contrived to the point of absurdity, the flow completely confused by mediocre editing, all culminating in a sappy ending.

8546451,2,B00A3A3UDG,"While there is some good acting here, particularly from Dean West, the protagonist--I cannot whole-heartedly say the film as a entire product is a successful effort. Some of the actors seem unfit or miscast for their roles and the whole college student, ""down with the homeys"" vibe did not work well. It seemed real contrived. Moreover, the whole religious thing seemed very strange. I realize various Christian sects and their adherents carry-on in a variety of activities away from the sanctuary, but attending a Bible study and then headin' out to the club to drink, drug and party--hmmm....But even more bothersome to me than that was the editing of the film. It was confusing. For example,  I'm not sure at what point the therapy sessions took place on the timeline.  Were the sessions before or after his arrest for alleged rape?  Thanks for not giving us a Hollywood ending. But beyond that I felt the script could have been tighter, the college party environment could have been grittier and the whole Christian thing seemed a bit superfluous. While it certainly provides the protagonist with grist to grind anything in a skirt, since his Christian ""girlfriend"" wouldn't put-out, it was never suggested as a reason why they had never had sex. In fact, the ""girlfriend"" said she wasn't ready.",1436486400,,1299,4.9495412844036695
