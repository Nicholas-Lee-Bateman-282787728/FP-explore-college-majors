7794190,4,0970328710,"I own several bellydance tapes by 3 different instructors and have taken one class in person. Mara is my favorite bellydance instructor. She breaks down the moves in an easy to understand way. I also like how she stresses correct posture, which no one else has done for me. She doesn't try to cram too many moves into one session. This tape is fun; even more than the first. Also the look of the production has improved. I have her third tape on order and look forward to any future ones.",1037923200,8,488,4.373626373626373
7794191,4,0970328710,"This is a solid instrucational video -- Mara clearly demonstrates some basic steps, distinguishing how NOT to do certain movements as well, which can be very helpful for the beginner trying to learn how to do the basics properly.  She also puts steps together in basic combinations, which will help the beginner learn basic transitions. However, notice my use of the word ""beginner"" and ""basics"" -- this is by no means an intermediate tape. This tape is probably equivalent to the second class meeting if you took beginning dance from a live teacher.  It's relatively short (but, also relatively less expensive).  Overall, I think it would have been a great second half to her ""I"" video.",1020124800,3,687,4.905172413793103
7794192,4,0970328710,Mara is a joy.  Her command of the dance is evident on sections where she demonstrates a dance routine.  Her instructions are clear and easy to follow - I liked that the movements were divided into groups followed by a dance incorporating the moves.  Mara radiates when she dances - which is very motivating.  Thanks Mara.,1014249600,2,322,4.696428571428571
7794193,5,0970328710,"I just got this video to add to my growing collection, and must admit I am impressed. Mara breaks down the moves into easy to follow segments, and she is very specific in explaining how to do the moves bit by bit, which I liked. She adds a little routine after each segment, so you can practice what you were just taught. I have number of other videos on bellydance, and was initially worried that the moves would be exactly the same as I had in other tapes, but Mara offered me a few refreshing changes, maybe it's the Egyptian Cabaret style she dances in. The routines at the end were fun to dance along with, and it does give some ideas for dancing on your own to your own music. She also emphasizes posture and correct stance, and out of the perhaps 10 or so tapes I already own, she was really the first to stress those things directly. I'm happy with the purchase and will more than likely buy the first tape to pump up existing skills and possibly learn new ones.",1011312000,10,970,4.2771739130434785
