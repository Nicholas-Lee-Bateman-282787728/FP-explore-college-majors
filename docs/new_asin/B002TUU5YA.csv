Jackson Davis is wonderful - shows great range and comedic timing. Loved the chemistry of whole cast as well. With the number of awards this film has won, I'm truly surprised that it isn't a feature film. Would love to see this group of actors and director get together again.",1328832000,,405,4.2727272727272725
8380651,5,B002TUU5YA,"What happens when you combine clever writing, talented actors, and a gifted director? Answer: A great film and Latter-Day fake fits all of those listed above. This film is a very original and refreshing take on what it is to be a latter-day saint or mormon, and the common misconceptions of their lifestyle. You'll love seeing the hilarious moments that all audiences, whether LDS or not, can relate to. The characters are so easily likeable, because they feel real. So, it's easy to connect with the story and enjoy the humor.  I loved this film, and can't wait to see what else the creative team at everlight films will come out with next!  It's definitely worth taking a look at.",1257120000,,682,4.675
8380652,5,B002TUU5YA,"When I first heard this was an Indi film I was skeptical, but after seeing it for the first time it I was blown away.  The storyline was superb, the acting was great and overall this was a really well made film.  It was well worth my $15.  Even though It has an LDS based them my non-LDS friends enjoyed the film too.  And yes it did have inside LDS jokes but nothing distasteful.  Great film I can't wait for a full length feature version of this film.",1256860800,,453,4.1022727272727275
