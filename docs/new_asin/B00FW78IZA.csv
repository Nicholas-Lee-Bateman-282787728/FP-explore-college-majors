Don't waste your money on it!",1496275200,,94,4.588235294117647
8618881,5,B00FW78IZA,"As far as seller, this was great.  The content isn't what I hoped.",1415491200,,66,4.076923076923077
8618882,2,B00FW78IZA,"While what is provided in the video is interesting, and I enjoyed watching it, it lacks depth and is too short. I was surprised to have paid so much for so little content. Rent this one, or skip it. It is worth seeing, but it is insufficient for the cost. The video is about 30 minutes, and most of that time is spent watching really beautiful introductions to each 1 minute segment. I really feel like the people who put this together know something, but put forward what seems like a rough draft rather than a final product. If they ever do another video, I will want to see it, but be sure to look at the run time before purchase.",1390608000,4,633,4.239669421487603
8618883,2,B00FW78IZA,"I bought this as an accompaniment to the Yogastrology book, which has stellar reviews, thinking the DVD would provide a yoga sequence/flow that one could follow. Unless I'm missing something, this DVD is no more than a 20 minute commercial promoting the book with only  2 minutes spent on each sign. This is not worth the price and should just come for free with the book. I could have bought an actual yoga workout DVD  for $15!",1390435200,4,429,4.558441558441558
8618884,5,B00FW78IZA,"Short, sweet, and to the point -- which is showing the 12 zodiac signs and the 12 correlations with the body. Mission accomplished.",1386892800,,131,4.739130434782608
8618885,2,B00FW78IZA,"I found it hard to connect as it seem to be many professionals showing their skill and applying this skills through the solar seasons.
 l would of like ordinary people showing the importance of these moves and  a setting that would appropriate not enough learning for a beginner or an interested older person.",1386288000,3,309,4.811320754716981
