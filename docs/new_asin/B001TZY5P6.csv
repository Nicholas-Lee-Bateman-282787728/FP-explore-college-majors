8342574,3,B001TZY5P6,"Although the material on these DVDs is great it is meant for coaches to help them train their players. The DVDs are nicely broken down by major topics (forward skating, backward skating, conditioning, etc) but the actual content is in the form of drills. In nearly every case the instruction assumes that a coach will be teaching the actual techniques. In only one case that I saw did the DVDs show you how to actually build up the skills necessary to perform the drills.

If you are a coach then this is a great collection of skills to teach your players. Then again, if you're a coach you probably already know this.

If you're a beginning skater looking to get better you can honestly do better by searching for hockey tutorials on youtube.",1364083200,8,743,4.578947368421052
