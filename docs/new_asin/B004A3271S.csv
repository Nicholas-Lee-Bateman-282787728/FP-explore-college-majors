4295445,5,B004A3271S,"A great film directed by Elia Kazan, written by John Steinbeck and scored by Alex North. These are the ingredients of a great film. Brando plays the brooding Zapata in fine style. Joseph Wiseman a standout as a corrupt revolutionary and Alan Reed as Villa.
Anthony Quinn shows us all how to win an Oscar when your screen time is so little. Quinn, as Zapata,s, brother takes the viewer to another world of acting a role, his performance is a knockout.
Louis Gilbert has a soul for the times..and this is a good chance to see "" Margo"" in one of her later films. Quinn,s execution scene is one of the best two minutes put on film in a very long time. No video collection should be without this film.

This movie inspires and captivates, with its strong characterization of a proud Mexican people who changed the course of Mexican history by bringing down the dictatorship and corruption of the regime of Diaz.

4295455,5,B004A3271S,"I purchased this film mainly to hear Alex North's orchestrations with Mexican music, which he did so keenly in ""Outrage"" (1964 remake of ""Rashomon""). Mr. North, a real craftsman, always reminds us of the culture when he takes a motif from a traditional Mexican song and dramatizes it in the film score. I love this film, and Brando was perfect for the part. He has the correct 'macho' decorum, gestures and facial expressions. There had to be two versions of this film, Mexico and USA because Zapata in real life was not illiterate as was depicted in the USA version. ( For more info see:  IMDb, Wikipedia and Turner Classics ). There are minor discrepancies on this DVD on the Spanish dubbing. It seems they had to compromise the music in a few scenes but nothing really noticeable. Chapter 15 : All of a sudden the audio reverts to English for a few statements at the end of the scene. The photography and editing in its entirety is excellent, but the final scene is absolutely spectacular! The close up of Zapata's loving look as he pets his horse, the horse rears up, Zapata looks up, the overhead photography as the horse gallops away... it just doesn't get any better than that. I saw this film in 1953, a few decades later, and now enjoy it even more. ( I saw a photo of the real Zapata and he resembles the photo of my Mexican grandfather in Zacatecas, Mexico who also lost his land during that revolution ). -RP",1409356800,,1420,4.503875968992248

Also staring Anthony Quinn who became the first Mexican-American to win an academy award for best supporting actor for his performance. This movie in Black & white on blu-ray if fantastic!

He really sinks his acting chops into this role ,and proves why he is one of America's greatest actors of all time. Next to his performance in, On The Waterfront, this is his best role.

4295477,4,B004A3271S,"Fresh off his success in ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" Marlon Brando jumps into this very Americanized Mexican western.  He plays Emiliano Zapata complete with a wispy mustache and a persistent scowl on his face.  He and his rambunctious brother Eufernio (excellent Anthony Quinn) lead a rebellion over their land rights.

After Mexican president-for-life Diaz is eventually run out of the country, the illiterate Emiliano attains leadership.  The film, directed by Elia Kazan with a screenplay by John Steinbeck has its share of shootouts and action sequences but is most notable for some of the eloquent dialog provided by Steinbeck.  The cast is excellent as well.

Jean Peters is the girl Zapata finally marries and I was especially impressed with Quinn and Arnold Moss.  Moss plays a power driven recruiter who eventually breaks ranks with the revolutionaries.  The film hangs its hat on the moral compass and for the most part succeeds.",1360886400,2,940,5.178807947019868
4295478,5,B004A3271S,"Pancho Villa might be the more famous revolutionary but Zapata died first, probably because he was perceived as a bigger threat. Purists will probably object to so many gringos playing Mexicans (Brando as Zapata and Jean Peters as his woman) but that's how Hollywood did it in the 1950s. At least they used Anthony Quinn, whose credentials included being born in Mexico during the Mexican Revolution to a Mexican mother. Quinn won an Oscar for best supporting actor, which he deserved  because his performance was more convincing than Brando's.
Nevertheless, Brando has his moments, such as when he courts his intended in the presence of older lady chaperones who have to fan themselves furiously as they listen to his torrid words of love.",1360627200,,740,5.016260162601626

Brando, it goes without saying, portrays the struggling, emotionally-torn rebel leader brilliantly.  Anthony Quinn also gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Zapata's brother and fellow revolutionary.  Excellent screenplay treatment by author John Steinbeck.

4295486,2,B004A3271S,"This was the one film I'd always wanted to see but couldn't find of Kazan/Brando.  Now that I have, I find I hadn't missed much.  It's a miss, save your effort if you are a film buff.  Perhaps the best thing about it is that it planted the seeds for Brando to make One Eyed Jacks in Mexico a few years later.
Perhaps it's not fair to compare this to the two other Kazan/Brandos, Streetcar and On The Waterfront. Those are, after all, 2 of the best pieces of American Cinema ever made.  But it's difficult to watch Viva Zapata knowing the talent at hand and not seeing it flourish.  Brando gives it his all but Steinbeck's script feels flat, the production values are cheap, the supporting cast (except Anthony Quinn) is heavy handed, and the poor Mexicans are merely cutout figures.  Perhaps there is little room for improvisation here and it therefore seems stilted compared to the great films mentioned above.  My hunch is that since the script is essentially weak, Brando, in interpreting a famous figure while affecting a Spanish accent, felt less inclined to play with it, flesh it out, to get in his skin. Anthony Quinn seems to go him one better in this regard.
I notice that many of the other reviews herald the film as a classic and I might be missing something here.  My gauge here is in comparing Brando films, however, and in my estimation this one is somewhere buried in the middle.",1345766400,,1395,4.52988047808765

Intact, in English and the product of a film studio, not an Asian butcher shop. I give the DVD a big thumbs up and its detractors a big thumbs down. Get a life. As for the movie itself, it has always been one of my favorite Brando flicks (along with ""On the Waterfront""). The screenplay by John Steinbeck sizzles from start to finish. The performance by Anthony Quinn is not to be missed. I've always loved the musical score by Alex North, which captured the sweep and the excitement of the Mexican Revolution.

Director Elia Kazan uses all his masterful skills to bring Emiliano Zapata to life. Kazan carefully lights faces in the dark, shows faces in mirror images, juxtaposes religiosity and violence, and adapts John Steinbeck's profound script with a thoughtful contemplation in cinema.

Moreover, Marlon Brando realistically depicts Zapata's struggle to free his Mexican people. He adds an air of sincerity and caution in his deep gazes and wise words. Brando is excellent. You will be drawn to his magnetism and delivery.

Similarly, Alex North composed a glorious score for Viva Zapata! His music soars over the battlefield and stings you in the dramatic scenes. North is at his best here amazingly still brilliant right after his musical selections from A Streetcar Named Desire.
