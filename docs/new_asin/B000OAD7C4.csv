2792962,3,B000OAD7C4,"This young lady is an incredibly talented singer and musician and a great entertainer.  You will enjoy watching and listening to her explain her ""style"" and rather unique chord structures and Nancy herself will be the first to tell you, ""I am not sure what this chord might be called"", because she won't claim to be either a virtuoso nor a music theory professor.  For that reason I would have to say that this ""course"" is more for entertainment or inspirational purposes than for building a solid foundation in guitar.  She will ""wow"" you and you will thoroughly enjoy listening to her style, but if you actually learn from this DVD it will be merely to copy a few of her tricks of the trade.",1200268800,7,693,4.528
2792963,5,B000OAD7C4,"I have followed Heart ever since I was fifteen in 1977 though never got the chance to see them live due to only two of their concerts that I am aware of being in the UK and I was out of the UK for both of them.  I had always wanted to play some of the numbers and this DVD fills in the gaps.  Nancy has a no-nonsense open and straight way of communicating on this DVD and it contains some great solo material.  Having a mandolin myself, the Battle of Evermore was an unexpected and pleasant surprise.",1195862400,3,500,4.081632653061225
2792964,5,B000OAD7C4,"This is an outstanding instructional DVD.  If you ever wanted to play Heart songs on your acoustic guitar, get this DVD.  I count myself as incredibly fortunate to get a guitar lesson from Nancy Wilson right in my own living room any time I wish.  She teaches quite well, has a fun personality and is one of the best guitar players I've ever heard.  Go ahead and buy this with confidence.",1187827200,25,388,4.422535211267606
2792965,5,B000OAD7C4,"This video was great to learn from! Actually seeing Nancy play up close was super cool and I learned the songs in no time. Plus her calm teaching was a bonus! Nancy Wilson is the best acoustic guitar player in my opinion, so if you wanna learn from the great then I suggest you purchase this. Your money will be well spent!",1184198400,7,323,4.225806451612903
2792966,4,B000OAD7C4,"I actually do love it, but was disappointed that it starts off with Nancy performing (what was to me) the best version of ""These Dreams"" I have ever heard. Unfortunately, it is not included with the ""lessons"" or in the accompanying book. Then she says she is going to show you how to play ""Silver Wheels"", describing it as the intro to Crazy On You. She actually does show the basics of the acoustic intro to Crazy On You from their albums, but not the Silver Wheels identified as such on their albums (although played as a pre-intro to Crazy On You live.

But I do really like the DVD, and am glad I bought it. Nancy give you some insight into her thinking on guitar, delivers brief intros into several songs, performs a couple completely, and throws in some 12-string and mandolin to boot. The included mini-booklet is handy with chords and some tabs for the included songs; although not complete.

Overall, it is a good intro, I just wish she'd put out a second DVD to paint a more complete picture.
... and I would have loved if that version of These Dreams had been included as an MP3 to load into my iPhone.",1435536000,,1113,4.398058252427185
2792967,3,B000OAD7C4,Could have been better too folksy teaching style for my taste,1424736000,,61,4.636363636363637
2792968,3,B000OAD7C4,"It's a nice CD, though I didn't use it much.",1411603200,,44,3.5
2792969,5,B000OAD7C4,"This video might be a little vague for beginners but offers invaluable insight into Nancys style for intermediate to advanced players. It's true that she doesn't lay it all out step by step and note by note in full technical jargon, but that's part of what I like about it. I've been playing Heart songs on guitar for 20+ years and could get very close to the album versions of most yet the live versions were very different. She always changes it up live and in fact rarely plays it the same way twice. This video not only shows how she does it but what she's likely to do when she's improvising. You can't get any better than that. This video has improved my Heart covers greatly. The only way it could get any better would be to sit down and jam with Nancy in person.",1355616000,,770,4.280821917808219
2792970,5,B000OAD7C4,"Absolutely GREAT DVD if you love Nancy Wilson and her acoustic guitar style, like I do. The DVD opens to Nancy playing and singing 'These Dreams' in a very intimate setting, with several fads to various venues while she performs the song. The production quality and sound are just ok, and I don't even particularly care for the song; but it still brings a tear to my eye every time I hear it, just because of the way she pours so much emotion into playing the song. Every note is beautiful.

Then she stops to help you tune up to her guitar so you can play along with her; very sweet. Everything from her voice to her down home expressions are so delightful. You will get to know her a little bit better. The songs on the DVD are perfect for playing along with Nancy. However, don't expect to learn the songs just from the DVD and little song pamphlet along. I'd suggest using one of the many free on-line tab players that let you slow the songs down and play along with them first. Once up to speed, you can jam with Nancy and take advantage of her words of wisdom on each song. In conjunction with her instruction, I was able to learn slow down Silver Wheels to learn it, then in a few nights could play along with her (more or less). There are also countless You-Tube lessons on these songs if you need more help. It is just priceless to get her commentary and musical philosophy while learning the songs at the same time. No one will ever perform these songs like Nancy Wilson, but it sure is fun and instructional to try. She is the real world 'elfin princess', whose music and beauty are beyond this world.",1353456000,3,1612,4.337748344370861
2792971,5,B000OAD7C4,I think the best way to learn to play guitar is to watch it being done and then jam along. Nancy is patience and repeats harder parts.,1347840000,,134,4.0
2792972,5,B000OAD7C4,"I bought this video after reading all of the reviews good and bad, mostly because she is teaching some of my favorite Nancy songs, and I just had to have it. Some people have found it to be unhelpful but I don't see why. She shows you everything by hand, close up and finger by finger. And if you really can't catch that, it's all noted in super easy guitar tab in the little book that's provided. If this had been available when I was trying to teach myself to play guitar 30 years ago, I never would have quit. Because I would have been having far too much fun, (like I am now.)
Plus she includes a few alternate tunings to play around in, finger picking styles to play with and brief but inspiring looks into 12 string and mandolin. We get the Battle of Evermore for mandolin.
 She can't make you practice enough to be a good player, but she absolutely shows you how to play her songs featured on this dvd. All we need now is her follow up dvd:) Hint, hint, Nancy.",1331164800,10,967,4.198924731182796
2792973,5,B000OAD7C4,I love this dvd! It takes a bit of pausing and rewinding to really figure out what she does but I'm pretty much a beginner and this really helped me out.  I love Heart and Nancy Wilson so this really is a treat to kind of learn some of their songs. All in all a great buy!,1303516800,2,272,3.7719298245614037
2792974,5,B000OAD7C4,"I loved this DVD! I am a HUGE Heart fan and I liked the interview along with lessons on her guitar style. If you are looking for a basic ""how to play guitar"" DVD, this one is NOT for you. If you are curious as to how Nancy developed her style (hence the interview), and then lessons on how she played certain Heart songs, then this IS for you. I especially love the intro to ""Crazy on You"" and ""Mistral Wind."" Nancy has a very pleasant and playful personality on this DVD!I thought that the booklet that comes with the DVD was a BIG bonus!! So worth the $17.99!!!!",1278288000,5,564,4.18348623853211
2792975,3,B000OAD7C4,"I've purchased a few guitar dvd instructional videos from amazon and I was quite surprised to find one by Nancy Wilson. I recently ordered it, went through it, and found that (for the price) it is a good value.
Nancy is very mellow when teaching the material. She shares some very useful tips on tuning and it was very cool to see how the guitar parts for a couple of my favorite songs are put together. A new player will get a lot of info out of this dvd.
If you're a more experienced player, you'll find this a good value just for learning ""Dog and Butterfly"" and ""Crazy on you.""",1271980800,4,581,4.243243243243243
2792976,5,B000OAD7C4,"I am a begining guitar player. My adoration for Heart, and Nancy's guitar playing, led to the purchase of this DVD. I was NOT disappointed. Nancy Wilson leads you through some of Heart's most prevelant hit singles. She may not know the exact name of the chord she's playing, (many great artists don't), but she shows us in slow motion, and the included booklet provides the name and details of the chords as well. Just to have the intimate experience with this phenom is unbelievable. Through much practice, and rewinding the DVD, I feel sure I can play these songs by using her instruction.",1266019200,2,591,4.6923076923076925
2792977,5,B000OAD7C4,"I am a huge Nancy Wilson fan so just the fact that Nancy did the video required me to purchase it.  It was great having the focus on Nancy while she chats about her music and plays guitar.  It felt very ""Up close and personal"".  I loved every minute of it.  However; trying to follow her ""instruction"" made me realize I am incapable of re-creating anything Nancy does on her guitar.  She is just too far out of my league.  I thought I was a pretty decent acoustic guitar player until I watched this video.  Not even her verbal explanations and visual demonstrations enabled me to play these songs with any confidence.  Because of my faith that Ms. Wilson is perfect..... the fault must lie with me.",1258934400,7,698,4.440944881889764
2792978,5,B000OAD7C4,"I've been a fan of the Wilson sisters for 30 years. When I was a teenager Heart, and especially Nancy Wilson, showed me that it was ok for girls to rock. I've played their music in my live shows and just for fun at home since then, but I never did it correctly until now. Nancy does an excellent job of clearly explaining her methods on several popular Heart songs. I had a blast practicing along with her easy-to-understand instructions. This material is definitely not for beginners, but if you're an intermediate player or better you will love this DVD. Besides learning the proper way to play many of Heart's greatest hits, Nancy shares her great guitar philosophy and healthy approach towards musical expression and composition. It's already had a very positive influence on my own songwriting efforts. Keep an open mind and let this into your muse. Thanks Nancy!",1255564800,5,868,4.793333333333333
2792979,4,B000OAD7C4,"While its true this video does explain how to play the most popular of Nancy's acoustic licks and you get to see her play them, its mostly an interview style way to look at Nancy Wilson and have depraved thoughts. She does perform "" These Dreams ""
unaccompanied on the guitar and it sounds killer!",1250294400,,297,4.418181818181818
2792980,5,B000OAD7C4,"I bought this for my husband who is an accomplished guitarist and bass player.  He loves Heart and was trying to get some of the licks just right.  I stumbled across this on Amazon and bought it for him a little concerned that it would be too elementary for him which is often the case.  But, he loved it.  He was challenged and immediately set out to master her technique.  She is casual and easy to listen too.  He has not gotten bored with it and has just about gotten down the first one or two and is still progressing.  It probably isn't for the newest beginner, however if they like a challenge it is clear and concise and they would learn something from it.  I would think almost anyone who likes to place the guitar would benefit from this, unless of course you are Edgar Cruze!!",1248825600,2,787,4.3061224489795915
2792981,1,B000OAD7C4,"I was very disappointed with this DVD.  I was expecting to actually learn something.  Instead this video consists of Nancy talking conversationally while playing through the songs with little explanation.  I learned no more about how to play Heart songs than if I'd just watched her play on an MTV music video.  She never leads you through a song and actually teaches it.

The tab booklet is very sparse and provides short 4 or 8 measure bits and some chord diagrams from certain songs but not enough to actually play something worthwhile.  Essentially, the booklet is useless.

I was interested in learning the correct way to play the ""Crazy On You Intro"" (which I've played for years but wondered if I really was doing it her way) and ""Silver Wheels"" (which I`d still like to learn, but definitely not from this video).  When she does address ""Crazy on You"" and ""Silver Wheels"" both times she says ""People are always asking me about how this goes"" with a sideways glance as if to say ""Wouldn't you like to know too; but I'm not telling"".

The quality of the video is poor.  It is very washed-out looking and pretty much shades of brown (I'm surprised the Hal Leonard Company would publish a video with such a substandard picture quality).  The photo of Nancy on the video cover is indicative of the video quality; like a over-exposed Polaroid picture.

Nancy herself is pleasant and talented.  I really think this video could have been worthwhile if more time were spent on the booklet and the video, taking the time to explain what she is doing (which fret, which string) play sections through slowly so you are able to reproduce what she is playing (that's what a lesson/instruction is).

I believe very little preparation went into this video.  I appears as though the material is un-rehearsed and just coming off the top of her head.

I feel cheated and would really like my money back.  This video is for those who may enjoy watching Nancy talk, play through songs and sing, but you won't learn much.

2792982,5,B000OAD7C4,Excellent tutorial. Nancy covers a lot of material but makes it very straightforward. Highly recommend it for anyone learning acoustic guitar.,1224806400,,142,5.809523809523809
2792983,5,B000OAD7C4,"This video is a great one-on-one lesson with Nancy Wilson, a true rock & roll legend.  I've been listening to Heart for many years and had never even seen so much as an interview with Nancy.  So, a big part of my purchase was based on curiosity about her personality.  If this video is any indication, then she is one awesome lady.  She is personable and kind throughout, essentially guiding her ""student"" through each note of several of her most awesome acoustic compositions.  Through her descriptions of the creative processes and detailed approach to instruction, she makes the music seem real and possible.  I never imagined I could play something as amazing as ""Mistral Wind"" or the intro to ""Crazy on You,"" but Nancy made it possible.  Plus, she wraps up each song's lesson by putting it all together, and that's when I preferred to just sit back, watch her play and admire her tremendous talent.  She also demonstrates genuine humility by admitting to not knowing the names of a few of the chords (though they are all labeled correctly in the accompanying booklet), another example of her great personality.  I enjoyed every minute of this video and highly recommend it to any aspiring acoustic guitar player, especially if you like classic Heart (their very best music).  Thanks, Nancy.",1204588800,3,1295,4.872146118721461
2792984,5,B000OAD7C4,"I've never bothered learning other people's tunes I find it too boring spending the time but I'm a big Heart fan so I couldn't pass this up. This obviously features Heart's music but it includes Nancy talking/showing a variety of finger picking styles, different tunings, etc, all the background education that again I should take time to learn as part of any instrument playing. That's not to say the material here is for beginners but Nancy starts with the elementary breakdown and quickly moves forward so you need that remote control. It is a DVD that will need revisiting many times as a reminder by Nancy herself is that to play is to practise.
Nancy's accent and mannerisms of speech in front of the camera are very laid back. That's not to say there is any hippie slang but you do feel yourself reaching for that candle. When she forgets about the camera crew and becomes self absorbed in the music and teaching as if you were there is the best part. Off course you must too forget yourself and imagine that you're sat next to Nancy Wilson as she explains some aspect of the make up of a classic Heart song to you. What more can you want, a one on one guitar lesson with Nancy Wilson.
Well..except another. Come on Nancy do some more",1204070400,2,1241,4.495575221238938
