2435371,5,B000BPL2F6,"I found this movie by accident on my local PBS station last night. Unfortunately, I happened upon the movie when it was already half over. But I have to tell you that the half I saw really affected me.

The subtle and graceful acting, the African landscape, the beautiful language, the truly wonderful soundtrack, and the dignified, but sad story - a woman's struggle to care for her daughter and home (and later, her dying husband) and survive her own battle with AIDS long enough to see that her daughter starts school and finds a loving home - made this little gem well worth my time. It's easy to see why YESTERDAY was nominated for an Academy Award. I definitely want to watch it again.

What a lovely, haunting film YESTERDAY is. I give it 5 stars, and heartily recommend that you view the movie for yourself. I promise you will be affected by it, as I was.",1136419200,3,863,4.455696202531645
2435372,5,B000BPL2F6,"This is one of the most moving, beautiful films I have ever seen.  The acting is amazing-- all of the characters feel completely real to the viewer.

Although Yesterday's story is a tragedy, the film isn't oppressive or depressing to watch-- instead, it was mesmerizing and beautiful.  Even though her situation illuminates the AIDS crisis in Africa, the film is really about Yesterday's life as an individual.  She is a woman who faces many challenges (poverty, illiteracy, isolation, and life-threatening illness) but responds to her situation with creativity, determination, and grace.  It is hard to imagine a person who would fail to be moved by her story.

  The film also provides a fascinating glimpse into the everyday lives of people in a small village in rural South Africa. Finally, ""Yesterday"" is worth seeing as an example of the writing and filmmaking crafts, too-- unique use of language, carefully chosen visual images, and story pacing illuminate Yesterday's life.

A wonderful, truly special film which will move, enlighten, and impact those who see it.",1136419200,3,1072,5.186046511627907

It's gripping and compelling and it really makes you very angry at how bad it is in Africa with the AIDS epidemic. It seems to be getting worse and worse with no end results. I thought the acting was terrific and it definitely deserves an oscar. Not a nomination the actual oscar itself.

2435374,5,B000BPL2F6,"Set in South Africa, Yesterday is a beautiful and quiet little film about Yesterday, a wife, mother, friend and HIV infected woman.
Her response to the cards life has dealt her is the strength of Yesterday and the strength of the movie. She never allows herself to be a victim but is the overcomer. She choses to live and not merely resign herself to fate. I'm glad the movie was filmed in its native zulu and not in english. We see the intimate soul of the movie flow that way. English would have hampered that flow.

The landscape is harshly beautiful and unrelenting. the villagers are unforgiving and ignorant. Each character has an important part to play. Each name, each nuance each gesture each action isn't to be taken for granted. There's a lesson to be learned , each scene is as important as the next and when the credits roll, you know this movie wasn't made for the sake of movie making, it was a lesson in courage, forgiveness, love of the triumph of the human spirit, of friendship . It's a film about the choices we make daily.
And Leleti Khumalo who practically carries this movie through singlehandedly is powerful",1135900800,3,1132,4.603960396039604

The story is simple, the narration is slow and yet you are glued to the screen. The love of this mother for her daugher jumps to your face with very few words and a tough fight against day-to-day adversity, against the disease and against the hostile neighbors.

I left this movie as emotionnaly wrenched as I was after I read ""On the Beach"" by Nevil Shute.

Brace yourself and dive into this movie. You'll be changed for ever.",1133395200,7,549,4.169811320754717
2435377,5,B000BPL2F6,"YESTERDAY is a film that settles into your heart to remind us how treasureable life is.  Few films made with such utter simplicity of focus have addressed a world crisis issue in the form of one couple than this and for that reason alone this film should be widely seen.  But there are many other reasons to pay attention to this South African movie.

Yesterday (Leleti Khumalo) is an eloquently beautiful Zulu woman who discovers she has been infected with HIV from her coalminer husband (Kenneth Khambula).  She confronts him with that fact and his response is embarrassed rage and physical abuse.  Yesterday is concerned that her daughter live to attend school and have a chance at a better life.  She is befriended by the school teacher (Harriet Lenabe) and by the doctor in whom she confides (Camilla Walker). Growing ill from AIDS, Yesterday's husband returns home and seeks Yesterday's succor and forgiveness on his deathbed.  The power of Yesterday's spirit only grows stronger with every sad reality of her life: she is determined to stay alive until her daughter is safely in school and the future that transition promises.

Each of these actors provide astonishing performances, so delicately nuanced that they are able to pry open the heart.  The majestically beautiful scenery of South Africa, with its mist-clothed mountains and far reaching stretches of horizons, plays an important role in this story: nature remains the guardian of mortals.  Director and writer Darrell Roodt has a little masterpiece of a film here and one that deserves all of our attention.  Highly Recommended.

2435378,4,B000BPL2F6,"Set in South Africa, ""Yesterday"" chronicles the harshness of life in a small Zulu village, and the plight of a woman named Yesterday, whose husband works in the Johannesburg mines, and who in his occasional visits home, has infected her with the AIDS virus. When she tells him, his reaction is denial and to brutally beat her, but later comes home to die, and to be nursed by her. Yesterday vows to stay alive until her little daughter is of school age, and in the care of the village schoolteacher. The hardships suffered are unrelenting, making this film not an easy one to watch.

Leleti Khumalo is wonderful as Yesterday, and others in the cast include Kenneth Khambula as the husband, Harriet Lenabe as Yesterday's only friend, the teacher, and Camilla Walker as the caring doctor. The cinematography by Michael Brierling of the arid, desolate landscape has a strange beauty despite the hardness of the life of its people, and there is a mellow loveliness to the Mandale Kunene soundtrack. Written and directed by Darrell Roodt, ""Yesterday"" was nominated for a Best Foreign Film Oscar, and it is a story of courage and love, though an exceedingly sorrowful one.

So she builds a hut on the outskirts of town, and there she takes care of her husband until he dies. A village friend steps in to take care of her daughter after the mother dies. It was so very poignant and heartfelt. I was amazed at the woman's ability to forgive -- and to take care of her husband, after he had cheated on her and abandoned her. In the end, I do believe he realizes what an amazing woman he had married. It ends on a happy note, even though the overall tone of the movie made me weep for the reverberations of consequences according to the actions that affect those close to us, and how amazing it is that people are able to yet forgive.",1379808000,2,808,4.253246753246753

Her cheerfulness, good humor, optimism and endless doing for others is a lesson to anyone in how to conduct one's life, ill or otherwise.  I still cannot actually watch the scene where she gets the snot beat out of her by the individual responsible for her condition. Her love for her daughter, her huge desire that her daughter have the education she did not, her respect and regard for the new teacher in town who turned out to be the best friend she had in the village - all qualities that made her irresistible to me.  I must add that I admired the teacher's persona very much as well - warm, caring, compassionate (without pity) and generosity to Yesterday as well as to Beauty. I will fuurther add that I deplore for the most part the many extremely odd names that are given to children today but I fell in love with the name ""Beauty;"" to me, it simply whispered the quiet, endless love Yesterday had for her child.  If I had any problem at all with the film it is how someone in Yesterday's physical condition could have accomplished the building of the shed out in the middle of nowhere; where did she get the strengh and stamina I ask myself other than simply - she had to do it and did.

2435433,4,B000BPL2F6,"Yesterday embraces the demoralizing tragedy that is the ever increasing rise in the incidence of AIDS/HIV infections in South africa. It outlines the course of events following the infection of black women and the depressing, yet inevitable outcome for the children of these women. It projects the feelings of desperation that these women are forced to cope with in the face of dying before their children are old enough to care for themselves; Even more tragic is the fact that the degrading Pass Laws contributed toward the acceleration of the the spread of the disease in women and very often their unborn babies. The black men had no choice but to travel far distances to seek employment on the Johannesburg Mines in order to support their families, however meager the remuneration. Because they were seperated from their wives for long periods of time, they often resorted to sleeping with prostitutes who sold their bodies in an attempt to feed and clothe their own children and who were themselves infected with the deadly virus. The wives and children were not allowed to accompany them; They would have been arrested for being in the 'wrong place', as dictated by the Pass Laws. Women who were left in the villages had to cope with very difficult, often unacceptable living conditions, and had little or no access to medical attention, which caused the syndrome to evolve into a death sentence. The beginning of the end for Yesterday, played by the very graceful Leleti Khumalo, is marked by her second attempt at seeing the compassionate village doctor, Camilla Walker. Yesterday had already begun to manifest signs of the complications of AIDS, and was showing suttle signs of growing weaker.  yet, her determination to care for her little girl became her driving force to walk the many miles to see the village doctor.  The diagnosis is confirmed after a blood test, and the doctor advises Yesterday to alert her husband, who is away from home and working on a mine in Johannesburg. His reaction is one of rage, disbelief and again rage. He lashes out at Yesterday as she is the bearer of the life-altering news. Ofcourse, he fails to apologize or even acknowledge the fact that his poor judgement had created a cloud of doom for himself as well as for Yesterday and their child. Yesterday returns to the village and to a very uncertain future. As the disease progresses, her husband begins to suffer from the more undignified side effects that the other miners find offensive, such as chronic diarrhea-there are no toilets underground. He loses his job and is forced to return to the village, where ignorance leads the other villagers to treat him as though he were an epidemic. Yesterday builds a make-shift hospital with her bare hands, which she uses to shelter her husband from the soul-destroying village gossip. Placing her own medical needs on hold, she cares for her sick husband and daughter. Her husband dies, allowing Yesterday the opportunity to recognize the graveness of her own deteriorating health. Leaving her child behind without seeing her on the road to obtaining a decent education disturbs her more than dying. Her only friend, the school teacher, Harriet Lenabe, promises to care for Yesterday's little girl as if she were her own, after Yesterday's passing. Yesterday's love of her child sustains her until the little girl's first day at school. She stands at the gate of the school. It is a bitter sweet moment in her life as she beams with pride, watching the little girl, and cries inwardly, knowing what bitter fate awaits both of them. However, she becomes more accepting of the disease that will slowly consume her until she too will die, as her husband did. The ending leaves one with an array of emotions - sadness, anger, emptiness and anguish, knowing that in South Africa this scene is replayed ad nauseam. An infinite number of mothers are being infected every day. Many are unaware that they have already been infected. After a complicated and soul destroying cycle of events (as they are poor, many end up being treated as outcasts, have no access to medical care, have no transport to obtain medical care and are not able to care for their children), they die without dignity, leaving behind children who are not old enough to take care of themselves. With no one to take care of them, many children end up as orphans or street children which has become yet another serious outcome of the Epidemic. An estimated five and a half million people were infected with AIDS and HIV in 2009, leaving behind close to three million AIDS orphans! I highly recommend this movie. It is sad, but graceful.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Through-the-Eyes-of-a-South-African-Woman-and-Other-Children/dp/1609112199/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Through the Eyes of a South African Woman and Other Children</a>",1287964800,,4885,5.067080745341615

2435437,4,B000BPL2F6,I really can't say enough about this film. It's presented as a rather light topical piece about a family in Africa who learns they have contracted the AIDs virus. It avoids seeping political statements (namely accusations) and still engages in a fairly interesting discussion about the stigma associated with the disease.

2435459,5,B000BPL2F6,"Yesterday is a heartrending portrait of a very brave South African woman who, after falling ill, learns that she is HIV positive--and that her prognosis is poor to say the least. While this is not a film for the faint at heart, it's a rare look at how AIDS affects people in rural African communities. The acting is very convincing; the casting could not have been done any better. The cinematography is especially memorable as this film was shot in Africa; the scenic landscapes and that long opening shot of the African desert stand out and even drive home the desolation the principle characters feel during the movie. The choreography works best in crowd scenes but the scenes at the village water well are also very well choreographed. The plot held my attention every step of the way and at the end I was very deeply moved.

When the film begins we quickly meet a young South African woman named Yesterday (Leleti Khumalo) and her daughter Beauty (Lihle Mvelase) as they make the long walk to a medical clinic far from their village. Unfortunately, when they arrive they are turned away--they have come too late for the clinic's only doctor to be able to see them; and this happens again the following week. However, Yesterday has a bit of good luck; she befriends a newcomer to the village who is a warmhearted schoolteacher (Harriet Lenabe). The teacher sees that Yesterday has difficulty just getting to the other village in time to make the doctor so she pays the five rand for Yesterday to take a taxi to the clinic. Once at the clinic, Yesterday becomes alarmed when the doctor (Camilla Walker) wants to draw blood for testing. Things only worsen; when Yesterday returns the following week for her blood test results she learns that she is HIV positive and that she will surely die because there just isn't enough medicine for the clinic to save lives.

And it gets even bleaker, although Yesterday bravely puts on a smile for the sake of keeping her daughter Beauty in good spirits. Yesterday must now tell her husband John (Kenneth Khambula), who works in a mine in Johannesburg, that she is HIV positive and that he must get tested for the virus, too. When Yesterday tells John, he becomes enraged at the very thought of all this and he viciously beats up Yesterday while the supervisor simply sits there and does nothing to stop it.

Of course, from here the plot can go anywhere. How long with Yesterday live? She wants to survive at least until her child Beauty starts school. Will her husband John also be HIV positive? Will Beauty need to get tested as well? What happens if the villagers ostracize the family? Who will look after Beauty when Yesterday has passed on? Watch and find out.

Yesterday is one of those rare movies that you watch knowing that you're seeing a very high quality film from start to finish. These actors gave everything they had to make their performances shine; and it shows. This is a remarkably poignant drama that should stir emotions in anyone who has a heart. In addition, I highly recommend this film for people interested in human rights and the fight against AIDS.",1238371200,2,3118,4.694698354661791

This first Zulu film with an international release (and original music) puts a human face on this nightmare. It also shines a light on the complex web of forces that conspire against Africans with HIV/AIDS, especially women. There is only one man in this film, John, and he's absent. John works in a mine in Johannesburg, passed the AIDS virus to his wife, Yesterday, and beats her when she tells him the bad news about her ""falling down sickness."" Yesterday was so named by her father who said that ""things were better yesterday than today."" And so they were. Yesterday struggles to raise her daughter, Beauty, but the forces against her are many: economic exploitation, superstitions in her remote village, cultural myths, gender discrimination, environmental degradation, a paucity of medical care that's a two-hour walk, etc. But like so many brave women, Yesterday vows, ""Until my child goes to school, I'll not die of this disease.""

2435466,4,B000BPL2F6,"I bought ""Yesterday"" with no misgivings.  I understood that it was an Oscar-nominated film in the category of Best Foreign Language movie.  For me, that category holds lots of promise for a movie; one that is cinematically sound but little known in the US due to the language barrier.  ""Yesterday"" lived up to those anticipations.  It is a story of a woman who finds that she is infected with AIDS.  It gives a look at the social stigma as it was felt by her in her native South Africa.  It also gives a look at a person whose determination helps her to remain focussed while much around her crumbles.  In that sense it is a moving tale of courage mixed with a look at life in a rural South African village and the challenges that adds to Yesterday's dilemna.

The leading actress, Leleti Khumalo, has an infectuous smile that endears us to her from the start.  The entire cast was new to me and I confess that I was aprehensive when I saw that the movie was produced by HBO Films.  I was afraid to find a ""made for (cable) TV"" look about it.  I'm glad to say that my fears were relieved (However, I fully expected the film to close with an on-screen lecture about the ravaging effects of the spread of AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa...it didn't).  If the movie has any shortcomings then, for me, they lie in its' failure to more fully develop the community that Yesterday lives in.

First of all, it's true you have to read the English text on the bottom of the screen for the entire length of the movie, and honestly, I think this may be the first time I've actually done that (usually when the characters in a film aren't speaking in English, I turn it over).  I simply COULD NOT turn away from the amazing twists and turns of this storyline, and watching the problems this poor woman had to go through.  I liked how she kept repeating ""I'm not angry about anything"" throughout the film, while other people in the village were basically questioning ""How can that be possible"".

She was certainly a courageous woman- she had to work hard for her daughter and her husband who was working far away from where they live because the family was so poor, along with the entire village.  There was some very interesting moments when the woman went to find her husband, and talk to him about the HIV virus.  Some rather shocking things, to be honest.

What the woman does at the end of the film for her husband is amazing, and I won't spoil it for anyone.  It's amazing that she'd be willing to do that after what has happened, but her belief in supporting her husband and daughter was very powerful and important to her on a personal level.  And the whole time she remained grateful for so many things, even during all the bad times, and the times where she couldn't afford things, and during all the times she had to wait for the doctor only for the doctor to be busy and not want to see her until the next week.

A must watch.",1184112000,2,1815,4.305882352941176

2435480,5,B000BPL2F6,"This movie so strongly corresponds to much of the information given in books like ""African Feminism"" and ""Black Death: AIDS in Africa"" to name a few. The depiction of Yesterday's grief and acceptance, in addition to her husband's denial, rings true and brings tears to your eyes. One interesting point is the fact that HIV is not even mentioned until half way through the movie, even then it is called 'the virus.' This could mimic the attitude of silence by Africans on the issue. Other fine points about this film include the fact that is truly one story. Yesterday is not then compared to thousands of other dying women, although we know that this is the case. We see the world through her eyes and in her small village. This is a movie about the power of the human heart. Great movie. I would definitely recommend this movie.",1160524800,,829,4.608108108108108

2435482,5,B000BPL2F6,"""Where does the river go?"" the small daughter asks her mother as they wash clothes on the special washing stones at the river.
""To the sea. It comes from the mountains,"" she replies, ""and it cannot run backwards."" Thus runs a paraphrased passage of dialogue from ""Yesterday.""

This powerful film of compassion and communtity is directed by Darrell James Roodt, best known for his film ""Cry the Beloved Country,"" a stunning film based on the literary classic of South African life by the same name. His film ""Yesterday"" was nominated for many awards in 2004, the year of its release: best foregn language film for the Academy Awards; the Official Selection of such prestigious film festivals as the Toronto International film festival,and London Film Festival. In 2005, ""Yesterday"" was the Independent Spirit Awards Best Foreign Film nominee. But it was the Human Rights Film Award at the Venice Film Festival in 2004 where it scooped up the prize.

But, back to that river. ""Yesterday"" shows the river of love, harsh and true. All types of love: mother-daughter; communal; professional; the reinstatement and deepening of a marriage at the end of life, and a vast landscape holding its humans. ""Yesterday"" shows the river of time. No, it cannot run backwards. Only to the sea.

2435485,2,B000BPL2F6,"Full disclosure: I am a white American who has lived in a village in the rural Eastern Cape for about two years, and a competent Xhosa and Zulu speaker.

Given the state of black filmmaking and theatre in South Africa, why release another movie written and directed by whites?  No offense to DJ Roodt but there are a lot of moments in this film that just don't make sense.  1st the accents are weird--these people are all supposed to live in the same village and some speak with a strong Zulu accent and others like Xhosa-speakers from the Transkei.  This just shows the film for what it is--a project aimed at international English-speakers, not black South Africans.  2nd, Yesterday has presumably been married in this village 5-6 years since she has a kid...why does she take her kid on a 3 hour walk with her to the clinic?  It's completely incredible that she wouldn't have kin and friends who would watch the child.  Then when someone does watch the child it's a teacher from outside who's been there 2-3 months??  3rd, where are her husband's male relatives checking up on here? 4th, if her husband is working and she's living in pretty posh digs (compared to most rural African households, esp. in an area as far from the road as she is supposed to be) why won't she spend R5 for the taxi fare to get to the clinic on time?  5th, there's no way that taxi would have taken her alone for R5--either she'd be waiting for it to fill up or she'd need to pay a couple 100 Rand to hire it exclusively.

It's not just that these points are incongruous; I wonder why the actors, some of whom must come from rural backgrounds, didn't alert the writer/director to the unrealistic moments in the script.",1141344000,19,1699,4.504885993485342
2435486,5,B000BPL2F6,"Get ready to cry, but also, to be inspired. Besides the pain of being given the news your illness is terminal, the movie's character also shows the great strength in a culture that has to struggle so hard to survive. Yesterday is a wonderful woman who has a soft heart, but who is also resilient enough to make up her mind that she will endure. She fights to make the best of her situation for her daughter's sake. The writers and director also did a wonderful job of highlighting the amount of work that still must be done to educate people about Aids. This is a movie that must be watched!

2435487,5,B000BPL2F6,"""Yesterday"" opens with a long slow camera pan over South African Desert.  When it seemed too long I looked at the timer on the DVD player and 3 1/2 minutes had passed - just a camera passing across the desert.  Then the camera picks up two lone figures walking up the road, a young black mother and her child.  They pass two women who ask them how far it is to their village.  ""We've been walking over two hours"", the young woman says.  She clearly has far to walk still.

The woman finally arrives at her destination - to get in line to see a Doctor who comes to the neighboring village once a week.  Although she has walked for hours, and has the return walk ahead of her, she is told that she is too late.  A man comes up to interrupt the Doctor's line - about 20 patients ahead of her.  Then I got it.  The long opening camera shot was designed to give me, the comfortable viewer, some sense of the uncomfortable nature of life in these African villages. Although the woman had walked through the desert for hours she was too late - and the Doctor wouldn't be returning for a week. I felt ashamed at being annoyed by the opening 3 1/2 minute shot of the desert.  Director Darrell Roodt had me.  The director of the acclaimed ""Cry, the Beloved Country"" returns with another story that must be told about his native South Africa.

The young mother was ""Yesterday"", played by Leleti Khumalo of ""Hotel Rwanda"", and she was leading her daughter ""Beauty"", played by Lihle Mvelase.  Yesterday is a Zulu, and Roodt makes the film ring true by having the entire film in Zulu, so a warning to those who hate to read subtitles or don't speak Zulu.

It dawns on us that Yesterday has some awful disease - from her coughing at night I at first thought she might have T.B. but we learn that the news is perhaps even worse.  Her husband (in a brief but effective performance by Kenneth Khambula), on one of his rare trips home from the Johannesburg mines, has infected her with H.I.V.

The film never gets preachy.  There are scenes of heart-warming compassion - such as the teacher in her village (played well by Harriet Lenabe) probably only slightly better off financially than impoverished Yesterday, who offers to watch Beauty so that Yesterday can get to the weekly Doctor visit in time in the village on the other side of that long walk we see in the opening scene, then secretly hires a taxi to carry Yesterday even more quickly.  There are also scenes full of painful anguish - with perhaps none worse than the scene where Yesterday tracks down her husband at the mine to give him the news.

We don't get to see pharmaceutical companies and governments and whatever decisions go into making treatment for AIDS available or, perhaps more importantly, affordable.  We get to see a compassionate Doctor (played by Camilla Walker), strapped for resources, who tries to help hundreds of patients. We get to see the villagers who live around Yesterday's hut, and how their growing fear and resentment make Yesterday and her husband outcasts when it becomes clear that they had AIDS.

Yesterday's only hope is that she will live long enough to see Beauty begin school.  My hope is that growing awareness will make fewer Yesterdays.",1138492800,17,3222,4.565217391304348
