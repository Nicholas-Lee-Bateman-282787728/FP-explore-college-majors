8416204,5,B0044M2OPY,"I thought by looking at the jacket image this might be a bit of American Image stroking, and I suppose it is, but this was a fun movie.... and for the date (1916) it is in fact a very well put together peice. But then why not, it was supervised by D.W.Griffith no less! The editing is very good and your not lost once. I don't recall the music being distracting either. The story is reasonably plausible, though as always there is always a bit of ""lucky chance"" to make the story work. But it's clever enough to make sence and seem perfectly feasable.

  The meeting of Fairbanks with the heroin is about as silly as it gets, and I got the feeling it was some Smarmy amigo looking for another notch. But that impression is soon enough erased. But then it's Douglas Fairbanks, so it's a winner... and of course he's as nimble as ever in this movie too.
  Ok one American saving the entire country of ...what now..""PARAGONIA""? is again American Ego stroking in the extreme, but somehow they pull it off and you don't feel like you've been sold an American flag or something.
  and the end is great fun...the villian get his just deserts and the hero get's his girl. Ok campy classic chick flick in some regards, but good clean fun for the whole family. And folks give silents a try...they for the most part have decent stories you don't feel you have to wash your brain out after and hide your children from.
  If your a silent movie collector you won't feel you have to shelve this one but you'll be able to watch in turn with your others over and over.

I never seem to have any problem (yet) with this companies movies loading on my cheap DVD player.",1310515200,3,1651,4.366013071895424
