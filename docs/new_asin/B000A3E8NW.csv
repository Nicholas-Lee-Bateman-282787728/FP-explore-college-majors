8074023,5,B000A3E8NW,Good information on the DVD to help my almost 16 year old granddaughter become a safe driver,1430265600,,92,4.470588235294118
8074024,4,B000A3E8NW,"Some good tips. I got this from the library. It is written for teens ( 16-25) and novice drivers, but applies to drivers of any age. It has statistics and tips. One of the best ones is if you see an animal...brake hard, check your mirrors BUT DRIVE STRAIGHT.  YEP, .that is something I have been told before. Usually you will miss the animal..but if you dont, better you be safe.  They tell you often your reaction is to do something that is not what is best in the situation. IF you know whaty to dio and recognize the situation, you can think back.  THEY explained things too..like how many feet you will travel in say 95 seconds. So they used LOGIC instead of just scare tactics.  The video could have been more but each tip helps. It covered a tons of great ideas and tips.  They explained and had a great visual on hydroplaning. Told you what to do. Ignore those that say this is worthless.  This is ONLY 24 minutes. I have been driving thirty two years and there were things I learned.  I wish there was a transcript of the tips. The company may be out of business, IDK. My video ended abruptly. There was one misspelling....can you find it???  I think it would be great to have the teen watch it, then talk about it.  It would be a good one to rewatch periodically.",1425340800,,1272,4.310924369747899

8074026,5,B000A3E8NW,"plenty of good info, action & talking balanced, keeps students interested. this is my 2nd dvd, the 1st one somehow cracked, but will replace it again if necessary.",1386806400,,163,4.857142857142857
8074027,5,B000A3E8NW,"If you have a teenage driver, in fact if you ARE a driver, this is a great video to review periodically.  There are driving tips in here that help improve driving skills whether you have just started driving or have been hitting the road for 50 years.  Watch it with your kids.",1223078400,,277,4.3076923076923075
8074028,1,B000A3E8NW,"Had the world class racecar drivers featured in this video, who script-read their lines, known what the final production would be like, they would have been reluctant to have their names associated with it.
It is the most useless video on the subject that I have ever seen. Don't waste your time or money.
If you want your teenager to learn something useful, have him/her watch ""The Driving Zone"" from The Dale Earnhardt Foundation featuring Andy Pilgrim and the teens who take part in its comprehensive, hands-on instruction.",1193961600,2,526,4.988636363636363
8074029,1,B000A3E8NW,"What an absolute WASTE of money. This DVD does nothing to help the teen driver.

It has such gems as telling teens not to drink and drive.
WOW, what a great piece of advice, they didn't learn THAT in drivers training.

They also say to look left, right and left again when at a stop sign.  WOW! I never heard that before.

Also, when you drive in fog, turn your lights ON.  AMAZING, I never would have thought of that!

Hope you get my sarcasim but don't waste your money buying it or your time watching it.  I got it from my library so I am not out any money.

My 16 year old could have taught this.

AN ABSOLUTE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.

WISH I COULD GIVE IT ZERO STARS, because that is what it deserves!",1190851200,,706,4.050724637681159
8074030,5,B000A3E8NW,"I recommend this video to anyone with a driver in the home from ages 15 to 21...teaches what they can't learn in a class in a way that's fun for them as well as ""cool"" because it has race car drivers and neat animation.

Two thumbs up!",1147651200,,235,4.0
