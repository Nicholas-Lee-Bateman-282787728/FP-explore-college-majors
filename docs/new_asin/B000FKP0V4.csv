8124076,4,B000FKP0V4,"I grew up in Southern Indiana, and my grandparents were in this tornado, near Griffin, Indiana which was wiped out. So I grew up hearing the stories and watching their faces everytime the sky took on that greenish tint. I really appreciated the interviews with the folks that were there.  Many of them are getting up in years, so its important to record their stories about what happened. This documentary also does a nice job of following the track of the is monster tornado, which was on the ground for a long time in Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana, and supposes that instead of one big tornado, it was more likely a series of multiple vortex tornadoes dropped from one big storm system. I would have given the content five stars, but it gets four because the quality of the burn was a little iffy. The DVD played fine on the computer, but had a couple of sticky spots on my portable DVD player. Highly recommended!",1212796800,,918,4.5636363636363635
