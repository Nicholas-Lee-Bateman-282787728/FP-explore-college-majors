3666400,5,B001KKU9EG,"I can remember my brother, cousins & me being tucked into our sleeping bags in our family room, just in time to watch Saturday Night's Main Event. I grew up watching wrestling in the late 80's & early 90's and I can remember to this day when Sid turned his back on Hogan. There was always a different/special feel about SNME when I was growing up. I preordered this and cant wait to get it today!",1234224000,2,396,4.223684210526316
3666401,5,B001KKU9EG,"I remember when NBC would say ""Saturday Night Live will not be seen tonight,so that we may bring you the following Saturday Night's Main Event programming"" back in the 1980's. Vince Mcmahon has made a lot of bad decisions in the WWE but deciding to release this best of set,is one of the best decisions he has ever made. I pre-ordered this set since last year when it was announced and cannot wait to receive it and start watching it",1233964800,2,433,4.425
3666402,5,B001KKU9EG,"With the exception of the glaring omission of Randy Savage vs. Jake Roberts from '92 (the Miss Elizabeth/Jake blowoff match that included The Undertaker's face turn at the end), this is a flawless match listing... much better than several other recent WWE dvd sets.",1232236800,2,265,5.045454545454546
3666403,5,B001KKU9EG,"Saturday Night's Main Event may be one of the best WWF/WWE dvd releases of all time. Each dvd is jammed packed with matches, interviews, and promos. Mean Gene hosts this set and does a good job. Sure there is some so bad its funny stuff on this set-Piledriver music video, Cousin Elmer's wedding, and my personal favorite Oktoberfest. The funniest line was when Mean Gene tells the Genius, who is acting really gay, he is a master stuffer of sausage. Some matches have been released on dvd before and I own a VHS, Best of Saturday Night's Main Event. The matches are good and there is even two battle royals on here. Alot of matches have the good guy do an interview before the match. I also enjoyed the graphics for each wrestler, something that should do again. It's sad to see how great wrestling was in the 80's and 90's and how it sucks now. Randy Savage is a big part of this set and its awesome to see how great he was back in the day. I highly recommend this set to fans of classic wrestling, when it was done right and the story lines went on for matches and even a year. The newer matches are decent but I would have prefered more older matches. I also hate to see John Cena in a mix of legends on the cover. I'd rather see Million Dollar Man or Bret Hart rather then that loser grace a dvd cover. All in all it's still an awesome set, one of the best WWE has ever released.",1231977600,,1384,4.206766917293233

3666405,2,B001KKU9EG,"Back in the day i used to really look forward to hanging out with friends or family members and watching Saturday Night's Main Event and i wanted to relive some of those memories from back in the day so recently i decided to pick up this dvd set,when it first arrived i took my time watching each disc and after viewing it in its entirety i feel that this is a mediocre dvd set. I was disappointed that there were certain wrestlers and even tag teams that were not featured. I was also disappointed that so many of the matches on this set featured Hulk Hogan,now i don't have anything against Hogan but there were plenty of other wrestlers that could have also been featured and i also didn't care for the filler in between matches that took up time that could have been used for more matches..In ending this review i will say that out of the few Wrestling dvd sets that i have picked up this one in my opinion is one of the worst.",1463788800,,931,4.265536723163842

For those of you that may not have been familiar with wrestling in the 1980s  This would be a good set to get.  The WWF was loaded with the best talent from the USA, Canada, and Europe.  Saturaday Night's Main Event showcased much of that talent and had some of the best and most exciting wrestling of all time.  The only thing that sucks is the few SNME from modern time put on here, it's only 3 matches at the end but they seem like glorified Raw matches and not anything special.  See a ton of legends in their prime, Hulk Hogan, Andre The Giant, Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels, Jake Roberts, Randy Savage, Roddy Piper, Ricky Steamboat, Ted Dibiase, Mr Perfect, and so many more.

3666418,5,B001KKU9EG,"WWE puts out a lot of compellations, many of which are rehashes of older comps or are made up of matches that can be found elsewhere. This is NOT one of those sets. The Best of Sat. Nights Main Event is easily one of my favorite wrestling comps. It is made up of high quality matches and has a lot of unique content. I highly recommend this set to any wrestling fan. It is not one you will regret owning.

Here, I am only going to cover the highspots of the set  and there are quite a few.

HULK HOGAN VS BOB ORTON (WWF Title)  One of the coolest things about this set is that it gives the brick and morter of Hogans reign as champion. Guys like Orton and Funk (see below) did wonders for Hogan. Orton is a extremely underrated wrestler and he demonstrates just how good he was in this match. It is a lot of fun. It isn't really a clinic, but it is good TV and it is always nice to get some matches from guys like Orton sprinkled into these sets.

HULK HOGAN VS TERRY FUNK (WWF Title)  I like this match for a lot of the reasons I like the Hogan v Orton match. Funk was incredible in his prime. This is a rare look at just how good a heal he can be and how great he can make a babyface look.

JAKE ROBERTS VS RICKY STEAMBOAT (Snake Pit Match)  This is another really fun match. Roberts and Steamboat had an amazing feud and this chapter was fantastic. Both of these guys were so good at what they did. While Steamboat was better in NWA/WCW, he had great chemistry with Jake.

JAKE ROBERTS VS RANDY SAVAGE (IC Title)  This is my favorite match in the set. It is masterfully done. Savage is really the star of this set to me but Roberts is a close second and they both put on a fantastic performance here. It was intense, well thought out, and physical.  At a reduced price, I would legit say this match makes the whole thing worth it.

THE HART FOUNDATION VS THE BRITISH BULLDOGS (2/3 Falls)  This is a really fun match, but not quite what I expected. You cant go wrong with these teams. It isn't a five star classic, but it is sharp. I think anytime you get a chance to see Dynamite Kid you should take it. He was so far ahead of his time it is stupid and when he is in with Bret you can see the bar getting raised.

RANDY SAVAGE VS BRET HART  Again, how do you go wrong with these two? This is a deceptively good match actually. Lots of rewatch value.  It feels like a shortened version of what they could have done against each other for the world title in their primes. Bret is very methodical with that realistic snap to his moves and Savage is fluid and wild. Great stuff

MACHO MAN RANDY SAVAGE VS THE MILLION DOLLAR MAN TED DIBIASE  This one isn't my favorite on the set but Savage is always great. The feud between these two was really great and they worked really well together.  You don't want to skip this match and it is great to see the feud filled in with this chapter.

HULK HOGAN VS HARLEY RACE  This match is good, but not great. Race is well past his prime, but it is kind of cool to see him and Hogan in the ring. Race is still great and its a pleasure to watch him work his heel style. WWE will likely never do a Race dvd so this is ust fun to have.

MACHO MAN RANDY SAVAGE VS ANDRE THE GIANT  This is one of my favorite matches in the set. Andre hated Savage for some reason, so he was really stiff. Savage gave it back to him when possible so it made for a really interesting dynamic. It seems somewhat chaotic, but it has a degree of believability to it you don't often get.

THE ROCKERS VS THE BRAIN BUSTERS (2/3 Falls)  Another match featuring two great tag teams. Everyone in this match is good at what they do. Anderson might be the best tag team wrestler ever. The whole match is fun and it delivers.

HULK HOGAN VS MR. PERFECT  This match should have been something we saw a lot more often. Mr. Perfect was absolutely fantastic. Hogan does what Hogan does, but really you watch this match for Perfect and what he brings to it.

BRET HART VS TED DIBIASE  Good solid match between two really good wrestlers. This is another one I doubt you will find on other sets. I am not sure if it is on either of Harts collections, but it is worth having.  If nothing else it is always great to see how great a heel the Million Dollar Man was.

HULK HOGAN & SID JUSTICE VS THE UNDERTAKER & RIC FLAIR  Just star power The match is ok, but just to see this star power in the ring is worth it. WWE had a tendency to do these big weird tag matches for a while. The chemistry wasn't amazing, but you got to see some good match-ups and guys like Flair always shined as they orchestrated so much of what was going on.

BRITISH BULLDOG VS SHAWN MICHAELS  I always thought Bulldog was one of the biggest underachievers ever. He had shining moments in the E and really stepped up his in ring game in the WCW for some reason, but he was always solid, especially with a guy like HBK. Yet another match that probably isn't on a lot of other sets, but you won't be upset with.",1402444800,,4977,4.1233160621761655
3666419,5,B001KKU9EG,"I am happy with my recent purchase of the wwe: the best of Saturday night's main event dvd, the three dvd set contains a lot of good matches from a lot of great wrestling icons from the 80's and 90's. any wrestling fan who purchase the dvd will not be disappointed",1402444800,,264,4.196078431372549

3666425,4,B001KKU9EG,"I watched all 3 discs over the past week.  I didn't specifically remember any of the older matches even though I probably watched a lot of them as a kid.  This is a pretty good mix of matches and other stuff.  The 2 battle royals were fun to watch.  If I had one complaint, it's that we see Hulk Hogan over and over and over.  I know Hulk was wrestling back in the 80's, but would have liked to see a wider range of wrestlers.  There's nothing earth shattering that happened on these discs, but it's fun to see some of the wrestlers I grew up with, and see how far wrestling has come in 25+ years.",1338249600,,597,4.05982905982906
3666426,5,B001KKU9EG,"I am having a blast watching these classic matches from my youth. Great characters, delightfully cheesy skits and solid wrestling that told a story. You will be hard pressed to find a more complete 80's anthology captured in a relatively small 3 dvd set.",1326326400,2,254,4.795454545454546
3666427,3,B001KKU9EG,"It's never been more obvious than it is on this set with the WWE downplaying one of the greatest tag teams of all time's legacy because of a several year old lawsuit that still has Vince McMahon angry.

Very noticeable on this set is the exclusion of the 2 out of 3 falls match between Demolition and the Brain Busters, with the Busters ending the nearly one and a half year reign of the Demolition being tag champs. Also missing is a 3 on 3 tag team match between the 3 members of Demolition (rest in peace Bryan Adams/Crush) and the Legion of Doom and the Ultimate Warrior.

Other than that, it's still a must buy for Hogan fans as you will find several matches on here you can't find elsewhere. But on the downside, most don't feature his promos, and there's lots of repeat Hogan matches that can be found on other sets. We could've used his infamous match instead where he faces Don Muraco and King Kong Bundy injures his ribs or his first SNME match against Bundy. But we all know how the WWE is on their sets, hence I give it only 3 stars.",1323302400,2,1045,4.2727272727272725
3666428,5,B001KKU9EG,"The WWE SNME DVD is a must have. The one word that can be used to sum up this collection is ""fun.""

The set is chock full of great matches. HBK vs. Shane McMahon, The Rockers vs Brain Busters and Steamboat vs. Roberts are particular stand outs.",1313884800,,244,4.191489361702128
3666429,5,B001KKU9EG,"Having been born in the middle of the original SNME run on NBC, I lack the memories of staying up on Saturday night to watch this show. But I am a fan of this era who has walked away from wrestling to a large degree in recent years. That said, this set doesn't have many five star classics, but serves as a beautiful flashback to a time when wrestling was not on up to four-five nights a week and there was no monthly PPV's and became an over-saturated mess. My personal favorites from the set are Savage-Roberts for the IC title from 1986 the psychology was fantastic, Savage-Hart from 1987, the Hogan cage matches with Bossman and Orndorf, with honorable mentions going to the Hart Foundation-Bulldogs, Santana-Perfect, and Hart-Dibiase match from 1991. For me, watching this set easily outclassed 95% of the current WWE product and it was well worth the money.",1282953600,,863,4.684210526315789

3666433,5,B001KKU9EG,"THE BEST OF
SATURDAY NIGHT'S MAIN EVENT

It feels like it was only yesterday when I was watching this on TV when it was first around, glad the WWE is releasing this box set. How great would it be for a full anthology, of course it would have to be released in volumes but still that would be great. Still the greatest thing about this release is that WWE is finally putting Randy Savage on something, hopefully the feud is ending and we can finally get some Macho Man on some DVD's. Between all the matches there are mini doc's and looks back at some classic moments from the show over the years, plus it is cool they left all the original commentary with Jesse Ventura and others.

DISC 1

1. WWF CHAMPIONSHIP-HULK HOGAN VS BOB ORTON-the first main event from the show I believe and it was a great one even though I am no fan of Hogan at all. Still it was wonderful to see Bob Orton during his prime and run with Piper. This is a highly entertaining match that had Orton taking it to Hogan. Piper, Paul Orndorff and Mr. T get involved towards the end of this helping to hype the clash between these five. This was a great start to the DVD set. 5/5

2. RODDY PIPER VS PAUL ORNDORFF-this is more of a brawl between these two here, as these two legends go at it viciously even taking it to the back. Piper who is one off my all time favorites and Mr. Wonderful go from slugging it out in the ring to slugging it out on the outside and even underneath the announcer's booth. This one ends after it goes to the back and Piper escapes. 5/5

3. WWF CHAMPIONSHIP-HULK HOGAN VS TERRY FUNK-a great title match between these two as the Texas hardcore legend almost takes the title from Hogan in a great match. Funk is brilliant in this match as he chokes Hogan with tape and covers it up from sight with his arm. Plus Vince's commentary on this match is hilarious because he was selling Hogan so hard. 5/5

4. BOXING MATCH-MR. T VS BOB ORTON-much like T and Piper did at one time a little later T and Orton would get it on in a boxing match. The match was all about Piper messing with T and leaving him laid out after they jumped him. The match is good and entertaining and the aftermath is just as good. As far as memorable this is a classic as well. 4.5/5

5. SNAKE PIT MATCH-JAKE ROBERTS VS RICKY STEAMBOAT-excellent match between these two as the action goes back and forth. Both show why the are legends of the sport and also shows what Jake used to be. Ricky takes the win as the two face off one with a snake and the other with an alligator [dragon]. Great show for all us fans. 4.5/5

6. WWF I-C CHAMPIONSHIP-JAKE ROBERTS VS RANDY SAVAGE-this possibly the best match on the entire set especially in the psychology department. These two were both rule breakers at the time so both went full force. There is some excellent bending of the rules as well as some great wrestling action. Randy Savage is one of my all time favorite wrestlers of all time and this match shows why. Excellent match that is a classic no doubt, especially the wild ending. 5/5

7. STEEL CAGE MATCH-HULK HOGAN VS PAUL ORNDORFF-as far as cage matches go this is a really entertaining and suspenseful at the end. The story line at the time was great and all logic pointed to this match happening. Both try like crazy to escape the cage and at one point both hit the ground at the exact same time. The match has to be restarted and both go back at it. Hogan goes on to take this one after he lays out The Brain and Mr. Wonderful. Still can't believe Hogan won this. 4.5/5

8. BATTLE ROYAL-this is your typical battle royal that is just there to add a few more wrestlers to the card. The only real purpose of this battle royal is to further the storyline between the great Andre The Giant and Hulk Hogan. That was the real story of this match and Andre showed how much more superior he was to Hogan. That alone makes this a good match, Hercules goes on to win. 3.5/5

9.2 OUT 3 FALLS MATCH-THE HART FOUNDATION VS THE BRITISH BULLDOGS-talk about two great teams that created nothing but classics when against each other. The first fall goes to the Bulldogs after a DQ but they were going at it like crazy. The match from this point would go back and forth as the teams do battle until The Bulldogs get the pin over Jim Neidhart. Unfortunately for them one of their falls was a DQ so the did not get the titles. Excellent match that is full of action. 5/5

10. WWF I-C CHAMPIONSHIP-HONKEY TONK MAN VS RANDY SAVAGE-during Honkey's legendary I-C title reign he would go up against and put the title on the line against the one and only Macho Man Randy Savage. This is a great match between these two that sees Jimmy Hart saving the tile for Honkey on many occasions through out the match. Savage is excellent in this match putting it all on the line but The Hart Foundation come down to give a hand to Honkey Tonk Man. Still the action continues as both give it their all, Savage is amazing as usual. The Hart Foundation hit the ring and attack Savage and cause a DQ. After Tonk pushes her to the ground she runs to the back to grab Hulk Hogan, who comes out to help Randy. 5/5

11. RANDY SAVAGE VS BRET HART-this one is a contender for best match on the set as two of the greatest of all time go head to head. The action is fast paced for the most part and The Anvil makes things even more interesting as he gets involved in this. Savage and Hart tear the house down with this classic that leaves Savage's leg injured. Wonderful match right here and a great way to end the first disc, classic. 5/5

12.[FIRST MATCH ON SNME]-RICKY STEAMBOAT, US EXPRESS VS IRON SHEIK, NIKOLAI VOLKOFF, AND GEORGE STEEL-this is one of the special features on disc one, the first match ever on the show. This was a pretty good match that had a lot of good wrestlers in it, legends. The action was good and well paced and had some high spots. Steel gets pinned after his teammates abandon him. Pretty good match with historical signifigance. 3.5/5

DISC 2

1.[WWF CHAMPIONSHIP] HULK HOGAN VS KING KONG BUNDY-this is a good match up as these two big guys go at it with Andre the Giant in Bundy's corner. The action is back and forth for the most part with Hogan coming out on top most of the time. Until Andre becomes the equalizer and constantly helps Bundy gain the advantage. Still even after a new ref comes out and it looks like Bundy will take of course Hogan gets to Hulk up and get the win with that silly little leg drop. Regardless it is a good match and very entertaining especially with Andre out there choking Hogan like crazy, multiple guys try to get him off and they can't until Hacksaw uses his 2x4. I love the image of Andre with the title while a beaten Hogan is carried to the back5/5

2.[WWF CHAMPIONSHIP] HULK HOGAN VS ANDRE THE GIANT-this is one of the most historic matches in the history of the business, the day The Giant won the title and sold it to Ted Dibiase. Any time Hogan looses it is a good day and a good match this was one of those days. I remember watching this and being extremely excited that Andre had won the match and the title. This still to this day is the most watched match in the history of wrestling I believe is what they said. Andre dominates for the most part and gets the pin fall after a nice slam, still I hate that every time Hogan lost he had to kick out or get an arm up just so it looked like a didn't loose as bad [just watch the end of his Wrestlemania match with Warrior closely during the 3 count]. This was one of the greatest days ever win Andre won, I also love the Million Dollar Man so that was cool to. But of course they couldn't let it be so neither man got the title. 5/5

3. MACHO MAN RANDY SAVAGE VS THE MILLION DOLLAR MAN TED DIBIASE-two of the all time greats and two of my all time favorites go at it in this classic. The action in this one is not surprisingly excellent with a great and quick back and forth pace. For a while Savage starts to get the best of Ted until the ref gets knocked out. That is when Andre gets involved and costs Randy the match as he dominates Savage on the outside, then afterwards Andre, Dibiase, and Virgil attack Savage until Hogan comes to the rescue setting up the mega power connection. 5/5

4. HULK HOGAN VS HARLEY RACE-Harley Race is one of the all time greats with out a doubt and here he is going up against Hogan. Of course Hogan gets the win with that leg drop again but he also cheated to get the win. He attacks Race before the bell and also chokes him with tape from his taped up hand. Still it is a good match and Race shows why he is so good in this match dominating at one point and selling for Hogan. 3.8/5

5.[WWF CHAMPIONSHIP] MACHO MAN RANDY SAVAGE VS ANDRE THE GIANT-oh yeah Savage is back in action up against Andre with the world title on the line, naturally you know this one is good. Things start off well for Andre as he takes the lead and puts it to Savage wearing him down. Things turn in Savage's favor when Jake the Snake comes down to ringside and hides the snake under the ring. Things get real interesting after The Brain is thrown from the ring and Andre gets caught in the ropes. He is so scared of the snake and makes a quick get away. 5/5

6.[I-C CHAMPIONSHIP] ULTIMATE WARRIOR VS HONKEY TONK MAN-this is a pretty good match that sees Honkey trying to get his title back and start a second reign as I-C champ. The action is good and it works out much like all of Warrior's other matches. Warrior takes this one after a little while. 4/5

7. TWIN TOWERS VS MEGA POWERS-the match that ended it all for the Mega Powers and started one of the most historic feuds of all time, one that went into real life. This is a great match with the Powers in control for the first part of the match taking it to the Towers. But once it is turned around it stays there for the most part. Then Savage is thrown into Miss Elizabeth and Hogan takes her to the back and leaves Savage to fend for himself. Savage continues the match until Hogan comes back out at which point Randy slaps Hulk and leaves him there to finish the match. Of course Hogan gets to Hulk up and gets the win after a leg drop. Afterwards Hogan goes to check on Elizabeth and is destroyed by Savage, I loved it. 5/5

8.[STEEL CAGE-WWF CHAMPIONSHIP]HULK HOGAN VS BIG BOSS MAN-this match helped hype up Hogan's movie at the time with Zeus so of course Zeus was there. But as for the match its self it was a good one with some good action. Cage matches are always interesting even these ones with the old blue style cage, in fact I kinda miss those. Hogan wins this one after cuffing Boss Man to the ropes. 4/5

9.[BEST 2 OUT OF 3 FALLS] THE ROCKERS VS THE BRAIN BUSTERS-two of the greatest tag teams off all time do battle in this one here. Two of the original Horsemen vs my favorite HBK and his partner at the time Marty Janetty. This match is strength and technique against speed and athleticism. The Rockers pick up the first fall fairly quickly after Marty pins Tully. After that we are treated to some of the best wrestling action of the time as the Rockers hit all kinds of double team moves. But it is the Brain Busters that get the pin fall. Then we are treated to even more great action with The Brain Busters controlling most of it this time, still the Rockers get the pin fall and the win after HBK lands a high flying cross body block on Arn Anderson. 5/5

10. DUSTY RHODES VS BIG BOSS MAN-this match saw the debut of Sapphire when she comes into the ring as ""a fan"" to help Dusty dance. The match is pretty good with Boss Man taking the early advantage and controlling the pace. Dusty still pulls out the victory though with Pokka dots and all. 3.5/5

DISC 3

1. HULK HOGAN & THE ULTIMATE WARRIOR VS MR. PERFECT & THE GENIUS-Hogan and Warrior  dominate most of the beginning of this match over powering their opponents. That is until the Genius gave Perfect a metal scroll to nail Hogan with. At one point Perfect had Hogan beat with the perfectplex but he let Hogan up, which led to Genius being dropped by Warrior. Then catching an awkward leg drop from Hogan since he had to get the pin. Afterwards Hogan and Warrior go at it after a misunderstanding. 4/5

2. HULK HOGAN VS MR. PERFECT-this is actually one really good match although it shouldn't be a surprise since Mr. Perfect is in it. But the surprise is that Hogan actually does well in this and even sells for Perfect [a rare thing for Hogan]. This is a great back and forth battle that sees both men looking good at one time or another. Hogan brawls and goes for power moves while Perfect out wrestles him. It is no surprise that Hogan wins this match but for him this is a classic. 5/5

3. ROCKERS VS HART FOUNDATION-oh yeah two of the greatest teams of all time go at it in the early days of Bret vs HBK. My boy Shawn and his partner Marty Janetty were up against my brother's favorite wrestler Bret Hart and his partner Jim Neidhart. There is a lot of good double team moves and some great back and forth quick action. After a while tag champs at the time Demolition come down to ring side and eventually interfere in the match. The match ends in a double DQ but still it was a great match. 5/5

4.[WWF I-C CHAMPIONSHIP] MR. PERFECT VS TITO SNATANA-this is a great back and forth battle for the I-C title that sees Tito get many near falls. Still Perfect pulls through with a great small package. These two showed why they are two of the greatest to ever grace the ring. Tito looked like he was going to pull this one out at various points but it was not meant to be. 4.5/5

5.20 MAN BATTLE ROYAL-I like any one else enjoy a good battle royal every now and then and this one was an entertaining one. When I was watching this back then of course I was pulling for HBK or Mr. Perfect and was thrilled when Hogan was eliminated. Of course the two people I was going for gave the best showings in the match and both made it to the final four. Of course I was excited when Perfect won the battle royal, excellent in deed. 5/5

6. BRET HART VS TED DIBIASE-we are treated to another great match that pits two more legends against each other. Two great technicians went against each other in this great battle were Roddy Piper would play a funny role in it. Still the match ends in a double count out when both men brawl on the outside. 5/5

7. HULK HOGAN & SID JUSTICE VS THE UNDERTAKER & RIC FLAIR-this is full of star power with four of the biggest stars and legends in the business, yes that includes Sid. Taker and Flair actually control most of the match working over Hogan most of the time, but it is when Sid feels betrayed by Hulk that things get real interesting. After refusing to tag in Sid leaves the ring and walks to the back. At this point Flair gets disqualified after throwing the ref. 4.5/5

8.[WWF I-C CHAMPIONSHIP] BRITISH BULLDOG VS SHAWN MICHAELS-oh you know I love this one and consider it a classic since it is the first time HBK won a singles title in the WWF. This is a great match between these two rivals that has some great psychology in it. Notice that the entire match HBK works on Bulldog's back setting up that toss into the exposed turnbuckle. Bulldog's back can't take it any more and gives way when he attempts a superplex. Shawn wins the I-C title on the last episode of Saturday Night's Main Event. 5/5

9.[STREET FIGHT] SHAWN MICHAELS VS SHANE MCMAHON-this is when the show returned to the air after something like 13 years. While it did now feel like the same show from this on it still was a cool live event that all fans enjoyed. Before HBK and Vince did this at Mania a little later his son Shane would go at it with Shawn in a street fight. This was a pretty good match and while not a classic still a fun match, the highlight of course is the suplex through the tables. Shane wins with a bogus submission victory ala Bret Hart. 4.5/5

10. DX VS THE SPIRIT SQUAD-this match happened during the DX reunion tour as I like to call it and was part of their feud with Vince and the spirit squad. At times it was ok and at times it was great, this match fell in between the two. This isn't a classic wrestling match per say as much as it is like the last one, just fun. After every member of the squad is eliminated they get locked in a cage, even Vince ends up in there. 4/5

11.[WWF CHAMPIONSHIP] EDGE VS JOHN CENA-I am a fan of both of these guys and think that their feud was probably the best going during that time period. This turned out to be a good match but they had much better compared to this one. Still there was some good enough action in this with a DQ win for Cena. The FU through the table of the steps saves this one a little. 4/5

This is an excellent set that every wrestling fan should own, really this could be the best set that WWE has released. Matter of fact I believe that it is now we need that Randy Savage set.",1241481600,24,16881,4.243773349937734

The show's success produced a Friday spin-off prime time show on NBC, The Main Event, with the February 5, 1988, bout again featuring Hogan and Andre drawing 33 million viewers (15.2 rating).

Ratings began to slip in 1991 and FOX aired the final two espisodes, the last shown on October 27, 1992. The program returned to NBC in 2006 for periodic prime time specials.

I for one grew up on watching Satuday Main event.  The wwe should have never included the recent matches on the dvds I mean I can understand them wanting to update the concept but they already have some of these matches already on dvds for other wrestlers like Edge's dvd or DX dvd.  Also in place of the 2006 matches they should have included more matches dealing with the 80s and 90s.  The matches they have on the dvd is a good line up I have to admit and I for one will probably say to anyone interested in the history of the WWE to go out and buy this thing.,1237680000,2,741,3.97972972972973

May '85

Roddy Piper vs. Paul Orndorff - Piper always seemed to have a grand entrance around this time but that's all that was grand here as Jesse Ventura described this match perfectly being a ""street fight with ropes around it"" as you could count the number of wrestling moves on one hand from start to finish with this getting so out of control that it went from the ring to ringside to under the announce booth all the way to the backstage area with them trying to use whatever they could get their hands on & everyone getting out the way.

[Born To Controversy: The Roddy Piper Story]

WWE Champion Hulk Hogan vs. Terry Funk - Due to the constant interference by Jimmy Hart in their previous encounter, Hogan got the assistance of Junkyard Dog in his corner who chased around Jimmy & forced him to sit in a chair at ringside. Hogan easily overpowered Funk early on easily countering & reversing his offense while also having some entertaining moments like running over Funk when crossing the ropes & the way Funk fell out of the ring that just had you just couldn't help but laugh at while Jimmy Hart had to get involved in order to give Funk an advantage while also using dirty tactics like using the wrist tape & branding iron to keep the advantage. This was a very entertaining match.

Boxing Match: Mr. T. vs. Bob Orton - Roddy Piper was in Orton's corner as both men were just slugging each other with Orton constantly resorting to illegal tactics throughout the match & even between the rounds only for T to keep taking advantage whenever Orton couldn't control his ego with Piper making his presence known from the outside in one of the best ""boxing"" matches I've seen with wrestlers but was ultimately a preview of what was to come at WrestleMania II.

Snake Pit Match: Ricky Steamboat vs. Jake Roberts - Roberts had his snake ""Damien"" in his corner while Steamboat had his own pet dragon in his as Steamboat was working over the arm with his trademark armdrags & chops while playing his own mind games with his pet while Jake heavily focused on an area of the body taking the air away from him as this was a competitive match that told a good story in the ring along with their own pets adding to the match.
Oct. '86

WWE Intercontinental Champion Randy Savage vs. Jake Roberts - Both men started out very intense showing that they have no issues with breaking the rules & executed the same strategy of offense against each other with Savage constantly avoiding the DDT plus using Elizabeth to his advantage when possible while Roberts played games of intimidation as the match got more intense but stayed so evenly match as it went on that the action became harder to control with the big story coming out of the match being that neither man were fan favorites going into this match with one man gained the crowd's support coming out of it.

WWE Champion Hulk Hogan vs. Andre The Giant - It took close to a year but this was the rematch due to the controversial nature of the first match however this match was held under different circumstances as Ted Dibiase had hired Andre to win the title for him from Hogan. Hogan went after Dibiase & his bodyguard Virgil before targeting Andre but couldn't knock him off his feet to the point where he got desperate & went out of his element that allowed Andre to gain the advantage before a move was so impactful that knocked one out of the ring & the other to the floor as Hogan was able to regain control but still had to deal with outside factors in Dibiase & Virgil allowing Andre to once again take advantage where another factor became the deciding one resulting in this match being shorter than the Mania match but always remembered for the controversial outcome.

Hulk Hogan vs. Harley Race - Hogan was out looking for revenge against Bobby Heenan for selling the contract of Andre The Giant to Ted Dibiase, resulting in Hogan losing the WWE Championship in controversy, and that showed as he went right after Heenan only for Race to jump Hogan coming into the ring with no effect as Hogan used his taped fist to punch Race while also using whatever he could get his hands on like the ring post & choking using the tape on his fist while continuing to brawl on the floor. Heenan caused a distraction allowing Race to finally get some control using a piledriver & an attempt at a big splash through an announce table that unfortunately would have a long term effect on Race. This match served it's purpose in showing a more aggressive dominate Hogan than ever after losing the championship but is more remembered for the injury Harley Race suffered via the big splash through a table that caused him to be out of action for close to a year.

[Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story]

Street Fight Match: Shawn Michaels vs. Shane McMahon - Shawn started out attacking Shane from behind on the ramp down to ringside where he was able to reverse whip Shawn into the ring post before setting up a ladder in the ring while Vince setup a table on the outside only for both men to come off the ladder & crash through the table but Shane was able to recover using the ladder as a weapon against Shawn's back & delivering a chairshot with Vince getting involved whenever possible using a kendo stick against Shawn & causing distractions in favor of Shane but also ended up getting involved one too many times where it backfired when Shane went for the ""Coast To Coast"" with a trash can allowing Shawn to come back with his trademark maneuvers only for Vince to once again get Shawn to focus on him allowing Shane to take advantage & have a case of ""deja vu"" occur when he had Shawn in a certain submission hold. This was a fun match.

[WrestleMania 22]

Elimination Match: D-Generation X vs. Spirit Squad - This was a 2 vs. 5 handicap match with the special stipulation that the eliminated team members must be placed in a holding cell at ringside as DX had fun at the expense of the various members of the group such as using their props & eliminating members within seconds before a distraction allowed the Squad to attempt to use their numbers advantage in what was an entertaining match if you are fans of DX.

[The New & Improved DX]

WWE Champion Edge vs. John Cena - The tension between both men caused this fight to start out on the floor before making it into the ring where they traded fist & moves that not only hurt their opponent but at one point caused both men to ""crash & burn"" with Lita on the outside as well trying to get involved in the action as this match was very short but was all about who was left standing at the end.
July '06

(Bonus) Ricky Steamboat & U.S. Express vs. Iron Sheik, Nikolai Volkoff, George Steele - Freddie Blassie & Capt. Lou Albano were opposing managers at ringside as Steamboat & The Express were very dominate singling out one member of the opposing team causing their opponents to keep having issues with each other to the point where one man was being blamed for everything happening as this was only memorable for not only being the first ever match on Saturday Night's Main Event but also the beginnings of one of the lovable fan favorites during this period of time.
May '85

(Bonus) Dusty Rhodes vs. Big Boss Man - Dusty came to ringside with his own nightstick as Boss Man took advantage of a distraction with Slick on the outside getting his shots in as well with the match being taken to the floor & Boss Man focusing on a specific part of the body before another unlikely distraction worked in Dusty's favor as this was another quick match that was memorable for being the first appearance of someone who would become an important part of Dusty's WWE career.
Nov. '89

This isn't a DVD full of 5 star classic wrestling matches but a mixed of lost classics in either quality, emotional/memorable moments, and just classic entertainment of the then-World Wrestling Federation. If you were a heavy fan of WWE during the mid-80's to early 90's then you don't want to miss this walk down memory lane but for newer fans, I would still recommend because this was just great entertainment in & out of the ring overall.",1234569600,21,21324,4.613132911392405
3666442,5,B001KKU9EG,This is a must own dvd for any fan of classic pro wrestling. They did a really good job on the way each dvd is set up. Now every day of the week can be Saturday for me :),1234224000,,170,3.3846153846153846
3666443,5,B001KKU9EG,"When Saturday Night's Main Event debuted on NBC in 1985 it marked the return of professional wrestling to network television after being absent for decades and it drew monster ratings and set records that still stand today. Because PPV events didn't exist at the time, Saturday Night's Main Event was the only way to see top WWF wrestlers facing of against each other on television, and for the time the show really delivered some tremendous and unforgettable matches from the height of Hulk Hogan's break-out run as WWF champion that launched the Rock-n-Wrestling era in WWF that gave birth to WrestleMania. However, since most fans were probably kids when these matches originally aired, you have to ask if this is a mere trip down memory lane or are these matches actually as good as some may remember (or think they remember).

The good news is for the most part, the matches are pretty good. Don't get me wrong, you won't find any match of the year candidates, but where the matches lacked in ring work quality, they exceled in entertainment value. Most of these matches, especially from the first 3 years, were booked to the strengths of the wrestlers involved and were designed to tell entertaining stories, further storylines and create compelling angles. So you're going to get fun and exciting matches with that big time ""main event"" feel. Also, you will get a handful of surprisingly good, and possibly forgotten classic matches.

Mean Gene Okerlund hosts this DVD set and walks us thru the shows best moments in chronological order. Most of the matches include the pre-match interviews just as they originally aired, which is the best thing about this set. They could've just shown the matches from the beginning of the bell, but they included all the pre-match hype, which was one of the coolest things about Saturday Night's Main Event.
They also included some of the more memorable, or awful (depending on your point of view), skits from the show. Unfortunately, WWE decided not to purchase the rights to use ""Obsession"" by Animotion, which was the more popular theme song from the show. It's been replaced with one of the cheesiest and lamest attempts at '80s synth pop I've ever heard! But this set is all about the matches, and there are some good ones here...

Some reviewers have complained about the omission of Jake the Snake vs. Randy Savage from 1991 (early 1992?), but I'm glad that match wasn't included, because as I remember it was pretty dull. Instead, they included Jake the Snake vs. Randy Savage for the Intercontinental Title from 1986. This is an underrated classic in my opinion. Jake introduces the match and he calls it the best match both he and Randy had up to that point in their careers. I wouldn't go that far, but it's still a great match between two hot heels at the time.
Another rare match that's included is Bret Hart vs. Randy Savage. This is an excellent bout between two of the best workers in the company at the time. Randy Savage shines as the star he was and we got a glimpse into the brilliant singles career that was on the horizon for Bret Hart.
Tag team action is also well represented with two classic 2-out-of-3 fall matches that feature The Hart Foundation vs. the British Bulldogs and the Rockers vs. the Brain Busters (Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard for those who forgot their brief WWF run).
Epic angles are also included such as Hulk Hogan losing his first WWF title against Andre the Giant and the break-up of the Mega-Powers when Randy Savage turned on Hulk Hogan in a tag match against the Twin Towers (Big Boss Man and Akeem a.k.a. One Man Gang).
It's hard to argue with the matches that were selected for this set, but for my money, I would have loved to have seen Hogan vs. Orndorff because that was the match were ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper officially turned face after being the most hated man in the promotion for years. Piper vs. Adrian Adonis would've been cool to see again too, where Adrian blinded Piper leading into their WrestleMania III match. However, all in all, this is a near perfect release.

With this release, the Starrcade DVD set and the Legends of Wrestling DVDs being released in the first quarter of 2009, I really can't see WWE coming out with anything else all year that can top these compilation DVDs. The only other comp release I'm looking forward to is the Wrestling Stars of the '90s set which will come pretty close.
For old school wrestling fans, it doesn't get any better than this Saturday Night's Main Event DVD set and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-Starrcade-The-Essential-Collection/dp/B001H5X6SK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE Starrcade: The Essential Collection</a>&nbsp;DVD set.

8315222,5,B001KKU9EG,"Here are 6 things that ran through my head as I watched this really fun set.

Jesse Ventura was the greatest heel announcer ever.

Miss Elizabeth had incredible star power.  The second you see her walking down the aisle it just takes the show to a whole other level

WWE of the 21st century has much more in common with ECW than it does with the WWF heyday of the late 80's.

I'd forgotten how good Jim ""The Anvil"" Neidhart was.  He faded after Bret Hart went solo but he was explosive and powerful in the tag team setting.

Demolition seemed so intimidating when I was a kid.  Now they just seem silly to me.  A couple over overweight guys in bondage gear and face paint and nowhere near the same level of coolness as the Road Warriors.

I would have loved to have been an adult in 1985-1987 and attended a live WWF event.  The crowds were so rowdy back then.

In closing, this was a great purchase, worth every penny.  I remember vividly looking forward to watching Saturday Night's Main Event as a child and this brought back so many great memories.",1526256000,,1052,4.360824742268041
