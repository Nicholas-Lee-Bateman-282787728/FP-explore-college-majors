6432659,2,B00KITEHVQ,Just watched this movie and I`m sad to say that this is another crappy video game to love movie waste of time. The story is junk and only there to connect the fight scenes. Kane Kosugi is a good martial artist but he`s the only good thing in this movie. Gary Danial`s role is small and wasted. Buy Tekken vengeance instead and forget this movie.,1407715200,8,345,4.323076923076923

6432661,2,B00KITEHVQ,"The fact that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tekken/dp/B003ZHVJFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tekken</a>&nbsp;was not a perfect movie isn't shocking, but it is surprising how significantly worse its successor is. Director Wych Kaos is not exactly known for making great films and his video game movie does not bolster his reputation. Kazuyas Revenge is not so much an adaptation as a lazy spinoff, and though it does some things very well, its deficiencies are overwhelming and make this an unenjoyable outing for all but niche viewers.

The story: Haunted by confusing memories, an amnesiac martial artist (Kane Kosugi) is kidnapped by a crime organization and turned into an assassin.

The best thing that can be said about this movie is that Kane Kosugi is, at least, a much more apt choice for the lead role than Ian Anthony Dale was before him. A stellar performer just coming off one of the best fight scenes of the decade in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ninja-II/dp/B00FRILRRK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ninja II</a>, Kosugi does what he does best in delivering fights that range from endurable to pretty good. The low number of characters from the series limits the dream matchups this one can present (and the one it does give us  Kosugi versus Gary Bryan Fury Daniels  is rubbish), but Kane manages some respectable bouts with genre regulars Ron Smoorenburg, Eoin OBrien, and Brahim Achabbakhe. Karate fans won't be completely bored.

Normally, my satisfaction for that regard would garner at least an average rating, but the movie is a metaphor for how a table cannot stand on only one leg. Aside from the fact that the plot in no way resembles the Tekken series and would probably make more sense without the label, the screenplay of Kazuyas Revenge appears to have been written with a license to pad and instructions to only tell a fractional story... Many scenes are given over to time-killing flashbacks and montages of Kazuya aimlessly wandering around. The motivations of and relationships between characters are frustratingly enigmatic. Several times, Kazuya will enter a new locale, and with some unclear understanding known only to the characters, he will engage in an unprompted and unexplained fight scene. The movie ends without any resolution, clearly teasing another sequel that I hope will not see production  at least not under the same director.

The upcoming reboot - The King of the Iron Fist Tournament - will constitute the third Tekken-inspired feature within a decade, and the fact that fans are a lot less happy about this than youd assume says a lot about the missed opportunities of the series as a film franchise. The creative decisions this particular one makes are genuinely frustrating, and sends the impression that not only did the producers not care about representing the characters, they did not even care about telling a coherent story. Perhaps the politics of direct-to-video filmmaking are to blame, but no one ought feel compelled to sit through this.",1445644800,3,3090,5.425
6432662,3,B00KITEHVQ,"Soft plot spoiler review, I give you an idea about the ending, although I omit the details.

K (Kane Kosugi) escapes from a swat team that can only come at him two at a time, although there are a dozen of them coming up the stairs. He leaps from his hotel room, bumps his head and joins an assassin cult group lead by The Minister (Rade Serbedzija). K kills for the minister, or else the janitor (Sahajak Boonthanakit) dies... and he dies too because there is an explosive in his chest. K has amnesia and flashbacks which likewise have nothing to do with the first film. K, who is not an MIB,  wants out.

I am not sure how this tied into the first film other than the fact it takes place in the same city. There is less arena style fighting, i.e. the actually create a story instead of imitating a video game where you just fight. The end starts to get twisted and  confused.

This ""sequel"" which isn't, was released 4 years after the first film so it may be a good thing that the two are not related...just kidding. Now it does leave us open for what promises to be an exciting Tekken 3 as he and the killer girl (Kelly Wenham) will have to take on the big cheese (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) who was little more than a cameo.

Guide: No swearing. Implied sex. No real nudity. Women dancing in bikinis. Biljana Misic in a school uniform sucking on a pink Dum-Dum and dry humping, so the film wasn't all bad.",1427587200,,1403,4.295454545454546

6432665,1,B00KITEHVQ,"Only recently I stumbled over part one and discovered, that there ist a second part too. I'm over 40, so I have played the games and I was curious to find out, how they managed it to get it onto film. First of all - the first one isn't a masterpiece for sure, but while it had kind of a story and cool fights, it is almost impossible to describe the second one. Over the half of the movie is in slow motion, or glimpses to the past of our hero, and/or glimpses to the past of our hero in slow motion (that includes recently fighted opponents). You can even see a girl stir a tomato-sauce in slow motion. They probably wantend to create some kind of suspension, or to make the viewer curious. But I think it is only because they wanted to reach a total runtime of 90 minutes. Otherwise the movie would have ended after only 30 minutes, which would have been a relief. All of it is so annoying that you wanna press the stop button, get the Disc out, stomp a few times on it and throw it into the bin. The story is fast told: Kazuya awakes without memory, get's recruited to become a killer and he tries to find out what happened to him (that is where you see endles slow motions and running always around the same places). Why it is called ""Kazuya's Revenge"" lies beyond my imagination. There is no revenge. At the end Kazuya discovers that Heihachi is his father and then he fights two punks and that's it. Heihachi is now preparing for them or him (as he says) to come. So will the next one be titled ""Tekken: Kazuya's Revenge - now for real"", or what? Anyway, don't waste precious time with that movie. Only consolation I had after watching it was that I was badly sick and didn't exprected to watch a brainer -  but was worse anyway.",1424390400,2,1735,4.241691842900302
6432666,1,B00KITEHVQ,"If you have seen the first tekken movie and knowing how bad that sucked, your gonna have to expect similar content going into see this one and be very disappointed. This movie overall felt like a waste for the 90% of its runtime and comes nowhere near to the first movie. This sequel to this very inferior movie franchise was a lot worse than it's predecessor. It's a very boring flick and the storyline is very non existent to the point that it doesn't captivate you in anyway. This film was low budget but still shouldn't have sucked so bad. This movie was slow paced, had nothing to do with the video game of which it's based upon and very poor fighting scenes and sequences. In conclusion this movie was just trash and had nothing to offer and i'm not kidding when i say this is a bad flick. If your're an avid tekken fan stay well clear of this trash, and to think people said that the super mario bros. and the street fighter movie of the 90's was bad.",1423872000,,958,4.298342541436464
6432667,1,B00KITEHVQ,NOTHING like the first one.  Was not a fan.,1423440000,,43,3.7777777777777777
6432668,1,B00KITEHVQ,LOL.  The trailer is terrible!  I'm not even sure who that guy is supposed to be.  I wouldn't watch this movie even if it were free.,1417392000,,132,4.0
6432669,3,B00KITEHVQ,"This movie isn't as bad as people may say it is. Look at how these people write their reviews. Really? One or two sentence for reviews don't mean anything. What the hell do these people mean, when they say they will give it 0 zero stars if they could without telling others what they mean by that? What do they mean the story doesn't make any sense without telling what the story is about? Really these people could do better then that.

So, let me shad some light on things. I understood about 95% of the movie. This movie started out okay, got better in the middle, then it gets confusing at the end. So, the movie wasn't all too bad. Some people can't just get pass the ending, I guess. So, the movie focuses on Kazuya only. It has nothing to do with the first movie. This movie is a back story before the first Tekken Tournament ever happens. This would be the first tournament, so it's NOT the movie tournament that you saw from the first movie. That movie looks like it takes place several years later after Kazuya's kid is all grown up.

The movie starts off with Kazuya and he has lost his memory. The only thing he knows how to do is to fight. We see him wake up in a hotel somewhere and he is all confused about how he got there. Then, a few second later he gets attacks from soldiers that want to capture him, but he manages to get away. Then, he gets run over by a car and passes out. When he wakes up again, he then finds himself in a prison like environment. He meets this person calling himself the Minister. The Minister is supposed to be the head boss there. He gives Kazuya the name K by luck because it was the next letter in the alphabet list for naming people. (Guess he has meet a lot of people that forgot their names.) Then, K passes out again because he get's the letter K branded on his body after the Minister names him.

K now wakes up again and slowly finds out that the Minister needs highly skilled fighters to be his operatives to go on secret missions. K has to prove himself that can be one by fighting people in the prison. Once he proved himself, he gets set up somewhere in a city close by the prison. He will get missions by Ronda, another operative of the Minister.

Now the middle of the movie is about K living his days as a operative of the Minster. K spends most of his free time at his apartment retracing his last memory, where he woke up in a hotel. He searches the web and goes to each one of the hotels that he thinks might be the hotel that he woke up at. When Ronda goes to K to do a mission, K doesn't really want to kill people, but he does it because he is protecting a person back at the prison.  K continues to live his life at the apartment doing his missions and trying to find the hotel that he first woke up at. Then, one day, K takes a walk around his apartment and he comes across his neighbor Laura. (A very sweet  innocent looking type of girl.) Laura being attacked by these muggers that want to hurt her and mug her. K stops them with ease and Laura appreciate this.

Towards the middle end of the movie, K and Laura has grown found of each other and they start liking each other a lot...eventually leading towards the bed room. Where it gets hot and heavy. If you know what I mean. he he After that, Brain Fury comes into the picture. He has hacked K room somehow, after K failed to kill Brain earlier and let Brain get away. Then, it turns out that Brain used to be one of the Minister operative as well, but he got out. K wants to get out too and wants Brain to help him, but Brain only tells K how to get out, but he doesn't directly get involved with this. Ronda is there too and she will help K get out. They do this by going after the Minster and his people The Minster is easily killed with no problem.

Now, this is the part where it starts getting confusing. When K and Ronda go back to get Laura to leave, they discover that Laura has been capture by someone that left a card telling them where they can find Laura at. K goes saves Laura with Ronda help. So, what's kind of confusing about this is that the people that they fight when they get to the place is the Minster henchmen. I don't know really know why they needed to be there fighting K and Ronda. Minster is dead, so they could had all left the prison but instead here they are trying to kill K and Ronda. For the Minster's revenge or are they just too crazy? Who knows.

After K and Ronda beat up the henchmen. K then finds out who he is and why he lost his memory. Now enter, Heihachi. Heihachi tells K that he is his father and brainwash K to forget everything after they fought. Then, Laura comes in dresses all slutty and kisses Heihachi. I think Laura kissed Heihachi because he was brainwashed her and then, he killed her because he just wanted to make Kazuya feel defeated and week. That's my guess.

After Heihachi kills Laura, Kazuya trys to fight Heihachi, but we learn in this movie he has special teleporting skills? Because he teleports right out of there and leaves Kazuya with his rage and defect. Then, Kazuya and Ronda leave the building. Heihachi has the final scene with him talking with his mad boss. He says something like he be waiting for Kazuya and let the games begin. Then, you see the colosseum right behind him and this is where the very first Tekken will be held. The end.

This movie is a 3 star movie. It just couldn't finish at the end. I really like how it developed in the middle, but it looked like they rushed the movie at the end. That's where people start questions what going on because everything before that was great. It looks like they didn't really have the time to do it right. I know they have to give K a bad ending, but at least do it right. I wouldn't mind seeing another Tekken movie.",1417305600,6,5771,4.19009009009009
6432670,1,B00KITEHVQ,"Although this movie had very low ratings, I thought I would give it a try.

Having seen the first Tekken movie which was a 3 out of 5 star, I was thinking I might get at least that out of this movie.

First, this movie actually does nothing for the Tekken story line or to build upon the first movie.  The story script was very amateurish , lacked clear direction, unconventional, and had various other flaws.

Second, had the script been of any interest, the 'look' of the movie detracted from the story.

If 0 out of 5 stars were possible, my rating would be 0.",1414454400,,563,4.273584905660377
