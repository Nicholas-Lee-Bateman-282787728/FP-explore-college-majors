i will buy 2.

thank you.",1302998400,28,208,4.333333333333333
4460447,4,B004RCGQSC,"I can't really review this product in particular since I don't yet own it, but I have seen all the episodes from both seasons and loved them all.  I definitely plan on getting this when it becomes available.

This show combines clever, hilarious, and absurd with great comic pacing and a bizarre story that explores not one, but two seperate reality shows featuring a smug jerk who's almost too dumb and clueless to be forgiven for his behaviour, and a Russian mobster who fails at both being a hitman and a standup comic.  Great original stuff that you will want watch again and again and enjoy each time.",1301270400,14,606,4.592592592592593
4460448,5,B004RCGQSC,"This show can only be described as hilarious. The main character is supposed to be a jerk. But that's what makes him funny. He thinks the world is his fun place. He says the most outrageous things. And Little Spock (Jacob Kogan) is cool too, he plays Jon's son. Even people in North Ska-kota will like it!",1300147200,12,305,4.368421052631579

4460454,5,B004RCGQSC,This show is hilarious. Definitely worth having in my dvd collection. And the reduced price just sweetened the deal.,1427068800,,116,5.157894736842105
4460455,4,B004RCGQSC,"Package came on time; but condition-wise, once the DVD was unwrapped I noticed roughly an inch incision over the bar code running vertically on the back of the dvd case. Thankfully the cut didn't fully make it through and the DVDs weren't damaged.",1423526400,,247,4.767441860465116

4460461,5,B004RCGQSC,Delocated is one of the funniest shows I have ever seen and I never get tired of watching it. Definitely a great buy.,1403222400,,117,4.130434782608695
4460462,5,B004RCGQSC,"One of the funniest shows in the last decade, Delocated joins shows like Arrested Development and 30 Rock for intelligent, irreverent writing that makes the silliest, stupidest stuff gut-bustingly funny. Jon Glazer (Parks and Recreation) is spectacular as ""Jon,"" but the real genius of the show is giving ""Jon"" the voice modulation that makes the ridiculous stuff that comes out of his mouth even more ridiculous. Though the show ended much too early, we are lucky to have what we got, and in many ways, it crystallizes the show in its near-perfect glory. Buy it. Laugh your ass off. Come back for more.",1375142400,3,603,4.864077669902913
4460463,5,B004RCGQSC,It is the strange adult humor you come to expect from a cartoon network show like this but also has a Arrested Development type pace to it. Pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.,1365638400,5,186,4.3428571428571425
4460464,5,B004RCGQSC,"Love this show, it's sad how quickly it ended. I highly recommend it to everyone. Can't wait for the season 3 DVD.",1365552000,,114,4.2272727272727275
4460465,5,B004RCGQSC,If you have never heard of this show you will die with laughter.  It's my favorite show.  No it's not your average cable comedy show...which is why it's soooo funny!  Do yourself a favor and watch a few episodes.,1363910400,,212,4.384615384615385
4460466,4,B004RCGQSC,"When I first saw parts of this show on Adult Swim, I was not sold right away.  After catching more and more episodes, it has become one of my favorites on TV.  Jon Glaser's ""Jon"" character makes the show.",1362700800,,204,4.205128205128205
4460467,4,B004RCGQSC,"After viewing The creators' previous efforts, I was quite surprised by the level of quality of story and characters in Delocated. Although, it is rather silly, due mostly to Mr. Glaser and his portrayal of the completely oblivious and over-the-top jerk that usually lucks out (kind of), despite all the odds against him. This show appeals directly to fans of shows like Home Movies (H. John Benjamin and Glaser were comedy partners at one time), Mr. Show, and anything of the new-age comedy era. While, to me, some jokes and efforts fall flat or come out quite bland (especially for standards set by PFFR in the past), I see this as a pre-cursor to what may come in the future for the cast and crew in larger and more elaborate projects. Take it to the bone-zone.",1332892800,,763,4.617647058823529
4460468,5,B004RCGQSC,"Ya, everyone says that about their favorite show, but we still wade through a lot of crap to find them.  Hats off to Adult Swim!  Jon's writing is just so creative and over the top, and I can't help but laugh at practically every move the guy makes on screen. And Jon (the character) goes through some Serious S*** in life!

I've never even thought about writing a review for a television series, but this one is really really exceptional and you need to see it.

To quote our beloved Jon from the new season, ""You want some advice?  Don't die!!!""

Don't die folks.",1332201600,4,565,4.384615384615385
4460469,5,B004RCGQSC,one of the most original comedies out. lots of laughs and tons of replay value. would recommend it to any friend. true genius.,1332028800,2,126,4.521739130434782
4460470,5,B004RCGQSC,one late night I was channel surfing and this delocated show appeared on the screen. I gave it about five minutes and I was laughing so hard it hurt. this is definitely a must watch show!,1331856000,4,187,4.222222222222222
4460471,5,B004RCGQSC,"I've said this for years, but no one in all of comedy makes me laugh like Jon Glaser. This show is such a perfect expression of his humor. I love it dearly.",1331424000,2,156,3.90625
4460472,5,B004RCGQSC,"This show makes me laugh louder than any show on TV. I recommend it to anyone, and everyone I let borrow these DVD's ends up buying it. The jokes are layered enough that you could watch an episode over and over.",1331251200,4,211,4.170731707317073
4460473,5,B004RCGQSC,"This TV show is hilarious for anyone that likes alterntive humor such as ATHF, Ventur Bros, Ugly Americans and the like. It's random, ridiculous, and highly entertaining.

Don't buy this for anything other than to make you and your friends pee from laughter.

If you're unsure if this style of humor is for you, consider this question: how do you stop the Russian Mafia from shooting you?

Simple. Wear a vest full of puppies.

If you're confused, this isn't for you. If you caught yourself smirking, you'll probably enjoy this show.",1329177600,4,533,4.824175824175824
4460474,5,B004RCGQSC,"This is one of the funniest shows I've ever seen. It's a shame barely anyone knows about it. The show is a fake reality show about Jon who is in the witness protection program. Everything that comes out of Jon's mouth is gold and the voice disguiser makes it even funnier. The show also follows the Russian mob who is trying to kill Jon. Besides being absolutely hysterical with tons of great one-liners and surreal dark humor, the show is also a biting satire on the world of reality television. Like a lot of Adult Swim's programming, the comedy is done in a very improvisational and deadpan style. Give this show a chance. Don't just watch one episode and give up, the show will grow on you the more you watch it. This show will go down as a cult classic and will hopefully be more recognized in the future.",1327708800,10,810,4.406666666666666
4460475,5,B004RCGQSC,"This show is not for everyone. It is a live action show from Adult Swim that hits it out of the park each episode. I was hooked from the promos, before the show even aired. I suggest checking out clips on Youtube* or AdultSwim.com before you get this. if you laugh, consider it. If you don't, just stick to Nickleback or Big Bang Theory or any other countless unfunny things.

4460477,5,B004RCGQSC,Only so often in one's lifetime does a show come along and redefine the television comedy. That show is Delocated. It is an absolute masterpiece.,1326067200,10,145,4.84

Season 1: B
Season 2: A
Season 3: D

And the Series Finale was kinda lame.  But right here on two DVDs you have some classic PFFR for ten bucks, no brainer as with all their DVDs.",1507766400,,295,3.8833333333333333

8438957,5,B004RCGQSC,Amazing show! Amazing Price! Great way to start of the new year. There is a slit over the barcode on the back even though it's new. I think this there so you can't return it to a store at a higher price. They used to do that with clearance CDs in the budget bin. Don't worry about it. This show is a masterpiece!,1483660800,,312,3.9682539682539684
