8707645,5,B00UNNVJ5E,"Wonderful! Just as I remember. My bus tape is stretched to the max. It is much more meaningful for me to pray with others. Housebound and with poor sight, the DVD is just what I needed.
Delivery was swift. Condition excellent. Priced reasonably. Thank you.",1524355200,,256,4.711111111111111
8707646,5,B00UNNVJ5E,"I bought this for my elderly mother. We used to watch this on EWTN when I was a little girl in the late 80's / early 90's. I no longer practice Catholicism, but have very warm memories of these beautiful prayers being recited by the memorable young girl in this video, and the people joining in. The peace, serenity, and innocence of this Holy Rosary is forever etched in my soul.",1511740800,,380,4.366197183098592
8707647,5,B00UNNVJ5E,A great rendition of the Rosary. I think it was the 1st one made when EWTN first came out.,1457308800,,90,3.789473684210526
8707648,5,B00UNNVJ5E,"This is the classic Rosary recitation from the 80's/90's that appeared on EWTN with the young girl beginning each rosary before switching to the international chorus and introductions of each mystery. The set includes all four sets of mysteries which you can choose from the main menu.

The quality of the video is average, but this is also an old recording that was not in any way remastered by EWTN for this dvd. You can also stream this for free from the EWTN streaming app but the DVD is of slightly better quality.

I'd recommend this as a directional means for you to pray the rosary along with the program.",1451779200,,613,4.5636363636363635
