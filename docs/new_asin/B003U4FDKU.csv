8405621,1,B003U4FDKU,"This is another attempt by Enduring Freedom Productions to sell Bush administration post 9/11 war policies. Use of ambiguous visuals, mood-setting music, incomplete and misleading monologue are means to persuade without informing that US policy is just and well executed.  For the record I support US Afghan incursion if not the Bush administration's execution of that policy, so I am not some ideologue venting my nonsense.  There is a powerful case that should be made to develop support for our Afghan policies.  As long as Bush administration apologists continue to publish this type of pablum, that case will not be presented and the support the policy requires for success will not be realized.",1281657600,2,700,5.176991150442478
