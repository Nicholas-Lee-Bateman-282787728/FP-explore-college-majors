Brutus the Barber Beefcake right before the boating accident you can see right here in a fantastic tag match with the hulk vs Mr perfect and Lanny Poffo. Madison Square Garden was electric for this one. Red and yellow all the way,1487635200,,293,4.345454545454546

The program was hosted by the oft-forgotten Sean Mooney, and it featured a program on bloopers, including legitimate flubs and staged comical moments. While entertaining, it was not the greatest selling point of the tape.

Thankfully, the collaboration of matches was great for its time! It had matches with Hulk Hogan, Roddy Piper, Randy Savage, Bret Hart, and Demolition, as well as a profile on the Rockers.

MATCH ONE: Hacksaw Jim Duggan might not be remembered for many great matches, but this match was great. Randy Macho Man Savage had a way of bringing out the best in most people, and this match was originally broadcast on Saturday Night's Main Event. The eleement of excitement is decreased slightly with the commentary of Sean Mooney and Lord Alfred Hayes, but all of the action is still there.

MATCH TWO: The Rockers face the Powers of Pain, and the contrast of speed and strength carries the entire match. The MSG crowd loved the Rockers here, and rightly so!

MATCH THREE: Originally broadcast on Prime Time Wrestling, this match was another excellent showcase for the Rockers, a good reminder looking back of why they inspired so many stars of today. The ending loses all meaning in today's time, but the action holds up well.

MATCH FOUR: The obligatory ""Fan Favorite match"" segment, seen in numerous Coliseum Home Videos and a running-gag for today's fans. Regardless, Hercules and Akeem made for a good match and it was good to re-live the gimmick of ""The African Dream.""

MATCH FIVE: This match was very intersting since it occurred a few weeks before WrestleMania VI, and the ending is eerily similar to one of the matches at that event. Regardless, Demolition is still a favorite team of many fans and this match was another good example of why.

MATCH SIX: Two great talents, and this match was prior to Bret Hit Man Hart hitting his stride in the singles division. Most fans remember that Bret was a diamond in the rough for years, but looking back now, this match leads me to think WWFE knew his worth the whole time.

MATCH SEVEN: Rowdy Roddy Piper and Ravishing Rick Rude had a good feud develop in 1989, and this match was probably the payoff. Unfortunately it was kept exclusive to Coliseum Home Video, but if you have seen the match, chances are you remember most of it. It was truly great!

MATCH EIGHT: It was not often that Coliseum Home Video closed with the biggest match on the tape, and I have my doubts whether the producers felt they were doing it here or not. Nowadays, this match looks like a total mismatch. But the way it developed in MSG, it was a bankable contest.",1154217600,,2811,4.66060606060606
