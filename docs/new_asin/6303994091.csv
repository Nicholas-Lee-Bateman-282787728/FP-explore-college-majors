751193,5,6303994091,"When they are on location, film directors usually tend to forget the actors in order to become for a while only still photographers. If James Bond is in Paris, one can be sure to enjoy a free guided tour of the city including the Eiffel Tower, Les Champs-Elyses and l'Arc de Triomphe. So, when one reads that the story of french director Bertrand Tavernier's COUP DE TORCHON is happening in the French West Africa of 1938, wild images begin to fly through the movie lover's anxious mind : elephants, lions, snakes, Tarzan, glorious sunsets and other african clichs suddenly make their appearance in front of his very eyes.
But amateurs of touristic trips will be very disappointed with Tavernier's use of african landscapes. The director is even playing with us in the scene involving the french rock singer Eddy NONO Mitchell standing on his bed  because something is moving under his bed. We are all waiting for a snake, a scorpion or a colourful spider to burst out while the dangerous animal is finally described as a vulgar night butterfly that the director doesn't even judge necessary to show to the audience. Bertrand Tavernier is not following the usual codes of the genre and is saying it.
In fact, Bertrand Tavernier doesn't follow any codes in COUP DE TORCHON. The main character, Philippe LUCIEN CORDIER Noiret, is presented as a weak corrupted policeman despised by the local bad boys. Once he has earned a bit of our sympathy, he turns into a machiavelic no-law madman driven by revenge. The last scene of COUP DE TORCHON deserves to stay in movie history : Philippe Noiret, by the sole power of his eyes and gestures, makes us understand that he has become completely mad.
So why Africa ? For its strange atmosphere, for its heat, for its colours. Bertrand Tavernier explains it very clearly during the interview you will find as extra-feature with this Criterion release. An alternate ending, not very convincing, is also presented as well as the american trailer of this 1981 movie which, in my opinion, is a masterpiece.

751194,5,6303994091,"This is the best film adaptation of Jim Thompson to date, and a marvellous film beside that fact.  Tavernier knows the book throughout but doesn't bow to it; he builds his own movie out of the story filling it with character and nuance.  He doesn't cop out like Peckinpah, or try to be too clever - he makes a classic film that works, not because he builds on convention, but because he makes it all his own.  The actors, especially Noiret, appear to be thoroughly enjoying the filming and provide us with sly performances that don't knock you over only because they are too subtle for that.  Truly a wonderful film, startling in its bursts of violence and in its understated black humor.  Pay attention and the rewards will be many.",986169600,24,733,4.564885496183206
751195,3,6303994091,"Based on Thompson's book Pop 1280 (brilliant, short, haunting, and like no other book I've ever read), I believe this to be a very failed attempt.  But a worthy failure nontheless.  Surely worth buying or renting to satisfy one's curiosity (I believe I had to wait over 10 years to finally see it).  I think the filmmakers, if working today, would have had the guts to film the book as it was meant to be.  A friend once called the story ""Barney Fife meets Taxi Driver"", which certainly is understandable.  I would add Bester's The Stars My Destination to the list.  Sound ridiclously impossible?

Noiret is the secretly-smart sherriff who slowly goes insane from the brutality and backwardness of the life he is forced to endure.  Huppert is dang sexy as the woman who helps triggers the violence.  Brilliant film switches back and forth from dark humor to horror: it keeps you guessing and on edge.

751197,5,6303994091,"just as in Shakespeare, everybody dies, and we are very happy about it. Noiret and Eddy Mitchel are excellent, disturbing",955324800,2,121,5.1
751319,3,6303994091,"I'm paraphrasing the lines of the hero when he confesses that he has thought and reflected and pondered about his life situation and after sleepless nights and trying to wrap his mind around it, he finally decides that he just doesn't know what the f.... to do.  This is how I felt after seeing this film.  I lay awake in bed, trying to wrap my mind around it, to make some sense of it and finally decided that I couldn't, and went to sleep.

Tonight I decided to read some of the reviews of Jim Thompson's book on which this film is based, hoping to get some insight into what the film was trying to do and whether or not it succeeded.  I'm sure that if I read the novel I'd be better equipped to make a judgment but frankly the film didn't interest me enough to get the book.

From what I can draw, however, it seems to me that a very rough but smart and funny noir novel that was set in Oklahoma has been transposed into French West Africa, and not entirely successfully.  I don't think it's the fault of the locale switch, though.  To me it's the vision of the the director, Bertrand Tavernier. Is he making a hard-nose noir thriller or a charming character study?  Is he going for cold-blooded or warmth?  Part of the problem may be that it's shot very beautifully in color which gives it a lot of warmth.

My best guess is that the main mistake is in the the casting of the wonderful Phillippe Noiret as the protagonist. Noiret is a big, teddy bear of a guy whom I'd hire as a Santa Claus or invite over to baby sit my grandchildren.  He seems so inherently sweet that his ""conversion"" from meek, pushed-around, good-hearted, small town sherrif who can't bear to actually put people in jail, to cold-hearted murderer just isn't convincing.  I can imagine that, in the novel, there's no such problem and perhaps if another actor were playing the role, it would work better for me.  (I had no problem following Matt Damon down his road to destruction, in The Amazing Mr. Ripley....another film in which we get so involved in the character of the murderer that we want him to go free.)

In the first half of the film we see the sherrif (Noiret) not only being passive and a push-over, but genuinely kind.  He helps the schoolteacher remove a speck from the eye of one of her Black pupils and later, he pays for admittance to the movies for a group of her pupils.  He is kind to his Black servant, unlike the rest of the French White colonists.  The way the film shows him (I don't know how it's done in the novel), his unwillingness to punish people doesn't seem to be a matter of laziness as much as a genuine aversion to causing harm.  He seems to be a genuinely kind man and that kind of kindness comes from strengh, not weakness.

So, when he changes his tune and starts shooting people...well I have to wonder why, exactly. At first I cheered him on because his targets were genuinelly sleazy characters.  But then, when he shot the Black servant I really had to scratch my head in wonder.  Was he really a repressed rageaholic all along who was just afraid of showing it?  This may be more analysis than one wants to undertake, but in order for the film to make sense, one has to have a sense of the man's basic character.  There is so much talk at the end from the guy, trying to explain himself, that it seems that the film maker is at least trying to address the problem.  And he doesn't do a good job of it, IMHO.

Some reviewers here simply state that the guy went insane but that doesn't seem right to me, either.

In the final analysis I can only say that the film seems to have lost something in translation.  Noiret seems like someone's favorite old uncle who spends his time making wine in the south of France.  I'd like to send him back to Provence and leave the gangster films to the real bad guys. (and leave Isabel Huppert in Africa to stand trial)  I think it's the inconsistency of the vision of the director that makes the film fail to genuinely satisfy.  But it's clever, visually appealing, and watching Noiret is always a pleasure.",1236384000,3,4060,4.3675099866844205
751320,5,6303994091,"For my money, this is one of French director Bertrand Tavernier's best and most imaginative films, based on a Jim Thompson novel and filmed entirely in Senegal - transported there from the American South. A 2-hour film, shot in muted colors and to a great extent with a Steadicam, it has a look and feel that studiously avoids the exotic and any of the cliches and stereotypes that Western audiences might have about Africa. While technically a film noir in its subject matter and its focus on crime and the criminal mind, it also avoids the cinematic conventions of that genre, with its sun-drenched images and its mix of dark psychological drama and cold-blooded violence with comedy and farce. A story without a moral center, it refuses to find a neat way out of the conflicts it creates, and neither love nor the judicious use of firearms is able to bring the ambiguity at the heart of the film into resolution.

The performances in the film are striking, especially veteran Phillipe Noiret as the small town policeman who finds that he's free to disavow a code of morality that might have restrained him were he not representing the law far from France in a colonial town in the 1930s. Set morally adrift, he finds himself capable of justifying any misbehavior, whether cheating on his wife or murdering a faithful retainer. Like Tavernier's other excursions into character, time and place, this film poses a number of intriguing questions that it leaves partly unanswered. The final image of Noiret, about to commit an unspeakable act and then discovering a sudden lack of resolve, represents well the final enigma of his character. The DVD includes a long and very informative interview with Tavernier.",1186617600,2,1709,4.893103448275862
751321,3,6303994091,"This is a typical strange film from French director Bertrand Tavernier, with Isabelle Huppert as female star. It happens in French West Africa. You have the black natives and the white French, as the 2 opposite races that play a big part in the story. You have also the bad guys, vicious, racist, stupid, against the main character, to whom everything is related.

There is a transformation in this character along the film. And this transformation seems to be the ""story"" of the film. What this transformation means, how it comes to happen, what is going on exactly, I don't know. You may take a guess if you see this film. But as for me, I didn't care, because even a boring and uninteresting film I can take it, but not when it is narrated in this unoriginal and coarse way.

I have to say that I like most of the French cinema, so apparently boring and lack-of-action films don't mean bad to me. But this one is just not nice to look at. I couldn't figure out what the whole thing was about (and if it was about what I just said, then it's not worth it). I can't get to like any of the characters. I film with no hero, not even somebody to like!

This is the dramatic stage chosen by Tavernier to make an ambitious film where the predator concept will surround the screen thanks to a perfect script. Three out of this world stars of cinema such as Noiret, Audran and Huppert are overwhelming.

751323,4,6303994091,"This is an interesting adaptation of the Jim Thompson novel, POP 1280.

The book took place in the American southwest and in the film it is French Colonial Africa circa 1938 which makes for a very interesting background to the  story of the slow moral descent of a basically decent and put-upon small town Constable who one day decides to start killing  the people who annoy him; he quickly discovers that since he is the Law in those there parts, he can get away with just about anything!

This is mordantly funny and sort of alarming at the same time.

 I've always admired the acting of Philippe Noiret and here he proves to be his usual excellent self; even after he's SERIOUSLY crossed the line, morally speaking, he still seems likable, even when firing off incredibly misanthropic and nihillistic rants about evil and human nature.

This film takes the standard tropes of a revenge/vigilante melodrama and turns it into a black comic parable about the corruptability of the human soul.  It moves a bit slow at times and i could've done with much less of Noiret's unfaithful wife and lug of a boyfriend, but they get what they deserve, so i won't complain too much; i just wish it had happened sooner and a  bit faster.",1133654400,4,1225,4.6342592592592595

751325,5,6303994091,"A strangely beautiful film which works its magic on the viewer from the opening credits of first a black bird, then a sole black  African child filling the screen. I was especially taken by the cinematography itself and the use of colour. The mis en scene is almost always a dun or sand or pale brown pastel colour  but pierced by small brilliant colours found in such things as a cummerbund, or pocket kerchief, or the singlet of the protagonist or his odd red sock, a green bottle of absinthe in an outside bar, a green light shade at night, or a crimson hat band on soldiers. Added to this is the startlingly effective use of music , a collage of sounds which modify the images rather than compound or complement them providing a tone of tragi-comedy, a kind of comedy noir.  There is also a memorable nightmare sequence which the protagonist experiences.  As for themes - perhaps that of the scandalous Colonial in another's country, the stranger in a strange land, the decline of the West-

or an ageing Colonial Police Chief searching for the meaning of his life and exacting punishment on those who deserve it, on those that he is able to. The closing moments are quite memorable.

751327,5,6303994091,"Very unusual movie. I was unprepared for such a strange story. Only after the movie was over did I glimpse Jim Thompson's name in the credits and it dawned on me so that is what I have been watching. Thompson's name is synonymous with hard-boiled noir and if you like that genre then this is for you though the setting will throw even the most ardent noir fan for a bit of a loop. Noir in Africa? Phillips Noiret plays the sherrif of a West African town in the thrall of the worst kind of colonialism. Unforunately he's not much of a law and order man. In fact he is completely ineffective at administering any kind of justice whatsoever. Blacks are brutally mistreated right in front of him and he does nothing. Hes the sherrif only in name and at home he is abused by his wife played by Stephane Audran who does not hide the fact she is sleeping with her live-in ""brother"".  The sherriff takes all kinds of abuse til one day he reaches his breaking point. He decides he's had enough and so he begins administering his own brand of ""justice"". In a western movie or in a gritty American noir this kind of scenario would seem commonplace but not in the middle of sunny Africa. Noirs aren't supposed to be exposed to sunlight, are they? The novel was set in the American South but Tavernier decided he would transplant the story in African soil.  Its a film that is hard to fathom. I believe it takes at least one viewing to get used to the idea of an African Noir and then another to see just what Tavernier is up to. So I would highly recommend anyone see the film twice before making up their mind about it.  One thing is undoubtedly certain and that is the acting. The performances by Noiret, Audran, and Isabelle Huppert(one of her most stunning vacant faced roles) are perfect and the most fascinating aspect of the film is watchng each unwind.  Even those who don't normally have a taste for noir will find this very dark comedy quite compelling. On first viewing I felt there was something missing like at least one strong black character but then I realized on second viewing that that is part of the power of this comedy.  These characters are so selfish it matters very little to them where they are.  And so the abscence of black characters and the abscence of any interaction between whites and blacks except on the most superficial and degrading terms underlines the utter selfishness of the whites. The blacks going about their business largely ignored by the whites offer a subtle comparison. The blacks live humane lives. The whites are only capable of committing crimes against each other. If you are part of the white community in such circumstances you become corrupt if not for what you yourself do for what you refuse to see as the underlying injustice of the circumstance you see and participate in everyday. The circumstance is a timebomb. Noiret as the sherrif is the one who goes off. He acts out against white hate and anger and bigotry only to become infected himself by those very properties. So at first I was unsure but ultimately I marveled at what Tavernier did with this noir material. He gave the material the very dimension it lacked, a social dimension.  By placing this noir in a strikingly new context the typical noir theme (being the darkness of human nature) is given a more specific context and scope (the darkness of colonial mans nature).  Tavernier brings new life and significance to the commonplaces of Thompsons fiction and more importantly he brings a new approach and new insight to the colonial predicament.",1043366400,16,3557,4.608214849921011

Soon hes knee deep in murder and deceit, and with a philandering wife, a needy mistress and blood on his hands, there is nowhere for Lucien to go but down, down, down.

Set in the late 1930s, Coup de Torchon covers a wide range of themes, not the least of which is racism in this French African Colony.  Taking these weighty themes and expressing them with sharp and fluid strokes, director Bertrand Tavernier keeps things moving and maintains and airiness needed to make each scene snap about as much as Lucien does.  The performances here also help ground the film, especially Philippe Noiret, who reminded me a lot of Jose Garcia in Le Couperet.

Smart, provocative and detailed to the very bottom, Coup de Torchon is as whimsical as it is poignant.",1391040000,,1076,4.602094240837697
7858235,5,6303994091,"One of my favorite novels is Pop. 1280 by Jim Thompson, and the film, Coup de Torchon, based on the novel is now one of my favorite films. Ironically, having the DVD is better than going to the theater in 1981 when the film was released because the DVD includes an interview with the film's director, Bertrand Tavernier. So if you're a real film buff, or better yet, a fan of film noir, you'll find this film a small masterpiece. Unlike other film noir  typically shot in either black and white with ""those shadows"" or in saturated color a la  Quentin Tarantino, Coup de Torchon is in pastels. This color palette evokes a gentler backdrop to human violence which makes the contrast that much sharper. Even the chief of police's shirt is a washed out pink, looking something like faded red long johns. The colors of Senegal, where the film was shot on location, are muted rusts, browns and sun-baked, and that's what we see.

Pop. 1280 took place about 100 years ago in a small southern American town, but Coup de Torchon is set in 1938 in West French Africa (Senegal) in the fictional town of Bourkassa, with a population of 1275--a sly reference to Thompson's book, modestly subtracting five souls. At the center of the film is the chief of police, Lucien Cordier. He comes across as lazy, corrupt and cowardly. His wife invites her brother, Nono (a small but brilliantly played part by Eddy Mitchell) to live with them. Everyone believes that the brother is not her brother but her lover, and she indulges his every whim in front of her hapless husband. However, the chief has a lover of his own, Rose, the abused wife of the town bully, whom Cordier lets get away with the wife beatings and beating the native Senegalese. It's too much trouble to arrest him, and besides, the whole town would believe that if the chief arrested the husband of his  lover, it would be because of the affair. (An affaire de coeur is one thing, but to arrest the cuckolded husband just wouldn't do.)  He is further abused by two pimps from whom he collects bribes. They too debase him verbally and physically, but it's easier to take bribes than arrest them. Courdier seeks advice from police officials in a much larger town, and they humiliate him in describing how they would handle the pimps. He also seeks advice from a local Catholic priest, who ""blesses"" him by asking God to give him the courage to do the right thing with the town bully--the husband of his lover.

As Cordier takes control, we find that not only is he not bumbling, but he is both shrewd and ruthless. Also, he is far smarter than his tormentors who think him a dolt. Initially, the viewer may find a connection with Cordier as he weaves his way forward. He is funny, and what he does is funny in some schemes to get what he wants. Otherwise, Cordier only does what we might do by way of payback--or fantasize doing. As such we side with and understand him. However, at some point we realize that Cordier may be more (or less) than we thought or would be willing to be. On reflection, both of Thompson's and Tavernier's contrast the everyday violence with the larger violence in the world. In a memorable line, Cordier tells the new school teacher, ""Thanks to you, black children will be able to read their daddy's name on French war memorials."" It is revealing in that while colonial exploitation of the Senegalese in French West Africa in the form of the  tirailleurs sngalais, who were responsible for much of the fighting by Free French units both against the Afrika Korps in North Africa and in the Normandy campaign, were not allowed to join the march into Paris for their deserved credit in the liberation of that city--no blacks were allowed.

Perhaps even more so than Thompson in Pop. 1280, Tavernier points to and illustrates larger societal violence in the form of discrimination and dehumanization in Coup de Torchon. Neither Tavernier nor Thompson lets the audience back away from interpersonal violence and more importantly, the consequences of both interpersonal and societal violence. One lesson to come away with is that those who calmly rationalize (or even provide priestly blessings for) larger societal violence are no different than those who calmly rationalize interpersonal violence. The rationalizations are the same, but for some reason we're more accepting for wholesale violence than the more interpersonal retail sort. Stalin is quoted as saying, ""The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic."" From Coup de Torchon we see that Stalin was probably right.",1340496000,4,4569,4.738364779874214

7858239,4,6303994091,"'Coup de Torchon' is an ambiguous film.  The main character, Lucien Cordier, is the equivalent of a small town sheriff in French West Africa just prior to WWII - and as he interacts with the coarse population of this outlying community, I can't tell if he's lost his mind or is just very clever.  Throughout the film, he sets up his enemies for untimely ends, and orchestrates it so that the blame falls squarely on someone else, all while pretending (?) to be a simpleton, a buffoon.  But what makes the film cryptic is that Bertrand Tavernier as director does not massage the audience into identifying with or denying Lucien - instead he keeps the camera rolling and lets us decide for ourselves.

'Coup de Torchon' is based on 'Pop 1280', my favorite novel of Jim Thompson's, but unfortunately, I had a difficult time connecting with the movie, although I thought the adaptation was well done.  Also, transplanting from Texas to Africa had very little or no effect on the overall tone, and the actors were excellent.  The trouble that I had was that by the end, I thought the film definitively answered the question of Lucien's sanity, and I was unprepared for that.  It may have been something I missed in the novel, but Thompson hadn't seemed up for answering that question - instead he left it to the reader.

Another factor of uncertainty is that I can never be sure, with film or novel, whether the darn thing is a comedy or a tragedy - and again, in 'Coup de Torchon', no one seems willing to commit.  I've seen comedy in violent movies before, and vice versa, but the set up is usually such that the viewer is permitted to laugh because the violence is directed at someone whom we're prepped to believe deserves it.  'Torchon' isn't that easy, and although there isn't any open-endedness to its events, because of the amoral complexity some viewers may feel frustrated with the temper of the film.

This movie will not have a broad appeal, but I'd certainly recommend it to those interested in moral tangles.  Lucien, as a distilled version of humanity with all its puzzling contradictions, brings into sharp relief the utter absurdity of our collective actions.  Individually, he is repugnant - but when nations undertake the same behavior, we throw parades.  WWII looms in the immediate future of these people, and within that context, the reproach I feel for Lucien could be interpreted as fraudulent nonsense - which is another reason I felt a bit uncomfortable during the film.

Uncompromising, 'Coup de Torchon' will quite possibly offend, especially those who are not prepared to question their beliefs.  Nonetheless, it is certainly a worthwhile movie, and one that left me many things to think over.

This Criterion Edition is unrated, though it contains nudity, adult language and situations, and violence (not graphic).  Extras include an interview with Bertrand Tavernier and the trailer for the film, but no commentaries.",1255219200,,2944,4.865731462925852
