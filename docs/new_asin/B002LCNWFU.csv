8372503,2,B002LCNWFU,"This was the 1st time I ever saw this show.  I don't know what happens every week, who the target audience is, etc.  Again, this is just my uninformed two cents.

I've been watching a lot of ""Hoarders"" lately.  Like that show, this has no narrator and expects the viewer to do a lot of reading.  Unlike ""Hoarders,"" the counseling took place in a typical office environment.  It stood out to me that both subjects here were married parents.  ""Hoarders"" frequently shows individuals who are isolated from almost everyone in the world.  This people seemed connected and far more stable.

This covers 12 weeks.  Maybe that's good for showing part of the therapeutic process.  However, I think many a patient/client will need FAR more than 12 weeks to deal with their issues.  I've heard that Dr. Phil has been critiqued for his ""just get over it!"" rapacity.  This may have an element of that too.

Shannon's pain was partially caused by a previous miscarriage.  She buried the embryo in a real cemetery.  I'm glad that was healing to her.  But it seemed like a waste of space.  I think only those with a lot of money could do that.  Burial space is pricey and I doubt this was a real option for the millions of miscarried entities out there.  I don't blame Shannon for fearing highways: California is a MESS with all its highways!  That was 1 of my countless reasons not to stay there.  Thank god for all the good public transportation east of the MS River!

In ""Hoarders,"" the show concludes with the hoarder cleaning up, or coming close to it.  It was novel to see Todd fail at his therapy.  Perhaps psychological clients have to make several attempts to change just like drug addicts relapse often before ending their addictions.  I think many ""dudes"" will relate to Todd due to his manly appearance and Vin Diesel-like, low voice.  He writes on walls and if that's a big no-no for children, it seemed incredibly odd, and wasteful, for an adult to be doing.  I hope that family has enough money to repaint the entire house before they move.  Todd's OCD involved pulling out his hair.  The show never explored why he didn't pull out his eyebrows too.  Further, it never asked whether electrolysis might be a possible solution.

This does seeem like a show to watch again, at least for a few times.",1310774400,,2295,4.590123456790123
