4374407,4,B004GZZH8A,"""A sound soul dwells within a sound mind and a sound body."" If a soul becomes evil, it has the potential to turn into a demonic kishin -- which is when the meisters and their shapeshifting weapon/partners come in. ""Soul Eater Parts 1 and 2"" is a solid beginning to a well-written, deliciously Halloweeny fantasy series, with solid writing and a twisty-turny subplot that promises to get even better with time.

The meisters of the DWMA work for Lord Death to keep the world from being overrun with kishin -- they get rid of evil souls, kill monsters, battle witches, and try to collect souls so that their weapon/partners can become Death Scythes. Among their number are Maka and her scythe Soul Eater, narcissistic ninja Black Star and Tsubaki, and Death's OCD son Death the Kid and his twin pistols Patty and Liz.

But nabbing the right combination of evil souls isn't their only problem: they have to grapple with zombies, mad scientists, the legendary sword Excalibur, a vengeful werewolf, and the demon blade Masamune (who also happens to be Tsubaki's brother). Even worse, the meisters must battle the evil witch Medusa, who has infected Soul Eater with the madness-inducing black blood. Btu this little group may be the world's only hope when Medusa seals away Death and his meisters, so she can unleash the ultimate horror on the world.

""Soul Eater"" is a series that looks kind of... well, cartoonish. Think bug-eyed trees, big grinning sun and moon, cats in pointy hats, and an academy apparently built out of skulls and candles. All it needs is some vampires. Fortunately, there's substance under all the Halloween kitsch -- ""Soul Eater Parts 1 and 2"" is a solid dark fantasy story that becomes outright brilliant in its second half.

The series starts out a bit fluffy, but once the characters have been introduced, the writers spin up a good balance of action, a hint of romance, and plenty of comedy (""Why are you standing up there yelling like an idiot?"" Soul asks Black Star, who was trying to sneak up on them). And it dips into darker territory as it winds on, especially with the grotesque madness that is sneaking up on Soul.

It also has a strangely endearing cast, who are usually odd couples. There's uptight Maka and laid-back Soul, who bicker and snipe but clearly care deeply for one another; Black Star makes Naruto look sedate, but turns out to be deeper than his narcissistic rantings would suggest, and the mild-mannered Tsubaki is a sweet foil to him. Death the Kid rounds out the cast nicely -- he's violently OCD (and I mean that literally), and obsessed with symmetry in everything. Don't mention his hair.

The voice actors also deserve a shout-out -- Laura Bailey, Monica Rial, Vic Mignogna and John Swasey all do excellent jobs as their characters, and Todd Haberkorn is utterly brilliant (""I'm a pig! A louse! I deserve to die!""). And relative newbie Micah Solusod (who sounds eerily like Johnny Yong Bosch) is perfect as the titular character.

This solid, kitschy-horror series starts off a bit frothy, but soon achieves a brilliant balance of light and darkness. ""Soul Eater Parts 1 and 2"" is a solid first half to an enjoyable series.",1296518400,23,3176,4.795246800731261

4374416,5,B004GZZH8A,"I admit, the artstyle of the show DID put me off for watching it for a while. I just felt the show seemed to be more like a cartoon than an acual anime.

I was wrong, even though I still think the artstyle is a bit cartoonish like whats up with that moon  that smiles and has blood dripping down it's mouth? Why does it even have a mouth. Even death looks like something from cartoon network.

In any case though this is a very well made anime. I won't bother giving a full review for this series, I don't have time for that. It's a very typical shonen anime were the protagonists of the series gradually get stronger and stronger as more episodes go by. Some typical anime fan service here and there, nothing too raunchy though. Jokes can be genuinely funny and give the anime a sense of personality. If there is one thing this anime has going for it it's defently it's style. The blu ray makes it look so good. All its openings, mid intermissions, and ending openings show this as well as how the anime handles it's story. You know one episode they are trying to find the holy sword of Excalibur and the next they are on a field trip for extra credit class. It's pretty diverse and keeps all the episodes feeling fresh and intresting. No filter episodes here, this is all from the manga from start to finish. Fight scenes are particularly well done, very fluid and can bring the intensity level dispite my criticisms of the art style.

Overall I really ended up enjoying this anime. Not my favorite anime but no less enjoyable as my favorite animes.",1514678400,,1551,4.393728222996516

4374457,5,B004GZZH8A,"Soul Eater is already a good anime- funny, dark, and knowing exactly when to be serious or silly- and this is a good version of it. Even the non-Blueray DVD's fairly high quality, from what I can tell, equivalent to or better than streaming it online. But the real clincher is the price- many full series go for around a hundred dollars, making thirty dollars a steal. Every episode is included, as are little bonus content on most disks- the opening/ending songs without lyrics on them, some episode commentaries, and these little 'late night' shorts. And maybe this is standard, but it included both the Japanese and English vocal tracks, so you can listen to whichever you prefer. Not a whole lot of bells and whistles, but it's pretty solid.

Overall, I'd say this is a good buy if you just want to own the series outright and not have to stream it, or worry about it not being available due to rights issues.",1485820800,4,913,4.567073170731708

4374470,5,B004GZZH8A,"Man this series is great, it has the right amount of action, drama, humor, and darkness. The characters are unique both weapons and meister, the DWMA looks like a fun place to be. The designs of death city are unique. It is weird that the sun and moon have faces though but I got over it. This series does feel incomplete, it needs a sequel or some spin-offs. I'm not gonna spoil anything but there are 3 villains in this series and only the witch medusa was really evil good, the other two didn't cause enough pain like medusa did. The ending felt rushed and I know maka is ""Brave"" but no i don't buy the way she won at the end. I wish they could've add more to the story like, lord death's youth years, the origins of the DWMA, the elder witch, which weapon becomes a death scythe or the appearance of maka's mom. There are a lot of unanswered questions, but besides that I loved it. I hope they make a season 2 or something. I highly recommend it to any anime fan or newbies like yours truly.",1479686400,,995,4.214659685863874

The action and humor are both on point, you also really become to like the characters because of the good character development. The first couple of episodes I was already hooked. Soul Eater is a stereotypical shonen anime though. Also, be prepared to struggle a little to take the blu ray discs out, they are in there tight. You can go ahead and look at the art work without spoiling anything for yourself, it is spoiler free.

The last thing that kind of turns me off, the anime made too many changes compared to the manga. I am all good for changes just as long as it makes it better than the original material or it is just a lateral change.

Not terribly deep in the story as of now but am in love with this show, definitely one of my favorite anime series out there. The animation/art style at first is strange, but after the first episode or two I fell in love with it. I actually prefer English dubs over the original Japanese, and this show's dub is pretty funny in my opinion. The writing and is entertaining and the dialogue is well-timed. The DVD set itself is what I expected and am absolutely excited to have discovered Soul Eater; by the way Death the Kid is freaking hilarious!",1414886400,,672,4.42741935483871

4374630,5,B004GZZH8A,"This is my tv.com review

This is a great anime. Like so many, it has cool abilities, likable characters, blends comedy and action very well and was fun to watch. The animation has a gothic like feel to it, though I do wonder why the moon and sun look scary.

This is also one of the few times I've ever seen the Grim Reaper in a more benevolent light. He is funny, humorous and was only dark when he had to face his son Asura.

The show's main themes are friendship, forming bonds, and courage. The friendship between the characters makes them very formidable and Meisters and their Weapons show a strong bond to make them great fighters, and it took courage to face the Kishin, with a punch full of courage destroying him.",1412467200,,724,4.388059701492537
4374631,5,B004GZZH8A,"I'm not going to take much time to review the SERIES, as I like to collect physical copies only after i've watched the series and know I like it. So I couldn't possibility find anything disappointing or unexpected there. As the other reviews show, this is a high-energy animation with plenty of awesome characters, extremely slick art direction, and a great presentation of a plot you've probably seen before, but was never quite this fun.

What is great about this release is that it is CHEAP for an entire anime series. While Soul Eater has been around and is easy to find (it's on Netflix right now) the Blu-Ray is the highest quality version you can get. It doesn't have many extras at all, but it's the best way to watch the series if you want to splurge a bit on anime! I tested the first disk on my PS3 and it worked beautifully. The original Japanese dub (with subtitles of course) is there as well as the dub, for those of you who are concerned! And the packing is pretty nice too; sure it's not a limited edition or anything fancy, but it's the entire series in HD for a very, very good price.

I'll add one tiny warning: There was a bit of damage to the paper sleeve; in the corners. You know how they get if they get shuffled around for years in storage. I don't mind because my cases always suffer this kind of damage when i haul them around for moving or to friends houses; i'm not really a collector and the video/audio quality of the discs is what matters the most. But if you are really picky about that kind of thing, you might want to proceed carefully.",1412380800,14,1572,4.343537414965986

I wanted to get the DVDs so I could introduce my boyfriend to this fun, dark, and nicely-animated series. The art style in Soul Eater is fairly unique among anime, which I enjoy. I already had season one so I was either going to buy this set or season two, and this set turned out to be cheaper than the season 2 set. No complaints except the art on the individual season's discs is a little more interesting than what comes on this set's discs. The disc art for the complete series is fairly plain, a simple color with the soul eater logo etched in. Doesn't really matter, though, and it still looks nice. The set also doesn't come with any paper inserts, but neither did season one. I miss the days when DVDs included paper inserts in their cases. I'm not sure why, I just do. ANYWAY, that has nothing to do with this product, so I digress. Top notch product, nice cover art, sturdy case and a cool cardboard dust cover to keep the whole thing in tip top shape.

It is nice to have a few of my most favorite episodes to watch when ever I want. The quality of the videos is, in my opinion, excellent! Especially the episodes that are available in HD.

The Series itself is nicely done, and follows a number of students in the DWMA (Death Weapon Meister Academy) as they learn to work with their partners and protect the world from evil.",1403481600,,640,4.461538461538462

4374669,5,B004GZZH8A,"Here we go
Soul Eater.
A wonderful series indeed, sadly it only lived for one season but a damn good season at that.
All fifty one episodes are masterpieces in and of themselves, with some pretty good lines to keep the characters fresh and not at all boring.
There's one episode where two of our main characters, Soul Eater Evans and Black Star -an egomaniac with a serious dorky haircut- go on an adventure to discover the sword 'Excalibur.' I won't give too much away but the payoff is pretty friggin' hysterical and I was laughing so hard I started crying.
There's a follow up series called Soul Eater Not! Which is also worth checking out
Among my favorite characters? Soul himself.
He's laid back but not too lazy, he's a charmer in some aspects and he has one crazy appetite for the blackened Kishin eggs within those who are evil.
-The series also answers questions I asked myself a lot during early episodes like ""what would a Kishin egg taste like?""
You really need a good laugh and want to turn to an anime to cure that?
Soul Eater is for you. :D",1403136000,2,1056,4.448453608247423
4374670,5,B004GZZH8A,"Bought this on my Canadian account I think, but anyways, this is the first 30+ episode series I really appreciate. I won't fully review the series itself, but I'll say each episode has a point and there's arguably no filler...coming from someone who's patience has gotten smaller and smaller with anime (sadly). Another thing I enjoy is the varied cast. I believe one of the common staples of a GOOD anime show is a cast with supporting characters just as (if not more) interesting than the main characters -- and this show has it for sure. While it's certainly inevitable to not be episodic at some points (which is fine honestly), many episodes and arcs (arcing storylines) can be viewed completely on their own, which I love.

While not a spoiler, I'll say I hated the ending at first, but after watching it twice afterwards, I finally began to understand and as cliche as it sounds, I've kind of experienced the same thing In real life & I can relate.

The Blu ray case it comes in is wonderful. A solid case not too flimsy with the same dimensions as a normal Blu ray case. However it still manages to feel ""thick"" and I really like that. Does t really have any booklets or paper inserts but I'd rather that than ridiculous separated volumes, forcing you to pay more. The paper sleeve it comes In is a tad delicate but as long as you don't toss it around it'll be fine.

As far as the show is concerned, I found the characters to be hysterical and goofy for a lot of it while also portraying their completely serious and driven sides at times, especially when in battle.  This completely bi-polar aspect of the characters personalities is pretty much mirrored in the drastic differences in animation and artistic styles which are great portrayals of the differences in the mood being represented depending on character interactions and settings.  Overall, I loved the series and I hope they will decide to create a continuation series based on the rest of the manga being released.  If all anime shows were made available in single blu-ray box sets like this one, it would make buying entire anime series much easier and less expensive.",1392854400,,1066,4.905555555555556

The main three plots revolve around the meisters Maka (A+ student), Black Star (Largest Ego that rivals Naruto when he was a kid), and Death the Kid (Symmetry, either he loves whoever has symmetry or will want to cry/kill whoever is not symmetrical.) Along with the Weapons they are partnered with. If your expecting this anime to be parallel to the manga then you'll be sadly disappointed as the series diverges around episode 35ish. I recommended the anime and manga of this franchise!",1392163200,,881,4.5125

I saw Soul Eater on Toonami and was so impressed with the series decided to buy it here on Amazon.com. The series is very entertaining. The animation (Studio BONES I love you!) is fluid and has really original character designs. The whole series though is built up even better thanks to the English voice cast making their relationships easy to get wrapped up in. I love Micah Solusod's performance as Soul and Laura Bailey's as Maka, Todd Haberkorn as Death the Kid, and Chuck Huber as Stein.",1390694400,2,557,4.683673469387755

This packages the entire 51 episode series onto 6 Blu-ray discs, includes English and Japanese languages, and the Japanese-only shorts that aired only in Japan.",1390089600,,332,5.509803921568627
4374714,4,B004GZZH8A,"This rererelease combines the Meister and Weapon Collections into one package.  One case, 8 discs, 51 episodes, and all of the special features present on those two collections.

Setting the quality of the actual anime aside, let's look at the medium.

The discs, aside from their cover images, are carbon copy clones of the original Weapon and Meister collections; once you pop the disc in, you won't know the difference.  In that respect, you're golden.

However, the Complete Series case is an issue.  The DVD insert is fine, the front successfully reflects the punk graffiti art style, albeit more subtely than on the Weapon and Meister inserts, and features the two biggest main characters Maka, and Soul, along with the two most popular side characters, Blair and Excalibur.  The back features a simple black background and an entire rollcall of the main protagonists.  This does a good job of presenting the anime as ""party in the front, drama in the back"" since in reality the show is outwardly slapstick comedy and excess, but ultimately a character drama, and is thus how the show typically pulls viewers in.

Everything other than the insert is an issue.  The case wrap is warped which looks and feels terrible, and the paper sleeve the whole case comes in is damaged.  These things could be overlooked considering that paper case sleeves are generally disposable anyway and not every case mighth necessarily arrived warped, however the case is EXPLICITLY designed poorly.  The 8 discs sit on either side of 4 separate trays in the case, and these trays are hooked onto a beam which in turn is hooked onto the case.  This beam comes out VERY EASILY which means you can pull the the entirety of the trays with little effort.  If you were to drop the case, all of the trays could fall out and even worse, one of the clasps that holds the beam could break, and none of the discs would ever go back into the case again.  This could even feasibly result from normal wear.

Consequently, I recommend purchasing a replacement 8-disc case immediately, assuming you can find one that would fit the insert.",1389830400,5,2107,4.779005524861878

Soul Eater is not like that. It hints that there is something more, but they are not slap you in the face obvious. This story is complete, where it ends, it ends. There is question left unanswered and if feel the need to go check out the books then by all means you can. If you don't then there is no feeling of obligation to do so. The story in the show is pretty darn awesome, the artwork is eerie, and the fights are more like fights, like a very toned down version of Dragonball Z, except there is no spending a whole episode charging a single attack. At the end, you'll be sad that it's over, except that you'll own it, so it won't be over...sort of.

As for the series, I don't have much to input. It's either your thing or not, I suggestion swinging by funimation's site or their youtube, at one point they had the first four dubbed episodes for free and they still might. I'm a huge fan and have watched it a couple of times in entirety already. That being said, when I saw the price drop I had to snag my own copy! I'm new to blu-ray (just upgraded) but in my opinion it's definitely worth going for the blu-ray, especially at this moment when you'd pay the same price for either version.
The set isn't lavish, but it's high quality and perfect for someone that is just looking to have the series in their collection (like me). The case is really nice, space saving, and the case art is beautiful. Funimation has definitely sold me. <3 Off to snag more blu-ray anime.!!",1387843200,,1002,4.48087431693989

This show is just so much fun to watch! I remember when I first watched it. I was watching an AMV (those videos on YouTube where people take clips from various animes and put them together along with some good music.) The art really interested me, for I've never seen anything like it before, found out it was on Netflix, and just... Watched it.
This show is everything all in one! It's funny, it can be sad, it can be really violent (surprisingly very violent for a show rated 14+ but that's what's fun about it! Blood, blood and more BLOOD!), and it can be very creepy and scary at some points (mind you, it has that Halloween theme, with creepy clowns, zombies, witches.... There was even this one episode that I watched where I couldn't sleep at night!) I even got my friend really into it.

This collection is priced in a way that it won't hurt your wallet much, and is really a great deal for the price. Not only is it blu-ray, which normally costs a LOT more than DVD, but this is what it says--the complete series. All 51 episodes are here. And it even has a small amount of extras--more than most boxed sets have. The packaging is even pretty good--the case is sturdy, and it comes in a paper slip case, too.
I completely recommend this collection to anyone who is even remotely interested in Soul Eater. It's totally worth the price.",1375833600,3,724,4.291970802919708

4374784,4,B004GZZH8A,"one time i gave soul eater a watch. i liked it and  got around 14 episodes in and simply moved on as i didn't feel like continuing. then the show came to toonami(CN/adult swims great anime block! if you like anime check it out saturdays at midnight on CN! support it!) and to some extent i regained interest. then like most anime i went on amazon to see the dvd/bd releases and consider collecting the anime. i found this amazing complete series set for $30! when it arrived the next 3 days of my life were spent solely watching the rest of the series(eps 15-51). but please know this set is for those who wants all the episodes and don't care for too many special features. also the packaging is barebones compared to funimations regular releases. the 6 discs are just one solid color(theyre numbered of course). theres only a slip cover and a plain clear case with an insert that has the exact same thing as the slip cover but with a cool picture of the main characters on the inside.i do understand this is a rerelease that is made cheaply and is affordable. im glad this is an option but i wish funi would do cheaper rereleases that combine multiple releases closer to after all or some ""parts"" sets are released(while one piece's collection sets are great the season 4 sets burn your wallet. but then again they are high quality sets!). as for soul eater itself its pretty awsome! as i said i marathoned it which means its probably good. the fact that your reading this means you already know the characters and stuff so i will keep this short. the first half is great. however like bones' series fullmetal alchemist the series departs from the source material partway through(most likely because chapters of the still running manga are released monthly not weekly unlike most shonen manga). while the last half is still good the ending is trash(its just so bad. its generic and cheesy and youve seen it before without knowing it) and there are times when its hard to feel and understand the characters and their actions(Small spoiler you have been warned-run maka run!).the english dub is great and has all the talented voice actors youd expect from funimation! the animation is done  by bones and that alone means the animation is great(besides 1 character thats terrible drawn in a few scenes toward the end. trust me you will learn who he is). all in all i reccomend this for those who don't own any prior releases and simply want to watch the entire series(especially in english dub since toonami isn't even past the first half). if you already own the parts or weapon and meister collections you can pass!",1373760000,2,2616,4.623655913978495

This series should be a lot more popular than it is in the anime community. Keishan's *spelling*, evil souls exist in the world and the meister academy, created by Death, is the only thing that can stop them. You have about 5 or 6 main characters in this series and you learn to love and hate all of them. Maka and Soul are technically the main characters of the story, but as a whole in the series you will find other characters to be favorites.

4374808,5,B004GZZH8A,"Any Anime Fan should Watch and have this show in their Anime collection.

Soul Eater is an Anime that's unique, funny, and amazing. The Story follows students at the Death Weapon Meister Academy. Each team has Students who are and turn into Weapons and Meister's who use the weapons. All students work to turn their weapons into Death Scythes, and become one of Lord Death's personal Weapons, but also to Defend the world from Evil and the raise of the Evil Kisan.

You follow 3 Teams of Students. Maka, perfect student and scythe meister, and her all times cool weapon Soul; Black Star, talkative egoistic assassin, and his gentle natured ninja weapon Tsubaki; and Death the Kid, symmetry obsessed grimm reaper, and his street smart  twin pistols Lisa and Patty.

Thru the series these students will have to fight evil while handeling Teachers tuning into Zombies and Professor's trying to cut them up for Study, weapon duels, black blooded mad swordsman (or Woman?), and school nurse's that are a real Witch. You know, typical school stuff.

Animation wise this show is great, the style very gothic and crazy, Sun and Moon Laughing in the sky kind of crazy. The Characters are all beautifully designed to fit their Characteristics and Craziness. I don't like to give away story plots but the each Team has their one story and the main story and they all join back together in the  end to fight the main badie.

Really the only way the see the coolness of the story is to watch this Anime. It has Amazing Characters, both good and bad, with wonderful voice acting in english, which is rare in Anime. The music is good and memorable, and the Animation is unique and above par for it's time. In the end all I have to say about this Anime is that you Should....

4374846,5,B004GZZH8A,"First of all, despite giving the show a five star rating, I'm not going to say Soul Eater doesn't have its share of problems. (The ending is pretty much a joke, as multiple reviewers have stated.) And the series is certainly not for everyone. But where it's good, it really excels. This is an anime that I imagine different people linking for different things or disliking for the same qualities that some people are really drawn to. Though the first few episodes were fun, I wasn't completely sold on the show until around episode 7. By this time, the main characters have been introduced and things take a more dramatic turn than the previous episodes.

The mixture of cartoony and silly, dark and surreal can be jarring for some, but I found this to be a big part of what I personally loved about the show. For the most part, the balancing act of these different elements was handled quite well.  The silly moments often acted as a breather for some of the darkest moments. This series could really have you laughing one scene and really break your heart in the next.

Sometimes, the writing could seem a bit weak. Sometimes, concepts were brought up and ignored or explained and never really explored later in the series. Occasionally,  I feel this is  even to the story's advantage. Episode one, for example introduced the two main protagonists and the concept of hunting down 99 corrupted human souls and 1 Witch Soul in order to turn a weapon into a death scythe. This seemed to set the series up to be a ""collect 'em all"" formula which I personally find to be boring and I'm glad the series didn't go in that direction. In fact I often found myself questioning what would happen next in many points throughout the series.

I won't call it ""a masterpiece"" or ""BEST ANIME EVER"", but I found Soul Eater to be very entertaining shonen series. When this anime succeeds, it's a captivating ride that really left me wanting more, but not in a bad way. For the differences between the anime and manga, this is one series I could imagine a FMA Brotherhood styled remake since the manga is still ongoing.

The animation is a really fun ride, and it especially shines in the battle scenes. And everything especially seems to shine on Blu-Ray. As a matter of value, this 51 episode series would be a fantastic price on DVD for under $30, but on Blu-Ray, it is a must buy for fans of the series.",1368921600,,2390,4.544186046511628

4374855,5,B004GZZH8A,"While I wasn't a fan of how they diverted from the source material 3/4 of the way through the series, this is still most definitely worth it. I mean the quality is great on Blu-ray and you are getting the entire series. We're talking about 50+ episodes of great fun and enjoyment.

The extras aren't anything crazy. They have the little shorts that aired with the original episodes now separated into their own section. A couple episodes have cast members commenting. Pretty much the usual for these kinds of things.

For the price I say it's completely worth it. You get the whole series in one package and hours upon hours enjoyment.",1367971200,,635,4.660714285714286

4374859,5,B004GZZH8A,"This is one of the Anime standards everyone should watch. The Action and Animation is great, the story was great (minus the last episode, trust me; everyone hates the last episode), and the characters are super memorable. Every episode will have on the floor laughing or on the edge of your seat in excitement. With how cheap it is now, there is no excuse why you wouldn't buy it. I hope this helps your decision.",1367798400,,413,4.52
4374860,5,B004GZZH8A,"I really like being able to sit down and zip through one episode after another; after streaming a handful of the episodes of this anime online, I immediately purchased the whole series and eagerly awaited its arrival in the mail!

The world is threatened by evil humans who consume human souls and the twisted creatures created from such consumption, Kishin. Lord Death himself founded the D.W.M.A (Death Weapon Meister Academy) in Death City to train young meisters (fighters) and their weapon partners (humans capable of transforming into a specific weapon) to hunt down and destroy Kishin before they cause too much destruction. The first three episodes introduce the three main meister/weapon pairs; Maka Albarn and her scythe Soul Eater Evans, Black Star and Tsubaki Nakatsukasa (who comes from a special family in which every member is a weapon; she herself can take several weapon forms), and Lord Death's own son Death the Kid and his twin pistols Patty and Liz Thompson.

The storyline starts off with every student's dream and goal; to turn their weapon into a legendary Death Scythe, a weapon capable of being wielded by Lord Death himself. Maka has big shoes to fill, because her mother turned her father into Lord Death's current Death Scythe, who is a true scythe at that.

Sounding too serious? Not even! While a lot of darker aspects such as who determines right versus wrong and the madness of the human mind are handled, every episode contains comic relief in one way or another. Ten minutes or so into the very first episode we get to meet Maka's rather promiscuous father (who flirts with just about every female in the series), and soon afterwards Soul accidentally dives headfirst into a bath with the busty, bubbly Blair. There is a bit of fan service sprinkled here and there as well, all tasteful and relating to the situation. I like that even in the darker episodes that keep you on the edge of your seat, there's always something sweet that comes along to make you laugh, weather it's Black Star's gigantic ego or Kid's OCD.

The plot, much to the chagrin of fans of the manga (I have yet to start reading, so I don't know too much) eventually abandons the idea of Death Scythes early in and instead focuses on the hunt for the witch Arachne (interesting bit, every witch in the series has an animal theme) and the deadly and just about all powerful Kishin, Asura. The manga is still ongoing, so a lot of people seem to be disappointed with the ending of the anime. I didn't think it was too awful myself, but I would like the rumors of a reboot the likes of FMA:B being in the works to be true! There are some bits I have heard about that are in the manga (the further exploration of becoming a Death Scythe, the battle on the Moon, Kid's Lines of Sanzu, etc.) that I would like to have learned more about or actually gotten to have seen. I'll just have to keep my hopes up!

And for any of you out there worrying about the voice acting, you can keep your fears at bay! Everybody's voice fits their character perfectly. There is also no worry about ""Westernizing"" anything in the series, as Death City is actually in Nevada and most of the characters are actually American. As for the quality of the Blu-Ray itself, it's absolutely fantastic! Apparently a lot of these recent ""Complete Series"" anime collections coming out aren't all the best quality-wise, but Soul Eater looks absolutely fantastic on my TV.

The only problem, literally the only problem, I have with this set is that rather than standard anime subtitles, which are yellow so they stand out on the animated background, these are white, and also very small, thusly making them hard to read when I want to hear the Japanese audio.

Trust me, if the first three episodes draw you in, don't even bother trying to watch more before deciding, go right out and buy this!",1367798400,2,3859,4.666176470588235

Soul Eater Review;

This is an unbiased and honest review/opinion of Soul Eater (Anime). The story was great; amusing and thrilling! A very few parts were a bit dragging and boring, but the story was still amazing, with many funny and awesome parts!!! The visual arts were very nice, very pleasing to the eyes and most of all, the arts of Soul Eater's surroundings and architechtual designs were amazing!!! Especially the sun and the moon! The characters were solid and stable; great development of the characters' personalities!!! Overall, Soul Eater is an amazing Anime to watch, one of my favourites, it is very reccomendable and commendable Anime; it deserves 4.8/5; estimate 5 stars from me.",1365120000,,1026,4.994152046783626

Ok let go, a greeky martial art girl team up with a snarky ""cool"" guy that can turn into a scyth+ naruto and and a girl who can turn into any ninja weapon+ a anti social son of a death god with two delinquent sister who can turn into gun trying to save the world? yea guy, that the best i got.
anyways this show is extremely good and fun to watch, the only flaw it have is that it skip a few chapter from the manga, plus the ending is noncanon and really bad in my opinion, if you want to know how everything really turn out......spoiler.........spoiler.......when medusa make a deal with death city is when u should stop and start reading the manga from there.",1363392000,,993,4.415300546448087
4374888,5,B004GZZH8A,"Okay, so I'll admit there is probably nothing anyone can say that would ever lead me to believe Soul Eater isn't the best thing since sliced bread, but I'll also admit that it's just my opinion and not a standing point for a legitimate argument either. Much as the same as my preference of watching a special effects loaded blockbuster over a well acted snore drama. With that said, if you are a fan, this set is a no brainer and you know that. If you're new, it is a perfect series to get your feet wet if your dipping into the anime world for first time or your trying to find a good series to start an appreciation of the art in somewhat younger ones. This and FMA are my all time faves and yes, I have seen TONs of anime. I really like some and some, the story bores the crap out of me. Some have amazing art, some not so much, some just should have stayed manga. This story follows pretty close to the manga (which I also follow) up to  about 3/4 of the series, then flys in it's own direction. I like some of the changes, not necessarily all, but love it just the same. I do hope for a Brotherhood type reboot once the manga reaches its conclusion, but then again, the manga is out there as the story progresses.",1363305600,2,1218,4.161016949152542

4374909,5,B004GZZH8A,"Soul eater had a cornucopia variety of brilliance from the abstract type of art the psychotic looking sun an moon is a good example it evokes you into the not ordinary world of soul hunting, to the comical personalitys to all the characters even the villains are humorous an they all each have there own quirky thing going death the kids OCD to Un symmetry, excaliburs 1,000 provisions ""fools!, black stars ego of surpassing god an etc. it's a great mesh of colorfull characters that makes the anime enjoyable with each 51 episodes. It is a anime for teens an up there's no extreme violence of limbs being chopped off or blood gushing out, there's moderate blood an violence an partial nudity nothing that would make it a M rating.

The setting is in the DWMA (Death Weapon Meister Academy) that was founded by lord death supposedly in ""death city"" Nevada fictional version were students are Meisters that control humans that can transform into weapons that they can wield. There objective an goals were as partners for the weapons to collect 99 souls an one 1 witch soul so there weapons can transform into a deathsyche,to uphold peace from Evil humans that feed on innocent souls an witches. Theres also a an entity called the Kishin as the story progresses .
Soul an maka are the main protagonist characters but there are many characters they come across that they have to colobrate with as a group to help them understand themselves an grow like the relationship between Crona An maka which slowly becomes very important an heart warming In the story .

In conclusion It's a fun intriguing anime although it diverts it's main story of collecting 99 souls it introduces you to a bold an interesting world for all anime fans to enjoy. Some people are not entirely happy about the ending but It does continue in the manga",1361318400,,1822,4.690625

But this review isn't about the show itself. It's about the prices. FUNimation so far has released three versions of this series. The first releases were in four parts (Part 1-3 contains 13 episodes and Part 4 contains the remaining 12 episodes),the second release were in two parts, Meister & Weapon (The Meister Collection contained the first 26 episodes and The Weapon Collection contained the remaining 25 episodes), and this release is the Complete series with all 51 episodes. I find it strange that the DVD version of this is $44.99 yet the Blu-Ray version (which is superior to DVD) only cost $20.99! That's an insane price for a complete series box set with all the episodes in BLU-RAY! This is cheaper than any Soul Eater release you will find on Amazon.",1356480000,87,903,4.75796178343949

4374981,5,B004GZZH8A,"Soul Eater is quite possibly one of the most enjoyable action anime of the past five years, at least in my opinion. From the animation and creative settings, to its wide yet unique cast of characters and (In this set particularly) the value for the length of the series, it's a must-watch. One of the keys to the show is how the characters are structured and work off each other with contrasting yet complimentary personalities (Hard-working Maka with cool, laid back Soul, energetic braggart Black Star with patient, kind Tsubaki, and OCD-obsessed Death the Kid with the fraternal twins Liz and Patty), a true ensemble cast, unlike how the back of the package blurb only focused on Maka and Soul. Stories vary from focusing on one team at a time, as each group gets a full episode to introduce themselves, to big group team-ups, to even mixing and matching characters from the different teams with seriously fun results. Visuals can range from eye-catching and colorful, to dark and moody, to over-the-top and surreal making each episode a treat. Also the sun and moon have faces and laugh and sometimes drool out blood. That's awesome. Finally, the sheer value in this package is definitely worth mentioning. The series is 51 episodes long, a robust length for an action series in this day and age, and considering how segmented previous releases of this series were, getting the entire thing for less than a dollar per episode is more than worth it.

In closing, if you've got an action itch to scratch and want a show with some staying power, Soul Eater is well worth your time and money.",1353283200,2,1592,4.768115942028985
4374982,5,B004GZZH8A,What a awesome series. If your new to the anime world i highly suggest this. For you fans if anime this has a great story and nice character chemistry. Very good series,1352764800,,168,4.28125
4374983,5,B004GZZH8A,"This series delighted me in ways no previous anime had. This was my third, after Axis Powers Hetalia, which I aborted because of abuse of cursing and crude jokes, and Black Butler, which while entertaining for its mysteries had a bit more Ho Yay than I really cared for. As in, WAY more gay jokes than I really wanted in a murder mystery series. I preferred the manga, which was far better, cleaner, and more about the actual plot than fanservice.

There is something you should know before watching this- you can't take it seriously. Half the description I look at say that this is a horror anime- IT IS NOT. It is not it is not it is not. You may not want to watch it with younger children if you don't want them to see the violence that saturates every episode, but I assure you that this is an action comedy.

It follows the life of Maka Albarn, a teenage girl in an alternate Earth where four species make up the population- humans, meisters, humans weapons, and witches. Humans are like us, human weapons are people who turn into weapons, and meisters are people who can use those weapons. Generally, they hunt witches, the last species. Maka is a meister, and is the smallest, scrawniest member of her class at the DWMA, a school for meisters and weapons run by the Grim Reaper himself. Her weapon is a lazy, sarcastic scythe who calls himself Soul Eater. By contrast, Maka is a workaholic who does really nothing but read and fight monsters, and just about everyone thinks she works too hard. While other meisters have abilities like electrocuting people and shooting fire from their hands, Maka is able to tell someone's personality by looking at them. At first, this seems pretty useless, until the actual plot shows up.

The series creator has an odd liking for screwing with the audience. The example that gets the most attention is a glaringly obvious love interest between Soul(Eater) and Maka that just goes on and on with neither even mentioning any possible attraction for most of the series. He sets up everything to seem extremely predictable, and then just goes in the opposite direction. It leaves fans confused, but surprises laughs at every turn. The series itself is hilarious. Just about everyone Maka and Soul go to school with are either complete idiots or complete psychopaths- and it's played for laughs. As each weapon used in the series is actually a person in disguise, we get to meet the legendary sword Excalibur- not exactly what anyone was expecting. One of the more beloved episodes deals with a mixup involving a gift to Maka from her father, intended to be a book, but going completely wrong.  You should know, however, that the sense of humor does not appeal to everyone. This series is very, very polarizing, and everyone I have met that has seen it either loves it or hates it.

Here are the main elements you should know about-

Parody- every anime stereotype and series imaginable is made fun of here- catgirls, the fact that one meister/weapon team is quite obviously based off of Naruto and Hinata, and that you can literally pick out lines said by Maka that first came from Edward Elric, protagonist of Fullmetal Alchemist. Most of it is played for laughs.
Violence- the show is 90% fight scenes, 10% plot. However, it is known to have some of the best action sequences in the industry- think Resident Evil.
Romance- or rather, lack thereof. As previously stated, Soul and Maka are set up to be the most obvious couple I've ever seen, and again it's played for laughs.
Voice acting- same cast as Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. Shoutout to Maxey Whitehead, who voices Crona, the series Eeyore. By far the best voice job I've heard.
Cursing- Not too bad if you're watching the dub. No f-bombs. However, the sub is pretty bad, and I've heard that in the Hungarian dub, Maka is extremely talented at cursing, noted and praised on several sites.
Sexual jokes- not too many. Maka and Soul's roommate is a catgirl, and the only innuendoage occurs when she appears in episodes 1, 4, 5, 11, 14, and I think the last one is 20, although I'm unsure of that one. They aren't too bad, just some sideways comments here and there. She isn't as big a character in the anime as she is in the manga.

This series ties for my favorite with FMA. I love the fight scenes and characters. I cosplayed Maka for the most recent Halloween and my first convention ever last spring. I wouldn't really recommend it to someone for a first anime unless they are familiar with ideas like catgirls and screaming out the name of every attack before doing it, because it gets pretty annoying pretty fast.

Oh, and the title of my review- at the end of each episode, there is a preview for the next, and the last thing you hear is Maka telling you to watch it or she'll take your soul. Sometimes other characters will butt in and say it for her, quickly followed by something along the lines of ""HEY! THAT'S MY CATCHPHRASE!""

I can't stress enough how happy this series made me.",1351987200,6,4992,4.618940248027058

4374985,5,B004GZZH8A,"Soul Eater is one of the better Anime shows that you can find. The art style and animation are great (and fairly abstract, which I like) with a just as good cast of characters. It features a great mix of Action and Comedy for a total of 51 episodes. This comes in a DVD and Blu-ray version, choosing which one only really depends on your preference of format, but the Blu-ray is shown to be $50 which basically works out to about $1 an episode (that is a great deal for Blu-ray right there)!

I only have two problems, one being with that the show has an unsatisfying conclusion that the series takes (the way the main villain is tackled in the finale). It could have been so much better on that front. Another minor problem I have is also about the strange deviation of plot in the beginning, since they make it a big deal to get all the souls eaten, but after like a few episodes, that entire plot line is basically abandoned to tackle on a presented villain (I don't like being presented a plot and then deviated to another one after quite a few episodes had been given to that previous plot).

These are just minor gripes really, as the show as a whole (even those Excalibur episodes...) is a blast. There is great humor and action to be had with the brilliant cast. You'd be a FOOL (as Excalibur would say...) to miss out on this show, and this is really the best set to buy for it at this time.",1347408000,22,1400,4.2593984962406015

4374988,5,B004GZZH8A,"The DWMA (Death Weapon Meister Academy) is a school that trains weapons and meisters to fight together to defeat kishin. A weapon must consume 99 kishin souls and one witch's soul in order to become a Death Scythe, one of Lord Death's own weapons. The series follows three student pairs - Maka and her scythe Soul, Black Star and his ninja weapon Tsubaki, and Death the Kid, with twin pistols Liz and Patty. Each pair has their own little quirks and strengths. Soul places great emphasis on ""coolness"", Black Star is extremely narcissistic, and Kid is OCD and obsessed with ""symmetry"". When these students aren't out battling evil, they are dealing with problems at school - teachers raising from the dead, mad scientists trying to dissect them, and the surprisingly short quest to find the legendary sword Excalibur. Plus a whole lot more, but you don't want me to ruin it for you, do you?

The art and design for this series is of the hate it or love it style. It is very creative, a bit cartoonish, and occasionally freakish. The moon has eyes and a mouth and drips blood - that kind of thing. I felt that it set the tone of the series perfectly. The music is also surprisingly well done. Lots of anime I've seen have had good scores, but I mostly don't remember them once the show is over. I can't say that I'd go out and buy the soundtrack for this show, but it was memorable enough to stick in my mind. I was also very impressed with the English dub. I normally prefer to watch anime in Japanese (with subtitles) but when a dub is really good I watch it in English. The dub for Soul Eater was very well done and the voice actors for Kid and Crona were especially good.

When I first started this series I wasn't impressed. The first three episodes are used to introduce the three main teams (one episode each) and each episode emphasized their really annoying parts. Black Star's episode is second and it almost made me stop watching the series he was so annoying with his narcissism and ""I'm a big man!"" lines. But that is the most annoying he gets in the entire series, so if he drives you nuts too, just remember that he doesn't get any worse :)

The series does come to an end (rather then just stopping), but it is based on a manga series that is still running, so the ending is a little weak. Basically the writers cheat a bit to finish up the story. But if you look past the cheating, the ending was decent.

This series really grew on me. I grew to really like the characters, love the world, and eagerly await more of the story. I've watched lots of anime (over 300 series) and I occasionally despair for originality. But Soul Eater had originality in spades. It is one of my favorite shows released in the last few years. If you give it a try, make sure to watch at least 6 episodes before passing judgment (because episode 6 is really funny). Enjoy!",1346889600,8,2866,4.4120982986767485

4374996,2,B004GZZH8A,"This is a review on the series as a whole. Soul eater is one of the most over rated anime to come out in a while, while I watched it a few years back, I never thought it would go anywhere. Was I ever wrong. Honestly I have no idea what people see in this series. Other than the fact that it is nothing more than the same shonen shows we've seen before. Naruto, bleach, fairy tail, one piece heck even dragon ball z.

The animation of this series is not what was described to me as awesome. Rather, it is overtly simplistic, as if drawn from a 14 year old. Don't take my word for it, just pause it at any given scene/frame and take a look at there eyes, hair, clothes and background. What you'll notice is the lack of detail. They do however have an impressive amount of frame, while fighting anyways, so the combat is nice and fluid. The fight sequences are also well choreographed, making for some cool fight sequences. While many people hide the animation behind style, I personally didn't see it that way, if anything the style made it appear more cartoony than anything. For me animation is a bg thing, after all an anime is nothing more than hand drawn pictures moving at a frame rate over a background, with some cg of course. I appreciate animators who spend a lot of time and hard work on there projects, conversely I don't really care for show where the animations like. . . meh.

If your looking for a plot you'd best leave this series alone, as it isn't very deep (what shonen series is). There is a overarching story behind everything but its not very important, as you could start this series anywhere and not miss much, in the way of plot device anyway.

Characters, now I read a review that said this series has some of the best characters ever and all I can say is, no offense, but you should probably watch some other anime. As the characters are the most cookie cutter, cliches I have seen since harem style anime. Problem is, is that a lot of them aren't even likable, Black star anyways. maka, the lead character is alright but nothing new and towards the end she, of course rises to the situation with her (guts and courage) or something like that I guess. Out of all the characters in this series I found I only like death the kid and that sexy witch cat girl.

They do try something interesting, in that people have scythes that are also there partners. So are people scythes or are scythes people? I jest, but it is a fun idea, but also one Ive seen before in anime. Sacred blacksmith.

Ending thoughts, this series has some cool fighting and that's about it. there are other, better shonen series to watch, with much better characters and animation. This series just lacks any depth what so ever. So if you like something with some kind of plot, look else where. 52 episodes that could be condensed into a 12 ep series. Animation that while isn't bad, on a technical level is definitely not good, take a while to get used to, and characters that would allow me to feel no sympathy for if they died.",1331164800,13,3023,4.371886120996441

 If you are going to combine two of the most currently popular anime and manga into one, do it right, and Soul Eater does it very well. The art style is unique, and I love it. Everything is over the top and frankly its probably more likeable than Naruto. It has a great overall story and some really cool characters.

As a reader of the manga, I noticed immediately that the content, maturity, and dialogue was very watered down. Most likely to suit an international and younger audience.

4375001,5,B004GZZH8A,"If you enjoy Inuyasha, Fullmetal Alchemist or Yu yu hakusho, you will love Soul Eater. This anime follows the life of Meister Maka and her Weapon Soul. As I always say, you can scroll up to read the plot of this series, and most of you know what this anime is all about, so here are my thoughts.
Soul eater is an anime that has comedy, some seriously awesome fight scenes, magic and a touch of romance (more nonspoken love than full on lovey dovey).
The animation is top notch.
The characters are put together beautifully. Blackstar's ego and Kid's issues with things being perfectly even gets kinda annoying, but they have some pretty amazing skills and fight scenes.
The voice acting is perfection. I love Soul's voice. They casted this series perfectly.
I would have liked to see the romance between Maka and Soul come out more, but its actually a nice pace, having an anime where it isn't focused around saving the world and falling in love. But to all the romantics out there, there are some scenes when there is some Maka/Soul moments, so you won't be disappointed.
The anime does take a drastic turn from the manga, and the whole series is only 51 episodes long, which is alittle sad, because again, another awesome manga is cut short when it hits TV.
This box set has episodes 1-26, and the Weapons Collection has 27-51, in case anyone was wondering or concerned.
So all in all, this anime gets 5 stars from me due to the awesome animation, amazing fight scenes, perfect voice acting and a story line that is well put together, even tho it does not follow the manga.",1316995200,4,1574,4.545774647887324
4375002,5,B004GZZH8A,"I had heard a lot of great things about this series, but I had unintentionally avoided it for some reason. Then a few friends began talking about the show, and I decided to give it a shot. Oh. My. GOD. Everything about this series blew me away. The art was great, the music superb, the English dub was flawless, and the plot and characters are all simply brilliant! Here's a more detailed look:

Plot: Fantastic!
Let me explain a few things before discussing the actual plot. First, it's the terms ""Meister"" and ""Weapon"". A Weapon is, simply put, a person who transforms into a certain weapon, and, if they consume the souls of 99 wicked humans and one witch, they become a Death Scythe, a Weapon wielded by Lor Death himself. A Meister is the person who wields a Weapon in battle. Now that I've explained this, I can discuss the show's plot. The series follows 3 Weapon/Meister teams at the DWMA (Death Weapon Meister Academy), where they train to combat evil: Maka and her Weapon Soul (His weapon type is a scythe), Black Star and his weapon Tsubaki (She transforms into multiple different ninja weapons), and Death the Kid (Lord Death's son) and his Weapons Patty and Liz. Everything starts out by introducing each of the three teams and, after the three prologue episodes, the real plot begins. It starts out very simply, but gets darker as the villains are revealed, and soon everyone is caught in a battle against a witch and her dark plans. Sounds simple enough, but the story is told very well, and it gets better and better as it goes on. I wish I could say more, but that would be difficult to do without spoiling anything.

Characters: BRILLIANT.
The cast is outstanding. Each character is totally unique and quirky, and a certain villain in the series is just plain CREEPY and EVIL. Maka, the central character, is pretty uptight, while her partner, Soul, is very laid-back. Together, they make a great team. Black Star is extremely powerful, and extremely annoying at first, but is actually more than just some aggravating Naruto-type character. His partner, Tsubaki, is the most normal character in the show. She compliments his brash personality perfectly. Now on to Death the Kid. You know that show Monk? The one about the OCD detective guy? Yeeeeeeeeah, well, uhm... Death the Kid makes him look like the most unorganized slob in existence. His Weapons, Patty and Liz, are HILARIOUS. Liz, the older one, is a total coward and HATES things like ghosts and monsters. Then there's Patty. She's, well... different. She basically acts like a 3-year-old, and she frequently had me cracking up.
Then we go to Dr. Stein, one of my favorites! He's a teacher at the DWMA, and he's a total loon! He loves to dissect things, see how they work. This leads some truly hilarious moments! I can't say much about Sid, because it's a neat surprise. Crona and Ragnarok are another pair I can't say too much about, but I will say this: Crona is extremely insecure, and Ragnarok is hilarious. Death Scythe, also known as Spirit, is Maka's father and a total playoy. He's also one of the most powerful Weapons, if not *THE* most powerful Weapon, in the series. Then there's Lord Death, the Grim Reaper! This guy is an oddball. He's not at all how you'd imagine him to be. He's very silly and overall another great character.
I'm giving Blair her own paragraph. Blair is basically a cat with strong magical powers. Her human form is very... well... it's... Ah, screw it, she's extremely well-endowed and is really hot. 'Specially if you have a weakness for cat girls. Heh. She's the source of most of the series' fanservice, and the source of Soul's nosebleeds. Poor Soul!
All in all, this series has some of the best characters I've ever seen.

Music/Acting: Flawless
This series has a great soundtrack that really matches the tone of the scenes. The opening and ending songs are especially good! That's all I really have to say for the music.
As for the acting, it's absolutely FLAWLESS. The only voice that took me time to get used to was Black Star, voiced by Brittney Karbowski. Newcomer Micah Solusod shows alot of talent as Soul, and I'm looking forward to future performances from him. The rest of the cast is also great. Laura Bailey (Maka) does a great job as always, Monica Rial (Tsubaki) shows off her talent to its fullest, and Todd Haberkorn (Death the Kid) pulls off a simply GENIUS performance. Cherami Leigh (Patty) does an awesome job, and Liz's actress (sorry, I can't remember her name!!!!!) does a great job. Chuck Huber does a fantastic job as the insane Dr. Stein, and John Swasey as Lord Death was unforgettable. Maxey Whitehead shows Crona's timid and insecure personality with perfection, and Sonny Strait is just PERFECT as Ragnarok! Luci Christian makes a great villain (whose name I won't reveal!), as does Travis Willingham. Blair's actress (Can't remember her name, sorry!) is fantstic as well. Then there's the almighty Vic Mignogna, in his ABSOLUTELY, UTTERLY, POSITIVELY GEEEEEEENIUUUUUUUUUS role as Spirit! Need I say anymore? The music and acting are both great.

Art: Quirky Awesomeness
Think Tim Burton in anime form. Kinda. It's very odd and Halloweenish. The character designs are awesome, and the fight scenes are intense and engaging. Not much else to say.

Parents: Not for the kids!!!!!!!
I'm going to break this section up to make it easier.
Violence: This show, while not exactly gory, can get bloody at times. Nothing on the scale of Gunslinger Girl: Il Teatrino, but still bloody at times.
Sex/Nudity: No sex or nudty, but lots of fanservice. Mostly in the scenes with Blair, because she likes to shove her chest in Soul's face alot, and wears alot of pretty skimpy outfits that show off her cleavage. Also, the Weapons are sometimes shown in their human forms when in Weapon mode (kinda like a ""separate dimension"" thing), and, when they're in Weapon mode, they're naked. Usually, though, they just show from the shoulders up (except with Soul; they show his chest alot, but that shouldn't be a problem for parents), and no actual nudity is shown.

Overall: PERFECTION.
This series is simply astounding. I'll add more to the review at a later date, but this series is definately worth checking out!",1316304000,3,6242,4.785714285714286
4375003,5,B004GZZH8A,"This is a very stylized annie full of humor, drama, a little romance, witchcraft, demons, blood, and did I mention Blair!!!!!

4375004,5,B004GZZH8A,I found this to be a good series. Not too violent. Actually had some morals which is a plus but not needed.  Cute characters and a good story line. There were a few twists and turns in the story. The story line could be a bit pradicable but there were enough laughs to keep me going.

4375005,2,B004GZZH8A,"This show had lots of potential in the beginning, but it switches which character it focus's on. This makes it really hard care about any of the characters, since you hardly spend anytime with the characters.

This show also suffers from having completely pointless episodes that in no way relate to the story. The main story arc is very good, it's just that they don't focus on it enough.

This show has an interesting art style, and it always pleases the eyes.

The main complaint I have with this show is the super lame ending. With all it's build up and skills gained, the day is saved by something you could read off a cereal box.",1313107200,5,635,4.456896551724138
4375006,5,B004GZZH8A,"For the first few episodes, I wasn't too impressed. It seemed like a standard anime with some action and sexy gags and didn't appear to have much substance. But after the introductory episodes, the series picks up with fantastic pacing, a perfect blend of comedy and seriousness, and great characters you will quickly grow to love (even if you didn't care for them much in the first three prologue episodes).

I've had a hard time finding good anime Blu-Rays, since initial selections seemed slim, and my old favorite shows weren't easily making the jump from SD to HD. Soul Eater was a great find, being a more modern show, and looks spectacular in HD. Everything looks crisp, clean, and vibrant, with high-quality animation. It was definitely a great addition to my fledgling Blu-Ray anime collection.

This series is definitely worth a watch, but you must make it through the first handful of episodes to see it really shine. I think it may even make a great introductory series for those new to anime, as it includes common elements of many series without going too heavy on them (such as random English words, aspects of Japanese culture, character personality quirks, and gags). Give Soul Eater a chance!",1312588800,,1210,4.868932038834951
4375007,5,B004GZZH8A,"This soul eater on blu-ray came on may 28th and I had to watch it some time when I was in room in scenic veiw Academy the 1-9 ep.s were very good and HD was good and tell a very good about soul eater and happen in the ep.s in each one so that good...

So the eps go 1-26 eps on the first ep. the charater was named soul and maka and she using soul as her weapon to evil kishin monster to kill and eat the kishin egg and collect 99 and one witch to become the ulimate death scythes , weapons capable of being used by shinigami.[1] In the universe of Soul Eater, witches are powerful beings and the natural enemies of DWMA, as almost all of them have a destructive nature and desire anarchy.

Funimation tells good story about charater named crona or you can say chrona how ever you want to say it... its a interneting charater that you be confused that if its he or she very hard to tell and the charater is funny in disc 3 and the way charater acts the attacks are good with slash with sword when the uses Ragnarok  to collect non-evil human souls to transform Crona into a kishin (<S_?), an evil demon god. Medusa and her cohorts attack DWMA with the intention of reviving Asura, the first kishin who nearly plunged the entire world into madness before being sealed beneath DWMA by Shinigami.

ps disc 3 was very epic indeed and awesome and it be awesome when aug. 9th comes  because the end will be cool and Franken Stein  is awesome charater when says I want to dissect you and a cool attack that he does and this is info: A mad scientist who works as a teacher at DWMA. His name is a reference to Mary Shelley's novel/character Frankenstein. He views everything in the world as a specimen to be experimented on, including himself, leading him to drive a large screw through the side of his head and interweave his own skin, clothes, and even his laboratory with stitches.

He normally serves as a kindly father figure to his students, though he suffers from chronic bouts of madness that compel him to try and dissect anything in sight, wearing a twisted and sadistic smirk during these intervals. I did like the anime seris it be cool there maybe a soul eater 2 and no the an edit names ok...",1311120000,,2197,4.292270531400966
4375008,5,B004GZZH8A,"A series where once you start, you don't want to stop! The art is definitely unique and the characters are quite amusing, although all the episodes with Excalibur could be omitted. Not that I hate him or anything.

In the series follows the life and adventures of some of the students at the Death Weapon Meister Academy, where students train in either being a Weapon or a Meister. In order to finish your training you have to defeat and the Weapon has to eat 99 souls that are on Lord Death's list and a Witch's soul. The Witch's soul is the hardest to attain, therefore it typically done last. If it is obtained sooner, than it is held until the correct amount of souls is achieved. In cases where the final soul is a different kind of soul, all the previous souls are considered null and void and the weapon/meister duo starts back at 0. Crazy things happen, quite a few characters are introduced with some back-story on the more important ones. I hope you enjoy!

Soul Eater had everything! There was plenty of action, comedy, and even a few corny bits that are a guilty pleasure! There are a few parts that get annoying and sometimes doesn't even make sense (like how the heck do they get around the world?), but those are within acceptable limits.

The preview's and the English track do appear as Dolby TrueHD, just not the Japanese track. If I didn't need it to complete the collection, I would cancel the order for the second half of the series, Soul Eater: The Weapons Collection. I'm sure Funimation will screw this one up also with poor english dubbing and even worse sub-titling. It's as though they do not care for the native language or having to add sub-titles to support it either.

One can only hope that other Japanese studios see the terrible job Funimation does and send their business elsewhere.",1310169600,,879,4.670967741935484

I will say that my only problem is how all 26 episodes from the first season is spread out on 3 disc, when they all most likely could of fit on one Blu Ray disc, (and probably the entire series at that).

(Non spoilerific review)

Soul Eater is an anime about Maka and Soul, they both go to DWMA a school for Meisters/Weapons. They have a goal of collecting 100 Souls to turn Soul into a Deathscythe and generally be the best they can be.

At this school are other people such as Black Star, Death the Kid, and their weapons too. The weapons are living beings that take the form of humans, and when needed in battle, transform into a weapon and are wieded by their meisters.

Basically the fun in this show is the characters and the battles they get into, as well as the situations, though the series can have a dark tone to it at times, it has a great sense of humor and is fun to watch.

The battles are entertaining, the dialogue fun. The dub is also very good.

I understand my review is mostly non descriptive but this is more not to spoil the series before you've watched.

Worth noting this show was done by the same people that did Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood and looks fantastic in HD.",1309392000,2,1223,4.552511415525114
4375013,5,B004GZZH8A,This anime is probably one of the coolest anime shows that I have ever watched. It is a great purchase for anyone who loves anime.

4375014,5,B004GZZH8A,"The DWMA (Death Weapon Meister Academy) is a school that trains weapons and meisters to fight together to defeat kishin. A weapon must consume 99 kishin souls and one witch's soul in order to become a Death Scythe, one of Lord Death's own weapons. The series follows three student pairs - Maka and her scythe Soul, Black Star and his ninja weapon Tsubaki, and Death the Kid, with twin pistols Liz and Patty. Each pair has their own little quirks and strengths. Soul places great emphasis on ""coolness"", Black Star is extremely narcissistic, and Kid is OCD and obsessed with ""symmetry"". When these students aren't out battling evil, they are dealing with problems at school - teachers raising from the dead, mad scientists trying to dissect them, and the surprisingly short quest to find the legendary sword Excalibur. Plus a whole lot more, but you don't want me to ruin it for you, do you?

The art and design for this series is of the hate it or love it style. It is very creative, a bit cartoonish, and occasionally freakish. The moon has eyes and a mouth and drips blood. That kind of thing. I felt that it set the tone of the series perfectly. The music is also surprisingly well done. Lots of anime I've seen have had good scores, but I mostly don't remember them once the show is over. I can't say that I'd go out and buy the soundtrack for this show, but it was memorable enough to stick in my mind. I was also very impressed with the English dub. I normally prefer to watch anime in Japanese (with subtitles) but when a dub is really good I watch it in English. The dub for Soul Eater was very well done and the voice actors for Kid and Crona were especially good.

When I first started this series I wasn't impressed. The first three episodes are used to introduce the three main teams (one episode each) and each episode emphasized their really annoying parts. Black Star's episode is second and it almost made me stop watching the series he was so annoying with his narcissism and ""I'm a big man!"" lines. But that is the most annoying he gets in the entire series, so if he drives you nuts too, just remember that he doesn't get any worse :)

This series really grew on me. I've grown to really like the characters, love the world, and eagerly await more of the story. I've watched lots of anime (over 300 series) and I occasionally despair for originality. But Soul Eater had originality in spades. It is one of my favorite shows released in the last few years. If you give it a try, make sure to watch at least 6 episodes before passing judgment (because episode 6 is really funny). Enjoy!",1300233600,54,2603,4.464285714285714
4375015,5,B004GZZH8A,"Soul Eater has a unique art style that gets some getting used to but once you do...you realize how awesome it is. It's hard to describe but I really love it, when I read the first chapter of Soul Eater manga I was actually wishing for the art to look more like its anime counterpart. Also the opening song...is completely addicting I am in LOVE with this opening! This song is stuck in my head night and day and the accompanying animation really suits it.

Why did I start watching this series? There was a lot of hype around it as the `next hit shonen series' and in all honesty I've never been a part of any of the hit shonen series from episode 1 so I thought I'd follow this one right from the start. The first 3 introductory episodes were ok...I felt a lot of fanatic fans that were raving about it at that point were prematurely excited. But after that point things started picking up fast and now I'm completely involved with the plot. It's a great combination of action/comedy, my ideal anime is one with addicting action and humor that makes me laugh out loud a lot...and so far Soul Eater is only the 2nd series to accomplish this. The author has also wet my curiosity as to how strong these defective characters really are when they momentarily overcome their (usually) incapacitating personality flaws.

This series is overflowing with ridiculously awesome characters and completely random humor, I love it! A random aspect that I really admire is that the author dared to make a female the protagonist  as a girl that enjoys Shonen I really enjoy this change. The only other series that I've read/watched (thats considered Shonen) that has a female protagonist is Claymore.",1297209600,34,1686,4.632107023411371
