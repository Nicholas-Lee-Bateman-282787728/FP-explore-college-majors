1908619,5,B0000AQVIP,"I just want to add to the very fine precis already posted a brief correction about location (Netflix has it wrong, too--they claim it's set in west London.)  To those, such as myself, who are fanatical about English football the location is obvious from the very first seconds of the film, when ""I'm forever blowing bubbles"" is sung in the background and the camera pans down to an aerial view of the Boleyn Ground (Upton Park.) And throughout the film the central character and his younger brother sport the famous claret and blue of West Ham United--one of the best loved (though under-achieving) clubs in England, the pride of the Cockney homeland of London's East End.

I'm adding an extra star just for all the West Ham references!",1154563200,5,736,4.7421875
1908640,5,B0000AQVIP,Fascinating look at the real side of the drug scene. Families are formed and broken by an out of control world. Talented performances abound in this small movie that should have been bigger. David Wenham is great as the drug dealer who does not get that he can't make families and supply them drugs at the same time.,1391990400,,316,4.4655172413793105
1908641,1,B0000AQVIP,"Dreadful film.  I bought the DVD expecting to see a compelling story revolving around Molly Parker's character (and Keira Knightly's).  Instead, 95% involves the creepy ten-year-old boy, whose acting is ""purely"" awful, and whose character is nowhere close to believable.  The only thing more irritating is the soundtrack, which consists of endlessly repeated obnoxious short themes.  The only way this film deserves even one star is Molly Parker, who gives her usual superb performance, albeit in an almost non-existent peripheral role.",1388966400,3,536,5.580246913580247
1908642,5,B0000AQVIP,"Emotionally disturbing and realistic portrayal of the dark side and sinister nature of drug addiction, and the hell it can drag a person through, as well as the people who love them!",1379116800,,182,4.71875
1908643,5,B0000AQVIP,"kimikiss is a funny romantic comedy.  I don't tend to like romances, but the thing that made me hooked on this is that the story was believable.  It's not one of those stories where its a one in a million chance that the romance is going to happen.  The romance develops and has twist just like real life would.  i recommend this to anyone who has the smallest amount of a romance bone in them.  its got everything needed for a good  romance show.",1366848000,,447,4.261904761904762
1908644,5,B0000AQVIP,"I think this is Harry Eden's lst movie. He is very young, but is the dominate character in this sensitive human drama between a drug addicted mother and her son. It is really an awesome movie one should not miss, especially a Harry Eden fan.",1322179200,,241,4.377777777777778
1908645,5,B0000AQVIP,"Here is an anime with wonderful characters in lovetriangles with no straw-men set up to take the fall and no farcical characters which exist merely to incur our hatred - such as you will find in so many movies. Every character is sympathetic and loveable, with endearing faults and character development.
In the first few episodes it was difficult for me to keep all the characters straight, they were introduced all at once but they soon blossomed into beautiful and fully fleshed out characters which had me craving for more and at times on the verge of tears (quite an accomplishment since like most men I find it hard to cry). The story is set at a laid back pace, but not too slow. In the end the lovestories were some of the most beautiful I have seen.",1299369600,4,758,4.5
1908646,5,B0000AQVIP,"This series is similar to ""Clannad."" It's a ""slice-of-life"" romantic comedy set in a Japanese high school. It's very sweet, very touching . . . and very, very funny! The music! Ooo,the music!! It's first rate!!! The opening song (""Aozora loop"" by Marble) is FANTASTIC . . . and so is the 2nd closing song {""Wasurenaide"" by Suara). And it's clean! Like ""Clannad"" there is no fan-service. For the young lovers just holding hands is a big deal! Differences from ""Clannad"" include not a ""harem"" comedy, no supernatural element (other than love itself), and is a little like Fellini's ""8 1/2"" in that there's a movie being made inside a movie! (This effects one of the storylines in an interesting way.) Collection 1 and Collection 2 are BOTH amazingly great! (The one just continues the other.) As to drawbacks . . . there's no dub (but, to be honest, you hardly notice); no extras; background animation is sometimes a little too water-colorish; and--o, yes!--that title! [Blush.] While the story IS a wee bit saccharine (but I LOVE that about it!), the title is WAY over-the-top too sugary for it. Maybe something about love triangles, green and pink puppets, and udon (!) would have been better. Anyway, if you love ""Clannad,"" I think you'll love this series, too.",1299283200,3,1262,4.820276497695852
1908647,4,B0000AQVIP,"This edgey drama about the hoplessness of poverty and drug addiction has the veiwer plunging into the depths of despair, and finally lifted into the arms of hope.  Young David Wenham is inspiring as the oldest son of a hoplessly heroine dependent mother played admirably by Molly Parker.  Wenham's range of emotion is surprising and broad for so young an actor.  Keira Knightley is typically brilliant as the young boy's emotionally challenged friend and, unfortunately, his dark enabler.  Knightley's character's struggle with her circumstance and the better angels of her nature yield a performance equally inspiring to those of Parker and Wenham.
  In the end, you are left cheering for the mother's apparent recovery, and wrenching decline of the friend.  I'd recommend this film to anyone not already swallowing antidepressants.  For those who are, see a nice romantic comedy.",1253404800,2,881,5.287769784172662
1908648,4,B0000AQVIP,"""Pure"" could be viewed simply as a drug addiction movie, but I was relieved to find that it isn't simply that, as I've seen too many overwrought addiction movies at this point. ""Pure"" is the story of a 10-year-old boy trying to save his mother -save her from heroin, from her dealer, and from the law. Mel (Molly Parker) has been overwhelmed by life's demands since the death of her husband left her with 2 young boys to raise. She turned to heroin for consolation, but it got the best of her. She can no longer hold down a job or meet her children's needs. Young Paul (Harry Eden) knows only that his mother is sick, and he will do anything to help her -the household chores, look after his little brother, even prepare the ""medicine"" that makes Mel feel better. But Paul slowly realizes that something is not quite right with his mother. He doggedly tries to understand and resolves to help his mother kick her habit. But Paul finds himself navigating a complicated world of conflicting interests and values: his possessive grandmother (Geraldine McEwan), his mother's manipulative dealer (David Wenham), a police detective (Gary Lewis), Social Services, and his new friend Louise (Keira Knightley), a young woman with a heroin problem of her own.

I love the genuineness of Paul and Mel's relationship. Paul acts exactly as a bright, independent child would. He's fiercely protective of his mother. And he does what's best as he sees it, with limited perspective and little power, to help his mother and preserve his family. He pursues his goal with the single-mindedness and acceptance of a child and the determination of an adult. Paul and Mel express a closeness that is characteristic of a parent and child who work together to survive under difficult circumstances. They're flawed, and they know it. ""Pure"" has a great supporting cast, but there are many moments when Paul carries this film on his shoulders, which is a credit to writer Alison Hume, director Gillies MacKinnon, and Harry Eden, who was actually 12 years old when ""Pure"" was made. Keira Knightley was 16 or 17 when she played Louise, a likable young waitress who refuses to get her life under control no matter what the consequences, and Knightly fans will find this a promising example of her early work. ""Pure""'s pacing could have been better. It's plodding at times. But the film's young perspective and honest emotion won me over.

The DVD (Indican 2006): Bonus features include a theatrical trailer, a Photo Gallery of 11 publicity stills and behind-the-scenes photos, a Poster Progression slideshow of 8 movie posters, a slideshow of 8 cast and crew bios (text), and an interview with director Gillies MacKinnon (34 min). The interview with MacKinnon is interesting, but it seems interminable. Too much of a good thing. He discusses the idea that ""Pure"" is not about heroin but about a ""little boy's heroic attempt to save his mother'"", in contrast to his 1990 film ""Needle"", working with a child actor, the reason the film unfortunately got an 18 rating in the UK, creating the mother/son relationship, colors, camera work, score, and more.",1155427200,22,3120,4.884905660377359

7997834,5,B0000AQVIP,"well, first thing I should mention about this film is the music. It was so touching and well arranged with each moments that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Mainly with the guitar with the keyboard sound that fakes to sound like chamber orchestra together. It makes the moments surround with melancoly and sympathatic feeling.
The story is about a boy who's mother(Molly Parker) is a heroin addict. He has to be apart with his mother in the middle of the movie because her mother has to be in an institution. He has a woman friend who is way older then him(Keira Knightley) who is also a drug eddict who is also pregnant.
The boy is practically surrounded with junckies. He once even wanted to feel what his mother feels and tries to smoke weed and totally wasted. That moment was very touching for me since he has the most innocent boy was corrupted and he was in a totally in a nother world at that time because ot the adult's toy.
The movie ends with a happy ending somehow, more of an open ending. It acutally owns a great amount of deal to the music.
Without the music this movie could not have been this great.
There are actually two kinds of music in this film. One is as already told you. the guitar sound with keyboard faking the chamber orchestra, the other is house music- electric pop. They are all so great.
If the musician was selected by the director he must have been a genious.
It is no surprise knowing that the director is an old guy who has a lot of movie making experience both in TV and Theater.
This is something you should see if you can make time.",1457481600,,1580,4.341216216216216
