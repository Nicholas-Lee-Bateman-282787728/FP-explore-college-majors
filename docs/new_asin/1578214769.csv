7799123,4,1578214769,Chuck Missler really outlines future events well. Part 1 of the DVD defines the biblical Genieology of the cast of characters during the tribulation. Part 2 discusses current technologies and how they will impact coming events.,1374105600,,227,5.333333333333333
7799124,5,1578214769,"If you enjoy the study of ""End Time Prophecy"" you will be challenged by this ""alternate view"" as titled by Mr. Missler.  I always suggest a viewer be near the remote to stop the video or CD in order to take notes, as Mr. Missler is fast in delivery and drops references to his points that need written down for later study.  I personally enjoy alternate views in order to look deeper into the Word of God myself so if you are like me, this would make a great addition to your library.",1363219200,,484,4.193548387096774
