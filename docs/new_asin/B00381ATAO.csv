8390945,1,B00381ATAO,"I've said it before, but seriously...This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. And I've seen alot. Bad acting, bad storyline. Nothing made sense. Even the blood was bad. It looked more like Grape Jelly then blood. Thats right, Grape Jelly. Not even Strawberry. And to make matters worse, it has two brothers that look like the Hanson Twins in it.",1356739200,,352,4.603174603174603
8390946,2,B00381ATAO,"The production on this was decent, but the story totally fails at the end. Starts off like a mystery ghost story and ends like a needy gore flick.

First off, congrats for finishing it. Most people never even finish their films.

Production:
I'd seen the trailer here on Amazon on Demand, but didn't see it until it was on Netflix. The footage make a heavy use of Magic Bullet-eque coloring and has a few sound issues here and there, but I've heard worse. The music was great, although it didn't always fit the scene. The acting of OK, only 1 or 2 people really seems to do well. The set and location are awesome. I would like to see a real investigation if the place exists.

Story:
It was decent right up until you get to the climax and goes to the end making no sense at all. I was enjoying everything until the 2 blonde dudes and Matt starting confronting the owner at dinner. Then it really starts to decline from there. The story doesn't resolve, the killing don't make any sense, there is not explanation for anything that happens, finally, the end tries to make an ironic close, but just ends up being off story.

If you're a ghost investigator, you'll won't like it.
If you're into ghost stories, you won't like it.
If you're into gore, you'll think it's really tame.

If you like watching REAL independent movies, then you might watch it. I gave it 2 stars, but I actually don't like it...so I'm upgrading for the production value.",1309046400,2,1441,4.4638783269961975
8390947,1,B00381ATAO,"Not suspense as much as gore. There was no resolution, and the plot was non-existent. Must have saved a fortune in script writing.",1300320000,3,130,4.695652173913044
8390948,5,B00381ATAO,"This was a fabulous indie horror/supernatural/ghost story movie I found on my instant streaming account & I just LOVED IT!!  Being a fan of this genre for about 35 years, it's rare for a movie to actually make me jumpy, but this one really scared me!!  I thoroughly enjoyed the suspense & creepy atmosphere they presented in the upper floors of the building above the restaurant...  The fresh ingredients of the cinematography, lighting, sound, story, directing, editing & acting all blended together perfectly for a deliciously scary romp!!  Hollywood should take notice of the team that made this wonderful piece de resistance work of art!!!

PS, I'd like to pre-order the snake tartare...",1299974400,,691,5.079646017699115
8390949,5,B00381ATAO,"SAW THIS IN A FILM FEST IN COLORADO SPRING, COLORADO LAST SPRING. IT WAS VERY ENTERTAINING AND HAD SOLID ACTING FOR AN UNKNOWN CAST. THE REAL TREAT CAME WITH THE CINEMATOGRAPHY AND THE SETTING. SUPER CREEPY, ENGAGING, AND THRILLING FILM ALL AT THE SAME TIME. THE ONLY CRITICISM I COULD ADD WAS THAT IT WAS TOO CHATTY AT TIMES AND NOT ENOUGH ACTION. DARE I CALL IT A CLASSY HORROR FILM?",1266192000,3,385,4.436619718309859
