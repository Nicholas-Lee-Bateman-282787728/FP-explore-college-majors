2442387,5,B000BUJO1U,"This was a great movie. It falls under the radar because it's not an action or a special effects picture. It really shows you what we're missing by watching too many films like Avatar or The Bourne Identity which are primarily action and plot. Donald Sutherland is superb, just riveting to watch. But the standouts for me were Joshua Reynolds and Juliette Lewis who seem completely convincing as the young lovers. The dialogue is great, even the minor characters have superb arcs of development. The main character, Duncan, (Joshua Reynolds) is so sympathetic. We have been in his place, 20-something, wondering what life holds for us, hanging on to the old neighbourhood and the old friends. If you want to watch a film that genuinely moves you, that seems much like a look into someone's life, then see this gem. It's a pity that it did not get wider realize because it's gotten great critical reviews. Hats off to writer Brent Boyd and new director James Burke.",1296432000,,964,4.778443113772455
2442388,5,B000BUJO1U,The movie is great! It is a little bit of a tear jerker but it is still really good!,1252972800,,84,3.473684210526316
2442389,5,B000BUJO1U,"Main character in this movie is young man Duncan in his early twenties.  He has dropped out of college and has difficulty holding onto jobs.  His older brother Jacob is having a successful career in the bank; but is cheating on his wife by using his younger brother's appartment with his (co-worker) lover.  Soon we learn that both brothers are deeply hurt by the sudden death of their father almost 10 years ago.  Their mother has moved to Florida and visits them once a year during summer for a week.  Story unfolds in Minneapolis, during winter months which helps us focus on the story itself.  There is not much to do in Minneapolis during cold months.  Duncan is doting to his grandparents, particularly his grandfather.  Both miss, in their own way, Duncan's father David.  Grandfather is getting sick (Parkinson's, dementia, kidney and heart problems) and depressed but still wants to help his grandson in finding a direction in life.  So it happens that the path to finding a way is thru a home aide, young woman who (Juliette Lewis) checks on the grandfather's health and has a crush on young Dunkan.

For anyone who has ever lost someone dearly loved, this is deeply emotional film.  It is sensitive but not overbearing.  Film is also full of hope.  It is comforting to know that no matter how difficult it is to deal with loss, and the fact that sometimes it may take a long time for any person to come to terms with a loss of another person, we all have to find our own way to reconcile our feelings, intentions and define our future from that point on.

Wonderful cast includes Juliette Lewis, Joshua Jackson, Katie Griffin and K. Sutherland.",1231286400,,1655,4.658620689655172

2442391,5,B000BUJO1U,"Now this is great movie-making. Ensemble cast is top notch. Script is fabulous, and the soundtrack works great. There isn't a gun anywhere except when Donald Sutherland tries to commit suicide, but it's brief. Sutherland is outstanding in his role as grandpa. A film about life, and home and the meaning of it all. Of course, boy gets girl, but that's one of the few cliches here. Watch this!",1217894400,3,392,4.695652173913044
2442392,5,B000BUJO1U,"I can relate to Sutherland's role as a bitter old man with Parkinson's.  My father is in this very condition and the Donald plays it perfectly.  This could not have been an easy part for him.  All the acting was supurb for that matter.  Excellent film, my wife and I highly recommend.

If this movie touched you, also try 'Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont'.",1199664000,,354,4.46875
2442393,5,B000BUJO1U,"AURORA BOREALIS is a superb film by James Burke ('In Dark Places' and 'Tis a Gift to Be Simple') from a story by  Brent Boyd ('The Green Room' and 'Crazy') and if this film is a sample of how these two fine talents collaborate, we can only hope for more.  The cast assembled for this movie gives evidence that the actors deeply admire their vision: it is well deserved.

The setting is winter in Minneapolis, the hometown of the Shorter family: Grandfather Ronald (Donald Sutherland), Grandmother Ruth (Louise Fletcher), and the two grandsons Duncan (Joshua Jackson) and Jacob (Steven Pasquale).  The boys' father died at age 39 (10 years prior to the opening of the story) and both boys grew up on their own, feeling deserted by a father who had been a cocaine abuser at one time.  Duncan had been a champion hockey player, but when his father died his goals diminished and he has been in and out of odd jobs without a solid look at his future.  Jacob runs a nursing home business and when he is not working, he is bringing his girlfriends to Duncan's flat for trysts.  Duncan cares for his grandfather Ronald who has multiple illnesses (Parkinson's Disease, dementia) yet who maintains a humble life with Ruth.  As Ronald's condition deteriorates, Duncan takes a handyman's job in the complex where his grandparents live and during this time the two men bond more closely than ever: Ronald's fading mind sees northern lights from his apartment window and Duncan out of love and growing understanding lets him believe they are real. Ronald is aware of his mental instability and lets Duncan know that he would like to take his life with a shotgun, an idea Duncan prevents.

Ronald and Ruth have a health care provider Kate (Juliette Lewis) whom they trust and love and encourage Duncan to seek out as a partner.  Kate and Duncan date and fill the wide gaps in each other's personalities, yet when the opportunity comes for Kate to move to sunny San Diego, she is unable to make Duncan budge from his safe routine existence in Minneapolis. But as Duncan's resistance is broken down (he learns from a mentor that his father did not die of cocaine abuse, Ronald dies a natural death, etc), he views Kate as the person who can alter his outlook and his life.

Every member of this cast is extraordinary: Donald Sutherland creates a man eaten by Parkinson's Disease and dementia without ever becoming a caricature, Louise Fletcher reminds us how self-effacing her acting has always been, Juliette Lewis turns in one of her most sensitive roles, and Joshua Jackson finds every nuance of the troubled but needy Duncan and engages our empathy. Each of the smaller rolls is likewise pitch perfect, no doubt due in large part to the sensitive direction of Burke.  It is so refreshing to watch a film as meaningful in message and in skillful acting as this, a movie that restores our confidence in film as art.  Highly recommended.

2442394,5,B000BUJO1U,Good film for younger and older adults. Many different stories going on within the movie which keeps people interested.  Excellent acting.,1179014400,13,138,5.571428571428571
2442395,5,B000BUJO1U,"I just love this movie.  The film isn't manipulative or preachy, it just tells a story and tells it well and manages to make you care about every single character, which is quite an accomplishment. This is James Burke's first film, and I hope he makes many more because he is a talent. He has quite a way with actors (he got a great performance out of everyone, even the smallest characters) and a great sense of tone and control. He also was able to balance the humor of the script with the pathos, and never make it feel forced.

The performances are subtle yet perfectly spot on, with the standouts being Joshua Jackson and Donald Sutherland. This is a true leading man role for Jackson, and takes him beyond just being ""Pacey"" into being a great, adult actor. Donald Sutherland is also a revelation, and their acting chemistry is fantastic.

If you like films about real characters and real emotions, you should see this movie -- you won't be disappointed.",1175558400,13,960,4.60233918128655

Some movies for some reason don't merit adequate studio marketing budgets, and the rest of us fans suffer because of it. Politics and money -- what life seems to boil down to these days. Not sure what's up with Amazon.com and its tendency to leave out DVD special feautres information, but for the record this one includes: Production Commentary; Interviews with Cast & Crew; and Isolated Music Track.",1363651200,,493,4.744186046511628

2442411,5,B000BUJO1U,"I love Joshua Jackson's acting he always gives a very believable preformance that draws you into the movie as if you are there with him in the story.  Donald Sutherland him self is a wonderful actor and his preformance brings you face to face with what you yourself might feel if you were in the shoes of this character.  It's a very touching story of a young man who has issues about his father's death and his relationship with his grandfather.  His grandfather played by Mr. Sutherland is fading with disease. I myself have seen the results of the disease and Mr. Sutherland nails the part perfectly.  Who would want to survive alhiemer's and forget not only who you are but those you cherish?  Mr. Jackson shows deep emotion on not only how to deal with what is happening to his beloved grandfather but his own failures in his own life and finding love and hope, In the end his grandfather's miss with suicide still ends in tragedy as he dies from a heart attach instead.  Most might find this more of a love story with a love interest wanting him to move away with her.  While that maybe true the story is much deeper then that.  It's the story of a young man coming to terms with tragedy and being able to move on from it.",1362009600,,1228,4.378854625550661
2442412,5,B000BUJO1U,I have been searching for this movie at a reasonable price for several years.  No store carries it nor seems to have even heard of the movie - what a shame.  I would recommend this movie as well as the seller to anyone!,1358985600,,219,4.069767441860465
2442413,4,B000BUJO1U,"This is a film about family and how they deal with loss, aging, finding themselves, and trying to cope in general.  Duncan, played by Joshua Jackson is a young man who has been fired from many jobs, drives a junker that has just quit, has a brother who is successful but he has issues as well.  While visiting his grandparents, played by the very talented Donald Sutherland and Louise Fletcher he discovers that there is a position for a handyman.  This allows Duncan to spend more time with his grandparents, his grandfather with limited mobility due to Parkinson's disease, and his grandmother the more capable spouse just needing some emotional support.  Duncan is also dealing with the unexplained death of his father, a former cocaine addict.  Enter Kate, a caregiver who sees Ronald and Ruth, the grandparents and meets Duncan.  As their relationship grows Kate is puzzled by Duncan's immature behavior as well as his reluctance to change his circumstances which to her seem very limited.  With the help of Kate, Duncan begins to realize that his life can be so much more and where he has grown up and lived all his life is just a place.  The perky Juliette Lewis did an excellent job playing Kate, beautiful, caring, and taking on Duncan, his family, and his obnoxious hockey buddies!",1354060800,,1291,4.8099547511312215
