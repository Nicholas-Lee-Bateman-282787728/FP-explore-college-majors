7801398,5,193042955X,"Love & Logic is a GREAT way to teach your children how much you love them, but also helping them learn boundaries and how to become healthy adults.  We have so much FUN with our toddler and she is such a happy little girl that everyone just adores!",1390867200,,248,4.166666666666667
7801399,5,193042955X,"Busy parents with Toddlers,
I thought the video would be a great way to start and include my husband.  I discovered that we rarely have 2 solid hours together to do this, but it was a good start.  The hard part is that when you want to remember something from the video, it's hard to find the time to navigate a DVD to revisit/review.  And sometimes you just want a straight and quick answer.  Having a book to go with it is helpful because it's easier to skim and refer to when situations arise.  We bought ""Love and Logic Magic for Early Childhood: Practical Parenting From Birth to Six Years"" and have been happy with the results so far!",1389484800,2,640,4.34453781512605
7801400,3,193042955X,Information for frustrated parents delivered in a humorous fashion that kept a viewer's attention on the message.  Wish it had delivered its message to parents in a way to give more depth of understanding.  Love and Logic workbook scenarios to accompany the DVD would help parents to learn to apply techniques.,1384646400,,310,5.0588235294117645
7801401,5,193042955X,"Love and Logic! This is the video for training toddlers. I wish I knew about it when I was raising my kids, but I am using it in a parenting class at a Pregnancy Center and the parents are having great results with it once they get the principles down. I got it for my adult children to use with my grandkids. Perhaps they will have a less painful parenting experience!",1367020800,3,369,4.211267605633803
7801402,5,193042955X,"I know that Love & Logic works because my sister uses it on her very strong-willed daughter.  It teaches children think and own their decisions by keeping it simple, being consistent and allowing children to experience the consequences of their actions.  And, it's all done with empathy & love.  It makes so much sense!  A must have for any parent who is looking for time-tested techniques that work!",1362009600,2,400,4.838235294117647

7801404,5,193042955X,"I am a very big Love and Logic fan - every parent needs it! If you can't take a Love/Logic class, or want a booster after reading the book or learning about L/L, this is a great video. Okay, this is a great video anyway! Once you hear the instinctive wisdom of Love/Logic you are just going to want to hear more from them.",1274313600,8,322,4.046875
7801405,5,193042955X,"I am a parenting educator in our local community.  I recently reviewed the Love and Logic curriculum, including this DVD.  Many of the curriculums I have reviewed tend to talk ""at"" the parents, not provide hands on skills that they can relate to.  This DVD provides examples of child behaviors every parent has encountered and great ideas for how to handle these behaviors using empathy and natural/ logical consequences for the child's behavior; all the while putting the responsibility for correcting the behavior right back on the child - where it belongs.  If you're a parent encountering arguing and resistance, this is a wonderful parenting tool.",1269129600,10,652,5.122641509433962
