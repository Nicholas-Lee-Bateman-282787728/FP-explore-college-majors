8110783,4,B000EJSH2K,"Beautiful footage, mostly during the summer.  We have been there once and the big trees just cannot be given justice on any video, you have to be there in person.  This helped me remember why I loved the area when we visited.",1412467200,,225,4.333333333333333
8110784,5,B000EJSH2K,I have been to Sequoia a couple of times years ago. This video brought back many good memories of those trips. Well done,1378857600,,120,4.260869565217392
8110785,3,B000EJSH2K,"It did save me a trip to King's Canyon in December, so I'm glad I picked it up. I expected more though, it seemed like a collection of public television footage over the years. There wasn't enough footage of the park, especially during different seasons. Wish I'd rented it from the library instead of buying it.",1288656000,3,312,4.589285714285714
8110786,5,B000EJSH2K,"This is a very nice overview of the featured national parks, highlighting what to see, where to go, giving you a historical background (with old pictures and documents as well as commentaries), geological and biological information on the natural wonders in the parks. Definitely a good resource to prepare your visit to one of America's most beautiful parks...",1182038400,4,361,5.241379310344827
8110787,5,B000EJSH2K,"My husband and I love Sequoia/Kings Canyon National Parks, and this DVD is an excellent mini-tour of all these parks have to offer.  It's about a 5-6 hour drive to the Parks from where we live, so whenever we get ""homesick"" for our favorite getaway spot, we just pop in this DVD and relive former visits to this special place.  The peaceful music, excellent & well-written narration, and outstanding photography show the parks in all their spendor at all times of the year.  Bonus features are also fun and include a ""trivia"" game and special tour of the Caverns with new facts that not even we knew about.  Whether you are new to Sequoia or one of its seasoned veteran hikers, you'll love this DVD.  We do!",1177113600,5,707,4.535433070866142
8110788,5,B000EJSH2K,"Just about any Finley-Holiday video will be worth your money. High-quality shooting, good cinematography, informative voice-overs and very fitting musical scoring all add up to make a great series.

Plus, videos in the Finley-Holiday series normally have bonus features, such as sidebar attractions in the area.

This one in particular is worthwhile because, while devoting plenty of time to Sequoia, nothing major is skimped on Kings Canyon coverage.",1136160000,2,451,5.617647058823529
