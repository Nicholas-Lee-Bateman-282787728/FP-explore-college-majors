8388575,4,B00350O20G,"I've been a fan of Acadia for quite a while and have camped there numerous times as well as visited on the way through to other destinations.  Back when I went the first time, there were no DVDs and you used a cassette tape in your car to hear the descriptions of the features around the park.  Later on, Perkins released a VCR tape of ""Acadia"" which stole the hearts of anyone who watched it. It was re-released on DVD but the quality wasn't that good. After wearing out my VCR tape, I bought the DVD and watched it probably once a month especially during the winter.  Acadia is a magical place and the original ""movie"" captured some of that magic with the outstanding video combined with the sometimes moving and sometimes dramatic music.  Having experienced so much of Acadia personally, the original movie was a reminder of what I'd seen.

I was fortunate to have scheduled a new trip there this September and, when checking for new Acadia releases, found that the movie had been redone using HD technology and with Perkins as, once again, the narrator.  I ordered it from Amazon in a heartbeat and watched it the day it arrived.

The new movie, recently released on both standard DVD and BluRay, is very much like the original.  It's dramatic photography and excellent historical photos make it a must-have to anyone thinking about visiting Acadia or for those who has already been there.  This new version does have more historical info which was appreciated.  What I found a bit disappointing, however, was the music. It just didn't have the same impact on me as the original movie.  Still, it's an excellent source of information and this movie will move new viewers to want to travel to Acadia, America's second most visited National Park and the only one on the eastern seaboard. It truly is a gift to the citizens of this great country.",1316649600,3,1847,4.6523076923076925
