994721,3,6305226199,I bought this movie really to try out a couple of the melodramatic Hollywood movies that came out in the 50s.  It definitely pulls that need off.  The simple thriller works both as a 'twist at the end' whodunnit and  as a stylish Hollywood piece.  But at the end it's just a quaint simple  movie.,961200000,,296,4.3090909090909095

994911,4,6305226199,"Anne Baxter, having received a Dear John letter from her serviceman boyfriend overseas, inadvertently answers a phone call from Raymond Burr (apparently he has quite a reputation with the ladies, although he is utterly miscast here) that was intended for Ann Sothern, asking Sothern for a date.  Desperate to heal her wounds from just having been jilted, Baxter plays along and goes in Sothern's place.  Burr (a sketch artist) is only slightly taken aback, happily plies Baxter with booze, and takes her back to his place, whereupon he makes advances to her and is killed with a poker.  But Baxter was so drunk that she has only the haziest recollection of this.  She hides from the police, but a reporter (Richard Conte) lures her out with a promise of help.  I won't give away the ending.  It's a solid film, directed by Fritz Lang, with Baxter's motivation in terms of not turning herself in seeming somewhat implausible.  As mentioned, Raymond Burr is miscast here as a real ladies' man, which hurts the film.  The highlight of the film is the interaction between the three women -- Baxter, Sothern and one other -- who share an apartment.  Their scenes have real flair.",1438300800,,1174,4.800995024875622

994915,4,6305226199,"Floating around Hollywood in rough script form in 1952, the story must have had many admirers. Norah Larkin (ultimately Anne Baxter), young, single and deeply in love, is dumped on her birthday via letter by her overseas GI boyfriend. Same evening, she's asked out by notorious womanizer Harry Prebble (Raymond Burr on screen), and in her emotionally shaky condition accepts. One nightclub cocktail leads to another, Harry's place, and some unwanted advances. Next thing you know, she's stumbling out into the rain minus her shoes. Next thing SHE knows, she's reading about Harry's murder in the following day's Chronicle. Seems he got dealt out using the same fireplace poker she'd been fending him off with.

What the heck happened? Drink fogs the memory, but what else can she or most anyone else think?  The L.A.P.D. hunts for a blonde of her description wearing her size shoes, and it seems just a matter of time before they close in. Ace newspaper columnist Casey Mayo (Richard Conte) offers his column as a mouthpiece in exchange for exclusive story rights.

Sounds slick, but some of the potential is lost on the transfer to screen. About half the reviews I've seen class this 1:28 film under the noir genre, then at its mid-forties/mid-fifties height. But if you look it up online anyplace, you'll see the term defined as a film style marked by its mood of pessimism, fatalism, and menace. And that last one is particularly lacking here. Burr's Harry is a menace to women certainly, but he spends most of the film lying in the morgue. George Reeves (the original Superman plus mustache) as police captain Sam Haynes could be pinching someone for shoplifting a carton of cigarettes for all the menace he exudes. Mayo doesn't appear self-serving and opportunistic enough to make the viewer edgy. And Norah's loyal roommates Crystal Carpenter/Ann Sothern and Sally Ellis/Jeff Donnell are supportive and trusting when they should be having more doubts about Norah's innocence, thus further adding to the suspense.

It probably all boils down to expectations; I anticipated something with more sock. As it stands, it's not a bad mystery and worth a look. It's always a pleasure too to see Nat ""King"" Cole perform, here with the title song. But don't expect to ever be jolted as you are in Hitchcock's '54 classic ""Rear Window"", in that moment when wife killer Raymond Burr stares out his apartment window toward the rooms of convalescent amateur detective Jimmy Stewart, and figures a few things out himself. THAT is menacing and noirish, and nothing comes close to matching it here.",1429142400,,2587,4.967667436489608

It's really hard to feel sorry for Anne Baxter, who thinks she killed someone while she was drunk, but only wants to hide it.  Richard Conte plays a dumb columnist, but George Reeves, whom I love to death as Superman, acts just like Clark Kent in his detective role (with a pencil mustache if I remember correctly).  Anne's roomies are even dumber than she is, however, it's hard to dislike Ann Sothern because she's so cool.  After all, she did get reincarnated as a 1928 Porter.  You can watch this if you want, but you will ask yourself, ""How could I have better spent that time?""  And the answer will be, ""doing anything else.""",1419811200,,730,4.451127819548872

Ya, I know, the dark ages.), but because there is a murder to be solved. His. Or rather the ne'er do well, rou, lady's man, whatever, character  he plays here, Harry Preeble, an artist with a very roving eye.

If there is a murder, then there must be a murderer, right, or in this case a murderess, and here hard-working, get ahead, and just jilted  Norah (played by Anne Baxter) is picture perfect for the frame, and the big house, women's side. See, she was old boy Harry's last known date, last know drunken date taken up to his apartment, from the wilds of the Blue Gardenia club, Chinese food, blue gardenias for the ladies,  and serious rum drinks a specialty, to see that old chestnut, his etchings. Yes, silly girl, especially with Harry's reputation. But birthday, jilted, and blue, flowers for your hair or not, would make any girl, hell, any human, a little out of sorts.

Out of sorts or not, Anne Baxter, who is reduced to sharing an apartment with two other fellow female workers (including one incredibly fierce chain-smoking Ann Sothern), is not going to take any fall for one little off night. And here is where hard-hitting reporter Casey at the press (played by Richard Conte) comes in to wrap things up, wrap them up so tight that even the police have to cry ""uncle,"" let her go, and go off in some corner and pout. That leaves only one thing. If Ann Baxter didn't do it, then who did? I am not telling. But think back a minute, old Harry had that roving eye and so the number of female suspects could have stretched around the block. It's too late for Mr. Harry, but remember that old saw about a woman scorned. Well don't say you were not warned.",1330214400,,1970,4.415977961432507

Also I played the disk on one of my other players and the playback was the same the Blue Gardenia DVD is the only disk that didn't play well, that said I got a full refund so no worries

Now about the film it's a great classic yeah it's a bit simple and predictable but still fun to watch in fact I can watch it over again and still enjoy it, the film stars Anne Baxter and mister Perry Mason himself Raymond Burr he's playing a womanizing playboy who gets killed with a fire poker, and there's a cameo with Nat King Cole he plays a lounge singer in fact he plays song of the films title and Anne is great in this film some of you might remember her most from her role in All About Eve, and the Ten Commandments, she was one of the great actresses of her time. sure the movie is lacking in some area's but still a lot of fun to watch definitely worth adding to your DVD collection and lets hope they put out a better DVD copy maybe a widescreen remastered one in the near future, oh by the way I already ordered a replacement copy of the film I hope it plays better then the last disk, last notes the DVD has only a scene selection feature and no other extras :(",1321833600,3,1479,3.9932432432432434

The cast is good.  Raymond Burr was quite effective as a slimey calendar artist.  Richard Conte was good as a man who had to deal with his growing interest in a woman who could have been a murderer.
Ann Baxter was also good as the young switchboard operator from Bakersfield, although she certainly didn't look like a hick in her black tafetta dress.  Ann Sothern was also good as her much more world savvy room mate.

After a woozy, drunken evening she somehow makes it home, waking up the next morning to find Prebble has been killed. Did she do it? Will she turn herself in? Will ace newspaper columnist Casey Mayo (Richard Conte) track her down before the police do?

This is hardly top-drawer Lang, and also hardly deserves to be called ""noir."" Little in the way of the look or feel of that genre inhabit this, one of the director's sunnier, more optimistic films; it's hard to imagine anyone thinking that the end here will be as tragic as that in some of his harder-bitten films. It might in fact call to mind one of his earlier American efforts, 1938's YOU AND ME - also a film with a serious subject presented in a somewhat ""light"" manner - with general success.  Lang's attempts at humor and lightness here though often fall flat or don't go anywhere: at first I thought that Norah's other roommate, Rose (Ruth Storey) would play some real part in the proceedings, murder-mystery addict that she is (rather like Pat Hitchcock in her father's STRANGERS ON A TRAIN) but that goes nowhere.

Still, after a halting first third, the story proceeds at a nice pace, and I can't find major fault with the actors, although Sothern needed more to do. It's an alright diversion.  Nat King Cole plays the title tune in the too-long restaurant scene near the beginning, and the LA feel of this mostly shot-on-sets piece is decent.

This spellbinding film noir gem, based on a story by Vera Caspary (best-remembered for ""Laura""), takes the audience on a mysterious murder case with lots of unexpected twists and turns.

When Norah Larkin (Anne Baxter) learns that her boyfriend overseas has become engaged to another woman, she drowns her sorrows at the Blue Gardenia club with notorious playboy Harry Prebble (Raymond Burr).  The following morning, Harry is discovered dead in his apartment, and Norah has no memory of what occurred in those few crucial hours.  Driven to the brink of near-hysteria, Norah begins to fear the worst as scandal-hungry newspapers start to fill their columns with stories of the ""Blue Gardenia"" murderess.  Could Norah have really killed Prebble?...

Anne Baxter leads a dream cast in THE BLUE GARDENIA which also boasts delightful Ann Sothern (""Lady in a Cage"") and Jeff Donnell (""In a Lonely Place"") as Norah's flatmates; Richard Conte as the newspaper reporter who just might provide the key to Norah's salvation, and the legendary Nat 'King' Cole in a cameo appearance, singing the haunting title song (composed by Bob Russell & Lester Lee).

THE BLUE GARDENIA is filled with the sickening paranoia which was so indicative of the times in which it was filmed.  Director Fritz Lang was one of the unfortunate targets of McCarthy's House Un-American Activities Committee; an anti-Communist witchhunt which ultimately (and needlessly) destroyed the lives of many actors, screenwriters and directors in the Hollywood community.  Lang used that same sense of paranoic dread in depicting the ordeal of Norah in the movie.

Richard Conte I found a bit annoying, and I couldn't believe, with all the street smarts his character had, he couldn't figure out that Anne was The Blue Gardenia.

In early 50s Hollywood, that's how Burr was cast. This was before the ""Perry Mason"" series made him so respectable.  The jerk gets Baxter drunk on exotic drinks and tries to put the moves on her.  To ward him off, she hits RB on the head with a poker-and passes out.  The next day, Burr is dead and guess who the main suspect is? Director Fritz Lang uses an old ploy: The audience suspects Baxter is innocent but Anne blacked out and doesn't know what she did!  The L.A. cops are looking only for a female murderess known as ""The Blue Gardenia"", named for the night club Burr took her.  An enterprising, oily reporter (Richard Conte) gets involved, looking only for a good headline and to sell papers.  He claims to be helping Baxter/the Gardenia but winds up getting her arrested! And then? And then Conte discovers a ""certain clue"", proving the good girl cannot be the Gardenia! BG winds down to an inevitable 1950s ""happy ending"".  That is the film's major weak point.  A second is the rushed resolution. It appears that Warner Brothers was determined to achieve a strict 90 minute run time. Yet a few more minutes at the end might have added some needed spice and tension. Silver and Ward's ""Film Noir"" opined that BG was shot in 50s b& w Television style, not the standard ""noir"" format.  Other amazon reviewers made the same observation, but this aspect is not fatal. Though it is not truly a noir release, BG is a perfectly decent murder mystery. It has an engaging and offbeat cast!

995221,4,6305226199,"I'm probably biased regarding this film as I love film noir and I love Fritz Lang. I have not yet been disappointed by any of his films! I do recommend this film to those of you who may have the same interests as me or for those who just want to see a well-made thriller of the 1950s.

Fritz Lang is probably best known for his ""German Expressionist"" films like Metropolis. It must not be forgotten, however, that he had a long and accomplished Hollywood career. The Blue Gardenia came at a time when Fritz Lang had already directed some great film noirs like Scarlet Street, Women in the Window and The Secret Beyond the Door and he was yet to make The Big Heat.

What makes The Blue Gardenia different from other film noirs, is perhaps the weight of the female characters. Although many film noirs have great female portrayals, like the phenomenal Norma Desmond in Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard, few make the women the lead characters and men only secondary characters. This is, however the case in The Blue Gardenia where we follow closely Norah's sufferings and her two housemates (also female). This adds a notion of feminism as we are horrified by Norah's destiny in the film and the accusations brought against her.

Of course, this film was made in 1953 at the end of the age of MacCarthyism. Fritz Lang himself suffered from suspicions of being communist friendly, but he was never charged or presented before HUAC. Instead he could not find work in Hollywood for a couple of years. In the film, we can catch the atmosphere or suspicion, untrustworthiness, hesitation and slander that was so clearly a part of the witch hunting in Hollywood and in the rest of the US. Can Norah really have committed murder? Who can she trust? Her friends? The journalist Casey Mayo? And is it alright to make accusations and create slanders publicly in a newspaper? These are just some of the questions one could ask once one has seen the film...

It may not be Fritz Lang's best film or the best Film Noir, but it's still worth seeing!",1140825600,6,2031,4.617728531855955
995292,3,6305226199,"""The Blue Gardenia"" is among director Fritz Lang's lesser films. It is often categorized as noir, but is only vaguely so. Adapted from the short story ""Gardenia"" by Very Caspary, it's more mystery/romance, like Caspary's ""Laura"", which made a far superior film. The cinematography by Nicholas Musuraca is in high-key style that was coming back into fashion in the 1950s, a major departure from the low-key lighting of the 1940s that became iconic of film noir. ""The Blue Gardenia"" looks an awful lot like 1950s television, which is alluded to in one bit of dialogue. It's placement during the Korean War and the plethora of post-war gender stereotypes also place this film firmly in the 1950s thematically. Ironically, Fritz Lang made ""The Big Heat"" the same year, which is solid film noir and perhaps his only truly great American film.

Norah Larkin (Anne Baxter) is a pretty, young switchboard operator with a boyfriend to whom she is devoted stationed in Korea. She cheerfully spends her evenings at home and never dates other men, wishing to remain faithful to her man overseas. But on her birthday, she learns that her boyfriend has fallen in love with another woman. Distraught, Norah impulsively accepts a dinner invitation from artist and infamous lothario Harry Prebble (Raymond Burr). She drinks too much and gets herself right snookered, a situation which Harry tries to take advantage of. Prebble is found dead in his apartment the next day, and Norah can't remember what happened. Confused and afraid, she responds to newspaperman Casey Mayo (Richard Conte) who, looking for an angle, promised his newspaper would provide the murderer with legal assistance in exchange for an exclusive story.

I found the most striking aspect  ""The Blue Gardenia"" to be how much it looks and feels like 1950s television. The concept of characters and gender relations had changed radically from the 1940s by the time this film was released in 1953. The men, exemplified in Harry Prebble and Casey Mayo, are conspicuously charming, egotistical, chauvinistic, predatory, and inexplicably irresistible to the ladies. The women are silly, chatty, and in need of rescuing. No one is interesting, and everyone is shallow. Add to that the cheesy ""Blue Gardenia"" restaurant , and the film is a little ridiculous. Nat King Cole performs ""The Blue Gardenia""'s thoroughly mediocre theme song in the restaurant scene.

The DVD (Image Entertainment 2005): This print has occasional specks and spots, but most of it is clean. There are no bonus features or subtitles.",1126051200,26,2551,5.125
995293,4,6305226199,"BLUE GARDENIA (1953) is Fritz Lang's first film after appearing before the House Un-American Activities Committee after somebody, somehow convinced someone that he was not now and never had been a communist.  BLUE GARDENIA is a particularly venomous indictment of mid-20th century America.

  Or something like that.  Peter Bogdanovich, director, says so on the dvd jacket back cover. I suppose if you're studying up for the essay question the phrase `scathing attack' is another one to keep in mind. Lang, if biographers can be trusted, held no great affection for a movie he had little hand in creating and one he shot in about three weeks time.  Even the title indicates more commercial exploitation than artistic inspiration was at work here. The film's producer wanted to capitalize on the notorious murder in 1947of a prostitute who the press referred to as the `Black Dahlia' and built a story around a name. Heck, I thought it was an interesting, well-lit story of crime and punishment, better than most but not one that took ones breath away or left a lot of blood on the floor.  Sometimes, even when made by the best of directors, films are just movies.

  In any event, BLUE GARDENIA is about a good girl Norah Larkin (Ann Baxter) who gets a little too drunk one broken-hearted evening, accepts an invite from brutish playboy Harry Prebble (Raymond Burr.)  They go to the Blue Gardenia nightclub where Nat King Cole sings the show (and momentum) stopping title song.  Prebble plies pretty Norah with a few dozen Polynesian Pearl Divers and soon has her checking out his sketches at his apartment.  By now Norah is deep in her cups and Burr makes his move.  The movies leaves it a little unclear at this point but Norah soon flees the apartment, leaving her shoes, a lace handkerchief and an inanimate rogue in the strange apartment.

  Norah takes it on the lam and cynical columnist Casey ""Sudden death sells papers, son"" Mayo (Richard Conte) writes an open letter to the Blue Gardenia, his attention-getting name for the hiding murderess.  I think it's the Casey Mayo character who inspired the `scathing venom' comments.  Norah can't, won't, go to the police and Mayo plays sympathetic solely to get an exclusive interview with the suspect.

  Although I believe Lang didn't have as much involvement with this movie as he did with most of his masterpieces, there are enjoyable Langian touches sprinkled throughout.  Norah is one of his ambiguously evil characters.  The movie leads us to believe she's committed a deed most foul, but it frames it as an act of self-defense rather that violence.  In fact, Norah is one of the most innocent of characters you can imagine in a crime thriller.  Unfortunately for the movie a new character is preposterously introduced in the last ten minutes or so that quiets whatever questions we had about Norah's fawn-like innocence.  It's a cop-out that undermines the whole movie.

  BLUE GARDENIA may not be a classic crime thriller, but I liked it quite a bit.  If you're a film noir fan and come in with high expectations you might be disappointed.",1111017600,8,3100,4.858778625954199

995296,5,6305226199,"""I was really mad,"" director Fritz Lang conceded relative to his work on ""The Blue Gardenia.""  Lang, one of the numerous talented German emigrees escaping Hitler's Germany, a group also consisting of Billy Wilder, Robert Siodmak and Max Reinhardt, had been offered the position of the head of filmmaking for the Third Reich's Propaganda Ministry by none other than Joseph Goebbels.  Lang, who loathed what the Third Reich stood for, believed the offer was no more than a trap and his days were numbered if he stayed in Berlin.  That same night he made his escape to Paris, after which he came to America and found a position in Hollywood making films.
Thoroughly fed up with thought control and the imprisonment of ideas, and all too subsequently people as well, Lang was furious over the Cold War response to the new challenge of the Soviet Union, that of McCarthyism and its sorry influence over the film industry with the blacklist period highlighted by the imprisonment of the Hollywood Ten for refusing to name names to the House Un-American Activities Committee.
The term that civil libertarians of the period used was ""guilt by association"" and, in his creative anger, this was the story thrust of ""The Blue Gardenia.""  Charles Hoffman's screenplay focused tightly on the tragic experience of one lovely and vulnerable young woman, Anne Baxter, who, as a result of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, becomes the subject of a city wide media blitz and corresponding woman hunt which blankets Los Angeles and leaves her terrified and appropriately paranoiac.
Baxter's journey into hell begins one evening after opening a letter from the man she loves in her apartment on her birthday.  Her roommates Ann Sothern and Jeff Donnell are both gone and Baxter milks the occasion for romance, pouring herself a champagne toast and playing soft music as she reads what she believes will be a romantic letter from the man she hopes to marry, who is serving in the military in Korea during that conflict.  They have been sweethearts since high school in Bakersfield, where they grew up some 100 miles from L.A.  Instead of receiving a romantic letter she tearfully reads about him finding love with the nurse he met when he was hospitalized from a war injury, the woman he now intends to marry.
Caught in a vulnerable state, Baxter then receives a call from wolfish artist Raymond Burr, who was attempting to reach her roommate Sothern.  Burr has an office near the main switchboard room of the telephone company, where Baxter and her roommates work as operators.  Feeling crushed, she agrees to meet Burr and have dinner with him at The Blue Gardenia, a Hollywood restaurant-nightclub, where she listens to Nat ""King"" Cole's romantic rendering of the film's title song.  Burr gets her drunk on exotic Polynesian drinks, then drives her to his apartment.
When Burr lives up to his reputation by coming on fast, Baxter resists.  She then passes out, waking up and finding her highly romantic host lying on the rug.  She quickly exits, walking home barefoot in the rain.
Richard Conte, a shrewd, ambitious newspaper columnist, surfaces on the scene next.  When Burr, whose reputation definitely preceded him, is found dead in his apartment, the opportunity surfaces for regular headlines and the sale of an endless stream of newspapers.  Since Baxter had been seen with Burr at nightclub, where she was provided with a free blue gardenia as befitting the establishment's custom, Conte uses the catchy name in his stories as the woman hunt heats up.
Unable to remember what happened in her conflict with Burr, a frightened Baxter burns her potentially incriminating dress which she wore that night in the trash.  A police officer happens by but she barely gets away with her deed.  Another time the former husband of Ann Sothern, a practical joker, causes her to hang up the telephone in fright when he calls and asks, ""Is this the Blue Gardenia?""
Eventually Baxter, who is presumed guilty in the rush to judgment media style, reminiscent of McCarthy Era guilt by association, takes advantage of an offer by Conte sent via his column to meet him in private.  He offers to be helpful and see that she receives fair treatment by the police.  Instead the wily lieutenant heading the case's task force, played by George Reeves of the ""Superman"" television series, apprehends Baxter at the fast food restaurant near the newspaper where she has gone to meet Conte.  Baxter believes she has been deceived by a reporter for whom she was developing a rapid romantic crush.  Conte insists that Reeves is the culprit and he never deceived her.
Eventually the wily Conte cracks the case, feeling guilty over launching the Blue Gardenia frenzy.  A nifty twist at film's end reveals the identity of the actual killer after bulldog reporter Conte follows up successfully on a clue.

Anne Baxter thinks she has killed Raymond Burr, the police knows she has killed him because a lot of evidences have been found on the scene of the murder and we know that she's guilty because we have seen the scene with our very eyes. So what ? Where's the suspense ? Nowhere, because there isn't suspense in THE BLUE GARDENIA. Fritz Lang is more interested in describing the behaviour of Anne Baxter who really doesn't act as if she doesn't want to be rediscovered.

1) ""The Blue Dahlia"" was released on April 19, 1946.
2) Elizabeth Short's body was found nine months later, on January 15, 1947.  It is most commonly believed that she was nicknamed the ""Black Dahlia"" by a sensationalistic press looking for a catchy nickname.  It is probably a reference to both the Veronica Lake film, and the fact that Beth had a fondness for black clothing.
3) This film, ""The Blue Gardenia"" was not released until 1953, and really has nothing overtly to do with the notorious unsolved murder of Beth Short.  However, I CAN see where the filmmakers may have slightly exploited the fact that the Black Dahlia had seeped well into America's collective unconscious by then.

7885740,1,6305226199,"Am I the one that didn't miss the fact that there was no broken mirror at the end of the film when the lady killer ended her story? IE: the hearth mirror was broken by the killer at the beginning of the movie! But, as the real killer is confessing her story, they show he picking up the poker where Raymond Burr left it, then she picked it up and whacked him with it, then dropped the poker near the entryway; not in front of the fireplace. In first part of the film, the killer first broke the mirror, then hit him over the head with the poker, killing him. Ridiculous.

Now let's go backward. If that weren't bad enough for a one star rating, the acting by everyone was just plain 'soap opera' bad. Ann Baxter, Raymond Burr etc. Two hours of painfully slow nothingness. And in the end...NO BROKEN MIRROR. It just disappeared from the story. Unless Baxter just dreamed it all up. But if that were the case, they gave no indication of it. As if the audience was completely stupid. I love film noir but unfortunately for me, this is now the worst of it's category. I'f give it a zero if I could.",1491350400,,1094,4.259615384615385
7885741,4,6305226199,"""The Blue Gardenia"" is made remarkable among the noir genre by its strong assertion of a female perspective.  ""Sisterhood is powerful"", and in this film we are given three young female roommates who not only look remarkably similar, but are remarkable supportive of each other.

Anne Baxter gives the central performance as the rejected lover whose vulnerability is preyed upon by an artist/womanizer played by Raymond Burr.  In the classic fashion, he attempts a seduction by getting the object of his desire drunk ( on ""Polynesian Pearl Divers"") and offering false sympathy in his cozy lair afterwards.  This movie is pretty cynical in its portrayal of men, who are all shown as cads who keep and trade ""little black books"".  Not even George Reeves (later to portray Superman in the first tv series) is excepted-- he is depicted as a square-jawed poseur.

Only Richard Conte, excellent as a newspaperman who writes an open letter to the suspected killer, is given any redemptive qualities.

This was the first of three movies directed by Fritz Lang to feature prominent roles for newspapermen.  Lang softened this movie by deferring to melodramatic aspects, and incorporating musical themes.  ""Blue Gardenia"", actually sung in the nightclub by Nat King Cole, becomes the theme for Anne Baxter's heroine.  The other theme, ""Prelude and Love/Death"" by Richard Wagner, becomes the mystery theme for the actual murder.

This isn't the greatest of noir movies, but it does have a very sympathetic heroine in Anne Baxter (there is no 'femme fatale' reveal until the very end).  There are also some great moments of nostalgia, as when Baxter's character switches on a stovetop light in a kitchen scene... an indelible use of a vintage appliance.
