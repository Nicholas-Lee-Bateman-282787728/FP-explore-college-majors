8002096,4,B0000E6EL1,"An amazing lead performance, terrific, strong, stylistic lighting and camerawork, and good supporting performances highlight this true story of a violent, sad, sexy, gay Brazilian pimp and drag queen performer in the 1930s, and his two housemates/earners - one male and one female.  Touching, complex, never dull. but somehow doesn't quite add up to as much as it seems like it should.  It spends so much time on some elements of 'Madame Sata's story, that it speeds by and glosses over other key moments, especially the ending. None-the less, very worth seeing for all that's good about it, and forgivable for it's flaws.",1274918400,,622,5.029126213592233
8002097,3,B0000E6EL1,"AS the FILM IS INTERESTING REMEMBERING A HCHO THAT HAS SUCCEEDED DOES MANY Years AT A TOWN OF BRAZIL
A FILM THAN IN HIS EPOCH HE HAS CAUSED MANY REMARKS",1187308800,,152,4.1
8002098,4,B0000E6EL1,"This is a fascinating, extremely well done, documentary style Indie film about the life of a down and out guy who defies narrow definitions.

  The story description focuses on the most outr elements of this man's life:  Brazillian pimp, street fighter, drag queen, thief, criminal.

  The outstanding achievement of this film, though, is to put his life into context, that he is also protector, father, dreamer, artist; but does not airbrush, glamorize nor excuse his life.

  This film goes further to put his life into context in the racial mix of Brazil of the 1930s, when slaves were freed but not allowed to hold jobs, the Brazil of Carnival where even the most macho men appear in drag.  Deftly touching on all, but not belaboring any one of these elements of bigotry and systemic injustices, we are given a real portrait of an unusual family who are revealed in their entirety, rarely good, not entirely bad, really human.

  The performances of the main four characters are simply outstanding and raw, so much so that you begin to wonder if this really IS a documentary.  The small supporting roles are all equally strong.  A riveting film in all respects; here the art direction and filming styles really augment the gritty reality and emotional perspective of an edgy life in a difficult time and place.

  This is a morally complex film, not for children at all, not for those who do not like indie films.  If you rent it, DEFINITELY listen to the commentary, the Director DOES achieve what he hopes to convey.  This is not a film you ""love"" - it is one that deserves deep respect.",1166918400,,1593,4.699275362318841
8002099,3,B0000E6EL1,"Right away,

I'll admit that this is a really good movie, per se. It is a real-life depiction of Joo Francisco dos Santos, a man with a complex, troubled life in 1930's Brazil. In spite of being a con-artist, thief, prostitute/pimp, and all-round angry person, Joao is also, believe it or not, a caring individual who displays acts of good in quieter, but no less extraordinary, ways.  Throughout his life, he is often misunderstood and he struggles to balance the two extremes of his personality.

My only complaint is that this movie is a meager representation of Joo Francisco dos Santos' life. We are introduced to only a very short time period of his life; probably not more than a year out of his life of 76 years. We learn more about him from reading the product description than we would ever have known by watching the film alone.  We see nothing about his early life nor any references that may have helped us to understand his actions better. We are told that he spent much time in prison (""26 of his 76 years"" on earth) but we view one arrest.  We are told told that he adopted 7 children, but we only see one.  We are told that he was a consumate cabaret/drag performer, but we only see one performance and his beginnings as an ""understudy.""  We are told, at the end of the film, about his many successes in the famed Brazilian Samba Carnivals, but, in regards, we only view a single slow motion, abstract monologue at the end as a wrap-up. In fact, the title ""Madame Sata"" is only used once, right before closing credits to tell us what he did in later life. We never actually see Madame Sata!

Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed; not with the movie but with the way it was presented. If one had no previous knowledge about Dos Santos or had not read the movie description, the viewer would be cheated about knowing the life of a truly remarkable human being.  I felt that there was so much more than could have been included in the movie.

However, I enjoyed the movie, as it was. The lead actor is incredible and I've enjoyed seeing him in Carandiru and City of God, two other great Brazilian, real-life movies.

Be aware,
reviews and the DVD cover are going to set you up for viewing the story of an incredibly complex and interesting man, but you're actually going to experience about a third of his life.
It's almost like being served a filet mignon for hors d'ouevres, and then bread and water for the main course. Sadly, the plot synopsis offers more than the movie delivers.",1154908800,,2507,4.5
8002100,5,B0000E6EL1,"I thought the movie was great.  The lead actor is very handsome and I thought he did a wonderul job.  I have read the other reviews and yes he is rude and mean, but has a soft side because no matter what he always took care of his extended family.  Taboo was timid and I was not suprised by the way Joao treated him.  Laurita as well seemed to be in love with Joao even though she new of his life style.  She always showed him compassion like a wife would a husband.  I thought the movie was great I wish we new more about his child hood and how he really looked.  It's a must see!",1141344000,,581,3.9145299145299144
8002101,4,B0000E6EL1,"Madame Sat reminds me a bit of the Marquis de Sade in his daring and open sexuality and steadfastness to what he believes in. And like Sade, he triumphs in the wake of adversity and does what he wants in spite of what others may think.
This film is visually and emotionally gripping. A very dark and furious picture of the 1930s bohemian/lower class sector of Rio de Janero. Even though the movie never focuses on the main character's life as Madame Sat (which occurs later in his life) it chooses instead to tell the story of his rise to that point and the hardships he faced (and those around him) as he tried to reach his goal under opressive odds. Some may be turned off by the homosexual element but I believe it's simply an accurate portrayal of the lives of some men during that time and what they had to do to get by.
The passion with which Lzaro Ramos performances belies his young 22 years (in the making of featurette he even admits to going through things in the movie he had never dealt with before, simply because he is so young). Even the supporting cast of little known actors and actresses do a wonderful job of making the time and the place all the more believable.
If you love challenging films, indie films or films about underground legends, then I would definately recommend this to you.",1079481600,16,1309,4.458333333333333
