8502714,5,B000TGWQKM,"Drexell's Class was a short-lived sitcom with Dabney Coleman that was actually very funny.  Coleman plays a selfish scoundrel who happens to be a grade-school teacher. I remember the opening scene where he's grading papers and somebody clips ten bucks onto his paper and Coleman instantly gives him an A+. Although still a formulaic sitcom, Coleman proves he has the comedic chops in this show. It originally aired on Fox for maybe two seasons and was cut.  I would love to see it on DVD.",1251936000,6,488,4.729411764705882
