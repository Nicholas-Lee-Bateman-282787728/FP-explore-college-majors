8325946,5,B000YI7BRI,"One of my favorite movies is Vittorio de Sica's Academy Award-winning masterpiece, The Garden of the Finzi-Continis, based on a novel by Giorgio Bassani about the persecution and ultimately extermination of Jews from Ferrara, Italy, during the days when fascists under Mussolini were adapting anti-Jewish Nazi laws. I finally got around to reading Bassani's novel that inspired this film and learned more about the author as well.

Prior to the Finzi-Continis, Bassani had written a novel called The Gold-Rimmed Spectacles (Gli occhiali d'oro), In 1987, it was made into an Italian movie starring Philippe Noiret, Rupert Everett, and Valeria Golino, and directed by Giuliano Montaldo.

An elderly doctor, Athos Fadigati (Noiret), has kept his sexual orientation a secret in his small town until he falls in love with a younger man, a would-be boxer name Eraldo, a gay-for-pay young thug who doesn't care how much he abuses his benefactor or destroys the older man's reputation.

As scandal spreads, the doctor is befriended by a young Jewish student, Davide Lattes (Everett), who has his own amorous problems with Nora Treves (Golino), a beautiful Jewish girl whose cowardliness causes her to betray Davide in favor of a young fascist.

As with The Garden of the Finzi-Continis, the right-wing bigotry and persecution builds, layer upon layer, until tragedy strikes.

The film features a prize-winning musical score by famed composer Ennio Morricone.",1404777600,,1450,5.342105263157895
