We enjoy watching old tv shows and this one was really good.
He enjoyed watching Groucho and laughs at this no matter how many times he's already seen it!
Life was certainly tamer back them, we loved it!",1273190400,2,254,4.1

Ultimate Groucho Marx: You Bet Your Life, Collection - The Best Episodes : Volume 2.  A great deal for all that Groucho entertainment!",1252800000,2,239,4.511627906976744
8285101,2,B001BXL1R6,"I love Groucho but this particular recording is not up to the quality of the other DVD's of Groucho's shows. It's jumpy and jerky while playing, which is a great distraction.",1229731200,6,174,4.645161290322581
