7950484,5,B00005QFE7,"This collection of four films are all decent romantic comedies with two stand-outs: My Best Friends Wedding and As Good As It Gets. Not much of a story in Sleepless In Seattle but thanks to Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks it keeps your interest through to the end. The Wedding Planner I had not seen prior to this; it is the weakest of the four films but worth watching. A very good buy at less than ten dollars a film. No real clunkers in this set.

I spent a pleasant weekend re-visiting these films, fun to see them again.",1343779200,,516,4.212121212121212
