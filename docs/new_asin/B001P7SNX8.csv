3740702,4,B001P7SNX8,I enjoy her DVDs!  and I agree with her that if you keep your spine supple you will live a healthier longer life.,1291075200,2,113,3.9130434782608696
3740703,5,B001P7SNX8,"When i discovered Maya Fiennes i couldn't believe my luck! This DVD, as all of her others i've experienced, is truly a spiritual work of art. There is a feeling of passion and integrity in the process and it invites your trust and surrender to a very deep, even primal connection to your body. The session inspires a reverence for the wholeness of being and you can't help but feel that something profoundly good is happening to every part of yourself! More than a physical workout, her whole series for the chakras is an experience that literally ignites your living energy. It looks simple and sometimes it's easy to think that it cannot be enough, yet every time you return to a meditation pose and certainly at the end of the session, your whole body is buzzing renewed and awakened. I cannot think of any better health recommendation! Not only it puts you back into your body, but it does so in the most reverent, pleasurable and empowering way. Enjoy!",1282608000,40,957,4.635294117647059
3740714,5,B001P7SNX8,"AWESOME HEALTH BENEFIT!!!

3740715,5,B001P7SNX8,"Easy to follow, even for a beginner.  A great workout and a wonderful way to burn calories.  I love the white on white they use in the production of this DVD, helps you focus on the yoga and being centered.  I'd recommend it to anyone.",1370131200,,235,4.177777777777778

3740720,3,B001P7SNX8,I thought this was a music cd when I ordered it (should have taken more time to read the description) but the DVD did not disappoint.,1355875200,,133,4.153846153846154
3740721,5,B001P7SNX8,I have only done the love portion so far but it is very uplifting. Maya is a very good teacher.,1349654400,,95,3.8
3740722,5,B001P7SNX8,"I practice Kundalini Yoga everyday and started out with Ana and Ravi's DVDs which I love, but I am always looking for something new and decided to purchase some of Maya Fiennes.  I have to say that they are wonderfully spiritual DVDs that give you both a great practice and an excellent meditation to start your day with.  I also have her Courage, Creativity, and Willpower DVDs and the Detox and Destress
one as well, and I would recommend them to anyone, beginners thru advanced.",1331078400,2,481,4.647058823529412
3740723,5,B001P7SNX8,I have tried a few other Kundalini Yoga DVDs but by far Maya's are the best.  She gives you a step by step guide thru the Chakras and demonstrates all the mantras as well.  I actually tried to do the Mantras without guidance and found I was doing my meditations all wrong.  Thank you Maya for having the insight to produce these DVDs and your CD's which I just ordered here on Amazon yesterday.  Now I will be able to listen to the mantras and do my meditations as I go about my day....,1327449600,3,486,4.138297872340425
3740744,3,B001P7SNX8,"I love Maya Fiennes dvd's. I have all of them. They are great but one dvd (Truth) skips the last 15 minutes. That is frustrating in itself, but it happens toward the end when you go into meditation. By the time you are finished trying to get it to play, you have completely come out of the state you were in - and it may/may not play. Other than that - all of the videos are great. I would give them all 5 stars. I gave this 3 b/c of the technical difficulties. It would be nice if replacements were offered - it seems most of us have this problem with the Truth DVD.",1326153600,7,567,3.982456140350877
3740745,3,B001P7SNX8,"I purchased my first Maya Fiennes DVD, Detox and Destress and loved it. The DVD for the throat chakra in this set however has a problem and it skips the last 15 minutes and jumps directly to the credits. I am able to play around with the remote control on my DVD player and get it to finally play those lost minutes but it such a hassle it isn't worth my time. It is too bad, because otherwise I love the routine. Unfortunately I hadn't even noticed that lost 15 minutes until a friend brought it to my attention and at that time I figured it was too late to do anything about asking for  a replacement. The other DVD in the set plays just fine.",1316822400,2,645,4.119047619047619
3740746,5,B001P7SNX8,"I'm new to Yoga in general and I found this DVD easy to follow, with an amazing yoga experience in the privacy of my own home.",1316736000,3,126,3.8846153846153846
3740747,5,B001P7SNX8,"Stumbled upon this on a T.V. health program.....Its great to just de-stress to.....Maya is calming ,... so is the music, and I love all the breathing. It just makes you feel better,, without tremendous effort.... Yoga to really enjoy.....Thumbs up",1308441600,4,247,5.2
3740748,5,B001P7SNX8,"The entire Journey Through the Chakras is tremendously rewarding and worth purchasing.  The Love and Truth series focus on opening the heart center (love and openness, letting go of resentment) and the throat center (thyroid, speaking the truth, speaking out tactfully).  Both have elevated my comfort in my own skin, and my energy.  I did a 40 series of Truth in hopes of boosting a sluggish thyroid and found myself with an unexpected benefit - a stronger ability to speak out and articulate myself - I have always been an avoider of confrontations!  I must note that there was a problem with the Truth Disc - mine never played the final 15 minutes.  I contacted mayaspace.com and after a bit of back and forth, they sent me a disc to replace mine for free.

Finally, I was fortunate enough to attend a workshop with Maya this weekend.  She was lovely, approachable and had a tremendous presence.  She is a wonderful healer and teacher and a gift to those who have added her discs to their practice!",1304294400,36,1001,4.6477272727272725
3740749,3,B001P7SNX8,"I have most of Maya's DVD. This has elements of her Detox and Destress (the best ever). Perhaps if you didn't have more than two of her DVD's this wouldn't be an overkill. She's in the same outfits, same setting and same music. The quality is not as good as the detox video. Choppier and sloppier. However, it is an effective routine.",1299974400,6,334,4.403225806451613
3740750,5,B001P7SNX8,"Need I say more - you won't be disappointed - it is as if the yoga does all the ""hard work"" for you...don't be hesitant because of other reviews saying you need to be in shape - unless you are really out of shape!!!",1297468800,,215,3.909090909090909
3740751,5,B001P7SNX8,"I've always hated yoga.  Maya gave me a new perspective on yoga.  Not only do I feel good, but better spiritually connected.  Thanks Maya!  Please do more cuz I've bought them all now. :)",1296950400,,187,4.411764705882353

3740753,5,B001P7SNX8,I love Maya's yoga videos.  I now have every single one.  This set is my favorite.  I love the consistent format of all of them.  Some are harder than others.  These two are fairly easy but also extremely soothing and uplifting.,1293926400,13,228,4.463414634146342

8332356,3,B001P7SNX8,"Maya is a great teacher, however this addition was okay quality wise and missing a resting period at the end of the session. Shavasana is such an essential closing of all practices in yoga that I'm surprised its not included. I would highly recommend her Kundalini Yoga to detox and de-stress DVD instead as it feels like a more well rounded practice as a whole.",1480896000,,362,4.584615384615384

8332358,5,B001P7SNX8,"It took a while for me to take to Maya, initially I gravitated more toward Ana & Ravi Singh but as my Kundalini practice has grown I've come to really appreciate Maya Fiennes, I would encourage anyone drawn toward kundalini to invest in this set of dvd's, money well spent, and a big thanks to Maya Fiennes for sharing her wisdom!",1459987200,,330,4.426229508196721
