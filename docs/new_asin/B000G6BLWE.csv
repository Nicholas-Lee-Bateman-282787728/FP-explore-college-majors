2600581,4,B000G6BLWE,"I love Young Frankenstein. However, I was very disappointed when I realized that this re-release of it only had ""mono"" audio tracks.  This is very disappointing because I would have loved to hear it in Dolby Surround. I am actually rather confused as to why they re-released it, because it has the exact same content as the previous DVD release... possibly a marketing ploy, I dunno.  Let me also make clear that THE MOVIE IS A 5 STAR MOVIE BUT THE RE-RELEASE WAS THE REASON FOR THE 4 STAR RATING. Basicly, if you already have the ""Special Edition"" (earlier DVD release) you may as well save your money; they're exactly the same. However, if you have never seen this movie, I suggest you do yourself a favor and buy this movie. Definately won't disappoint fans of comedy.",1158192000,,771,4.62043795620438

I have a large blu ray collection and tons of other movies play on this unit, but have had a few movies that will not play and therefore have had to return them.

All of the extras would play fine. But the movie would not, jumping to a specific scene would not. Same at the other movies that would not play, once an attempt is made to play the movie (or any part of it), the unit locks up. I have to unplug power from the DVD player, power it back up and open the door to get it out. Have not figured out the pattern but some blu ray discs have some feature/format that makes them unplayable on some players. (The player is up to date with latest firmware, so it's not that.)

2600658,5,B000G6BLWE,"OK Ted this is one movie you'll never get your color on.
This is proof that some life changing movies need to be in Black and white. Color can some time distract from the message.

This film went out of its way to highlight the important parts of the original message and the acting is impeccable.

Young Frankenstein is a tightly written spoof on the series of Hollywood Frankenstein movie sequels. The son of a famous dabbler in the mysteries of life gets intrigued in the craft himself finding it necessary to exchange attributes with his creation.

One of the people in this film that I am keeping a collection of is Teri Garr, ""Star Trek"" (1966) playing ""Roberta Lincoln""(as Terry Garr) in episode: ""Assignment: Earth"" (episode # 2.26) 3/29/1968. And there is so much of her in this film as Inga. I like the part where the doctor comments on the castle doorknockers and Inga thanks him for the compliment. I was relieved to find the DVD did not say that they were special affects.

And true to the originals, after throwing everything insight into the water, the little girl asks what is left to throw in? The monster (Peter Boyle) just looks out at you knowing the answer.",1501113600,,1178,4.595238095238095

This is one hilarious spoof on the Frankenstein horror movies that will keep you laughing no matter how many times you watch it.

Or when Gene Wilder lifts Teri Garr out of the Hay Wagon and Marty Feldmen hits the huge door knockers on the castle and Gene Wilder exclaims ""What Knockers"" and Teri Garr giggles and says ""Why Thank you"", or every time Cloris Leachman is addressed as frau Bloecher,l the horses whinney.",1483315200,,816,4.397350993377484

2600865,4,B000G6BLWE,"Released in 1974 and directed/written by Mel Brooks (co-written by Gene Wilder), Young Frankenstein is a B&W horror parody of classic Universal monster flicks starring Wilder in the eponymous role of Baron Frankensteins grandson in modern times (the early 70s, that is). He travels to Transylvania after inheriting his grandfathers creepy castle and re-starts his mad experiments with the help of a hunchback (Marty Feldman), a hot lab assistant (Teri Garr) and a housekeeper (Cloris Leachman). Peter Boyle plays the Monster, Kenneth Mars the inspector and Madeline Kahn Frankensteins fianc.

While there are a few laugh-out-loud sequences (the best being the one with the seesaw), the movies mostly quietly amusing. Similar horror parodies had been done before, like Roman Polanskis The Fearless Vampire Killers (1967) and The Vampire Happening (1971), but Young Frankenstein is just all-around better, mainly because of the outstanding cast. Teri Garr is fun and fetching.

The movie runs 106 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area.

Sure, it's camp but not campy (except for Marty Feldman who is terrific as the audience's surrogate).  The cast shows restraint by not going over the top and is funnier for it.  Frau Blucher could have been a throwaway character but the reaction from the horses and her pained expression is perhaps the most mimicked part from the film.  Gene Wilder is at his best from beginning to end and when he grandly re-pronounces his name I'm torn between laughter and cheers!",1477440000,,588,4.561904761904762

Gene Wilder's passing reminded me of this movie and I decided to share it with my kids.  When I couldn't find it streaming on any of the movie services we have access to, and I noticed it for sale at a VERY low price here on Amazon, I decided to add this one to our collection.

We showed this as a ""movie night"" along with another family.  It's always funny to see where different generations will laugh at different parts.  We even had to back up a few times to hear some of the dialogue due to all the laughter from the kids.

There is some sexually suggestive content that may be questionable for our 10-13 year old audience, but not as bad as what they've seen in the blockbuster movies of today.

2600941,5,B000G6BLWE,"Young Frankenstein is a fun spoof loosely based on Mary Shelley's Frankenstein story.  It is in the style of the old black and white horror movies which helps to set the mood for what's to come.  After distancing himself from the work of his infamous grandfather, Dr. Frederick Frankenstein ends up in Transylvania and is forced to come to terms with his family's legacy.

My husband is a huge fan of Mel Brooks' movies and has most of them on dvd.  This was somehow missing from my hubby's collection and after hearing him reference jokes and lines from the movie (many times-lol) it was about time to get him this dvd.  It was well worth it!

You can expect goofy humour of the type that appeals to teenage boys (or grown men)!  At times it was a bit slow and predictable but that was offset by the genius of the actors.  Gene Wilder was fantastic - we shall all mourn his recent passing.  He played Dr. Frankenstein's American grandson.  He really looked the part of a glamorous black and white film star.  Peter Boyle (of Raymond fame) was great as the monster.  Madeline Kahn, Cloris Leachman and Teri Garr were the leading ladies.  The scene stealer for me was Marty Feldman as Igor. Those eyes!  His facial expressions alone caused uproarious laughter.

At 106 minutes this comedy is a comfortable length.  The rating is PG.  I would recommend this movie for a fun date night or family movie night.  Add popcorn, kick back and enjoy!

This movie is the gem in Wilder's Filmography. Sure, we know about his adventures with Charlie, and that movie is a classic, too, but it didn't showcase Gene Wilder's brilliance the way Young Frankenstein does. About 10 percent of the movie quotes I inject into common conversations come from this movie. I always have something to say when someone is complaining about how bad things are.

2600968,5,B000G6BLWE,"This 1976 comedy by Mel Brooks has lost nothing over the years in terms of its ability to entertain.  It is an hilarious send up of the classic horror movies ""Frankenstein"" and ""The Bride of Frankenstein"", but puts its own twist on the stories.  The sets were borrowed from the original movies, while the black and white presentation recreates the mood of the earlier movies.  Gene Wilder is priceless as young Doctor Frankenstein, lured back to Transylvania to claim an inheritance from his father, which turns out to be the secret of creating another Frankenstein (well-played by Peter Boyle).  Dr. Frankenstein will be assisted by his father's lab assistant Igor (Marty Feldman) and the beautiful Inga (Terri Gar), but the movie is full of cameos of then prominent actors.  If you think you know where this movie is going, you don't!  Come along for the laughs.  Highly recommended and worth another look with the passing of Gene Wilder.",1472688000,,940,4.9113924050632916

2600983,5,B000G6BLWE,what a classic,1470355200,,14,4.0
2600984,5,B000G6BLWE,"Dr. Frederick Frankenstein lectures his American medical students on the body's nervous system. He is a man of science, totally divorcing himself from his grandfather Victor's infamous reanimation experiments, even changing his name's pronunciation to FRONK en steen. He tells his students, ""My grandfather was a very sick man.""

But that's before he finds out he inherited his grandfather's Transylvania castle. And library. And laboratory. Then he has a full change of heart.

That little synopsis gives no clue to how ""Young Frankenstein"" is a perfect comedy. Everything comes together in a beautiful package. The actors are superb, especially Gene Wilder. But you can't ignore any of the performances. I had no clue until years after seeing it in the theater that Gene Hackman was in the film.

The dialogue and physical bits are very funny. And when they work together, as they so often do in this film, it is hilarious. Did you know that Igor's hump changing sides started off as Marty Feldman's joke? He switched it right and left waiting to see if anybody was going to notice.  And I always guffaw at Chloris Leachman's Frau Blucher (neeeigh!) declaring, ""YES! He vas my boyfriend!""

One of my favorite scenes is when Frederick aims to show the success of his reanimation by impressing a black-tie audience at the Bucharest Academy of Science. He and the Monster sing and dance their way through a rendition of ""Puttin' on the Ritz."" I dare you to watch it and not grin.

""Young Frankenstein"" hit the theaters in December 1974. The screenplay was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

This is my very favorite Mel Brooks movie, though I admit not being impressed with some of them. Brooks directed twelve films in all, acting in all but one. That one was ""Young Frankenstein"". This was at creator and co-writer Gene Wilder's insistence, because he felt too often that Mel ""broke the fourth wall"" when he acted. That is, he spoke or referred directly to the audience, and Wilder didn't want that in ""Young Frankenstein.""

Eight of Mel Brooks movies, including ""Young Frankenstein,"" are collected in a slipcase in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mel-Brooks-Bx-Sm-Cb/dp/B000EBIONA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mel Brooks Bx Sm Cb</a>.

2601037,5,B000G6BLWE,"Firstly, Deb in MI, even though you wrote your review six years or so ago and if nobody's told you, Young Frankenstein was intentionally shot in black & white to capture the old-era feeling of the original Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein. It should and hopefully will never be available in color. The color that is referred to on the disc has to do with the special features, I'm sure.
To Alric the Red: Iwhile I do agree with you that the quality of the video should be much better, the close-ups you refer to that increase the ""graininess were not a post-production issue since non-linear editing did not exist at the time. The "" graininess you refer to are pixels, and the squiggles are not actual squiggles, but are actually the movement of the characters and the ever-changing image of the props and background as the camera moves. While I do believe the blu-Ray transfer of a DVD transfer (losing a great amount of quality), I don't believe that in post-production it was quality and shade-corrected with a simple photo editing software. I don't even believe Photoshop was utilized for that. I'm guessing it was either done in Final Cut Pro or Avid, and quite lazily, I might add if the original film print was available for transfer. However, it's possible that it may not have been available, for reasons such as, let's say, legal issues or something.
In regard to the film, itself, anyone who denies it's not a hilarious classic is kidding themselves. For those of you who haven't seen it yet, don't listen to the guy who actually has the wherewithal to compare its comedic genius to Scary Movie 3. At least he redeemed himself a bit by comparing it to Animal House, as well, but still. The film is unique in its execution and fresh comedy, For those of you who agree with the guy in the above paragraph, perhaps you'd fare better buying something like Ted or Bad Teacher.
Mel Brooks is a Comedic Svengali, and this film is just as funny to me every time I watch it. I rank it right up there with Blazing Saddles, High Anxiety (his homage to Hitchcock), and To Be or Not to Be.",1458259200,2,2093,4.554376657824934

2601061,5,B000G6BLWE,"Mel Brooks' parodies are like your favorite, worn-out couch. You know it's not the greatest in style, taste and quality, but it just feels so damn comfortable. Of late, most of Mel's spoofs have been off the mark, his work mellowing into predictability. In fact, you really have to go all the way back to 1974 to see Brooks at his sharpest. In that year we were awarded ""Blazing Saddles"" AND ""Young Frankenstein.""

Perhaps ""Young Frankenstein"" is not definitive Mel Brooks, although he directed it. Gene Wilder, who not only stars but co-wrote it with Mel, was the inspiration to make this movie. And it's his influence, I think, that brings the best out in Mel. When spoofing a historical era, movie genre or legendary tale, Brooks' satirical bag of tricks always included a hodgepodge of crude sight gags, burlesque schtick and stale Jewish jokes done at rapid-fire pace. The plot became an after-thought, working around the barrage of unsubtle humor. In targeting the classic Frankenstein' series, however, Brooks worked in reverse, wisely focusing on plot, tone and atmosphere, then complementing them with clever, carefully constructed bits.

A rich staple of comedy pros from Brooks' fun factory (Mel graciously did not cast himself here) were employed to wring out the most laughs possible out of the fresh, inventive material. Gene Wilder plays the frizzy-haired, eruptive college professor Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced FRONK-en-STEEN), grandson of the infamous scientist, who gives in to the maniacal tendencies of his mad ancestor after inheriting the late Baron's Teutonic castle. His simmer-to-boil antics have seldom been put to better use, while only pop-eyed Marty Feldman, who gets to break the fourth wall as Igor (prounouced EYE-gor), the dim, oddball assistant, could milk a hump for all its worth. Kenneth Mars too gets a lot of mileage out of his one-armed, slush-mouthed inspector. In the film's most difficult role, Peter Boyle's appearance as the Monster is jarring at first, looking like a cross between Herman Munster and Uncle Fester. But he increasingly wins you over, earning even a little empathy along the way. His character is the most crucial for this parody to work right and he succeeds, figuring in a high percentage of the comedy highlights.

Representing the distaff side, Madeline Kahn is one cool cucumber, stealing focus whenever she's on camera as the placid, meticulous, hopelessly stuck-up fiancee Elizabeth; Cloris Leachman sinks her teeth into the role of the grotesque Frau Bl&uuml;cher, whose mere mention of her name sends horses into panic; and Teri Garr is delightful as a dinghy Deutschlander who assists Frankenstein in his wild experiments and other things.

An amalgamation of Universal's earliest and best Frankenstein' movies (""Frankenstein,"" ""Bride of Frankenstein"" and ""Son of Frankenstein,"" this spoof relies on close imitation and Brooks took painstaking methods to recreate the look and feel of James Whale's original sets, black-and-white photography and musical score. It pays off in spades.

Nearly 30 years later, this movie still leaves me in stitches. Wilder and Garr's revolving secret door bit is still priceless, as is Cloris Leachman's ovaltine' routine and the Wilder/Boyle ""Puttin' On the Ritz"" tie-and-tail duet. Boyle and the unbilled Gene Hackman in the ""Blind Hermit"" scene ripped off from ""Bride of Frankenstein"" are uproarious, easily winning the award for sustained hilarity in a single sketch. Add Feldman's hump and Mars' troublesome mechanical arm and what you have is rib-tickling entertainment from start to finish. Madeline Kahn's post-coital, cigarette-smoking scene with ol zipperneck' who leaves her in a sexual snit must go down in Hollywood annals as the funniest scene ever caught on camera. Certainly Jeanette MacDonald's puristic rendition of ""Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life"" will never have quite the same meaning again after you've heard Madeline's spin on it.

""Blazing Saddles"" indeed has its insane moments but when it comes to toasting Mel Brooks in the years to come, ""Young Frankenstein"" should certainly stand front and center when representing this clown prince of comedy.",1455840000,8,4178,5.322727272727272

Since then, I watched it so many times I can quote lines from the script and often do!  This is a Mel Brooks cult film masterpiece.

I still have VCR tapes but I no longer have a VCR tape player. Just buying the DVD version seems like the way to go but I have thought about copying the tapes to DVD. I am not sure the quality would be as good as just getting a new DVD. Even so, I find it difficult to get rid of the old tapes. Maybe I could donate them to a thrift store. Are there many people that still can watch them? Do they even make VCR players any more? I really don't think so. I don't remember seeing one in a store recently. I suppose a thrift store would have a VCR player in it too so I guess my tapes could be watched by someone if they wanted too. Oh well, I'll figure something out.

We all laughed, we all smiled, and we're all going to watch it again at some point because this movie is that good and very worth returning to time and again.

2601521,5,B000G6BLWE,"Young Frankenstein is one of the best comedies of all time, even if it's sometimes oerlooked.  It's another hit comedy from the genius of Mel Brooks who also brought us Blazing Saddles, High Anxiety, and The Producers(not to mention Spaceballs.)
The plot is a spoof, of course, of the Frankenstein novella and the myriad of movies that followed.  Here, Gene Wilder plays the great, if flawed, doctor who gives up a cushy professorship at a great med school in order to seek out a mysterious inheritance from his European relative...Anyway, it leads him to a great castle(of course) where he ends up with the strangest entourage in history.  Frau Blucher(Cloris Leachman) is the mistress of the castle.  Marty Feldman plays his hunchback assistant.  Peter Boyle plays the monster.  Kenneth Mars plays a local (Transylvanian?) official who's concerned about the doctor's practices.  Gene Hackman has a brief cameo as the blind man who accepts the 'monster'(Peter Boyle) innocently until a little mishap ruins the moment.  Terri Garr rounds out the company as a sexy vamp who's also wonderfully funny...

The genius is how this is presented, with great fun and a brilliant script.  Any further description would totally ruin it for you.

2601541,4,B000G6BLWE,"The Blu-ray version is totally worth it.  (No review here of the movie, since that can be found in many other reviews and websites).  The graininess is a bit high in places, but not detracting from what I believe was the director's overall intent/effect.  People need to understand Blu-ray, DVD and film basics -- the film has a very large amount of data on it.  The DVD has very little, by comparison to the film.  The Blu-ray contains more information, but still much less than what is on the film.  Even old film contains a large amount of information, which the DVD won't hold, yet the Blu-ray will still hold more than the DVD.

Get the Blu-ray version.  If you enjoy movies and their quality, you need this version.

As for the other products included in the Anniversary edition -- take it or leave it.  A lot of hype on how 'great' the movie is/was is over-the-top, but the commentary is good if you like and appreciate that aspect.  Decent background on the actors is given, too.  Although some conflict with the Gene Hackman part from what I read back then.  Gene didn't want to do the part, but Mel 'guaranteed' it would be shot in two days (or less).  Gene just didn't have the time, but with the guarantee, agreed.  The shoot took more than 10 days according to the info at the time and Gene was not happy at all.  In this commentary though, it was kind of glossed over and the animosity of the time was not conveyed.",1413676800,,1429,4.417624521072797

2601576,5,B000G6BLWE,"There are some comedy movies that are so great, so beloved, that they need no introduction. ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" ""Airplane,"" ""Animal House,"" ""Ghostbusters""... ones that are recognizable merely by being quoted.

But one of the best is ""Young Frankenstein,"" Mel Brooks' gutsplittingly funny parody of Universal's series of Frankenstein movies. While combining elements from at least three movies, it's a tight, fast-moving string of seamless gags, running jokes and wild-eyed mad science from Gene Wilder. And of course, it has one of those scripts that is just outstandingly quotable (""HE... VAS... MY.... BOYFRIEND!"").

Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Wilder) -- pronounced ""Fronkensteen"" -- is a talented young neurosurgeon who tries very hard to distance himself from his grandfather's notorious experiments. ""My grandfather's work was doodoo! I am not interested in death! The only thing that concerns me is the preservation of life!"" he yells at his class, just before accidentally sticking a scalpel in his own leg.

Then a solicitor informs him that he has inherited his family estate in Transylvania, including a castle, a quirky hunchbacked servant named Igor (pronounced ""eye-gore"") (Marty Feldman) and a shapely assistant, Inga (Teri Garr). While exploring his new castle, Frederick discovers his grandfather's lab and private journals -- and immediately embraces his family's legacy of necromancy and mad science.

So he and Igor start merrily robbing graves and stealing brains, despite the suspicions of the monacled Inspector Kemp (Kenneth Mars). Unfortunately, the monster who arises has an ""Abby Normal"" brain, and spreads terror throughout the region as soon as the housekeeper Frau Blucher (Cloris Leachman) -- cue whinnies --  releases him. Also, Frederick's prissy fiancee (Madeleine Kahn) has arrived. Frederick must recapture the creature and save him from the rioting villagers... which may put his own life at risk.

""Young Frankenstein"" is impressive enough as a comedy, but it's even more impressive when you consider that it parodies chunks from at least three different movies, including the little-known ""Son of Frankenstein."" Even more impressive is the fact that this movie was trimmed down from an original cut that was twice as long, mainly by chopping out every joke that didn't bring down the house.

So what do you get? You get a lean, sleek mass of jokes that are wildly quotable (""Give him the sedagive!""), memorable (the cat shriek during the darts game) and wildly bizarre (a certain odd sex scene involving ""Ah! Sweet Mystery of Life."" And there are a lot of clever little touches. The whole thing is done in black-and-white, for a more ""vintage"" feel, and apparently Brooks rented the original electrical gear from the original ""Frankenstein"" movies.

But it also works as a story about a somewhat mad scientist who does what we all wish Victor Frankenstein had done -- try to help and protect the monster instead of shunning him. That's a good deal of the reason why the hypersensitive, cheating Frederick is nevertheless a very likable guy -- he's crazy, but he's also got a good heart and some real affection for the monster... when he doesn't think it's trying to kill him.

Wilder is friggin' awesome here, all bulging eyes and wild hair, alternately hammy (""... and penetrate... into the very womb of IMPERVIOUS NATURE HERSELF!"") and childish (""There. I'm touching it. Happy?""). Marty Feldman's Igor is the perfect foil -- an impish little creature who just seems to be enjoying every opportunity to cause just a little confusion and chaos (""What hump?""). And all the supporting cast is similarly astounding -- prissy yet sexually voracious Kahn, innocently sexy Garr, mildly terrifying Leachman (whinny!), and a brief but delightful cameo by Gene Hackman.

""Young Frankenstein"" is one of the greatest comedies ever made -- a fast-moving, relentlessly funny parody that is still a delight even to those who haven't seen Universal's monster movies. A must-see.",1408233600,2,4017,5.2625

Setting the stage, Wilder plays a younger Dr Frankenstein, as the grandchild of the original. The Young Frankenstein is embarrassed by his legacy when he receives a diary from his grandfather. The story moves along quickly as he studies his grandfather's work to create a new human from dead flesh.

2601689,4,B000G6BLWE,"When I first saw Young Frankenstein, lo those many years ago, I believed that this cast with Mel Brooks directing could pull off a silent film. And prophet that I am, Mel's next movie was: Silent Movie.

This was a safe call in large part thanks to Marty Feldman who was a classic vaudevillian funny man. Here he is cast as Igor (Its pronounced Eye Gore!) and is the face that launched 898 laughs- the other 102 got edited out.

The core of the Mel Brooks regulars, Gene Wilder (The young Frankenstein, Its Pronounced Fraunk en stein!), Cloris Lechman, (Blucher!) and Madeline Kahn (Elizabeth - Taffeta Darling...) all delivere memorable lines even if Gene Wilder does his shouting, meltdown a few times to many. Peter Boyle -The Creature, with no lines for 90% of the movie provides innocence, malevolence, devilish facials and his improvisation of ""Puttin on the Ritz"" all but steals the show.  This is an early movie for Teri Garr. Her character, Inga (He vould have an enormous schwanzstucker *Wuff*) is like Igor, a minor supporting role. Like Igor she adds far more to the humor than the role requires.

At its base this is a loving satire of the great black and white monster movies and especially the early Frankenstein movies. The included Making of Young Frankenstein states that the main inspiration was Bride of Frankenstein. ""Son of..."" and the original are all referenced. My favorite factoid is that this was the first movie to have the use of the original Frankenstein laboratory complete with Ken Strickfaden one of the original technicians who kept the electrical gear working and created some new toys. What also comes through is a respect for the original intent of the Mary Shelly book. The comedic Dr. Frankenstein never abandons his creation, nor does he ignore his responsibility towards his creature. Shelly's original intent was not: do not play with nature, but rather: take responsibility for what you `do - do'.( I love quoting from this flick).

As much as I have enjoyed watching, and re-watching Young Frankenstein, there are scenes that I tend to fast forward. So an advantage of owning is you can fast forward. Those individual bits that drag or go over the top , can be skipped in favor of favorite bits that many showings later still make this a favorite comedy.

In case you missed it: This is a funny movie. You will want to own it. Its worth many replays even if you find parts you want to skip.",1368921600,2,2434,4.742316784869977

Gene Wilder is perfect as the young Frankenstein and is surrounded by a super cast that helps bring this (and the monster) to life. I love Teri Garr in just about anything but this is Marty Feldman's movie. ""Werewolf."" ""There, wolf."" Superb.

But it is the characters brought to life by a superb cast that makes this movie a MUST for any Mel Brooks collection.

Gene Wilder, an incredibly young Terri Garr, Peter Boyle, Madeline Kahn and Marty Feldman have you laughing at times to the point of tears, while Cloris Leachman and Kenneth Mars as Frau Blucher and Inspector Kemp just keep the laughs - and the raunch - going.

2601751,4,B000G6BLWE,"Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder has never been a bad combo. And it`s not this time around.
Fore me it`s a series of chuckle moments thrue the whole movie, with big funny moments here and there.
This is a comedy that`s allmost perfect in every way and I recomend this to ennyone that`s seen a Mel Brooks movie and liked it.
All I can say is ""put the candle back""",1339545600,,356,4.1
2601752,5,B000G6BLWE,"The DVD box says ""The funniest comedy of all time!"" Well, maybe; I'd certainly put it in the running for that title.

Gene Wilder is young Victor Frankenstein, who goes to the length of changing the pronunciation of his name (""Frahnk-en-steen"") in an attempt to distance himself from his notorious grandfather. But when he inherits the Frankenstein spooky old castle in Transylvania (""Pardon me boy, is this the Transylvania station?""), he soon falls under the spell of the violin music, the spider-webbed equipment, and the notebooks of his grandfather, carefully preserved by his grandfather's former lover (played to perfection by Cloris Leachman, the horses whinny in fright every time her name is mentioned). He also has the grandson of his grandfather's assistant Igor (That's ""Eye-gore"" he says, after Frankenstein corrects him on the pronunciation of his name), and a ""lab assistant"" named Inga, played by Teri Garr. (""Goodness, what knockers!"")

He left his devoted fiance back in the city (Madeline Kahn), but she eventually shows up at the castle.

Of course they manage to reanimate a monster similar to his grandfather's, except this one has a zipper in his neck. He's played by Peter Boyle, who dutifully goes through many of the cliche scenes from the original Boris Karloff rendition, turning each one on its head. My absolute favorite is the blind hermit who so thoughtfully offers him soup, wine and a cigar.

There are so many inspired twists to this movie that I'd hate to ruin any of them for you. But I'm betting you will never again be able to hear the song, ""Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life"" without getting slightly hysterical.",1336953600,,1646,4.9963503649635035

Although Mel Brooks directed this film, Gene Wilder did most of the writing from my knowledge. I first saw this before seeing any of the original Frankenstein films. I thought it was funny, but it was even better after watching Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, etc..

Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder are 2 of my favorites in comedy films. If you have never seen a Mel Brooks film, I would start here. It so funny you will find your self watching over and over again.

I just love that it was shot in Black and White. It looks good on this DVD. If i remember correctly it only has Mono Sound. But honestly, do you really need a 5.1 mix for this?

Buy it now!(If you already haven't)",1311984000,,701,4.33587786259542
2601763,5,B000G6BLWE,"In my opinion, this is the best of the Mel Brooks movies.  It strikes just the right balance between funny enough and too silly.  Too often, Mel Brooks movies are too silly - the laughs are their, but so is the juvenile (or just dumb) stuff.  Young Frankenstein tilts toward funny and away from silly.

The movie is a spoof of the old black and white Frankenstein movies, so if you haven't seen the old movies much of the humor and situations won't make any sense.  So my 8 year old granddaughter didn't get the movie at all.  Mel Brooks movies also contain a generous helping of Jewish (or Yiddish) humor, so if you aren't from some place with a Jewish/Yiddish history, again, much of the humor will be lost on you.  This movie was seen by many of the Baby Boomer generation while they were growing up, and so it contains a lot of pop culture references for Boomers.  If you are younger, you might want to see this movie just to catch some of the things your parents are talking about.

To summarize, a funny movie and a source of pop culture references.",1310515200,,1055,4.369230769230769

2601768,4,B000G6BLWE,"The Young Frankenstein ""Special Edition"" DVD was made for old-school narrow-screen TV displays, not 16:9 widescreen HDTV displays.  If you have a modern widescreen HDTV the movie's picture will probably appear vertically squished (or horizontally stretched).  To watch this movie properly your HDTV equipment needs the capability of correcting the image by stretching the picture vertically.  Some HDTVs and widescreen displays do not have that feature.

The problem is in the use of the word ""widescreen,"" because these DVDs are made two ways:  ""letterbox widescreen"" (for narrow-screen TVs) or ""anamorphic widescreen"" (for widescreen HDTVs).  This DVD's packaging simply uses the word ""widescreen"" in at least two places, which can be very misleading.  Many older DVDs (like this one) are labeled ""widescreen"" but are not anamorphic.

If the widescreen is not anamorphic it also has reduced image resolution, somewhat reducing picture quality, although the quality loss might not be very noticeable to you.  In Young Frankenstein the picture quality is intentionally grainy anyway, so picture sharpness is not a significant problem.

Despite the ""widescreen"" issue, for a true fan this Young Frankenstein ""Special Edition"" DVD is a must-have!  The special features include a wealth of priceless material, including complete edited scenes which were omitted from the finished movie.  Many of these omitted scenes had hysterical moments, including the end of Dr. Frankenstein's message in the ""reading of the will"" scene.  Some of the material in the Mexican interviews is very good as well, particularly the Marty Feldman interview.  Various versions of the movie's TV spots are included, and some of these spots had me laughing out loud.

If the picture format of this DVD is not a problem for you, I highly recommend it.",1297209600,,1823,5.392226148409894

2601784,5,B000G6BLWE,"Without looking for flaws or problems I just choose to enjoy this movie for the masterpiece that it is. Gene Hackman has an amazing role as the blind hermit, making this film as good as any comedy I've ever seen in his segment. It was years later before I realized the guy playing the monster, Peter Boyle is the dad on Everybody Loves Raymond. He's hilarious here in this movie. Marty Feldman could do anything he wanted to in the comedy genre and be entertaining, and this movie bears that out perfectly where Marty plays the part of Igor. Frau Blucher played by Cloris Leachman seems to be a role tailor made for her, and the mention of her name in the movie makes the horses nervous. Teri Garr has some moments in the film to make young boys successfully get through puberty, and Madeline Kahn is excellent for her portrayal of an annoying conceited nincompoop woman engaged to Gene Wilder's character - Dr. Frankenstein. Mel Brooks was the howl of a werewolf and the voice of a cat accidentally hit by a dart, but otherwise doesn't appear in this film - which really surprised me since he has important roles out in front for most of his movies. I thought attention to detail was good for the sets, and was pleasantly surprised by the casting. Very enjoyable, and definitely worth buying this DVD.

2601788,3,B000G6BLWE,"Young Frankenstein is certainly a classic film, and I feel somewhat bad about giving it only 3 stars.  The film shows its age, not in the jokes themselves, but in the way they are delivered.  I've never liked films that wink too much at the audience, and Young Frankenstein winks constantly - especially Igor, but also the monster and others.  I found that every time this happened, I was taken out of the movie and reminded that I was watching something, which was distracting and ultimately causes me to remove one star.  The other star is removed because, well, it's not The Producers, which is, for my money, a better (and funnier!) film.

A plot synopsis is probably not required, as the film is a spoof-homage (almost equal parts each) of the various Golden-Age Frankenstein films.  Young Dr. Frankenstein (""It's pronounced Fronk-en-steen"") is ashamed of his famous anscestor until he learns he is the sole heir to the family's estates.  He arrives in Transylvania and finds Igor (""It's pronounced Eye-gore"") and the original doctor's book ""How I Did It"".  He resolves to build his own monster to prove that with a good brain it would give a good monster.  Unfortunately, Igor screws up and we're left with the standard grunting and homocidal monster.  This does lead to the two greatest set-pieces in the film, however: Frankenstein and the monster performing ""Putting on the Ritz"" and the monster's visit to a blind and clumsy hermit monk.  These scenes are laugh-out-loud funny even on repeated viewings, and it all depends on the performance of Peter Boyle as the monster.  In fact, Boyle's and Teri Garr's (as the ditzy lab assistant) performances are the best in the film.

This is a fine DVD edition - Mel Brook's audio commentary is surprisingly interesting and informative.  It's especially good to hear him admit his mistakes (he wanted to cut the 'Putting on the Ritz' scene) and other inside information.  Less interesting are the deleted scenes (most are not that funny, although I liked the ""Reading of the will"" cut scene). The outtakes are mostly people laughing and ruining the shot, so get boring quickly.

I immediately fell in love with this comedy. And I'm still in love with it. If any film deserves to be called a ""classic"", it's this one. Not only did writer-director Mel Brooks & writer-star Gene Wilder capture the visual black & white beauty of the old horror classics, but they pulled off the impossible--a kooky, irreverent comedy that's also a sweet, loving tribute to those films. Every single joke & sight gag hits the bullseye, and each & every performance is memorable (made bittersweet by the passing of Marty Feldman, Madeline Kahn & Peter Boyle over the years). There are so many great comedy bits crammed into this movie that it's almost futile to make a list here, so I'll spare you the reading.

You know why?  Because it's genius and classic.  In fact, if someone doesn't wax nostalgia over this piece of cinemagic magic, they should be flogged or pitied for their lack of joy in the world.",1255219200,2,549,4.797872340425532

Young Frankenstein is certainly better if you've seen the original movies (though that applies to pretty much every such film) and if you have you'll be sure to appreciate Mel Brooks' light-hearted take on the Frankenstein movies, which movies quickly and has the added benefit of actually creating likable characters, so even if you're not captivated by every joke and pratfall you'll at least be in the presence of some enjoyable types.

Johnny Depp is a brilliant actor, no doubt. With a director like Tim Burton, a humongous budget and all the modern technology a thespian could hope for - his Willy Wonka still could not outshine Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka - proof of Wilder's enormous talent.

That being said, the beginning of Young Frankenstein almost lost me. I found my mind wandering and also wondering if could I focus on two hours of this odd deadpan. Gene Wilder's reputation is what kept my attention as Silver Streak, another of his slow starting classics, crept into my head.

By the time I got to meet Igor (Marty Feldman) I was starting to come around and when Peter Boyle's monster moaned his way into the picture I was hooked.

The second half of the film had plenty of side splitting moments, but two caused me to scramble for the rewind button as I wiped away tears of laughter. The monster's thumb set ablaze by the blind man (Gene Hackman) was worth another look and the Putting on the Ritz routine had me trying to think where to rank it on my all-time favorite scenes list.

It was great to see such a cast of legends in their earlier years. It's hard not to laugh at Boyle (I can never think of him without thinking ""holy crap!"") and it's hard not to look at Teri Garr. Did it make much sense? Not always, but it made me laugh and I can say that I had a good time. That's what movies are all about.

2601795,5,B000G6BLWE,"Young Frankenstein (1974) was a five star movie experience for me when I saw it open in a Manhattan theater in New York in 1974.  I saw this opening with a friend who was a Universal horror movie buff and an NBC film editor.  He indicated while we waited anxiously for the film to start that Mel Brooks was currently very hot and the expectations of all the young people in the audience appeared to reflect that fact.  Although the plot was conceived by Gene Wilder it was modified and directed by Mel Brooks and may have been his best movie.

It almost made me wet my pants several times and was hilariously funny from start to finish. Some of the props were from the original Frankenstein by Universal. It drew on and satirized: Frankenstein, The Bride of Frankenstein and The Son of Frankenstein. It also went to Broadway in the form of a musical comedy, which I never saw.",1248998400,,876,4.45625
2601796,5,B000G6BLWE,"Thirty-five years later, this film still provides a ton of laughs.  It's always great fun to watch.

It's always good to see the late Marty Feldman, too.  His face was hysterical and perfect for this film. In fact, he, along with the camera-work, really make this film one to watch and enjoy multiple times.

Teri Garr was at her best and never looked as pretty as did in here. Add in the great talents of Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Gene Hackman, Peter Boyle, Cloris Leachman, etc., and you have a memorable movie with a lot of memorable scenes.

Looking at the Frankenstien ""monster"" in a tuxedo or sitting up in bed with a cigar reading ""The Wall Street Journal"" are just a few of the outlandish scenes, along Wilder entering the mansion commenting on the ""nice knockers.""

Kudos, also, for Mel Brooks having the good sense to film this in black-and-white. It may have been his best film, although ""Blazing Saddles"" would give it a run for its money. My only complaint was Wilder's constant yelling, which can give you a headache after awhile! Still, this has to be considered one of the best ""comedy classics"" ever.

The comedy may be a bit corny by today's standards and there is some sexual humor, but it's all double entendre and innuendo--not nearly as racy or vulgar as some of Brooks' other films.

2601801,5,B000G6BLWE,"Young Frankenstein is one hour and forty six minutes long and was released on December 15, 1974. The whole movie was shot in black and white and incorporates Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, and Son of Frankenstein. The movie was played strictly for laughs and it has a lot of them. Some of the on going gags are Igor (pronounced ""Eye-gor"") ever changing hump on his back. On scene it is on the left side and on another scene the right side. Also when ever anyone says the name Frau Blcher or just Blcher, the horses goes wild. Also there are few minor mistakes as well. Gene Wilder role of Dr. Frederick Frankenstein is the grandson of the late Dr. Victor Frankenstein. In one scene; he is referred to as the great-grandson. Also Inspector Kemp right arm is artificial, but when he is searching for the Monster in the woods, it is on the left side. Finally when Dr. Frederick Frankenstein and Inspector Kemp are playing darts, Dr. Frankenstein only throws two darts through the window. When Inspector Kemp heads toward his car and drive off; the scene shows six darts. The movie starts off with the coffin of Baron Beaufort Von Frankenstein, the Great-grandfather of Dr. Frederick Frankenstein, being open.  A lawyer for the Frankenstein family is sent to the United States to tell Dr. Frederick Frankenstein that he has inherited his Great-grandfather estate. Dr. Frederick Frankenstein travels to Transylvania and meets up with Igor and Inga. One night Dr. Frankenstein hears music and along with Inga investigate the source of the music. It leads him to his grand-father private libray and the book How I Did It. After reading the book, Dr. Frankenstein believes he can do it as well and did up a body of a recently huge criminal. Igor is sent to the Brain Depository. After dropping the good brain, Igor picks up the adnormal and brings is back to  Dr. Frankenstein. When the creature is bought back to life and goes wild in the lab, given a sedative, Dr. Frankenstein asks Igor whose brain is in the that creature. Igor calmly replies that it is an Abby Normal's brain. Dr. Frankenstein is angry with Igor that he gave him an abnormal brain. The monster escape and we have the blind man scene where his taken in and the blind man does his best to be polite. When the blind man offers the Creature a cigar and tries to light one up for him, he burns the creature thumb and the Creatue leaves screaming. He finally make his way back to the castle where Dr. Frankenstein shows him love and compasion. At an evening gather Dr. Frankenstein shows off The Creature to fellow scientits and doctorts, however, a lightbulb burst and The Creature goes into a fit a rage and is taken into custady. It while The Creature is in custady that the prison guard mocks him and The Creature breaks the chains and escape. Dr. Frankenstein plays music to bring The Creature back to the castle for a serious operation. The operation is a succes and The Creatue is nolonger evil. Despite the minor goofs, this is Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder at their finest. I am giving Young Frankenstein an AAAAA+++++.

2601802,3,B000G6BLWE,"Poor Frederick von Frankenstein (Gene Wilder).  He is trying to live down the legacy of his grandfather.  He's even gone so far as to insist that his last name is pronounced Fronkensteen.  But his career as a neurosurgeon comes to a quick stop when he is informed he has just inherited the family manor in Transylvania.

Traveling there, he meets up with new lab assistant Inga (Teri Garr) and Igor (Marty Feldman).  By the way, that last one is pronounced Eyegore, in case you were wondering.  But it's Frau Blucher (Cloris Leachman) who gives everyone a bad fright, even the horses.

Slowly, Frederick begins to discover his grandfather's secrets.  Unable to resist the pull of destiny, he creates his own Monster (Peter Boyle).  Will history repeat itself?

I find Mel Brooks films to be hit and miss, usually in the same film.  Parts are funny, and parts are just okay.  That was certainly the case here.  There were several running gags I really enjoyed, and a few of the scenes had me laughing pretty hard.  But there were long stretches where I wasn't laughing.  And, frankly, I kept trying to understand what some scenes were doing in the film.  That's probably my own fault for not watching the films Mel was spoofing first.

Now I knew going into the movie that there were be plenty of double entendres.  And I didn't care for them that much.  But by far the worst part of the film for me was the rape.  It was supposed to be played for laughs, but I found it and the after math downright offensive, especially since they were supposed to be funny.

2601803,5,B000G6BLWE,"This film is definitely one of the greatest comedies of all time!

It is basically a parody of the Frankenstein movies of the 1930's and 40's as well as the monster movie genre in general. The jokes are extremely funny and the movie is full of so many classic scenes and lines that I couldn't mention all of them in this review.

It stars Gene Wilder as Fredrick Frankenstein, a lecturer at a medical school who is so ashamed of his grandfather's work as a mad scientist, chooses to pronounce his name ""Fronkensteen"" instead of Frankenstein. He journeys to his family castle in Transylvania because of an inheritance. On his way there, he meets his innocently hilarious new lab assistant Inga (Teri Garr) and the hunchback Igor (EYE-gor), played to perfection by Marty Feldman. Upon arriving at the castle, he also meets the sinister Frau Blucher (Cloris Leachman). Later, he discovers his grandfather's laboratory and sets out to recreate the monster based on an instruction book that was left behind. Peter Boyle portrays the monster and is very funny.

The film also features Madeline Kahn in her traditional Mel Brooks appearance as Fredrick's girlfriend Elizabeth. Gene Hackman also has a small cameo role.

As for bonus features, the most interesting ones are a making-of featurette and audio commentary for the film by Mel Brooks himself.

Overall, this is a timeless comedy classic that I very highly recommend.",1234656000,,1419,4.970464135021097

The quality of the supporting cast and the characters they play are outstanding:  Marty Feldman's Igor, with the moveable hump, Cloris Leachman's dour Frau Blucher (and the equine terror raised in response to her name), Peter Boyle's Frankenstein (who can forget him dancing and singing to Putting on the Ritz?), and Gene Hackman's little gem of a cameo as the blind man.

2601819,4,B000G6BLWE,"Young Frankenstein (Mel Brooks, 1974)

I watched two movies over the weekend I'd only ever seen pieces of before and figured, from the pieces I'd seen, that I'd hate. One was Dr. Strangelove, and it fulfilled my expectations. Young Frankenstein was the other, and this time, I have to say, I was quite wrong. Young Frankenstein is superb all the way around. (It probably helps that I had a recent re-watch of James Whale's Frankenstein under my belt, for those of you who haven't seen it yet.)

The plot concerns Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (""that's FRONK-en-shteen"") (Gene Wilder), the grandson of Victor, the doctor in the original. He's spent years trying to get rid of the family taint, which all comes spiralling down around him when he inherits the old castle and the accompanying lab. Leaving behind his cloying, uptight fiance Elizabeth (Madeline Kahn), he travels to the castle and meets the staff-- Igor (Marty Feldman), Inga (Teri Garr), and Frau Blucher (Cloris Leachman). Surreptitiously encouraged by Inga, Frederick becomes obsessed with the idea of repeating the experiments of his grandfather, and soon, the new monster (Peter Boyle) comes to life. The rest of the movie is half homage to James Whale's original and half screwball comedy.

The real strength of this movie is the cast; Mel Brooks could've sat back and pointed a camera, and they could make this work. Wilder, Boyle, Feldman, Leachman, Garr, Kahn, Gene Hackman, and Richard Haydn (in his final film) are all either in career-best form of darned close to it here. All are actors with impeccable comic timing (yes, even Gene Hackman), and it often seems as if Brooks just said ""okay, do whatever it is you were planning to do, then put it way over the top."" The result is in no way a sophisticated comedy; this is just a straightforward gut-buster with dozens, if not hundreds of quotable one-liners and great sight gags. One for the books. ****",1219104000,,1924,4.895705521472393

2601821,5,B000G6BLWE,"WARNING: This film may lead to incontinence due to hysterical laughter!

Mel Brooks' 1974 film, Young Frankenstein is arguably the funniest film ever made. Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks, who had previously collaborated on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Producers/dp/B000BMY2LU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Producers</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blazing-Saddles/dp/B0001Z4OXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blazing Saddles</a>, wrote the script together. This film is a superbly crafted parody of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Universal-Frankenstein/dp/B0001CNRLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Universal Frankenstein</a>&nbsp;films.

The story begins with young Doctor Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced Fronkensteen) discovering that he has inherited his great-grandfather's Transylvanian mansion. Upon his arrival Dr. Frankenstein meets Igor (pronounced Eye-Gore), an eccentric servant with a hunched back. He is also introduced to the vivacious vixen, Inga who just wants ""to have a roll in ze hay."" Before long Frederick discovers the secret library of his infamous grandfather, Victor von Frankenstein and becomes totally obsessed with creating a ""monster"" of his own. Naturally this doesn't go over well with the local peasantry. After the monster goes on a rampage of terror (or more accurately a rampage of hilarity), the villagers form an angry mob and set out to destroy it. But don't worry, all's well that ends well in the world of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mel-Brooks/dp/B000E6ESIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mel Brooks</a>.

The gags in the film are hilarious (I won't ruin them for any of you yet to see the film). The satire is heightened by the brilliance of the set design, and by the black and white cinematography, which perfectly captures the look of classic horror films. The cast is terrific especially&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gene-Wilder/dp/0312337078/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gene Wilder</a>&nbsp;as the infirm Dr. Frankenstein, Marty Feldman as the zany hunchback Igor, Teri Garr as the delightfully ditzy assistant Inga, Madeline Kahn as Dr. Frankenstein's obnoxious and vain fiance, Kenneth Mars as the one-armed Inspector Kemp, Cloris Leachman as the mysterious Frau Blucher whose name incites terror in the hearts of all horses, and Peter Boyle as the mumbling monster. Also look for a memorable cameo appearance by Gene Hackman.

As often as Young Frankenstein is referred to as being ""the greatest comedy ever"", it's odd that it never received any awards for its talented cast and crew. They certainly deserved them. There are few works of comedic genius out there today, for which I am grateful to Mel Brooks for giving us this loony masterpiece to watch again and again.

The DVD features some great supplemental material including cast interviews, an audio commentary with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mel-Brooks/dp/0470225262/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mel Brooks</a>&nbsp;reminiscing about the making of the film, production stills, trailers and TV spots, a wonderful documentary, seven deleted scenes and an outrageously funny blooper reel (watch the documentary before the blooper reel for maximum effect).

2601823,5,B000G6BLWE,"Quite honestly one of the greatest comedies ever filmed, `Young Frankenstein' is a marvel of cinema and a treasure for every film library.  The film sports some hilarious performances, iconic at that, not to mention a tightly woven script with jokes that actually land; all of which come together beautifully to create an extremely memorable comedic experience.  It's rare for me to find a comedy that covers every base.  As much as I enjoy a good comedy I often refer to dramatic films when speaking of `the best of film' but I would be a liar if I said that `Young Frankenstein' isn't one of the greatest `movies' ever made, let alone comedies.

The film follows the grandson of Dr. Frankenstein, Frederick Frankenstein, as he inherits his grandfather's castle.  Frankenstein has spent his entire life trying to live down the reputation of his experimental grandfather but he soon finds himself falling into his granddads footsteps.  Equipped with a hunchbacked sidekick Igor, the beautiful Inga and the mysterious Frau Blucher, Frankenstein makes his own attempt at creating life from death, with some disastrous (not to mention hilarious) consequences.

Gene Wilder was one hilarious actor.  I love his character creations, Frederick Frankenstein resting right up there with Willy Wonka for me.  He truly shines here, it's no wonder he considered this his favorite of all the films he made.  Marty Feldman steals this film though as Igor.  His performance is comedic genius.  The way he always manages to steal the limelight in the scene, becoming the focal point of our attention due to his marvelous comedic timing.  Teri Garr is also right on point and effortlessly captivating, but she can't hold a candle to Cloris Leachman or Madeline Kahn who are both uproarious here; especially Leachman (that whole violin scene leaves me in stitches every time).

We cannot leave out the late, great, Peter Boyle who dominates this film as the monster.  He makes him human, yes, but more importantly he makes him funny.  That whole `Puttin on the Ritz' scene (arguably the best scene in the film) is precisely the reason why this film is a `must see-must own' staple for any lover of film.

Mel Brooks was known for his comedies, many of which are considered classics and are adored by many.  In my humble opinion, this is his finest film.  It gets everything right, and that is a rare treat indeed.  There is not a dry spot found here, each and every gag landing right where it is supposed to (word is that for every joke that landed there were two or three that fell flat so there was a massive editing procedure done to save the film and deliver this finely polished finished product).

There are plenty of spoofs out there today, films that take something classic and tear it to shreds in an effort to elicit some laughs.  Sadly many of them fall flat.  `Young Frankenstein' is the film that they should all aspire to be because it is the one film that actually manages to deliver a unique and memorable experience without tarnishing the good name of the original.  Yes, `Young Frankenstein' draws all of its humor from cracking fun at Mary Shelley's classic, but this film manages to become its own film, separate from its inspiration and thus earning its very own place in our hearts.

There are few films that I could sit and watch time and time again.  This is right at the top of that very short list.",1212969600,4,3407,4.771331058020478

2601829,5,B000G6BLWE,"It's always a bit dangerous when a medium uses itself as its subject. So paintings about painting, plays about the theatre, rock and roll songs about how hard it is to be a star all tend to run along the edge of tedious and self-important. Movies about movies are the worst. If you want me to understand some other film before I see yours, buy me a ticket.

What keeps Young Frankenstein from being tedious is that some of the eternal pillars of comedy are present. There's lesson 5 -the running gag. Fred Frankenstein's horse snort whenever Frau Bl&uuml;cher's name is mentioned. Do it once, it's ominous, do it fourteen times and it's a running gag. Then there's lesson 6-Shtick. When carting the body of the about to be resurrected criminal through the town, have an arm pop out of the coffin just as the policeman comes by. Then have the hero pretend that it's his own as he does a long dialog with the cop.
Ah and Lesson 7: breasts. Ever since burlesque, there's the gorgeous, barely dressed creature as part of the comedy. In this case, it's Terry Garr who is both achingly beautiful and approachable. Ummm, maybe Lesson 7 is 'cast Terry Garr'.

If you are a lover of horror films who also has a sense of humor, this is probably one of the best movies ever made.

2601845,5,B000G6BLWE,"Although 'Blazing Saddles' is better remembered and 'The Producers' more critically acclaimed (Mel Brooks won an Oscar for the screenplay), Young Frankenstein is the best and the funniest film he has ever made. Its a wonderful comedic homage to the original James Whale films made back in the 1930's. So this is much more than just a parody. The original sets were recreated, in the same location, and the film is shot in black and white which brings back happy memories of Bride of Frankenstein (itself a black comedy).

Mel Brooks was very lucky to have Gene Wilder as leading actor for his best films. In the 1960's and 1970's Wilder was a comedy actor without peer. Effortlessly funny, and here right from his opening scene, at a teaching Hospital he's brilliant. The classic moment in this scene is his growing anger whilst holding a scalpel. Well you can guess what happens... Wilder does it with brilliant comic timing. Seeing the film again recently it struck me that Wilder would have made a great silent comedy star. Evidence of just how good Wilder was in this era, is that he even out performs the late Marty Feldman. The rest of the cast are nearly as good with Cloris Leachman and Peter Boyle both giving marvellous performances.

Gene Wilder also gets writing credits with Brooks as well and between them they produced a great script with a stream a great one-liners:

Frankenstein: Igor, would you give me a hand with the bags?
Igor: [doing a Groucho Marx] Certainly, you take the blonde and I'll take the one in the turban.

The DVD has some great extras, with the commentry by Mel Brooks being a particular highlight. Its both informative and funny. I haven't watched the documentary on the DVD yet. Overall this is a superb disc and a film that should be in everybodies collection.",1185667200,3,1800,4.722929936305732

Young Frankenstein (or shall I say, Fraaann-kenn-ste-e-n) epitomizes Mel Brooks humor with bouts of hilarity, absurdity, and down right slap stick laughs. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to dedicate a few hours to giggles and snickers, mixed with uproarious guffaws and a few, ""huh's?"" just to mix it up ! I can promise that you will be asking your friends and co-workers, ""Have you seen Young Frankenstein?"", which will result in instant laughter and an afternoon of ""quoting"" the flick with its inummerable ""good ones"".",1175731200,4,606,4.836538461538462
2601856,5,B000G6BLWE,"I love this film, which is without a doubt one of the ten funniest films ever created (and offhand, the other nine don't come to mind). YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is both an homage and a comic send-up of the 1931 and 1935 Universal Pictures classics FRANKENSTEIN and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (with some SON OF FRANKENSTEIN thrown in for good measure) in which an inspired director (Mel Brooks), an inspired screenwriter (Gene Wilder), and an inspired cast (Wilder as ""Dr. Fronkensteen,"" Teri Garr as his tasty Girl Friday Inga, Marty Feldman as the misshapen hunchbacked lab assistant ""Eye-Gore,"" Cloris Leachman as the cigar-smoking and violin-playing Frau Blucher, Madeleine Kahn as Dr. Frankenstein's uptight fiancee Elizabeth, Kenneth Mars as the wooden-armed Inspector Kemp who wears an eyepatch and a monocle on the same side, Gene Hackman as The Lonesome Blind Man, and Peter Boyle as the Monster) create the rarest of synergies onscreen.

Professor Frederick Frankenstein's acceptance of his birthright, and his transmutation throughout YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN from a respected American neurosurgeon to the Transylvanian noble, Herr Doktor Baron Frederich von Frankenstein, grave-robber and necromancer nonpareil, is an amusing echo of Colin Clive's ghoulish journey from dedicated Scientist to Mad Doctor, in which the humor of this movie becomes the honorarium paid to the earlier film.

YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is as funny today as it was in 1974 when it was released. A staple of the cable channels, it is incredible that a film seen so often can stay so fresh, but YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN has everyone involved contributing their finest skills at the peak of their powers. Although classed as a Mel Brooks creation, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN really belongs to Gene Wilder. His script maintains a perfect balance between pure silliness, dry wit, slapstick, and lowbrow humor, each finding it's own place and time within the film's reality---

---Igor's directions to ""Walk this way"" (at which point Wilder adopts his assistant's characteristically hunched and loping stance, staggering toward their nearby horse and wagon. This scene inspired Aerosmith to write their classic rock hit, appropriately entitled, ""Walk This Way."")

---The screaming of the horses at the mention of Frau Blucher's (""Mrs. Glue""'s) name;

---Gene Hackman's kindly but inept blind man's pouring of steaming soup into the Monster's lap and Peter Boyle's reaction (""How hungry you must have been,"" muses the oblivious Hackman);

---""Eye-Gore's"" ridiculous attempt at playing Igor to type, as in:

Igor---""There wolf. There castle.""
Dr. Frankenstein---""Why are you talking that way?""
Igor---""I thought you wanted to.""
Dr.---""No, I don't want to.""
Igor---""Oh, okay. Suit yourself. I'm easy.""

---Wilder and Boyle's unforgettable white-tie performance of ""Puttin' On The Ritz"" in front of the Transylvania Neurological Society (""For safety's sake, don't humiliate him!"")

Endless double entendre (""Elevate me."" ""Vhat? Here and now?"" ""Yes. Raise the platform."" ""Oh! Ze platform, ja, ze platform..."").

---(And my personal favorite) Cloris Leachman admitting that she set the stage for the creation of the monster, a la:

Dr. Frankenstein---""So you and my grandfather...you and he were...?""
Frau Blucher (screaming it)---""Yes! Yes! Say it! Say it! He vass my...boyfriend!""

Note if you will, the slight question in her tone at the end of her lines, as though asking if this is okay. I always end up howling with laughter at this moment, even though I've seen this picture at least 100 times. The entire film is crafted with moments like this, a jeweled net of pure comic genius.

Filmed in atmospheric black and white and borrowing the original lab equipment from James Whale's equally ageless now 77 year old film for dramatic effect, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN has unquestionably earned its place both as a classic comedy and as a classic in the monster movie canon on it's own merits. Brooks never topped this film. The closest contender in his oeveur would be BLAZING SADDLES, which, although inspired, relies too heavily on toilet humor to be a true classic. There are few other films made by anyone at any time, which have struck such pure comic notes.

In short, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN will never grow old.",1175385600,4,4249,5.322388059701493

Guess I would have been in high school at the time and I remember liking it a lot more then than I did this time around.  Not surprising, either. The humor is mostly pretty juvenile and predictable. There are, indeed, some funny bits in it (e.g., the horse whinnying every time they say the name of Cloris Leachman's character, Marty Feldman as Igor), but the sex jokes are pretty lame and trite, and the rest of the humor rarely made me laugh, just the occasional smile.

This movie is a work of comic perfection.",1171065600,2,320,5.469387755102041
2601860,5,B000G6BLWE,"YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN could well be the finest comic parody of a serious film ever made.  James Whale, whose dedication to German expressionist aesthetic ideals Brooks and Wilder emulated in this film, directed both the original FRANKENSTEIN and its even finer sequel THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN.  Gene Wilder had had the idea of doing a respectful parody of the Whale classics before he made BLAZING SADDLES and he approached Brooks with the idea of directing his script.  Most people I have asked about the film assume it is a Mel Brooks project from beginning to end, but it would be more accurate to describe it as Mel Brooks directing a Gene Wilder.  Of course, being Mel Brooks, he made more than his fair share of additions to the script, including many of the jokes, such as the famous Gene Wilder line ""What great knockers!"" he looks at the great doors of the mansion while his face is extremely close to Inga's chest.

The film is such a successful collaboration that the film represents the career highpoint or close to it for several of the principals in the film.  Although BLAZING SADDLES has to go down as Brooks's career peak since he wrote, directed, and acted in it, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is his next greatest film.  Gene Wilder has never come close to having a greater role than that of Dr. Frederick Frankenstein and though he has written other screenplays, nothing else remotely approaches this in terms of success.  Though we know the late, great Peter Boyle for other roles (such as his great Emmy-winning performance on THE X-FILES' episode ""Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose""), this had to be his finest hour.  Teri Garr is one of my favorite actresses, but this is always been her best role in my opinion (it is also the role that changed her from primarily a TV guest actress to a movie actress).  Though Cloris Leachman has had an amazingly diverse and varied career, this is easily one of her most memorable roles.  Finally, Madeleine Kahn had comparable roles in BLAZING SADDLES and WHAT'S UP DOC?, but she was never clearly better than she was in this film.  The one clear exception to all this is Gene Hackman, who has a small cameo and who has had, of course, a few dozen better roles than this.  His presence is welcome all the same.  In short, it is a film that made everyone in the project look very good indeed.  One additional actor I would like to mention is Richard Haydn, a great veteran Hollywood character actor.  Many will recall him as one of the scholars in BALL OF FIRE, Howard Hawks's take off on SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS.  Here he appears at the very beginning of the film as Gerhard Falkstein.

This is probably the last film Mel Brooks made in which very nearly every joke works.  What is remarkable is that they work as well today as they did in 1974 when the film first came out.  I suspect people will be laughing at it as hard 75 years from now as they do today.  The film has as many truly funny moments as any you could hope to see.  A host of the bits in the film have become classics, from Inga asking if Frederick would like to go for a ""roll in ze hay"" (she is being literal, not suggestive), to the horses neighing when they hear the name ""Frau Blcher,"" to the famous performance by Gene Wilder and Peter Boyle of ""Puttin' on the Ritz."" But the jokes can obscure what a slick production it is. Most people know that they used much of the equipment used in the original James Whale films, but even when they using completely original items the film does a masterful job of imitating the look of the old Universal projects.

In short, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is almost certainly assured of permanent status as a great comedy classic.  Having said that, I'm not certain that this great film has ever gotten the treatment that it has deserved on DVD.  I would love to see a definitive edition, with greatly expanded extras, better commentaries, interviews with the surviving cast members, and perhaps a documentary or two.  With most of the major surviving figures from the film either aging or ill, I would like to see this done sooner rather than later.  But even if this is the best we will ever get, this is definitely one of the classic comic films.",1171065600,3,4202,4.553191489361702

2601862,4,B000G6BLWE,"Young Frankenstein is a Mel Brooks movie.  How much more needs to be said?

I'm rating this one ""four"" because he did such a nice job of giving this satire/homage (hard to tell which it is) the look and feel of the Universal Studios classis.  Not only were the same sets used, but some of the lab props were brought of retirement from a museum.

In common with other Brooks movies:  Some of the cast members (and at least one of the gags).

Unique to this Brooks move:  it's in black and white.

Compared to other Brooks movies:  It reminds me of the television sit com Get Smart more than his other movies.

Rating his films, I put Young Frankenstein behind The Producers, on a par with Blazing Saddles, and ahead of Silent Movie.  (History of The World is a collection of short subjects that really needs to be evaluated individually - it compares to Woody Allen's Everything You've Always Wanted To Know About Sex more than any of Brooks' other films.)

If you aren't familiar with any of his other work, this might be a good starter.  As to just what is his work, well, er, uh, perhaps it's a blend of sight gags, plays on words, slapstick, satire, parody, and homage.  Perhaps this makes Mel Brooks a yenta with an education and a sense of humor.  But, I've always been a little meshuga (and I'm not even Jewish!), so you may want to rent this DVD before buying it (or watch a Get Smart rerun) and draw your own conclusions.",1169251200,,1429,4.400763358778626

Feldman is Dr. Frankenstein's henchman, Igor (pronounced EYE-GOR) and his mandatory hunchback changes from side to side in the film.  My favorite scene is when Igor goes to steal a brain for Dr. F's creation. In his ultimate genius bungling, he comes back with a brain from ""Abby somebody"", which leads to problems with the perfect monster, as one can imagine it would.

2601872,5,B000G6BLWE,"""Young Frankenstein"" is a 1974 Mel Brooks film, based loosely on the Frankenstein book and horror films. It's got a good reputation, but I didn't know what to expect really. I liked it though.

The ""Young Frankenstein"" is grandson of the original mad scientist, a professor of biology at an American university. He wants nothing to do with his grandfather's research, digging up bodies and bringing them to life, he thinks its a load of nonsense. On returning to his grandfather's castle in Transylvania, however, destiny compells him to take up the experiments again, and soon, he has re-animated a corpse, with the body of a giant man, and a brain belonging to an ""Abbie Normal"". That's what Eye-Gor (Marty Feldman) says, anyway. The townsfolk riot, the monster learns to dance, and a couple of love triangles develop.

I think this film works best as a tribute to old horror films with comedic elements rather than a straight up comedy. It's got great sets (some from the original Frankenstein film), great lighting, and those long periods of silence and minimal score that older films have. I haven't seen as many of the old horror films as I would like to, but I have seen enough to think this makes a good stylistic tribute. If you go in expecting something funny to happen all the time, you may be a little disappointed. Funny things definitely do happen (like the monster singing ""Putting on the Ritz"", the police chief's strange, mechanical movements, etc), but if you treat the film like some forgotten horror flick with some unexpected quirks it works a lot better, I think. The uncoventional comments and such come off a lot stronger this way, and perhaps this was the intention. As a comedy tribute to old films, I think this is one of the better ones, and I'd be picking this up before, say, a film like ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"", which was made a couple of years back.

Special features on the special edition include several deleted scenes, original theatrical and television trailers (narrated by Mel Brooks), outtakes, a commentary by Mel Brooks (whose audio sounds kind of aged), and a making of documentary with interviews from various crew members and Gene Wilder. He hasn't changed much, Gene, not really. They're all pretty interesting to watch.
