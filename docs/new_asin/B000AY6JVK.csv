2396392,5,B000AY6JVK,"Finally the long awaited updated Fat Free Yoga! And it was worth the wait. It will take me awhile before I can do the entire DVD. Right now I just do one of the four 20 minute sets and it is enough. I am hoping it will help me drop the 15 pounds that my doctor has recomended that I loose.

I have just been diagnosed with pre-diabetes and needed to start an exercise program. This DVD seems to be the right one.

I am so happy I found Ravi & Ana and am on Amazon right now to buy their Beginners and Beyond DVD.",1131667200,14,512,3.8666666666666667
2396393,5,B000AY6JVK,"Thank you Ana & Ravi for putting together another excellent Yoga workout! What I love about them is they have made this form of yoga completely non-mystical which is nice if you are new to yoga. There is some meditation at the end and it is a nice intro to this sort of thing.

The rest of the DVD is a well planned workout that is great for any level. It will work you out without wiping you out. Someone mentioned they did not sweat. Well I certainly did. But anyway, this type of workout is working on the metabolism, thyroid and glands for truly effective weight loss not just cardio which alone just does not work. Still, there is a good amount of cardio exercise. Just right for me.  Breath of fire, which feels pretty aerobic and gives me a nice relaxed energy, and good ab & leg work and toning. Upper body strength  The pace moves but not too quickly.

This DVD will certainly sooth nerves, work out some muscle knots and burn some calories. It is planned as 4 sets to do at once or seperately which is nice for time constraints.

I recommend you buy this one if you are looking for long term weightloss.",1131667200,30,1113,4.30622009569378
2396394,4,B000AY6JVK,"I did this DVD this morning and I really wanted to like it.  Maybe it will grow on me.  I don't see how you can lose weight on this, as I barely broke a sweat.  The only exercise that was hard were the yoga push-ups.  If done correctly, you really feel it.  Otherwise, I loved the meditation at the end.  Ravi asks you to feel sadness, fear and anger and then sing Sa Ta Na Ma after each emotion is concentrated on.  This one made me cry, which never happened before while doing a kundalini meditation. I really like that Ravi and Ana have taken the time to teach these meditations on their new DVD's.  This alone will keep them in my daily yoga rotation.  I gave it a four because weight loss--I don't think so.  Feeling good---you bet!",1131408000,10,737,4.237410071942446
2396395,5,B000AY6JVK,"High energy and lots of fun! Even though this DVD felt pretty challenging for me I really feel this is about as close to a perfect yoga workout as you can get. This is one I would like to do everyday because it seems to get everything covered from just enough stretching ( which opened my hips nicely and loosened up my spine) to cardio which, even though people would argure with me and say you can't get cardio doing yoga, made me feel totaly oxygenated. If anyone asked me if I did cardio today I would definitely say YES!

Here is a somewhat breakdown of the DVD as best as I can remember after doing this only 1X.

There are 4 parts. You can do them all together like I did or just 1 section.

The first exercise in the 1st section is called Ravi rolls which is quite interesting and got the heart pumping. You are standing and swinging your arms 1 & 3/4 circles one way then reversing, bending your knees as your arms pass center and doing breath of fire the whole time.

The 1st section (called Start Your Engines) continues with a lot of breath and

movement exercises for energizing. Side Bends and thyroid stimulating exercises that also really warm up and open up the upper spine. I think this section also had some warmups and stretching.

Set 2 is called Fight Fire With Fire which has a lot of deep abdominal work. At one point you are holding in a sort of half crunch position doing breath of fire and I felt the burn! This whole section is pretty intense for me. Other exercises in this section I can remember are a wide leg stretch, leg lifts on belly, leg lifts on back......

The next set is No-impact Aerobics. Walking in place knees high, then Frogs which always kick my butt, then piston pose which I am sure I will feel in my thighs and butt tomorrow.. Then there are these incredible looking pushups on one knee with the other leg straight behind which at first glance made me say ""no way!"" but I found I could do them. I might not have looked quite the same as Ana but I think it still worked the same important areas i.e. chest, back and arms and butt again! Then more arm work...

The last set is your life is in your own glands. Alternate leg lifts where you raise and lower your head opposite to your leg. Then there is breath of fire in cow and cat pose. Overall this last set seemed to be a shorter set though this is supposed to be four 19 minute sets. I will try to remember to time them next timeThen there are 2 meditations(for calming & emotional balance) which I skipped today for time

constraints though I will probably do them other times. I actually felt pretty calm and emotionally balanced by the end ot the workout anyway.

Overall it is a tough, energizing and refreshing workout and like most Kundalini yoga workouts contains no sun salutations which have begun to bore me beyond comatose!

The soundtrack is really well done. The music has an Indian flavor but mixed with other influences I can't quite recognize but really liked. You can hear Ana's breathing like she is right there in the room. it helped my breath of fire enormously to get into her rythym.

Ana is always an inspiration. She looks like she is having fun and smiles encouragingly making even the toughest sections seem easier. Ravi is off camera speaking. We never see him. He gives good aligment cues and as always emotional and spiritual support with his soothing voice.

Also in the credits before and after the workout you see Ana dancing which is really

cool.",1130371200,130,3481,4.410296411856474
2396396,5,B000AY6JVK,"First, I would like to say I had the old Fat Free which was good and effective but this one is so  heads and tail above that the old is going to ebay.

I have not always been the worlds most in-shape person which is probably what attracted me to the title the first time around.

Like the old one I found myself surprised by what I was able to do and felt pleasantly challenged throughout.

This one has some new exercises. Love the Ravi Rolls!  I find the whole workout very energizing. I love the victory dance Ana does at the end.

Though the workout is very physical, the mental, spiritual, emotional aspects of this work is inspiring. I would recommend this whether you want to lose weight or not. You will certainly make progress on your yoga journey whatever your level.",1129939200,10,777,4.398601398601398
2396397,5,B000AY6JVK,"Anyone who has doubts that yoga can effectively burn fat should buy this DVD.

You can feel the fat burning effects immediately.

I was pleasantly surprized by how energetic and vigorous sections were. It leaves me feeling so energized I am finding that I am even more active when I am not doing yoga and decide to organize, clean, paint, or receive friends rather then sit on the couch and watch oprah or sit around on the phone etc....

I have not had much prior yoga experience. My flexibility stinks and I hate to discourage myself in any way. But this is simply a great workout and I never am left feeling like a yoga reject!

This DVD is so much fun. Ana, dancing and smiling and having a great time demonstrating ,is the most inspirational fitness person I have ever seen. And Ravi does a great job explaining the exercises and giving insightful and delightful commentary throughout!

Together they keep the energy high.

This DVD is divided into four 19 minute workouts. Start Your Engines, Fight Fire with Fire, No Impact Aerobics, and Your Life is in Your Own Glands. You can do the whole thing or you can do the segments individually.

I can't give any weight loss results as of yet since this just arrived in my mailbox yesterday. But after 2 sessions my metabolism certainly feels revved and I feel terrific.",1129939200,19,1321,4.595744680851064

I love all of Ana's dvd's, so am trying this one, in hopes that it will help my thyroid function.  After just a few workouts with this dvd, my pants are suddenly so loose, I have to keep pulling them up.  (Yay!  Great side-benefit I was not expecting)!  I love all the great breathing exercises on this dvd, since I am trying to increase my lung capacity.  Also, since starting this dvd a week ago, I am sleeping much better.

I was looking for a yoga workout, not woowoo hippie crap with nonsense chanting and hyperventilating (what they call a breath of fire, which is a fancy way of saying to paint like a dog through your nose until you start blowing mucus everywhere).  I find chanting in words I don't understand to be ridiculous.  Words your brain doesn't know don't have magical abilities, so they essentially had me meditating on nonsense.  One of the exercises that's supposed to be good for the stomach actually triggered my acid reflux.  I can see how one would lose weight with this, between being light headed, grossed out, and having heartburn too bad to eat for the rest of the night. This is so bad it's going in the trash.  I can't even donate it with a clean conscience.",1453248000,,912,4.463855421686747
2396406,5,B000AY6JVK,I've had this dvd for several years.  I am not an avid yogi but I can do most everything on this dvd.  Quality is very good and music is just right.  Ana does all the poses and Ravi narrates the whole time.  Ana is very good and sometimes gets on my nerves because she is so good but that isn't her fault...lol!  The best part of this exercise dvd is that you get a break after every pose.  PERFECT!  It is my go-to yoga dvd when I want to begin exercising again every year.  Love it!,1452902400,,484,3.96875

I love how energized I feel after the first set and do this one often throughout the week when I'm short on time. Not only do I feel super charged and ready to take on my day after doing even just one of the sets on this DVD,  but all the sets are loads of fun! When I have more time I like to do the DVD all the way through and I feel like I get everything I need in a workout In terms of stretching, strengthening and cardio. As a bonus, Ravi and Ana have managed to make centering and meditation fly by. In fact, I'd say Kundalini is one big moving meditation. I love Ana! She's radiant and inspiring.

2396411,5,B000AY6JVK,"Love it. My first time doing Kundalini Yoga.

I also bought the Navel Power and Green Energy of the Heart DVDs by Ana and Ravi at the same time but haven't tried those other 2 yet.

I was confused at first as I couldn't find the 4 x 19 minute workouts described on the case, but then I realised that they are a mix and match thing and there are 4 main workout segments that you can combine with the pre and post workout items using the Matrix menu option. That's kinda neat.

I'm used to the stretchy kinds of yoga, and usually I prefer to move and breathe quite slowly. The breathing in these exercises is super fast but interspersed with moments of rest and meditation. Quite manageable.

So far I've tried the Start Your Engines segment with the warm ups. I must have missed the instructions on doing the breath of fire breathing in another track (I hope). It's pretty invigorating. The repetitive arm work reminds me of some Tracy Anderson workouts - no weights but it really fatigues your arm muscles. I

I enjoyed what I've tried so far. I look forward to trying more and using it as part of my morning routine before I start work (from home). Really helpful for mindset and motivation.",1445472000,,1192,4.424657534246576

The music that accompanies the movements is both relaxing and enlivening, Ana is easy to follow and Ravi's voice is soothing and I love that he explains what each movement is for, which organs or part of the body it helps, as someone who has had thyroid problems I found this particularly helpful.

2396413,4,B000AY6JVK,"I'm new to yoga, so I didn't know what to expect. I went through the whole thing and it was surprisingly difficult for me. I like that it has the Matrix menu so I can choose which sections to do, instead of having to do the whole video or do a lot of fast forwarding. I feel energized after I do this, and I can tell a difference in my body. The style of this video is a little weird though. There is a lot of meditating in this. I don't know if that's typical of most yoga routines, because I don't really have anything to compare it to. Personally, I don't care for all that. Since I feel so great when I do this, I'll try to overlook it. Overall, I like this video and will continue using it.",1439596800,,695,3.9714285714285715

2396418,5,B000AY6JVK,"I give this 5 stars BECAUSE
1. I've taken a 5 day meditation workshop recently and the instruction, language, energy and ""feel"" this video evokes really mirrored how I felt at some of the more peaceful yet energizing points during my workshop experience. In other words, it allowed me to re-experience some of the unique sensations I felt for the first time at that workshop which leads me to believe the instructors of this video are in the know and their exercise methods are authentic to the ancient, in tune ways.
2. The instructions were VERY easy and almost enjoyable to follow...no frustration there
3. The lady is not at all annoying. She is a passive model and it allowed me to really focus on the sequence of movements and my own experience.
4. It includes little explanations as you are doing the movements to make you understand what the movement is healing or stimulating within. The knowing helped my motivation to hold longer, less enjoyable movements and the overlap of quick talking moments with the actual exercise is good for efficiency. Plus you learn some neat ideas and concepts that you could reflect on later in the day or throughout the week during rough moments.
5. It's 100% doable for people at any fitness level. It's more about mind/body connectedness as opposed to a vigorous workout. It is a workout for the mind and spirit which I am learning...I've been neglecting due to the ""burn calories...as many calories as possible"" mentality. (although according to my fitness tracker, my heart rate was just as high doing this video as would have been on a light walk, so that's something for sure!).
5. Variety. I didn't get bored. If anything, I felt really intrigued by what was next. The pace is good.
6. It COMBINES meditation and yoga. It is really equal parts of both which is what I was looking for after learning to meditate. It would be excellent for someone who has tried meditation in the past and found it daunting to sit and do nothing for so long as the meditations are very short and broken up by yoga movements. It would be a great entry into longer, more deep mediations for a beginner. As it would be a great entry point for new yoga practitioners. A good branching off point or a great routine to stick with. I like the combination deal. A lot of breathing, stretching, strengthening and reflecting for the time you spend.

Now...let's see if regular practice of this video sees the results I want. I will try to come back to update in a month. I plan to put this into my cardio/weight lifting routine throughout the week at least once. I am also going to be doing some tai chi. :)",1433203200,12,2627,4.601279317697228

The exercises challenged me, and I felt I had a really good toning workout (especially from the No Impact Aerobics section). It's ideal for beginners, because after each exercise, there are meditations/rests (and you're gonna need them!) Ravi Singh's narration encourages you the whole way through. This workout is unique in that it nourishes your organs and glands, raises your metabolism, and activates your body's own ability to regulate fat (as opposed to a bootcamp which aims to burn more calories than you could ever consume). This workout encourages body awareness, relaxation, and joy. I am going to alternate it with another RaviAna DVD, to test its weight-loss potential, but regardless, it's such a joy to do, and you feel it doing your body and spirit so much good, that it's absolutely worth doing.",1397260800,8,888,4.966442953020135

I just bought Happy Hormones the other day and that is a great one, too! My mood was elevated for most of the day with that one. In my opinion, these are the best yoga DVDs out there. I love that they include meditations, too. These are the only workouts I've done that have resulted in some weight loss because I think they have such an effect on the glands and hormones, that one can change their eating habits more easily. My body also functions better and food seems to be digested better. I know some people who review these DVDs think the kriyas are ""weird."" If you're one of those people, please give these routines a chance to work their magic....at least a month. Don't be surprised if you suddenly find they're no longer weird but instead, some kind of MIRACLE. If you buy one DVD, I'd suggest Yoga Beauty Body or Fat Free Yoga Lose Weight and Feel Great. I think all the DVDs are great, but these routines are quite complete and will work all your areas in a short period of time. If you love to dance, though, Dance the Chakras is for you. Happy Hormones also has a dance component. ""May the long time sun Shine upon you, All love surround you, And the pure light within you, Guide your way on.""

I tend to do Denise Austin cardio workouts and the elliptical, and I'm flexible enough to do some of the crazy moves in this DVD.

The breathing that is involved is energizing and cleansing.  The movements will work your muscles, and also destress them.  I need to make more time to do this consistently, but the times I have done it, wow it felt like nothing else in a good way.  My six year old gets a kick out of the breath of fire, we laugh about it but man does it feel GOOD afterwards.  There is really good advice in some of the other customer reviews, namely for me:  1) try to do this on a fairly empty stomach  2) don't try to keep up with Ana, go at your own pace that's expected.  My dream is to do this daily when I retire!!!  haha  It really does feel like it has a very positive impact on your internal organs and their functioning.  I'm very sensitive to not hurting my knees or wrists or back due to arthritis, and this does not cause any undue pressure to those joints.

2396444,5,B000AY6JVK,I always tend to gain weight from November on and as my New Year's resolution I decided to do something about it. I decided to do this at least 3 times per week in rotation with my other Ana & Ravi DVD's. It's now been a month and a half I know this has worked for me because I've lost six pounds without eating that much different. My guess as to how it works is that it spikes your metabolism through its work on the glands. I also think that sometimes extra weight is emotional and this type of yoga clears that stuff right out.

I love that I'm not limping in pain when I'm done because some days you just need a good solid workout that won't take lots of psychological motivation just to turn it on. I find the results are fantastic and of course Ana and Ravi are so inspirational. One other thing about their workouts is that it is not catered to one belief system so it's very universal and non-religious; just good ol' feel-good exercise!

2396449,5,B000AY6JVK,I whole heartily disagree with the reviewer who said that Ana reminds her of Barbie. I'm somewhat limited in the kinds of exercise I can do and I'm eternally grateful to Ana and Ravi for making their amazing DVDs which are so well thought out and so caring for their audience. To me their words are not just yoga speak but come right from the heart and Ana is a gifted ATHLETE who inspires us all. This program has four short sets plus two meditations. You can mix and match so that you have here enough different workouts for a week. I'm already on my second copy of this (I wore the first one out) and counting.,1385424000,5,613,4.247863247863248

I hate watching Ana with her fake smile and especially the pointless opening and closing dancing. It felt like watching Barbie get her yoga on.

2396453,5,B000AY6JVK,"I am totally new to yoga. I like to work out, swim but never tried yoga. I finally cross my path with Yoga for beginners and ended up buying all 3 CD of Ana Brett. I started with Yoga for beginners and I have to tell you I do see much improved overall feeling. I have been hurting with herniated disk for many years. I work in the hospital and stay on my feet long hours. My back can get super stiff and painful. I like to do yoga right before bed. I do my work outs early in the morning, but I prefer yoga close to my bed time. That because I noticed they recommend most of the exercises to be done with closed eyes. By the time I am done with one CD I am just about to fall in sleep, but it is a weird feeling because my whole body is pumped up and super flexible but my eys and head is so rested and relaxed to the point of sleep mode. So I end up in bed and fall in sleep within seconds, sleeping SO GOOD that is unbelivable. If you think this yoga will make you sweat, this is not for you. The strength in these tapes are into the breathing cycle combined with lets say endurance type of exercises. Every exercise is very simple, but when you do it correctly and for the amount of time they want you to do, you will feel it is NOT so easy. If you master one position after what they say: Think of this that you can do it ALL DAY LONG - you will feel an amazing feeling. So anyway, I started every day with Beginner yoga, hard at the beginning, but getting easier day by day. Now I switched into Fat free Yoga and I LOVE IT! It is working you from the inside out which I love! My lower back got so much flexible and almost have NO pain all day. Amazing!",1382054400,4,1657,3.905325443786982

I admit I haven't done the other portions very often because I just love how I feel after those two. The breath of fire technique makes each exercise invigorating, and then the meditation and rest periods between each one are so relaxing. Sure the narration is a little cheesy, but you feel so good afterwards that it is a non-issue in my opinion. This is one yoga DVD that I just keep coming back to.",1381622400,2,686,4.2846153846153845
2396456,4,B000AY6JVK,"This review will have a two-part format. In the first part, I'll describe the contents of the DVD as well as my thoughts on them. In the second part, I'll say some more general things about Ana and Ravi and kundalini yoga. It seems the negative reviews of their DVDs come mainly from people who didn't know what to expect when ordering kundalini yoga DVDs -- because they ARE a little bit different from what you're used to, if you've only practiced hatha yoga in the past. I am unabashedly an Ana and Ravi fan, but hopefully my evaluation will help you make the correct decision for yourself, even if your opinion happens not to be the same as mine.

----------
Part I
----------

Like most of Ana and Ravi's DVDs, Fat Free Yoga has the matrix menu which allows you to customize the length of your workout. All exercises in this DVD are done equally on both sides of the body.

Breath Primer (4:32): Please note that this segment may not play if you just play the entire DVD through. It is accessible from the matrix menu and the chapter selection menu, however. If you are not familiar with kundalini yoga, you will definitely want to follow along here. It's actually a pretty good refresher for anyone who has practiced for awhile, as well. You learn how to do long deep breathing, a panting breath that serves as an introduction to breath of fire, and then a standard breath of fire technique.

Tune In (3:11): This segment is similar/the same in many of Ana's and Ravi's DVDs; you sit cross-legged, focus on your breathing, and chant ""ong namo guru dev namo"" three times.

Energizing Breath Exercise (4:28): Here, you inhale in 5 parts through your nose and exhale in 5 parts through puckered lips, all while clapping your hands together at navel level (but stopping when your hands are about a foot apart).

Start Your Engines (13:27): This is located on the DVD about where a warm-up would be on one of Ana's and Ravi's other DVDs.  However, it doesn't contain much in the way of the standard warm-up exercises I've come to expect.  Nonetheless, if you are tired of those, this might be a good DVD to try for some variety.  This segment consists of the following exercises:

*standing, circle your arms in front of you 1 and  turns, bending your knees as your arms pass center; done with breath of fire
*still standing, with your arms behind your head, lean side to side
*sitting, hold your arms up to the sides at 90 degree angles; inhale and turn your head left and straighten your elbows; exhale and turn your head right and bend your elbows again
*with your hands in a mudra (hand position), inhale arms up and exhale arms down (where the ""down"" position is with your elbows bent and resting against your sides)
*put your hands on your shoulders; inhale and move your elbows and head back; exhale and move your elbows and head forward/down
*relax on your back

For what it's worth, after a long day in front of the computer, I did this segment, and it really helped work some of the kinks out of my neck and shoulders.

Fight Fire with Fire (21:31): I have to stop here and say I don't care for the music in this segment.  If you've done Ravi's and Ana's ""Dance the Chakras"" DVD, this segment has the music from the ""victory dance"" segment in that one.  Over and over on an endless loop for more than 20 minutes.  It wasn't so bad there, but I don't like it here.  If you really like breath of fire, though, this part of the DVD is for you.  This segment consists of the following exercises:

*lying on your back, with one knee bent and the corresponding foot on the floor, hold the other leg up at a 90 degree angle and do breath of fire
*with your legs in the air and apart, hold inside your thighs and do long deep breathing
*on your stomach, do alternate leg lifts
*on your back and supported by your forearms, do alternate leg lifts again
*bow pose
*modified stretch pose; lie on your back and raise your head and one leg off the floor six inches (other leg is bent and foot is flat on floor)
*with feet flat and knees bent, lean back and hold inside your thighs; breath of fire
*modified locust pose with your hands together behind your back (I think there's another name for this that I'm not remembering)
*visualization in relaxation (corpse) pose

No Impact Aerobics (12:45): There's nothing really aerobic about this segment, in my mind.  However, on the day in front of the computer I mentioned earlier, I also did this segment and again, it was useful in working out some of the kinks in my neck and shoulders.  This segment consists of the following exercises:

*walk in place bringing alternate hands to your chest
*frog pose (start in the down position and straighten your legs); I have to go a lot more slowly than Ana does
*piston (sitting on your knees with your hands on your thighs, rise up and come down)
*push-ups on one knee with the other leg raised behind you
*stretch pose (lie on your back with your head and heels off the ground six inches)
*tuck pose (bring your knees to your chest and your head to your knees); I have to leave my head on the ground for this one because it bothers my neck a little
*sitting up, with your hands in a mudra, bend your elbows and touch them to your sides; raise alternate arms to 60 degrees

Your Life Is in Your Own Glands (11:37): This section has way too many medical claims for my personal taste.  If Ana's and Ravi's health advice works for you, great.  You'll probably really like this part.  But I am much more skeptical.  This segment consists of the following exercises:

*cow pose with breath of fire
*cat pose with breath of fire
*sitting, inhale in 16 sniffs and exhale in 16 sniffs
*on your back, inhale and raise one leg, exhale and raise your head while bringing the leg back down, inhale head down and alternate leg up, and repeat for awhile
*hug yourself (while sitting, hold your opposite upper arms with your hands), exhale down to the floor (or as far as you can go) and inhale back up

Deep Relaxation (3:11): This is similar in many of Ravi's and Ana's DVDs. Lie on your back, slow your breathing, and listen to Ravi.

Teapot Meditation (3:42): Sit cross-legged with your right hand wrapped around your left and the thumbs extended.  Breathe in through the nose and out through puckered lips, directing the breath between your thumbs.

Meditation to Transform Emotions (7:52): Sit with your hands palm up, one on top of the other, and your thumbs pointed out.  The idea here is that Ravi asks you to remember times you had certain negative emotions (you go through sadness, fear, and anger, in turn).  There are different breath patterns involved.  Then, after you've dwelled on each emotion, you say ""Sa Ta Na Ma"" 8 times and move on to the next emotion.  The idea is to acknowledge these feelings and then overcome them.  I'm not sure how I feel about the results of this, but I haven't given it a whole lot of time, to be fair.

Closing Prayer (2:24): This is similar to what appears in other Ravi/Ana DVDs.

For those of you familiar with Ravi's and Ana's DVDs, this is one of the ones with the pink circle rug and flower pattern on the floor, the white background, and dark-haired Ana. I've noticed a lot of the music in those overlaps, as do some of Ana's outfits. Both Ravi and Ana narrate and Ana demonstrates the poses and movements. This DVD has very little mantra chanting (performed by the participants at home) other than the ""tune in"" and ""closing prayer"" sections and a small amount in the ""Meditation to Transform Emotions"" section.  The DVD is unusual in that there are two meditations, though, and TONS of breath work.  So if either of those appeals to you, you might really like this DVD.

One warning: sometimes doing too much cat/cow every day, for a long period of time, can cause my wrists to hurt a bit. So if you have wrist issues, don't do the ""Your Life Is in Your Own Glands"" segment every day.

Other than the issue I had with the music in the ""Fight Fire with Fire"" segment (see the discussion of that segment above), I liked the music all right.  If you've done other ""dark-haired Ana"" DVDs, it's similar here to some of the other ones.  The camera work is a little obnoxious at times.  For example, there is a tendency to focus on odd things (like Ana's knee, then her thigh, then half of her torso).  Mostly, though, this doesn't interfere with following along.

I think this is probably not my very favorite DVD that Ravi and Ana have put out (I have about 2/3 of their DVDs), but I still rate it very highly. I'm going to say this might be good for beginners because there aren't a lot of difficult, extended stretches.  However, be prepared for a lot of breath work; do follow the ""breath primer"" segment a couple of times and get familiar with everything if you are new to kundalini yoga. Ana and Ravi do offer some suggestions for modifications of certain poses. And don't forget -- you don't have to keep up with Ana. Work at your own pace.  Take breaks if you need to.  (I consider myself intermediate/advanced and I still go way slower than Ana in some sections.)

----------
Part II
----------

Now, on to a more general discussion of kundalini yoga in general, and Ana's and Ravi's DVDs in particular.

Most of the yoga that people are familiar with falls under the umbrella of hatha yoga. Perhaps you've done a series of static poses, or some vinyasa/flow yoga. Kundalini yoga is not exactly like either of these, although Ana's and Ravi's DVDs do incorporate elements of hatha yoga (e.g., this DVD has a lot of traditional poses like cat, cow, bow, and locust in it). However, kundalini yoga is also what I would consider to be a very active form of yoga, consisting of some repeated movements and a lot more work with the breath than you may be used to. It can be difficult to keep up with at first, but can be very rewarding if you stick with it.

If you are bored of holding static poses all the time, or if you want a bit more movement but hate vinyasa (sorry, but I am not a fan of flow yoga), kundalini might really work well for you. And, as I said earlier, use the modifications Ana and Ravi discuss if you need to use them. Yes, Ana is fit (and this makes her an excellent demonstrator for the poses), but this is not a competition. Don't strain yourself, and don't try to keep up with her. Just try to improve a little bit every time!

Kundalini yoga also involves a lot of meditation. Sometimes this is quiet and involves breathing either in a sitting position or lying down, occasionally with your hands in a mudra (hand position). Sometimes it involves chanting a mantra. This DVD does not contain a whole lot of chanting. Whenever there are mantras, though, Ana and Ravi tell you what they mean. If you are uncomfortable with mantras for religious reasons, check out Ana's and Ravi's website (can't post links in reviews but they're easy to find through Google) for alternatives.

With respect to calorie-burning, this is probably not the sort of program that will make you shed a ton of weight, despite the ""Fat Free Yoga"" name. What it is good for, is improving working out stiffness and kinks in both your upper and lower body (which is great in the morning or after sitting for a long time). And as a physical activity, it may burn some calories and strengthen some parts of your body. If you haven't exercised in awhile, it may be more challenging for you than it was for me.  For my own part, I still do plenty of pretty intense cardio at other times of the day.

Ana's outfits are a bit skimpy, but certainly nothing less than you would see at the beach. And the reason she dresses like she does is so that you can really see her performing the movements and asanas. That way you know exactly how to position yourself for maximum benefit. (Most of the time, kundalini yoga is done with the eyes closed, anyway.) There is not a lot in the way of initial instruction in this DVD. If you are familiar with Ana's and Ravi's work, you can jump right in. But if you are new to kundalini yoga, watch it first. Observe Ana, listen to the cues, make sure you understand. You'll be glad for the lack of excessive instruction later -- you don't want to be told on the 20th time you do a DVD how to do frog; you know it by this point!

I mentioned the health claims earlier; I feel the need to revisit that aspect at greater length here.  I think Ana and Ravi give great advice when it comes to muscular and skeletal issues.  I am less trusting of their advice regarding glandular issues.  They do include a disclaimer at the beginning that the health claims come from traditional sources.  I'm skeptical of claims that certain exercises reduce problem areas, eradicate love handles, stimulate the thyroid, etc.  But I have had an extensive (Western) education in the sciences and I am naturally skeptical.  At any rate, certainly don't use yoga as a substitute for seeing the doctor. But doing a routine like this isn't likely to hurt you or make your health condition worse (as long as you PACE YOURSELF).

If you are struggling with a pose, or don't feel there's an adequate explanation, Ravi and Ana are very accessible and quite nice. They have contact information on their website (the URL is on the DVD case) and usually get back to you in a couple of days. They also have a monthly e-mail newsletter that I enjoy.",1381536000,8,13369,4.476327706875257
2396457,5,B000AY6JVK,"My hubby and I do this work out next to the fire in the winter time. Its a great work out, and really just completely different from the ashtanga, iyengar beginnings that many fitness nuts have become a custom to at their local gyms.

The breath work is excellent and I felt younger with each passing week.  Kundalini most definitely has an eastern flare, and some of the chanting could be offensive to fundamentalists, but if you are just looking for a fun work out that makes you laugh and feel sexy this is it!

works but it does. I think it's because this style of yoga (Kundalini) works so much on providing a hormonal boost. My energy is better,
my sleep is deeper, and my sex drive is better too! That kind of stuff is only the tip of the iceberg. Whenever I do this one my emotions

It's a perfectly paced workout that leaves me feeling uplifted and refreshed.

What makes their DVDs so extraordinary is a combination of the pacing, the demonstrations/explanations, and the affirmations they share throughout. I find myself using the mantras they've taught me throughout my day, alleviating stress with the breathing techniques they use in the video, and reminding myself to ""do my best and be so blessed.""

It seems that many people who have had a low or over active thyroid have found relief through this DVD. I was dubious to say the least. Doctors will tell you, and they told me, that after a certain point your thyroid stops producing hormones and after that it's pretty much down hill, unless you take a thyroid supplement, but that can be dicey as well.

While very effective, there are more modified poses, especially in regard in the core work, than some of the other practices by RaviAna.  You can do the entire 90-minute practice or use the matrix to create a shorter practice.  The teapot meditation alone is worth the price of the DVD.  I will frequently use the matrix option to have the teapot meditation loop several times because it is so soothing and easy to do.  ""Your Life Is In Your Glands"" is my favorite on the DVD, although all the segments are wonderful, because I feel this area of my body is so important and needs to be worked on regularly.",1360281600,4,680,4.540983606557377

You really get your heart pumping and feel just awesome by the end of the workout.  I recently got inspired by hearing other people's New Year resolution of doing 40 days of one of Ravi and Ana's DVDs. I chose my favorite workout - Fat Free, and after just 2 days in a row I already feel transformed!  Who knows, I may not want to stop in 40 days!

2396481,5,B000AY6JVK,"Let me say that I was a bit skeptical about Kundalini yoga after having a bad experience at a Yoga studio.  I am a die hard Power Yogi fan so this was a little out of my element.  I can say that I am really pleasantly surprised by these DVDS.  I bought these DVDS because I was feeling fatigued and run down and having difficulty losing weight.  I felt my energy was stagnant and that no matter how much aerobic exercise I was doing the weight just was not coming off as quickly as it used to.  While I could just slough it off to getting older, I decided that perhaps all the years of accumulated stress had finally taken a toll on my body and I needed to do something different.  I needed to move the stagnant energy and unblock areas of my body that perhaps has been affected.  I was also interested in what another reviewer had written about the section on ""Your Life is In Your Own Glands"" for fertility as well as the Dr. Yoga House Call DVD.  Some reviewers have criticized the breathing exercises as silly or them not breaking a sweat in general.  While this is true, you will not be holding poses for a long time to build up heat as in Ashtanga or Power Yoga, the breath of fire is very effective for moving stagnant energy (prana).  You may not break a sweat, but you will definitively find yourself ""panting"". The main breathing technique ""breath of fire"" is indeed aerobic (literally meaning ""with air"") and will burn calories whether or not you are breaking a sweat.  It also detoxifies the body and brings oxygen to the blood and vital organs.  The section on the glands on this DVD focuses on the Thyroid and Pineal glands which are master glands for sex drive, hormones, and you guessed it....metabolism!  So, I get the same benefit with some extra bonuses without having to jump all around.

Here are some of the things I have personally noticed after using the DVD:

1) My breathing is now slow, deep, even and steady.  Most of us don't breath evenly out of both nostrils, usually one is dominant.  Just try breathing onto a hand mirror and see. Also, when we are stressed, breathing usually becomes shallow and restricted. But after doing these exercises I noticed a difference for the better in the way I breath.

2) I'm sleeping better and not getting up in middle of the night to pee.

3) I feel like I am vibrating, alert, and energized afterwards, practically buzzed on oxygen.

4) I am losing weight (combined with change of diet of course).

I love the Matrix because you can customize your own work out which is helpful if you are short on time or want to break it up into two or more shorter sessions.  Personally, I like to break it up into 2 x 30-40 minutes sessions.  Doing it all at once would be pretty intense.  Fortunately within the sections, there are short rests/meditations which I actually like.  Just because you are not doing jumping jacks does not mean this is not intense.  Working with energy, breath, and moving prana should be done with care.

The sections are as follows:

Primer 4:28
Tune In 3:11
Energizing Breath Exercises 4:28
Start Your Engines  13:27
Fight Fire With Fire 21:31
No Impact Aerobics  12:45
Your Life is In Your Own Glands 11:37
Deep Relaxation 3:11
Teapot Meditation 3:42
Meditation to Transform Emotions 7:52
Closing Prayer 2:24

I find that the sections flow so easily from one to the next that I don't necessarily notice.  On some DVDS the transitions can be counter intuitive and choppy.  Not so with this DVD.  The meditations are divine!  Very different than traditional meditation, but using breath in such a different but effective way.  I especially liked the Teapot meditation.  I really have a hard time sitting still and doing nothing in mediation, and I'm not much of a chanter, but I found these sections very interesting and doable.

It is very different from traditional ""working out"" or sun salutation down ward doggy yoga.  If you can keep and open mind and notice what is happening to your breath and energy, essentially your life force, I think you will be very pleased with the results.",1353196800,23,4075,4.568275862068965
2396482,5,B000AY6JVK,"I was on the site looking for another DVD from Ana and Ravi and thought I'd leave a review for my favorite Yoga workout. I bought this DVD 5 years ago. I love it and while I bought other DVDs from them, this one remains my favorite. When I don't feel like working out, I know if I get through the DVD, I will feel better at the end and more energized.

The reasons I love this workout:

1.) The workout makes me feel fit, happy, and balanced.

2.) I vary my workouts (aqua, weight lifting, spin classes, circuit training and yoga/pilates). Sometimes, when I hit a wall in my other classes, I remember Ravi's voice cheering me and saying ""The part of you that says no but the more enduring part of you says go. Let that voice be your counsel"". It is very nice to get through some other difficult situations as well.

3.) As I mentioned, I have had this DVD for a while and I look forward to it each time. I am not bored of it at all and truly enjoy the workout.

Buy this DVD without hesitation. I am going to try their other workouts as well.

I also have dance with chakras and this one http://www.amazon.com/Navel-Power-Kundalini-Singh-Brett/dp/B0006VY6JY/ref=pd_sxp_grid_pt_1_0.

I love this one the most. The navel power is my second favorite. I just never got into it as much as this one.

I've gotten my energy back and my skin has improved and my eyes are brighter. I'm also sleeping more deeply. It may be my imagination, but when I look in the mirror I could swear that my muscle tone has improved. I know that what makes this type of yoga (Kundalini) special is its work on the glands. I cannot express how grateful I am for this DVD coming into my life. Forget about the fact that the type of exercises in this DVD are a bit different than what you would expect in yoga. What matters is that it has worked wonders for me. Ravi and Ana, thank you a thousand times for making this.",1350864000,10,903,4.107344632768362

But my issue has always been consistency.....until now that is!!! I am so grateful to Ana & Ravi for designing this DVD. It is a workout for sure, but doable and enjoyable enough to do daily. The music is some of the best I have heard on a workout DVD. In this program Ana does all the demonstration (admirably so!) and Ravi does the voice over, which is incredible as well. I often feel, even after the 100th run through that he is talking directly to me! I have lost 17 lbs over the last few months. My stomach area is flatter and this may sound odd coming from a yoga practice, but my confidence and self esteem have really sky rocketed.

2396487,3,B000AY6JVK,"I need everyone to listen to my review carefully. I am a very fit man by most people's standards. I have always got compliments on my body. I run, lift weights and perform ab exercises that keep my body pretty proportioned. I am not the type to gloat about my body...it took a lot out of me to even say the things I just mentioned about my body. For the sake of an honest review I need to be candid and brush my personal feelings aside.

My wife purchased this yoga video because she learned from a coworker that the video is good for back pain. I always heard about yoga and never tried it because I thought that it was an exercise for women and weak men. I viewed my weight lifting and running and ab workouts supreme to yoga. When my wife plopped in the DVD I decided to join her and see what this is about and be a supportive husband and do things with my wife as an encouraging ploy to keep her motivated.

HELL IS WHAT I GOT MYSELF INTO!!

My flexibility was put to the test. Relaxing positions while sitting in the yoga poses killed my pelvis region. Had me gasping for God to administer divine intervention on the burning sensation in my jock and pelvis region. My wife's flexibility was much greater than mine in the sitting poses. I SUCKED to say the least. I periodically found myself pulling out of poses due to the burn in my pelvis and jock area. NO WORKOUT IN MY LIFE has challenged me like this video has. This yoga DVD is very effective to say the least!

I have been doing this Yoga video for some time now and I can admit that I am getting better. Breathing is very important while doing the workouts.

Things I don't like about the video:
1. The lady dancing in the beginning is a deception. This video will not make you feel like dancing. You will be pushed like you have never been pushed.
2. The lady on the video has a creepy look on her face during the beginning meditations. She is okay until she opens her mouth and all goes south from there.
3. Ana's toes curl inward on certain poses and makes her look possessed
4. The breathing in and out is overkill. I found myself getting headaches with all that heavy breathing. Ana's breathing sounds like sandpaper against a wall. There is something really awkward about that type of heavy breathing.
5. The music and the voice of Ravi does not fit the intense workout.
6. Ravi, the voice on the video sounds like he is doing something in the studio that he isn't supposed to be doing (just my opinion).
7. The music sounds pornish if you know what I mean. Doesn't match the intense workout.

Aside from those cons the workouts are great. I just try to ignore Ravi's voice and not pay too much attention to Ana's weird looks.

All I do is yoga now and my wife and I are purchasing other yoga DVD's that don't focus too much on the prayer meditation stuff and focus more on the workouts.",1342051200,6,2856,4.287569573283859
2396488,5,B000AY6JVK,"I'm not new to Kundalini Yoga as I have been working with Maya Fiennes Detox and De-stress, Chakras and Mantras series. I love Maya Fiennes workouts and didn't think they could be topped.  I was aching to find other KY DVDs to enhance my practice and was drawn to Raviana based on the great reviews they received.

I must confess I have only had this DVD for one week but I have completed the whole 90 minutes EVERY DAY.  I am feeling the benefits already, more from a spiritual/psychological perspective, but I feel much more myself and calmer.

The best thing about this DVD are the two meditations: The 'Teapot' one does help with stress and anxiety.  The other one (can't recall the name) is great for shifting emotional blockages.  You are encouraged to visualise 3 emotions: anger, upset and fear and with the SA TA NA MA meditation you are encouraged to let go.  When I first did this, I certainly let go as I was in tears when recalled a traumatic event.  However, as I chanted the mantra, the feelings of upset were being replaced with bliss.  Now, any upset that I experience gets the SA TA NA MA treatment and I feel better for it, already.

A few reviewers have commented that Ravi and Ana are 'weird'.  I would say give it a chance and actually complete the workout: when your eyes are closed you feel encouraged, soothed and blissful.  I watched the DVD before doing it and felt a bit weirded out but, because, I have done kundalini before, I knew it would be fine.  In fact, I would suggest that some of these reviews are completed by people reluctant to engage with the workout. Regarding the comments about Ana's attire: do not let this put you off as, if you are doing the workout properly, you will not be gazeing at her for the duration of the workout. Ana is kitted out in vest and hotpants and I find this useful for checking if I'm performing an exercise correctly.

With regard to weight loss and the fat free element: a week is too soon to comment but I feel more confident that I can stick to a healthy eating regimen.  I will update later with if I experience any significant weight loss.

I would recommend that people give this DVD a go and to leave their prejudices at the door as it could be life changing.",1337040000,5,2237,4.406326034063261

I ended up going through the whole thing in one go and my honest opinion is that I wish it had been a bit more challenging. I think this workout is great for those just beginning yoga, or who are just getting into exercising. Don't get me wrong, the routines made me sweat! But I just didn't feel it was challenging enough to be fun and interesting and very useful. I do not think I will be using this routine again and will try to opt for a bit more of a challenge next time. I also want to add, though, that this was very wonderfully designed. I love the voice over and the way Ana Brett demonstrated the moves. I also loved how every workout was always followed by a meditation. I thought that was a great juxtaposition. I would definitely recommend this workout to beginners, but perhaps for more advanced practitioners of yoga and exercising, another dvd may work better.",1336521600,9,939,4.402298850574713

5th year with ""Fat Free Yoga"" since beginning of 2009!

Still very effective.

A Suggestion for ""Real Experimentation in Powers of Yoga""
specially for Ana Brett and Ravi Singh!

( If Ana Brett did her ""Yoga Poses"" decently dressed, she would be even more effective.
And their Videos would sell even more, bringing more business to them.)

2396491,5,B000AY6JVK,"A lot of people have done a great job of explaining and breaking down the contents of this DVD, so I won't review it from that point of view. I do think that this DVD deserves all the starts in the firmament and I want to add my five. :)

I see a few reviews focusing on the perceived low rate of exertion with these exercises. See, that is part of the genius of this DVD.

What many people don't know is that the reason ""regular"" aerobics are effective in inducing weight loss is because of the additional supply of oxygen to the cells as we breathe harder. You are not burning fat because of the exertion or exhaustion you are experiencing, you are burning fat because of the increased oxygenation. It is a complicated mechanism but, in a nutshell, oxygen burns fat. The breathing patterns taught in this DVD, combined with the exercises, accelerate oxygen consumption and delivery to the cells -- because of this, as Ravi says: ""it can be said that breath of fire is more aerobic than aerobics"".

Another thing that some people don't get is that, no matter how little you eat or how much you exercise, weight control will always be a challenge for you if your thyroid gland doesn't work efficiently. This DVD has exercises to optimize thyroid function.

For those who buy into the ""no pain no gain"" approach to fitness, let them knock themselves out and harm their joints with high impact aerobics. As for me, I am sticking with kundalini yoga.

I have many kundalini yoga DVDs which I rotate for my daily workouts (all 22 released by Ana and Ravi plus others by Maya Fiennes, Yoga Girl and Gurmukh) and I keep debating between this one or Navel Power (also by Raviana) as to which one is my absolute favorite. Besides the relative ease and high effectiveness of the exercises, I adore the beautiful meditative content delivered in Ravi's soothing voice. The music is stunning, relaxing and mysterious. I truly wish Ravi and Ana considered returning to this type of music for future DVDs instead of the noisy ethnic fusion racket pumped out in their blonde Ana DVDs.

Do yourself a favor and get this DVD.",1334361600,26,2108,4.5782493368700266

I have a few other DVDs of Raviana's (old and new) and this is by far the best for overall well-being.  If you're a beginner, you can do this DVD.

2396496,5,B000AY6JVK,"I bought several of the Ravi Yoga DVDs upon the recommendation of my daughter, who is in great shape (snowboarder, raft guide, outdoorsy type) and was using the ""boot camp"" DVD and really liked it.  I listen when my daughter recommends something, because she is very picky about products.  The Fat Free Yoga DVD is a wonderful DVD for beginners or advanced Yoga folks -- I'm a 50+ woman who has been sick with low thyroid function, joint pain, and other health problems for several years.  This DVD is one of the first Yoga DVDs I've seen that makes it easy to do Yoga no matter what shape you're in.  I can't touch my toes, I have very little flexibility, and my health problems keep me from doing most Yoga asanas right now.  But if you can't sit cross-legged, you can sit in a chair.  If you can't do the exercises as fast as Ana, you can slow down or do part of the exercises.  This is Kundalini Yoga, which means that breathing exercises are a big part of the DVD. I can barely lift my arms up repeatedly and do the exercises, but I can feel the effects of the practice already (it's only been a few days that I've been using it!).  But if you're in great shape, I could see how these Yoga breathing exercises helping you to maintain your wonderful health. I bought several of the DVDs and can see that I'll be using these for years to come.  Highly recommended.  Ravi's voice is a little annoying at times, if you find yourself reacting badly to what I call the ""calming Yoga voice,"" meant to be peaceful and calming and relaxing, but is instead somewhat annoying at times -- it's not something that should keep you from getting the DVD, however, because it's a very minor annoyance. Any of you who also recognize the ""preacher"" voice on Sunday TV shows and are annoyed by that type of voice quality will know what I mean. But I can't listen to talking books because I get annoyed by the voice quality of most readers, so I'm sure almost everyone will think Ravi's voice is just fine.",1327363200,5,1990,4.383152173913044

3. I was told by a doctor that I should have my thyroid removed and be on medication for the rest of my life. After two months of doing this 3 or 4x per week my thyroid levels have stabilized for the first time in many years!
4. the first month I started doing this regularly I lost 6 lbs. and my slimmer thighs and upper arms prove to me that it wasn't just water weight.
5. this DVD has 4 approx. 20 min. segments, so that if you're time constrained you can pick and choose
6. This has some cardio, weight bearing, stretching, and ab work.
7. The meditation for the emotions has made a huge difference in my outlook.
8. Instead of paying $20 for a yoga class I can just do this. It's like a class in my den. This is the best 11.99 I every spent!

2396499,5,B000AY6JVK,"The DVDs by Ana Brett and Ravi Singh are a gift to the human race, especially those of us living in Western societies. Viewers of all ages, body types, and physical condition can benefit from the transformative alchemy presented within.

In addition to the physical benefits of this yoga practice, there are mental, emotional, and spiritual benefits arising from repeated viewings and continued practice.

My perspective is that of a 62 male with a lifetime interest in fitness, mental well being, happiness and spiritual development. I have purchased and used regularly for several months eight of their DVDs. My life has been changed very positively as a result. I feel better, more flexible, and more energetic. I have more stamina, am calmer, more centered, and most importantly, more open to possibilities in my life.

Unlike many other yoga DVDs available, these use simple interior studio sets without the distractions of an exotic beach, stark desert, or lush tropical locations. The music is varied and thoughtfully chosen for the particular exercise. Ravi's soothing voice is uplifting while instructional. Most yoga poses are easy to follow, simple to do, and generally are NOT the pretzel bending type. The meditations and chanting are interesting and enjoyable additions to the physical practice, and I believe would not offend devout practitioners of Christianity or any religion.

I recommend these DVDs without reservation, and urge you to give this gift to yourself. But then, don't let it sit on your shelf. Create the habit of frequent, if not daily practice, for it is in this way that you will experience the transformative power therein.

The greatest gift that I have received from watching and practicing yoga with these DVDs is a better ability to view life's never ending challenges as possibilities for positive change.

Thank you so much, Ravi and Ana.

I have bought 4 copies of Fat Free Yoga this Christmas for gifts because this (borrowed from a friend) was my first introduction to Ravi & Ana's amazingly effective style of yoga and I feel like this yoga is so life changing, I want everyone I know & love to experience it! Be aware of the fact that Kundalini is not your regularslow class yoga. It's faster paced - you will move and burn calories and breathe a lot too - but it is totally doable, totally fun, and you will feel absolutely wonderful.

2396504,5,B000AY6JVK,"About three months ago I decided to try ""Kundalini"" style yoga after a long established Hatha yoga practice.  I found an awesome teacher and fell in love with this style.  The problem is, I live in a very remote area, the closest Kundalini yoga class is a 50 mile drive.  I looked on line and found Maya Fiennes, Gurumukh and these guys' Dvds.  I bought them all.  They are all good.

I came to prefer the Ravi Singh, Ana Brett Dvd's because of their matrix option.  It allows you to build your own practice out of their kriyas.  Doing it this way you can even repeat sections for a longer work out or skip sections if you would rather not chant mantras etc.

I have their ""Yoga for Flexibility"", ""Journey through the Chakras"" and this Dvd.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that if you are used to Hatha Yoga dvds it's kind of startling how much time in meditation and breath exercises is on Kundalini dvds.  Nonetheless, it's still a great workout.  I have a lot a strength and flexibility from practicing kundalini.

One reviewer mentioned that she hurt her back.  As a yoga teacher myself, I recommend you use these videos to supplement your training with a live teacher - not to replace a real teacher.",1314489600,3,1215,4.463636363636364

Another thing is I HATE working out. Can never get myself out of bed to exercise. But this is FUN!! I Love it. I even wake up an hour earlier just so I can try to do the whole thing.

I'm not that much into chanting, etc. So with the ""Matrix"" menu I just skip the chanting and meditation parts and do the workouts.

Man, it does not look like a workout but it works your whole body. I feel amazing every time. I love love love it. Totally hooked on Yoga and now I feel like I can actually make a difference with my body and stick to a routine.",1311811200,9,750,4.02013422818792

It's a great way to start a new workout routine. I ordered it sometime last week and received it by the end of the week. Last night was the first time I tried it. Each workout is 19 minutes long, you can do all four and the meditations or schedule them to your own needs and time. I highly recommend doing all four because the time goes so fast, I dint even realize the time. The music is great, and when you feel like you can't go on, they help you breath and it feels fantastic. Today I'm a little sore, but it's a good type of sore the only way I can explain it is the way you feel the next day after getting a deep tissue massage. I'm looking forward to doing it again. :) It also helps you understand how certain positions helps certain parts of your body, I like that.
P.S. By the way I'm not the thin, flat tummy, girl, I have a two year old, a job, and a hubby to take care of. I put on alot of weight during my pregnancy and this is a start to my weight loss journey, and I have never been happier about a workout.",1310342400,8,1200,3.9221311475409837
2396513,5,B000AY6JVK,"I really love this DVD. A few years ago, I started trying to get in shape and bought many exercise DVDs. I loved this one the most -- and was inspired to try more of Ravi Singh & Ana Brett's videos. I kept coming back to this one.

What I like about this DVD is the type of exercise (kundalini yoga) as well as the variation in intensity of the exercise.
I love the type of exercise because oxygen is incorporated as a crucial part and oxygen is so rejuvenating. After doing this on a daily basis for awhile, I started noticing how much more youthful my skin looked.
I also like the stretches. The first time I do one, it is hard to keep up -- but a few sessions later, I find myself hitting pause just to hold the stretch longer. Who knew how good these stretches could feel?

My favorite feature of the DVD is the ""customize-your-workout"" feature. It is nice to be able to control the intensity of the work-out. I usually skip the ""tune-in"" exercise, but I would recommend that to anyone just starting. I always start with the ""energizing breathing exercise"" and, if pressed for time, I follow that with ""start your engines"" and ""fight fire with fire."" That is my condensed workout, and it always makes me feel great. It isn't too intense, but is a very energizing workout.  When I have more time, I do all the workouts... though sometimes I skip the meditations. However, other times I do only the meditations. That's why I love this DVD, its an all-in-one, and caters to the viewer.

It is also a very positive DVD with uplifting messages throughout. Ravi Singh is pretty good at those words of encouragement.

Honestly, I don't think its possible to oversell this DVD. It is truly amazing, but you get what you give. For me, I began to realize that it was slowly reshaping my body, and giving me energy, rejuvenating my skin, and making my life feel supercharged -- this fueled my desire to incorporate this workout into every day of my life. For some yoga is an exercise, for others it becomes a way of life...  this has changed my life and become a way of life. However, even if you don't fall in love like I have... it is a solid exercise DVD.",1309219200,20,2151,4.391959798994975

I started doing this DVD (based on the authors' recommendation) 3 times per week, rotating it with their other titles. Almost immediately I started to see excellent improvements on all fronts. The way this workout makes me feel inside also led to lifestyle breakthroughs. I love Ana & Ravi's caring attitude and the way they design their workouts for all fitness levels.

2396520,5,B000AY6JVK,"First, there is some confusion about the name of this workout.  Although this DVD is often referred to shorthand as ""Fat Free Yoga,"" instructors Ana Brett and Ravi Singh actually released several different DVDs under the Fat Free Yoga series, all with different subtitles (i.e., ""Fat Free Yoga:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Total-Tune-UP/dp/B00012FNBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga Total Tune-UP</a>"" and ""Fat Free Yoga:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Cleanse-Lighten-Up-Purify-with-Ana-Brett-Ravi-Singh/dp/B00012FNB8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga Cleanse - Lighten Up & Purify - with Ana Brett & Ravi Singh</a>"").  Also, this particular DVD is actually a REMAKE of the original Fat Free Yoga - Lose Weight & Feel Great which was released on VHS in 2003.  That version, although it showed Ana on the cover, did NOT feature Ana performing the exercises; instead another model, Catherine Quinn, accompanies Ravi's voice-over narration.

I had tried the original years ago, but I am thrilled to have finally discovered this updated version!  Although the basic workout is the same, the overall look and feel of this DVD is definitely new and improved.  Ana gracefully demonstrates the exercises while the narration is solely performed by Ravi; the set is the same clean, white background used for their other early videos, and I recognized much of the music from their&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dance-the-Chakras-Yoga-Workout-Ana-Brett-Ravi-Singh-With-the-New-MATRIX-Menu-Option/dp/B000I2JCBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dance the Chakras Yoga Workout - Ana Brett & Ravi Singh ***With the New MATRIX Menu Option***</a>&nbsp;as well.

Closing Prayer

Continue reading for my approximate time breakdowns as well as more detailed information on the exercises.

Tune In, 8 minutes
This warm-up segment begins with the traditional ""Ong Namo Guru Dev Namo"" chant.  It also includes breathwork (inhale/exhale through puckered lips to a count of 5) and meditation.

Start Your Engines, 14 minutes
The first two exercises are standing:  ""Ravi Rolls"" performed with Breath of Fire (BOF), followed by side bends.  Next is a seated arms in/out move with the breath, then an arms up/down move with the breath, and finally an elbows back/front move with the breath.  The segment concludes with a brief lying relaxation, offering the option to conclude here or to continue on.

Fight Fire with Fire, 22 minutes
This section has a strong focus on the navel center, with most of the exercises
taking place either on the back or the stomach.  You start lying on the back for alternate hamstring stretches with BOF.  Next, you stretch your legs wide, breathing deeply in this position.  Coming onto the stomach, you perform alternate leg lifts and then bow pose with BOF.  To focus on the abdominals in a seated position, you'll first do single leg raises with BOF and then hold a c-curve position with BOF.  Then it's back to a face-down position for boat (locust) with BOF.  This segment concludes with a lying relaxation that includes a sun meditation, or creating a ""fire in the belly.""

No Impact Aerobics, 12 minutes
This very active segment begins with walking in place (knees up/arms up).  Next comes frog pose, which involves starting in a squat and raising up into a straight-legged forward bend.  Piston pose starts seated on the heels and lifting up and down from this position.  This is followed by a modified push-up (performed on one knee).  Then, it's onto your back for leg raises with BOF and knees in with BOF.  The final exercise is seated, moving alternate arms out to 60-degrees with BOF.  This segment also concludes with a brief relaxation.

Your Life is In Your Own Glands, 14 minutes
For this section, you'll begin holding cow pose with BOF, then holding cat pose with BOF.  Next is a breathing exercise involving breathing in for 16 ""sips""/out 16 sips.  After this you will lie on your back for alternate leg raises, raising your head in-between.  Coming to seated, you'll hold your arms in a s self-hug and then move up and down in a sort of forward bend.  The Deep Relaxation which is listed next on the menu comprises the final few minutes of this segment.

Deep Relaxation
See above.

Breath Meditation with Hands Like a Teapot, 3.5 minutes
For this breath exercise, you will wrap your right hand around your left fist, placing your thumbs next to each other.  You then slowly breathe in through your nose and breathe out through puckered lips, concentrating the breath out on the small space that is formed between your thumbs.  This meditation is supposed to be calming and to help with anxiety.

Meditation for Emotional Healing, 8 minutes
For this meditation, Ravi suggests ""if you can feel, you can heal.""  Therefore, he asks you to imagine feeling particular emotions (sad, afraid, angry) as a means to cope with these emotions.  Between each emotional experience, the chant ""sa-ta-na-ma"" is repeated twice.

Closing Prayer, 2 minutes
As in all of their practices, Ana and Ravi conclude with a prayer for self, for someone who needs a healing prayer, and for peace on earth, ending with sat nam.

I was really surprised by how much I LOVED this DVD!  Although I have dabbled in Kundalini here and there, I mostly do more traditional hatha yoga practices.  However, I have found myself enjoying Ana and Ravi's DVDs more and more, and I think this one might now be tied for my favorite (with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dance-the-Chakras-Yoga-Workout-Ana-Brett-Ravi-Singh-With-the-New-MATRIX-Menu-Option/dp/B000I2JCBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dance the Chakras Yoga Workout - Ana Brett & Ravi Singh ***With the New MATRIX Menu Option***</a>).  Although this workout is about 84 minutes long overall, I loved how it is broken into shorter segments and how each one ends with its own brief relaxation; I tend to squeeze in yoga when I can, so I expect to be using sections of this DVD quite often as ""add-ons.""

Kudos to Ana & Ravi for creating a DVD program which is so approachable and fun, and also so effective. My doctor told me that I had a low thyroid and suggested medication. I had heard that a number of people have had success with various thyroid conditions by using this DVD. Well, it's the age of self-reliance, right? So I went for it. I'm super glad I did. Did you know that once they put you on thyroid medication you're basically on it for life? There's no way I'm going down that road. It's 3 months later and my doctor can't believe my test results.

Remember to keep a neutral neck.  I know Ravi said discomfort was ok as long as it's not painful.  He might be right but why take a chance with your neck?

I wrote to Ravi & Ana and they suggested that I do this DVD at least 3 times a week. They explained that getting rid of belly fat was more than just trying to burn calories. It also involves dealing with stress, emotions, glands, and even proper alignment. Long story short, I started doing this and within 5 weeks I can look in the mirror again without cringing. It worked!!! I'm really thrilled about this. It's magic. Actually, it's science. Whatever it is, it worked! This DVD provides a great workout which you will look forward to doing. It's not so hard that you have to force yourself to do it, but it's not so easy that you long for something more. It's the perfect workout because you look forward to doing it every day.

I am a larger woman, about 270ish... and while some of the stuff was very difficult the rest was fulfilling. The breathing is hard to get use to, and you want to push yourself when you hear her breathing so fast on the dvd. But you have to pace yourself, if you don't you will get sick. I am feeling a little dizzy and weak at the moment, but that is to be expected for my first time. My body is waking up, and so far responding fairly well.

Kundalini is known for keeping the endocrine system (adrenals, thyroid, pineal, and pituitary glands healthy and functioning smoothly.

This is such a great workout done as a whole (there are four 19 minute segments) that I do the whole thing. I like the cardio element, I love the Teapot meditation at the end, and it makes me feel great, gives me energy, confidence, and all the work on my glands keeps me young.

After reading the other reviews on this site, I thought this DVD would be a good workout but found it sorely lacking. It's really a complete yoga practice, with lots of meditation and breathing exercises, and not a workout video at all. So fine if that's what you're looking for, but if you want a vigourous workout this is not the video for you. I didn't find I exerted any energy, nor did I feel loose or strong at the end of it, which I always do after ashtanga yoga and pilates. ""Fat free yoga"" is a misnomer, as there's no way I burned any fat doing it, and though this may seem superficial, the pigtails Ana Brett was wearing (she must be at least 40) were more than a little ridiculous and as such were rather distracting.",1299801600,7,877,4.386503067484663

It relaxes and energizes.......I know that sounds like an oxymoron....but its true. I sleep better, my back has no more aches and pains, my step is quicker, I'm calmer and less stressed...I'm more aware of my posture and my breathing......and the best of all.....I swear I look younger! yep....my menopausal round face is returning to my contoured younger face little by little.

I had done the DVD about 3 times a week for a couple of weeks and saw one of my sisters who I had not seen for a month or two and the first thing she said was.....boy have you lost weight! The sweetest words spoken to any woman, right.....

anyway, get this DVD, open your heart and mind to it and the possibilities it will open to YOU and turn back the hands of time...

p.s. I actually look forward to doing this after work!!  a miracle...LOL...",1297728000,16,1152,4.344186046511628
2396531,5,B000AY6JVK,"If you're looking for a Western-style ""workout"" (fast-paced asanas, techno background music, lost of chatter), don't purchase this DVD; you will be disappointed. For those seeking emphasis on yogic breathing and meditation, however, this is the best I've found. Don't be misled by the ""soft"" approach, though. The poses and exercises in this program are difficult to do correctly, so you will sweat and your heart rate will increase/be maintained. The program includes stand-alone segments of varying lengths, so you can create the session(s)that works best for you. The minimal voice-over is calm and helpful to concentration; the demonstrator is also focused and easy to follow. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone looking for an authentic, sane introduction to breath control, meditation, and the immense benefits these practices bring.",1297382400,8,841,5.476923076923077

You do some total body movements which is very important. The breath of fire is amazing. I purchased this video to help me lower my blood pressure. I am noticing that my breathing is more normal and I am not feeling that sense of anxiety that I sometimes experience. I was pleasantly surprised because I am new to Kundalini yoga.

2396534,5,B000AY6JVK,"Had a fun experience today when my PT told me I don't need to see him anymore and recommended this to me to keep my back healthy at home and especially while traveling - I had to laugh as I informed him - I already got it and have been doing it regularly - It really works the core so it helped get me my back back! I love it! I feel like a 20 something again (could be that it works on those hormones lol!) I didn't get this for the fat burn -so I can't comment there but this is what has got me serious about working out and in shape again (and this is after doing nothing for 20 years!) I appreciate the fact that it is chaptered with 4 sets (from no-impact aerobics to Fight Fire w/Fire and Your Life is in Your Own Glands...), but when I do it I have completed the entire program only because I did not want to stop. You will feel sore in your arms and you will feel a burn in your core but, to me, its what I want to feel with a workout! Best of all, their instruction is quite amazing. I love Ana Brett & Ravi Singh and plan to take a live workshop as soon as they are in the area! I recommend this to everyone including other non-exercisers because - you don't need to have prior experience - as they say - If you can breathe you can do it!",1296604800,3,1248,3.87890625

This was the first time that I truly hurt myself doing yoga - I didn't even think it was possible.  In yoga, if you are feeling pain, you back off and only go to the point of sweet discomfort and your body learns from there.  When I did this dvd, the first time was okay but after that, I found I was in pain.  There are too many repetitive and sharp movements - particularly with the neck and you might not feel that immediately, but you will later.  I do not use this dvd any longer.",1296518400,4,606,3.9344262295081966

Ana & Ravi are definitely tuned in to what people will respond to and have obviously designed their workout based on many years of experience of what works! The music is great. The pacing is perfect! This is one in a million yoga DVD. If you want to lose weight, tone, lessen your stress, or get inspired, I can't recommend this enough!",1291161600,4,630,4.214876033057851

- Before this dvd, I was so stressed out. I couldn't sleep at night. I would eat nonstop because I was so overwhelmed with everything around me, and I gained weight. Also, I was extremely lazy and I felt that nothing was going right.

- When I first received this dvd, I turned it on and my first reaction was ""What in the world is this?"" I thought about not doing the dvd and I was about to throw it away. But one day - it hit me, I thought to myself, ""I think I really need to change."" I did the workouts in this dvd and after 2 1/2 weeks, buying this dvd was the best choice of my life.

- I lost 20 lbs in 2 months. I eat so much better. I'm active. My skin is GLOWING. I can concentrate on my work. I feel so much better physically and mentally. All of my hard work paid off. My body is satisfied with me. I am totally satisfied with myself.

2396539,5,B000AY6JVK,"I lost 10 lbs in 5 weeks with this DVD. It was my first time ever with this form of Yoga, and I had always thought that yoga was a basic sitting-still-sort of thing. Boy, was I wrong! This workout made me feel both energised and relaxed at the same time. The ""breath of fire"" can be mastered in a few days, and then you feel like you've been doing an hour of aerobics, without the sweating and feeling out of breath. The poses seem difficult to get into, until you try them and then you think ""Wow! I can do this??!!!"" I love this DVD. I cant wait to get home and work out to it. Anna is an inspiration, and the music in this DVD is excellent. I wish I could have this as a CD to listen to in the car! If you need to lose weight and you hate jumping around, you should give this a try. Although I lost ten lbs, I look like I lost double that amount because my limbs are so toned and look longer. My neck seems to look slimmer, and I feel 10 years younger too! I know all the exercises by heart now and I am looking forward to working out with this DVD and becoming totally ""fat free"". I also had an underactive thyroid - this is why I tried this ""Yoga for the glands"", and after 3 months,I am bordering on normal. Definitely worth a try!",1286841600,13,1237,3.9718875502008033

I am loving this Fat Freeing workout that consists of 4 workouts. I actually find I enjoy doing evey one of them back to back. Energizing, balancing, and invigorating. Fat Free leaves me feeling as if I'd visited a gym,  acupuncturist and  chiropractor in one session! Excellent stuff!",1285200000,8,416,4.763888888888889

Because you can program it to give you only certain segments, too, I would give it to ANYONE of ANY AGE AND WEIGHT to try. It's the best balance of GENTLE and EFFECTIVE that I've ever encountered -- and I'm a young, fit person who *used to* do aerobics DVDs.

Why work only one part of you when this workout focuses on your 1. Metabolism, 2. Willpower and core strength, 3. Cardiovascular system, and 4. Glands. Throughout your workout you'll hear wise and encouraging words from the accomplished Ravi and Ana, too.

What's great as well, is that I've found something which really works for me - I have learned that weight loss isn't just calories burned - you also need to stimulate your endocrine system so that your body can balance itself! Excess fat just seems to melt off when I dedicate myself to my Kundalini Yoga practice!

You also don't need to do any high-impact cardio to work your large muslce groups. I adore the ""No Impact Aerobics"" segment! I feel I am in better shape now then when I used to run on the treadmill!

I adore the short 20 minute segments too! They're really great when my time is limited and I don't have time to do a full set.

I always finish my Kundalini Yoga session with a huge grin on my face - I feel so amazing - you should definitely give this one a try. No matter what your expertise you will get a great workout!",1284422400,11,935,4.212290502793296

I plugged this DVD in for the 1st time approximately a month ago and now I can't imagine my days without it!  Ana Brett is a wonder to behold, very graceful and so strong.  With Ravi Singh's soothing voice leading you throughout, it's a joy to complete this DVD, either in it's entirety or broken down individually through the excellent Matrix option.
Just in a month, I can feel my flexibility growing, my strength building and an inner peace developing that I didn't even realize I could possess.  Any morning of mine that begins with the ""Start Your Engines"" segment is a guarantee to see me more energized and prepared for what the day will bring.  And when I meditate during the ""Closing Prayer"" segment and hear Ravi Singh say ""Now imagine yourself happy, healthy and fulfilled"", I realize that the image in my mind is a duplicate of my physical self at that exact moment.

2396546,5,B000AY6JVK,"A lot of people swear by this but I remained dubious for a long time, that is until I actually tried it. So, I am here to say that FAT FREE YOGA really works for weight loss. It's because of how it combines work on the glands, emotions, metabolism, in addition to providing a really great workout. It's also broken up into segments so that you can just do 20 min. and feel like you've done something. The problem with most weight loss workouts is the resistance factor, and by that I don't mean as in weight training, but by the fact that a workout won't do you any good if you keep putting off doing it. What I love about Fat Free Yoga is that it keeps drawing me back. I have lost 11 lbs. in two months. Maybe not quite as dramatic as the stuff they advertise on TV, but this was real weight loss, not just water weight or wishful thinking. I'm very grateful for this DVD.",1282780800,5,874,4.147058823529412
2396547,4,B000AY6JVK,I purchased this as a birthday gift for my sister since she just became interested in Yoga. She said it's a great DVD that is easy to follow along with to help get a better understanding of the benefits of Yoga.,1282003200,,211,4.170731707317073

It takes about 80 minutes if you do all sessions, but they pass in a flash. The instructions are well done and clear and although being very experienced in yoga they did not appear too easy and even offered some challenges. Their breathing techniques are amazing. This DVD is really recommendable!",1280620800,,433,4.7105263157894735
2396549,5,B000AY6JVK,"I love my Raviana DVDs and also own Yoga Bliss Hips and Dance the Chakras. I have become a fan of Ana's peaceful beauty and Ravi's calming voice. The minimalist visual is perfect. I enjoy their website and e-newsletter content as well. They strike me as being better educated in authentic Yoga from India than other instructors.

I've read a lot lately about the importance of healing the systems of the body and the glands before weight loss is possible, or long lasting, particularly Fat Flush for Life by a nurse and nutritionist Phd; so this DVD has rung true for me. In my condition it's important that I start slow and my body can't handle high-impact, either. I feel this DVD is a great place to start getting back into shape.

I've also recently become a nose breather through medication--I'd been a mouth-breather all my life due to allergies! Doing Kundalini Yoga, which focuses on the breath, is a revelation to me! I can't have ever been this oxygenated, and hope that this will contribute to revving up my metabolism.

I've done Yoga for years as a means of fighting anxiety, arthritis and body pains. Stretching is great, but I love that these DVDs focus heavily on breathing and meditation--it's given me a sense of inner peace that other forms/classes of Yoga have not. I would recommend Fat Free Yoga to anyone and everyone--in fact, I have sent several people to [...]. I plan on purchasing Navel Power and Transformer soon too.",1279670400,,1446,4.707509881422925
2396550,5,B000AY6JVK,"When I first tried Kundalini Yoga I was very surprised by how different it is, but also by how much I clicked with it almost immediately. It's as if my body and soul had been waiting for this type of yoga. Fat Free Yoga is a genius (if I do say so myself) approach to weight loss. Rather than just have you huff and puff as so many cardio workouts do, and hope for the best, this approach is more multi-dimensional. Of course you work all the major muscle groups, get some cardio in, and some stretching as well, but beyond that there is something about the sequencing and the fact that you're using breathing in a very deep way, which convinces me that it's also working on things like glands and emotions and self-concept. If you're serious about losing weight and keeping it off, and don't want to be like a zombie, doing what everyone else does, with minimal effect, then I highly recommend getting this one. Even if you don't want to lose weight, but just want a great all-around workout for all levels, and to be happy, this is perfect for you.",1279238400,,1050,4.38974358974359

2396552,5,B000AY6JVK,"These are the reasons why I'm really into the Fat Free Yoga DVD: First, I can stick with it all the way through! It's doable, but provides a great workout. The flow of the exercises, the fact that the instructors don't take themselves too seriously, as well as  Ravi & Ana's encouraging instruction, help me to keep up, and getting through a whole workout makes me feel very successful! LOL  I also love the fact that this works on weight loss, not only by burning calories (of all the yoga styles, Kundalini Yoga has the most cardio element), but for other reasons as well  (we blanket ourselves in an extra layer of fat because of old emotions): metabolism, glandular balance and dealing effectively with compulsive habit patters!  I feel lighter, brighter and happier overall after I do this one!",1278979200,4,799,4.726618705035971

I generally practice Kripalu Yoga and some Power Yoga (Baron Baptiste) now and again, too.  This is definitely different, but I really like it.  Ravi's voice is very soothing and if I get a body like Ana's from practicing Kundalini, then I'm quite happy!  All in all, a good video.  Energetic, yet soothing and the breath work is really fun!",1278806400,,428,4.5064935064935066
2396554,5,B000AY6JVK,"This is a another winner from Ravi Singh and Ana Brett.  However, I have a slight problem with all the references to losing weight if you do this DVD.  I don't think you can lose weight by just doing this DVD; you don't burn enough calories.  The meditation exercises after most postures help you to become more mindful of your actions.  This can help those who tend to overeat.

In spite of this, I like this DVD because it makes me feel energized, yet calm.  I don't use it because I think it will help me lose weight.

What I particularly enjoyed about this workout:

**the different music.  I don't think this music is on any of their other DVDs.

**the short meditation exercises after every few postures.  This really helps me calm down and feel centered.

**the short meditations.  I have trouble sitting still and doing any kind of meditation for more than a few minutes.  I've tried and tried and can't, so these short sessions are perfect for me.

**the clean white background, so I could focus on Ana and not be distracted.

I recommend this workout for anyone wanting more exposure to Kundalini yoga.",1278547200,5,1112,4.568527918781726
2396555,5,B000AY6JVK,"This is the First Ana and Ravi DVD that I bought and remains a firm favourite!

Filmed on a pure white background the production is great and accompanying music is lovely.

The Kundalini Class begins with a Tune in via a mantra and then into the warm up section. The Kundalini yoga sets come next and are each followed by a short period of relaxation in savasana (lying down 'corpse' pose) from this point you can either end your class and go to relaxation and or meditation otherwise you can carry on and do the whole class. Next is the relaxation in savasana for a longer duration and then there are two meditations...the choice is yours which one to do or you could do both depending on time and whatever you feel like doing on the day. To end is a Tune out. I feel energised yet tranquil and calm when I have completed the session....for me it is blissful and continues into the day (I do morning practice).

I find Ana inspirational and Ravi is so full of encouragement during the sets. I work within my limitations on any given day, all are slightly different for me so I try to go with the flow.

I had practiced Hatha yoga for approx one year before discovering Kundalini Yoga. My main practice is now Kundalini Yoga.",1278547200,,1225,4.407079646017699

I had planned on one set and did the entire thing and even the meditation! I now have a few dvds and just this morning was thinking about all the benefits I have gotten asides from strength, flexibility and general overall health: I am sleeping better, my skin is glowing, I have lost weight, I eat better, my skin and eyes are glowing,  my thyroid has improved. my digestion has improved, I no longer bloat constantly, my moods are a thousand times better.

2396558,5,B000AY6JVK,"Initially, I found this DVD a little odd. Its not like your typical gym yoga. Its more like pilates/yoga but with a spiritual bent. After I got over my initial shock though, I was thrilled with this new (to me) style of yoga called Kundalini! I felt the effects after my very first workout!

I am a working mom who has suffered from mild depression, back pain, as well as stubborn post pregnancy weight I just could not lose. I have tried everything from extreme cardio workouts to fasting and nothing worked. Now I know it was most likely my glands that needed work of all things LOL!!! I lost10 lbs in less than a month and lost my puffy abdomen as well as my depression. This DVD is literally the best thing I have found to keep me fit, sane, and happy.

There is an opening chant in the beginning and there are 2 meditations at the end. You can skip them if you like and just stick to the yoga. I like the way the 4 yoga each focus on a different aspect of weight loss - glands, metabolism, cardio. The toning element s awesome and its very pilates like with its work on the core and they sneak cardio type moves in too -I love to do the little dance with Ana at the end. How adorable is she!! Even when I program just one of the 4 sets for myself I find myself craving to do the whole workout anyway its so easy and fun!

I actually have become addicted to this DVD and pretty much do the exercises (either all or half) each day. I do skip the chanting meditation parts, though...I just like the workouts and breathing exercises. Some yoga workouts seem too complicated for me at my current level, but I hope to work up to them.

I like this workout sooooo much. It's the perfect balance between what I'm used to in terms of regular fitness and something which also adds stretching and spiritual benefits.

I can get my yoga, cardio, breath work and meditation in a one hour time frame?  Ingenious.

This DVD is one of the best tools I've used to help keep me physically fit, give me calm and peace, and help me to appreciate my life, despite living with chronic illness.

Initially, I found this DVD extremely ""weird,"" for lack of a better term. There is chanting in the beginning, and if you're not used to it, the music may sound a bit odd, too. Initially, I felt a little dizzy doing some of the exercises (the dizziness went away completely after my third time). I was determined to keep at it! Lower back pain? Gone! Burning arms? Gone! Panic attacks? Haven't had one since doing this DVD! I'm 5'2"" and naturally thin (I didn't have to lose any weight per se), but I lost 8 lbs in just 3 weeks. I suffered from mild depression, but after working out to this DVD, I quickly found myself having better days and wanting to do the Happy Dance. The only con (if you can call it that) is I'm used to working out daily, but for only 30 minutes or so. This DVD is pretty long, but you can choose which segments you want to do based on your time constraints. Despite how much time you have, however, you will find yourself wanting to do the whole thing!

This DVD has changed my life! Everyone and their grandma have commented on how slim, healthy, and glowing I look! The best part about this program is it's an exercise program AND a meditation program, so you work out your body as well as your mind/soul. Give it a try - you will not regret it! I felt the effects after just one workout. If you are a working mom who has to deal with stress or a chronic illness (or both!), this DVD is a must-have!!! I have bought copies for my girlfriends and my fellow Lymies. Thank you, Ana and Ravi!",1273190400,13,2392,4.3467561521252795

So, yoga was the obvious place to investigate. This was one of the first Ana Breatt & Ravi Singh DVD's I owned and I started doing it at least 4x per week. The results have been dramatic. I've only lost a few pounds, but my abdominal area is definitely slimmed down, with some new definition.

Despite endless aerobic/spinning classes at my gym I was never able to make even a dent in my belly fat. This DVD helped me get noticable results in three weeks. I wrote to Ravi & Ana and they suggested that I practice this every other day and on the alternate days do their Warrior Workout and Kundalini Yoga Cardio Stretch & Strengthen. They also told me about keeping my blood sugar levels stable (a few brazil nuts between meals reduces sugar cravings). Now my jeans, which had been bursting at the seams, have room to spare! I'm so excited to have found something which works. I'm also very grateful to Ravi & Ana for making this remarkable DVD. It's not too late to get in shape for the beach!

Within a week I felt new energy and most of all some hope. It's now a year later and I feel fantastic. This has inspired me to improve my diet and lifestyle. I realize now that I probably had low thyroid and/or adrenal fatigue. If you have those conditions, or just want something amazing to help you feel more alive, I can't recommend this DVD highly enough.

This DVD has 4 short (16-22 minute sets) which can be done all at once, or you can just do one. If I do another workout ,I will add at least the metabolism boosting set.

2396578,5,B000AY6JVK,"Giving this duo (Ana and Ravi) five stars just doesn't cut it.  I wish I could give them 100 stars, and even that wouldn't feel like enough.  Kundalini Yoga, as practiced through their DVDs, has been a journey of utter amazement for me and my doctor.

About 2.5 years ago, I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism due to Graves' Disease.  Graves' Disease is an autoimmune disorder which wages war on the thyroid gland, wreaking havoc and leaving a myriad of dis-ease in its wake.  Choices for treating this overactive thyroid condition (much more rare than an underactive thyroid) are slim to say the least. In my own research of conventional medicine, I opted for anti-thyroid pills instead of the even-more-awful alternatives.  By my 10th month on the medication, I begged my doctor to let me off to see if my body would remain cooperative.  She agreed because my levels were doing so well, but with a little reluctance.  In a couple of months, my levels started to rise again and she was going to put me back on the anti-thyroid meds.  I begged her to give me ONE MORE MONTH!  That I had an idea that I thought might work and I'd only just learned about it.  That I had such high hopes that it was right and would bring my system back into balance.  Very reluctantly, she agreed.  My idea was Kundalini Yoga.  And, boy, was I right on!!

I started practicing every day, sometimes twice per day, with Ana and Ravi via their incredible DVDs, and returned for a blood test in exactly one month.  When my doctor came into the office, she sat down in front of me and took off her glasses, and sat there looking at me in silence.  I said, ""What?"" unable to hide the smile on my face.  She said she couldn't believe it, but my levels dropped back down to the normal range; not only that, they were PERFECTLY BALANCED.  Something she did not expect, not by a long shot!  She asked what I was doing differently.  I told her Kundalini Yoga along with some natural alternatives to harsh medication, like acetyl-L-carnitine and flaxseed oil and a multivitamin containing NO iodine but 200mcg of selenium.  She smiled and released me for a record three months.  I continued my strenuous practice, and three months later, PERFECT BALANCE.  One year later: perfect still.  2.5 years later..... I think you get the point. Not only that, but my eyes are perfect, my weight is perfect, and my skin is glowing.  I no longer have heart palpitations or insomnia or anything other nasty symptom of Graves'.

Now that I've written an essay, I'll summarize by saying:  For me, Kundalini Yoga has helped me perform a miracle.  Graves' is no joke, and it is important to include your doctor in this plan, but I'll tell you, it worked.  And I feel great after every practice... I can't get enough!  I own every one of their DVDs and do them in rotation.  I believe it has healed me in so many ways, and I am eternally grateful for that.  Not to mention, I have a kick-ass physique.  Thanks for the smokin' body, too.  :-)",1266969600,36,2993,4.530841121495327

I've been doing yoga and pilates for years and I would never have described yoga as exciting. However, Kundalini yoga is and especially with these two. It's 16 times more powerful than any other yoga. The high will put a grin on your face.

There are also two meditations to pick from. One is to relax, soothe, and destress you. The other is to process out old emotions and get clear with yourself. My opinion is that there's so much generic yoga stuff out there, most of which is afraid to go beneath the surface. Ana & Ravi are the real deal, on every level.",1265587200,6,646,4.391666666666667

The girl in video even spends a few minutes panting like a dog. I wish I could say I was joking but I am not. I gave this to 2 different friends who also felt it was very strange. I read the positive reviews on this and good rating and it was my 1st experience with any yoga. After watching this I assumed yoga was not my thing and didn't try it again for 2+ more years. Boy was I wrong, this DVD almost ruined yoga for me forever. I tried a regular mainstream yoga class recently and I LOVE it! I can't stress enough to do some extra research on this before wasting your money and hating yoga like I did.

2396584,5,B000AY6JVK,"I love this DVD. I was a bit skeptical at first- some of the breathing techniques are a litle wierd and for some reason I have to follow a stick-thin chick in pigtails sitting on a flower rug, but don't let any of that put you off.

I bought this DVD in October of 2008, and I've done it at least weekly, sometimes more, since then. I was borderline overweight at the time and I was looking for creative ways to work out more. By New Year's 2009 I was 20 lbs lighter and healthier than I had been since high school. I was in college then, and I had learned of just about any excuse to blow off being healthy- late night pizza runs, drinking, being too busy to work out, all-you-can-eat dining halls, no parents to cook for me, etc. I also started running 3x a week when I bought the DVD, but I don't think I would have kept up with it or have had the same success without Fat Free Yoga.

First of all, the breathing exercises and the gland-toning exercises really do work, I'm convinced. You feel silly while doing them, but afterwards you are SO refreshed and rejuvenated!

Second, this is a good balance to other workout routines. It's not as intense as running, but it still gets your heart rate up and it forces you to really do some good stretching. I would do it on my off days.

Third, it is good for your SOUL. I am not joking- Ravi's voice is very soothing and he encourages you to work on your mind as well as your body. Even if you don't buy into everything he says, it's still remarkably calming to do all the breathing and stretching this DVD involves.

I usually start with ""Start your engines,"" which has a lot of breathing and glandular stuff, then move onto ""Fight fire with fire,"" which involves some classic yoga poses like boat and bow and some low-impace crunshes and leg work. Finally, I do the dog/cat poses with breath of fire at the beginning of ""your life is in your own glands,"" and then meditate.

The matrix option is simply amazing because you can do whatever workout you're in the mood for!",1263772800,13,2021,4.3052631578947365

I was quite surprised by the physical reaction I had to this program, actually. It doesn't feel like a workout either (other than that you are breathing hard in a hysteria sort of way) although Ana doesn't seem to have any fat on her at all. So she must be doing something.

There are literally hundreds of reviews of this disc already so I'll just mention the main points:

1.  Ana & Ravi approach this practice with a positive spirit that leaps off the DVD and makes you simply feel good.  They're upbeat.  You can't help but feel good by the time you finish the practice.

2.  The exercises are pretty effective. After only 2 times using the DVD I got relief for my sciatica.

3.  The workouts are interchangeable which keeps things interesting.  The matrix option is a great invention.

I look forward to doing this DVD again.  If you're thinking of buying it make sure you understand what kundalini yoga is.  This disc is worthwhile and effective but will be a surprise if you're new to kundalini yoga.  Yes, kundalini yoga has dubious origins (see my other review for brief summary of that topic), but these exercises are still enjoyable.  It's feel-good stuff.",1258070400,7,1141,4.6767676767676765

Fat Free Yoga is an active yoga workout which is fitness but it goes deeper than fitness because it works on things like hormonal balance, bodily systems, and improving your mental outlook and making your emotions more positive.

It is not 'athletic' in the traditional sense and quite a bit of the exercises are based on breath. I found this to be a challenge as using the 'breath of fire' (quick sniffs in and out of the nose) was something I was completely unfamiliar with. I have been doing the 'fighting fire with fire', 'no impact aerobics' and 'your life is in your glands' sections. These sections made my heart rate increase and warmed me up. The meditations on the DVD are something that I may do before I go to bed, or to relax after a long day. I'm sure that meditation and relaxation can help with weight loss, but I have yet to see results from it. This is a good DVD to do if you are interested in trying something different than what is considered traditional weight loss yoga.",1253923200,8,866,4.286585365853658

I even tried other weightloss yoga workouts but they mostly just add weights and don't do much else and I can do that at the gym! This type of yoga has an aerobic aspect and it works on a very deep level like your glands and emotions. I suddenly have less appetite and am now losing weight in the most natural way which makes me feel very healthy and very very happy! The workouts are moderately challenging but completely doable which means any level can do any exercise and will feel the benefits!

I absolutely love this workout and this style of yoga which is so dynamic. I can literally feel the energy moving through me. It is the closest thing I have found to the style of yoga I teach: Kripalu Yoga. I have done research on Kundalini Yoga and have discovered that it is the original form of yoga and also the highest form of yoga. In ancient times a student had to progress through all the other types and styles of yoga before they were taught Kundalini, but Ana & Ravi have made it so accessible that everyone can do it at every level. I can't wait to start my classes again so I can teach these sets (on Fat Free Yoga) to my students. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for something new, exciting, and very effective in the yoga world. Thanks Ana & Ravi for the great work and inspiration!",1250121600,5,1043,4.299492385786802

I was not feeling good about myself before I got this and now that I'm seeing results I'm on top of the world. I guess one likes to feel that one has some control over things. Regular exercise just didn't cut it for me. Fat Free Yoga delves beneath the surface to work on the important stuff for weight loss: hormonal balance, energy flow, and self-image. It also happens to be a great workout. You will recognize this as yoga but a more dynamic type of yoga. It's still very doable. There wasn't one exercise I couldn't do. Every exercise has a breathing pattern associated with it. That makes it very aerobic. The two meditations at the end are very moving. I've lost 7 lbs. in a month and when I look in the mirror I see things I never saw before. I know this sounds like some sort of infomercial, but it all happens to be true!

2396612,1,B000AY6JVK,"""Fat free yoga"" is a workout DVD that is loosely inspired by yoga, much as Pilates is loosely inspired by yoga.  Visually, the workout is performed by a lady on a white background, using a small round pink rug for her ""yoga"" mat.  The voiceover is done by a man.  The workout emphasizes calisthenics and seated aerobics. There are long segments where you sit and chant ""ohm"" (4 minutes), sit and breath in different ways (4 minutes), lay prone and relax (3 minutes), and so on, so that the ""90 minute workout"" claim is much exagerated.  There are also frequent corpse pose rest breaks between exercises, so this probably will not keep your pulse in your target heart range throughout.

The majority of the exercise movements do not in the least resembles Yoga -- like march in place, or sit while flapping your arms like a bird. Some movements are yoga inspired, but changed -- like taking what would usually be an isometrical hold for 30 seconds, and instead moving in & out of the position for a minute. Yoga's ""breath of fire"" is used occasionally to further work the abdominals. This was interesting and unique, but the possibility of unpleasant side effects is mentioned in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anatomy-of-Hatha-Yoga-A-Manual-for-Students-Teachers-and-Practitioners/dp/0970700601/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anatomy of Hatha Yoga: A Manual for Students, Teachers, and Practitioners</a>. The yoga moves do not build upon one another (e.g., toward looser hips), but rather are separated in time and randomly mixed with non-Yoga moves.

I found the DVD voice over to be very annoying.  There is an occasional bit of instruction, and a whole lot of new age mumbo jumbo like ""your kidneys will love you for this"" or ""if you've ever failed at self improvement, don't loose hope."" I've not quoted him exactly, this is the gist of it.

The emphasis of ""fat free yoga"" is strengh (NOT flexibility), and it has the feel of calisthenics. Calisthenics are less efficient at building strength than weightlifting, but this DVD's approach would slowly make you stronger. ""Fat free yoga"" felt like a moderately aerobic workout that would need 60 minutes minimum to give me an effective workout (e.g., unlike step aerobics can be fast and intense). I never had the feeling that I was building flexibility.

The ""matrix"" idea has merit, but will only be valuable if you adore this DVD's content.  The DVD is divided into around 12 chapters, between 3 and 21 minutes long.  The ""matrix"" option allows you to choose the chapters you want to do, and the order in which these chapters should appear.

Nonetheless, the claim of ""four 20-minute workouts"" is an exageration.  This DVD is intended to be ONE 90-minute workout, and while it can be separated into shorter workouts using the ""matrix"", these did not flow well and felt incomplete to me. I don't have 90 minutes free most days for exercise, and I don't think that this sort of workout could be as benneficial if cut short.

Personally, I think of exercise as (1) necessary and (2) boring. I've tried a huge variety of exercise routines -- swimming, weight lifting, step aerobics, rowing, belly dance, pilates, exercise bike, etc. Yoga is not the most effective, but I feel better afterward, and I can't say that about any of the others. I was really excited to try this highly rated Yoga DVD, and felt betrayed that the name on the box (""Yoga"") in no way matched the contents. Expectations aside, this workout was nothing special, as forgetable as 30 minutes on an exercise bike or doing laps in a pool.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend you purchase this DVD.  If you want a combined strength building and aerobic workout, you'll be much better off buying one of ""The Firm"" workouts like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Firm-Total-Body-Toner/dp/B000TJ6P60/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Firm - Total Body Toner</a>.

2396617,5,B000AY6JVK,"In June'08 when I went for my annual medical checkup and a routine blood work - the blood reports indicated that I had Hypothyroidism.

My doctor gave me a prescription of Synthoid (thyroid hormone replacement) which I had to take 1 tabled a day in the morning for a lifetime.  I was devastated.

I did not want to start any medications that I had to take for a lifetime.  and hence thought of exploring some alternatives for another 6 months to an year and then start the synthyroid only if the natural alternatives fail.

After endless Googling day and night, I came up with these reasonable alternatives which I could try over the next one year:
 (1) Fat free yoga - this DVD - thanks to another reviewer (Amber) who suggested that this could cure Hypothyroidism
 (2) Increasing Selenium intake  - Brazil nuts are a rich natural source of Selenium

This is exactly how I implemented my own research:
=================================================
 (1) Fat free yoga
-> Full 90 minutes of workout (all the workout routines in this DVD)
-> Once a week (yes ! only once a week) since I had a busy lifestyle and dedicating 90 minutes a day would have been difficult

 (2) Fat free yoga
-> First 25 minutes of the workout ('Breath Primer', 'tune in', 'Start your engines')
-> Twice a week

 (3) Brazil nuts
-> Consuming about 3 to 4 slightly roasted brazil nuts day as a part of my breakfast cereal
-> 4 times a week

:::: It does not matter which time of the day you do the yoga workout.  But mornings are the best. I used to do this yoga either between 7 to 8 in the morning or 6 to 7 in the evenings.

Results - 1st round
===================
To track progression, I took a Thyroid test 6 months later and found that my Thyroid activity had improved.  TSH levels had improved from 5.3 to 4.2.  Borderline, but not ideal

I continued to follow the exercise routine in the same frequency

Results - 2nd round
===================
I went for my next annual medical checkup and blood work in July'09.  The doctor gave me an strange look when I mentioned that I am not taking Synthyroid, he ordered a comprehensive thyroid test (Thyroid panel test) which will not only test TSH (Thyroid stimulating hormone), but also T3 and T4 which are the actual Thyroid hormones.

When the results came out, not only was I floored, but the doctor was in total disbelief :)
My TSH stood at 2.7, compared to 5.3 an year back.  My T3 and T4 thyroid hormones looked in a perfectly normal range !

Other benefits
===============
Like the other reviewers have mentioned that the DVD is very well done, good voice over, Excellent music that goes well with the exercises.  The innovative MATRIX system which was very helpful to pick and choose the exercises.

It helped me improve my energy levels, my cardio-vascular functioning, lose weight ...

More about Thyroid numbers
===========================
What is T3 and T4 ?
These are your main thyroid hormones.  T4 is Thyroxine and T3 is triiodothyronine.  A 'normal' thyroid test does not test for T3 and T4, ask your doctor/lab to test for T3/T4 in addition to TSH for a comprehensive test

What is TSH ?
Your body secretes a hormone known as TSH - Thyroid Stimulating Hormone, it is like an email sent from your body to the thyroid to secrete more thyroid hormones (T3 & T4).  If the TSH is more, it means that your thyroid is not doing its job and your body is sending more emails (TSH) requesting the thyroid to secrete more of T3/T4.

A few precautions
=================
-->Some of the exercise involves a lot of neck movement for thyroid.  You want to be careful and take it slow and easy else you might hurt your neck.  Do not overdo, anything for that matter.  Infact, in one of the exercise, the narrator - Ravi Singh mentions that it is ok if your neck feels uncomfortable, but not painful : Very important point.

-->Finally the disclaimer !! I am not a medical doctor hence this is not medical advice.  My only intention is to share my research and help others, just like other reviewers have shared their knowledge which has helped me !",1247529600,59,4076,4.586445366528354

My belly fat is rapidly decreasing, my posture is more aligned and I'm getting more flexible everyday! I used to have backaches when I walked for over 20 minutes, due to bad posture. But, now I can walk and stand for a long period of time, without any backache at all. Also, I suffer from thyroid problems and I have noticed a change for the better on that front as well.  When I noticed these changes in my body, I knew it was because of this workout.  My clothes are getting more loose and I know if I keep it up, I will soon reach my ideal weight and tone up completely.  Ana demonstrates the poses very well and Ravi has the most relaxing and soothing voice ever.  I look forward to doing this workout, along with my other Ana and Ravi workouts every single day.  They never fail to keep me motivated and inspired.  I wish all yoga DVDs were this amazing.  If you are on the fence about purchasing this DVD, don't be!  You will love it!

The thought of yoga never interested me because I thought it would be too slow and cerebral but it turns out that this type of yoga is active with some really cool elements. The breathing while exercising is a whole new world. I also like the different segments so I don't have to battle with myself about doing the whole thing. I can just do 20 min. and feel like I had a workout.

Ana & Ravi have broken the mold and taken some risks and it's paid off in spades, as they say! Their work is really original and authentic and soulful.

2396626,5,B000AY6JVK,"I am in my early 20s and blessed with a fairly slim figure, I would say I was a US 2-4. Having said that, with starvation not being an option, I always found it impossible to lose the last 5 or 6 pounds to achieve the elusive size 0 body. Although I am fairly active, I don't exactly love gyms hence despite being a size 2-4, I had unsightly bits of lumps and bumps.

With fat free yoga however, I have achieved my target.

Not only was it less difficult than gym workouts, I felt really relaxed and at peace with my self. So a super efficient workout. Personally I think it is easier to lose the first few pounds than the last with any workout.
So whether you are looking to shed a lot or the final bit, this is the workout for you. Guaranteed. I think anyone can be very slim like models on tv, without being anorexic. We just need the right tools, and of course the will to stay away from harmful greasy junk food. Thats not enjoying food, thats Gluttony.

So aim higher, anyone can be a size 0. If you are a bigger girl, opt for a dairy free smoothie for breakfast or dinner and do this workout. You will get the vital vitamins, enzymes and a lot less calories and toxins.
Do this dvd. I spent ages looking for a dvd that actually worked. So I hope this review saved your time.

Finally persevere, after the first workout, breath of fire was too much for me and as I wasn't super fit, I gave up for two months. The dvd was gathering dust and I tried it again. This time, I tried to do too much and felt disheartened as I was nowhere near as Ana. Hence gave up again. 2 Months I tried it again. Only this time, I thought I will try to do whatever I can. I may not be the most flexible and I may not get the poses right. But heck, I thought marginal returns. Hence the weight loss and the new body.

I walk away feeling like I got a great workout in and, like the cherry on the spoon, I feel relaxed, limber and incredible. I do this DVD 1-2 times a week as it gives me a boost in my yoga workouts, making me feel stronger in all of the poses.

I am a diehard Ravi & Ana supporter. I feel confident that any DVD they put out there is beyond excellent. I will buy every DVD they create and hope to attend some of their classes sometime in my life. Highly recommended for any levels from beginners to advanced, you will be hooked!",1241136000,6,812,4.205128205128205
2396635,5,B000AY6JVK,"This is not your everyday yoga- If you're looking to do classic vinyasa flow yoga, this DVD is not for you. However, I do highly recommend this DVD. I like it for the following reasons:

-I can switch up my workout each time with the matrix, make it longer or shorter- whatever! The sections vary in length, but are just right.

-It's the perfect mix of challenging and yet not too strenuous (it gets easier over time, too!)There's a nice mix of cardio and toning stuff.

-I got results. I started eating better, running 3x a week, and doing this DVD and I felt better and lost about 25 lbs. I wasn't overweight, either- just on the high side of normal. Now I'm quite trim and fit and I have so much more energy!

Some of the techniques seem a little goofy at first, but just give it a try... you won't regret it!",1240963200,7,813,4.259740259740259
2396636,5,B000AY6JVK,"This DVD is simply magic. I have seen a real difference in my body in just 3 weeks and best of all - I love doing the exercises! The only workout I've ever enjoyed and I have no real yoga experience.  My jeans fit better (a great feeling!) and my legs and arms are noticeably toner.  My appetite, previously OUT OF CONTROL, is completely in check, which I credit to the ""gland"" workout and the meditation. I am not overweight but I have always had a problem controlling my appetite - until now. I feel radiant.  I would like to make more time for the DVD - I want to do it EVERY DAY and am going to make it a priority to do so because I feel so good when I'm done - and the feeling stays with me.  Will post another review in a few weeks - please check back.  Thank you Ana and Ravi!",1240531200,9,783,3.961783439490446
2396637,1,B000AY6JVK,"I am so bummed I thought I would write a review of this dvd- something I would not take the time to do unless I really hate it, and I do. It has hardly any stretching and is not at all challenging. If you're a dude and like to stare at a really fit lady doing stupid-looking moves (like sitting and flapping her elbows ""like a bird"" while breathing like she's doing something difficult like running) you might find this mildly entertaining. If you're seriously looking for a yoga workout, this is not the dvd to buy.",1240185600,11,516,4.329896907216495

2396639,5,B000AY6JVK,"This is one of the things in my life that, once I discovered it, makes me wonder how I ever lived without it! Like another reviewer mentioned, sometimes cardio and diet is not enough. This DVD worked like a charm to get me off a long, long plateau and back to slimming down. I am now a size 4 and proud of my new muscle tone! I have never been happier with my body and I am 44! My weight is where I want it to be so now I am using a set a day to maintain. I love the Matrix which lets me program just the parts I need. I make sure I do the metabolism set at least 4 times a week because that is what I feel was the missing ingredient for me!
I love the bright set, the happy music, the encouraging instruction, the exercises are fun, and the yoga works!",1238803200,9,753,3.8333333333333335

I love the explanations for each workout and what part of your body (both inside and out) that you are working on.  I have completed the first 2 workout sessions and am ready to move onto the next.  Oh...it helps me sleep..I do it mostly at night when the kids are in bed and it helps me relax.,1238371200,3,446,4.0227272727272725

I didn't feel like I was getting a full workout as the poses were to abrupt and the lady on the daisy mat and the narrator would stop after every pose to do breathing exercises. I attempted to go through the whole dvd once and my attention span was gone after the third pose. The other reviewers are right about the lady being creepy and the narrator being creepy.

I would not recommend this dvd!",1237680000,8,438,4.214285714285714

I am a little bored with my regular yoga routine (more traditional slow movement) and this spiced things up!  I actually liked the chanting and the explanation of the potential benefits to your organs and glands.  I work best when I understand the reason for the activity.  I feel like a million bucks!,1237334400,6,395,4.430555555555555
2396643,1,B000AY6JVK,"I don't get all of the positive feedback. I found this DVD to be strange and not a good workout at all. Ana lays on what looks like a bathmat with her eyes closed and lips pursed doing odd poses and speed breathing. Obviously a lot of people love this workout, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.[...]",1236902400,8,299,4.084745762711864

Or do the whole thing. This is very different from the Hatha Yoga I had done in the past. I like both and I like a balance of the two.,1236643200,3,294,3.9166666666666665
2396645,3,B000AY6JVK,"I read all the reviews for this and bought it.. Seriously.. your favorite Yoga video?
I usually do Rodney Yee videos, Power Yoga is my favorite. Maybe that is why I didn't like this. I am 28, have been doing yoga on and off for about 8 years, and I think I am in pretty good shape. I didn't get this to lose weight but the title made me think it was going to be a good workout. All you Yogis are going to hate me for this review because I don't like to chant when I do yoga.. sorry. Maybe when I am older and have more time to sit still and contemplate enlightenment. I have a four year old, not much me time..
The best part: The fire breath. Lots of breathing, which is fine and I think the more challenging aspect of this DVD. I have heard the 'Fire Breath"" is amazing for inner core strengthening, so I gave it a whirl. Not only was I bored, I was really annoyed at Bret talking in the background about how ""[your] kidneys (pituitary, liver, heart) are going to love you for this"" over and over. I liked the fact they were doing exercises that were stimulating my pituitary gland and organs  but I didn't want him talking about it endlessly, once would suffice. I should have put it on mute. Although, I did respond to the pituitary exercise, it did rev up my libido.. thats all I am saying about that. SO three stars for a good night.
Another thing, Ana was on little hot pink fuzzy round circle rug that was the center of a painted daisy.. ?? Cute..
The breathing and arm exercises were the only challenging thing in this video. Fire breath and rapid 45* arm raises, in and out..
I would NOT say you could lose weight with this video, however. The reviewer that said she lost too much weight doesn't eat or something.
For a very beginner video is was probably good, it was ""fun"", but boring and annoying. Maybe it is good as a supplement to your normal yoga routine if you are active, but definitely not a stand alone if you are truly looking to lose weight.
I'll stick to Rodney Yee.",1236556800,8,1989,4.2204724409448815
2396646,5,B000AY6JVK,"I bought this video along with a slower video.  They compliment eachother perfectly.  The slower one is more geared to stregnth and edurance where this one is geared more toward a cardio syle yoga.

This video took a little getting used to.  I am a huge fan of the deep breathing slow paced yoga, but this is niether.  In this program there is a lot of fast and sharp sharp breathing and actions.  For the first few tries I thought I was going to hyperventilate, but the more I do it the better I get.

I did find that the first exercise segment is PERFECT for re-setting my back when it is out.  The other segments are great, but as I said are geared to the cardio aspect.  This doesn't have the calming and nurturing aspect of what traditional yoga teaches, but is a fun video.  All 4 of my kids love to do this video with me.

I have not lost much weight.  After having a neccessary hysterectomy I know I may never actually loose weight, so will settle for inches instead.

I believe this video is great for people of all levels looking for a good work out.  Just don't expect the typical yoga.",1235692800,3,1097,4.262135922330097
2396647,5,B000AY6JVK,"I just got this DVD but already I can tell you that this DVD might be the best yoga exercise DVD around. Why?

1. The workouts are varied, and different. Excellent blend of Stomach, Leg, Arm exercises....you definitely feel ""worked out"" when you're done.

2. Ravi Singh has such a calming voice. His oratory is descriptive enough that you can figure out how to do most of the poses by his description alone. This is great since Yoga definitely has a meditative component to it which for me only works when my eyes are closed. Nonetheless when your eyes open to get some additional guidance on how to do the pose, Ana does not disappoint either. Not only is she quite the yogi, but equally a hottie! A visual treat!

3. The matrix feature on this DVD is AWESOME! And I am quite shocked that all exercise DVDs don't include this as standard. Let me elaborate for those who have no idea what I am talking about. Basically it is a section on the disc which lets you select individual chapters on the disc to create a custom program. Very very convenient since you don't have to get up everytime to find the remote to fast forward through sections you don't want to do on any given day.

4. I got this disc for $10...a bargain when you consider the content, and overall quality of the disc.

5. Do I have to say anything else...if you read this far hopefully I have convinced you to make the investment in this disc. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.",1235433600,6,1448,4.408239700374532

2396650,5,B000AY6JVK,"This DVD is both relaxing and challenging. The great thing about yoga is that there is always room for improvement. Better balance, better flexibility, better toning, more energy, etc etc. I'm definitely interested in more DVDs by this duo.

My only complaint, and this is very minor in comparison to the pros, is that the workout is a little too long (over an hour) if you want to complete the entire workout. Granted, you have the option to customize your workout, but I try to do every chapter if I have enough time (except for the meditations at the end, I just do one). But you can still do a decent amount for just under an hour.",1235347200,5,635,4.427350427350428

I've used it now for 5 days a week twice a day for over a month and I like the way it makes me feel.  My whole day is good after a yoga session.  I also like that you can customize your workout to suit yourself.  Either a long one or a short one and the price was just right.  The meditations along with the exercises are just wonderful and make you feel everything is right with the world.,1235260800,2,496,3.92

Pilates, Feldenkrais, Alexander, martial arts and yoga.  I am not one to give enthusiastic reviews
but Ana and Ravi are really outstanding and deserve all the praise they get.  Excellent instruction,
wonderful production with great music, and well-paced exercises that make you feel energized,
peaceful and centered all at once.  I felt the difference in my mood almost from the first breathing
exercise.  By the time I finished the dvd I was blissful.  Plus, and it is a great PLUS, I've lost my
appetite and droppedalmost 3lbs the first week of doing the workout.  I have recommended this video

2396653,5,B000AY6JVK,"Great for Everyone

I've tried all the different yoga styles, but Kundalini Yoga with Ana & Ravi is the one I'll be sticking to: for the following reasons:

1. I immediately feel the benefits 5 min. into the workout I'm already feeling happier and more energized.

2. As other people have mentioned the workouts are fun. You're never bored for a minute. You pretty much get right into the workout. No long rambling intros or commercials.

3. As others have also stated, this type of yoga really does work for weight loss, because of its work on the glands and mood balancing, so I feel I'm multi-tasking when I do this.

4. Every single one of their workouts engages every muscle. It's always a nice even workout.

5 . The instruction is 1st rate. It makes such a difference to study with experienced yogis like this. You know you're in great hands.

I own a few of their DVD's already, which I rotate. I plan to get more. I recommend this and their excellent Kundalini Yoga for Beginners & Beyond to start.",1234742400,7,1007,4.5

I FELT it immediately in my arms, shoulders and abs. The ""love handle eradicator"" move is fantastic! I will update again after more use but felt compelled to jump right in with a first impression! In addition, after doing the DVD, I googled kundalini yoga and found that Ana and Ravi are on tour and coming to Connecticut for a workshop next month!

2396657,5,B000AY6JVK,"After only four times following the DVD two times a week, I have relief from chronic lower back pain. Over a year ago, I injured my lower back with the result being torn muscles and ligaments.  Physical therapy helped initially but did not rid me of the constant pain.  The exercises I did at physical therapy sometimes made me feel worse.  Someone had mentioned to me about doing yoga so I looked it up on amazon.com and found Ravi & Ana's ""Fat Free Yoga"" with many positive reviews.  I believe with time, if I do not recover fully, it will be pretty darn close to full recovery!  I have yet to lose weight after doing the DVD about six times but do notice my spine/body starting to realign and I ""look"" slimmer and my clothes are fitting better.  Ravi and Ana have my eternal gratitude!",1234137600,8,788,4.4

I bought the video because of all the fantastic reviews, but the instructor is just a tad too odd for me and it is weird that while she is doing the exercises a loud deep mans voice is narrating. It was a bit odd for me and I guess I will just stick with the 10 minute solution videos.",1233532800,7,378,3.7974683544303796
2396662,5,B000AY6JVK,"I decided to write this review after an email response from Ana and Ravi.  They were very accessible and gave useful and loving advice.  I have had this DVD for about 6 months, and am currently rotating this DVD with 3 others by Ana Brett and Ravi Singh (Yoga Beauty Body, Yoga Quick Fixes and Dr. Yoga House Call. I am also anxiously awaiting one of their new DVDs!).  I love all these DVD's but if I have 90 minutes for yoga, this is the one I will always choose.  I am still fairly new to yoga, but I am able to do the exercises on all of these DVD's.  Having said that, I do not think the level is too easy either.  This style of yoga seems unique in that the exercises appear simple on the surface, but almost magically give you results that you may not even expect.  The most noticeable effect for me was my drastic improvement in the way I have been able to deal with stress.  I am currently working as a research scientist, and work can get stressful and chaotic.  I used to get stressed and negative at work almost everyday.  Now I am able to truly focus on what I want to accomplish and what I need to do to be happy.  After doing this yoga I have found myself able to avoid many situations that involve negative conversations, including gossip.  I have also become much more focused on finding my true purpose.  I strongly believe that regular practice with Kundalini yoga can help you focus your mind in such a way that you will be able to make your dreams concrete.  I have become so inspired and intrigued by Kundalini yoga, that I am hoping to incorporate this into my research on cognitive function!

I highly recommend this DVD, as well as any of the other DVDs mentioned in this review.  I also recommend visiting their website ([...])to join their mailing list and also look at their workshop schedule.  I have attended two of their workshops, and they are even better in person!

2396663,5,B000AY6JVK,"This video was recommended by Amazon and already had high ratings so that's why I decided to try it. I agree with others: it's enjoyable, easy to follow (yet strenuous, of course), fun and I'll add ""different"" because it's not like the yoga I was practicing before. (Being a novice, I didn't know there were so many different kinds.) I like this DVD because it has sections to choose from and the continuity and narrative instruction are good throughout. You can either choose to quit after each session or go on. My only warning would be to pace yourself. Ana does the exercises very quickly but you might have to work up to her speed. Also, don't overdo and try to bend as much as she does. I've irritated my sciatic nerve in my low back and now I'm going to have to take some more Feldenkrais therapy classes which really helped me when I was taking yoga classes before. If you can find Feldenkrais in your area I highly recommend it as a complement to yoga. It's amazing.",1233446400,2,975,4.4525139664804465

The set really tones you and keeps you fit, if you keep up with it. What I love the most is that you can do just a 20 minute bit or the whole thing (which I usually end up doing, even if I start out thinking I won't) and still feel great (the title does not lie). Plus, you can be new to yoga and still do this with all the benefits.

I've actually bought this DVD to many of my friends and they've caught the Kundalini bug, too! Thank you Ana and Ravi for such a good programme.",1233273600,3,636,3.9609375

People say it's fun and great and it makes you feel good. That's true, but it's also makes my mucsles ache and it's really not the fun. The best way i've found is to think of something great and get it over with. But afterword you feel really great.

Word of caution to all woman with big breasts, there are some exersizes were this will cause some dificulty. Like when you are supposed to raise your feet six inches lift your head and do the breath of fire I've found this very difficult to do all the way through becasue of my breasts. I have DD and gravity casues them go towards my face and it is very hard to do the breath of fire when you can not breath.

When it comes to the arm exersizes, do not stop becasue once you stop it becomes that much harder. Never clench your teeth while breathing because, for some reason, it makes breathing more dificult. Keep your jaw slightly slack.

Also if you experiance neck pain after Start Your Engines and the segment after, straiten your spine more, that will ease the discomfort.

Overall this DVD is excellent. I highly recomend it. It last about one hour and twenty minutes all the way through.",1233187200,4,1333,4.358870967741935

You're not just doing a workout, you're engaging all your senses: the soothing voices giving flawless instruction, the great music, and the best thing is that the benefits come so fast and so cumulative. I've tried so many things, but I now realize that weight loss is all about the glands, and no other form of yoga addresses this more directly than Ana & Ravi's Kundalini Yoga style. Fat Free Yoga strikes the perfect note of not too hard and not too easy. Beginners will appreciate this and as you progress through your yoga, like me, you will never want to stop using this one.",1232928000,3,695,4.568

If you just want a good workout with a meditative undertone, it's great!  It is a well-balanced video and I really enjoy being able to create my own workout via the Matrix for what I am able to do that day.  By the way, I did find the Breath of Fire to be a bit unnerving at first but if you find your own rhythm, it works beautifully.

They are intense and contemplative at the same time.  They combine everything you need to be healthy - good cardio, increased flexibility, bone and muscle strengthening.  I would recommend them to ANYONE - regardless of fitness level or age because you can always modify and go at your own pace.

I'm convinced that doing this dvd and the others re-booted my metabolism because since I started doing yoga--this one in particular--I reached my goal weight and even lost 10 more pounds without really trying.  Yoga is not the only lifestyle adjustment that I have made, but Ana & Ravi have been instrumental in helping me create my now healthier body and life.  I highly recommend this dvd for weight loss in particular, but any one of their other dvd's for anyone interested in feeling more healthy, peaceful, beautiful, and powerful.",1232409600,6,689,4.813559322033898
2396672,5,B000AY6JVK,"Fat Free Yoga  is an excellent all around fitness workout. It does everything claimed. It is great for shedding excess bodyweight and I find it even helps with cardio training - (which is great for me because I did intense cardio for 10 years - don't feel it did anything for me and I want to leave it far behind!!).

I am finally becoming happy with my body. My fitness levels, health, energy, and sense of wellness keep increasing, and I find it tons of fun!!!!! I think it is a super method of total body/spirit training. Kundalini Yoga is more fun to me than any other style of yoga because it is active and can provide a total body toning, energizing and cardio workout within 15-30 minutes.",1232409600,4,696,4.4296875
2396673,5,B000AY6JVK,"I've accumulated a number of fitness dvd's, including yoga and pilates.  As respects yoga and pilates in particular, the two most annoying things I have encountered is a) the producer's idea of what is ""beginner level"" and b) the need to go crazy with the new age, zen, blissed out, gently rolling waves and tropical locales.  Folks wrapping themselves into pretzel shapes and easily/quickly moving through moves/poses that are most definitely not for the beginner doesn't inspire one to continue. And the overly peaceful instructor with a preternaturally beautiful background stresses me out more than it calms me down.  I think that's why I like this dvd.  The moves actually are do-able.  And while clearly Ana Brett is ""in the zone"", she's not obnoxious.  The background is simple and uncluttered.  The narration is the right amount, speed is reasonable and there's just the right respite between each move.  I actually look forward to doing this workout each day.

Just one girl on a rug. Very boring... you never see the narrator who speaks to you weird - made me uncomfortable. The girl's outfit is slightly too small for her and her breasts are poking out of her shirt which also made me uncomfortable!!! She's got a weird smirk too. And as for the workouts and poses... just didn't feel beneficial, didn't really feel like yoga - it's not traditional so if thats what you're looking for this is NOT it. It is advertised as having four - 19 minute workouts and 2 meditations. Well... that's not true and that was my biggest disappointment. It's one very long video like 90 minutes, broken into chapters. So if you want to do one section, you come in in the middle of something already started and it doesn't end it just flows into the next chapter so cool down and stretching do not happen. You have to go back to the main menu and choose what you want.  They are not four - 19 minute either. There is one that's over 20, then one that's 13 minutes, then 8 minutes, and there aren't 2 meditations there are 3. I don't know what they were on when they made this but I didn't enjoy it at all and will be selling my copy to someone who thinks they'll like it!",1232323200,26,1371,4.134831460674158

I've been doing yoga dvds for a while and this is my favorite.  The breath of fire was a bit hard to get but now I find myself doing different parts of this during the day to give me energy.  Ana and Ravi are great and very supportive and informative through out.  It also helps to be able to pick what parts you want to do if you don't have the time to do it all.

I also had quit smoking and found that I desired to do the workouts because it leaves you feeling energized and in control that I dare not smoke again because I feared I would not achieve the same natural high from working out.

in the morning before breakfast, and then if time, do the rest in the evening, or the next morning if don't have a chance in the evening. It is broken into 4 sections, and if don't have time to do them all, can do just a couple of sections and still fit in a nice little workout. I love the way I feel afterwards, as well as really like the ""hands like a teapot"" meditation at the end, one of my favorite meditations of their's. The reason I like these workouts so much is that I actually enjoy doing them, and like the way I feel by the time I am complete. The only thing for myself that was lacking is that I didn't actually lose any weight on it (I have about 10 pounds or so would like to lose), even with doing this mixed with some of their other dvds very regularly, and being a mostly very healthy eater, so was disappointed in that. But I feel it has benefited me

Its a body of work w/o the head.

Reminds me of my very first yoga teacher who walked into the class and w/o a word said, ""We will start with the inverted dog position and then move on to the half tree position"". No introduction, no nothing. After 10 minutes of working under blind faith, I did not care if the inverted dog peed on the half tree and walked out of the class.",1230249600,20,525,3.9904761904761905

another issue i had was that i read Q & A addressed to Ana & Ravi addressed by a catholic who didn't feel comfortable with the chanting. she wanted to know if it was religious based. Ana and Ravi tried to avoid the issue and just answered that the writer should just be religious about doing the exercise, and the names chanted is actually an Indian deity - which means yes the chanting originates from Indian religion. there is no need to beat around the bush. they should provide the true facts.",1229817600,3,733,4.6461538461538465

But since I got over the quirks I have grown to like this DVD a lot and I will probably buy more of Ana Brett and Ravi Singh's products.

I fell in love with this DVD from the first workout!  I can hardly believe that I actually look forward to doing the yoga routine daily.  I've only been using it for about two weeks but already my posture has improved, as well as my balance and flexibility.

My favorite part is the relaxation and meditation after each exercise.  Ana demonstrates each movement so it is easy to follow.  Ravi gives excellent instruction so that once you've viewed the DVD a few times you can do it without even watching the screen -- which is helpful because many of the exercises are done with your eyes closed!  Ravi's voice is so soothing and I always feel both invigorated and relaxed after a workout.

The matrix feature is wonderful because  you can choose your favorite segments in the order you choose, or just play one or two if time is an issue.  I think the No Impact Aerobics and the Deep Relaxation segments are my favorites.

If you've been reluctant to try yoga, I encourage you to try this video.  You'll probably find yourself falling in love with yoga and purchasing more of Ravi and Ana's DVD's like I have!",1227398400,10,1388,4.522088353413655

Kundalini yoga is a whole different type of yoga~much different than the hatha yoga I was used to. It's very challenging, yet I feel so relaxed after I'm done. I feel loosened up from head to toe. It has really loosened up my spine and improved my posture. I feel like my sinuses clear up after all the breath of fire and I can breathe more deeply. My body literally hums for the rest of the day and I have so much energy.

I love that it is broken up into four short segments. That makes it easy for me to shorten up my workout if I need to, but I find that even if I only plan to do one or two of them I almost always end up doing the whole thing. Once I start I just don't want to stop. The time flies by!

I am not a novice to working out having done the whole gym scene, classes, running, etc and nothing has ever made such an effective and dramatic difference in my mind and body. I can see it in my mom too; she is actually EXCITED to work out!!! We are calmer, more focused, and overall happier! It goes without saying that we went ahead and got 2 more of Ana and Ravi's DVD's - Dance the Chakras, and Warrior Workout.

In only about 2 months time, we have lost weight and inches.

I have Degenerative Disc Disease, Spinal Stenosis as well as 6 protruding discs and 1 herniated disc, on top of that my body is being eaten up with arthritis. I also have been diagnosed with APS. All this at 39.

I tried a couple other yoga workouts and I thought they were boring. Considering before my health went down hill I was into kickboxing, the firm workouts as well as working out at the gym. I have modified to working out with Walk-away-the pounds.

One day I was searching online for different yoga workouts and came across Ana & Ravi's workouts. After looking at the reviews for FF Lose Weight & Feel Great, I decided to give it a try. I started with this workout the beginning of Oct. and was WOW'd
by it. Even though I have to do some modifications, I get an AMAZING workout.
Since then I have gone on to order everything they have. I still have Journey Through the Chakras, Dance the Chakras, House Calls, and Quick fixes on order. I do have to say I absolutely enjoy everyone. I feel so much more relaxed, and I'm already starting to see changes in my body.

At first, I was a little confused and bewildered at the content of this DVD. I had never seen anything like it!  But I kept an open mind and worked at my own pace. The one thing I can say is all that breathing really does make a difference!  Here's an example of how it worked for me:  I am a belly dance instructor, and last night I had to go teach a class, and I was completely NOT in the mood to go.  I only had about 3 or 4 hours of sleep the night before, and worked all day in the office doing my ""day job"".  I was exhausted and feeling pretty grumpy about it!  So I put in Fat Free Yoga DVD, and only did these sections ""tuning in"", ""energy breathing exercise"", and the ""start your engines"" (all I had time for).  I can honestly say that doing just part of the DVD made all the difference by the time I got to my belly dance class.  I had more energy, and I was so bubbly and happy!  I was making all the students laugh, and we were all having such a good time in the class.
  So that pretty much sealed the deal for me and my exploration of Kundalini Yoga.  If it can turn me from sluggish and tired to energetic in a matter of minutes, then I can only imagine what it can do for me in the long run!

2396740,4,B000AY6JVK,"This was my first yoga dvd.  i read such wonderful reviews so i had to buy it. i've had this dvd for about a month and i've noticed results! when i first put the dvd in, i thought it was a bit strange and was definitely not what i expected. i was skeptical that it would help me to lose weight.

my old exercise ""routine"" would usually consist of cardio... either jogging/walking or on the elliptical. i would do it for about a month straight with no noticeable results. my current exercise routine consists of jogging/walking for about 2 miles and then doing both the ""start your engines"" and ""fight fire with fire"". i used to do just the 2 miles but saw no results until i started doing the yoga with it. so i could assume the results would come without the cardio (but i like to do it anyways).

i gave it 4 stars because i don't really find the entire dvd beneficial. but i absolutely love the two sections i do. it doesn't get boring at all and i've become a LOT more flexible! yay!

I've started getting lazy and haven't been watching this all too often. But I love the Matrix because I still have to option of just doing a quick section if I want to.",1223424000,5,1165,4.2342342342342345

However, I think there is not a lot of direction or description about the organization and what is each chapter's purpose. Since the video is 90 minutes, it is not likely to be done in its entirety, so it would be helpful to categorize the sections so one can create an effective yoga workout with the necessary components and organization. Also, I read on other reviews about little or no instruction on the ""breath of fire"": I agree, you will figure it out but if you don't select the chapter which introduces this to you, you will be confused on some other chapters.

I am on medication but have been doing this DVD for a couple of months. I am losing weight slowly. I don't mind because it seems that my body is adjusting as I go, and I feel any weight loss I have achieved will be more permanent than fast weight loss would be. Also, I do feel better.

2396787,5,B000AY6JVK,"I wanted to try Fat-Free Yoga as a supplement to going to the gym. I really want to be more flexible and balanced, but I also wanted something faster and closer to a cardio workout than traditional posing/meditative yoga.

I wasn't in love with the first DVD of Ana & Ravi's I bought, Beginners and Beyond. But using the ""breath of fire"" (basically a panting kind of breath) makes these poses challenging and much more satisfying.  I've been doing the DVD before going to the gym and I feel like it gives me some energy and motivation to get in there and do a harder workout.

There are brief resting meditations between exercises, which really helped motivate me to finish the entire DVD, and some really nice relaxing ones in the intro and ending. I LOVE the Matrix feature and being able to set up the segments in advance.

There's very little yoga-speak about chakras, just very well-placed instruction and motivation. On one of the tougher moves, I started whining in my head, about to give up.  Then he narrated ""you may not love this move, but it loves you.""  Caught me, haha.

Although Ravi mentions it a couple of times, I think it's important to reiterate that you should go only as fast as you feel comfortable going with all the moves.  Because this kind of yoga can be jerky and it's more about motion than poses, I found it helpful to really watch and pay attention to the DVD the first couple of times through, then backing up to actually do the segment. And anything that went past slight discomfort into pain, I'm skipping for now.  I think easing into the DVD that way really cuts down on the potential frustration in the learning curve.

Looking forward to trying the Stretch & ""Warrior"" DVDs too :]

2396791,5,B000AY6JVK,"The time just flies by, and I get a buzz from this Yoga.

The first time I did Ravi and Ana's DVD's I was a bit afraid, particularly of the breath of fire.  This DVD made it seem like a natural way to breath. They do the breathing out loud so there is no confusion how you should be breathing.

I would recommend their ""Kundalini Yoga for Beginners and Beyond"" for the demonstration of the breath primer, though this ""Fat Free"" DVD is in my opinion more suited for beginners.  I recommend BOTH to start with.  ""Fat Free for beginners & Beyond is, in my opinion, a must-have.  I started with the ""Kundalini Yoga for Beginners & Beyond"", and ""A Journey Through the Chakras"".  The latter is such a masterpiece as well.  I read a review that it was worth the struggle to get through the exercises as best as possible. I've done that, and it has paid off.

I now have great arms, waist, hips, and thighs -- especially thighs.  I can do the duration of most of the exercises, depending on the day.  I have all of their DVD's except ""Am PM"". ""The Warrior Workout"" is the most challenging for me.  I love it now; it is my favorite workout for days I want to be challenged.

I went to a gym for awhile, and I could not find classes that could compare with these at all. At a Yoga studio I went to, the floor is hard, and the direction is without as much inspiration.  Ana does her Yoga on a little rug.

I like ""Beauty Body"", and ""Dance the Chakras"", and ""Bliss Hips"" for light to medium days as well.

The music on their DVD's is more and more superior over the years.  I am smitten.  I play the music in my car.

Back to the one I am reviewing, ""Fat Free Yoga for Beginners & Beyond"", there is everything from cardio to glands to cleanse.  Of course there is a bit of meditation after exertions, so it does not go too fast.  As usual, Ravi's verbal skills are apparent as he instructs with wisdom and clarity.  Ana is the perfect, and happy model as she demonstrates the exercises in a lovely set with her and Ravi in voice over with that incredible music.

The time just flies by.  There are some difficult moves that I cannot do properly, but I use props.  I use blocks, pillows, and a strap occasionally. I am 53 years old with curvature of the spine, and this Yoga has helped my back!

This is great value for the money, especially when purchased from CHAKRA44 seller.  It is worth a trip to [...] to see what Ana and Ravi have there about nutrition and fitness. Join their email newsletter, and receive great info every month.",1219449600,11,2524,4.270042194092827

As for the fat burning part- I think thats working too but at a slower pace. For a complete mind and body workout, this dvd deserves 5 stars.",1219276800,5,441,4.1395348837209305

2396808,5,B000AY6JVK,"Fat-Free Yoga is probably the best yoga DVD for weightloss on the market, and the only one that makes any sense! It has a cardio element, it works on the glands and other areas that standard exercises don't address at all, including the REASONS that cause a person to become overweight.
Ana and Ravi are very encouraging and you feel like they are really on your side and sincerely want you to lose the unwanted weight. On top of all that, they even manage to make the workout fun!
Even though I no longer need to lose weight, Fat-Free Yoga remains one of my favorite DVDs. It has a ton of stuff I like to do. I enjoy all four 'short' programs (each about 20 minutes) and while it's active, it's not So Challenging that you can't do it if you're a ""regular"" person, which I am. I'm so glad I have it because it works well as an add-on to other kundalini routines or as a long, more intense workout by itself.",1211673600,14,908,4.254335260115607

Well this is NOTHING like that. This feels like cardio yoga haha. it was an amazing experiance. during the dvd they will tell you what organs you are targeting with your exercise and i literally felt each specific area they said. the only problem i had is the discomfort i felt during some of the ""detoxing"" poses that helped clear your thighroid and other stomach glandes. i felt discomfort and thought maybe i wasn't doing it right since in Hatha that usually means change it up. Well according to this dvd discomfort will happen and means technically your detox is working. i think that's the only thing that might make you stop and take a break but after a while it goes a way. i did break a sweat and felt tired after it a bit and my body is kind of sore but im sure its because of my first time try. i highly recommend this dvd and i will be tracking how much weight i lose from this dvd.",1211673600,13,1060,4.252475247524752

The breathing can take some getting used to, but by the third or fourth time doing this DVD I'm much better at it. It's almost like yoga aerobics!

I was doing some traditional Hatha yoga, not as an expert or anything, but I wanted more and browsed Amazon and caught the reviews on the Ravi/Ana DVDs.  I ordered this one and For Beginners and Beyond and loved them.  Totally different feel from the Hatha and for me I FINALLY feel like I'm working my TOTAL self, INSIDE AND OUT.  HELLOOOOOO, I'm 63 years old, thin, healthy, and this is changing my body for the better.  I kept hurting myself doing weights for years so wanted another way to get muscle definition, especially in my arms/shoulders and THIS IS IT...along with the other SEVEN Ravi/Ana DVDs I've since ordered, received and use.  Now I have something for every day of the week and I can honestly say that this is the first time I've ever truly LOOKED FORWARD to my workout time.  I'm sure there are many other DVDs out there, but I'm sticking with these.  I also have Dr. Yoga House Call, Hips Bliss, Navel Power, Dance of the Chakras, Beauty Body (love it) and Warrior Workout.  By the time I was finished with that one, my muscles were shaking.  Awesome!  I feel energized, strong, yet peaceful. The encouragement, explanations and instructions are really helping me change my perspectives on who I am and what I can do, basically broadening my horizons by limiting what I see as limitations. Ravi and Ana have become like friends. And being 63, I want to continue to do everything I can to be the best I can be in very way.",1209513600,14,1502,4.485294117647059

2396819,5,B000AY6JVK,"So many great reviews on here and after experiencing this Yoga video I now know why so many of Ana and Ravi's videos are receiving such a great response. I had never tried kundalini yoga and have got quite bored from other yoga videos I have tried. This video includes four 19 min workouts plus 2 meditations, very easy to follow (unlike other yoga I have tried)
and I love how Ana and Ravi explain how the workout or certain poses optimize the glandular system, etc so you get a real understanding of what it is doing for your body. After only two workouts I felt a difference in my body and I am so looking forward to making this video a regualr part of my day. I am addicted to the relaxing meditations..they truly energize you and give you such a sense of calm and clarity. Having experinced problems with sleeping and emotional stress..I have found this video to be a wonderful sense of comfort and it has left me feeling much more grounded and hopeful at a time when I was struggling alot emotionally. This video can do wonderful things for your body and mind. I love Ravi's soothing voice which is very non intrusive and calming. Ana is a delight. She has a beautiful radiance about her! I was not sure if I was doing the Breath of Fire properly at first as it is something I have never seen before but I am getting the hang of it now and I find I can really focus on it. I think this video can really reshape the body and work well on problem areas. It is such a relief to actually enjoy a workout experience and enjoy it rather than just 'get it over with' which has been my attitude before:) You will be hooked on this video for the pure enjoyment and energy it inspires in you.

I felt it was needed to also do the Kundalini yoga to fully experience the clearing of chakras. After searching the customers reviews I purchased the Fat Free Yoga. My FIRST time ever doing yoga. I did the whole exercise and yes it was hard to keep up being 50 lbs overweight. I noticed that if I watched Ana while doing the exercise I was not able to keep up but, when I looked away and did the movements at my own pace it was easier. The breath of fire is hard and dries out my nose (LOL) but they state that your nose will get used to it. At the end of the program there is this one meditation where your feel sadness, anger ect. They show you a way to clear blocked negative energy. Let me tell you I must have had a lot of blocked energy because I started to cry as it was being released. Im not really prone to crying so that was weird for me. I was so drained after that I went to bed. Im going to try to be dedicated and incorporate this yoga everyday. Im sure it will get easier. I do really like the meditation after each exercise so I work harder to get the bonus in the end. I fully recommend this to everyone.",1207267200,14,1212,4.075313807531381

This is my first yoga experience ever. The movements are not too difficult, but there are several exercises that I cannot keep up & need to shorten a bit. I feel the movements are a bit lengthy in repetition, but I guess as you get used to it it won't feel so. Each movement is followed by relaxation/meditation which is like a reward waiting for you after a hard work. I think it will take a few more sessions to get the breath of fire right. I was looking for something to lose the last 5 lbs & wanted to try yoga... with no weights, steps & etc. If you need some type of equipments to do an exercise.. that itself becomes such a drag & discouraging. You definitely feel sore in the arms, ab & legs. I'm not so sure about the overall psychological effect that other people have raved about.. but overall.. I find this DVD an excellent choice.

Two weeks ago, I realized I'm ready to get myself back in in shape, and I was in search of something new.  I took a chance on this DVD, never having heard of Kundalini yoga, (what rock have I been sleeping under?), and I'm absolutely thrilled with it.

The workout is like a breath of fresh air.  I would describe it as a kind of yoga calistenics.  I love everything about it, the production is top notch, the music is interesting, and Ravi's voice is soothing.  Ana is so beautiful, and seems so genuine and likeable.
It is just perfect.  The moves are basic, simple, but the movement's repetition makes it challenging.  I appreciate the rest in between moves.  Afterwards, I felt invigorated, physically and emotionally.  I am so happy to be back to the place in my life when I look forward to exercise!!
I think I've done every type of exercise out there, and I don't think I could face another low impact aerobic or step-type workout.  It is such a unique way of working out, and you get it all - cardio, strength and flexibility work.
I've never done anything like it up until now.  I've never, ever recommended anything on this website before, (and I'm a good customer!), but this DVD and workout is so outstanding, I feel I must comment.

This DVD has been exactly what I was looking for.  It is challenging (I could barely lift my arms in the shower after the first two times I did it--lots of upper-body workout) but in a matter of two weeks you will definitely notice the new toning and strength in your upper arms.  I also notice that my thighs seem smaller.  I'm not really trying to lose weight but stay in shape, so this was just an added bonus to the COMPLETE and UTTER relaxtion I feel after doing this workout.  It's pure bliss.  Although it's meant to be done with the eyes closed, I do find it helpful to see Ana's abdominal movements as she breathes, particularly on the ""breath of fire.""  Once you get that pattern down, you can start focusing more on your own process and less on watching the DVD.

I did the whole 90 min tape nonstop, mostly because i didn't want to reach for the remote and spoil the ""high"" i was on. I would recommend this DVD series to anyone.

They're all 5-star workouts, and I rotate/combine them (or parts of them) with a couple of hip-hop cardio DVDs. The first day I did Fat Free Yoga I felt like I was smiling all day. It really put me in a great state of mind, which had seemed difficult to accomplish because I have been going through a difficult time in my personal life.

It is a unique experience that blends yoga, meditation, breathing, and pure positive energy together in one workout.  The music is great and I enjoy the things Ravi has to say as well.  The movements and breath work are designed to tune up your glandular system and get your body working better!  Breath of fire and deep breathing are so energizing and healing.  I immediately noticed changes in my energy and attitude and after only a few more times, I could feel differences in my stomach, core muscles, and posture.  Plus, I believe in the navel power that Ravi talks about.  Those core building moves give me added confidence and courage to tackle challenging tasks.  I love some of the moves enough to do them as a quick break from my computer during the day or while waiting for the tea kettle to whistle!

2396842,3,B000AY6JVK,"This DVD was my first experience of Kundalini yoga (I'm experienced in other styles, mainly Hatha). I found it strange but also intriguing. I'm attracted by the sense of lightness and fun combined with a meditative streak. Like others, I particularly enjoyed the meditation with hands like a teapot. But there are some things about this disc that bother me:
Early in the first set, Ravi calls for 'Breath of fire'. But nowhere on the disc is there any explanation of this method. I followed along as best I could, and later found a demonstration on U-tube by Gurmukh, which helped a bit. But I'm not sure I'm doing it right, as what I'm doing makes me feel a bit ungrounded.
Similarly, there's very little precise instruction on how to do the actual moves. You just copy Ana and hope for the best.
During one exercise Ravi's voiceover claims that any discomfort you feel in your neck is a sign that your thyroid is re-balancing itself. I'm afraid I find this difficult to accept. I trust my body, and I believe that pain or discomfort warns me that something is not  right.
The practice does leave me feeling energised but nowhere near as ecstatic as others here testify to feeling. Still, it's been an interesting taster experience and I have noticed that it has a decreasing effect on my appetite.
I suspect that this particular DVD may not be the best one of Ana and Ravi's to start off with. So I'm going back to brass tacks - I've ordered their `Beginners and Beyond' DVD, and am hoping it will cast some light on Kundalini Yoga for me.",1200873600,30,1541,4.543165467625899

Some of the poses are quite hard for me.  I am obese, but I do what I can.  If your overweight don't be afraid to try these.  I love the emotional release at the end.  This one is great for anger, fear, anxiety.  The ab work was good also.

All in all a exceptional body workout from head to toe, and emotionally healling as well.  I concur though with another reviewer who mentioned the regae like music at the end not being to her taste.  I do like rega, but it's very hard to meditate as the beat is so vastly off it's distracting.

Have I mentioned I've lost over eight pounds in the last two weeks with Ana's DVD's?  Two weeks with daily kundalini and I had rolls of fat on my back I worked at forever and now their 98% gone.  Amazing, I haven't a clue how as I used to do hour step classes and weight lifting and it didn't dent the fat.

Couldn't possibly be happier with my kundalini results; and to any overweight ladies or gentlemen out there these DVD's are great for fat loss, no jumping (can you say, ahmen) and emotional healing (part of why I eat).

I can't stop looking at the new me.  I'm starting to get a dancer's body.  Fabluous, you must try.",1199145600,106,1429,4.042857142857143

I have never enjoyed a 20min session so much as I did with Kundalini. I was totally new to Kundalini, which as a yogini, I admit, is ANYTHING but yoga. Having said that, it is truly its own thing, no words to explain this type of exercise. The breath of fire is the unique aspect combined with movements and music and pace that will get your real fires burning, followed with short moments of meditation, before next session starts.

If you are having stress in your life, I recommendmend doing any of the ana and Ravi workouts. I don't do my aerobis anymore, because it wear and tears down my body.

2396865,5,B000AY6JVK,"I have been meaning to explore yoga more closely for awhile, but never came across a teacher who inspired me to run the full gamut after the first or second time.

Since coming across Ana and Ravi's DVD, this sentiment belongs in the past. Despite the fact that today was my first day of exercising with the entire program, I'm hooked.  Here are the goodies:

1.  Ana's serene presence.
2.  Ana's well built strength.
3.  Ravi's soothing and encouraging tone.
4.  The music was well chosen for these exercises.  Stimulating without
  being overpowering.  I enjoy the beat...sets a wonderful tone.
5.  The Mind/Body/Spirit connection is a winning combination --
  I love the trio emphasis of getting the body well tuned, resetting
  the mind to a state of calm, and most of all, nurturing the spirit
  within.  It all comes together beautifully.
6.  Oh, did I mention variety yet?  There's no way you're getting bored
  during the routine.

I rarely post reviews on Amazon compared to the amount of reading I do.
I've NEVER posted one for an exercise DVD.....

2396866,4,B000AY6JVK,"It's a tough workout, especially when you first begin. But it helps you sweat and you feel like you've done a lot after. Not bad.",1182729600,8,129,4.2
2396867,5,B000AY6JVK,"Everyone wrote great reviews. I will only add I love the music... it's not dance music, but relaxed, but great beat so it's never too light. During parts you're doing the cardio, it has a great beat almost like Engima, but immediately changes to light, serene, slow during the meditations/rests.
I love you can always here Ana's breath to know when to breathe when you get distracted & forget. I love how Ravi talks, but never constant, but with great affirmations & telling you how each exercise helps your glands, organs, muscles, posture, mood, emotions, etc. to keep you going.
Though it's relaxed paced, he encourages you to go at your own pace, some of these exercises will increase your heart rate & good workout even if you just followed the movements & no breathe like an aerobics gym workout.
Because of the relaxed pace & breaks, this is good for anyone especially beginners who can get discouraged easily.
Some of the moves would be 1 legged locust, very low boat, bow, all whie breathe of fire (panting like puppy). Another is squatting & then to standing fwd bend & back down back/forth... Tehre are several that are sitting relaxed & moving arms up/down or moving neck side to side, or moving the torso side to side. These all really stretch out your various joints & since you should only go as fast or fast as you are able, not over push yourself, you'll be fine. There are also some ab building exercises as well.
The first hour & 8 min is the workout with about 10 second - 2 min breaks in between each exercise. The last 17 min is meditation to relax to. The chapter choices are great and during the workout, Ravi lets you know you can either continue or go to the menu & choose a meditation to end the workout.
After doing only 40 min of the exercises & no meditation, my skin was already more clear, less blotchy & my eyes looked clearer. My mood was also much more calm/relaxed. It took until the next day at a friend's house to notice I was breathing was significantly slower & deeper which is what was helping me to remain calm even though I was in a happy excited mood, because I tend to breathe kinda jerky & fast along with my jumpy mood normally.

I started yoga clense for my liver on new years day and immediatley felt like my thyroid improved.  I actually had to miss two days of medication because my prescription ran out over the holidays and I still felt better then ever, I couldn't believe it.  We then got Fat Free Yoga, because of the ""life is in your glands"" chapter"".  We have other Ravi and Ana CD's, but these two are my favorites.

I knew my thyroid was improving because my pulse rate went from 44 to a more normal 64.

I have never written a review on amazon, and told my wife that if my blood work proved my thyroid levels improved I would write one.  So here I am!

This is my first Ravi & Ana DVD, as well as my first Kundalini Yoga experience, and I immediately felt compelled to buy another. The first time I tried it, I went all the way through - it was tough, but I felt accomplished afterward. Each day, it has gotten easier and more rewarding.

I don't remember ever feeling this good! Even though I can't imagine why focusing differently with your eyes or doing certain poses would stimulate various glands, I have to believe it now. I feel energized and full of joy.

Even if you are unsure about the meditations in a spiritual sense, they are very practical as well - after doing a difficult exercise, it helps to relax for a minute before moving on. As hard as the exercise was, the strain erases itself, and all you feel is positive. I find this extremely helpful and comforting; without the breaks, I would have to pause the DVD myself and feel frustrated that I couldn't keep up.

Fantastic, amazing workout. I can't recommend it enough for anyone.",1173139200,12,1090,4.467336683417085

So at last I found this DVD!! It has saved my life- on many levels.  The first time I did the DVD I was so happy; at last a yoga that undid my spine!!  Then as time went on I saw all the other dramatic changes.  It opened up my energy (meridians/chi), it helped my glands so that my body would function again.  I can not say enough wonderful things about this DVD.  I have lost weight, toned my stomach, have more energy, & soothed all emotions.  Guess this is what spirituality is: the ability to no longer react to what is going on around us.  I now have all their DVD's and just spent time with them at a teacher training.  Truly amazing!

I am not in the best of shape and this is quite a workout for me. I welcome the short pauses between the series of more vigorous exercises where you catch your breath and ""consolidate your gains"". Also appreciate the short sets in both this and Kundalini Yoga for Beginners & Beyond. Am working up to doing the entire workout. Ravi explains the benefits and Ana is easy to follow because she is so precise in her movements. I have just ordered the Yoga Bliss Hips and Yoga Beauty Body (supposed to be good for men too).

2396878,5,B000AY6JVK,"I was encouraged by reviews to try some of the Ana & Ravi DVD's. I started with Kundalini Yoga for Beginners & Beyond which impressed me very much with its practicality, accessibleness, and pure enjoyment factor. I recommend you start with that one if you have not tried breath of fire. Ana teaches it in a breath primer. It takes a little getting used to for some but trust me - it is so worth it for the fat burning and abdomen toning effects which you will feel immediately! I can now tone my abs sitting in my car or at my computer!  Its not hard to learn - as Ana says, the breath is like a little happy puppy panting. They use this breath technique often with the poses. It is said to speed up benefits. it is also very energizing and detoxifying. People have been commenting on how clear my eyes are lately -  and all I have been doing is this DVD and Beginners & Beyond!!!!!

This, like Beginners & Beyond is extremely practical in that it covers all the basics and can be broken up into short sets. Do one, or as many as you like. All of them done together is one very challenging workout. This is authentic Kundalini yoga from India but some of the moves are very similar to pilates, and you will get light cardio too. This, and Kundalini Yoga for Beginners & Beyond are my best DVD's for all over fitness physically and spiritually!

I have ordered Dance the Chakras and Yoga Bliss Hips and can;t wait to try them!",1168732800,15,1425,4.286245353159852

I am usually pretty hectic (with two small children) so having four short 19 minute sets is perfect for me. You can start with 1 or 2 of the sets depending on your time allowance and work your way up to the whole thing which I have done on weekends. Either way, I have never felt better. This yoga keeps me energized and smiling!

This is the tape I always reach for because I know it works!!!!! (I feel muscles melting, strenghtening and leaning up. I am seeing muscle definition I haven't seen since my high school track training days!!)) and I know I'm gonna have a great time doing it. Ana & Ravi will definitely get your groove on! And you can't ask for more than that!
This was my first time with yoga and it really made me realize the importance of yoga in terms of mental, emotional, and physical health. I would never stop having it a part of my life again. I look forward to trying more of Ana & Ravis DVD's.",1168646400,12,999,4.257894736842105

My jeans are getting baggier in the butt and thighs and I don't even need to unbutton the button to pull them on and off:)

I really liked the four 20 minute yoga sets, they are short and sweet  -yet feel so complete by themselves so I know I will always reach for it often. I love the fact I can grow with this (you gradually work your way up to the entire workout - or if you are advanced do the whole thing already!)I love the low impact aerobics and the fact you don't need a whole lot of space since my workout area is small. I really love the music, Ravis voiceover and  ANA!! She is so cute doing her dance moves in the beginning and end!!!! Ana obviously is a trained dancer but there is something really friendly and encouraging about her, and there is no intimidation factor, somehow, like you can get with some other popular teachers.

My family is so proud of me for finding a workout that I can be disciplined enough to stick too(Ravi & Ana make it easy!).

I am actually very happy that my kids have gone back to school last week and I have been able to get back to my yoga routine!

2396883,5,B000AY6JVK,"Somewhat skeptic about losing weight through yoga, I purchased this dvd in May and I can't believe it, but I actually lost weight and my junk food cravings ceased.  Like that!  I lost ~11 lbs. in 6 months and still losing nice and slow.  I was informed that if I walked everyday in addition to doing the Fat Free Yoga 2-3, 20 minutes sets every other day alternating with the Navel Power set that I would tone down and shed excess weight.  While, following this regime, I didn't quite stick to my walking plan as I would have liked to.  Imagine if I had?

I am a HUGE Ravi and Ana fan.  I've attended several of their classes and all I can say is WOW!  Presently, I own 8 of their dvd's and just recently purchased their three newest dvd's (Hip Opening, Dance to the Chakras and Beauty Yoga) and didn't think that they could top themselves, but they have.

I love how I feel when I complete a set of Kundalini yoga.  Not only does it do a body good, but my mind as well as my moods all seem to be in harmony with one another.  It's almost like magic.  Don't expect to bend like a pretzel like Ana at first, unless you've been doing yoga for awhile.  Take your time and enjoy the process building slowly and seeing how far you've come in several months or a year.  And, don't expect a quick weight loss.  Take it slow and enjoy the journey noticing the little shifts in your life and body.

Thank you Ravi and Ana.

2396884,4,B000AY6JVK,"I just recently started practicing yoga regularly after giving it a try briefly several years ago. I didn't stick to it back then. I knew there was something to the mind/body connection of yoga but I guess my head just wasn't ready for the whole stillness aspect of it. I have always been an avid runner and enjoyed other intense cardio workouts (spinning, kickboxing etc.). My job requires me to do a lot of walking and standing while wearing a uniform and other heavy protective gear. That combined with high impact exercising was beginning to take its toll on my body. I decided to give yoga another try after reading about the benefits of ashtanga yoga in a magazine. I admit that I was concerned about limiting or even cutting out my other forms of exercise for fear of weight gain, but then I realized that I was always so sore and tired from those other workouts that I wasn't doing them as consistently as I needed to anyway. For about 2 months now I have been using a rotating line up of various power and other yoga dvds on an almost daily basis and I love them. Lots of muscle toning and I think my waist is smaller! More importantly I am finally getting the whole mind/body connection thing. It has helped me in other ways besides just the physical.

 I decided to try a few from Ravi and Ana's collection after reading mostly great reviews. Kundalini is definitely different from anything I've ever done in the past but I do enjoy their dvds. They are invigorating, somewhat challenging (I did work up a sweat) and most of all fun! I only gave 4 stars because I've only been doing them for a few days, maybe I'll check back in a few weeks for another review. I just ordered the warrior workout. I won't do these exclusively but it is a nice switch up to some of my other power yoga dvds with constant arm balances. A part of me will always love the movement of running because of the freedom it allows in being outdoors, but now I know there is something else that won't wreak as much havoc on my body. With yoga I've learned to be more comfortable with my body and not killing myself to look like a picture in a magazine. Now I just strive to be the best me.

By the way I'm surprised by some of the petty comments that people make in of these reviews.",1165881600,17,2266,4.339622641509434
2396885,5,B000AY6JVK,"This was the first Ravi Singh and Ana Brett DVD I purchased (own them all now!) and I fell in love with the workout the first time I did it.

The instructions are very clear and easy to follow.  Modifications are given when a particular pose might be too difficult for someone at a beginning level.  Ana does an excellent job of demonstrating each position and is an inspiring and beautiful role model.  Ravi's voice is soothing and reassuring and I like how he explains the benefits of the various poses.

Another nice feature of this workout is that you can do one twenty-minute segment or the whole workout, depending on your physical condition and how much time you have.  I started out doing one segment at a time, then did two, then three, until I could do the whole workout.  Now I do the whole workout when time permits, and just do one or more segments when pressed for time.

What I really like about this and the other Ravi Singh and Ana Brett DVD's is that they benefit me not only physically, but spiritually and emotionally as well.  Not only do I get a good workout, but I feel calm, centered, and at peace afterwards.",1164499200,9,1133,4.434782608695652

Kundalini has a long history of keeping the endocrine system--adrenals, pituitary, pineal, thyroid glands--healthy and functioning smoothly.

That said, even if you don't have any major concerns as I mentioned above, it's a great intro to Kundalini yoga.  I love the voice over by Ravi, and Ana is always in inspiration.  Five stars!!",1162684800,69,502,5.085365853658536

I don't have time to go to a gym but with this, I can just do one of the 4 sets in the morning, before work and feel energized the entire day. Really really love it - its more than I expect it to be. Some of the other reviewers thought the music and the set cheesy but I found it to be simple and the music relaxing and uplifting at the same time.

More about the DVD - its divided into 4 sets with 2 short meditation sets at the end. The first concentrates on metabolism, the second on the abs, the third is aerobics (it works you up into a sweat!) and the last is for the glands or your overall health. I suggest doing one of the sets and the meditation ones if you don't have time and have a hectic work schedule like me. Also, try to concentrate on the breathing and on the mind whilst you are doing the exercises, it would make you a much calmer person. On weekends, try to get through the whole DVD.

I think my life is much better for having bought and trying this. I have had it for about 3 weeks now. Its great when you are sad, angry, depressed. Its more than just about the physical aspects; its about healing your emotional wounds.",1156032000,13,1256,4.040160642570281

I'm not in very good shape, so I need those breaks to be able to do the entire workout (I didn't think I'd like this DVD because it is one of the longer ones Ana and Ravi put out). I am really, really looking forward to getting the other two Fat Free DVDs to add to my collection.",1154304000,24,596,4.146551724137931

I searched reviews before buying & I hope this will help you decide as well. I now have 4 DVD's & have a rotating weekly schedule that way.",1153094400,20,249,4.434782608695652
2396893,5,B000AY6JVK,"I don't know what it is maybe a combination of portion control, and my burning desire to get in fantastic shape for an upcoming event or,  maybe I can just give full credit to this tape  but my hips are really starting to change in a good way and my clothes are starting to loosen up on me. what ever it is, it's working.

My thinking is: somehow yoga gives the muscles a longer look. It sounds strange because it ""looks"" as though yoga does a sort of yoga version of many gym moves that tend to bulk you (or is it that the gym moves mimic yoga - I guess the yoga did come first!) but appearances are misleading. I find that holding those poses in a zone where the muscles stay active, makes the difference. The muscle is being elongated and strengthend at the same time, without facing the ""down time"" between the movement.

Then of course, there is the breath of fire factor which seems to be very aerobic especially combined with moving.

I love the 4 nineteen minute sets. I sometimes only have time for one set but still feel like I did something great for myself.  This one is my favorite along with Kundalini Yoga for Beginners & Beyond.",1152489600,33,1144,4.322429906542056

2396895,5,B000AY6JVK,"I started using this DVD with only the intention of getting in shape and losing weight, and I walked away with so much more.

Until now, I had never done a yoga DVD that was even remotely focused on meditation and breath as much as this one. It was like I had done yoga before, but had never really understood it until now.

I've only done the DVD once, all the way through so far, but I can tell you I'm going to be doing it over and over again for a long time. After one workout I felt more at peace with myself, my desire to drink coffee was significantly decreased (i've been trying to kick the habit for a couple months now), i was motivated to eat better, and i even felt thinner.

I also started out this DVD thinking it was too easy. Well, some of the poses seem simple at first, but they are challenging! It's been a long time since a yoga DVD made my arms and legs feel like rubber!

The great thing about this DVD is that you can stop at the end of any segment and skip to closing meditation. Each one is a workout in itself. What you do is up to you.

I'd recommend this DVD to anyone with an open mind. After you do this, you'll feel like you can go anywhere.

Until recently I have been a Power Yoga type of girl, you know Baron, Bryan Kest, MTV,  that whole gang. I have realized recently that I'm ready for something new.  I mean, how many  of the same down dog can you do?  Kundalini Yoga with Ana & Ravi came along at exactly the right time for me. With Ana & Ravi's DVDs there is no boredom factor, the workout is well-chaptered, since there's a short resting pose after every segment, I won't feel so  not quite done if I stop before the whole workout is over. Each section is complete so that I really know I have worked something thoroughly before on to the next.

I do mostly Ana Brett & Ravi Singh yoga workouts.  I really like their type of yoga because it feels very aerobic. It is a mild form of cardio that feels much healthier to my body then all that hard stepping up and down and running that I had been doing.  I have been amazed to see I have finally started losing weight and actually seeing some muscles in my arms legs, back and stomach - all former problem areas.

The only other thing I do, which is something I have always done,  is walking at a fairly good pace. I live in the city and take about 2 twenty minute brisk walks to the subway and back and then walking to do shopping. I am beginning to think yoga is all I need.",1148169600,13,829,4.006060606060606

I don't need to lose weight but still like to keep my metabolism humming which this definitely does. This is such a great workout done as a whole (there are four 19 minute segments) that I do the whole thing. It makes me feel great, gives me energy, confidence, and works on my glands to keep me young.

A matter of fact, the first day off the smokes I was filled with calm and grace. When stressed or yearning  I do the teapot breathing. This is my eigth day, so far, so very good.

I immediately purchased the Beginners & Beyond and Fat Free Yoga as well. The Fat Free Yoga is a great energetic workout which focuses on 4 different aspects of weight loss in four 20 minute sets. It has aerobic work, floor work, toning work etc. It works on balancing the metabolism and glands which is something I don't think any other exercise system can do.

I LOVE the way this yoga moves and combines the breath with the moves. I can literally feel my energy moving! Learning the techniques I learned doing this yoga and combining them with my pilates has brought my pilates to a new level. Now I really feel and see changes in my body and I feel more in control in all aspects of my life.

There are exercises done standing and on the floor and they all work your body and I guess glands and other body systems to rev your  metabolism in every which way. Some of the standing workout also involves vigorous marching in place so it is aerobic too. Also, something called ""Ravi Rolls"" with breath of fire.

I felt pretty achy the next day when I first did it. But fabulous the next. I realized there were many things my body had been  missing in my regular workouts. I have also seen a new clearness in my skin and less flushing. I think it is strengthening my capillaries. The floorwork has some regular stuff like crunches and not so regular stuff like holding a crunch with breath of fire (talk about intense!), so you are never bored!

Now after two weeks it's my best friend. I like the 20 min. segments and I know I'm going to get all areas of my body worked on.  I love Ana's demonstration and her freeform dancing in the beginning and the end and Ravi's voice, very calming. They are so uplifting and inspiring! As a complete beginner in yoga there were a couple of things that were somewhat hard, but at least I have something to work up to. Also, I've never meditated before and now I am wondering how I ever got by without it. Now I know why yoga is so popular, especially the Ravi & Ana kind.",1145318400,22,896,4.090909090909091

In my typical thorough fashion, I purchased many different

Yoga DVDs. For the most part I didn't get the concept of yoga.  I just seemed so, well, boring. Then I got this one. It's based on movement and breathing, and energy.

I love this DVD. The pace is just right and easy to follow. No unneccesary talking, yet Ravi's voice is very encouraging and Ana is a perfect inspiration!

The exercises are designed to affect the metabolism and help the body to work at peak efficiency. The workout isn't easy but its not too hard I find the abs and aerobics sessions to have some good intensity.

I feel like by slowing down and adding more yoga I seem to be burning more calories. I am feeling more like I did in my teens metabolism and health wise. I am also more limber.

I am on Amazon today to buy their Navel Power since I have heard it is one of their hardest DVD's and I think I am probably ready for it. If it is as hard as I hear then I may replace another aerobic session with that.

One more thing I love about the Fat Free Yoga is that it divides easily into four 20 minute sets so if you have a short timeslot you can easily fit in your Kundalini Yoga.

You should not hesitate to get this DVD if you want to add some really effective routines to your workout. Even if you are not trying to lose weight, just maintain like me, it is excellent!",1145318400,12,1389,4.0510948905109485

The sequennce of exercises allows those of us who are less like gumby and more like a gumball  to acheive a full workout and flexibility training without killing ourselves. , some of the traditional yoga positions put enormous pressure on your joints and extremities and are boring as you hang out in a pose for minutes at a time. This kind of yoga moves which relaxes the body and lets the energy flow. Plus it is a lot more engaging then simply holding a pose and hearing someone drone on about new age stuff.  Ravis soothing voiceover and Anas graceful presence and instruction make them a pleasure to spend time with. The workout is somewhat challenging, but is well paced and gives you ample time to achieve the benefits of each pose.

Ana is just wonderful, I love the beginning music and her movements seem so fluid and happy...made me smile just to watch her.

and the meditation at the end is (and I don't use this word lightly) brilliant, I found my self sobbing during the sadness part and then letting it go...exactly the way that I think therapy should be, no story just feelings...yet letting go of the story is often difficult and this easy mediation facilitates just that.

I am delightfully surprised that I look forward to doing this DVD yoga workout. As others have said in their reviews, it feels good to just keep going and I end up doing a minimum of an hour workout almost daily. In just a couple of weeks I was able to keep up the pace of the DVD. It's a good workout so don't be discouraged if it takes you a while to be able to do the exercises in their entirety ... did I mention I was 71?

Kundalini Yoga to me is 'yoga from the inside out'. It is not only changing the way my body looks on the outside, it raises my energy level and feels like I am balancing my body, mind, and spirit, with each workout. The fire breathing has opened my lungs and I find the explanation with each pose very helpful to understand what the exercises are doing for my body on the inside.

There are many good reviews on this DVD so read them and decide for yourself if you are ready to make a difference in your life ... I don't think you will be disappointed :).",1478563200,,1089,4.037037037037037
8080321,5,B000AY6JVK,"I have owned this video since 2010. This is DIFFERENT from any of the yoga classes you normally see in your gym or yoga studio. This is an OLD video so the lighting is Not the best, the resolution is Not the best, and Ana's clothing and makeup look old-fashioned.... Honestly, when I first got this video I was like... Wow, this must be from my mom's time, if not from my grandma's.... Well, I decided to give it a try regardless. Man, how it TRANSFORMED my body in just a couple of months!! So the main point is IT REALLY WORKS if your goal is to get fit/look skinny. Don't be put off by the old-fashioned and non-aesthetic aspects of this video. You just need to remind yourself of your goal of getting fit instead of focusing on the non-aesthetic part of this video.

They teach you an interesting way of breathing called ""breath of fire"", which I think is a NECESSARY component for this type of yoga to WORK. However, if you don't care for chanting and stuff, you can probably just do the movement and ignore the chanting. Also, there's a matrix function so you can design the workout the way you like and skip the parts you don't. What I like the most about this video is that the movements are Easy, Fun, Doable and Effective. I have owned videos and workout apps that are supposed to be very effective, but their routines are just too hard to keep up with for a non-athletic person (e.g. Kayla's SWEAT). Therefore, if you are an average person who wants to get fit/look skinny who is not super athletic, give this yoga routine a month or two. It won't disappoint.",1469404800,10,1570,4.3951890034364265
