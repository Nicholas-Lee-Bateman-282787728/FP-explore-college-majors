4387035,4,B004IM81KM,"I started bowling about 2 months ago.  I have bowled about 15-20 games in my lifetime and only could roll a 130 game if I was lucky.  I was a mess.  I finally bought a ball that was custom drilled and started learning to throw a hook.  I used online videos and forums to learn how.  Then I took a lesson from a pro. After practicing for 20-30 games, I managed to pull off a couple of games in the 160's and 170's. I only averaged near the 150 mark over those games.  I purchased this video and watched it twice and bowled about 25 practice games in the last 2 weeks using his concepts of timing, arm swing and approach.  My average over the last 10 games is up to 190 and I just bowled my highest game (first one ever over 200) today rolling a 244!  I think this video is a must for any level bowler as it gives you all the basics and then some that any bowler new or advanced could find useful.  I was disappointed to find the video does not cover how to pickup spares.  Overall I highly recommend this to anyone.  I'm a beginner and I've already rolled my highest game after practicing and utilizing the principles in this video.  This video is worth every penny!",1304899200,6,1165,4.151785714285714
4387036,5,B004IM81KM,"I have several books and dvds aimed at the novice, intermediate bowler. This dvd is the best of the lot for novice/intermediate bowlers, by far. Mr. Duke is an excellent instructor and the dvd is produced and then laid out very well.  The material is comprehensive, yet easy to understand when he has finished explaining the concepts. I have often reviewed specific parts of the video, when I've had trouble on the lanes and needed to understand what I'd done.

The only deficiency that I'd say that it has is on releases.  He does cover some different releases, but not in the depth that I desired. The release is very important and I'd have liked to have seen some slow motion of his various releases that he talks about. I don't think that the way he does it is poor, I just wanted much more, perhaps unrealistic expectations, because nobody does that, that I've seen and I have almost all of the bowling dvds on Amazon.

As I said, I have almost all of Amazon's selection of instructional bowling dvds.  If I could go back to the beginning. This dvd is the only one that I'd buy. It helped me more than any of the others that I have.",1303689600,12,1137,4.421052631578948
4387037,4,B004IM81KM,"Definitely the most informative video I have ever seen. I've been a league bowler for years and even had lessons by former PBA players. This will really help with fundamentals, set-ups, armswing, and almost everything you need to help improve your game. The only downfall is that it doesn't teach much about making adjustments for spares, oil breakdown, and oil carrydown. Overall fantastic video and by far the most informative learning tool for bowlers.",1303344000,2,455,5.162162162162162
4387038,5,B004IM81KM,"I've bought a few of the limited bowling dvds out there namely the Fred Borden and Ken Yokobosky dvds and the Parker Bohn.  This one is the best out of all of them.  It is the most modern (created in 2010) and is well done. Its is not a home made video like some of the ones I listed earlier. Grade A quality here.

If you are a beginner, then you may be a little overwhelmed.  But for the intermediate/league bowlers, this will definately help your game.  Norm breaks down the aspect of the game that most people don't quite understand like how to read the lanes, where to get your power, and the science behind bowling. The dvd is broken up into about 20 different topics.  If you are struggling with a specific aspect of the game you can easily jump to it.

If you search the bowling ball forums on this dvd you'll also find that the reviews were positive.  This dvd could be better if he spent more time on some of the topics.  I just wish it was a longer dvd.",1299628800,19,964,4.167567567567567
4387039,4,B004IM81KM,there was some very good information regarding all aspects of bowling and why things happen. I have seen many videos but this one had new information i've never seen before. Norm is a good speaker and makes it easy to watch.,1298505600,8,224,4.487804878048781
4387040,4,B004IM81KM,"This video is well made, the learning sessions are broke down and easy to follow.  The drills he explain have helped my daughter's bowling improve, as well as my own.",1433030400,,166,4.533333333333333
4387041,5,B004IM81KM,"This is a great bowling learning video.  Norm moves quickly through each lesson, so you have to listen closely.  In fact it is a good idea to listen at least a couple of times to grasp everything he says.  He does cover some of the fundamentals like how to determine where to start and the four step approach.  But he also covers some more advanced lessons like what happens to the lanes as a team or league bowls.

This is not a complete ""learn how to bowl"" video, but definitely a must have for your library if you want to improve your game.",1431216000,,543,4.233009708737864
4387042,5,B004IM81KM,After using his DVD I increased my bowling average from 165 to 185 over one year.  I'm sure that I could do even better if I received lessons from him in person.  Norm is an entertaining instructor.  I still like to refer back to the DVD to reenforce his lessons.,1426204800,,263,4.22

4387052,5,B004IM81KM,"This is one of those DVDs that shows if you want to master something, to you have to practice every bit of pieces & parts till you can put it all together in a professional manner. Now, not everyone is going to, nor they should, bowl like Norm Duke; but this DVD will show you little things you can do to improve your scores. I haven't had a chance to go bowling recently to put some of these practice but I've learned a lot. the DVD is a quick watch & easy to digest in an afternoon, but actually putting the skills to the test & learning may take a few months. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to take their average scores from 70s & 80s to higher - the sky ( well, 300 ) is the limit!",1399507200,,698,3.9574468085106385

4387054,3,B004IM81KM,"I bought this more than a year ago.  There are a few tips that I have successfully incorporated  into my game.  There are some areas I  need help with but there isn't enough detail on this dvd to be useful.  Frankly, there are a number of helpful, free resources out there i.e. YouTube.  I think the fancy production contributes to the high price.  I understand, no one wants to watch a boring, monotonous video, but keep the cost for content in perspective.  If I had it to do over again, I'm not sure I would pay for - tee for this again.",1392508800,,540,4.2254901960784315
4387055,5,B004IM81KM,This is better than paying for a lesson - it explains the essentials and easy to follow!  It is a great video!,1380758400,,110,4.0
4387056,5,B004IM81KM,"This is a great DVD for any serious bowler who would like to take their game to the next level.  With time and practice, following the suggestions Norm Duke presents, will certainly reap benefits.",1379894400,,196,4.764705882352941
4387057,4,B004IM81KM,Please know that while I have been a casual bowler for many years I have only recently started to take the game more seriously.  The DVD has a lot of good information on it some of which is either over-the-top or just too advanced for my current basic needs.  I intend to keep the DVD and use it as a reference as I hopefully will get better and am better able to understand some of the more advanced concepts.  Unless you are an experienced bowler who has all the fundamentals down I would recommend only watching this video a few segments at a time otherwise you may feel like you're trying to take a drink from a fire hose.  I would also highly recommend taking some private lessons or joining a league where you can benefit from the collective knowledge of those who are more experienced as no DVD can provide you with a personal critique.  $40 seems a little pricey to me.,1379289600,,877,4.355828220858895
4387058,5,B004IM81KM,"Just watching (a portion) of this DVD one time gave me enough tips to lead to my best series of the season (713).  Not incredibly profound, but solid, well communicated concepts that addressed my specific problem(s).",1370649600,3,216,5.0
4387059,5,B004IM81KM,"After viewing this DVD, I wanted more. Not because it was lacking but because it was produced with good video quality and techniques, had effective graphics, and had Norm's approachable personality throughout- peppered with a fun Norm-like sense of humor.

Norm, gives us a detailed description of what he does and why he does it- he is not dogmatic; where applicable, he acknowledges and addresses variation in style. He covers topics from finger fit all the way to pin reaction.

Before purchasing this DVD, I read a review (here on Amazon) that criticized the DVD for spending too much time showing Norm ""...hitting the pocket"", however, while viewing it myself, it became evident that the time spent showing Norm bowling was directly related to the topic being discussed; it was appropriate and within context (listen to the announcer)- it added visual communications to the visual learner- like myself.

With the many variables that contribute to a good bowling shot and a bad one, I am better armed to control, address and anticipate those variables. I am becoming a more consistent bowler, scores are rising and I am enjoying the journey- this video has helped.

With this production quality and style, I would love for Norm to produce an ""Absolute Beginner Bowling"" and an advanced ""Ball Selection and Drilling"" DVD.",1365984000,,1324,5.031963470319635
4387060,5,B004IM81KM,I have been a bowler for forty years. Twelve years ago I had to stop bowling due to multiple surgeries on my back. I was okayed by my doctor to do some light bowling four years ago and am now bowling in two leagues. My average has been in the 150's since coming back and I was not satisfied with that. My brother recommended that I buy Norm Duke's instructional video to help get me back to my old bowling self. I bought the disc and watched it about four times with as much practice as I could get in without putting too much of a load on my back. I bowled in the Senior's tournament four weeks ago and placed 14th with a handicap score of 742. Norm is a very knowledgeable instructor and a great bowler who has proven himself in many tournaments. He breaks the bowling game down to where a person like myself can understand and practice everything he teaches. I am very satisfied with the video and highly recommend to any bowler who wants to raise their game to the next level. My average is now 172 and climbing.,1364601600,,1016,4.242268041237113
4387061,5,B004IM81KM,"Learning from the master... who could ask for more.  My son is a bowling nut and loves this video.  I picked up a lot of interesting tips and tricks.

Norm Duke is a great player... we met him at a couple of tournaments and he is really nice and spends time with the fans that come out to see him bowl.

Nothing beats practice - and good equipment - but this will get you on your way!",1359504000,,384,3.948051948051948

4387063,5,B004IM81KM,"Norm Duke explains bowling concepts from simple to complex in an easy to understand manner.

I have watched the DVD several times and have learned something new each time.",1342656000,4,279,4.450980392156863
4387064,3,B004IM81KM,"This DVD is well produced with clear video. But,it is not for the beginner. Norm Duke is more of a straight line bowler. If you want to copy his style, he offers sound advice. There are too many shots of him hitting the pocket. We know he can bowl and that time could have been spent on basics like core size to rev rate ratios which would help in selecting the proper ball to fit your style, the proper sole material that would apply to various approach conditions, ball drilling, etc.
 I purchased my dvd at E-bay at a price that kept my disappointment to a minimum.
For the beginner to intermediate bowlers, Bill ""Hall's Bowling At The Next Level"" will offer more practice drills and more basic information.",1329091200,7,710,4.503875968992248
4387065,5,B004IM81KM,"I've read quite a few bowling books and also watched a couple DVD, youtube bowling instruction videos.  This DVD is really by far the best I've came across.  Duke really shares all his techniques, insights and tricks passionately in great details.  He is such a great teacher who can articulates his philosophies and keep you interested.  You will learn his technique from stance, to finish release and how to perfect the timing, aiming.  This DVD has improved my playing greatly.",1325980800,,480,4.95
4387066,5,B004IM81KM,My kids are on the high school bowling league. Some are brand new at this sport. This video has helped them improve their game. He teaches on the same basis as their coach. It helps for them to watch it instead of just hearing it. I do recomed this to all bowlers that want to kearn or help them make their average score much higher.,1325116800,,333,4.138461538461539
4387067,5,B004IM81KM,"This video is unique in that almost all skill levels can learn from it.  Norm has an engaging personality and his tips are easy to follow.  If you're a league bowler, this is more important than that new ball.  Get this first, then buy the ball.",1311120000,,245,4.282608695652174
4387068,4,B004IM81KM,"The good :

+ Easy acess, simple, straightforward.
+ Norm Duke
+ Topics covered are interesting and on details on basic principles of bowling that we sometimes underestimate.
+ Norm is efficient in explaining quickly his ideas. He doesn't comlicate things, and doesn't mention information that will be more confusing than productive.
+ The graphics are well made and help a lot.

The not so good (hey nothing is perfect) :

- I would like (for the price), more lessons and more topics covered.
- Perhaps some useful topics are not included.
- The subtitles are not the best quality.

Certainly the DVD will be an asset to many bowlers. Its not exactly for the begginer, even though some lessons are on the basics, but will definately help every other bowler. I would like to see a follow up DVD with more lessons on various topics not covered here, as listening to Norm and his view on them, would be quite interesting.",1311120000,,919,4.654320987654321
4387069,4,B004IM81KM,"Kudos to Norm and Storm for putting a product out that was worth every cent.
This is the most comprehensive video on the SPORT of bowling to date since the Don Johnson series. Don's tapes were made prior to the advent of resin (a.k.a. cheater balls) when a 200 average was considered PAR.
The Typical House Shot THS, and modern equipment are to bowling what steroids was to baseball in the 70 home run era. Be that as it may, how you finish relative to the field is what counts.

There's a lot of value here for new to intermediate bowlers. Note that as in many cases, the drills, tips,
systems that are conveyed in almost any bowling book or video are the product of years of experience, shared knowledge, and coaching.

Videos do not customarily list acknowledgements and thanks etc. I'm sure Norm would be the first to pay homage to those who have influenced his career. One such person would be Bill Hall.

If you are compiling a library of instructional material on the sport of bowling, add this one, it's a winner.

Others: Par Bowling, the Challenge by Thomas C Kouros, still the very best!
  The Dick Ritger Series, look at Ritgers drills and you'll how widespread his influence remains
  Focused on Bowling by Dr. Dean Hinitz
  Read & watch anything by Bill Hall
