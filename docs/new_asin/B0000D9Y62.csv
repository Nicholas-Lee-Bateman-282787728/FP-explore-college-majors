1921605,5,B0000D9Y62,"This film (T.V. program) is fabulous (and I don't use the ""F"" word lightly).  The production is wonderful as are the sets and recreation of the era.  MOST OF ALL the actors are superb!  However, the true stand out, as far as acting is concerned, is Diana Rigg--when she is on the screen all others are simply blown off of the screen!  That is some accomplishment since she is surrounded by great actors that are really into their roles.
This production is a treasure.  Buy it!",1083542400,4,476,4.488372093023256
1921606,5,B0000D9Y62,"I was channel surfing one night and happened to come across The Last King on A&E and have been obsessed with it ever since.  This is truly a masterpiece!!
The casting is wonderful.  The acting is brilliant. The costumes are gorgeous. The writing is captivating.  Every time I watched it, it was just as wonderful as the time before.  I opted to buy the DVD because I felt cheated when I heard it was a 4 hour drama.  A&E only had it as a 3 hour.  What wonders did I mess out on?!
There is nothing about this series that I didn't like.  It had the right balance of politics to help understand what a King's duties are-without making it dry and boring.  There's enough tasteful romance in it to keep it racy without being obscene.  I was impressed with the historical accuracy.  You CAN make a period drama interesting without compromising it's integrity.
I cannot say enough about this drama.  It is perhaps the best movie I have ever watched!!
My only question:  Did the king love the queeen?  Is that the reason he stayed married to her?
I can't wait until I get my copy so I can watch it again!!",1081555200,3,1097,4.344827586206897
1921607,5,B0000D9Y62,"There is a reason why the 16th and 17th centuries will always remain a popular choice as a subject of TV and film dramas.  With its topics relating to the rights of royal succession, familial conflicts, religious strife, morality, greed and a monarchy-in-chaos (and the occasional bodice ripping), these stories will always whet the appetite of viewers.
""The Last King"" is no exception.  Like the stories based on Henry VIII and his wives, Elizabeth I and Marie Antoinette, the story of King Charles II of England is filled with high drama and conflict that provides ample entertainment to viewers.  For the sake of oversimplifying, I would liken it to a cross between the film ""Elizabeth"" (starring Cate Blanchett) and the TV miniseries ""Tom Jones"" (starring Max Beesley).
When the story begins we find Charles in dire straits - he is in exile from his home country; his father, Charles I, has been murdered; and Oliver Cromwell now `governs' England.  Upon the death of Cromwell, Charles is invited back to rule England where he finds his country torn apart between Catholics and Protestants.  Throughout his rule, Charles II earned a reputation as the `merry monarch' - a man who loves art and music and counts gambling and women among his vices.  He collects many mistresses throughout his lifetime - most notably Barbara Villiers (Helen McCrory) and the actress Nell Gwynn (Emma Pierson) - and has a childless marriage with the Portuguese princess Catherine de Braganza (Shirley Henderson).  While he remains Protestant, his wife is Catholic and his younger brother (and heir) James converts to Catholicism, which only fuels the fire with the predominantly Protestant Parliament.
This topnotch production was co-produced by the BBC and A&E - the fine folks who brought us ""Pride and Prejudice,"" ""Tess of the D'Urbervilles,"" ""Tom Jones"" and ""Emma"" (starring Kate Beckinsale).  The production values, locations, costumes and casting are all excellent.  One of the main successes of this series, however, is the fine acting of Rufus Sewell (in the title role), Shirley Henderson, Rupert Graves (George, Duke of Buckingham), Helen McCrory and the supporting cast.  Since his early role as the brooding Will Ladislaw in BBC's ""Middlemarch"" to his funny turn as the hunky Seth Starkadder in ""Cold Comfort Farm"" and his malevolent portrayal of Agamemnon in ""Helen of Troy,"" Rufus Sewell has proven himself to be one of Britain's most versatile actors.  He does a superb job in portraying Charles as a charismatic and sympathetic yet deeply flawed and conflicted monarch.  Also, what sets ""The Last King"" apart from other historical-based dramas is how it successfully juggles the seriousness of the issues of the time and yet remains entertaining and even (at times) lighthearted.  There are moments of heavy drama but - as Charles romps about his court and/or seduces his latest mistress - also moments of 'cheekiness' and humor.
I thoroughly enjoyed this mini-series, which was shown in a full 4-hour stretch (including ads) in the US on A&E Network.  Fans of this time period may also want to check out ""Lorna Doone"" (starring Amelia Warner and Richard Coyle), an excellent British drama based on R.D. Blackmore's novel, which deal mainly on events following the death of Charles II.  If you are an anglophile, a fan of historical based films and particularly if you admire Rufus Sewell or Rupert Graves (""Forsyte Saga,"" ""A Room With A View,"" ""The Tenant of Wildfell Hall"") then you will certainly enjoy ""The Last King.""",1080172800,5,3521,5.088541666666667
1921608,5,B0000D9Y62,"With a life full of lust and intrigue, Charles II (1630-1685) makes a good subject for this A&E/BBC production, which is lavish and wonderful to look at.
The film begins at his father's beheading in 1649,  and after a period in exile, Charles becomes king in 1660; he soon after marries a Portuguese princess (Catherine of Berganza, played by Shirley Henderson) for her dowry, and though she never gives him a heir, it's a strange relationship that lasts.
Charles was more interested in wine and women than ruling, therefore was known as ""The Merry Monarch,"" but had some catastrophic events during his reign, like the Great Plague of 1665, that was soon followed by the Fire of London, that left much of the city little more than ash and rubble. The Dutch warships would threaten the coast, and the citizenry, usually referred to as ""the mob,"" and Parliament, making their anti-Catholic sentiments a problem when it came to his brother and heir, James.

Mostly this film centers on his mistresses, which are many. The most meddlesome is the lascivious Barbara Villiers, played with gusto by Helen McCrory, who also beds Charles' best friend as well as his son. As his best friend, the Duke of Buckingham, Rupert Graves puts in yet another outstanding performance, and Diana Rigg is terrific as his unloving mother, Queen Henrietta.
Rufus Sewell is superb as the king, and kudos must go to the makeup department for the very subtle aging throughout the film which adds to the believability of the characters.
Director Joe Wright and writer Adrian Hodges, with the beautiful cinematography of Ryszard Lenczewski and lovely score by Rob Lane, have brought us an entertaining view of this fascinating era of one of England's ruling families, with its sumptuous costumes on people who somehow always look a little dirty, fabulous palace interiors, numerous but tastefully filmed bedroom scenes, and some history too.",1079913600,112,1912,5.009433962264151
1921609,5,B0000D9Y62,This series met and exceeded my expectations. The scenes with Rupert Graves and Martin Freeman in full Restoration regalia alone were worth the purchase price.  Rufus Sewell's portrayal of King Charles II is subtle and nuanced.,1419897600,,227,5.305555555555555

1921612,4,B0000D9Y62,"Well, I was unaware at the time I purchased this DVD that it was an abridged version. I'm actually rather glad I didn't know, as I was able to enjoy it in blissful ignorance. Now, however, I would very much like to see the full-length version, so that I can see what I missed. In any event, I very much enjoyed this exploration of the life and times of England's ""Merry Monarch,"" or should I say ""Lusty"" Monarch? His bed-hopping does remind me of Henry VIII, but, as Charles himself, in the course of the story, makes eminently clear, he had no intention of abandoning his queen, Catherine of Braganza in the quest of a legitimate heir. In fact, the scene in which he refuses to do precisely that, is one of my favorite scenes, showing his loyalty to her in spite of his numerous infidelities.
I found the writing, acting and production values of this story to be excellent. Rufus Sewell makes a wonderful Charles II, displaying all the charm and wit we associate with that king, with a touch of poignancy when appropriate, and Rupert Graves is a perfect foil to him, while the rest of the cast is equally superb. The only reason for the four rather than five stars is the aforementioned abridgement.
Now, I wonder how many viewers were aware of the reason for the title, at least in it's American release? Obviously, for anyone even remotely familiar with English/British history, we know there have been many kings (and queens regnant) since Charles II. So why the ""Last"" king? The reason is that Charles was the last sovereign to impose his will on Parliament, in the matter of his heir. Parliament wanted him to legitimize his son by Lucy Walter, the Duke of Monmouth so that he could succeed rather than Charles brother, the unpopular, and very Catholic James. After Charles, Parliament took upon itself the right to determine who was eligible to sit on the English throne. Highly recommended in spite of the abridgement.",1411430400,,1926,4.66764705882353

1921622,5,B0000D9Y62,"I enjoyed this series quite a lot. Great costumes, palaces and other scenery and for the most part casting. Begins with the protagonist witnessing his father's execution, and briefly covers his exile in Scotland, before taking us to Charles II's triumphant return to England and his restoration to the throne. Rufus Sewell plays Charles II with just the right combination of force, cynicism, intelligence and self-assurance.
Here dramatically encapsulated is the digging up of Cromwell's bones and the arrest ordered by the king of all the regicides followed by their cruel execution at the urging of his mother, the redoubtable Queen Henrietta Maria (played by Diana Rigg) who makes clear she is not one for toleration.

It briefly depicts the Great Plague and the Fir of London, but mainly focuses on Charles Queen, the unfortunate Catherine of Braganza (Minja Filipovic), physically not very recitative, grave and soft spoken but with her own type of determination.
and of course Charles' mistresses. Helen McCrory plays a perfectly evil. lascivious and avaricious Barbara Villiers, Countess of Castlemaine. I absolutely adored the beautiful, sexy, vibrant and witty Nell Gwynn played by Emma Pierson, and an alluring Louise de Kroualle played by Mlanie Thierry.
Focuses on the tragic tale of the King's sister Henrietta Anne of England (Anne-Marie Duff). And some of the political conflicts and intrigues of the day with the king;'s brother James, Duke of York, (Charlie Creed-Miles) with his own religious zeal and stubbornness , the petulant Jemmy (Duke of Monmouth)(Christian Coulson) seduced by Lady Castlemaine and the king's loyal and fiery friend Henry, Duke of Gloucester (Sean Biggerstaff)
It was all covered very well and will be enjoyable to history buffs and simply lovers of good solid drama alike.
I especially liked the end where after the kings death the fate of his each person in the historical narrative is read by the actor portraying them.",1381276800,,1964,5.234920634920635
1921623,5,B0000D9Y62,"When I first saw Rufus Sewell as Charles II, I wasn't sure what to think- I like him, he's an excellent actor, but far more serious and mellow than I imagined Charles to be.  But within the first half hour of the series, my fears were put to rest- Sewell plays an excellent, accessible Charles II, and I can't really imagine anyone else as him now.

I love history, and today, restoration England is a chapter I'm well studied in; but I first saw this series several years ago, when I still learning a lot of about the era.  I enjoyed it thoroughly- and of course, with any historical piece, there will be a lot of artistic interpretation and creative license taken to make it suitable for audiences, entertainment, and for the sake of run time.  But Charles II has a lot of accuracy as well, and deserved merit for telling the story true to course.

I 'mention that I was not as well versed about the history though, b/c that explains why, when I first saw this particular version, I didn't notice the overall tone was amiss, and there was some pretty gaping holes in the plot lines.  There's a reason.

This version- the pared down version made for American viewers- is grossly negligent in it's editing.  A full episode short, the parts that were taken out were integral to the overall fluidity and entirely change the motivations of characters, and our understanding of them, in the film.  It's hard to believe that an hour could really alter the series so drastically, but the editing was done in such bizarre and cropped parts, that it really ruins the whole thing.

I recently had the luxury of re-watching this, but lucked out in that Vudu offered the original version.  It's my understanding that the original, full length version that was show on the BBC is not available on DVD- so I feel even the more fortunate to have serendipitously fallen on that version at Vudu (for $6.99, I now own a digital copy of all 4 episodes).

Almost immediately, I began thinking that I didn't remember this or that from the first time I watched it- and by the end of the four episodes, I was so glad I got to re watch it, as it was supposed to be seen.

The original is a gem, and well worth the four hours.  This version, however, is not- so please don't waste your money.  If you're a restoration/Charles II buff, you'll be disappointed and irked by all the inconsistencies; if you're fairly new to the era, you'll walk away with distorted understanding and incorrect ideas of who these people were, and what drove them.

The original covers the period of Charles II's life, beginning with his father's execution, to his exile, his return after Cromwell's death, and up until his own death.  We see the main players: his brother, and his marriage to Anne Hyde; his sons, including Monmouth; Lord Rochester and his other friends; his saintly but barren wife,Catherine of Braganza, and a litany o his mistresses, from the outrageous LadyCastlemaine, to the adorable and endearing Nell Gwyn, and the manipulative Louise de K&eacute;roualle.  Minette is featured heavily in the original, and covers her abuse at the hand of her husband, and her eventual death.  The story does take some liberties- implying that Charles did in fact marry Lucy Walters, making his son Monmouth technically legitimate- but this is inferred only by the burning of a paper that we never actual see the writing on, but presume to be his marriage certificate.  Minette's death is portrayed as definitely due to poisoning, and Louise de K&eacute;roualle played as a scheming, weeping, manipulative woman, though some argue this is conjecture.
The great fire and plague are well documented with other milestones, and throughout the four episodes we 're drawn into the never ending battle of the protestant and catholic causes, as well as Charles' fight to be an absolute monarch, free of parliament.

Despite those few theories that are presented as fact,t he film is really incredibly well done, and never drags.  I thought it was incredibly well-casted.  Helen McCrory does an incredibly believable portrayal of Castlemaine, as a person- both damnably likeable, and exhaustingly narcissistic & outrageous- and  in some scenes, , she even resembles some of her paintings by Lely- but i don't understand  what they did to her here.  She is beautiful  in everything else, and never looks aged even now, years later, in photos- but in this series, the makeup artists made her look like she was 50 from the start...  Her performance however, is superb and overall, this one inconsistency can be forgiven b/c of it.

An excellent series for any history lover, or Charles II fan, but only if you get the real version, as it was intended to be shown.",1366934400,,4712,4.747239263803681

This movie had alot of the same information in both books, but had some contradictions as well.

I was very disappointed in the casting of Lady Castlemaine. When I first saw her introduced to the king, I was like ""WHAT? Please don't tell me this is Lady Barbara Palmer!!!!!"" The actress who portrayed her was not at all attractive and too old and certainly not what I had in mind after reading that Barbara was the most beautiful, sensual woman in the entire court.  I think Frances Stuart was cast beautifully as well as Nell Gwynn and the Queen.

Ultimately, this film is unsatisfying because it is fails to provide context and continuity for the life of the influential and fascinating monarch it attempts to portray--it is more diorama than biography.  Actors in the major roles are never portrayed as aging--if it weren't for other indications that he was nearing the end of his reign, Charles's death would be a total surprise.  The only character development that rings true is the portrayal of the growth of Charles's respect and affection for his barren wife, Catherine of Braganza.  (The epilog might have mentioned that after her eventual return to her Portugese homeland, the widowed Catherine ruled for years as her brother's regent, loved and respected in Portugal as she had come to be in England.  She also plead with her brother-in-law King James for the life of the foolhardy Duke of Monmouth, her husband's illegitimate son.)

1921645,2,B0000D9Y62,"No, I didn't like it. First of all, Rufus Sewell is supremely miscast as King Charles II - he doesn't look anything like him. Charles II was a swarthy man, with very dark hair and thick lips. The producers seem to have thought that you can just put a wig on someone's head and that's it - but, in a biographical movie, the actor has to look at least a bit like the character he is supposed to be portraying (see, for example, Stephen Fry's Oscar Wilde, or Philip Seymour Hoffmann's Truman Capote - both of them superbly cast).

Then there were the stereotypes - all of them! The movie fell into every possible clich, sometimes even straying from historical fact, in order to maintain the viewer's interest. There was sex galore, but also cheap thrills from the very beginning (of course the young Charles could never have witnessed his father's beheading from under the planks of the scaffold - nor would it have been necessary from the ""emotion"" viewpoint: in ""Cromwell"", Alec Guinness, as Charles I, bids farewell to his children in a scene that is as heartwrenching as it is historically accurate).

And, lastly, the actress portraying Queen Catherine of Braganza succeeded in a difficult task - that of making that pious, quietly dignified woman who had to endure marriage to a womanizer look at the same time insupportably shrill and hopelessly stupid.",1215388800,6,1357,4.770212765957447
1921646,5,B0000D9Y62,"This film which begins with the beheading of Charles I follows the life of Charles II from the time he is a 19 year old exile in Holland until the end of his reign in 1685.

The film gets an overall top rating for the superb acting, sharp dialogue, excellent art direction and photography, and masterful costume, hair and makeup.  This last comment may seem odd until you see the hairstyles of Catherine Braganza as she arrives from Portugal or the make-up and styling of Barbara Villiers, Castlemaine, as she finally is forced out of the court of Charles II. The directors wisely showed almost all the primary male actors both wearing their overly abundant wigs that were popular at the time and then with shaved head when they were in bed or exercising.

The cast does an excellent job with Rufus Sewell portraying Charles II as a multidimensional and complex character. Charles II was continually put into difficult positions, such as returning to England to take the throne but under the condition that he forgives those who beheaded his father. His mother, Queen Henrietta Maria, played by Diana Rigg, is a cold and rigid woman who's advice doomed her husband Charles I and now she wishes to impose her outdated ideology onto her eldest son. Charles resists her fanatical assertions of absolute power as a divine right and carefully navigates a new world of shared powers. Charles II was served for many years by the wise Sir Edward Hyde, a pragmatic realist. Hyde is played well by the seasoned actor Ian MacDiarmid.  Hyde advises against declaring war against Holland whereas brass self serving Duke of Buckingham supports it. When the war turns out a disaster, Sir Edward Hyde must pay the price, a gross injustice. Yet as Charles II says, someone has to pay for the mistake and it can't be the king. He warns Sir Hyde to leave the country immediately before he is arrested. The relationship between Charles II and his best friend, George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, is very complex for Buckingham has a highly manipulative personality style whereby he screams in the King's face in attempts to get his way while claiming that these emotional outbursts are proof of honesty and willingness to engage with the king as a human rather than as a power center. Rupert Graves plays the part of Buckingham well. But what do we make of a man who wishes to share women with the king to ensure an emotional bond? What do we make of a man whose advice to the King is always self-serving cloaked as 'honesty'?  How does a man who manipulates behind the scenes and throws temper tantrums in public rise to such power with being born into privilege and capitalizing on the childhood friendship he has with Charles II. As sad and tragic as the exile of Sir Edward Hyde is the execution of innocent 70 year old Catholic, Sir Strafford, caught in an idiotic paranoid anti-Catholic political scheme and hoax. Charles II is forced to sign the execution papers for a loyal man that he knows to be innocent. The anti-Catholic paranoia ran deep in England through the reigns of Henry VIII, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, culminating in open conflict when James II is removed from the throne in favor of his protestant son-in-law and daughter, William and Mary. Eddie Marsaw plays the paranoid Titus Oates, a conspiracy theorists who would be perfect on contemporary talk radio with his wild exaggerations and lack of credible evidence for his claims.

Charles' relationship to Barbara Villiers, Lady Castlemaine, is very complex and is a central structure to this story. Both were probably sex addicts and yet years of sexual intimacy gave both Charles and Barbara considerable insights into each other's character. Helen McCrory plays Castlemaine in one of the best performances in the entire film. She had many illegitimate children with Charles II and plotted to undermine James II by sexually seducing and then inflating the ego of young James, Duke of Monmouth, the eldest illegitimate son of Charles II. Handsome Charlie Creed-Miles plays this foolish young man that is so easily influenced and refuses to be guided by the wise counsel of his father. The ability of Charles II to continually forgive those around him, such as his foolish brother James, Duke of York, or his illegitimate son Monmouth, or his old friend Buckingham, or his mistress, Castlemaine, is a key feature of the personality of Charles II. Charles eventually seems to develop a sense of benign indifference to those he loves, keeping them at an emotional distance and refraining from falling into their strategic plots and manipulations.

The 25 year reign of Charles II saw much drama including a disastrous war with Holland, a terrible plague in 1665, the burning of London in the great fire, and continual friction between protestant and catholic forces in his country. Despite all this drama, Charles was able to balance the power of parliament and the power of Louis XIV, the strongest king in Europe. In this regard Charles was masterful since efforts by the parliament to control him resulted in his bonding with Louis and maintaining loans and stipends from the French King. However, when the Catholic French camp became too overbearing, Charles would side with the protestant parliament. The film does a fairly good job of portraying this balance that Charles maintained to retain and use power.

It is in the relationship with Katherine of Braganza, played by Shirley Henderson, where the depth of the personality of the king is also observed. Their relationship goes through many stages but Katherine's strength of character eventually wins over the king who grows fonder of her with each passing year. She remains supportive of him in times in which he must make painful decisions, never trying to manipulate the situation for her own gains.

Overall the film gets 5 stars as does the super acting job of Rufus Sewell in the lead role. The original mini-series had one additional hour of film which has been cut in the A&E product, but none the less, this version is excellent and thought provoking entertainment.",1207440000,8,6105,4.885135135135135

The only reservation I have is over casting. I always imagined Lady Castlemaine (Charles' longtime lover) to be a sensuous, beautiful, radiant, yet shrewed (like businessman)court lady. But the actress who played her didn't fit the description. She looked like (from the beginning)one tired old lady without any charm and made me wonder why a woman like that was able to keep his affection for such a long time. Catharine the Queen had a weired accent...which was not how Portuguese speak English....
Louise the French mistress was marvelously cast. So was Nell, another mistress of the king's. My favorite scene was when Nell got out from her carriage and charmed the hostile people on the street. They thought it was Louise's carriage and were shouting to ""the French/Catholic"" whore to get out. Nell got out and said ""No, you are mistaken. I am his (King's) Protestant whore."" It was funny.

There was not enough emphasis given to the great love he had for the Arts.  Most of the pieces did connect but as a former review commented, there is something missing not much though.  Three hours is quite long enough to get the gist of the main points.  I got a real sense of the political pressure from Catholic France, from Parliament to keep a power hungry king at bay with financial ruin, and a moral mob to curb his immoral behavior which had little effect.  You can see the relationship and the severe trauma working in him as he recalls his fathers death.  He believed that aristocracy was more important than democracy and held firm in that belief until the end.  The one scene that keeps itself burned into my memory is Charles handing coins to a panicked and devastated population as the fire rages.  He looks up and sees a man in the tower pronouncing judgement of ruin on the king as the fire envelopes him. A deep sense of what the aristocracy is came to mind.  Armed with only coin and pomp, he was ignorant and helpless to actually do anything to comfort his people because he was too far removed from them given his lofty station in life. In that regard, I found it a very likable albeit long movie.",1170201600,2,1340,4.414634146341464

1921652,4,B0000D9Y62,"The Last King is not a regular period film where all can sit comfortably and watch from beginning to end without a pause. Stretching over three hours, it is too gorgeous a set to be compartmentalized into a mini-series; yet it is perhaps a little too long for a full-fledged film.

I watched the entire DVD in 3 to 4 sittings. The only flaw I could find after watching the entire production was with the beginning - I was quite uncomfortable with the jerky camera style and the biography took quite a while to gain momentum.

I thought the film started to gain momentum during the second half of Part 1, when there was a marked change in costumes of the English court, influenced by predominant fashion sensibility led by the French court of Louis XIV.

The costumes were first-rate, and they showed the replacement of long tresses with wigs in the European court, of which a variety of colours were in vogue.

The character of Charles II played by Rufus Sewell took time to find rapport with the audience but once it did, the effect was spell-binding, long-lasting and deep. Sewell's charismatic portrayal played an indubitable role in the success of the production.

The relationship with the Queen was an emphatic one, and Charles' lasciviousness and his weakness for women is always given a balanced portrayal against his deep respect for his legal wife, as reflected in history.

Barbara Palmer, Charles' long-time mistress was by far, the most obnoxious character I found - portrayed as an insatiable nymphomaniac that devoured men of all ages. Helen McCrory is hardly the ideal choice for her age and lack of facial resemblance - Palmer was reputed to be the most beautiful woman in court during her prime - her surviving portrait testifies to this. The incongruence in appearance and behaviour of Palmer as played by McCrory hardly endears one to her eventual plight when she was finally ousted from court by Charles, tired of her manipulations. But her performance was nothing short of marvellous and even though one soon tires of her duplicity and sexual appetite, one could not help but feel a tinge of empathy during the scene of her breakdown.

Emma Pierson as Nell Gwynn was a tad too modern and MTV-ish, but perhaps that was the intention of the producer - to make her a prototype feminist of sorts.

Louis XIV made a brief appearance and was portrayed as somewhat effeminate and over-powdered.

The title theme and the soundtrack is regal, binding and largely effective in augmenting the film's dramatic stature. I was particularly moved by the sublimity of the scene when Charles adamantly proclaimed his regal right, dissolved the parliament and walked out of the parliament, non-plussed.

The time-run of the production gives ample development for Charles' character and the viewer is pre-empted to discover the transformation and motivation behind Charles' final and secret conversion to Catholicism at his deathbed, through his disillusionment with the hypocrisy of Protestants in the parliament and the unwavering love of his Catholic wife.

The film gives a balanced account of both the politics and passion of Charles II, and should probably be one of the most comprehensive filmic productions on any monarch to have been made.",1156982400,6,3251,4.957720588235294
1921653,4,B0000D9Y62,"I very much enjoyed this four-episode drama about Charles II life. I think a perfect balance was found between the private and political sphere of the king: both was portrayed excitingly and vividly depicting his personality both as man and king with strengths and weaknesses as well. The Restoration Age, as its king, is shown in detail with its splendour and decadence.

A superb cast is empolyed including Rufus Sewell, Rupert Graves and the excellent Shirley Henderson among others. The music is beautiful. A documentary film about Charles' childhood and adolescence can be found on the dvd as an extra which is also worth watching.",1156204800,3,636,5.057142857142857
1921654,5,B0000D9Y62,"Absolutely immaculately filmed and acted 188 minute mini-series that originally aired (in a slightly longer version)in 2003 on BBC. More recently it has aired in America on A&E.

Rufus Sewell as King Charles II is in virtually every scene and though the history books label him the ""Merry Monarch"", Sewell  plays the king as a traumatized and perpetually stressed out monarch trying his best to keep his mother, his brother (James II, Duke of York), his bastard son (James, Duke of Monmouth), his friends (Duke of Buckingham and his cousin Lady Castlemaine), his mistresses (Nell Gwynne...), his Queen, Parliament, the French, the Dutch, and the mob happy. All while trying to recover those rights that Parliament stripped from his executed father.

Charles seems to know that the time of Kings is quickly passing but as a matter of family honor he never stops fighting for the divine right of kings.

The acting is superb even though history buffs might find some of the casting to be a little eccentric. Lady Castlmaine was supposedly the most desired woman of her day but the actress cast to play the role (Helen McCrory) is not exactly a knockout, in fact shes not much of a looker at all and is much too old. Also the Duke of Buckingham is played by Rupert Graves who is not formidable enough to handle the role. However some of the casting is inspired: Emma Pierson as Nell Gwynn is superb.

Some reviewers have stated that this mini series focuses on the kings mistresses and it does do a bit of that but I found there to be plenty of focus elsewhere as well. The question of the king's faith as well as the question of the king's succession seem to be the primary focus of television screenwriter Adrian Hodges script. And theres plenty of political intrigue as a series of advisers to the king rise and fall out of favor. The main lesson of King Charles II tenure seems to have been that the King cannot afford to have principles as Charles sells many of his most trusted advisers down the river whenever Parliament or the mob want someone to blame for the mismanagement of domestic or foreign affairs.

Sewell's star power probably makes us sympathize with the King even though as democrats our sympathies should be with  Parliament. The Parliament is just not all that likable in this mini-series, however, and we kind of suspect that during this era England was probably better off with a King than it would have been if it were run by a divided and contentious Parliament who knew they needed a king (even if he was only a figurehead) to unite the people.  Everyone in this mini-series is plotting something; it would seem everyone realizes that power is tenuous and no one stays in favor for long so you must take what you can get and run.

The king knows that after he is gone that Parliament will reverse everything that he has done and this and the fact that Hodges/Wright make it seem as though the King never really has any choice and that all of his major decisions are forced upon him makes us even more sympathetic with the king. It would seem even the king is a plotter but somehow since he is king and we suspect that he has Englands best interest at heart we forgive him for his covert dealings with France and his way of playing France against Holland and vice versa.

Charles II is definitely a Machiavellian who believes that whatever the King does is justified, but this is the very arrogance that the Parliamentarians cannot stand. It would seem that filmmaker Joe Wright (who also recently directed Keira Knightly in Pride and Prejudice) wanted to do everything in his power to show the king in a sympathetic light. If that is to be considered a noble deed then this mini-series deserves to be knighted.

I suspect that these mini-series that celebrate and romanticize order are especially attractive during times of political strife and division. Be that as it may Joe Wright definitely makes a mini-series that is exciting even if it is politically suspect. The recreation of London is very impressive. And the interior shots of Whitehall are magnificent. I only wish that there were a few characters that were representative of the common people and that we could have perhaps gleaned something of the common man's political point of view. But that is perhaps a small gripe in an otherwise imressive production.",1152662400,11,4345,4.696452036793692
1921655,4,B0000D9Y62,"Based on the title, The Last King is supposed to delve into the power and passions of one of Great Britains's more colourful monarchs, Charles II.  But this movie really seems to focus more on the passion side of his life, which consisted of a number of mistresses and resulted in the siring of several illegitimate children.  Unfortunately for Charles II, his legitimate wife, the devoutly Catholic Catherine of Berganza, could not bear him a successor, and this threatened to once again destabilze Great Britain.

Overall, I found The Last King to be a good and entertaining movie, but as is typical of A&E movies there's just something missing, and so it's not as good as it could have been.  There is a certain amount of sexual content in the movie, even a little bit of nudity.  Other reviews state that about an hour has been cut from the original for the DVD, but in my opinion it doesn't make all that much of a difference.  The DVD version still provides a sound overview of Charles II's reign.",1149206400,7,1003,4.606741573033708
1921656,5,B0000D9Y62,"THE LAST KING refers, I presume, to the last king not entirely selected and controlled by Parliament. That was Charles II, played here remarkably well by Rufus Sewell. Charles I was executed by Parliament and his son Charles went into exile and returned only upon the death of Oliver Cromwell. Being a Puritan-type, Cromwell had a rather depressing effect on theater, the arts and fun in general during his reign. Charles II had no such qualms and THE LAST KING portrays a liberated Protestant monarch who had many lovers while being fond of and keeping his Catholic queen. And ultimately, the conflict here is about religion, not unlike today. Except, instead of Islam vs Christianity, back then it was Protestant vs Catholicism. One was afraid of being ruled by the Pope and the other defended the ""one true faith"". In order to keep England Protestant, Parliament felt it needed to exert its control over the king. The intrigue all boiled down to who the successor would be to Charles II: his Catholic brother James or his illegitimate Protestant son. THE LAST KING has excellent production values, fine acting, a tight script and plenty of drama. The viewer sees a seemingly remarkably realistic slice of 17th century life. We learn that apparently many men wore their hair cut very short under their long, flowing wigs. There is plenty of bedroom business but it is always tastefully done, the power of the imagination proving again greater than the camera lens. I highly recommend this entertaining and absorbing historical-political drama.",1140480000,3,1545,5.01556420233463

Many Monarchs after him had power, influence, and the ability to run their country, and fight with parliament after him.  Anyone who likes British History though should watch this movie, it was interesting, and I recommend it.  But it needs to be kept in context.",1137283200,3,553,4.382352941176471

1921666,5,B0000D9Y62,"I was watching the featurette provided on this DVD of ""The Last King: The Power and the Passion of Charles II"" when suddenly there was a shot of a topless Nell Gwynn (Emma Pierson), one of the more notable of the notorious mistresses of King Charles II of England, posing for a painting.  I was taken aback because I knew I had not seen that particular shot in the mini-series I had just finished watching.  Of course, it did not take long for me to understand that this is the A&E ""edited"" version of the original programme from across the pond.  So, apparently if this is about ""The Power and the Passion of Charles II,"" it would be ""passion"" with a small ""p"" given the edits.

Actually, it should probably be ""power"" with a small ""p"" as well, since once he was restored to the English throne Charles II constantly complained about his inability to do anything without the strong advice and consent of Parliament.  The king was constrained by having to constantly reassure the lords of the land that he was neither his father, King Charles I, who was executed for having usurped the power of Parliament by proroguing the legislative body, nor his brother James, later King James II, who continued to be a devout Catholic in a land where the Church of England was the mandated faith.

The great irony of British history running through this story is that the same problem with plagued Henry VIII afflicts Charles II as well, namely producing a male heir.  The Stuarts were on the British throne because when the boy King Edward VI died in 1553 all of the branches the Tudor family tree ended in female, Edward's older sisters Mary and Elizabeth, to his cousins Mary Stuart and Lady Jane Grey.  Charles II produced several illegitimate children, most notably James, Duke of Monmouth, but his wife, Catherine of Braganza, was childless.  This made his brother, James, the heir to the throne, and having a Catholic monarch sitting once again upon the English throne was an anathema to both Parliament and the people.

Consequently, ""The Last King"" is about a monarch powerless to rule.  The title is interesting since it is for this U.S. production (you know how we colonials are: we could not watch ""Charles II"" until we had seen ""Charles""), but it does have some validity in that the case can be made that Charles II was the last British monarch who forced Parliament to listen to them; certainly he was the last king to send that body home and the Protestant members of Parliament were not going to obey James II.  Charles was known as the ""Merry Monarch,"" but unless most of what they excised from this version was the monarch making merry, Rufus Sewall does not provide the sort of royal party animal that Sam Neill played as Charles II in ""Restoration.""  The emphasis here is on the king's discontent.

As written by Adrian Hodges (who is working on HBO's upcoming ""Rome"" series) and directed by Joe Wright (currently working on a production of ""Pride and Prejudice"" to star Keira Knightly), this show is about an impotent monarch.  In fact, after conceding to the wishes of his mother (Diana Rigg) and executing those who tried and beheaded his father, you will be hard pressed to find a moment where the king accomplishes anything of significance.  Parliament controls his purse strings and when they want to execute the loyal Strafford for his Catholicism, he is powerless to prevent it any more than he could do anything about the plague but flee London or the great fire but examine the ruins.  His sex life is no less troubled.  Charles is unable to father a legitimate child by his queen (Shirley Henderson), is cuckolded by his chief mistress Barbara Villiers, Countess of Castlemaine (Helen McCrory), and fails to seduce Lady Frances Stewart (Alice Patten).  Even actress Nell Gwynn (Emma Pierson), is quite saucy for a former street prostitute dallying with the king.

Ultimately, this story is about the relationships between Charles and three characters.  On the one hand there is his ambitious mistress, Villiers, who wants to put their illegitimate son on the throne.  On the other hand there is the man who is supposed to be his friend and confidant, George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham (Rupert Graves), but who seems intent on playing the role of Judas on several levels.  In the end, it is in his relationship with his wife by result of an arranged marriage that Charles seems most honest.  Unlike Henry VIII, this king will not use divorce as a means to producing a legitimate heir despite the advantages of political expediency.  On his death bed Charles II converted to Catholicism, a rather stupefying act given the religious questions raised by his reign, but if there is a profound meaning it is not considered by this mini-series, for which it is but a footnote.

There is some attempt to approach the psychology of the man given that his father was publicly beheaded, but except for the beginning and the end of the story the specter of Charles I is implicit at best in the actions of his son.  Places and dates pop up at regular intervals to help you figure out what is going on, but apparently the producers were more accustomed to an audience well aware of their nation's history because many American viewers are going to be at a loss on some of the historical details.  But the sets and costumes are everything we have come to expect from such British efforts and the result is one of the better royal bio-pics I have seen in some time.  Sewall's performance is the best from him that I have seen, although I admit to be having had trouble in the past betting beyond the bad guys he has played in films like ""A Knight's Tale.""  Those disquieting thoughts have all fled now given his presence here.",1111190400,50,5731,4.69061876247505

My disappointment comes partly because A & E apparently has cut off one hour off from the mini-series. (you are left wanting more and wondering just what you must have missed!) ERRR!!!
What can be noted is that ""The Last King"" is not historically accurate at times, events that I know didn't happen (through reading the biographies of King Charles and others), or happened at different times in the King's life, appear here. I can understand that a historical drama needs flow, and it doesn't mar the production overall.  I would highly recommend doing more research into the many books available on Charles and others.
I loved Rufus Sewell and his performance, it is a MUST SEE for any fans of his. He is absolutely magnificent, and a handsome guy to boot. He really makes King Charles come alive.
I felt the mini-series focused a bit **too much** on the antics of Barbara Villiers (Lady Castlemaine) and the Duke of Buckingham. Okay, okay, okay,  I get the point, they are delightfully wicked, vile, and conniving, now let's move on already? Enough is enough, and too much is camp.  Charles was such a nice guy, what was he ever doing with her, you may think? (I guess this is where that complicated aspect of his character kicks in! LOL)This is really not a show you would watch with the kiddies, as there are *suggestive* (okay, a little more than that) scenes.
Catherine of Braganza comes off as a totally sweet and noble character, never quite saccharine or cloying, which is a bonus. Frances Stewart is fine as a character caught in the manipulations of a licentious court.
Nell Gwyn comes across *okay*, and maybe it was the actress playing her, but she didn't really come off as sympathetic to me. A little spiteful and immature, in my opinion.(I wanted to see more wit and less high school, like, you know, snarkiness) Okay, so she had nice legs and a fine wit, and obviously amused Charles, but I am left wondering of the appeal of some of the mistresses (okay, all of them)in the production. It's not necessarily the production's fault! (these women were who they were, that cannot be changed!)
 An actress with more grit and drive should have played Louise Keroualle, who, yeah, was **majorly** high maintenance, haughty, and greedy, but in not a delightful, ""the girl can't help it"" way portrayed here. Hey, girlfriend, ENOUGH! Poor Charles, what he had to put up with! But then again, he asked for it! (you could be shaking your head at this point in the production wondering about the state of Restoration male/female relations) Whew!!!!
I REALLY wanted to see more of his relations with his family, very interesting characters in their own rights. (I don't know, were there more scenes with his family in the 4 hour version? I really cannot say!)Maybe if they focused LESS on Lady Castlemaine they could have included more characters, or focused a bit more on them.
 Diana Rigg was wonderful as the Queen Mum though I thought she was really less rigid and more sympathetic in real life. Just me, I suppose, but the haughty matriarch makes for smashing good t.v. (LOL) The parts concerning Charles' son the Duke of Monmouth could have been better, as you may see. (I believe some scenes to be pure fiction, but check it out for yourself!)  What would have been interesting to see was Charles' life BEFORE he was restored to the throne in 1660. It would have been nice to see more of his relations with his children, or extended family members.
I definitely wanted to see more of Minette, Charles' beloved little sister and the woman who REALLY captured his heart. Her own life could make a great mini-series! A fascinating Stuart princess!
This is a very good production overall, and I would really recommend buying it (it's a nice romp through restoration times!)  I would of course recommend buying some other books,(for balance and perspective) such as Antonia Fraser's ""King Charles II"" (MUST, MUST READ!!!) ""My dearest Minette"" Letters between Charles II and his sister, the Duchesse d'Orleans. (MUST READ)",1090022400,9,4233,4.751020408163265

1921674,3,B0000D9Y62,"Other reviews have treated this DVD fairly, both in its good and bad points. The worst of all, as has been noted, is that for some foolish reason, A&E cut an hour out of the production. To add insult to injury the very first scene of the making of featurette shows a scene that does not appear in the American version.
Finally, why is there no captioning or subtitling in this DVD? Does A&E not care for the hearing impaired or those who don't understand the language of the period and might benefit from the subtitles? My wife is Japanese and can easily follow Brit dramas when she has subtitles to read. Another of my friends is hearing impaired, and neither could enjoy this dvd. I note the british video cassette has captions--wasn't able to find the information for the DVD.",1087948800,14,779,4.531914893617022
1921675,1,B0000D9Y62,"Wonderful costumes and sets and fine actors cannot help this miniseries.  It was torture to watch.  The story of this king is compelling and deserves better treatment, but the writers can't seem to do that, relying every 20 minutes or so on ""naughty"" suggestions of oral sex and lesbian exploration to keep the viewers glued to the set.  I love period dramas from the BBC, but this was a miss.",1086739200,11,393,4.585714285714285
