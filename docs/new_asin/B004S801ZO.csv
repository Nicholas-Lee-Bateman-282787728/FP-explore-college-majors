4462180,5,B004S801ZO,"I first saw this movie when it came to Seattle in 1985 or 1986. I had been interested in Japan for a few years and when I saw this film in the theater for the first time I was in high school. The film was so good I went back to the theater two weeks later and saw it again. It takes place before Japan entered WWII, but was already sending soldiers to China and South Korea. The story revolves around four sisters, the two eldest are married and they are taking care of the two younger sisters. They are trying to find a husband for the next youngest, and the youngest has a boyfriend who isn't liked because she eloped with him when she was just 16, and was promptly found by the police and returned home. The cinematography in this film is superb, so many shots are simply breathtaking and bring tears to my eyes. Of course the beauty of the homes and costumes as well. It is a somewhat serious film, but has its lighter moments. The film draws us into a world we may never be able to witness anywhere else. I felt I was indeed in 1930s Japan and in the very rooms the film takes place in. It does help to be somewhat familiar with Japanese culture or language to enjoy this film. My interest while in high school was enough to draw me in deeply. I still get emotional when I view the opening titles sequence, which was filmed at the height of the Spring cherry blossom bloom in Kyoto, at Heian Shine, it is such a beautiful scene. Also I fell in love with Sayuri Yoshinaga, who played the sister the older sisters were trying to find a husband for. She is still acting today, most recently in Kabei - Our Mother (2007). I can't recommend this film enough for anyone interested in Japan. Now that it has finally been released in the USA on DVD and Blu-Ray, I'm ordering my copy today!",1308009600,34,1786,4.2404692082111435

4462190,4,B004S801ZO,"I found ""The Makioka Sisters"" very interesting, while my Chinese girlfriend who usually loves Japanese film dozed off frequently. What interested me was the strong sense of propriety in Japanese culture during 1938. Always aware of the rules of their society, the characters of the story were vividly realized by the actors who portrayed them. This is a melodrama which one critic considered suitable for TV, but its quality is well beyond TV, even though the dramatic intensity of some of the scenes reaches the soap opera level.

The title of the novel evokes the image of falling cherry blossoms, and still shots of cherry blossoms at the beginning of the film were beautiful.  So were the scenes in the gardens, where some initial meetings with Yukiko's suitors took place.  Other shots were mixed. There was a scene of a meeting at a long table, framed by the edges of the doorway, which resembled similar shots in earlier Japanese films. I was somewhat disconcerted by the use of big closeups with dialogue, where varieties of over-the-shoulder shots or more distant shots alla Polanski might have been more natural. Did Ichikawa feel a need to emulate Godard? The cliched use of B&W for past scenes was less effective because the scenes were very short, with insufficient time to establish the atmosphere of the past.

Many critics didn't like the 1980s synthesizer score, and I liked it even less.  Some of the music sounded like tinny simplifications of Bach, and didn't bear repetition.

But the characters were compelling and interesting. The plot revolved around Yukiko, the traditional and lovely 3rd sister, with the story of the rebellious 4th sister Taeko providing the driving energy. She was interesting in her own right, but her stormy affairs with questionable men served to demonstrate the virtue of Yukiko's patience. This rhetorical presentation is the only justification for comparing this story with Jane Austen - I prefer to see the story in its own culture. The two husbands had interesting scenes, and so did the two older sisters, who represented a generation more concerned with maintaining the image of a family with a great reputation to protect.  The contrasting personalities of the pair of older sisters framed the main contrast between the pair of younger sisters.

I might have given this film 3 1/2 stars, because of its artistic unevenness, but I really enjoyed the characters and relationships at the heart of the film, and recommend it for its loving depiction of an upper middle-class Osaka family whose domestic traumas reflected major changes in a Japan that was reluctantly beginning to part with the fragile and artificial beauty of its past.",1398729600,,2688,5.024719101123596
4462191,5,B004S801ZO,"I really enjoyed this adaptation to Tanizaki Jun'ichir's novel! The cinematography captures the elegance of a bygone era.

Acting, direction, and cinematography are close to (if not) first rate.  Authentic Western Japan dialect (now and then). That's the good stuff.  Now the rest.  If you were native-born Japanese and lacked English language conversational skills (more and more a rarity today), imagine how, say, a BBC soap opera would come across based on subtitles?  Without being able to catch and enjoy much in the way of acting nuances, subplots, etc., would it appear to be just plain tedious, repetitious, and boring?  Probably.  Also an apt description of this Criterion disc version: it's tedious, repetitious, and boring.  The subtitles are vacuous and often incorrect.  The disc cries out for extensive supplemental material on what the film is about, the culture it recreates, the author of the source material, backgrounds on the director and lead actresses, etc.  If you lack Japanese conversational skills, work on your Japanese, and then re-visit the film in a few years.

This is a film adaptation of a well-known, highly revered novel and the casting of the sisters and their fellow life travelers was crucial to portray the subtleties inherent in the text.

4462199,1,B004S801ZO,"This film bears no meaningful resemblance to one of the greatest of Japan's 20th century novels - I was shocked at how poor this was. Despite being overseen by a Tanizaki descendant, there were some disgraceful changes to the details which fundamentally alters the meaning of the story. Overall, while the novel beautifully expresses the Japanese traditional spirit - the pace of the story is deliciously slow, decisions are made carefully, there is only circumspection and indirect, measured expression without melodrama -  the film is fully the opposite. I liken the film to a Japanese version of something that I could never watch but have seen clips of - US soap opera 'Days of Our Lives"". The film is packed with crying, underhand women, familial arguments, sexual tension, temper tantrums and falsehoods. In my nightmares, I could not imagine something that could be more in opposition to the subtle, luminous and tender feeling created between the sisters by Tanizaki in his novel - and, finding it unbearable, I turned this film off.
Apart from the egregious histrionic tones of the film (which any number of self-consciously arty shots of sakura blossoms cannot disguise) the most shameful betrayal of the book is that in the film, the deeply traditional, sensitive though determined sister Yukiko is portrayed as a coquette having some thinly disguised longing for her brother-in-law, Teinosuke. Teinosuke is filmed either looking seductively at her or staring at her like a stupid schoolboy. There is even a scene where Sachiko, his wife, confronts Teinosuke about being in Yukiko's room and helping her dress. None of this is in the novel - Teinosuke admires Yukiko's determination but that is it - nothing further is ever suggested. I cannot fathom why anyone would choose to change the nature of the key character of the novel in such a way, since it alters everything about the meaning of the story. It gives Sachiko a nasty motive to marry Yukiko off and Teinosuke to undermine her efforts - neither of which is even hinted at in the novel. In the novel, Sachiko is a dutiful, caring and concerned sister whose only duty is to see her sisters happily married and settled. The bitchiness and squabbling that the film portrays between the sisters has no place in the novel - it is a 1980s fabrication by a director who did not understand what he was doing. Nobody who has a love for this novel should touch this film. In fact nobody who has any genuine feeling for Japan - in particular the delicacy and subtlety of its language and relationships - should ever consider it.",1371168000,8,2587,4.879545454545455
4462200,4,B004S801ZO,"I've just finished watching this for the third time spaced months apart.  I like it a little more each time I see it.  It's a great character study, an account of changes in Japanese society as it moves into modernity and is very well-filmed.

The four sisters, who live together in the same household, appear to be about 15 years apart in age from the youngest to the oldest with the youngest being outspoken and rebellious while the oldest is very traditional and old-fashioned.  The film covers developments in each of their lives as well the relationship between them.

It does have the traits of a Jane Austin novel, a little bit like a soap opera and a typical Japanese family drama with a traditional and well-mannered flavor that reminds me of Ozu. The idea of a costume drama also comes to mind. If you are a student of Japan and Japanese film it's an important addition to your collection.

4462204,2,B004S801ZO,"Let me preface these remarks by saying I am an avid fan of Japanese movies and culture, having lived there for some years.
But I am not sure what movie the ""Editorial Reviewer"" saw, but this movie is in no way ""lyrical"" nor is it ""graceful"" as they write.  Rather the atmosphere is harsh overall.  The ill-directed actors show no acquaintance or even what I would rate as professional sympathy with their assigned characters.  Despite the high reputations of several of the actors, their performances here are perfunctory and wooden.  Now, of course Japanese roles are often seeming much more austere that Western ones, but here the margin is too great for comfort or enjoyment or edification.  The whole product is too cool for its own good: more like a Noh theatre performance of stylized gestures, and shouting taking the place of acting. If you want to see true Japanese families, who show traditional poise and yet operate with what all families must share in terms of care, affection and natural human warmth....look to Ozu's masterworks instead of here (or Naruse or better yet the recent ""Departures"").  I regret to say it, but this is a very disappointing movie.  Not recommended except for the exceptional color cinematography.

4462207,3,B004S801ZO,"Yes, this is a movie or rather ""study"" about a family of sisters coping with cultural change at the advent of Pre WWII. As a previous reviewer stated, the movie requires a great deal of patience. It is deliberately slow perhaps to capture the essence of an everyday, seemingly peaceful existance of a middle class family gone awry.

What I found difficult was not the theme of the movie, but rather how the scenes were filmed mostly indoors limiting the lighting, and most of the outdoor scenes seem to be filmed during overcast days.  Perhaps this was intentional but it made it difficult to watch the movie.",1322265600,,609,4.682242990654205
4462208,2,B004S801ZO,"I had high hopes for ""The Makioka Sisters,"" for three reasons: 1) I love serious Japanese cinema; 2) I enjoy and respect two of director Kon Ichikawa's earlier films, ""The Burmese Harp"" and ""Fires on the Plain""; and 3) the Criterion Collection almost always puts out great stuff. So imagine my surprise when ""The Makioka Sisters"" ended up being a massive piece of fluff! I'm glad I only rented it, and didn't just buy it sight unseen.

To be fair, I can understand why many people would like - or even love - this movie. It's a beautifully photographed film, and it has the aura of seriousness. But I couldn't help feeling that it's simply too long (clocking in at two hours and 20 minutes!), too melodramatic, and too superficial. Indeed, Donald Richie - the most influential critic of Japanese film to emerge from the West - has written off this film as a lame excuse to showcase pretty kimonos and ""poetic"" shots of cherry blossoms. While I don't always agree with Richie, I think he's spot on in this case.

Another major problem with the film is that the characters are thinly drawn and almost aggressively unlikeable (for example, witness how both of the elder Makioka sisters cruelly bully their servants). The oldest sister, played by the normally great actress Keiko Kishi, starts out shrewish and makes a totally unexplained conversion to being nice. The second-oldest sister, meanwhile, exists only to express shock at what her siblings are doing; I lost count of the number of times she gasps and exclaims ""eeeeeh?!"" in reaction to almost every little thing that happens around her. As for the youngest sister, I learned nothing about her except that she's a hellraiser (by 1930s Japanese standards) who likes hooking up with lower-class men. Her relationships with these men are never really explored, so they fall flat.

To matters even worse, the film has a very tacky, 1980s synthesizer score, and it occasionally lapses into music video territory, with arty-farty shots of falling petals or extreme closeups of kimonos abruptly jammed into the action. These strange touches severely undermine the movie's ambition to be a realistic domestic drama.

As for the Criterion Collection's DVD - it has a very attractive print but no notable special features, which is yet another reason to pass on this one. As an alternative to watching this, I would recommend almost any movie directed by Yasujiro Ozu, who had a unique gift for crafting beautiful domestic dramas. ""The Makioka Sisters,"" by contrast, is more like soap opera than art.",1316390400,17,2547,4.916279069767442
4462209,4,B004S801ZO,". . . But I did buy the laser-disk version a decade
or so ago. So this this review will be light in details.
Amazon keeps sending me emails to review it. Why?
I dunno. My bright light writing style?

The Makioka Sisters film is a domestic look at a Japanese
family circa 1900. I remember loving attention to detail
was given to depicting their home and gardens. They were
decorated in early traditional furniture augmented by western
tables and chairs, I think. Dad was a businessman (maybe a
banker). It's probably a good look at bourgeois Japan
becoming Westernized.

The story maybe revolves about the Makioka sisters marrying?
Perhaps the business about younger siblings marrying only after
elder sisters do? (I'm sure I'm not confusing that tradition with
KISS ME KATE; which is a lively romp. It's not at all that kind of
story; it's more like a very-well done soap opera. Women will
like it alot more than men will.

Great attention was given to detail. Very-well done interior and
exterior views; overall production quality was ahead of its time,
as I recall it. As this is a Criterion release even the laser picture
quality was excellent. The cherry blossoms really popped. Subtitles
were very readable over clear audio.

It's a view of times, mores, changing, soon to be gone. Sort of like

4462210,2,B004S801ZO,"This film version of a tender, graceful book mistakes bathos for pathos and calendar art for cinema. It was made as an ornament to Toho Film Co.'s 50th anniversary and, like some events with a big build-up,  is a chilling anticlimax. The star-studded cast are not capable of resembling a family of any sort, and certainly not the Makioka family, as Tanizaki wrote them. His book needed a classy scenario - what it gets here is pedestrian dialogue delivered in formulaic performances. Director Kon Ichikawa's camera does not know where it wants to be in many of the interior scenes. It tries every angle on for size. Nothing can come to life, cinematically, under this aimlessness. The art direction - the story is set in 1930s Japan - is perfectly evocative of 1983, when the film was made.

8439567,5,B004S801ZO,"Gorgeous movie. As you have probably read, it's a family melodrama taking place between 1938 and 1941 (which, we now know, was followed shortly after by escalation of World War II). I have not read the original Tanizaki story yet, so I will not weigh in on the nature of this screen adaptation. However, the film is a wonderful, swirling drama woven around the four sisters and their marriages and movements in an upper-middle class milieu. The cinematography and direction are just beautiful. There is a scene towards the end of the film that opens with shot after shot of kimono...just amazing. (It makes sense after a moment, but initially it is pure visual pleasure.) An unexpected thrill for me was noticing that the dialogue is in Osaka dialect! Delightful. For Japanese language learners, the mostly female (mostly polite) dialogue is easier to understand than samurai or noir cinema dialogue, too. Three of the sisters are fabulously spunky and willful. The fourth sister, indeed the person at the purported heart of this story, is in many ways the least interesting and most offputting for this contemporary viewer. Her character's performance of ""femininity"" includes scanty communication, a refusal to make eye contact, a lack of resistance to inappropriate overtures, and what seems like an unhealthy interest in other people's children. (I actually wondered if this person would be revealed to be mentally challenged, or similar?) But ultimately, I attribute that to cultural difference, and it makes me appreciate the vigor of the other three sisters' characters all the more. The relationship of the family to the servants is quite noticeable. It is a constant reminder of the class position the Makioka family adheres to, and probably there is more context for this in the original story, which I will now have to go read. Final note - the eldest sister's husband is played by Juzo Itami, who, a year after this film was made, directed the first of many films (The Funeral, Tampopo, A Taxing Woman) before his untimely and mysterious death.",1521849600,3,2056,5.032258064516129

The plot is Austenesque, involving the marriages of a group of sisters. I strongly suggest reading the wikipedia article on the film before watching it. This tells who the sisters are, and what their age relationships, etc. are. Without having read this, we would have been quite baffled by the movie. And even so, we thought that something had gotten lost in translation: until seeing the plot summary just now here, I didn't realize that the sisters were in the kimono business: I just thought they were rich and owned a lot of kimonos. We found this most interesting as an artifact of Japanese culture and less than an emotionally engaging story. The high point was the interviews of prospective husbands, especially the hilarious dinner with Mr. Nomura, which had us laughing out loud (listen for the kimono squeak).",1462579200,,988,4.957831325301205
8439573,4,B004S801ZO,"The Makioka Sisters is a gorgeous, beautifully shot film. The director has filled this movie with attractive scenes of sakura blossoms falling from trees, showa era style homes, stunning kimonos, rain drenched walkways, and plenty of striking images depicting bridges over water. These gorgeous visuals provide the colorful backdrop to the world of the four Makioka sisters, wealthy siblings who run successful kimono business.
The conflcit here is quiet.the sisters are to marry in order of age. The two eldest sisters have married but the rebellious fourth sister is stuck. Sister number 3 is shy, timid and unable to make a connection with any man.

Reading the reviews I cannot argue with the criticisms of this film. While the film is set in 1930's Japan it was made in 1982 and the synthesized film score reflects that. It does not bother me and in fact being nostalgic for the 80s i embrace it much like the synthesized score to Educating Rita. I cannot also argue with the argument that not much really happens here. The sisters are wealthy and the are plagued by ""rich people"" problems. As a character study it is interesting how none of these women would consider themselves bad people even though ther are by today's standards awful to their servants and disconnected from reality. This  however was their world - time of Kimonos, the emperor, and a social structure that has fallen away.
