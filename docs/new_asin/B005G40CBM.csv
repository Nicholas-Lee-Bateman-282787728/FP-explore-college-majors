8471071,5,B005G40CBM,"I worked at each of the Supercross events in 2011 and interacted with most, if not all, of the people in this film. The Bar To Bar series provides an accurate and intimate look inside the world of Supercross. While not all of the aspects an athlete's personality can be conveyed, what you see here is on point. Don't expect to see each full-length race, what you get is a recap of the action, suspense, and drama the occurred throughout the season. Again, not every detail can be capture, but the film executes a solid portrayal of the most important incidents relating to the championship.",1464048000,,590,4.628571428571429

8471074,5,B005G40CBM,"I love Ryan. He's a champions champion. If anyone could have possibly beaten Carmichael in the days, I believe that it would have been Ryan Villopoto. Bubba Stewart is faster but in an on the edge reckless kind of way. Ricky Carmichael was fast in an on the edge dogmatic push it till he at the checkers kind of way. Villopoto is both of those guys combined.",1410998400,,358,4.358208955223881
