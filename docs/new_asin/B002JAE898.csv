8371333,5,B002JAE898,"If you have any questions about what you are taught from childhood about religion and the start of Christianity, this DVD will help at least to spark an even greater interest. As a seeker of information about why we are here, and one who is now open to another thought process, I highly recommend this program. Didn't you ever wonder why or how the 'religion' we practice came about? Do you listen blindly and not ask any questions? Jesus was not a Christian. He was a mystical Jew. His followers were very diverse. Three hundred years later the ones with the most power at the time invented the religion we call Christianity, and they put together a book of their preferred texts we now call the Bible.  They chose to burn or destroy any text that they deemed outside of their personal agenda. Some survived to tell another story. Maybe these new texts were closer to the 'real' Jesus agenda than the Holy Bible. At least be open to the possibility.",1439510400,2,950,4.555555555555555
8371334,2,B002JAE898,"It certainly holds your attention, but for a faith driven person it is rather uncomfortable. The series tries to explain it as if 3000 yrs ago there was no God but everything can be scientifically explained. I am faith driven and I believe in God and Jesus Christ. This series just made no sense. They believe The Red Sea parted  but through science not God. It just happened at the moment Moses was there . Scientist miss the point. They are not looking at it spiritually.",1398124800,2,473,4.5
8371335,5,B002JAE898,"A dvd that clarified many questions re:biblical mysteries.  Each episode was logically explained.

I will share this DVD with many of my friends.",1374796800,,145,5.260869565217392

8371337,4,B002JAE898,"The Lord Yahweh works through acts of God disasters through the ages, especially at present.  what they showed failed to explain how the river turn to blood, the lakes, ponds and all the pools of water were blood.  The Egyptian magicians only made matters worst when they proved to Pharaoh they can perform what Moses did. A cloud of smoke from the volcanic mountains, sound realistic. As the angel of death, killed all the first born is more than nature in itself. Miraculous divine power was at work.  Science cannot explain how God would manipulate nature to the edge.  The departing of the red sea has been found, it was not located at the shallow area.  It was a little further towards the deep. There were chariot wheels found and a path way under the sea towards which is now Saudi Arabia.  This was the biggest miracle that cannot be explained by science, because it was literally God's invisible hands that departed the sea.  You could say that the Lord used wind to make a path way from both sides of the wall.  From the bloody water, than nature took it's course except when God took Pharaoh's son.  This was the biggest break through, but it hardens Pharaohs heart with blindness to even see that the God of Israel is the all mighty one.  This DVD is good reference but does not answer everything in what was recorded in the Torah.  Sodom and Gomorrah and the Lost Gospels was explained well.  There is Scientific explanation concerning Acts of God that was aggravated combine with Godly intervention.  Suppose Pharaoh, became a believer.  Yahweh can turn the tides around.",1287187200,,1585,4.675090252707581
8371338,2,B002JAE898,"This review refers to Biblical Mysteries Explained: Exodus. The narrator states at the end of this video that scientific theories can account for the Exodus story, EXACTLY as described in the bible. This is clearly not the case. A few examples illustrate this point.

The bible says that the Nile turned to blood. Not that it turned to a color that looked like blood, as the theory proposed here suggests.

The last plague was the killing of all the first born of Egyptians. The theory suggested here is that the food became contaminated, and the first born of Egypt, according to ancient custom, would get a double portion. Only they would be poisoned by the food. I don't know if this custom really existed. But it doesn't really matter. The passage that they ignored here is the passover. Look at Exodus 12:23--""For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you."" The criteria for being killed (or not) had nothing to do with being poisoned. The criteria is the presence or absence of blood on the door. The Lord is making his rounds throughout Egypt, and allowing the destroyer to kill only those who don't have lamb's blood smeared on the doorposts.

If the theory stated is correct, then 'the destoryer' would have to be the poisoned food. So let's reword the last portion of Exodus 12:23--""the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the [poisoned food] to come in unto your houses to smite you."" Not only does that not make much sense, it makes less sense in light of verse 29. The Lord comes in at MIDNIGHT and smites all the Egyptian first born. The smiting happens in the middle of the night. So The Lord goes to the house of an Isralite at say 1:00 AM, sees the blood, and doesn't allow the poisoned food to enter that person's house to kill the first born. What??? (Of course all ancient Israelite first borns are getting up for a late night snack at that time.)  ;-)

There are some interesting theories, such as the parting of the sea happening on a very shallow portion of the sea...apparently there is a raised area, and a very strong wind exposed that shallow area. That seems like the only plausible theory in the whole program.

I've seen a few shows like this that attempt to describe biblical miracles in scientific terms. I think they're missing the point. I believe the bible claims that its miracles are just that...events that defy scientific explanation.",1281657600,13,2577,4.579175704989154
8371339,5,B002JAE898,The idea that the scientist were able to discover the date and time when the Sodom and Gomorrah had happen is amazing!,1274659200,3,118,4.409090909090909
