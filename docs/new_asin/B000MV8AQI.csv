2749956,5,B000MV8AQI,"Though I am not, nor have I been a big fan of old school kung fu movies from back in the day, I must say that this one was a delight. The story was excellent, the dubbing was good, and the action was fast and entertaining. Not quite what you would expect from the old school movies, but if this is a common trend among Shaw Brothers movies then I intend to buy more!",1434412800,4,366,3.9594594594594597
2749957,5,B000MV8AQI,Big fan of the classic kungfu movies,1433721600,,36,4.285714285714286
2749958,5,B000MV8AQI,A classic movie that I have been looking for for a while now. It is bringing back a lot of memories of all the movies I used to watch asa young lad.,1382054400,,148,3.65625
2749959,5,B000MV8AQI,"First off, I almost didn't give this movie 5 stars because the print on the VHS is a little poor.  That being said this is a great movie.  Yes, there are movies out there that look slicker and probably have better fighting scenes and some even have crazier training sequences, but the kung fu is just part of the fun here.  I'll spare everyone a plot synopsis since that's been done in prior reviews.
Basically what made this movie fun is that I liked each of the six main characters.  They all have their own personalities that are distinct and pretty well developed given the limited screen time each gets (a rarity in films like these), and they're all generally likable despite their faults.  In particular the rapport between the two ""strong guys"" and the interactions between the two light skill/pole experts is a lot of fun.
By the way, the one liners in this movie are classic:  ""I don't have to eat eggs!!""
Bottom line...get this movie!",1027036800,2,945,4.595238095238095
2749960,5,B000MV8AQI,"Fans of 5 Deadly Venoms, Masked Avengers, Flag Of Iron,Kid With The Golden Arm, will without a doubt love this film. Without giving away the entire story a short synopsis would be, the Manchus pit North Shaolin against South Shaolin in bids to get them to fight one another, there is plenty of action, excellent training sequences, and a great story which is easy to follow.  I have seen many of the Venom stars movies and I must say I actually enjoyed this one a little more than the others. I would definetly recommend this movie to be part of your collection.",994809600,5,562,4.509803921568627

2749980,2,B000MV8AQI,I love Kung Fu movies!! And I've seen this one. I would watch all the Kung Fu movies on Amazon but the majority of them and not englished dubbed. There is a place here in town that sells Kung Fu movies with the english dubs. Sub titles require me to miss the movies because of all the reading necessary to keep up with the storyline. You would think with all the money that Amazon makes they could at least put the Kung Fu movies on there sites that have the English dub to them.,1479168000,3,479,4.1063829787234045

2749983,5,B000MV8AQI,"Most of us who've enjoyed The Five Deadly Venoms acknowledge it as one of the best films Kung-fu cinema has ever produced, and its influence on other films, including other films of other genres, is well known. Five experts of the Poison Clan abandon their master to use their incredible techniques for personal gain: the Centipede, the Snake, the Scorpion, the Lizard, and the Toad; and sent to observe or terminate these men is a sixth pupil who's learned a little of each style, making him, as the saying goes, ""a Jack of all trades, but a master of none."" Venoms is a classic, no doubt, but we come to the pupils only after they are experts themselves, only after they have become who they are. Invincible Shaolin resolves this: though released in the same year as the Five Deadly Venoms, think of it as Venoms' precursor, as taking place years before the six pupils go out into the world, before the five are corrupted by it. Actually, what's fascinating about Shaolin is that, while featuring all six stars of Venoms and the styles they would use in that movie, it is not a prequel but a stand-alone story. Here we get to see how Snake's puncturing technique was developed; as well as Toad's great strength and armor-like skin; and also Lizard's nimbleness and leaping abilities. The training sequences are ample, detailed, and amusing, culminating in a fifteen minute battle royale that has what will become Snake style vs. Scorpion, Centipede style vs. Toad, and, lastly, Lizard style vs Jack of all trades. Chang Cheh's masterwork is indeed The Five Deadly Venoms, but unquestionably that honor also goes to Invincible Shaolin.",1476662400,,1636,4.825622775800712

8172634,5,B000MV8AQI,I originally saw this as a teenager in the 80s and realized what film this was with the Toad loving eggs (until he didn't) and the snake learning to obtain power from short distances.
