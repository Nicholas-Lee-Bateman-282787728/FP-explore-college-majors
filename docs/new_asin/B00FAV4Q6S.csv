8613919,5,B00FAV4Q6S,"The Jason Gibson DVD course ""AC Circuit Analysis Tutor - Volume 1"" arrived after having been on order for about two weeks.  It was packaged well and the associated DVD disks are in mint condition.  I'm still working on the very first one of the tutorial DVD that Mr. Gibson produced to provide beginning and advanced training on electrical engineering and technological data.",1475193600,,375,4.936507936507937
8613920,5,B00FAV4Q6S,"If you wish to learn electronics, math, calculators or a host of other subjects then follow Jason and You
will never be disappointed. Truth be told, Jason Gibson is the real deal and only getting better!!",1394323200,2,204,4.694444444444445
8613921,5,B00FAV4Q6S,"This is the 6th vol of Jason's circuit analysis set, and the first one that deals with Alternating Current or AC analysis.  Between this and the other 5 volumes of the series you make it just to the end of the first semester, with the only major thing not being covered is the OP-Amp material (the operational amplifier circuits).  However if you understand Node Voltage, which Jason covers extensively in one of the earlier volumes, you have most of what you need to know for that.  Some classes, depending on your teacher, may get into some of the material in the chapter of the book after this material, but it is really just an extension of this stuff.

As for this volume, it basically boils down to phasor analysis, and impedance.  Jason starts off however with a very good review of sine and cosine material, and then does a review of complex numbers.  It is the stuff you need to know to understand phasors which are usually stuck in the appendix of the book and explained very poorly.  The good thing Jason does is he introduces all the notation using the more familiar i complex number and then switches to j at the end of the discussion.  Whereas the books launch into the j notation and rearranges things and it is hard to follow.

Once he goes through that foundational material, then he shows how the KVL and KCL along with series/parallel reductions all apply to AC circuits and goes through many examples of how to solve circuits using those concepts to find the voltages and currents in different parts of the circuits, and how to switch from the time domain to the frequency domain and back.  He really does unwind the complexity that the book gives, and also reenforces (or clarifies) class lecture because he spends more time on the basics than your teacher likely has time to.

I own many of Jason's DVD sets and the absolutely help if they fit your learning style.  For those who are visual and/or auditory learners it is the best investment you can make to get all the material confined in one spot and not have to try to go hunting through youtube to find examples.  You still do need to go to class because Jason does not go into every fine detail that your instructor may go through, but he gives you the high level knowledge of the material that you must know to deal with all the details.",1385683200,4,2316,4.511961722488039
