7807753,5,6300256375,"I bought this movie for one reason and only one: there was Jeremy Brett in it. The story is watchable; I can't say it's a very good movie, and Jeremy Brett was rather miscast: such a charming man is not very credible as a sexual intruder. And he was too young in body and mind to be abble to be frightening. Nevertheless, I'm not disapointed; if my DVD were broken, I would buy another immediatly. A large part of Jeremy Brett's work has still not been released; a part of it has been lost, perhaps destroyed, it's a pity. If we can have a movie where he play's, let's catch it!

7807754,4,6300256375,"A British thriller from 1963, this movie concerns a young wife who is the victim of a psychotic stalker.  Filmed in Hitchcockian style, it kept me on the edge of my seat.  Not only does the story concern itself with the stalker, but also the terrifying events cause the main character (played wonderfully by Anne Heywood) to reexamine her own deep inner feelings and her personal life as well.  A young Jeremy Brett makes an excellent psycho--hard to believe that many years later he would bring the wonderful detective Sherlock Holmes to life as no actor has done before or since.  If you like old-fashioned thrillers, you will love this movie.  The fact that it is in black and white seems to add to the atmosphere.  A nice film which deserves more attention then it has gotten.",1015286400,8,780,4.656934306569343
