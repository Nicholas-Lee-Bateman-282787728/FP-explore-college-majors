8715639,4,B00XBL0KT6,Good program. This is mostly about the Sage Grouse. Not a great show if you're interested in the entire sage steppe ecosystem.,1461888000,,126,4.7727272727272725

8715641,5,B00XBL0KT6,Very well done.  Actually I visited the area in June 2015 and the documentary is right on.  Students viewed it with enthusiasm.  Students were amazed at the vastness of our western states.,1447200000,,188,4.8125

8715644,5,B00XBL0KT6,"This DVD was an eye opener when it comes to getting an insight into the seemingly open and dead appearing look of sage brush country !  For any one who loves nature documentaries this movie is well worth watching and owning since the photography is very well done in my opinion, especially under the harsh winter conditions sometimes shown. At first, when deciding on the purchase of it, I thought why don't they have a Blu-ray version of it.  The subject matter as described in the write up of this movie however, was interesting enough for me to go ahead with the purchase and I must say I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this disc when viewed on my 75""  UHD TV !  So any one with a smaller screen TV will surely be very happy with the quality of this DVD disc.  Go ahead and buy this disc if you are into nature documentaries, especially when it happens to be a movie concerning things happening in your country's ""back yard"".",1437955200,,942,4.421965317919075

Sage with twisted shrubs and deep roots survive in the most extreme weather from high desert heat to freezing cold in some 300,000 square miles of ecosystem, in eleven western states in North America called The Big Empty. Sage brush live for some one hundred fifty years at altitudes above 3,000 feet which is considered a high desert, a place of scares water, where 60% of water comes from snow. Pronghorns migrate within the sage and these antelopes are the fastest sprinters in the continent, adapted to outrun any big cat including the long extinct American cheetah. Western grouse can only be found in America. Male grouse may live up to four years and can pass their genes only for two summers so fights between males are ferocious. Scientist counted a single male grouse mating 37 times with 37 females in 37 minutes while fighting all other males in between those 37 minutes. With those oil rigs popping all over the Big Empty as well as humans and farms, it is not difficult to see why the number of these majestic American bird has dwindled to only couple hundred thousand from millions with a future as uncertain as the vast wilderness of the beautiful sage ecosystem of the west. Well done documentary, superb cinematography and well matched narration by Allison Argo. Bravo.",1432252800,3,1400,4.765432098765432
