8297574,5,B001ECDZHS,"Ferenc Erkel is mostly known for his two operas, BANK BAN and HUNYADI JANOS, neither of which is widely known by the American operatic public. KING STEPHAN is even rarer. This production, a film made about 30 years ago by Hungarian Television, is quite colorful, filled with episodes from early Magyar history. Mise-en-scene, singing, and general direction are fine. However, a better introduction to Erkel's oeuvre would be BANK BAN, arguably his finest work. Still, KING STEPHAN is certainly recommended to the adventuresome opera fan who's looking for new avenues and musical experience.",1327190400,3,590,5.354838709677419
8297575,3,B001ECDZHS,"Compared to many Italian operas this particular opera lacks drama.  The music doesn't develop during the production; there is a marked thematic similarity regardless of the character or action.  As noted by the previous reviewer this production is a film with actors synching to singers.  According to the package information some of the roles are sung by the person in the film, but the major roles are sing by a different person than the one seen on the screen.  Color balance is uneven, many of the scenes have an orange - yellow ""wash"" over the entire scene.  It is unclear to me if this was intentional or not.  The settings and custumes are lavish.  If you have never seen a boar hunted on horseback this production has it.  In general I enjoyed the DVD, but it is not one that I will be viewing more than once or twice.",1307404800,2,826,4.496644295302014
8297576,5,B001ECDZHS,"A Hungarian television production from almost 30 years ago is transferred successfully to DVD here.  This is Erkel's last completed opera, the story of the historical figure King Stephen in Hungary's history.  It is filmed in full costume indoor and outdoor sets, with horses galloping, near-battle scenes with large crowds, Church scenes, and an outdoor Hungarian royal wedding, all beautifully filmed.  As this is a television production done as a movie, there is no concert stage, and consequently no audience present, unlike most other opera DVDs.  The actors, well cast in the roles, sync to the music.  All of the vocal roles are well sung, and the orchestra and chorus are of a high standard.  There are no Act breaks, and the whole thing is completed in just over 90 minutes.  (The box states that this is an opera in two acts, though other sources list it as being in four acts.) The music is up to Erkel's high standard, though not as intensely dramatic as ""Bank Ban"", but more inspired than ""Hunyadi Laszlo"". If you're unfamiliar with Erkel's music, imagine middle period Verdi opera sung in Hungarian.  For the best introduction to his music, I would recommend listening to the Hungaroton CD set of ""Bank Ban"" first.
I would recommend this to all lovers of nineteenth century opera.  The DVD doesn't come with a written libretto, but there are of course subtitles available in a number of different languages.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1225497600,16,1447,4.89344262295082
