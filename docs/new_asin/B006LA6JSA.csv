8500316,5,B006LA6JSA,"Journey to Jemima is an exquisitely produced documentary about the search for family and the power of love to transcend loss.  You will love journeying with this family throughout the myriad of experiences and emotions inherent in the process of adopting internationally.  Through it all, you will find love and pain along the way, you will laugh, you will mourn, you will shed tears of joy.  The authenticity and vulnerability of everyone in the film draw you into the story they share.  As a mother of two internationally adopted children, I have recommended this film to countless couples considering adoption.  No matter how many books, films or workshops adoptive parents experience, nothing can prepare you for the emotions that you will experience when picking up your child. Bradley and Dawn Gregg's honesty, raw emotions, insight and wisdom about adoption stealths its way into each frame. They prove in story form how love defines us even more than our genes do.  Adoption is many things; it is love, it is hope, it is fear, it is anticipation, it is sadness, it is heartache, it is loss, it is beauty, it is redemption.  This powerful and moving film captures every one of these emotions and shows how true love, instant families, the heartache of happily ever after and joy comes in the morning are all part of the wonderful redemptive spirit of adoption.",1428537600,2,1367,4.891774891774892

8500318,4,B006LA6JSA,"My guess is that if you are considering purchasing this video then you are also considering adopting from Kazakhstan and wanting to see what it is like to travel there and go through a little of the process. This video does a great job at showing some of the emotions, challenges, and ups-and-downs of adopting there. You will see what one of the orphanages is like and also a little bit of the country. The video quality is not professional and I would have liked to have seen more introduction to the couple since I know NOTHING about them. It also doesn't show much about the adopted child's first days in the USA which would have been helpful. Overall, it is an interesting documentary and I recommend it to anyone considering adoption from that part of the world.",1339891200,,768,4.572463768115942
