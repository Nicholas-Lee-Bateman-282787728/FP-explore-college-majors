I thought I was getting the Complete Series that is all of the seasons in one boxset.
I know it's my fault for not bothering to read that one silly number 1 and there is only 5 discs plus to put 2 and 2 together o sorry funny play on words there but right ok.
I now know that complete series with a number in front of it does not mean the whole series but that it's a season what ever number boxset!

Good to know that now would have been nice to know before buying this but the item description is very misleading
to some of us that just see something and think o they would not try to cheat me.

But this is amazon and even though amazon is a little better than ebay it's not all that much better there r still people that will use a play on words to mislead u here to.
So do ur homework on what ur getting before u buy I really wish I did. -_-,

I guess I would have known this is not what it sounded like if they had mentioned that there where only 20 episodes!
Ja that would have given away that this is not what it sounds like but o well anything to make money is ok I guess for some people!

I'm not saying that Bleach is a bad anime in fact I really like this series just it's a pain trying to get every season ever made so far lol.",1353283200,12,1525,4.3780918727915195
