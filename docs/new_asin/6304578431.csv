7874456,5,6304578431,I RECEIVED THE DVD IN VERY GOOD CONDITION AND IT PLAYS VERY WELL.,1466121600,,65,4.076923076923077
7874457,4,6304578431,"In the breadth of almost three decades of Gary Daniels' filmography, it's not surprising that something like ""Hawk's Vengeance"" gets overlooked often, even though it should stand out. This is a fairly unique outplay of Daniels' typical formula, offering some unexpected twists and plenty of entertainment. It's not the best work he's done and just narrowly edges a four-star rating, but fans should certainly check this one out.

The story: A Marine (Daniels,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Recoil/dp/B000G1R31W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Recoil</a>) investigates the murder of his stepbrother and discovers a fiendish organ-smuggling operation.

The plot is formulaic but still fun. It's an antihero picture, with Gary showing a fairly sadistic side when handling helpless opponents, but it's also a buddy flick with George Chiang (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tracker/dp/B00005O5D2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tracker</a>) bringing some humor out of Daniels. One of the major plot points includes the deeds of a skinhead gang, so there are some mildly uncomfortable racial tactics going on. There are a few inspired moments of creativity, such as when Gary's character poses as a fire inspector to infiltrate the skinhead hangout, or when Chiang and he instigate a shootout between the gang and some gangsters by posing as Hasidic Jews. Later, Gary creates a homemade rocket launcher. My favorite feature, though, is the relationship between the two main hitmen, played by Vlasta Vrana (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Upside-Down/dp/B00C2PO09I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Upside Down</a>) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlie-Biddle/dp/B00005A1BU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlie Biddle</a>: why these two guys are given this amount of exposure is a mystery to me, but indulging their characters helps round the film.

The fight content may be the most unique aspect of the entire film, at least where Gary's norm is concerned. Weapons maestro Cass Magda plays the lead villain and acts as fight choreographer, doing well in both jobs and adding a distinctive flavor to the adrenaline highlights. I can't call the 11 fight scenes realistic, but they're definitely more so than many a brawl Daniels has done. His character has plenty of cool kicks but is far from invincible, and the fights show the genuine hazards of fighting multiple opponents at once (even less skilled ones). Cass has two scenes wherein he spars with training partners and demonstrates mastery of swords and sticks that would impress Jet Li and Sammo Hung. The eventual showdown between Magda and Daniels is simultaneously disappointing and great: Cass clearly needs to slow down so as to not dice the British Danger Man, but the back & forth pace and inclusion of many improvised weapons makes this one distinctive. I wish Magda had done more movies...

I can easily recommend this one to a wide audience of low-budget action lovers. The most discerning fans of Gary Daniels may turn away from it for being a bit of a departure from the norm, but both completionists and inclusive devotees will likely have a lot of fun with this one. Check it out!",1426550400,,3304,5.920335429769392
7874458,5,6304578431,One of Daniel's best movies. This movie has great martial art fights and great gun fu. I never heard of the guy playing the evil boss. but he is a pretty damn good martial artist.,1355011200,,179,4.142857142857143
7874459,4,6304578431,"This is a good film for the first couple of times but then seems a bit boring but I just watch it for the fight scenes. This story is about British Royal Marine Eric 'Hawk' Kelly (Gary Daniels) who is out to get answers and draw blood when he arrives in New York to investigate his step brothers brutal murder. With the help of streetwise detective Lizzie Hampton, Hawk uncovers the most lucrative of black market plots - the theft and sale of human organs! Hawk meets exotic blade and stickfighting artist Garr (Cass Magda) who is the one responsible for his brother's death.",1131408000,2,576,4.548076923076923
7874460,3,6304578431,"If I could see Gary Daniels kick butt for two hours strait I would have that tape playing in my house 24\7. Unfortunately some of his movies have  been cursed not only with a plot, but with a really bad one. The acting is  fine but when a nine-year-old writes a script there is only so much good  acting can do. The fights are great. If this movie had a better editor or a  director who knew the advantages of changing angles or say a writer who  graduated high school this could be a 5 star movie easily. Daniels is the  best!",968025600,2,527,4.117647058823529
