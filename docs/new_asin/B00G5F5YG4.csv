8620886,5,B00G5F5YG4,"The perfect workout for when I need to get a great cardio workout in a short amount of time. The HIIT bursts are 30 seconds on, 30 off, but often I'll continue the exercise for 40 seconds and take 20 seconds of recovery instead of the full 30. The workout is short, sweet, and gets the job done. It does require a high step, but you could modify the workout if you don't have one and still get your heart rate up.",1513123200,,413,4.048780487804878

8620888,5,B00G5F5YG4,"Perfect hiit workout to compliment my weight training routines. Just the right length and using in my humble opinion some of the best exercises to target those trouble areas(jump squats, jumping lunges, and power ups are great for the legs and butt !!) You've really nailed it with this one Toby. It's superb !!! Exactly what i was looking for !!",1383350400,,346,4.688524590163935

In the warm up he does a few jumping jacks and uses the step. What was a little fast paced for me was the step part,stepping up on it then you step off to the sides then back up on the step then you step off the back then back to jumping jacks then stepping up on the step again alternating your feet etc...I'm not taking off 1 star JUST for the warm up, because, when you get through the warm up the rest of the workout is fine. You have 21 different moves you do each move for 30 seconds then you get a 30 second rest and while your resting Toby explains the next move that's coming up. You do not repeat any of the moves. This workout is based on HIIT workouts. For me there is no dread factor. If your looking for a good little cardio workout,I think this one is it. This will be in my rotation. I'm not gonna let a little fast paced warm up stop me from using it. I don't have the kinda step that they are using,I have the old firm fanny lifter step and it works fine. It kept my heart rate up and I was sweating. I LOVE IT!!!!! Including the warm up and cool down it's around 30 minutes. There are no chapters and no premixes. Just a 30 minute workout,no extras. The menu is as follows:Introduction,Play workout,Music on/off. That's it.",1382832000,2,1369,4.074074074074074
