6305179,4,B00IY7GMZI,"I don't understand or agree with the negativity of some of the reviews here.  Gold is a German/Canadian co-production.  It's situated in western North America, where I grew up, live, and have traveled on vacations.  My film viewing count on foreign (non-U.S.) movies, going back to 1968, is over a thousand, and Gold would be situated in the best third of German movies I've seen or alternatively the best third of Canadian movies I've seen.  With its storyline of a fictional late 19th century overland journey to the Yukon Territory, it can be compared to two similar recent fictional films tracing a 19th century journey over an an ill-advised Oregon Trail alternative route, and tracing a 19th century prairie journey from western Nebraska to Iowa.  Which is to say, Gold is as good and as realistic in my opinion as Meek's Cutoff (United States, 2010), and is better and more realistic than The Homesman (United States, 2014) which offers a strong performance by Hilary Swank but otherwise suffers from geographical, agricultural, and climatological incongruities that made me roll my Great Plains-childhood eyes.  Also, Gold showcases German actress Nina Hoss who starred previously in Barbara (Germany, 2010) and before that A Woman in Berlin (Germany, 2008).",1418428800,6,1266,5.151219512195122

6305181,1,B00IY7GMZI,"This movie shows people crossing the plains in direction to the Klondike to find gold. Well the people were always with clean clothes and in perfect clean state, in the middle of nowhere suddenly they are riding in a road, there is no more than 5 words dialogs between the characters . This movie is so bad that if it is play in a passengers fly it will land empty because all the passengers will rather open the door and jump then  suffer watching it.",1413676800,2,452,4.317647058823529
6305182,3,B00IY7GMZI,"I watched this tepid adventure film because Nina Hoss('Woman in Berlin"") starred in it.  It offers some good scenery and actors but not much more except a weak plot.

Nina Hoss joins a group of German prospectors heading north through Canada to the Klondike gold fields.  They've invested into this journey with hopes of making it big.  Along the way, mishaps and tragedy happen, as the group shrinks in size, and baddies chase after them.

Ms. Hoss is her usual espressively solemn and stoic self; however, the whole movie's that way, not a lot of words wasted here, and the characters never take hold or capture much empathy. The action and shootout finale are flat and not imaginative whatsoever.  I guess they wanted to make it more realistic.  I don't know.

There is no bonus material.  You can chose English, German or German with English subtitles(which I prefered).  The final words spoken are in English and are totally matter of fact.  That pretty much sums up the movie.  2 1/2 stars, give it 3 for Nina Hoss.",1409616000,4,1021,4.706214689265536

THE STORY(NO SPOILERS): Emily Meyer (Nina Hoss) is a German immigrant to Chicago who gathers with other German immigrants in Ashcroft British Columbia, forming a pack train headed for the Klondike Gold Rush in 1898. Each person has their own short backstory for their need to find gold and better their circumstances. Emily is a former maid and divorcee who has nothing left for her in the States. Not long after the trek begins, it's clear that the trail leader has little idea what he is doing and he attempts to abandon the group in the wilderness, stealing their money. A struggle of attrition against various dangers continues as the group moves on, trying to find their way without their guide. Along the way, Emily befriends the quiet and reclusive pack master Carl Bohmer. However, two mysterious men are introduced early on that are seeking Carl with apparent evil intent. This pursuit remains primarily in the back of the viewer's mind as the two men are not seen again until things come to a head.

This is a very slow burn movie with mostly the daily tasks and travails of the band as they make their trek. Even though those travails are deadly at times, there is very little fanfare or drama and life matter-of-factly drives on. Character development was surprisingly thin for a foreign movie, particularly one that moves this slow.  Often the point of moving slow is taking time for character development (something that I like). This is not the kind of Western that US audiences will be used to. That said, I am a big fan of foreign cinema and I don't mind subtitles at all. However, this movie still just couldn't find anything to win me over. The countryside was ok, but cinematography not that inspiring as it failed to take full advantage of the landscape they traverse.  I am sure this movie was shot on a paper thin budget and for that I am sure they did a pretty good job. If I were feeling more generous or forgiving, I could still give the movie three stars. However, most people attracted to the title or dvd cover will likely not enjoy this movie. Not even as a rental. The sparse English speaking characters were not that well acted. I have to presume that outside Nina, some of the German acting was not that great either. None of it was horrible though. For atmosphere, there was some electric guitar reverberation or strumming in the soundtrack that I found completely out of character with the Western theme. Frankly, it was a little irritating. There just wasn't that much to make the movie stand out in a positive way. For those looking specifically for action, there was a very small amount of gun play at the end. Fairly unceremonious and done. I guess you could call it realistic.",1400803200,4,2764,4.681069958847736
8646329,5,B00IY7GMZI,Loved the move ....  although my version needed closed captions because it's not my language and English translation was not available.  Suspense and intrigue without all the gratuitous sex and foul mouthed hollywood normals.  Great scenery ... great acting and had you wondering where all this was going to lead.,1529625600,,313,5.22
8646330,4,B00IY7GMZI,"RELEASED IN 2013 and written & directed by Thomas Arslan, ""Gold covers events in 1898 when a single woman (Nina Hoss) joins a small group of other prospectors heading north through Canada to the Klondike gold fields near Dawson City. Their numbers dwindle as they face challenging hardships.

My title blurb says it all. Just as Meeks Cutoff (2010) covered the adversities of traveling in the late 1800s on an alternative route of the Oregon Trail and The Homesman (2014) covered journeying from western Nebraska to Iowa, so Gold features the challenges of traveling from Ashcroft, BC, where the train tracks end, to Dawson City in the Yukon territories.

Needless to say, Gold favors gritty realism to conventional Western staples. Still, there are Indians, Old West boom towns, covered wagons, a possible hanging, alcohol and a believable shootout. I think its a little more compelling than those other two flicks, although those are worthwhile too if you favor mundane accounts of arduous travel in the Old West. If youd like to see a more eventful old-fashioned Western covering similar terrain, check out The Far Country (1954) with Jimmy Stewart.

I suppose the movie should've contained at least one rain sequence, particularly considering it takes place in the Great Northwest. But shooting in the rain is challenging & costly so the viewer is asked to read in-between-the-lines that they experienced rainy days. The film never shows any of the characters 'going to the bathroom' either, but we're to assume it happened.

A German/Canadian production, THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 41 minutes and was shot in British Columbia, Canada. At least half the dialogue is in German with English subtitles.

8646331,5,B00IY7GMZI,"I wasn't expecting much. Especially when the dialogue is dubbed into English. But the longer I watched I realized this film is something special. The breathtakingly spectacular scenery is
worth the price of the dvd alone. The atmospheric soundtrack enhances the visuals. The authenticity and realism you expect from a Western are here. Notice the costuming, shacks and villages. The characters wear down and wear away inside and out.  This European filmmaker produced  one of the best Westerns and one of the most unique films you'll ever see.

8646332,2,B00IY7GMZI,"German made film with English subtitles. The film maker only got a few things right about the trek to the gold fields overland. The passage was supposed to cover many months but in this film it was perpetual fall with leaves turning color and bright sunshine every day. It never was windy, rainy or snowy throughout the whole long trail. Sometimes they only had tiny saddlebags on their horses but seemed to have a tent, cooking utensils, food and protective clothing with no visibly adequate means of carrying it. The members of the party barely spoke to each other and then only with terse and truncated phrases. I could go on and on. Some of the scenery is pretty but if you have any knowledge of the overland trek to the Yukon gold fields in 1989, this is agonizing. If you don't have this knowledge and watch anyway, please know that this is NOT AN ACCURATE PORTRAYAL.",1492300800,,873,4.56687898089172

across beautiful but unforgiving country.  It is a social and psychological journey where you can feel each persons sense of isolation and personal struggle. The need to adapt and dig deep into onesself to find the strength to keep going in grim determination is rarely so finely created in film.

8646336,4,B00IY7GMZI,"Spoiler Ahead, Maybe? I'm a BIG Western fan but nowadays it seems that most indy Westerns are cheaply done & BORING so I really wasn't expecting that much out of this movie. Gold really surprised me. It was very well done & had my attention from the start. One scene right after the other, something was always going on, the scenery was just beautiful & it was NEVER boring. If you watch alot of Westerns or ever played the game, The Oregon Trail then you can figure out what happens (I DON'T mean that in a bad way) I was hoping that everything would end up happily ever after but I knew better. If you're a fan of Westerns or not, Gold is a movie I'd recommend anybody watch. If I ever come across this movie at the store or wherever, I'm definitely buying myself a copy. It's WAY underrated & should be more well known than it is",1466294400,,832,4.238993710691824
