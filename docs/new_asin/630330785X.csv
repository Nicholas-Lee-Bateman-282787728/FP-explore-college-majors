7843901,5,630330785X,"Reese Witherspoon plays a young teenager in the early 60's south. She meets Cord, an older teen who is helping his mother farm her land that she has recently inherited. Reese is crazy about Cord, but when her older sister meets him, the chemistry between the sister and Cord is immediate and intense. The jealously Reese feels threatens the wonderful relationship she has with her older sister, and the two girls face some problems together.
