1648822,5,B00005QJJL,The description said this film was a parody. Totally inaccurate. This is a great biker flick from the 70s that has a good storyline and doesn't try to make all the Club members into villains.,1468800000,,191,4.485714285714286

1648826,1,B00005QJJL,"There are some faces you will recognize, but the parts they played in this movie were obviously one of their first. At least the movie didn't have a bunch of dirt bikes dressed like Harleys. Definitely one of the grade B movies that showed the bad bikers from the 60's, but it brought out a few chuckles and had some nice custom bikes.",1453075200,,335,4.333333333333333

1648832,1,B00005QJJL,"This has got to be one of nthe worst movies ever made. The acting, or lack thereof, was poor, the lines canned and cinematography cheap.

1648843,2,B00005QJJL,The movie was so dark it was painful to watch. Must have been a bad camera at the set.,1406505600,,86,3.5789473684210527

1648845,1,B00005QJJL,Awful!  Poorly written and acted.  I was looking for a good biker movie and I should have kept looking.  Total waste of my time!,1404000000,,128,4.25
1648846,2,B00005QJJL,Very stupid and also boring i can't believe the kind of crap we were entertained with in the early 70's,1401148800,,103,4.2

1648848,2,B00005QJJL,SOA this is Not!  Very poorly done and much of the film is too dark to see anything.  It's boring and not worth your time.,1397433600,,122,3.84

1648850,2,B00005QJJL,Want to be bikers as if they knew what it was back then. Same old crap regarding stereotyping bikers to be smelly dirty and all bad. So far from the truth.,1391990400,,155,4.032258064516129

1648852,2,B00005QJJL,"This movie gives one a taste of the 1960's genre of the outlaw biker film.  Back then watching long sequences of motorcyles racing around was considered entertaining.  One gets a modest taste of the 60's zeitgeist.

For students/fans of the genre only.",1380240000,,252,4.9523809523809526
1648853,1,B00005QJJL,"The whole thing is poorly done. Concept, writing, directing, acting, production, lighting and filming could have been done better by a high school film club.

If you make time to watch this turkey I predict you'll come away saying, ""What a waste of time"".",1370390400,,255,4.795454545454546

1648855,3,B00005QJJL,"The drug dealing Angels are invited by the Dragons to party with them at a ghost town hippie commune lead by the meek Gary Busey. They have fun and games until a girl turns up dead. The Dragons, lead by a pysocotic Charlie Manson look-alike (Charles Dierkop) hold a kangaroo court and convict all the angels.

Standard drug use, bike races, girls dancing topless, fist fights, torture that defined the era. Poor video transfer to DVD. Sound Track of the era, combination rock and whack-a-da music. The over billed Busey looks like a pretty boy.

Parental Guidance: F-bomb, Nudity.",1363737600,6,580,4.848484848484849
1648856,5,B00005QJJL,"classic 60""s biker movie ,being a biker as i am i enjoyed seeing all the rights and wrong in this movie .but most of all i really like the bikes",1361836800,,144,3.8333333333333335
1648857,4,B00005QJJL,"Not the best quality, but if its the kinda movie you are into it is decent enough.  No glitches, good sync, just old technology.  Dont be afraid to purchase.  I recommend it.",1355788800,,174,4.375
1648858,5,B00005QJJL,"Near perfect biker movie though alot of scenes are dark.  Not a problem though, it adds to the stark realism.  Choppers galore, some of the best chopper footage I've seen in a movie.  The dirty underside of lawlessness rears its head with rape, torture, deal burns, killing, deceptions, insanity.  Killer music track.  Excellent choice of actors, Gary Busy plays a lesser but viable role.  Charles Dierkop plays the demented leader of the Dragons biker gang.  Larry Bishop isn't portrayed as smooth as in Angel Unchained or Hellride, but still good.  The real treat is the lead Angel- Long John(Scott Glenn)and his role in story.  One you can watch over and over.  Probably the best biker movie out there.  It's the High Plains Drifter of Biker Movies.  Worth every penny.  The movie was made on $180k and made $2 mil at the box office.",1355356800,8,836,4.7622377622377625
1648859,5,B00005QJJL,This is a great biker movie you should add to your collection. It's fun to watch great actors before they made it big!,1355097600,,118,4.173913043478261

1648861,5,B00005QJJL,"I own many biker movies that were made throughout the last 45 years or so, and several that were made during the 60's and into the 70,s. However, there always seems to be something that I don't like about the movie, whether it be the acting, the story line and even the soundtrack for the background score in many of the scenes. ""Angels; Hard As They Come"" doesn't seem to have anything that bugs me; Scott Glenn nails down his role perfectly, and the supporting cast which includes a young Gary Busey does very well and really sells the story. The music is minimal, yet is actually from a band at the time and not just annoying grindhouse guitar. One of the elements that also comes across well is that they show some really cool bikes; mainly in the first half of the movie, though. However, the second half has some entertaining violence and nudity which definitely holds your interest. This movie was definitely worth the money I spent on it!",1349568000,2,946,4.538011695906433
1648862,2,B00005QJJL,"I enjoy exploitation and biker flicks and ""bad"" cinema but this one just didn't do it for me, I just found this whole mess really annoying, the acting and dialog are terrible, as is the storyline and nonstop background score, I really can't think of anything redeeming this film has to offer except it has some decent actors in early bit parts, but unless you are a die hard biker film fanatic I doubt anyone will enjoy this, it would never have been released on dvd had it not happened to have a few mins of Gary Busey in it.",1316822400,3,526,4.27
1648863,4,B00005QJJL,"I liked this one.  Though it has a low price tag, it has a lot of action - fighting, drinking, partying, topless chicks, bike races, and even hippies. I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't a bigger vengeful ass-kicking at the end by the Angels.  Yeh, there were a couple bikers wasted, but it was done too quickly.  For the price - buy this!  I've seen far worse at a higher price.",1299110400,,386,4.2465753424657535
1648864,5,B00005QJJL,i got this for agift for my boyfriend. he loves the movie because it has alot of action in it.,1297900800,,94,3.75
1648865,2,B00005QJJL,"I guess ""Angels Hard As They Come"" could've had some potential but it just never delivers.  I've read this movie's supposed to be ""hippies vs. bikers"" but it's really ""bikers vs. bikers with hippies in the middle"".  However exciting this may sound, it plays out awkwardly and even boobs, drugs, and violence can't save it.  Maybe it's the script was weak, or the characters were never really developed, but the main flaw is simply a technical one; most of this film is underexposed.  It's simply too dark to see what's going on.
Scott Glenn's fans probably expect some hypermacho stuff, but he mostly mumbles and seems oddly passive.  This must've been an early role for him.

 A lot of films in the biker genre were hastily put together and turned out rather dull, and this is one of them.  It ain't no ""Devil's Angels""!",1280016000,,821,4.652777777777778
1648866,1,B00005QJJL,"Like another viewer I was suckered into buying this really bad flick because of Gary Busey.  His appearance comes out of nowhere toward the end and makes no sense at all, as if it were an afterthought.  The cover photo of him is NOT from this film and he does NOT play a biker!  This garbage has NO redeeming quality whatever.  Echo Bridge Entertainment is on my ""S"" list!",1268784000,3,372,4.3478260869565215
1648867,4,B00005QJJL,"Quick synopsis - The Angels have a drug deal is set up but gets foiled when the cops show up. A hasty agreement is made to complete the deal a few days later in the desert and complete the deal.

The Angels head for the meeting place. On the way they meet up with the Dragons and are invited to come party in an old ghost town named ""Lost Cause"" with the Dragons and some hippies living there.

The Dragons leader ""The General"" is somewhat psychotic; his henchman Axe isn't all to stable either.

Trouble starts when one of the hippie girls is murdered and the Dragons decide that one of the Angels did it.

Fans of 1960/70s exploitation movies will flip over this one! It's an over- the-top drive-in biker movie that glows with raw, primitive energy, rustic location shooting and a rambling storyline.

I've seen or own most of the biker films from 1965-1973 (the original era), and this one is near the top.",1259712000,3,909,4.451807228915663
1648868,1,B00005QJJL,"I'm a fan of Gary Busey and I know this was one of his first movies and I know this was originally a B-movie, but his scenes were few and far between and without substance. This was even a poor B-movie. I tried my hardest to find some positive quality about this movie, but could not do it. The picture quality was poor, the acting was poor, the script was poor. I gave it one star, just because some of the bikes were sharp looking. I'd recommend many other biker movies over this one. Don't waste your time.",1202947200,10,509,4.204081632653061
1648869,1,B00005QJJL,"This product had no voice volume at all, had it turned up all the way and was nothing.
SAVE YOUR MONEY AND YOUR TIME on this one.",1192492800,5,129,3.814814814814815
1648870,3,B00005QJJL,"This Biker flick actually has a plot, and the costumery is very good. The actors look and act like Bikers and the emphesis was placed on the Biker and their lifestyle, rather than the hippie culture. There is plenty of Bikes, Booze, and Babes!",1165708800,2,243,4.545454545454546

7950785,3,B00005QJJL,"It wasn't a satire to me. It looked like a hippie vs. biker trash movie and the trio of drifter bikers trying to help. it would have been better without the nudity. Drugs,violence and nudity. It was probably Scott Glenn's and Gary Busey's first movie or close to it.",1470182400,,266,4.448979591836735
