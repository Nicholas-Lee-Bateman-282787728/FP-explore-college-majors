5767082,5,B00D1QX87W,"We love the Nickelodeon Peter Rabbit DVD, only wish it was longer and had more episodes! We want the Christmas Peter Rabbit dvd as well, sure hope they put out more of these...",1395273600,,176,4.363636363636363
5767083,5,B00D1QX87W,"I used to love Peter Rabbit as a kid and now I get to share that experience with my own kids.  This DVD features about 1.5 hours of Peter Rabbit, which is actually a lot of Peter Rabbit and friends!  There are eight episodes that take you through Beatrix Potter's forrest.  While they are all episodes that have previously aired on television, I like having them all on one DVD so I can let my kids watch one or a few at a time, whenever we want!  Whether you have a Peter Rabbit fan or someone who has never seen the show, this is a cute DVD to own and enjoy.  Peter and his friends go on adventures throughout the forrest and yes there are bad guys, but they are not scary.

Episodes include:

The Tale of the Radish Robber
The Tale of the Two Enemies
The Tale of the Greedy Fox
The Tale of the Secret Treehouse
The Tale of Benjamin's Strawberry Raid
The Tale of the Lying Fox
The Tale of the Angry Cat
The Tale of Mr. Tod's Trap",1392422400,32,931,4.082417582417582
5767084,5,B00D1QX87W,"Although was familiar with the story of Peter Rabbit never really read the books on the characters but compared to other animated versions I've seen of the character this is by far my favorite. Peter is still the trouble maker I always heard about but the lessons given in the series is done light heart and entertaining instead of preachy. The CGI animation is fantastic. Since there really aren't all that many episodes made of the series shame however they didn't just do a season set instead of this which I already picked up when it was a Only at Wal mart exclusive,  and the Christmas DVD release which I wish I had picked up having learn it had more than just that Christmas pilot on it.",1387497600,,694,4.464566929133858
