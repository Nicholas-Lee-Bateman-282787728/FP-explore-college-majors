8459787,5,B0056N4SC2,My son loves trains and this is now one of his favorite DVDs. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it contains 3 DVDs for the price. There was a Christmas DVD about trains and a DVD on jet planes. He loves them all but the train engineer DVD is a real favorite and very informative for any adult who ends up watching it with their kids.,1388793600,,339,4.074626865671642
