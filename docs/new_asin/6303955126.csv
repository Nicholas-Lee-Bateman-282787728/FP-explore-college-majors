742248,1,6303955126,The first Oblivion was a funny culty movie.  This was not.  There aren't really any redeeming qualities here.  It took up the first six minutes with a summary of the movie.  Everything after that was just a waste of film.,1360540800,,221,4.45
742249,3,6303955126,"Not as good as the first, but good for B-movie fans. The acting is overdone, the effects are frugaly done. A B-movie start to finish.",1223942400,4,133,4.36
742250,3,6303955126,"The first downfall is no subtitles or closed captioning.  But if you are a fan of low budget campy quirky fun, then backlash is for you.  Seeing Julie Newmar and Meg Foster alone is worth the price of the movie.",1140652800,11,211,4.25
742251,3,6303955126,"The two Oblivion movies are some of the best, and least known, of the Full Moon films.
This film takes place immediatly after the first. (I think they were filmed at the same time.) The main plot concerns an intergalactic bounty hunter after a sabatour wanted by the galaxicorp.  The main suspect is Lash. (Played by the incredible Musetta Vander.) Zack, as sheriff, must help the bounty hunter in his quest.
The film lacks the in-jokes that made the first so fun. Julie Newmar has much more of a role in this one.  (I am not certain what to think about her in this. Something about a 60+ year old woman in a form fitting outfit that is kind of frightening.  Especially since she still looks good, in a weird plastic surgery Brazil-like way.)
If you liked the first, get this. If you have not seen the first movie, get that as well.",1030147200,13,832,4.42483660130719
742252,4,6303955126,"To really enjoy this film to its full extent, you need to see part one.  (Called ""Oblivion"".) Part one is a better film, but this is still quite enjoyable.
This series is one of the more enjoyable efforts from Full Moon entertainment.  Mostly they are known for horror films. This is a science fiction western.
The film takes place on a far off world in the far future.  (Imagine a western town with bank machines and aliens.)
The film starts off right after the end of the previous one. Ine galaxicorp has sent a bounty hunter to track down a ruthless sabiteur of galaxicorp property.  The bounty hunter is a dandy in top hat tails.  He is much more deadly than he looks.  He is after Lash, a black-haired villeness who dresses in S&M (Stand and Model) outfits and carries an electrified whip. I won't spoil who the real culprit is.
This film has some rather interesting characters including George ""Mr. Sulu"" Takai as ""Doc"", Julie ""Catwoman"" Newmar as ""Miss Kitty"", and a couple of other familiar faces. (The first film has a whole bunch of Star Trek related jokes with George Takai that are quite funny.)
If you enjoy science fiction comedies, then get this film and track down the first one as well. You won't regret it.
Full Moon needs to reissue both on DVD, as well as put out a Lash action figure.",985392000,4,1305,4.508474576271187

742324,5,6303955126,"Bought to replace a VHS tape.  Full Moon has mostly come through for me with B-movie fantasy and science fiction.

The heroes of Oblivion are back and joined by Michael Caulfield (from Grease 2) as a bounty hunter, and Red Eye's brother looking for revenge.

Also stars the ever beautiful Musetta Vander (as Lash), taking center stage as the target for Caulfield's bounty hunter.

Lots of fun for the whole family.",1454198400,,414,4.788732394366197
742325,3,6303955126,It is a cheesy western Scifi movie spoofing other movies. I liked it.,1446422400,,69,4.384615384615385
742326,4,6303955126,"Pretty good flick.  The original Oblivion was slightly better, but this is a fun film with some inside jokes.  George Takei doing the Vulcan sign, for example.  Ms Kitty being played by former Catwoman on the tv version of the batman series.  If you liked Oblivion you'll probably like this.  The adventures of Brisco County Jr are somewhat in the same vein if you like this sort of stuff.  Although they are a little bit more silly than this movie.",1441152000,,449,4.55

Red Eye's twin brother shows up to join forces, but ""Lone Ranger"" Zack and ""Tonto"" Buteo, along with the ol' gang set out to hilariously attempt at bringing them in.
If you're not up for campy humor and total b-movie quality, this may not be your gig. But I love lots of movies, Horror and B-movies especially. Another entertaining installment.",1432252800,,492,4.8

742423,5,6303955126,"A fairly decent sequel to Oblivion, a space western.  I bought it to complete the set and because it features Julie Newmar and Meg Foster, two of my favorite actresses.  The plot involves a bounty hunter (Maxwell Caulfield as Sweeney) who shows up on Oblivion to arrest someone he doesn't know, hasn't seen, who has multiple aliases and has changed her appearance several times.  That description could fit almost anyone but since it mostly fits the resident outlaw Lash (Musetta Vander), he's more than happy to take her back with him and the town is more than willing to let him have her.  Unfortunately, she does not plan on going quietly.  She claims she's innocent of all charges, mostly because she doesn't understand half of them.  In the meantime, it's business as usual.  The town is loaded with its own brand of colorful characters, including George Takei as Doc Valentine, Carel Struycken as Gaunt the town undertaker, and Isaac Hayes as Buster.  The sheriff is a little dim but he means well (Richard Joseph Paul as Zack Stone).  And it's a good thing the cold-blooded bounty hunter likes him.  ""You're straight forward.  I like a man after my own heart.  Well, actually, not always.  Once there was a man after my own heart and I had to strangle him with his own intestines.""
It's bizarre and fun.",1427846400,,1310,4.71806167400881

742429,4,6303955126,"This is the sequel to Oblivion - no not the new movie staring Tom Cruise (which was excellent).  Many of the same characters are back to reprise their rolls from the first movie: Andrew Divoff, Julie Newmar, George Takei and Musetta Vander.
If your looking for a solid sci-fi movie this is not it.  This is a campy comedy that had me laughing all the way through.  George takei as Dr. Valentine is so over the top you want to cringe,  But Musetta Vander as Lash is the star eye candy, and the real reason to watch the movie!",1377561600,,524,4.262626262626263

Musetta Lander is at her sexy, raucous best using an electrified whip as her weapon.
