4934091,5,B0062Z0PHU,"This is volume 3 in the Warner Archive series of Tim Holt ""B"" Westerns, and these ten entries in superb prints all come from 1949 until 1952. Another reviewer has very usefully listed the particular film titles in this collection. As usual, RKO produced the Holt series with particular care: production values are exceptionally high; photography is superb; Paul Sawtell's musical scores are excellent and seem to mirror plots so nicely; story-lines are solid and compact; casting is very good, with a number of fine familiar character actors (e.g., Lane Bradford, Harry Harvey, Douglas Fowley and many others)filling lesser roles (and Dorothy Malone making an early appearance in ""Saddle Legion""!). His side-kick in these outings is Richard ""Chito"" Martin who adds humor to each film, as well as a bit of romance.

Tim Holt could act, as anyone familiar with his roles in ""My Darling Clementine"" and ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" can attest. It is perhaps unfortunate that he was unable to graduate to larger ""A"" level Westerns, like Randolph Scott, John Wayne, or Wild Bill Elliott. Nevertheless, these films are superior examples of the genre in every respect.

Watching these films, sixty years after they were released, rekindles and recalls for us a certain joy that many of us had as young boys and girls. Perhaps it is a bit of nostalgia, but interestingly, in re-viewing these Holt Westerns--and after watching dozens of more contemporary movies---I think they stand up pretty well all round. Perhaps a new generation of viewers will discover them?

Now, by my count there are about eighteen more Tim Holt/RKO oaters out there (many that were shown on TNT television/satellite when it first started up). Let us hope that Warner will give us the remainder in two additional volumes--4 and 5. These films, and those remaining to be released, are the some of the best of the B-Western genre.",1331164800,,1901,5.0094936708860756
4934092,5,B0062Z0PHU,"A whole new generation, or more, now have the opportunity to see and enjoy thirty of Tim Holt's so-called ""B"" westerns, originally released by RKO Radio Pictures.  Warner Brothers has made available, from the studio's archives, 30 of his movies from the mid-1940s through 1952.  Though some sixty years old, these DVD transfers look and sound GREAT! His career has, unfortunately, too often been dismissed as second rate; but, as one who grew up watching these films, Tim Holt was a hero and a role model for myself and countless other kids.  Sadly, this man--a World War II hero--passed away at a young age.  But he left a great legacy!

4934093,5,B0062Z0PHU,"This is the third Tim Holt Western Collection containing ten movies. The quality is super sharp, even when you put a film on pause the picture stands crystal clear. The films are very good and of course great nostalgia. Tim Holt is such a convincing cowboy and he must have made all the women in the audience warm with his boyish charm. Sidekick Richard Martin is good though his role is a bit silly. And then there is the lovely ladies, wellknown heavies and lots of small parts played by the ""reliables"" of the time. Thanks for giving us these collections. I hope we can one day experience Allan Rocky Lane in same quality. No firm has yet released good copies with him.",1327795200,12,672,4.471544715447155
4934094,5,B0062Z0PHU,"RKO Radio Pictures presents ""TIM HOLT WESTERN CLASSICS VOL. THREE"" (1950/51/52) (605 min/B&W) -- Tim Holt was a popular second generation cowboy star, the son of Jack Holt (silent western star) -- When George O'Brien (RKO's top cowhand) left the studio in 1940, Tim took over his series of low-budget Westerns, gathering a strong following over in the 1940s - in each of these well budgeted entries he was ""assisted"" by comic Cliff Edwards - then came Richard ""Chito Jose Gonzalez Bustamante Rafferty"" Martin was Holt's saddle pal for the final years of Holt's B-Westerns.

I've been a big fan of the B-Western, have watched everything I could get my hands and eyes on --- Tim Holt is right at the top of my all time favorite oaters -- Feel Tim was probably one of the most under-appreciated heroes of the genre.

The Western Classics Collection includes:

1.) - STORM OVER WYOMING (1950) - (61 min/B&W) ~ Starring: Tim Holt, Richard Martin, Noreen Nash, Tom Keene
(Directed by Lesley Selander) .... Tim and his sidekick Chito, cowhands looking for work, arrive in Sundown Valley, Wyoming just in time to stop sheep ranch foreman Bill Kennedy from lynching cattleman Tom Keene.

(Directed by Stuart Gilmore) .... To aid ranchers against a crooked land agent, Tim and Chito recruit a famed El Paso marshal...who turns out to be female --- * please take note this is my least favorite Holt Western, but still watchable.*

* Please note - Screen Aspect: 4 X 3 FULL FRAME

* Special footnote: -- Picture and sound quality is very sharp and clear, about time we have these great B-Westerns on DVD -- Good supporting cast, and location cinematography is a plus -- Highly recommend for all fans of Tim Holt and B-Western fans.

*** Agree with fellow reviewer Martin Grams Jr.:
Warner Archive came out with three sets and all of them are just as gorgeous as this volume -- also Warner Brothers has been releasing these DVDs in DVD-R format -- some may think this a bootleg, that could be a problem for some of the fans and collectors.

4934095,5,B0062Z0PHU,"As a fan of cowboy Westerns, I found that Tim Holt movies were often a bit more adult than the standard juvenile fare. Surely Westerns were made for the kiddies in the 1940s, who flocked to movie palaces to watch Hopalong Cassidy and Roy Rogers. But Tim Holt Westerns were made for adults as well as children. Turner Classic Movies has aired a number of them in the past and even with Turner in High Def, the quality was so-so because the studio kept turning to the same masters year after year. My copy arrived four days ago courtesy of Warner Archive (where I prefer to buy my discs because of the warning below.)

Thankfully, this five-disc set has the same movies but transferred using today's latest technology and equipment, and are obviously from the 35mm nitrates, so the picture quality is better than what you see on Turner! Warner Archive came out with three sets and all of them are just as gorgeous as this volume.

By the way, Warner Brothers has been releasing these DVDs in DVD-R format. Regrettably, a friend of mine who bought a set and watched it wanted to resell it. After all, he didn't want to keep it, just watch the films and then put the DVD set back up on Amazon as ""used"" and at a discount. Someone bought the set and filed a complaint, stating they were bootlegs because they were DVD-R format. Amazon.com acknowledges and discloses the fact that these are DVD-R format, but when the customer complained, Amazon kicked my friend off their site and he cannot buy anything from Amazon.com any more. This is a shame and unfair to my friend because it's the very same item Amazon shipped to him. Small suggestion: If you decide to resell your Tim Holt set, consider reselling it elsewhere.",1322006400,25,1713,4.576547231270358
4934096,5,B0062Z0PHU,"I ordered this DVD because I remembered seeing Tim Holt in the late forties and early fifties. I was not disappointed. I recommend this to anyone who likes the old B-Western movies. I enjoy Tim Holt as much as Roy, Gene. Lash, and Hoppy. Looking forward to seeing Tim's other DVD's",1391212800,,281,4.529411764705882

4934098,5,B0062Z0PHU,"I agree with the twelve previous reviewers that watching these films, although they are old, is fun. There is really not much to add, so I will address just one of them: Border Treasure. This 1950 black and white film shows Tim Holt and his Mexican fumbling humorous friend catching thieves who steal jewels collected to help hundreds of Mexicans in Mexico who became homeless due to an earthquake.. As usual there is little subtlety; the bad men seem bad; there is no mistaking them. And the woman who tries almost successfully to entice Holt's buddy is clearly, to us, a bad person, although not to him. Although the film is about an hour long, there is time for the villainous woman to sing two songs. We could find fault with the film, by modern standards - such as the failure to give people who donate a receipt, or why did Holt's buddy chase after him when Holt told him to stay and protect the caravan. However, rather than taking away from the film, such things add to our fun.",1387065600,,986,4.483333333333333
