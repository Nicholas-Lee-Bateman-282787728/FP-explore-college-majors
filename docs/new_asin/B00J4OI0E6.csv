Diabetes is important and it shows what kind of friend he is to save his friend's life. Too many flashbacks, and not as suspenseful. It was mehh.",1527292800,,269,4.1923076923076925

8648159,5,B00J4OI0E6,"What an epic story based on a true event that shows how it can often take a tragedy (a diabetic reaction in this case) to bring friends back into relationship with one another.  This movie was a great mixture of drama, comedy, and thrills that will entertain the whole family; it's definitely a family friendly movie.  The legend of ""The Longest Swim"" and how it ties in at the end was done magnificently and this is truly an inspiring and must see flick!  It also creates a beautiful awareness and glimpse into the struggles people have with diabetes and managing it.  Two enthusiastic thumbs up!",1407456000,2,597,4.6571428571428575
