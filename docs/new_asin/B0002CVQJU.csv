2076566,5,B0002CVQJU,"Like the previous reviewer, I also am not LDS. But I have good LDS friends & discovered upon watching this movie (which was loaned to me by a member of the church) that I've seen enough of the culture to appreciate the movie, which is--in places--laugh out loud funny.

I was locked down in barracks in Cuba during Hurricane Ivan when I watched this, and it greatly relieved a boring and stressful day. It's just escapist, entertaining, clean fun that finds humor without being disrespectful. It is consistently funny. The arrest is absurd & far-fetched but somewhow not jolting in context.

All of the characters are good. I particularly enjoyed the protagonist, his mother, the exchange student and the protagonist's best friend.

Nothing about this is intellectually challenging but it's thoroughly entertaining to anyone who has some exposure to LDS culture. It would not appeal to people who have no familiarity.",1094860800,17,917,5.059602649006623
2076567,4,B0002CVQJU,"Before reviewing this film, I must put a disclaimer up front...I'm not LDS but spent 3 years at BYU, so I know the Mormon culture quite well, from the outsider's perspective.  The flood of LDS films in the new century is a welcome relief and quite possibly is due to the conflicts I witnessed at BYU between their editing of Hollywood movies to the annoyance of the Hollywood industry, especially the battles with ""Titanic"" (when I was at BYU) and the controversial anti-Mormon film ""Orgazmo""(which was one of the worst movies I've ever seen).

This film, ""The RM"" follows on the heels of ""The Singles Ward"" and while I thought the jokes were stretched thin in ""The Singles Ward"", I found the humor in this film more spread out and funnier overall.  This film pokes fun at the expectations that RMs have upon returning from their mission, from a big Welcome Home celebration, to reuniting with one's girlfriend, getting one's job back, and a new respect from family, friends and fellow churchmembers.  To the dismay of Jared Phelps (the returned Missionary), life seemed to have moved on for everyone else while he had been away for two years.  His attempts to readjust to life outside the mission field offer plenty of laughs, though one would most likely have to be familiar with LDS Culture to understand and appreciate.

One thing I never understood about the LDS is that even though they believe in eternal marriage, why on earth would a person not want to wait until the mission is over to marry the ""love of her life"".  The rush to marry an RM is all too real in Happy Valley.  It all works out in the end for Jared Phelps, despite a mischievious best friend who gets him in trouble with the law (which seems more a contrivance than a realistic development in order to move the film along to a climatic conclusion).

For me, the funniest scenes in the movie regards the ponzi salesmanship scheme that people are involved in.  At one company that Jared briefly works for, each time a person makes a sale, they have a hilarious cheer that is all too real for anyone familiar with some of the companies in Utah Valley and the promises of high salaries for successful salesman.  It is interesting that Returned Missionaries easily adapt to this line of work, since peddling the Book of Mormon door to door gives them the experience of salesmanship and how to deal with rejection/door slams.

After seeing this film, I hope that Halestorm will continue to make films about the Mormon experience in modern society.  Its nice to see a positive reflection of a people I've come to love represented in inexpensively made, yet high quality, good acting films.  Hopefully they will spend more time working on quality stories with more plausible plots.  The talent is definitely there and there are so many more stories worth telling.",1093305600,39,2829,4.709939148073023
2076578,5,B0002CVQJU,Such a cute movie with so many quotable moments. It came on time and was in great shape.,1468972800,,88,3.9444444444444446
2076579,4,B0002CVQJU,"Love this movie! However, the sound quality was not the best. Maybe just this recording?",1464220800,,88,4.933333333333334
2076580,4,B0002CVQJU,"The movie was very funny!  But the movie skipped 3 or 4 times, but we'll have to try it on a different DVD player to make sure it's the player and not the DVD.  Will update review when I try it on a different player",1461801600,,215,3.7555555555555555
2076581,4,B0002CVQJU,"A wonderful little film shot on the fairly cheap, with smiles, if not a lot of laughs, from the land of THAT'S NOT FUNNY!!! (where loud laughter is hushed up as a cardinal sin and old ladies patiently wait outside department store windows to witness naked mannequins and march, march, march up to the offices to complain).

Kirby Heyborne gets in his acting chops portraying the kind of inept, well-meaning innocent dope coming home after being an unpaid door-to-door salesman in Wyoming, and the mildly funny humor derived from the same kind of child-oriented comedy used by the Three Stooges in the late '50s/early '60s (Larry, Moe, and Curly Joe) movies, like HAVE ROCKET, WILL TRAVEL and GO AROUND THE WORLD IN A DAZE, adapted for Brigham's Empire, is slathered throughout the picture.  Like the 'Stooges movies, THE R.M. has a gorgeous always fully clothed G-rated actress as eye candy for the guys, Britani Bateman, vamping around as Heyborne's love interest, a delightful if utterly implausible mating of the common young Rodney Dangerfield-like returned goof with no prospects, no future, no transportation, no contacts, no education, and no chance in the (real) world landing Kelli Powers, played by an actress with a cheesecake presence very much like Jolene Blalock appearing in STAR TREK ENTERPRISE--someone so far out of his league....  But Heyborne wins her heart, giving hope to all like RM guys after homecoming.  Yes, really, he gets the girl.  Really, he gets THIS girl.  Really.  And if you believe that, I have a connection to a soaps/diet supplements/energy drinks non-FDA approved business I'm sure you'll want to invest in....

Gags:  generally great setups, but none of them really pay off.  Forgotten at the airport and takes a bus home, his parents sold his home and didn't inform him, his parents sold off his car and he only has a bicycle built for two, MLM meeting at home (notice:  everyone over age 35 in this movie weighs over 300 pounds?), his bedroom let out to a house guest, blowing a succession of dead end jobs (love the restaurant gags about the Book of Mormon food themes), his former employers pushing an LDS dating service with a mock advertisement (a howler; similar ads at the time of this writing are all over Utah TV broadcast channels at 2-4AM still), a succession of slimy 20-something LDS male friends, throwing his money away on a non-returnable (what a dope!) engagement ring and being dumped at his fiance's front door, and cluelessly getting behind the wheel of a stolen car loaded with watery beer cans (Will Swenson as a jerk is perfectly cast as Utah's Ben Affleck) calling the attention of a motorcyle cop for DUI....  Incorporated into this light comedy is a lesson about lowering young men's life expectations which undercuts the entertainment feeling of the material, however, which Mel Brooks explored in his 1991 film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-Stinks/dp/B00007GZRN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life Stinks</a>.

If you're a fan of ORGAZMO's character development (Trey Parker's character girlfriend, Lisa, perfectly captures the BYU acting school vibe), PLAN 10 FROM OUTER SPACE, and Nick Cage's homage to Provo, THE WICKER MAN, you'll get all the references this movie puts across to outsider audiences.

Young men may well take this movie as a cautionary tale and look at it as a warning about living too close to family after school.",1460419200,,3451,5.150268336314848
2076582,5,B0002CVQJU,"After seeing it in the theatre twice, I just had to purchase it.  In fact, I loved it so much that I, also,bought the sound track. Anything that Kirby Heyborne is in just has to be entertaining!",1459123200,,194,4.243243243243243
2076583,5,B0002CVQJU,"Wonderful movie! Yes, people, it's filled with absurdly exaggerated cracks at Mormonisms. That's the point! That's what makes it so funny. It's tasteful. Nothing is done to show disrespect or put down. The characters aren't SUPPOSED to behave sensibly! I mean who actually carves a RS centerpiece out of ice with a chainsaw?! C'mon! Enjoy it. It's cute. It's heart-felt. Very well done!",1455667200,,386,5.142857142857143

2076596,5,B0002CVQJU,"This is a hilarious, fun-filled movie that will entertain the entire family.  The R.M. is refreshing because it's clean AND funny.  The funniest scenes in my opinion are the Filthy Filter Lingo and the Book of Mormon Burger...but it's all great!  This movie is second only to Mobsters and Mormons, and it is definitely a MUST WATCH!",1308182400,3,332,4.7894736842105265
2076597,5,B0002CVQJU,"To appreciate all the humor in this movie, you either need to be familiar with LDS culture or watch it with someone who is. I was in this church for a while and still have friends in that church, so to me it was very funny. The writers of this movie didn't miss many stereotypes or realities of Mormon culture and still made them funny without being offensive. As a woman, the scenes of Relief Society competition among the women (although it would never be called that in the church) were especially funny, as were the juxtaposed scenes of the women's and men's meetings. The scenes of the cookies being delivered through the mail slot and the mother making an ice sculpture of the Salt Lake Temple with a chain saw had me doubled over, barely able to breathe, I was laughing so hard. Even with all the humor, there was an underlying message of perseverance and integrity throughout the movie so that anyone of any belief could understand and be touched by it. If you want to see a very funny, clean, family-friendly, well-acted movie, try this one. I don't think you will be disappointed.",1278201600,3,1090,4.566326530612245
2076608,4,B0002CVQJU,"Since I can relate to this movie in so many ways I enjoyed it thoroughly.  The performances were spot on and the depicition of family life over the top as it was, just set me off laughing even more.  Well done by all concerned.",1269561600,2,227,4.136363636363637

2076610,4,B0002CVQJU,"I myself am LDS and didn't grow up in Utah, but live there now. I found this movie funny not only because I enjoy sarcastic humor, but because many of the stereotypes, I have found, are almost too close to reality, even if stretched a little. One thing I did notice is that even if you are LDS, but have never spent time in the Utah LDS culture, then many of the jokes wouldn't make sense or seem remotely humorous. This movie wasn't meant to be intellectually stimulating, just a light entertainment. I have been disappointed with movies that have come out since ""The RM"" like ""Down and Derby"" and ""Home Teachers"" which are awful, but I find myself returning again and again to ""The RM"" for some good laughs. However, if you're looking for an LDS film that has slightly more substance, I'd recommend ""The Best Two Years"" which is excellent.",1197504000,15,841,4.5394736842105265
2076611,4,B0002CVQJU,"If you are an RM and you liked the Brat Pack movies of the 80's you may laugh qite a bit at this. If either of these don't apply to you ...You may want to pass on this. Think ""16 Candles"" type gags ( Murphy's law sqared) with the deluded deflated returned missionery for the protagonist.

I laughed quite a bit, my wife hated it, and she is the slap-stick comedy fan of the family. Funny moments, not nearly so much as ""The Home Teachers"" for way of comparison.",1179014400,2,461,4.179775280898877
2076612,1,B0002CVQJU,"""The R.M."" is quite simply, one of the most disappointing movies ever made. I didn't laugh once, and quite frankly, it was painful to sit through.

Sure I know what some people will say. It's a ""family friendly"" movie, and to criticize one is to criticize them all. Either that or, ""People who don't like movies such as this, take themselves too seriously.""

I have no problem with good natured, wholesome films. But that doesn't mean I have to like this one.

I realize ""The R.M."" wasn't meant to be taken literally, but come on, how many Mormon cliches can you stuff into an hour-and-a-half? And why couldn't at least one of the characters in this film act like a real person, instead of a one-dimensional LDS stereotype?
Someone should make of film some day about what it's really like to return home from an LDS mission. I guarantee you that even the most plain true story would be more interesting than ""The R.M.""",1168041600,4,918,4.585365853658536
2076613,3,B0002CVQJU,"There are a ton of LDS comedies out there, but this was one of the least impressive ones.  I did chuckle a few times but it seems they are running out of things to joke about.

It was okay and worth watching once (if you are into LDS satires), but it had so much lost potential.  Especially since this was made by the same people as Singles Ward.  The only thing I really enjoyed was the performance by Kirby Heyborne.

If you are looking for a LDS comedy I would suggest several others over this one.  However, if you've seen them all then there is no reason to not see this one as well.",1139184000,4,588,4.114035087719298
2076614,4,B0002CVQJU,"Like ""Singles Ward"" this is another entertaining movie. It pokes fun again about us Mormons (in a good way).This is about Jared Phelps,returning from his mission only to find out that his life before mission as he knew it,changed. Everything that could go wrong,went wrong. But being a faithful member of the church,he went through it almost unscathed and with a stronger testimony. I know it sounds simple but there REALLY is more to it than that. There are many funny moments in the film (specially the part as Jared Phelps was being dumped by his girlfriend,her family is watching,and her brother is videotaping it at the same time).Im so glad that Halestorm keeps on coming up with good,lighthearted,wholesome,funny and inoffensive movies about Mormons.

  So heres the ""But..."" part. I only have a problem when it comes to the ending. Its great that Jared became more mature spiritually but I cant help but think his problems weren't really solved. No clear resolution. Oh well...",1133049600,9,985,4.9939024390243905
2076615,4,B0002CVQJU,"If you like movies where everything that can go wrong, does - and more, and if your LDS, you should enjoy this movie. I personally don't like all the overkill comedy, but I know many do. I did enjoy many of the ""poke fun at LDS culture"" moments such as the Relief Society lesson preparation, food storage, MLM oportunities, etc.

Would I watch it again? Sure as long as I had some popcorn to keep me company.",1122249600,4,408,4.298701298701299
2076616,5,B0002CVQJU,This is a wonderfully funny movie.  If you aren't Mormon or have close friends who are you will miss a lot of the comedy.  I think it's great when a group of people can make fun of themselves.  Kept the family laughing.  From teens to grandparents.,1102032000,6,248,4.326086956521739
2076617,4,B0002CVQJU,"Like other reviewers, I'm not a Mormon, but I found this movie hilarious. For the non-Mormon, there is more than one level of humor: (1) this movie takes the classic comedy formula ""everything that can go wrong must"" to an absurd extreme, (2) the quality of writing & production is somewhat comical in itself, (3) this movie gently pokes fun at some elements of Utah Mormon culture, and (4) the non-Mormon viewer finds humor in ALL elements of Utah Mormon culture, even the ones this movie takes seriously. So whether you're a Mormon or not, if you think Mormons are funny, you will find this movie funny.

I do not recommend this movie to just any non-Mormon viewer, though. Without some knowledge of Mormon beliefs & culture (and the more the better), a lot of the humor will be lost on you, and you will probably just find the movie boring.",1101945600,8,843,4.582781456953643

8026217,4,B0002CVQJU,"Just think of this as a retelling of the Job without Larry the Cucumber.

The acting is standard fair, the jokes are pretty much Provocentric especially the family, the center-pieces and the job of selling knives door-to-door.  The lesson of overcoming temptation, greed, and the rewards for doing so is all here.

Just in case you're wondering, YES, this is  morality play.  It could be done with cowboys and horses, (Which it wasn't which is why I only gave it four stars...) it could have been done with Veggie Tales...  The point is if you like good clean fun which the whole family will enjoy and if you like movies with meanings, try this, you won't be disappointed.",1470700800,,672,4.6525423728813555
