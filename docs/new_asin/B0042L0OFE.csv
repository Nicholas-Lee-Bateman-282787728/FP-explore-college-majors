4251466,5,B0042L0OFE,"I have been waiting for a movie about the rest of us, or I should say most of us real men.  It was refreshing to get actors and a story that were at a higher level than most ""gay"" themed movies.  It was also nice to see my friends and those I love up on the screen and played with sincerity by people I've never seen.  You'll like it!",1291939200,4,334,3.8115942028985508
4251467,4,B0042L0OFE,"To many of us, the subset of the ""Gaydom"" known as ""the Bear community"" is a bit of mystery.  While the stereotypically desirable gay man is usually thought of as young, shaved/smooth and slim/athletic, it's thought to be the exact opposite in the Bear community. But it is actually a very diverse, welcoming group, and that aspect is accurately and positively portrayed in ""Bear City"" (2010).

The film focuses on Tyler (Joe Conti), a young NYC twink who is ashamed to admit to his roommate (a flaming but cute Alex DiDio) that he is only attracted to hairy bears ... to the point that he has a running fantasy of being ravished by Santa Claus!  He finally gets up the courage to go to a ""bear bar,"" where he meets some friendly, hairy men of all personalities, sizes and shapes, and decides to move into a room that one couple has to rent.  Tyler gets over his initial shyness and develops an unrequited crush on popular Roger (Gerald McCullouch, whom some may recognize from an ongoing role in ""CSI: Crime Scene Investigations"").

The screenwriter also provides mini-dramas involving a couple who are agonizing over whether/how to open up their relationship, and a fat bear who is considering weight loss surgery (even though his partner opposes it.)  There is also an ongoing theme of Roger's innate fear of a committed relationship, and the goings-on at an annual gathering known as (you guessed it) ""Bear City.""

Being somewhat familiar with that world, I felt the film presented a fairly realistic, positive look at the diversity, camaraderie and mutual support within the bear community, though I cringed a bit that it made casual ""back room"" sex seem to be an integral part of the view.  The basic story was a bit simplistic and predictable, although it was carried out admirably by its cast of mostly-new but talented actors, with a few surprise cameos I won't spoil by mentioning. Overall uplifting, very witty and enjoyable, this is a must for ""bears"" and anyone else curious about what it is all about.  Four hairy stars out of five.

Plentiful DVD extras include commentary tracks, jnterview, ""making of"" documentary, photo gallery and music video. Not rated, but would be an R for sexual content; no frontal nudity. Film won acting and screenplay awards at Los Angeles OUTFEST.",1290729600,28,2292,4.838874680306906
4251468,5,B0042L0OFE,"Just finished watching this movie, and we loved it so much.  A very sweet, loving story of a community that is rarely represented in film.  I love the warmth and acceptance in these characters of all sorts of people, not just bears, but of everyone.  It doesn't matter what you look like, you can be loved and accepted if you give people a chance to know the real youl.  That's the message from this movie.  So much fun to watch, really enjoyed all the eye candy, too.  A real honest to goodness romantic comedy!  Excellent!",1290297600,18,524,4.4526315789473685

4251470,5,B0042L0OFE,"""The Bear Movement"" is to me more a ""re-emergence"" against social pressure to shave, look civilized, and young driven by the just plain sexiness of masculine hairy men that can't be kept under control for long. Judging from how similar California bears are to Brazilian bears are to Turkish bears are to English bears, it has enormous and wide-spread gay appeal and genetic talent that many ladies seem to enjoy too.

Bear appeal is, as are most things, based on sexual taste. If you see a table full of bears in a restaurant and need to ask what a bear is, you'll never understand. Weight, masculinity, body hair, whiskers, muscle, shaved heads, flattops, etc. are all part of the list of bear features each bear and chaser puts in their own order of woofiness. Why do bears woof? Because they like to, and they also like to growl. Grouch Marx woofs wolfishly at a woman in one of his movies. Again, can't be explained. Why do bears make so many bear puns? A bear is a visual pun at its core. Human bears have a spiritual parallel to ursine bears as well.

And if you watch the trailer ([...]) with a cold heart and loins, no worries, bears just aren't your sexual taste, most entertainment is aimed at non-fans -- this is only the first feature-length fiction about bears. If BearCity touches you in one or more places, no amount of ursine puns or sexual silliness will spoil your enjoyment of it. Bears like a good laugh, drink, meal, cruise, seduction, sexytime, dance, drive, swim, nap, etc., and have given up trying to make non-fans comfortable with them.

This movie explores veins of bear and gay culture marbled with both credible and surreal situations, and old fashioned sentiments with snarky jokes, all on a non-political island of bearish hotness.

The appeal of this movie was evident as it circled the globe in LGBT film festivals, winning some awards, and sending huge roomfulls of bears into knowing smiles, giggles, and LOLs (I heard more jokes watching the DVD because laughter from theater audiences drowned a lot of them out). The charm of this movie is Langway's cobbling together of strong professional talent with very real and yummy non-professionals. Bear fans would gain plenty of pleasure even with the sound off just looking at all the bears. I call bear-watching ""The Lazy [Gay] Man's Fetish"".

The extra material on the DVD adds to your appreciation of what went into making BearCity.",1287619200,31,2417,4.758949880668258

4251472,5,B0042L0OFE,"I discovered this movie on Netflix a few nights ago, and decided to watch it. The movie is about this 21 year-old guy who's into bears (basically men who are 20 plus years older than himself), and the struggle he has of getting to finally be with the bear he's had his eyes on. I'm stoked to find out that it's a third movie in the process, but now I have to find the 2nd one online, and watch it since it isn't on Netflix.",1469318400,,423,3.988235294117647

4251477,5,B0042L0OFE,"Queer as Folk introduced us to twinks and gym bunnies. Well this time, the bears and cubs and chubs get their turn. BearCity is like Sex and the City, only bigger, thicker and ballsier. BearCity introduces us to 20-something Tyler who has a big secret: he prefers his men on the older, bigger, fuzzier side. Tyler slowly enters the world of bears, cubs and chubs and immediately befriends a tight-knit group of friends that includes couple Brett and Fred, Michael and his partner Carlos and then there is Roger. BearCity explores issues  not only in the bear community, but the gay community as a whole. Brett and Fred are attempt to keep their strained relationship from falling apart by bringing a third person into their union. Michael wants to excel in career but fears his weight is holding him back. This comes into direct conflict with his partner Carlos who believes Michael should not have to change who he is on the inside and outside. Tyler promptly falls for the gorgeous Roger who seems more preoccupied with lust (and other men) than he is with matters of the heart.

Everything is working in such sweet harmony in this film. The characters are identifiable and relatable - we all know a Roger or a Tyler or a Michael in our own circle of friends. Trust me, you do NOT have to be a gay man of a certain size and shape in order to enjoy this film. This film speaks to anyone who has ever been a friend or a lover to someone. Most importantly it shows us that we all have our problems and issues, no matter our size, our color or who we choose to love. I definitely recommend this film! Trust me you will NOT be disappointed.",1437955200,,1637,4.471571906354515

4251486,2,B0042L0OFE,"While it is great that a niche of the gay culture gets a movie devoted entirely to it, ...and uses actors representative of the scene (but probably unattractive to most), and portrays them in a positive light...(mostly!), this effort is severely hampered by both bad writing and bad acting.
(Not to mention the addition of some excessively soppy background music underscoring any scene hinting of romance!)

Sure they were always going to have to use enthusiastic amateurs in such a story, but some of the performances here are in real danger of termite infestation. (So-called ""muscle-bears"" seem particularly devoid of thespian skills, but they are by no means the only ones to so suffer!)
And when you have ""actors""(?) not of the highest calibre, given dialogue written by somebody who just cannot convincingly capture the way people actually speak, it's always going to be a bit of a disaster.

The writing is truly quite lamentable!
SO bad in fact that VERY early on in this I was tempted to bail, ....and NOT because of the subject matter, nor the inclusion of a few scenes it will probably take therapy to erase from my mind, but simply because the movie comes off as being so amateurish as to suggest a few friends got together and after smoking a bit said ""I know, ..let's make a movie!""

The most interesting performance comes from a small ""twink""...certainly NOT a bear, who flits in and out and adds a bit of life to this otherwise quite pedestrian attempt at a paean to ursine affairs.
The only other two who even approach acceptable acting standards, ...or even being ""likeable"" are the two blokes in committed monogamy who decide to ""open"" their relationship by way of an experimental threesome. This decision is allowed to descend into complete farce.

It also becomes quite puzzling as to why everybody is raving over the apparently desirable but elusive Roger, and just why the lead character, Tyler (a doe-eyed twink drop out from acting school with a penchant for bears) is doing everything to attract his attention?
Roger is SUCH an unlikeable, egotistical piece of self-obsessed, super-promiscuous driftwood, and hardly any great catch in the looks department either when it comes to that! He's barely even a bear!
The supposedly ""romantic"" ending when the two finally DO make it as a ""couple"" in the darkened urinal of a bar is hugely unbelievable, particularly Roger's sudden conversion to monogamy.
( I give it a week, ...no two days at best until somebody else ""cruises"" Roger!)

There are a couple of other sub-plots revolving around gastric lap-band surgery, ....and the issue of whether you will still be attractive as a bear if you slim down?
When you see the monumentally over-weight bloke in question, you'll no doubt also notice that he needs this done IMMEDIATELY to avoid a massive heart attack, or at the very least type 2 diabetes! His knees are already giving out under all the excess weight!
(Never mind that his partner likes him grossly obese, ...I assume he also likes him to be alive?)

Overall no surprises here really, ..but the New York Bear scene is presented in a fairly positive, if somewhat cute way, ......despite the ""back room"" sex scenarios and only minimal evidence of any condom use.
It's obviously ""cheap"", and largely ""cheerful"" I guess, and has a moment or two of humour.....but it's too fluffily ""romantic"" and poorly written, with all the loose ends being neatly tied off in a rather forced single last scene denouement to ever come close to being engrossing, rather than just gross at times.",1425427200,,3553,4.874172185430464

4251491,2,B0042L0OFE,"It's a bad movie but that has absolutely nothing to do with bears.

If you like camp and gay stereotypes you might like this movie.  The lead characters and almost all of the cast have nothing to do with the bear community at all though.  I was a bit frustrated as I understand that the movie is about a young man who supposedly likes bears and does the whole coming out thing to himself and friends but the guy he falls for is so far from being an actual bear it's not funny.  Plus not only is the writing really bad, but the acting is just as bad as well.  The writing is just  a lot of gay one liners one after another all geared towards ""bears"".  The funny thing is most real bears wouldn't be caught dead talking or behaving like that.

Sorry but I can only give this movie 2 out of 5 stars as it really just sucks.",1410566400,,820,4.049689440993789

4251507,5,B0042L0OFE,"Once upon a time, there was a handsome young man named Tyler Hall (Joe Conti). Tyler loved Bears, and he had always wanted a Bear of his very own. One evening he decided to find a Sloth of Bears and jump right into the middle of them. Maybe he could find the Bear who was just right for Tyler.  Tyler found he truly loved Bears, and made many new friends among the Bears. He found new roommates, Fred and Brent.  He met Michael and Carlos, two Bears with a deep abiding love for one another.  Tyler discovered that in the Bear scene, there is someone for everyone. However, the one perfect Bear for Tyler remained elusive.  Could his former roommate Simon help him obtain the unobtainable Bear? Will Tyler convince his Bear that Tyler is just right for him?  BearCity  is romantic and funny.

4251510,4,B0042L0OFE,"I really enjoyed this film - I have watched it a number of times. Not just for the bears, but for the story. It is quite formulaic to the rom-com standards, however the characters were charming, funny and I enjoyed the setting. There was no real storyline, I found, other than trying to pair up a twink-ish guy with a muscle bear. I thought the main problem with the film was the presence of the muscle bear as the sex symbol and the object of desire. Bear communities do not like to be labelled and defined, however for a film about bears, I would have liked to have seen the main romance between a chubby bear and a chaser. The film does follow several relationships, of which the one I outlined was involved, however it was presented as a problematic relationship where fidelity was a key issue.

The film was obviously restrained by a low budget, however it worked well with what it had. The actors were (for the main part) talented and worth watching. Comic timing was great, the dialogue I found nothing wrong with. I also enjoyed the rejection of stereotypical beauty throughout the film (though this was obviously countered by the muscle bear and the chaser getting together), especially in regards to the lapband surgery.

I think this film does wonders for the bear community, and for the gay community in general. Rather than putting two gym junkies together who can't act and are really only there for the numerous sex scenes in GLBT films, this film focuses on character, on plot, on issues such as weight, desire, fidelity, trust. Definitely worth watching. I haven't seen Bear City 2: The Proposal yet, but I expect it will be just as good.",1375401600,,1655,4.625850340136054

4251517,1,B0042L0OFE,"Where do I begin? This movie is so poorly made it is amazing. The writing is on par with a community theater production and so chock full of stereotypical gay cliches, it's insulting. The attempted comedic dialog is just not funny. The ""plot"" could have been so much better with the focus on the development of the attraction and love between the two main characters. Instead we are presented with a case study in the sick attraction of a young man exploring his bear side to a completely immature, self-gratifying narcissist. The object of his desire is extremely unlikable and you actually begin rooting for the protagonist to turn and run as far away from him as possible. What this kid sees in this ""man""  either physically or emotionally is mystifying. The romantic dilemma is eventually resolved with a very simple and obscure ""just look within"" message, then of course all is better and everyone is happy.  The two subplots are equally horrid; one to the point of ridiculous (it's me or your lapband surgery, take your pick. Really?).  Top it off with extremely poor sound, bad photography and this film honestly looked as though it was a high school project. I like bear porn as much as the next bear but some of the sex scenes in this movie were literally grotesque and completely unnecessary.  If someone could just produce something akin to a bear version of ""Beautiful Thing"" or ""Summer Storm.""  Bear City is just plain bad.",1368403200,2,1436,4.751004016064257
