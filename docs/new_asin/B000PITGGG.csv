8191813,3,B000PITGGG,"This little comedy churned out in 1941 takes place on the Pennsylvania Railroad's famous ""Broadway Limited."" The thin plot revolves around a Hollywood actess travelling with her ""adopted"" baby as a publicity stunt. The twist is that baby may or may not be kidnapped. The character performances of Patsy Kelly and Leonid Kinsky keep the whole thing bearable.

Train buffs will like the interior and exterior shots of the famed ""Broadway Limited"" and its Raymond Loewy-designed locomotives and passenger cars (and there are plenty).

The DVD recording, on the other hand, leaves plenty to be desired and the ""RE"" logo floating in the corner for the full length of the DVD is positively infuriating.

Buy it if you like the train, otherwise pass it by!",1179273600,10,749,4.976
