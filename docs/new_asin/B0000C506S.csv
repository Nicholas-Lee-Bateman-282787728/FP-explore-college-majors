7998205,5,B0000C506S,"Great DVD. I own several Zulu War dvds, but this by far the best. With these  three titles, you don't need to buy the individual films. The quality of the dvd is excellent. Absolutely clear on a 60 in tv. I strongly recommend it to all Zulu history buffs.",1495065600,,255,4.204081632653061

7998210,5,B0000C506S,With Ian Knight as one of the historians you cannot go wrong. He is the present day premier of this period in African history. You got to love the Black Spartans. ZULU,1376524800,,167,4.25
7998211,3,B0000C506S,"An overview of key elements of the history of the Zulu.  Historic recreations that look like they are taken from another source like a television history.  Some of the information gets hazy so you need more background to get it right.  The film states Louis Napoleon was killed by Zulus.  It was Louis Eugene Napoleon, son of Louis Napoleon,  who has killed.  Louis Napoleon is Napoleon III, while Eugene never became Emperor. Similar confusing statements about Shaka and his stumped male member are found in the film.  Overall, it is a good primer that can aid watching Zulu Dawn and Zulu or be a point of departure for someone wishing to learn more.",1214956800,10,651,4.707964601769912
7998212,3,B0000C506S,Excellent !  The complete story in an entertaining documentary form.  John Hurt's narration is the best.  NT,1137283200,14,108,5.235294117647059
7998213,5,B0000C506S,"If you are a fan of the Zulu and Zulu Dawn movies, this is a DVD that you should own.  Mind you, it is a documentary feature, but it is extremely well done. History buffs in general should love it.  The production values are outstanding, the narration by John Hurt is excellent, and there are commentaries by Ian Knight, surely, for we Americans, the leading expert and writer on the Zulu Wars.  The great majority of the trio of features consist of live action reproduction, brialliantly acted, and filmed on location in South Africa.  I hesitated before buying this, as I had never caught it on the Learning or History channels, there were no extant reviews, and the packaging did not initially inspire confidence.  However, my hunch paid off, and this outstanding little gem is worth every penny.",1077926400,175,799,4.760869565217392
