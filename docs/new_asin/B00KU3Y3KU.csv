6448281,5,B00KU3Y3KU,"Me and my best friend saw Summerslam live and it was a hell of a PPV!!! Matches were off the chart including Dean Ambrose vs. Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns vs. Randy Orton!!! Dolph Ziggler, Paige, and Brock Lesnar becomes the new Champions and the crowd goes nuts!! I definitely recommend this DVD to anyone who wants it!!!",1410652800,,323,4.586206896551724
6448282,5,B00KU3Y3KU,"Intercontinental Champion The Miz vs. Dolph Ziggler - Dolph started out with momentum early getting quick attempts on Miz causing him to keep going to outside to break momentum allowing him to gain some himself with a hard whip into the corner & kicks to the face as both men went back & forth having counters to the other's signatures offense throughout the match with one man showing the effects of a specific body part being worked on resulting in a great opening match.

Divas Champion A.J. Lee vs. Paige - Paige came into this match celebrating her 22nd birthday as you knew where this was going in the opening seconds where an attempted handshake resulted in the hand being bitten & hair (or weave) pulled out by the roots as the women took the fight to the outside bouncing heads off announce tables & bodies thrown into the barricade & more hair pulled out as the girls picked up the intensity with various kicks & knees to their faces, one girl being shoved off the top rope, and one impactful counter to a move that had put other divas down. Both divas put a lot into his match action & storywise with the short time they had.

Flag Match: Jack Swagger vs. Rusev - The winner of this match would have their flag raised & national anthem played after the match as Jack Swagger came out with the color guard from the Ft. Irwin military base with one man deciding to attack before the bell only for it to backfire with him heavily showing the effects of his injury throughout the contest to the point where he was having a hard time standing up only to even the odds attacking a previous injury on his opponent working over the ribs but kept hurting himself with the kicks & stomps to his opponent & even having to modify his signature move while his opponent unleashed a series of impactful moves including various suplexes. Both men really took it to each other here & told a great story here in regards to working over a body part.

Lumberjack Match: Dean Ambrose vs. Seth Rollins - Dean dominated early punishing & torturing Rollins while taking advantage of the lumberjacks on the outside tossing Seth to them more than once before Seth attempted to use the lumberjacks the same way only for Dean to react differently having no issues fighting back with the lumberjacks as both men traded momentum in the ring before the action went to the outside with both men fighting the lumberjacks to either get to or away from their opponent with the action spilling out throughout the crowd with the lumberjacks eventually having to physically carry to men back to the ring with the action just being unable to be contained between the two legal men in the match. J.B.L. pretty much said it best, ""this was the wildest most chaotic lumberjack match in history.""

Chris Jericho vs. Bray Wyatt - Jericho had defeated Rowan & Harper weeks earlier banning them from ringside as Jericho took the fight to Bray in the ring & to the outside within the first minute before Bray was able to take advantage of his surroundings on the outside to slow the pace down taking back control of the match grounding Jericho as both men went back & forth having counters to moves or being able to play mind games stopping the other man dead in his tracks while both delivering some impactful offense resulting in another good match between these two.

Bree Bella vs. Stephanie McMahon - Both women were pretty even early getting some shots & moves in on each other until Stephanie was able to gain moment with offense like the DDT & a surfboard stretch to the point where the crowd was chanting ""You Still Got It"" before Bree took control back with strikes along with a ground & pound while others decided to make their presence known at ringside. You know to never expect a wrestling clinic from a McMahon but they do know how to make a match entertaining which is what this was & actually more entertaining for Steph's first match in a decade than you get from some of the ""total"" or other long term full time divas currently.
A side note for those who didn't get the reference for why Stephanie flashed the 4 horsemen sign at ringside, female MMA fighter Rhonda Rousey was at ringside along with her female group of fighters who have named themselves the ""4 Horsewomen.""

Roman Reigns vs. Randy Orton - Reigns went after Orton right away with punches & headbutts taking the match to the outside where Orton was able to reverse the momentum in his favor slowing down the pace working him over with offense such as the garvin stomp & a superplex with both men going back & forth as Orton used the ringside environment on his advantage while Reigns kept fighting with his trademark apron dropkick & superman punch as they continued to counter each other's signature moves while executing their own in a great match.

WWE Champion John Cena vs. Brock Lesnar - Cena attempted to take the fight to Lesnar only for Brock to make it clear after Cena made it clear he was going to 'never give up' in the first minute that Brock smiled while proclaiming ""I'm going to kill you!"" doing what Heyman stated he was going to do for weeks in victimizing Cena slowly & methodically as Cena was able to get little to no offense in before Brock continued to dominate working over the ribs non-stop along with an endless amount of suplexes that went into double digits with Cena refusing to quit & being able to take advantage of the little openings that he had only for Brock to keep countering while laughing at him & even mocking Undertaker at one point demanding his quits before finally putting him out of his misery. This wasn't the competitive battle they've had in the past but it wasn't designed to be as this was exactly what Heyman said it would be for weeks coming into this in that was the most dominate (and possibly long overdue) beat down of John Cena that hasn't been seen since...well since Brock injured his leg over a decade earlier as Brock was Cena's kryptonite in this match.

(Preshow) Rob Van Dam vs. Cesaro - RVD took control early using his educated feet in & outside the ring along with being able to execute rolling thunder on the outside causing Cesaro to resort to illegal tactics to work over RVD with his strength including executing his own version of a rolling thunder as both men traded momentum with RVD continuing to use his leg strength along with attempting to go aerial only for Cesaro to keep catching him either on the ropes or coming off of it resulting in a really good match.

It should also be noted that Hulk Hogan opened the show plugging their network for a price that I can't remember right now but know it's less than $10. Bottom line is that this was one of the best overall events from top to bottom of the year right next to WrestleMania that's worth going out of your way to see.",1408579200,,6801,4.527257933279088
6448283,5,B00KU3Y3KU,"Summerslam 2014 was a great show. I thought from top to bottom it was solid. Roman Reigns against Randy Orton was a great match. Roman is clearly the star of the future. He proved it in this match. Randy Orton is a great wrestler but after he was on top for year after year I got sick of him but this was a big match for him too. Wyatt vs Jericho was a great match too. I thought it helped support the show. It was great to have Jericho back. Jericho's prime years may be fleeting but he still put on great matches and helps elevate the new guys. AJ Lee vs Paige was a good match.

  I really liked Steph vs Brie. It was a good match and Steph hadn't been in the ring for a very long time. It could have been a disater but it comes in handy having a wrestler as a husband. It was an entertaining match. The Miz vs Ziggler was great too. It would be nice to see Ziggler get a push so it was good for him to pick up a strap. Rollins vs Ambrose was a pretty solid match. Two of the young guys who will be the future of the WWE.

  Brock Lesnar vs John Cena was the match of the night. Lesnar beat the piss out of Cena. It was a great fight. As much as I had grown to dislike Cena over the years I thought he did a great job in this match. Cena rarely gets beat and rarely gets beaten like that. This is a important turning point for WWE. Brock Lesnar is their man. He is the biggest attraction and they have to put the title on him. He is a part time wrestler so it will be interesting to see how they work around his limited schedule. I thought I read he signed on for more dates. I stopped watching wrestling for a long time but with the Return of Brock I am interested again and watching more. One wrestler can't save the WWE and make it great again but Brock can make a major impact as Champion and a Top Player.

  Cena with respect has been the glue that kept WWE together. I think wrestling will become great again. I think as Brock Lesnar and other part time wrestlers hold the fort down the next mega stars of wrestling will emerge. It's too bad Brock wouldn't work a full schedule but who knows that could change. Cena is not dead. Like Death and Taxes Cena will always comeback and win. It must be tough for the wrestlers to see Part Time wrestlers comeback and get the spotlight and money. The fact is this is a business and Brock Lesnar is money in the bank. It was too bad Daniel Bryan got hurt. But this is an interesting and exciting time for wrestling gone are the days of Super Cena win every match now we don't exactly know what will happen next with Brock as the champ.",1408320000,3,2586,4.025341130604288
6448284,3,B00KU3Y3KU,"The Intercontinental title match between The Miz & Dolph Ziggler was good with lots of energy to boot. The Divas title match between AJ Lee & Paige was solid at best. The Flag Match between Rusev & Jack Swagger was also good but could have been better if the match was given more time. The Lumberjack Match between Dean Ambrose & Seth Rollins was a fun and crazy bout. The Bray Wyatt-Chris Jericho match was also solid but also could been better if given more time. The Stephanie McMahon-Brie Bella match while not good wrestling,it was entertaining to say the least with a twist ending to boot. The Randy Orton-Roman Reigns match was good but predictable. The WWE World title match between Brock Lesnar & John Cena was a one sided flop and that's unforgivable for a main event on PPV(A Big Four PPV none the less). I give this PPV a 6 out of 10.",1408320000,,846,4.42948717948718
6448285,5,B00KU3Y3KU,"I watched Summerslam tonight on WWE Network and I was amazed with it. This PPV is indeed the biggest event of summer. I will rank the matches 1-5 stars.

1) WWE Intercontinental Championship Match. The Miz (champion) vs. Dolph Ziggler. This match is a good one to kick off the PPV. Miz is too protective of his ""moneymaker"". There were a lot of reversals, and near falls. Ziggler kicked out of the Finale, kicked Miz in the face and he pinned him after an awesome Zig-Zag from nowhere. 4 stars

Winner and new WWE Intercontinental Champion: Dolph Ziggler.

2) WWE Divas Championship Match. AJ Lee (champion) vs Paige. An ok match, but a bit intense. Both of those ladies started to bite and pull each other's hair out. AJ used a cross body on Paige, she even attempted to use the Black Widow on Paige, but it had no effect on the tall challenger and Paige wins the match after she used the RamPaige on AJ Lee. 3 stars.

Winner and new WWE Divas Champion: Paige.

3) Flag Match. Rusev vs. Jack Swagger. Good match and an intense one. Before the match started, Swagger used the Patriot Lock on Rusev to injure him, so he can get the upper hand. But, Swagger's strategy did not work and Rusev used the Accolade on Swagger to he passed out. 3.5 stars.

Winner: Rusev.

4) Lumberjack Match. Seth Rollins vs. Dean Ambrose. This is not a match, this is a BRAWL. The icing of this PPV. Rollins and Ambrose are beating the holy hell out of each other all over the area not even the lumberjacks can separate them until Kane showed up to restore order. Ambrose almost won the match until Kane screwed him again just like at MiTB PPV and the rest of the lumberjacks run in the ring and they brawled each other included Kane. Rollins won the match with a MiTB briefcase shot to the head of Ambrose. Two of the highlights in this match were Ambrose jumped on half of the lumberjacks included Rollins from the top turnbuckle and the lumberjacks brawled each other. 5 stars.

Winner: Seth Rollins.

5) Bray Watt vs. ""Y2J"" Chris Jericho. Better than last time. The creepy Wyatt continues to play mind games on Y2J. Despite the rest of the Wyatt family banned from ringside, Wyatt manhandled Y2J by throwing him to a barricade and a taped thumb to the throat of Y2J. Wyatt kicked out of the Code Breaker and he won a clean pin with the Sister Abigail. 4 stars.

Winner: Bray Watt.

6) Stephanie McMahon vs. Brie Bella. It has been 10 years since Stephanie wrestled. When the Billionaire Dollar Baroness came out, she is ripped thanks to her training with her husband; The Game, HHH. Stephanie manhandled the Yes Man's wife during the entire match. Brie did her best in this match. When Brie locked the Yes Lock on Stephanie, HHH yanked the referee out of the ring and Nikki showed up to help her sister. Oh really, is she? Nikki slapped Brie and Stephanie won the match with the Pedigree and she kissed her husband and they started taunting Daniel Bryan and Brie. I hope Daniel Bryan gets better soon and he will team up with Brie to take on HHH and Stephanie in a tag team match in the future. 3 stars.

Winner: Stephanie McMahon.

7) Roman Reigns vs. Randy Orton. If Reigns is Superman, and Orton is the Kryptonite. Oh really, Orton?. This match started to become a little bored. But, it became intense later. The Apex Predator manhandled Reigns at ringside by slamming him on an announcer's table, shoving him to a turnbuckle post and on the steel steps. There are two sick moves from those men: a sick superplex Orton did to Reigns and a awesome Samoan Drop from the top turnbuckle Reigns did to Orton. Reigns kicked out of the RKO, The Viper countered Reigns' spear to a power slam, the Superman punch to a RKO. If anything else fails, The Viper attempted to use Plan P: Punt Reigns' head off. But, Reigns tripped Orton and he won the match after a spear to Orton. 4.5 stars.

Winner: Roman Reigns

8) Main Event Match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. John Cena (champion) vs, Brock Lesnar with Paul Heyman. When the match started, Lesnar attempted to pin Cena after an F-5, but Cena kicked out. The Beast Incarnate manhandled the Champ just like he did to The Undertaker at WrestleMania and he use those nasty and brutal German Suplexes on Cena 16 times, and he gave hard punches, sick knee shots, and elbow shots to Super Cena. The Champ tried everything to beat the Beast Incarnate even he used the AA and the STF, but he is no match to the bigger, badder, and stronger Brock Lesnar, but I LOVED IT when he destroyed Cena. Lesnar won the match with an brutal F-5. 4.5 stars.

Winner and new WWE World Heavyweight Champion: Brock Lesnar.

I am a Paul Heyman guy and an fan of Brock Lesnar since day one. I gave this PPV a 9 star rank.",1408233600,11,4734,4.460648148148148
6448286,4,B00KU3Y3KU,"I.C Title: The Miz vs. Dolph Ziggler
I liked this match a lot. The Miz played a great heel and ziggler hit some sick moves. When miz hit his finisher I thought it was over. At the end ziggler won, I am so happy. 3/5

Divas Title: AJ Lee vs. Paige
This was better than the battleground match. Both divas looked hot but also I liked the story between these two. At the end Paige hit a sick DDT to win. 3/5

Flag Match: Jack Swagger vs. Rusev
This was a good match. But it was just a singles match. I was kind of confused. But both guys sold a injury, the ending was cool. 3/5

Lumberjack Match: Seth Rollins vs. Dean Ambrose
This was a great match. I don't like lumberjacks but this was crazy. It went into the crowd and the lumberjacks were all over the place. Rollins won but ambrose will get revenge. 4/5

Chris Jericho vs. Bray Wyatt
I liked this match better than there last. It was really cool at the end with the spider walk. At the end wyatt won the same way he did at royal rumble. 3/5

Stephanie McMahon vs. Brie Bella
This was entertaining, Stephanie was dominating Brie. At the end Nikki turning heel was predictable but we will see how it comes out. 3/5

Roman Reigns vs. Randy Orton
This was so boring at the beginning. But then it got real good towards the end. Orton hit a sick rko, then he tried to hit a punt but meant a spear. 3/5

WWE World Title: John Cena vs. Brock Lesnar
This was awesome, lesnar destroyed cena. He hit 16 German Superplexes, he hit two F-5 then got the clean win. 4/5

Overall Show: I loved this show, I was so happy with ziggler, wyatt, paige and lesnar winning. Watch this show.",1408233600,11,1619,4.183279742765273
6448287,5,B00KU3Y3KU,"RVD vs Cesaro: Cesaro's losing streak is getting annoying when he is the most talented guy they have right now. And after RVD winning tonight with the Five Star Frog Splash, watch him go back to jobbing tomorrow to lesser talents than Cesero.
  Dolph Zigger vs the Miz (IC Title): I thought this one was predictable since Ziggler has won non-title matches vs the Miz. So thought the Miz had this one but Ziggler won with a zig zag to be the new champ.
  Paige vs AJ Lee: This is a nice feud and these 2 have solid matches that deserve to be as long as Stephanie vs Brie was. And yes this is mostly due to me never getting tired of how hot Paige is as a heel skipping mocking AJ. After much brawling, biting and AJ pulling out Paige's hair, Paige won by reversing AJ's submission finisher into a cradle DDT.
  Rusev vs Swagger: I know by now that if anyone will beat Rusev it's Cena of course. This match was predictable but not bad nevertheless since it was actually a decent wrestling match with plenty of reversals and close wins for Swagger. Rusev won by making Swagger pass out to the camel clutch.
  Rollins vs Ambrose in a LumberJack match: they brawled all over the place in one of the better lumberjack matches. But Kane made it obvious Rollins would win when he got himself involved as a lumberjack. Ambrose had the match won with the curb stomp on Rollins. Kane broke up the pin though. Rollins then one by hitting Ambrose with the Money in the Bank briefcase.
  Stephanie vs Brie Bella: This was another predictable one since I heard for some weeks now predictions that Nikki will turn on Brie. I was hoping Brie would still win though. But Nikki did turn on Brie when it looked like they were going to double team Stephanie. Nikki shoved Stephanie out of the way and decked Brie. Brie then got a pedigree by Stephanie to lose the match.
  Bray Wyatt vs Jericho: solid match and Jericho almost won with the codebreaker but Bray kicked out. Bray then hit Sister Abrigal for the win after knocking out Jericho outside the ring, forget what he actually did though.
  Reigns vs Orton: This one was surprisingly not bad. Orton reversing the spear in a powerslam was a good moment. Reigns kicking out of an RKO was cool too. Reigns eventually won with a spear on Orton.
  Brock Lesnar vs John Cena (WWE Unified Title): Cena in the promo for the match said he'd destroy Lesnar but I'm happy to say it was the other way to around. Lesnar hit an F5 right away and Cena kicked out. Lesnar hit many nasty looking German Suplexes on Cena after that and did many ground and pounds. And yes the beat down did get a little boring I admit since there was way too many of the same moves by Lesnar, that's right Lesnar, not Cena. I can't think of much else he did other than a German suplex.
  Cena eventually did get offense and hit an AA but Lesnar kicked out. Cena also got the STF on Lesnar but Lesnar got out and quickly hit the F5 again for the win. I hope there's not a rematch right away that Cena will obviously win. I rather see Lesnar defend again people he never faced before that happens. Lesnar vs Reigns at Night of Champions has more potential than Cena vs Lesnar again. And Lesnar vs Batista should finally happen as well.",1408233600,2,3232,4.367278797996661
6448288,4,B00KU3Y3KU,"1.) Intercontinental Championship Match: The Miz (c) vs Dolph Ziggler

Decent opening match to kick off the festivities. Not many expected Ziggler to win but in a shocking turn of events; Ziggler won his second IC Title with a Zig-Zag on The Miz

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) Diva's Championship Match: Paige vs AJ Lee (c)

A slight improvement of their Battleground match. Unfortunately this match was way too short for a rematch. AJ gets in an impressive crossbody off the top rope onto Paige mid-way through. Paige reverses a Black Widow into the Paige Turner to win her second Diva's Championship. Decent match but too short to make it anything above that

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) Flag Match: Rusev w/Lana vs Jack Swagger

Unlike Flag matches in the past where the way to win was to retrieve the flag from a pole; the way to win this match was by pinfall or submission. The winner would have their respective flag raised while their country's national anthem blared throughout the arena. This was a pretty good match from Rusev and Swagger. Lots of back and forth motions with a few false finishes here and there. Rusev wins after Swagger passes out in The Accolade and has the Russian national anthem played. Great match with a nice 1980s Cold War feel to it

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) Lumberjack Match: Seth Rollins vs Dean Ambrose

The match that many had been waiting to see since June finally happened! All the faces and heels not on the SummerSlam card stood ringside as the lumberjacks. This was probably the most intense and extreme Lumberjack Match in WWE history---I kid you not! Ambrose and Rollins tore it down in this match! Nearing the end; all hell breaks loose---following an interference from Kane and Rollins clocks Ambrose with his MITB briefcase behind the referee's back and gets the pinfall win on Ambrose. Without a doubt a hellacious Lumberjack Match! This feud is far from over and I think I speak for everyone when I say; I'm looking forward to their next encounter!

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) Bray Wyatt vs Chris Jericho

Before the match starts; we get amazing entrances from Bray and Jericho. Jericho brought back his countdown with a badass 2014 twist too it as well as an amazing upgraded jacket. Their match was as great as their entrances. Although the opening bits start off a bit slow; Bray and Jericho pick up the pace and put on a great showing with the crowd split down the middle for the 2. After a fascinating back and forth bout; Bray plows Y2J to the mat with a Sister Abigail for the win. Incredible psychological match that told a story from these 2 amazing athletes

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) Stephanie McMahon vs Brie Bella

This feud has been sizzling since the June Payback PPV where Brie slapped Stephanie McMahon and quit the company. Over time Stephanie punished Nikki for Brie's actions with a multitude of ludicrous one-sided matches which eventually brought Brie out of the shadows and back to the ring for this match. For Stephanie's first match since No Mercy 2003, she was actually pretty impressive here. If you follow the internet dirtsheets, then it didn't take a brain surgeon to figure out how this one ended. A double interference from Triple H and Nikki Bella, sees Nikki turn on Brie (surprise, surprise) and allow Stephanie to Pedigree her sister for the win. The build-up to the match was amazing but the match itself was entirely too predictable. Not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing in this case

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

7.) Randy Orton vs Roman Reigns

Meh. Boring match in my opinion. Reigns and Orton don't belong in the ring together. Slightly impressive here and there but overall it was lackluster. Reigns wins with a Spear on Orton

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

8.) WWE World Heavyweight Championship Match: Brock Lesnar w/Paul Heyman vs John Cena

Good grief! What an abomination of a ""match"" this was! This wasn't even a match! It was more of a german suplex fest! The match starts with Lesnar hitting an F5 out of nowhere and Cena kicks out. From there on out, it's just an endless supply of german suplexes. And considering that Lesnar and Cena were absent for most of the build-up; there wasn't much to look forward to. The amount of german suplexes thrown out in this match was just overkill. In the end; Super Cena can't take anymore suplexes and Lesnar hits an F5 to win his 4th World Title. If you're extremely anti-Cena; then you probably think this is the greatest main event moment/match in SummerSlam history. But if you're realistic, this is probably the worst SummerSlam main event match

Overall: Fairly good SummerSlam PPV. The build-up for the matches was incredible and most of the matches delivered. The only disappointments were AJ vs Paige (due to it's shortness), Roman Reigns vs Randy Orton, and John Cena vs Brock Lesnar. Everything else was pretty satisfying",1408233600,,5431,5.540507859733978
6448289,4,B00KU3Y3KU,"I watched this PPV event live on the WWE Network and decided to do a eview for anyone who plans on buying the DVD off of amazon, so you know what you're getting.  I am not a journalist or any official, I am just a fan who loves writing reviews for WWE events.  My review does contain spoilers, so here's I will provide a quick review.  However if you do not care or look up the results on the internet, check out my review before you buy. Quick Review:

Dolph Ziggler vs. The Miz: 4.5/5
Paige vs. AJ Lee: 4/5
Rusev vs. Jack Swagger: 3.5/5
Dean Ambrose vs. Seth Rollins; Lumberjack match: 5/5 (match of the night)
Bray Wyatt vs. Chris Jericho: 4.5/5
Stephanie McMahon vs. Brie Bella: 3/5
Randy Orton vs. Roman Reigns: 4/5
John Cena vs. Brock Lesnar: 1/5

Detailed review:

1. Intercontinental Champion The Miz vs. Dolph Ziggler: Very physical and exciting battle here. Both men went back and forth and took some really hard shots from eachother, reversals, nearfalls, and Ziggler getting the win with a very impressive Zig Zag out of no where.  I think it could've gone longer but still a great opener and Ziggler FINALLY gets a championship he deserves it.

Overall rating: 4.5/5 stars

2. Diva's Champion AJ Lee vs. Paige: This was an AWESOME Diva's championship match.  Both Diva's went at it here and put on a hell of a performance with is rare as far as Diva matches go nowadays.  From ripping eachothers hair out to AJ Lee diving off the top rope onto Paige, this match had plenty of good moments for the amount of time it was given. Paige gets the victory after the ""RamPaige"" in what was a short but great match-up.

Overall rating: 4/5 stars

3. Rusev vs Jack Swagger; Flag match: This was a decent match.  Kind of slow through the beginning but really picked in the middle and end.  Rusev sold an ankle injury from the start and had to use a modified Accolade towards the end because of it.  I was at the edge of my seat when Swagger had the Patriot Lock locked in but Rusev managed to get out of it and locked Swagger in the Accolade for the victory.  Really think Swagger deserved the victory here but hopefully we'll see Rusev either go for a title or in a feud where he will actually lose next.

Overall rating: 3.5/5 stars

4. Dean Ambrose vs Seth Rollins; Lumberjack match: Finally Ambrose and Rollins squared off, and boy what a crazy match it was.  Agasin another match that should've gone on longer but for the time it had it was amazing.  This match was very physical and they even went out into the crowd and fought until Corporate Kane came out and demanded order be restored.  The action in the ring was exciting and at the very end after Kane interrupted a pinfall attempt by Ambrose all the Lumberjacks entered the ring and began fighting.  It was during this that Rollins would hit Ambrose over the head with the MiTB briefcase which would allow him to steal the victory.  Still, an awesome match and I hope this feud continues at least to Hell in a Cell.

Overall rating: 5/5 stars

5. Bray Wyatt vs. Chris Jericho: A rematch from Battleground, Wyatt looked to even the score here at SummerSlam.  I didn't watch that match but I heard it was a boring contest.  This match was not.  Bray Wyatt and Chris Jericho put on a great match-up in my opinion, aving Harper and Rowan banned from ringside really helped too. It wasn't a technically sound classic but it was an extremely physical bout where both men had great moments.  The crowd, like myself, was split on who they wanted to win and their chants proved it.  I loved when Wyatt did his spiderwalk or whatever it's called when Jericho went for the lionsault then screamed ""I am already dead!"" at Y2J.  The Sister Abigail into the barricade was awesome too., which he then followed with one in the ring to get the victory.  Definitely made up for their lackluster Battleground bout

Overall rating: 4.5/5

6. Brie Bella vs. Stephanie McMahon: First of all Stephanie's attire gets a 5/5 rating straight out the gate, HHH is one lucky guy.  Not as lucky as Daniel Bryan though.  Anyway, this match had great build-up and was highly anticipated.  I thought it was an okay contest, better than I expected honestly but not as good as Paige vs. AJ earlier in the night, but I doubt anyone expected it too be.  It did it's job in making Steph look good in the ring for not having wrestled in over a decade and also letting Brie finally get her hands on the ""Billion Dollar Princess"".  Triple H and Nikki Bella come out and we see Triple H yank the referee out of the ring while Brie had the Yes Lock locked in, which resulted in Brie giving HHH an awesome baseball slide.  The ending where Nikki betrayed Brie kinda surprised me, I mean we all knew it was coming because that's how WWE works but still it surprised me on this night.  Stephanie then gets the win after a Pedigree in a decent match with better storytelling

Overall rating: 3/5

7. Randy Orton vs. Roman Reigns: Another highly anticipated match, and also another great match as The Viper takes on The Powerhouse. Orton put on his best performance in a long time against the rising star in Reigns. Reigns also put on the performance of his life and took everything Orton dished out while getting some licks in himself.  This match was methodical as Orton matches usually are.  That superplex was superb.  That RKO outta nowhere was excellent too.  Just a great match-up with Reigns getting the victory after a Spear.

Overall rating: 4/5

8. WWE World Heavyweight Champion John Cena vs Brock Lesnar:  Probably the most hyped match in SummerSlam history, Lesnar and Cena was promised to be an amazing contest.  It was, however, one of the most boring matches I've ever seen.  The whole match was literally this:  Beginning flurry that ends with an early F-5 by Lesnar for a 2 count, Lesnar stalks Cena for about 6 or 7 minutes (felt like 20 minutes) delivering a few knees to the body and several german suplexes, Cena mounts a brief comeback and delivers an Attitude Adjustment for a 2 count, Lesnar again attacks Cena with german suplexes, brief flurry towards the end and then an F-5 by Lesnar to end the match.  Going in, I was hoping to God for a Lesnar victory.  But not this way, no0t in such a boring encounter.  Yes, it was Lesnar beating the living s*** out of Cena.  But with ONE move, besides his finisher and strikes.  Very, very disappointed with this match.

Overall rating: 1/5 stars

The only thing that truly disappointed was the very hyped main event between Brock Lesnar and John Cena.  The rest of the card, outstanding.  But the main event, I just can't described how disappointed I am with the match, considering the person I hoped would win going in actually did win.

6448299,4,B00KU3Y3KU,"There are very few times when a wrestling fan can feel surprised anymore; there's a strong, pervasive feeling that we as a fanbase have seen everything there is to see inside the squared circle, which means there are depths to plumb and no peaks to climb. Going into ""SummerSlam"", I was hoping to see a good show, but I never even considered the possibility that the WWE would go the way they did.

Everything was about the two main events on the show and both delivered in unexpected ways. The first was a match between Stephanie McMahon and Brie Bella that was tremendously booked and performed when Stephanie controlled the match. Even better was Triple H who sold a Bella dropkick, leered at Nikki and had one of the single greatest evil laughs in professional wrestling history. (He went full-belly evil, folks.) The other was the systematic destruction of John Cena by Brock Lesnar in the WWE World Title match. It was a gutsy, unexpected and thrilling choice to see Cena get beaten down like no World Champion has before. And to do it at a big show like ""SummerSlam"" only made it more surprising. The match had a big fight, realistic feel to it that wrestling has difficulty achieving.

The undercard pretty much featured nothing but solid matches, though I wouldn't say anything was spectacular. The best mid-card bout was a Lumberjack match between Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose that wasn't much of a match but succeeded as an out of control brawl. The other really good match was a Flag match between Rusev and Jack Swagger that had a bruising, stiff quality much like the main event. Other good bouts included an IC Title bout between Ziggler/Miz, a Divas Title match with AJ/Paige, and a solid encounter between Randy Orton and Roman Reigns.

If there was a match that disappointed, it was Chris Jericho vs. Bray Wyatt. It was better than their previous match at ""Battleground"", but it was still lethargic and lacked proper build up to make the slower moments dramatic. Thankfully, they capped off their feud with a great Cage match on Raw a week later.

In the end, there aren't any match of the year contenders on this show; however, the genuine sense of surprise and care put into each bout was generally superior than what the WWE typically gives us, so I can give this an easy recommendation. Best PPV since ""WrestleMania"" or maybe even ""SummerSlam"" the previous year.",1411776000,2,2385,4.739759036144578

SUMMERSLAM 2014

1.[I-C TITLE]THE MIZ VS DOLPH ZIGGLER-excellent opening match with two of my favorites going at it. Miz is always super funny and performs well and Ziggler is without a doubt one of the best and extremely underrated by the WWE. Great back and forth action with near falls including a close call for Ziggler. The match ends when Ziggler hits a surprise Zig Zag, great match with a new I-C champ in Ziggler.

2.[DIVA TITLE]AJ LEE VS PAIGE-one of the best Divas matches in a while and that makes sense. With these two I always know that I am going to get something good. These two battle it out and are very aggressive including a dive to the outside of the top rope. That is not the norm for a Divas match especially with most of the others. Paige ends up taking the belt back after a great reversal.

3.[FLAG MATCH]JACK SWAGGER VS RUSEV-not the typical Flag match that most remember. Instead of fighting to reach your flag and thereby obtain the win instead you flag would be waived if you won. Not the best of stipulations but it works, especially with this story. Rusev had been a beast and tearing down America and its American wrestlers. So Swagger really took it to him in this match as both men got really physical. This was  good battle that would see the Russian once again come out on top.

4.[LUMBERJACK MATCH]SETH ROLLINS VS DEAN AMBROSE-one of the best and craziest Lumberjack matches ever. These two have a great back and forth match that very often involves the lumberjacks on the outside. This is also the only Lumberjack match I can remember where both guys get past the jacks and fight way into the crowd, first in at least a while. Once back in the ring it doesnt take long for everyone to get involved only for Rollins to nail Ambrose with the MITB briefcase for the win. This was a great match and maybe my favorite on the card.

5. BRAY WYATT VS CHRIS JERICHO-one of my favorite matches on the card. These two complement each other well and have great matches. This was a really good one with Bray looking very good here. He takes it to Y2J and eventually getting the win. This was one of the best matches on the card. Jericho looked well here almost getting the win himself but Wyatt goes over.

6. STEPHANIE MCMAHON VS BRIE BELLA-I was actually looking forward to this match. Steph has always been great at playing the heel and was perfect in the buildup. I am not a big Bella fan so I was all about Steph getting the win here. She looked great in this match like she hadnt missed a beat since her last match something like a decade prior. She even received the you still got it chant form the crowd. She really takes it to Brie here but Brie holds her own. In the end it wouldnt be triple H that made the difference it would be Bries sister, Nicki. She would turn on her sister and align with The Authority in this feud.

7. ROMAN REIGNS VS RANDY ORTON-I don't know what it is about Randy Orton but he seems to be one of those guys that brings out the best in reigns. Any time these two are on opposite sides, single or tag, Reigns shines. This is an excellent match that really is hard hitting. Randy is quick and cunning and showcases that with that powerslam from the attempted spear or that RKO. Reigns looks really good here nailing all those signatures and kicking out of an RKO, he gets the win after a successful spear.

8.[WWE TITLE]JOHN CENA VS BROCK LESNAR-this match was a beat down, Cena was dominated from the start. When this match was happening live I thought for sure he would make an unbelievable comeback superhero style to sell shirts and such. Plus it fits his character and felt like something that the WWE would book. Now I am a fan of Cena but I loved this match. They made Lesnar look like the beast they call him. He threw Cena all over the ring tossing and suplexing everywhere. Cena had moments of offense but not enough to make a difference. Lesanr takes the title, takes the title.

BONUS

1. RVD VS CESARO-two excellent wrestlers go at it here. This was a great back and forth affair with each man having moments to shine. Various great moments between the two really made me think they should have been given more time and put on the PPV. RVD gets the win here after a 5 Star Frogsplash of course.

You also get a look at Bray and Y2Js rivalry as well as interviews with Reigns and Nicki Bella. This was a really good event with some good matches and even a straight beat down. If you are a wrestling fan I say check it out. This is a good DVD, I really need to get the Blu-Ray.",1435968000,,4554,4.351001177856301
