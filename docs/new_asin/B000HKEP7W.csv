8140109,5,B000HKEP7W,"This story is incredible... Adolf Hitler had a brother who lived and married in Liverpool, England for a short while. Adolf visited the brother and his wife in Liverpool when he was ""down and out"" and an eyewitness to this is interviewed. This brother, named Alois Hitler, fathered a son named William Patrick Hitler who grew up in England but worked in Germany for a while because his uncle Adolf helped him get some good jobs. But William Patrick tried to blackmail his Uncle (to get a high-ranking job) and had to get out of Germany quickly when his plan backfired. Just before the War, he emigrated to the U.S. and went on an anti-Adolf speaking tour. He even joined the U.S. Navy and fought for the U.S... Then, after the War, he disappeared and changed his name. Most of this documentary is about the many years of hard detective work it took to track down William Patrick and his family and what they had to say when interviewed. One son of William Patrick became an IRS Auditor. How would you like to be audited by a Hitler!?! Actually, this family has been a model American family. The sons of William Patrick are alive and well and living in the US to this day under an assumed name. The males in the family have a resemblance to Uncle Adolf and technically, under German law, they probably have a strong legal claim on the legacy of Adolf which are the royalties of the book Mein Kampf. These royalties are estimated to be more than $30,000,000, but they say it is ""blood money"" and will not pursue it. I found the most-interesting part to be about Hitler's nephew, William Patrick, the early interviews of him and what became of him.",1172534400,2,1645,4.523489932885906
