4833899,3,B005M2AKLA,the one pictured has 2 track audio on all 4 films the one not pictured has 4 difrent colored picts of pinhead. the 3rd tital is in 5.0 all the rest are in 2.0 2 channel sound .both sets the 3rd tital is widescreen all the same lengths and same titals. Blu Ray is 25 gig capasity so they could have made them all 5.0  the pict quality is the same on both,1330214400,,353,3.835616438356164
4833900,5,B005M2AKLA,"I'll admit, I was a bit skeptical when this was first announced. 4 movies on 1 disc? Surely the quality can't be that great, right? But then I thought back on the Hellraiser series and realized that these were never about top-quality cinematography. This is pure fun, especially for fans of the series.

That said, the picture and audio quality is actually quite good. The picture is clear, perhaps ever-so-slightly softened...but much better than on DVD. And really, for the price of $2.50 per movie...on Blu-ray, this is a must have for horror and Hellraiser fans alike.",1325289600,5,572,4.896907216494846
4833901,4,B005M2AKLA,"I've heard quite a few poor reviews on Miramax/Echo Bridge who seem to put out the lower end Blu-Rays. I personally think this was a pretty solid release. As long as you know what your getting yourself into with the Hellraiser films =).

First and foremost as the other reviewer stated, each movie is presented in 1080P except Inferno which is my favorite of the series and is presented in 1080i. It still looks pretty good mind you. All four films come on one Dual Layered Blu-Ray with no subtitles. And the 5.1 surround is only on Hellworld while the others are 2.0.

Without going into an in depth review and synopsis of each film, they all pretty much have the same tie in. There is a puzzle box known as the Lament Configuration which when manipulated correctly opens a gateway from hell. Hence Pinhead and his friends, the Cenobites, always come through to murder, torture, and trick the protagonist(s) in each of the film(s).

Most people would argue with me but my favorites in the series are Inferno (V) and Hellseeker (VI). I enjoy more of the thriller/mystery genre compared to the bloody/slasher genre the other films seem to offer.

This was a pre-order on a few web sites for $7.99 and can now be purchased for $9.99 in most stores. Four films with a decent video quality, most certainly better than there DVD counterparts for ten bucks ain't half bad.  The stories can vary and may not be everyone's cup of tea, but should keep your attention and they always have this cool and creepy underlying feeling due to the hell aspect, and our friend Pinhead.

Video Quality: C (sadly Inferno is only 1080i, they all look pretty good though)
Audio Quality :C- (can be on the low side, even with my sound bar I have to raise the volume pretty high)
Aesthetics: C (they could have made the print a little larger on the back cover, and the characters on the front don't match the films they coincide with.)
Price: A+
Extras: F (None at all, not even separate menus for each film,besides the initial choosing what movie you'd like to watch. And no subtitles at all brings this set down grade wise a lot.)
Overall: C+

Great for a horror movie night, or just a fan of these films in general. I recommend this set, especially for it's cheap price on Blu-Ray.",1322956800,21,2259,4.5492610837438425
4833902,3,B005M2AKLA,"Pros:
-Each movie only cost around $2.50 if you get this for the right price.
-To my knowledge this is the only way to get Hellseeker on blu ray at this time.

Cons:
-All four movies have been compressed onto the same disc, this will almost definitely have a negative effect on picture quality.
-Only one of the four movies has surround sound, the other three are left with 2.0
-No special features
-No separate menus, just an initial screen that has you select between the four movies and then they start up as soon as you choose.

Bottom Line:
If your able to get this set for really cheap ($12 or less) and your looking to own these movies just for the sake of one day owning all the Hellraiser movies, then I say pick it up. However if you seriously liked any of these movies your better off getting individual releases because the lack of surround sound and special features may be a deal breaker.",1320710400,23,902,4.395209580838324
4833903,3,B005M2AKLA,I'm glad they brought the hellraisers into blu ray. But I'm just disappointed on how they placed all the film's on one disk. The sound is only in mono. The picture quality is not bad. I just wished they bought the film's out separately and not on one disk,1406678400,,255,4.224489795918367
4833904,5,B005M2AKLA,"So I saw this gem and decided that, oh, well, they're on Blu-ray, so why not? I found a Japanese import box set of the first three ""Hellraiser"" films. Those, combined with ""Deader"" and ""Revelations,"" made for the complete series on Blu-ray. I heard that studio finagling is the reason why we will most likely never see all nine films in one neat little package. But the transfer on this one is decent, and I am a huge fan of the series, so I'm content.",1406419200,,452,4.329411764705882

4833908,3,B005M2AKLA,"Ok. I rate this Bluray Collection as mediocre! The price was right, but the movies themselves are lacking! If you are looking to own these movies, this is the way to go for the price! Otherwise, the movies themselves are shallow at best! Plots are subpar! The creators of these films were certainly reaching! I suppose there is some entertainment value, but it is minimal! But again, you can't beat the price!",1385596800,,409,4.694444444444445
4833909,2,B005M2AKLA,"As a huge Hellraiser fan it is disappointing that there is no collector's box set for this 9-film franchise. The best we get is a 4-pack from Echo Bridge due to rights issues. We get Hellraiser 4, 5, 6 and 8 on one Blu-Ray: Bloodline, Inferno, Hellseeker, and Hellworld. The forgettable Hell on Earth, Deader and Revelations aren't included. The best of the series are the first two films: Hellraiser and Hellbound but they aren't here either so you will have to buy them separately on Blu-Ray. There has also been rumors for years about a Never Sleep Again/Crystal Lake Memories retrospective documentary on the franchise but we won't go there. The advantage to this set is owning 4 Hellraiser films on one disc. It's priced well and worth a purchase if you don't own a copy yet. Bare-bones doesn't fly with some people. Even the Dario Argento Box Set had 5 films and decent bonus material! Oddly, Hell on Earth doesn't seem to be available on Blu-Ray at all but the other 8 films got a release. The Hellraiser Collection on DVD is the same price so fans must decide for themselves what version to own. You get two more movies and the video and audio quality are very similar in the DVD.",1377302400,,1188,4.55607476635514
4833910,5,B005M2AKLA,"Picked this up at Wal-Mart when it first came out for just at the $10.00 mark. Well worth the money for this set. At this price now of $5.99 on amazon, it is a steal. The picture quality is good on all of the movies, and the sound is decent and gets the job done. You will be much happier with this than even the older DVD releases. The new DVD re-releases, people should stay away from",1373760000,2,386,4.025974025974026

The video quality was really, really good. I am a huge fan of all the Hellraiser films.",1370390400,2,255,4.333333333333333
4833912,4,B005M2AKLA,"I'm building up a collection of Hellraiser Blu-Rays. I believe I'm missing three films, but this booster pack of sorts is great to have.

Of course, no candle to the original. But great if you simply cannot get enough of Pinhead. And I certainly cannot get enough of Pinhead.",1367625600,,275,4.612244897959184
