7452251,5,B015UE84BC,"NOTE: The first part of this review was based on the 2-disc DVD version. The second is a review of the Deluxe edition.

In celebration of what would have been Frank Sinatras 100th birthday (had he lived beyond 1998) on December 12th, the folks at Eagle Rock Entertainment are releasing the (just over four hour) documentary Sinatra: All or Nothing At All documentary that airs on HBO in three formats  which can be frustrating for Sinatra fans.

I was provided with an advance screening copy of the 2-sisc DVD set in exchange for an objective review. This is exactly the same as the Bluray set. There is also a Deluxe DVD set, which I am still hoping to get to provide a more thorough review.  The various formats will be frustrating to true Sinatra fans and I hope here to provide accurate info  and Ill update if I get the Deluxe version. (see end of review for update)

First off, the heart of all the versions is the documentary  Sinatra: all or Nothing At All. It is being released under the HBO Documentary Films label  though HBOs name does not appear at beginning of the firm. It was made to air over two nights so it comes in two Parts. The first runs 1 hour 58 minutes; the second runs 2 hours and 6 minutes.  Part one goes from his birth in 1915 to his Oscar win (for From Here To Eternity in 1953. Part 2 goes from there to the 1971 Retirement Concert and quickly up to 1984 and then back to 1978 for his last hit: New York New York.
The director uses the 1971 Concert as a thread to tell Sinatras story. At that concert  where he was planning to end his career (at only age 55) because his last album, Watertown, was a flop  he same 11 songs which told his life story up till them. These songs, and PARTS of the 1971 performance of them, form the chapters in the film.

There are lots of amazing photos and archival footage shown on the screen. There are also comments from those folks who knew him. We hear from his first wife, Nancy, his daughters (Nancy Jr. and Tina) and his son, Frank Jr. (who refers to his dad, not as dad or my father, but as Sinatra.  Archival and recent  its not always clear which  comments are provided by Harry James, Sammy Davis Jr. Mitch Miller, Tony Bennett. Mia Farrow (form wife), Sammy Cahn and more. There is no narrator but the comments by Wall St Journal journalist Terry Teachout often serves that purpose.  What will surprise you (it did me) is that NONE of the interviewees are shown on screen (except  Jerry Lewis and thats only in a deleted scene). And a few of the comments are read by actors (Gina Gershon reads the word of Ava Gardner, one of Sinatras four wives).
Its not all about the music and so we have long sections dedicate to Sinatras involvement in politics (the Kennedy brothers) and the mob.
Of all the archival video clips included (besides the 1971 concert) the ones I found most interesting were the Interview with Walter Cronkite in 1979 and another where he spoke at Yale in 1996.  For the Cronkite interview, the footage is edited so that we hear Cronkite ask a question and we never hear the answer. In the talk at Yale, Sinatra is open about his life choices and I only wish that it was made available in full somewhere.

For the two-disc DVD as well as the 2 BD package (Im told) contain just the film plus ONE special feature -5 audio-only reminiscences plus that one video of Jerry Lewis. These total 13 minutes. The package also includes a small 4  x 5  inch 16 page color booklet filled with photos and a 4-page essay by Sinatra authority Charles Pignone. The essay really concentrates on that 1971 concert  which, as I said earlier, is only represented in the film by clips (no full uninterrupted performances.

There are subtitles options in FIVE languages (Sinatras reach is certainly international).. And I should mention that there are quite a few EXPLETIVES so be prepared if you get offended by the ""F"" and ""S"" words.

Now we come to the Deluxe Edition which, as I said earlier, I haven't seen (yet). That package (which Amazon appears to be offering for just $10. More than the Blu-ray) contains the documentary on 2 DVDs (not BDs), plus a DVD with the FULL 1971 concert, a CD of the concert, a DVD of the complete Cronkite interview and two booklet (though I don't know size or contents of those.).

So, Eagle Vision has made fans who want Hi def sound and image as well as seeing the full concert and interview quite unhappy. Theyd need to both. Quite frustrating.

So, my current thinking is that  if you are just curious about the singers life, and didn't see it on HBO, the DVD or BD will fill four hours for you. But real Sinatra fans will find themselves going for the deluxe set.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful. As I said, I will update it if I get the Deluxe edition. My four star rating is based on the two-disc versions

ADDITIONAL info added after getting the Deluxe Version (Added 11/19/15)
After having just spent another three hours with the Deluxe version of the Sinatra All or Nothing At All set  which arrived today, I feel I can provide a bit more guidance for buyer. Note that this an objective review provided in exchange for an advance copy of the FINAL set. I plan to provide even more details by Saturday but  because Amazon is offering a special advance purchase price on the Deluxe version and it may end by the release date tomorrow (11/20), I wanted to share the following info to guide you. (And I have no financial interest in this release!)
The Deluxe set comes in a box with a few small booklets and a set of illustrated cards. No big deal  really

There is the two DVD version of the four-hour documentary which aired on HBO. No its not Bluray  but there is no reason to have the Bluray (trust me!)

It does have two additional DVDs:
First is what folks are calling the Walter Cronkite interview. Thats a misnomer. It is a 47 minute show produced by CBS News in 1965 titled Sinatra with Walter Cronkite It was produced by Don Hewitt (60 Minutes creator) and written by Andy Rooney. The face to face interview with Cronkite takes up maybe 16 minutes of the show. The rest is WONDERFUL coverage of Sinatra in the studio (recording a complete song), We see him in a prison  again with a FULL song and another really-fun section of Frank, Dean, Sammy and Johnny Carson that goes on for about 10 minutes. Believe it or not, this may be even better than the documentary. Its honest and informative. The print (black and white) is Very good to excellent. No  not high-def but nicely preserved. There are subtitles in 5 languages.
Next is the 1971 Retirement Concert  excerpted in the HBO doc. It runs 43 minutes on a separate DVD (interestingly it is Region free  as is the Cronkite. The quality is good but this was never filmed for commercial use. It was a fund raising dinner. As you learn in the HBO doc, the microphone went out during the opening number so there is lots of echo there. This obviously could not be fixed. Later on you will hear hiss  again. It cant be corrected. But you are here for an amazing performance so enjoy it. You can choose a song selection  No subtitles on this DVD

Last comes the CD of the concert. All 11 songs are here  along with Roz Russels intro.  And you get the same sound as on the DVD meaning the opener will have echo as the sound was recorded from the monitors and speakers  not the mic. AND two songs are not complete. As the note on the last page of the booklet enclosed states:""Tracks 2 and 3 are not complete due to a power outage.""

Since, personally, I cant see need for the Bluray of the doc  and the Concert DVD and CD and the beautifully preserved (and entertaining) Cronkite show are only $20.00 more (as of today) on Amazon, any Sinatra fan will want to get the deluxe set. (and, in my opinion, there is no reason to gripe about why it is not on BD.

Ill refine my review by Saturday.

I hope this info is helpful.

7452266,5,B015UE84BC,"After seeing a small amount of Part 2 of this on HBO, I was excited to order the BluRay version of this.  And although I haven't watched it yet, I know it will be great.  But here's why I'm writing this review:  I was hesitant to purchase this item, as Amazon incorrectly shows it as a 90-minute total Run Time (it was originally a 4-part series on HBO, each episode running approx 1 hr).  I even emailed Amazon Customer Service, questioning it, but they could not verify the Run Time.  So after seeing the run time listed correctly at 259 minutes on other sites, I took a chance and ordered it.  Got it yesterday, and I'm looking at the back cover, and it shows 'Part 1 Run Time:  118 mins' and 'Part 2 Run Time: 141 mins'.  So just in case that's holding you back, don't worry about it, because I'm writing this as I look at the item, and it is indeed a 259 minute run time on 2 BluRay discs.  I've written Amazon Customer Service as well with this info, and suggested that they fix the info.  Enjoy!

First up is the region-free double DVD ""All or Nothing At All"", the excellent HBO documentary on the life of Frank Sinatra. This makes the set available to a much larger audience as the alternative stand alone double disk set is in Blu-ray format only. This documentary contains only tiny snippets of his Final Concert. Worth the price of admission is a separate casing for a DVD and audio CD set of his final first-time around retirement concert in June 1971. Initially Sinatra was opposed to televising the concert, but changed his mind at such short notice that the producers had to scramble to capture anything at all on the night. Hence the audio and separately the video have minor deficiencies that are forgivable in the circumstances of this artistically unique event. The Final Concert is accompanied by a booklet plus a facsimile of the Life Magazine article covering the event. Separately again is a quarter hour DVD of a rare interview Sinatra gave, but only to someone with the stature of Walter Cronkite. Finally there is a wallet with six art cards spanning his career.

To say the least when I heard this story of his life was going to be released I was excited and ordered it ahead of time. I was not disappointed in the least. This DVD ""All OR Nothing At All"" blends the story of Frank Sinatra life and his music in a way that by the end of the movie I felt I knew him not only as an artist but as a man. The way the lyrics to his songs were woven into the story of his life brought a much deeper understanding of his music and who he was as an artist.
