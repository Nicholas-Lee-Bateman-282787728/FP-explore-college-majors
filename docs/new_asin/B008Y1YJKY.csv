8532304,4,B008Y1YJKY,"I've watched this film twice and really enjoyed it both times.  It starts with a lively and, for that reason, fairly convincing look at the Barbary Coast area of San Francisco at the turn of the 20th Century.  The stage numbers are really lavish, sexy, and exciting.  The sets and costumes are very elaborate.  This was really quite a production for its time.  The songs, written specially for the movie, are mostly idiomatic for the time, especially one of them in the second half whose name I can't remember right now.  Of course, one can easily see the '40s shining through in various ways.  Most men have the moustaches favored at the time, though George Raft is bare-faced to appeal to the '40s audience.  Vivian Blaine does a great job singing and acting and should be billed over Joan Bennett, who does a fine job in a far less demanding role.  Peggy Ann Garner, one of the greatest of child actors, is sensitive and convincing as usual.  Although the plot is simple, I really enjoyed how, even though all sorts of rivalry and conflict arise, every character has more than one side.  No one is evil.  George Raft is a tough guy whose sterling character nevertheless shines through his rough exterior.  Several of the characters evince a nobility of spirit.",1409356800,,1263,4.6863636363636365
8532305,4,B008Y1YJKY,"George Raft was often panned for his acting including by his tough guy actor comtemporaries (Bogart, Robinson, etc.), but here he gets a nice role where he is able to balance the tough guy persona with a little heart.  The great Peggy Ann Garner lends a lot as the immigrant girl he is thrust into caring for, but his vulnerability is really exposed by Joan Bennett, as the society dame who leads him into a new world that maybe he wants or maybe he doesn't.  As usual Vivian Blaine lends her lovely voice to some nice tunes and gets a little more glamour treatment here than usual having to go up against Bennett.  All in all a nice movie, not too musical, not too rough and tumble.  For those in the know you will catch that the early scene of the Barbary Coast is shared exactly with ""Hello, Frisco, Hello"", the Alice Faye/John Payne musical.  The story is also similar but focuses more on the stage/music portion of the story.  I recommend both.",1398038400,,949,4.456647398843931
8532306,5,B008Y1YJKY,This a good copy of an old movie that gets on TCM or FMC. Fun to watch the little girl from A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.,1371686400,,117,3.5384615384615383
8532307,4,B008Y1YJKY,"Little disappointed in the colour, considering that the original was in splendid Technicolor;  Some of the 20th Century Fox archive reissues have been very disappointing, so beware.",1356912000,3,181,5.703703703703703
8532308,4,B008Y1YJKY,"I would have given Nob Hill (1945) 4 1/2 stars, but
that's not an option...

I really enjoyed this colorful musical drama starring
George Raft, saloon owner in San Francisco, who's life is
drastically altered by the three women in his life: Joan Bennett,
a wealthy socialite from Nob Hill, Vivian Blaine, star entertainer
at Raft's saloon and young Peggy Ann Garner (special Oscar winner
for A Tree Grows In Brooklyn 1945).

The songs include: I Don't Care Who Knows It, I Walked Right In
With Eyes Wide Open, On San Francisco Bay, What Do You Want To
Make Those Eyes At Me For?, When You Wore A Tulip And I Wore
A Big Red Rose, When Irish Eyes Are Smiling, Hello Ma Baby,
Irish Lullaby and many more.

The dvd quality is excellent with rich and vibrant colors.
If you enjoy films from the 1940s, you will have a very good time
watching Nob Hill. There are no extra features.",1355875200,6,875,4.422360248447205
