5043996,4,B006ZY0PDW,"I normally prefer to review the disc release and not the movie but, obviously, this disc is not yet available and the movie is enough of an unknown quantity (evidenced by this being the first review) that it seemed an exception was due this time.

I came across FORTRESS by accident.  I had not seen any publicity for it and I follow movie releases fairly closely. It is apparently a low budget, independent production.  It is pretty ambitious for such a film.  To recreate the large bomber formations, fighter plane attacks and even the base camp it uses a lot of CGI.

So, I have seen FORTRESS and I very much enjoyed it.  Sure, the visual effects are sometimes a bit crude, but most of the time they are pretty effective and certainly good enough to support the story.  I'd say the visual effects are a bit better than those in the TV series DOGFIGHTS (which were pretty good) but not up to the standards of RED TAILS (a high bar, IMO).  The movie was well written and I was impressed by the performances by the unknown (to me) cast.  For a movie made on a tiny fraction of most big studio movie budgets it is quite an accomplishment.

Synopses of the story can be found on IMDb and if you haven't watched the trailer on YouTube, yet, do so.  If you like WW II movies, especially about the air war in Europe, I think you will like FORTRESS.

I like this movie enough that I have pre-ordered the Blu-ray.  Since Amazon does not mention whether or not it will have any extras, I emailed the production company and asked.  They replied that it will have a timelapse of part of the plane being built and a short documentary.",1339459200,102,1623,4.384615384615385

See, you open them up, (the librarian will show you how,) and inside of them they have PICTURES of UNIFORMS and INSIGNIA. That b.s. about how the only people with any B-17's wouldn't help you?  Again, there's these things called BOOKS, they have them in libraries, and there are LOTS OF THEM about WWII airplanes, in great and glorious and picayune detail. Great Googly Moogly, next time, get ahold of ME why don't you? I have a degree in history with a minor in theatre which means I can help you MAKE THE HISTORICAL DETAILS. What, am I the only one left? I don't think so. I just think this is what happens when people think the internet has all the facts that are available on the planet, and when there's something the wikipedia doesn't know, they just don't know what to do.

As you can see by all the critiques, there's really a lot right with this movie. It's heart is in the right place, the plot is good, the acting is, in my opinion, better than average all the way around. You know, you COULD just tinker around with it some more, fix it in the mix, as it were. If you CGI'd your way into the inaccurate details, hell, you can CGI your way back out of them.

5044006,1,B006ZY0PDW,"Cheesy, low budget production. From the poor writing, to the poor acting, and to the poor special effects, it was just bad. Imagine taking every cliche of every decent WWII movie and putting them all together. That's this movie. Actually, that sounds better than this movie. The flight scenes were also terrible. Maybe if I was playing a video game back in 2012 I'd think the CGI looked good, but for a war movie it was not helping. Not to mention the fact that video games now have better graphics. I feel it brought down the quality of the rest of the film; not that there were many other redeeming qualities. I regret wasting quality time that could have been better spent staring at the wall or watching cars drive down my street. Quality time that I shall never get back. It also saddens me that I can't give lower than a star. I feel this ranking really takes away from better one-star movies. Don't waste your time like I did.

This movie shows among the most realistic ""personalities"" I have seen in a war movie...people are actually people and not trying for ""academy awards"" with ridiculous personalities and other bizarre disorders.  This movie shows the importance of becoming part of a crew and being trusted.  It shows the requirement to rise to leadership from ""Day #1.""

5044035,4,B006ZY0PDW,"Some people thought that the CGI wasn't that good, I disagree, they were actually pretty good.  SPOILER ALERT:  You have to consider all of the interior shots where the camera was looking out of the plane through windows were all CGI as well.  The only thing I thought was pretty far fetched is that the final 3 missions of the film, all had the same story plane, drop out of formation and end up on it's own.  When you think of it, the first mission is the only one where they completed the mission with the formation.  And, none of the CGI, included the cool trailer on Youtube.  Still, the story of the airmen was interesting enough to hold together the film, and I enjoyed the movie in that respect.  I'm just glad that there are a few movies out there about this period and topic.  B17 or any bomber movies equal what 3? 12 oClock High, Mempis Belle and this one, so...it will certainly do, and I will be loading it up along with other war movies on a rainy saturday.",1490572800,2,972,4.302197802197802

I wish these people who do the CGI stuff had  some idea of how airplanes work, I see control movements in some of these movies that would wipe out the plane. Rotary engines that don't rotate, feathered props that aren't working right, and other blatant technical mistakes. Here is just no good reason that these things shouldn't be correct. There is a door behind the gun port on the right side of a B-17, but it's about 3' square. You're not going to stand there and leap out. You have to get down and dive. The interior shots were a bit roomy, but that's pretty typical of any  airplane movie. I have over two hundred fifty aviation moves on DVD, most of them from the prewar and early WWII days.

I am not sure why I am drawn to watching movies and documentary's about the bombers and our service men, that most gave there life. But this was worth my time watching.

5044042,3,B006ZY0PDW,"Clearly low budget. I don't think that is always a bad thing if the writing can make up for it, but it just seemed kind of sappy and cliche for a WW2 film - i.e. unrealistic dialogue that made everyone out to be this big heroic patriot. I think the CGI was pretty bad in some spots, like green screen keying was shaky in some of the layers or mismatched lighting where they layered up one green screened layer on top of another and  shaking that made it obvious that they were separate pieces of footage layered up. They tried to wash out a lot of stuff to cover up flaws or maybe just to save time or both, but it was distracting. Also, there were very obvious gradients in areas like the sky where you could see each step of the gradient banding.  I think if you're going to make a film on a shoestring budget, a story this intensely reliant on CGI is probably the wrong choice.

Unfortunately, that eliminates any interest on the viewer's part as to whether these characters live or die. Why waste your time making a film (or watching a film) if you're not going to create memorable characters?

The images of the computer-rendered planes range from pretty good to laughable. In one scene, a bomber crew is walking along the flightline with their shadows drawn sharply on the ground by the morning sun. But the shadows of the CGI planes parked nearby are fuzzy and nondescript.

The script was apparently written as a bucketful of war cliches. There's a ""secret"" still to nourish the borderline alcoholic servicemen, just like on M*A*S*H. There's a running joke about crew members urinating on a tent peg for good luck. Very random. I'm not sure what that's supposed to symbolize.

The haircuts of the actors are not proper to the time period, and their personalities are closer to now than what one sees in the older movies like 12 O'Clock High and Command Decision. I guess the more modern movies have to appeal to modern audiences, though, or today's audiences would not be able to identify with the characters.  The occasional graphic scenes of the bloodiness and mutilation were not in the older movies, and there is one in the cockpit that is quite startling and left me recalling it all the next day.

5044283,1,B006ZY0PDW,"I love war movies and hold a special affinity for B-17 bomber flicks. This was one of the worst. The plot was thin and focused on what often serves as the underlying story for many a great bomber tail, the pending doom and home sickness of a groundhogs day of death. What sets it apart is that the film focuses on nothing else. I realize that there are supposed to be other themes throughout, but unfortunately they do not stick. The CGI that sets the film apart is as good as it gets. However, there are a few errors that are pretty easy to catch, like a plane landing without a rear wheel, the occasional missing turret gun, etc... The acting is flat and the way the scenes are cut together reminds me of the first Clerks movie, with one important difference, they are not in anyway shape or form funny, even when they try to be.

I believe there are few movies of this type that are epic and stay close to the way it was without over glamorizing a horrible time in the history of the world. This movie made me cry, swell with pride for my fellow Americans, and hurt deeply for the thousand who died. I've bought a few movies for my daughter to watch and I intend to buy this one for her. I think anyone who has never served needs to see what those who did sacrificed. I don't intend anything more than to inform those who have never experienced the fear, dread or absolute panic of war and the courage it takes to overcome these feeling and do what need to be done.

Secondly the military history is so-so. They don't know how to salute. But the malfunctions and the attrition rates were spot on.

Good film.

Imagine if a big time studio got behind a theme like this.

Or like what if a hbo series, like the pacific or band of brothers. That would be so cool",1463702400,,364,4.084507042253521

I can't believe Fortress was created in 2012, the special effects and all of the cinematography (if you can even use that word to refer to it) are so lame.

Many of the battle scenes inside the aircraft looked like it could be in either movie, although Fortress upped the gore level a bit.  Follows the career of a young tee-totaling Lieutenant as he joins a crew of ""Hard-Drinking Irishmen"" just after their beloved Captain was killed in battle, and he is trying to earn his place and their respect.  In the end they accept him and everyone lives happily ever-after (well except for the guys who are shot in combat).

The ""Property"" crew screwed up by not finding or fabricating certain items of uniform, etc.  It was something of a minor shock to see garrison caps with Infantry piping (light blue), instead of Army Air Force dark blue/orange.  I presume that the prop crew took what they could get easily.  The time setting for the film was 1943.  The use of the term ""Air Corps"" was thus jarringly anachronistic, as all operational units of the Army air service were designated ""Air Force"" from June 1941 onward, and thus nobody flew in an ""Air Corps"" unit during the time frame of this movie.  I admit that this ""Air Corps"" usage is found in writings of  people who were not alive and aware during the WWII years, which began, of course, on September 1, 1939.  I have seen it in books that were written well after the war. Story line was second rate; not good writing, in my opinion.

5044818,2,B006ZY0PDW,It is supposed to be based upon a true story but the film version was very unrealistic.  The B-17 formations were never like that. They flew in groups of 4 planes that were stacked in a particular order to provide defense against fighters. The antics of the crew members when on the ground appeared to be far fetched. The equipment used in flight with the B-17 was excellent and the crew stations and interior of the B-17 was  also very realistic.,1453507200,,447,4.506172839506172

5044846,4,B006ZY0PDW,"There are a couple of moments in this otherwise engaging film that the CGI completely (and I mean *THOROUGHLY*) screws the pooch through incredible distortions of scale. And tactics: it would have helped considerably if the producers had hired a military consultant familiar with the ""box formation"" that made the B-17s so deadly to approach, with each tight group of Fortresses protecting not only its own group but nearby groups as well. This movie fills the sky with hundreds of random airplanes, and I do mean ""RANDOM""!! The near-misses and other hair-raising encounters depicted herein are ... well, laughable. But I digress from my main point: SCALE! There are shots where it's painfully obvious that the B-17s are CGI, and the talent is acting on a green stage, and perhaps several layers of this is going on in the background while people are green-screened chatting in the foreground. The background plate is either a live-action or still photo of a B-17 on the ground, and this thing is GINORMOUS!! It's the size of a 747!! The American propaganda image of the B-17 as a giant was true ... IN ITS DAY! It was born of the era in which Amelia Earhart disappeared near Nikumaroro, but it is almost *NEVER* depicted as it truly was: a cramped, freezing, noisy and just-up-to-the-job technological wonder on the cutting edge of reliability. There's a shot of the crew bailing out of a hatch on the starboard side of the airplane, aft of the waist gunner's position. The hatch would fit a 777, the guys standing in the door are standing upright and have headroom. Truth be told, there was no such hatch in a B-17, and the fuselage at the waist gunners' position was scarcely 5' in diameter (not radius ... DIAMETER!) The best description I ever heard from a B-17 vet, a waist gunner, of his place in the airplane in combat, was ""...two guys with jackhammers in a phone booth."" SO: the story is engaging and well-acted, it's wrapped in cheaply researched and poorly done computer graphics with perhaps a few expensive and constantly-repurposed air-to-air shots with a flying B-17 (Commemorative Air Force?) (matted into a single shot 30 times?) but for all its shortcomings, it's a very enjoyable film and if you like flyin' films (""Flight of the Phoenix"" Stewart/Attenborough, ""Flight From Ashiya"", ""Fate Is The Hunter"", ""Twelve O'clock High"", et al) then please let me recommend this film. Oh, one other minor point for the practical and makeup effects guys: blood blackens as it coagulates and dries, even in sub-zero high-altitude conditions. The bright cherry candy red staying bright cherry candy red was another distraction. Didn't *LOVE IT* but have to admit, I liked it a lot. Even watched it again all the way through when I started it and realized, ""Oh, yeah, I saw this one ...""",1451692800,17,2793,4.845188284518828

5044848,1,B006ZY0PDW,"The only reason I gave this film a one star is there is nothing lower. The story is lame at best. The filming was done mostly on video and not one real B-17 was used in the entire film. The flying scenes were done by a geek on a computer. Have you ever seen or heard of a B-17 doing an inside loop? This film has one! No technical advisor in the credits and the film shows it, most all the uniforms are very incorrect, the green color use in the skive shirts was more of a lime green instead of olive drab. This a story about the U.S. Army Air Forces in Africa in mid to late 1942, one of the mechanics is wearing a U. S. Marine Corps cover clearing showing the Marine Eagle, Globe and Anchor. Do not buy this movie and 101% waste of money and time. Semper Fi.",1451174400,4,760,3.973856209150327
5044849,1,B006ZY0PDW,Way too much cussing. I was in the Air Force for 20 years there was more cussing in the first 20 minutes of the movie the I ever herd during my 20 years. Shame on those who made this film. It could have been a great film.,1450828800,2,221,3.723404255319149

5044851,2,B006ZY0PDW,"Based on a true story, is about all the good that came out of this movie. Definitely a B movie, so if you have some time to waste and want to see a war time movie, I guess this would be good to watch. Like another poster mentioned, it is about as good as some of the old war movies from the 50's and 60's, but that is about it. Terrible CGI, mediocre acting, and regular effects like looking out the windscreen and seeing a plane turn to the left, with no arc, and the cabin jostling around like there were a couple of people on the set moving it around by hand, really takes away from the enjoyment. Say what you will about the story, a decent one to tell, but the movie itself really hurt the telling of the story. Wouldn't recommend.",1450310400,,736,4.118055555555555
5044852,1,B006ZY0PDW,"Technically, historically, and visually inaccurate. It was sad when the crew got the news from the pilot the engine hydraulics where shot out? I am certain A B-17 engine, like most vehicles with an engine, have oil in them not transmission fluid. However, the aircraft hydraulics where later reported shot out despite everything on the plane hydraulic controlled clearly working fine. The bombardier asked the pilot to keep the plane steady so he could hit the target. The bombsite in a B-17 required the bombardier to operate the plane on the last few miles to target. The CC translation was comical and obviously done by outsourced near English speakers. The plane gets lost in heavy clouds as the copilot forgot to use instruments while flying in the ""suit"". One of the gunners gets hit in the ""truck"" and so on. I hoped he had insurance. A American P-40 out climbs a BF-109 who is shooting at him from 200 ft for 3-4 minutes without a hit. When the 109 stalls the p-40 flips on his tail and kills it with a two second burst. How hard is it to do a detailed CGI model of one B-17 and copy it for formation scenes? Apparently harder than a 2012 flight sim from Ubisoft that has way better looks that these low level graphical sprites. The people who watch these movies are well versed in the facts surrounding them as often they are critical to the drama. This made for $2.00 DVD bin fiasco was a waste of the ten minutes I could tolerate. Like many WW2 items on prime they are non watchable web space fillers.",1450224000,,1512,4.501818181818182

I also was in the US Army as a Canoneer on a 155 MM towed howitzer, then on M-47 and M-48 tanks, between 1957-1964. The drinking, gambling and porn were everywhere. Yes, even in the 50's and 60's.

Germans only show up as ME-109s that make passes, shoot up heros and get shot down. Story ends where it begins, new people replace the old casualties on a plane that doesn't get to target a few times but finally drops bombs in anger and ends up crashing in the end with some surviving and some not.

5045095,2,B006ZY0PDW,"Cheesey, heavy-handed. Awful,constant mood music during most of the dialog, during most of the scenes of the movie - many, many variations on ""Auld Lang Syne"". Apparently when WWII Bomber crews danced in their down time, all they had available to them were traditional jigs and reels. For me, there were only two redeeming scenes in the movie. A young pilot goes the extra mile, working with the chief mechanic to solve a problem with his crew's plane. Later, the same pilot bails out one of his crewmates when trouble is imminent. I could go on and on about the hideous CGI ""flyovers"" of the camp, the abundance of hackneyed 1940's stereotypes, and the total lack of depth of the characters ... but if you really want a first hand experience and have most of two hours to lose and never get back, you could watch it.

The drinking ... yes ... drinking is a major activity after ""work"". We were lucky to get one movie a month, if then.  Like in this movie, the stress rode high on everyone's shoulders, from the top to the bottom of the ranks. Once in a great while, the C.O. would come out to the flight line and try to ""lighten"" things up, with a beer party, especially after working one or two weeks in a row, with only three hours sleep, between having to get the birds flying again. Anyway ... I felt a close kinship with the crews and people portrayed.  Overall ... a darned good movie.",1443657600,,748,4.223776223776224
5045099,5,B006ZY0PDW,This was a great story based on ACTUAL events. Obviously we have become jaded when a story is judged by the quality of the graphics. It wasn't meant to be a video game.

Characters are believable, and although my experience is limited to Vietnam, I take no issue with behaviors and mostly agree that it would represent actual air crews then. CGI and some of the ""flying"" were a bit over the top in places but overall it was measured and accurate enough for armchair historians.  One reasonably versed in WWII aircraft will need to ignore inaccuracies regarding aircraft models vs. dates as well as some armament.  Footage inside the B-17 was very well done.  I am a private pilot and have flown in a B-17 (yeah, I know, big wow. No offense to the guys that really flew in them during WWII. Thank you!).  I will assume the film's military advisor(s) were very good.  Unlike most movies, I'll probably watch this one again.  The Irish music was getting a bit tedious and repetitive.

5045136,4,B006ZY0PDW,"Well, it's a plain fact that the German 20 mm cannon was hell on door gunners and crewmembers. It was pure butchery, plain and simple. The air war boiled down to a race to the bottom of German replacements and fuel. As the war burned on, German boys weren't any match for American fighter pilots. This movie really makes it clear that luck was a major factor in survival. Never knew about the ethanol in the fuel. American bomber crews were actually under a death sentence. The odds of completing 25 successful missions was so close to impossible as to be sickening.

What most people don't realize is just how young those bomber crews really were. 18-20 years old, and the Officers were a couple of years older. The bombers were literally sitting ducks. It was very difficult to hit a fighter flying almost 400 mph. No real armor to speak off, and flak and 20 mm cannon shells went thru whatever was hit. Most shot up crewmen bled to death in 30 below zero. So, Fortress is a good movie, just understand what you're seeing.",1442275200,2,1024,4.505376344086022

""Husky"" is mentioned in passing, but never explained (a major pre-Normandy invasion of the island by Canadian forces, mainly, supported by, Brits and GIs.)  Historical Note: the invasion was a hell of a lot more successful than the bombing missions, which, according to the movie, took out 8 of 10 men in the bombers.

Great stuff...but this movie doesn't do any of it justice, and the aerial combat between what look like Mustangs and MI-109s (Hey; where'd the Fortress go?) start to resemble video games.  Too much shine and sheen, not enough grit and guts.",1442102400,,785,4.693430656934306

The story is based on a true story, and I haven't researched this particular case to see how much it sticks to the real story, but I have always been a history buff.

The characters seemed rather exaggerated, but not terribly so; though it felt like a group of California boys trying to sound like a veteran B-17 crew from 70 years ago.  Blame that one on the writers and the director.  Seriously guys, if you're going to make a period film, study the period.  And, while you're out shopping for a dialect coach, movement coach, and voice coach, see if you can find a smoking coach.  Really; non-smokers who are trying to look like they habitually smoke come off looking clumsy at best; and 70 years ago, nearly all men (and very few women) smoked.

I was particularly impressed by the CGI of the B-17 bombers.  More than 19,000 of those aircraft were built, but today the only way to find a real one that can fly is to build it from scratch.  One silly tip that I didn't even think about until I started writing a review:  Aluminum airplane wings flex in flight; just a little, but it would have been enough to notice in the external close-up flying scenes.",1441670400,,1225,4.468468468468468

I say this not from the technical aspects of the movie but the comradery that a crew has to have to be able to fly, fight and survive in battle. The movie showed that so very well. The booze was shown because aircrews use it to cover the grief they don't have time to experience since they have to get up the next day and do the job all over again never knowing when it could be their last mission.
 I can speak from experience as a combat assault helicopter pilot with the 1st Cav Division in Vietnam. In combat there is no time to grieve the loss of those who didn't make it. We had to rationalize why we survived and they didn't. It causes a lot of guilt that we never get away from.

5045303,4,B006ZY0PDW,"This was a pretty decent movie about a crew of a B-17 bomber in WWII. I liked it because it showed the seldom-seen Italian front from the air war side. Most of these movies depict the Western front while this one was about Africa and Italy. I found the situations and actor's behavior to be realistic and representative of the times. I do have sympathy with those people who took issue with all of the F-bombs, but for good or bad, it was a realistic representation of how these crews talked. I for one am not going to apply our 21st century PC glasses to condemn the generation who saved all of us from ourselves. One scene I particularly enjoyed occurred when the new co-pilot was doing everything he could to keep one of the enlisted men from facing a court martial. His concocted story where he received the blame got the man off the hook while amusing the base CO at the same time. I could see this happening at a time when the commander needed every available man to send on missions. The last thing he needed was a crewmember in the brig just to satisfy a junior officer's vanity. All in all, this was a very enjoyable way to spend an evening.",1438214400,,1150,4.3534883720930235

5045473,5,B006ZY0PDW,"I was born in the closing weeks of WW II so there was zero chance I could do my part although my parents did theirs.  But all my life I have felt a certain guilt that I was not able to do something to contribute to that epic battle to literally save the world for Democracy.

The men and women who lived through, and fought that noble fight and those that never made it ""home"" deserve our ever lasting gratitude and eternal respect.

They were, and will always remain, for me and for so any others: ""The Greatest Generation""

I try to watch every film, that like FORTRESS, makes us pause and think how I would have withstood the non stop horror, the constant fear, the continuous awareness , 24/7, that maybe today or tomorrow or next week, my luck will run out and I also will just become another statistic, returning home in a Flag Draped coffin.

In the very opening of the film one reads a brief text that the men we are about to ""meet"" in this film belonged to Divisions where you had to complete a minimum of 25 successful bombing missions before you could be relieved from further future flying missions.  And this statement was followed with the words that only 2 out of every 25 flying groups ever survived long enough to complete their required 25 bombing runs to be relieved from those Divisions.

Those are pretty thin odds.  And how many of those brave flyers did make it home but without arms, legs, faces and/or their eyesight to gaze once more on those they loved and had left behind.

Those who give a film like this less than 4 or 5 Stars,  because the film had a limited budget that did not allow for all the Hollywood glitz and special effects one encounters in a 10 or 20 Million dollar Mega production miss the whole point of the film.

And likely such ""film critics"" were not there, did not serve, do not have the faintest clue as to what it was like to be there at that time in history.

I grew up around such people who were there, in those planes, who were among those who were part of the waves of soldiers who stormed the beaches of Normandy, literally forced to run into the onslaught of German machine gun fire as soon as they stepped on the beach.

How many of those brave men were simply cut down the moment their boots touched the sand, cut down in the prime of their life.

Some may say that the negative critics here are simply rating the film according to their personal expectations of what a film must contain and achieve to be considered a 5 Star film.

Well, good for them for being so demanding and so ""discriminating"".  And how admirable that they have the boundless ""courage"" to turn off and stop watching a film that does not cut it for them and/or make the grade according to their lofty expectations.

I wonder just how courageous such demanding critics would have been if asked to board one of the bombers we see in this film and fly every single day into the Jaws of Hell.

For me personally I want a movie to envelope me with its story and its message and make me think and feel and be moved and remember all the characters and their faces and their dreams and yes- their ultimate Sacrifices freely made for the sake of Humanity.

I do not need to watch a 40 million dollar ""Star Wars"" type spectacle to feel I did not waste my money or two precious hours of my life, which I can never replace.

When I view a film I hope it will make me think about life, about what others have done and sacrificed, before me, to make this a better world for those who follow.

And FORTRESS achieves that in Spades.

And for the record, those who gave this powerful movie just 1 or 2 Stars- that's probably 1 or 2 Stars more than such people would have ever received in the Military- if such people had ever served in the Military in the first place to protect the Nation in which they lived.

Bravo and bravo encore to the Director, the Writer, the Producers, the Actors and all who took part in bringing FORTRESS to fruition.  It is a Film which will endure for generations to come.",1434240000,13,4017,4.318242343541944
5045474,1,B006ZY0PDW,"This ranks up there as one of the worst war movies I have ever seen.  Cheesy animation of inflight scenes and on the flightline were laughable. There were so many basic errors in the production that anyone with basic knowledge of a bomber or any airplane for that matter would be annoyed by the lack of respect the producer had for making it right. To list just a few...  A flight instrument is not ""caged"" in flight, a pilot doesn't hold the aircraft steady in a bombing run, unless you are lead in a formation you don't initiate a turn in formation on your own, a copilot doesn't become a captain just because the pilot dies in a previous mission, a aircrew flying drunk is not likely.

Yet the acting insufficiency might be overlooked if not for the technical insufficiency that of being a generally poor sound recording. In the case of this movie sound is very important. Fortress is a dialogue dependent movie. Unable to understand what is being said limits the movie's potential impact on the viewer. With some hearing limitations of my own, I was unable to fully comprehend reasons for the presence of tension between characters. Unfortunately the close caption of this particular movie is hardly near to being synchronized with its visual events. This resulted in an unpleasant viewing experience, And that is surprising, for more often than not I enjoy cinematic portrayals of a WW 2 events.

5045576,3,B006ZY0PDW,"where to begin...

The flight scenes are obviously 3D renders, and not top notch ones either, even for 2012. They look slightly- slightly- better than my IL2 Sturmovik PC game jacked up to full.

Now, I'm a B-17 junkie and have been my whole remembered life. The stories, the pictures, the footage, the museums, I've seen it all. If you're a B-17 junkie too, this movie is a ""must see"" but don't expect a ""Memphis Belle."" Nothing can compare to actual B-17's flying. That being said, the story was different than the ""typical"" heavy bomber movie based in England and making runs over Germany. The base in Libya and flights to Italy/Sicily are a nice change.

The character story is tenuous at best though. A crew of all Irish Americans, who make every effort to make Irish jokes and stay drunk all the time? It was rare to have a crew all from a certain area, although I suppose it could happen. The crew are always hung over and again, while I'm certain this happened on occasion, a whole crew of alcoholics wouldn't have survived many missions.

**SPOILERS**

The new co-pilot arrives and is understandably concerned about the behavior of his new crew. His good judge in character is short lived as he folds and begins to adapt to the new crew, instead of requesting a transfer or filing a report.

However, the flight segments are pretty good once you get past the graphics. The action portion of the story is filled with the horrors of aerial combat, although the apparent ""green"" status of the crew shows itself here, too.

In closing, there are movies made about ""crack"" bomber crews, but there are very few that show the horrors that accompany being ""ate up"" and this movie seems to cover that, albeit unintentionally. When you read about crews that just didn't cut it, you wind up with a story like this.",1430697600,3,1812,4.626168224299065

Unless I am mistaken, the intention of the movie was not to be the greatest military action movie made, but it was about the human element of war.  Although they were not airmen, my grandparents/great-uncles served as infantry men and paratroopers during WW2.  They never talked about it.  I am thankful movies like this that give an insight into the service, sacrifice, and life of the military men of that era. How did they cope and continue you serving?  Fortress helped to increase my appreciation even more for the past and current military.  Thank you.",1429401600,,810,4.875912408759124

  Fortress surprised me in the best possible way.  From the riviting opening scene. To the very accurate portrayal of the daily lives of the young men from very different walks of life.  It pulled no punches. I'd watch it again and when I can no longer watch it on amazon prime I would probably purchase it.

One of my father's buddies watched it and told me it is the best B17 movie he ever saw. He should know; he lost three of them, two made it back to England and were written off for parts.

That era is ripe for so many more good stories that should be made into movies. So what if it is similar?

5045761,5,B006ZY0PDW,"Fortress is one of those really good movies that slip through the cracks somehow.  Based on true accounts during World War II, Fortress follows the crew of Lucky Lass, a B-17 Flying Fortress.

Having been a crewmember in aircraft a good deal of my career, the producers, director and actors definitely got the camaraderie part right.  You're either a crew or you aren't.  In times of war (or other high stress non-wartimes), that closeness is what gets a crew through even the worst of times.

What I really did appreciate was that the producers took the time to let people know at the end of the movie, they could not possibly duplicate the aircraft faithfully and a few other things.  In fact, what they put out was pretty darn funny.

Fortress is a good movie.  There's laughter, tears, scary moments and goofiness.  There's even the typical ""Zero"" (officer) who thinks his job is to make sure nobody steps out of line.  There's a time and a place for that kind of overseeing.  The Skipper seemed to know it was BS.

Fortress is worth watching.  If you like historical movies - it's worthwhile.  If you like movies of friendship - it's worthwhile.  If you like airplane movies and I don't mean the movie Airplane, although that's another story - it's worthwhile.",1419206400,5,1265,4.6863636363636365

The bomber just looked all wrong, especially the waist gunner openings (too large), too short nose.  In one scene, the B-17 is landing and the tail wheel is still retracted.  I also thought the ball turret had to be retracted on take off and landings.  I would say, the end of the movie, was better than the first hour or so.

Tears and laughter kind of live in the same bed during a war. Tempers and lives are quick to come and go.
Fortress is a glimpse into the World of the young men of the USAAF. Attrition was about 2%...and a guy had to fly 25 missions before he could go home. That meant that your life was literally a coin toss.....50%...the odds of you living (or dying) were 50%.

I did not even watch the last 20 minutes.  Another thing that really bothered me was that the waist gunners 50 cals were blatantly dummy guns.  They didn't even have charging handles!!!

5045795,5,B006ZY0PDW,"I bought Fortress on the recommendation of a friend, and from the very first moment I was hooked!  Starring Bug Hall, Donnie Jeffcoat, Sean McGowan, and Manu Intiraymi, this movie tells the story of a B-17 bomber crew who, after losing their original commander in a raid over Sicily, find themselves having to deal with breaking in the replacement, a young pilot who has no clue how to fit in, and who seems to do everything wrong at first, alienating the men he's supposed to be commanding.

The thing I loved most about this film is the acting.  The stars bring a freshness and vitality to the story that seems to be lacking in most big-budget Hollywood war epics, and they are the best and brightest of today's crop of young actors.  I definitely hope to see more from this bunch!

The story was very good as well.  Some of the pranks that the Lucky Lass's crew pulled on their new commander (and each other) brought to mind some of the stories I used to hear from my father about his service in the Navy Seabees, and I spent a good amount of time watching Fortress and being just plain awestruck at how real the Lucky Lass and her crew felt to me because of the things they would do.

This film shows us a different and previously neglected look at the campaign in north Africa in 1943 against Axis targets in the Mediteranean theater, It is also different in showing ethnic tensions between members of a combat crew instead of the usual idealised image of a melting pot of every American economic, regional, religious and immigrant stock. The B-17s themselves are computer generated but the generation is for once done so well that it is sometimes possible to forget that it is being done. It is not the same as actually watching historic combat footage or a survivor B-17 that can actually fly. But it was a pleasant surprise to view this movie.

I will only make two observations: #1 - I agree the acting, CGI, and dialogue wasn't the greatest, but overall I liked the film. While not real accurate historically, it ranks right up there with many of the higher budget WW2 films of years past as it was entertaining overall. I am glad I bought it. #2 - Am I the only one who purchased a DVD that had no sub-titles ( I really love having sub-titles)? I have a 7.1 surround system and the sound was so terrible all I could hear were loud sound effects and muffled voices until I switched it to the DVD's ""stereo"" option from the DTS. If I am the only one with these problems I will try and purchase another one. Maybe the Blu-ray version will fix this?

Bug Hall and Chris Owen are exceptional, as is Donnie Jeffcoat, Sean McGowan and Manu Intiraymi. These guys make up part of the crew of a B-17 ""Flying Fortress"". The CGIs were done very well and are highly believable. Anyway, the action takes place in the sky. The B-17s opperate from an airbase built in the desert in Algiers. These ""birds"" are sent to pummel the ""Krauts"" in Italy. Lt. Michael Schmidt (Bug Hall) is sent to replace ""Pops"" who was killed in action. He must prove himself being worthy in battle, to gain the necessary respect from his crew he needs in order to be accepted as one of the ""Lucky Lass'"" wayward Irish sons.

BUT, I made the mistake of watching the extras on the DVD before I watched the film.  Not that it gave the plot away, but I saw the shortcuts they had to take to make it on a limited budget.  Then I looked for flaws instead of just watching.  If you know as much as I do about B-17s and the way missions were flown, you'll pick the film apart.  It is not a big bucks movie and as the credits state, it was a labor of love.  It is not 12 O-clock High.  If it wasn't for the music and the name on the plane, you'd never know the crew was suppose to be Irish.
Speaking of credits, watch the credits until the end.  It will help you to understand what they did do and couldn't do.
With all of that said, it was a good film and I'm glad I watched it.  The last mission was well done and made it all worth watching.",1366416000,3,997,3.87192118226601
5045803,1,B006ZY0PDW,"I thought the story was fantastic, with its usual portrayal of courage and difficulties faced by our servicemen in war. Indeed the acting could be better but let us not forget that most of the actors are in the early phase of their careers. I commend their efforts.

However the CGI graphics was a huge disappointment and inexcusable in my opinion. Indeed budget plays a part in any motion picture but graphics which are downright poor and last-generation game quality? If they had focused effort on near-field graphics (eg graphics of the subject B17) by shifting time and resource from background graphics, the overall quality would have been better and perhaps acceptable. As it is, the word 'pathetic' comes immediately to mind.

The CGI quality was a huge insult to the efforts of the actors.

My preferred movie genre is War, specifically WW2. And without exaggeration, I have seen the majority of WW2 movies made between 1945 and the present day. I cannot recall ever feeling this disappointed about a WW2 movie. Pre-HD era movies can be excused for poorer graphics as technology did not exist back then. But this is 2012!

1) Acting-  Horrible, even given the fact that it was populated
  by ""c"" list actors.

2) Realism- Non-existant!!  The aircraft were all (very obviously)
  computer graphics...including the long shots of the air
  base.  It was as if this was a High School production
  of ""Memphis Belle"" using student actors and sets that would
  fit on the stage of a High School auditorium!

3) Other-  The premise, i.e., an Irish crew that drinks constantly,gets
  roaring drunk (both officers and enlisted men together) and
  flies missions into Italy the next day, is
  preposterous...and I haven't even mentioned the ""still""
  where they make their own booze right under the nose
  of the commanding officers. I could go on and on, as where
  they take a (computer graphic) B-17 up to about 30,000 feet
  After they lose TWO engines, etc., etc.

5045816,4,B006ZY0PDW,"I too saw this movie at the store so I picked it since I collect WWII movies.  I'll try to break this review down into several things.

The actors did an okay job.  Remember that most air crews, especially replacements, in WWII were very young.  If you were 25 years old you were considered an ""old man"".  The crews in this movie are a lot younger than say those in Memphis Belle which gives it some credability.  Remember our grandfathers were just young kids barely out of high school who fought WWII.  There were not 40 year old Hollywood A list actors like in Saving Private Ryan.

A few people have ccomplained about the drinking in the film.  Again, having served myself in the Army in the GWOT, I think the drinking is right on.  Everyone deals with things in their own way.  For many they turn to alcohol.

As far as no threat or fear, obviously the other reviewer has not done any history research about the air crews in WWII.  The threat of death that ground troops faced 24/7 did not impact the air crews.  While they did go into danger during bombing runs and suffer heavy casualties, they were able to retreat to safety between the missions.  You don't sit there worrying about getting killed, you block it out.  In other words you ddon't want to think about it so you do anything not to.  Ground troops didn't have this option.

As far as CGI and things looking fake, what ""looks"" real?  Even Redtails that had a budget in the millions used CGI.  Even Memphis Belle used toy models for many of the damage sequences.  If you pay attention to the story line you can easily overlook the few CGI errors.  In fact most of it looked pretty good considering the low budget.

The argument that one reviewer tried to make that the sounds were wrong is pointless.  If ANY movie sounded like it realy did up there you would not b able to hear anything except engine noise.  I have been around many warbirds and the sound is deafening.  Remember the 1940s was a time before OSHA required earplugs.  This is no different than any military movie where the soldiers are firing guns.  My ears would ring firing an M16 let alone what air crews heard firing ten 50 cals per B17.

Overall this is a good movie with a nice story line.  The lack of super big name A list actors makes it more believable.  If you love B17s you will enjoy this movie.  The fact that story takes place focusing on the Italy raids is a nice change from all the focus of raids on France and Germany.  And a B17 base somewhere other than England is a nice change also.  I highly recommend this movie.",1355011200,136,2570,4.375

This sort of hits the mark... It's aircraft are very well done as far as the FX go, but the acting is second rate...maybe third rate in some respects. But I bought it not for the acting but for the aircraft, and hear it shines. Yes there are problems with the FX aircraft and the B-17 set is off a bit...But who cares...It'll still bring a tear to your eye.

Aerial combat is perhaps the most easily glamorized aspect of warfare, and this film effectively shows just how ""glamorous"" it was to be a crew member on a WWII bomber.

Many of the scenes shot inside the B-17 hark back to the days of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midway/dp/B002A9VIZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midway</a>; i.e., the plane is obviously not actually flying. Still, the outside shots of the bombing missions and duels with German fighters are quite arresting in places, usually without the animation being too obvious.

We're convincingly shown a great many technical details of WWII bomber flying here, and the way FORTRESS combines the gritty realism of today's war films with some of the endearingly corny plot elements of older films works quite well.

The biggest weakness is that the central characters are rather flat and under-developed. Admittedly, it would be hard to reveal the personalities of all 10 crew members in any detail without becoming ponderous, but something more in the way of human interest would help here.",1353110400,3,1691,7.53030303030303

Although, aside from Chris Owen (the Shermanator from American Pie goes airforce grunt), I did not recognize any of the actors in the film but I found their performances both strong and understated which helped me connect to the characters they portrayed.

I laughed, I cried, yes..the type of crying where I needed Kleenex, I held tight to a pillow during the fight scenes.  It tapped into all my emotions.  This movie was worth watching.

5045834,1,B006ZY0PDW,"The saddest part of this film is the CGI.  The filmmakers obviously had no funding to do things right, so they turned this into a video game with live actors.  The actors were bad but I suspect that was more because the script was so bad.  I can't believe it got any funding at all.

There are no transitions, and the conflict is absent too.  Nothing makes sense and there is no sense of impending danger despite the fact that these are pilots in the Eighth Air Force and more likely to die than soldiers landing on the beaches at Normandy.  The film is supposed to be about the bombing raids on Rome but there's no build up, nothing to foreshadow what lies ahead.

The story idea is great, but it stays an idea and nothing more.  I love any and all WWII films and I usually just buy them straight off, but this time I happened to see it at Redbox and so I rented it for $1.20.  So glad I did.

Save your money.  When Steven Spielberg gets around to the American bombing raid on Rome, then you can buy the DVD.  Sadly, this isn't it.",1346198400,5,1033,4.161616161616162

I am not a nitpicker for accuracy, I don't expect every movie to be Academy Award caliber, movies are for entertainment plain and simple, I was entertained. The CGI was very good, detail was good, and for being unknowns, I thought the actors did a pretty good job. What I liked most about the movie was the camaraderie displayed between the crew. It was 100% percent accurate.  Having served in submarines for 20 years, I know what it means to be a crew. I went through the hazing, the drinking, the fear, practical jokes, sacrifice, just like in this movie. I was very pleased with the memories it brought back to me. I guarantee, the majority, if not all negative reviews are from people who never served in uniform, or ones who expect everything to be 100% perfect.

BTW, the same CG company that worked on ""Red Tails"" did the CG work for ""Fortress"" and the original music was written by  multiple award winner, Chris Ward!

Not just the quality of the story, which I found to be well-paced and emotionally moving, but also the quality of the film, itself.  There were certainly a few points where I was pulled from the story by CGI shots that felt haphazardly thrown in, but these moments were few and far between.

5045840,4,B006ZY0PDW,"For a low budget indie film, I was actually quite surprised with this little flick. The story played well, and although I didn't recognize any of the actors, they did a good job. That said, the movie did have some minor issues:  The use of 1940's slang in the dialogue was a bit odd for me - it felt a little forced at times - and I did feel the second half dragged a bit.  But, I will say, it definitely came together at the end.  Also, the quality of the visual effects wasn't always consistent.  But, all and all (and for an indie film), I was surprised at the number of good quality CG shots.  They weren't up to snuff with movies like ""Red Tails"" or ""John Carter,"" but these guys were clearly working with a different budget, entirely.

In general, I can definitely say this is not your typical low budget film. The filmmakers were obviously very ambitious and did a lot with what was probably a shoe string budget, and they were able to do it without substantially detracting from the story.
