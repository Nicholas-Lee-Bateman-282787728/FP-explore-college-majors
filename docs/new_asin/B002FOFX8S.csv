3923473,2,B002FOFX8S,"Set to the voice of a whispering John Cusack, and an overly emotional score,  ""Besieged Fortress"" uses ""macro-photography"" to tell the story of ants versus termites. I'm not sure if there's a pretense that the movie is any kind of documentary, I don't think there is, but the emotion and anxiety that the film tries to produce, for me, was way too contrived.

If I'm wrong, to the filmmakers, I apologize - but watching this movie I could almost see animal trainers dropping insects, and other animals, in the frame to add to storyline (isn't that what Marlon Perkins was accused of?). It also looked like a fair amount of CGI had been used in some of the shots, but who am I to say.

I guess ultimately someone said, ""Hey, we can get great shots of insects close-up, but we're not making a documentary, so who's got a story?""

With made-to-order sound effects, emotionally overbearing music and blatantly planted scenarios it would require a huge amount of intellectual dishonesty for this movie to do anything but make you regret you didn't rent or buy a real documentary.

Will most feel the same way? Maybe not, just don't expect to see a smart documentary. The footage is interesting at least.",1255219200,4,1198,4.685714285714286

8369294,4,B002FOFX8S,"Not sure how accurate this movie was. Parts of it seemed staged, that it, artificial. I learned only two facts. Females termites lay 30,000 eggs per day, and driver ants have 10 million (I think) members in their colony. But, a great movie.",1398556800,,240,4.604651162790698
8369295,3,B002FOFX8S,"Fact-based perhaps, but not a documentary.  The real-life ""actors"" play themselves as the film makers contrive all sorts of situations to keep the action going.  The production team seems to have channeled their preteen boyhood selves in the making of this movie, subjecting their film subjects to all kinds of disasters.  Officially rated G, but I would consider it PG based on massive Bug Violence, mild discussions of Bug Sex, and the hair-raising views of the freaky Termite Queen.  Amazing bug videography.",1388361600,,511,5.195121951219512
8369296,5,B002FOFX8S,"This is a top of the line documentary unlike any other documentary I have ever seen and I have seen many documentaries but hardly any, and I really mean hardy any in regard to DRIVER ants which are continuously on the move in huge numbers and bring down cattle without any hesitation at all. No stupid loud music, no distraction of any sort, this is the Oscars of nature documentaries. You could not even write a script for two different creatures and pull it off like this director has. Absolutely unbelievable, entertaining, educational, gripping story with cast of powerful, out of this world actors who never read the script or got paid for their acting. No creature can match the ferocious gorilla DRIVER ANTS, a blind carnivores, coordinating and communicating with chemicals and signals without a fixed home, with colonies of 20 million sterile ants, only a single queen laying some 100,000 eggs a day. Termites with a single queen laying some 30,000 eggs live in a fixed nest where they only consume wood which is processed for consumption by the mushroom that queen carried on her back to her bridal chamber. I have seen few ant colonies in the nature (not in millions since you only see that in Africa) where it was truly impossible to even walk anywhere close in their path and having anyone to document these two different creatures as well as enemies in millions, all the way down to queen's bridal chamber especially with DRIVER ants with so many high quality shots from so many different angles is truly beyond me. Absolutely positively unbelievable masterpiece production. Bravo, bravo, Bravo.",1375660800,,1609,4.875912408759124
8369297,5,B002FOFX8S,"I don't know what it is but from a very young person I always felt innately that there was a way to see and understand insects. All those years I never quite found an example of this specifically in the realm of film and documentary. There is BBC, Nova, Discovery Channel, PBS, Wild Kingdom, National Geographic and the list goes on and on. The problem is after numerous viewed documentaries there is a point at which perception and large scale vision are absent. In other words one can watch a movie about whales and really come away without getting the clear picture of the whales size and proportion or perhaps the depths they swim wasn't fully explored or even shown in clarity.
What has happened in the past is many wildlife documentaries just were not up to par nor was technology.

Besieged Fortress is an example of a documenary that does everything required and then some. When I recieved the film it went into my DVD Player and stayed in the player a full 24 hours atleast playing over and over.
At any rate, the documentary was effective with imagery and clarity succeding to reveal impossible underground footage inside the termite mounds or citadels even here the camera work was unrelenting and often complimented with appropriately timed background music some reminiscent of the movie Alien with Sigourney Weaver. The music was succesful on its own at capturing and conjuring up a concise mood for the varying scenes of queen, workers etc. Mostly little was missed about the termite colony's structures and members.
The only thing that was perhaps odd was the fact that I couldn't get a clear idea of just how big these individual termites of Africa were much less the Driver Ant colony featured as well. It was my belief that the driver ants were in the size range of domestic army ants such as Carpenter or Harvester species perhaps even a little larger but the termite soldiers were seen to be larger in size then the ant soldiers does this mean these tropical termites are perhaps 3/4 inch or larger?? all this time I had thought a termite was only a few millimeters in size.  That would be great and a little known fact had they been n inch or larger.
Regardless, it was more ideal in that ""Besieged"" protrayed the termites on a scale that would approach science fiction. It was a film that combined the fictional genius perhaps of Orson Wells or Jules Verne and the accuracy of perhaps National Geographic into one composite whole. It was something I never observed exactly before and it was the fullfilling of a long lost piece to a puzzle.
On another note, I kept wondering about the narrator as he seemed so far from the range of story telling for this type of film sounding more like an employee of ASPCA or simply not aligned to the details of this transformed micro universe. At any rate, I think had it been narrated by a more austere, intense or older person the documentary could have been accommodated much better.",1331769600,2,2945,4.661538461538462
8369298,5,B002FOFX8S,"Without this movie, we would never have known what goes on inside a termite den or witness the social networking of ants and termites. The egg laying was incredible! Our family loved it, and if you have tough young people who collect nasty bugs this may be just what they'd like to see.  The movie was gross or gory in places and remarkable in others, but that's the way insects are.  I, for one, was happy to break away from the narrative pattern and conclusions of David Attenborough. The dramatic music and narration was a welcome change.",1327536000,,541,4.56701030927835
8369299,1,B002FOFX8S,"Some decent macro photography all set to an insanely dramatic soundtrack and completely monotone whispered narration of an overly emotional and deeply dishonest script. Cusack is quite possibly the worst narrator on the planet. He must have driven the sound engineers batty.

In comparison to the brilliant, factual, and informative documentaries such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-in-the-Undergrowth/dp/B000EBD9W6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life in the Undergrowth</a>, this doesn't play well.

Lots and lots of insects were deliberately destroyed for the making of this thing because there's just no way the camera crew just happened to be there when the assorted disasters struck unless they caused them. I know they're just bugs. But it's still not nice.",1266364800,,811,6.431192660550459
8369300,5,B002FOFX8S,"Yo straight-up, this is the greatest bugumentary ever made!  There are all kinds of crazy camera angles inside this teeming megalopolis of seething insecticism, and at its horripilated core the heaving mass of the queen daily pumps out 30 000 drone-clones to feed the maw of evolution's fangs and claws.  Weird purplish lights glint and glimmer inside the queen's body as the war drums that are the abdomens of weaver ants beat against quaking leaves and finally summon ant armageddon.  A terrific battle ensues under lightning and rain, and the resultant walls of mud finally carry the dying, damned, and doomed down into the dark recesses of a dirt-and-spit labyrinth.  John Cusack's narration is pitch perfect over top of the deathmatch, neither under- nor overstated as the micro is translated into the macro.",1260403200,5,813,5.090225563909774
8369301,4,B002FOFX8S,"If you like watching Discovery channel, this is right up your alley.  Definitely too drawn out in certain parts and probably longer than it needs to be but awesome all the same.  Who knew that Termites were an advanced society?  Kinda joking, but it's seriously amazing.  I know one of the other reviews said something about CG, but I think they just sped up some parts and played with lighting effects.  After all, if you go stake out a termite nest for 2 years your going to have some crazy wild life epic-ness occur.  It's not Hollywood type of drama, it's 'penguins' type of drama.  Expect dramatized documentary.  Ta da.",1257206400,3,625,4.618181818181818
8369302,5,B002FOFX8S,"The macro photography of the termites, ants, and a few other insects is stunning.  I found the action of the insects fighting to be more dramatic than most of the action films I've seen recently.  If you are looking for a very entertaining movie about insects, here it is.",1256428800,2,272,4.530612244897959
