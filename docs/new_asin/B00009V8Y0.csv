8387333,5,B00009V8Y0,"Chronologically following their ""mirrored"" real life TV show (which is also great!) Seeing Double provides that quirk of Miami 7 (lightning bolt when they put their hands in together) with the more mature developments in their music as a band started to write more material and take direction of a more mature sound. The plot is cheesy- it's pop- like Spiceworld. It isn't mean to be something that blows your mind or creates a piece of fine art; it's a feel good movie with a ton of laughs that aren't bubblegum influenced. It dips into science fiction but ultimately highlights what S Club was about: fun, music, dancing, and friendship. It features songs off the album of the same name, but the musical highlights are:

- Do It Till We Drop
- Whole Lotta Nothin'
- Don't Stop Movin'
- Love Ain't Gonna Wait For You
- Dance
- Never Had A Dream Come True
- Who Do You Think You Are?

Not only do the members pull of acting the parts- their genuine characters make it great and the dynamic they display between each individual to another is great for a short movie. You get their personalities even if you aren't familiar. Hannah, Rachel, Jon, Bradley, Tina and Jo really put on a great movie for only having 3 weeks to film on top of other band commitments.",1506556800,,1258,4.489082969432315
