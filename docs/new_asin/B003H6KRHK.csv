8396733,3,B003H6KRHK,"The movie felt pretty different from the series. I guess I had great expectations going in because a friend of mine compared it to such terrifically emotional animes such as Clannad, Kanon, and Rumbling Hearts. There was plenty of drama in this film, but for some reason I just felt like some of it was forced. I did get through it and it did offer some memorable moments. Just not nearly as many as some of the other names animes.",1353888000,4,431,4.4
8396734,5,B003H6KRHK,Air Tv movie is different from the series because it gives you a realistic view of what happened. It's less fantasy and more interaction between the main characters. I loved it and will watch it again.,1324252800,2,201,4.611111111111111
8396735,3,B003H6KRHK,"Reading reviews that claimed this movie ""actually improved on the source material"" got my hopes up.  Sadly, they were let down.

May as well start off with the bad:

The story was significantly ""trimmed"" to fit in the time frame (read: dumbed down).  Misuzu, Yukito, and Haruko, along with Kanna and Ryuya, are the only characters to get any attention.  Everybody else (Minagi, Kano, Uraha, Michiru, and Hijiri) got their roles reduced to mere cameos.  Even Potato is just a character briefly shown on a TV show.  Of course, this is permissible and can't be helped.

Haruko's character got massacred (mostly thanks to these time constraints), which is a shame, since she was my favorite.  She didn't get a chance to really foster up a relationship with Misuzu.  The writers apparently felt she had to feign hatred of Misuzu to get her to go with her father, but she was never given a chance to reconcile.

The animation style was drastically changed for this movie.  Most movie adaptations I've seen tend to be at least a LITTLE better than the series they're based off; sadly, the quality of animation--for the most part--was greatly reduced.  For one, the number of frames per second seemed to be way too few (actions seemed choppy and erratic).  Now that I think of it, most of the actions in and of themselves seemed unnatural and warped.  The sky and sea--the two most beautiful things visually in the original series--are now pretty much crap.  The water is all CGI, and the sky is hardly ever shown (when it is, it's mediocre looking).  The only characters with pretty eyes are Misuzu and Kanna.  Characters in general just seem poorly drawn.  There just seemed to be a lot of visual ""noise.""  At some points, it feels like I'm watching a bunch of pictures cut and pasted together.  They tried to do some weird things too.  Like one: making it look like the entire screen was curved around a convex lens.  And two: cutting the frame in half to focus on two different things at the same time.

Now for the good:

You get the same basic story (I guess; it went on an insane diet).  I guess it's okay if you have no time to watch the 12 episode original (although I REALLY think the series is WAY better than this).  Misuzu's summer project makes more sense and ties in better with the back story of the girl in the sky.

I like Yukito's role a lot more here (there's an actual romance between him and Misuzu).  There's also less of an apparent age difference between Misuzu and Yukito, so they seem about the same age.  (I've heard they were supposed to be close in age in the original series, but she just came across as too young and childish for him.)  She retains her clumsy charm, but not her childishness.  AKA:  She acts her age.  Yukito's personality seems to have improved in some ways (he seems less aloof and detached, and more ballsy), but was butchered in others (he put on a little Shinji Ikari ""run away from your problems and angst"" act, which I didn't appreciate at all).

The good songs from the original series came back (""Tori no Uta,"" ""Natsukage,"" ""Aozora"", ""Farewell Song"").  But there were also some random all-English songs thrown in (I don't know if it was this way for the original Japanese as well).  The English VAs reprised their respective roles, but it just didn't feel the same this time around.  They just didn't seem to have the feeling they possessed before.

The city the story is set in is also more believable.  In the series, it seemed odd how so few people lived in the city, but now, it's... well, like an actual city.  It makes more sense, but adds more distraction and noise.

All in all, I could only recommend this movie if you haven't seen the original series (or couldn't understand the story originally).  If you can, I recommend watching the series over this.  If you've seen the series, then view this at your own discretion.

PS:  If you're looking at the S.A.V.E. version of the movie, just know that the annoying green sticker is actually part of the case sleeve--not an actual sticker.  So if you buy it, you're stuck with it (even though it's cheaper).",1314921600,3,4112,4.585164835164835
8396736,2,B003H6KRHK,"While I certainly enjoyed Air TV, the movie for me left something to be desired. It seemed that the art style was changed, in a way I personally did not like. Also I noticed that they used stills and drawings in the movie, which left me feeling sort of cheated, as if the movie wasn't worth the cost. Since I own the series, I will probably sell this movie. For me it didn't add anything new other then annoyance. I felt much less connected with the characters, etc, which while it does make sense it still does nothing to justify my buying it. While I understand that many have an opinion different from mine, that is how I feel. If you own the series, you certainly don't need to add this to your collection as it adds nothing new. And if you haven't seen the series, buy it first. S.A.V.E packs are really cheap, and it's only $5 more for a much better product.",1297900800,,864,4.274390243902439

She heartily recommends it to others, believing that girls would enjoy it most.",1293667200,2,254,4.543478260869565
8396738,5,B003H6KRHK,"Air the Movie continues to hold its identity & popularity from the hit Air TV series. The storyline is beautiful & well written with the spotlight shining on Misuzu & Yukito. The focus of the storyline surrounds the developing romantic relationship between the two main characters of the anime series & the consequence from that affection. The plot is paced quickly to cover a lot of the storyline in a limited time but still slows down to focus on critical events of the movie.
The voice acting within this movie by Funimation was perfect in portraying the emotions, thoughts, feelings, & personalities of the characters. The scenery of this movie is well developed & the music is very calming but very sad. This will definitely strike a chord in your heart strings about the power of love & the power of the pain from love.
I make this anime movie compulsory (required) to all anime fans.
Thanks.",1287100800,4,898,4.726114649681529
8396739,5,B003H6KRHK,"I'm not going to rehash the plot , the other reviewers did a good job of that. This  is a wonderful but incredibly sad movie . I've watched some sad anime before , but this one had me really weeping (now I have a headache from dehydration 'Thanks Air movie').
  Air is a great movie. The character development is good for a 90 min. feature , the graphics are great and the story is really good , in fact you get 2 stories, the main story and the legend of the winged woman.
  So if you're in the mood for a good tear jerker , make yourself comfortable and keep plenty of tissue handy and enjoy Air the movie .",1280448000,,609,4.041666666666667
