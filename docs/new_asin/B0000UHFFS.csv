8003226,4,B0000UHFFS,"While I enjoy all three of the films in this box set (and that is the only reason I'm giving this four stars), the set itself leaves a lot to be desired.  The transfer of the films appears to be untouched, the extras are minimal at best, and it just isn't a fitting tribute to a series that actually has a lot going for it.  It seems as if the company that put it out just wanted to make a quick buck (following the grand exploitation tradition, I suppose) and released this thinking that fans would buy it no matter what.

They did.

The films deserve a Blu Ray, cleaned up, Vinegar Syndrome style release.  Until then, however, this is a fine way to own three of exploitation's more underrated films.",1462838400,2,702,4.32824427480916
8003227,4,B0000UHFFS,"Classic (not so) hardcore porn with graphic sex, real girls with real boobs, and a story line. This last is what separates these from modern adult media. They actually made an attempt to tell a story. Think of it was a B movie with sex. The dialogue is laughable, and that's a good thing because you never want to take work like this too seriously. Very un-PC, another good thing. All and all a nice collection of a classic series worth adding to your collection.",1450310400,3,463,4.458823529411765

So just sit back & enjoy.",1392336000,,110,4.285714285714286
8003231,4,B0000UHFFS,"I doubt that any of these movies could be made today, as just about every aggrieved interest group, left and right, would object loudly. But the early 70s were a very different time, when more things were possible, and this trio of movies is proof of that.",1375488000,2,256,4.468085106382978
8003232,5,B0000UHFFS,"I always thought that the three Ginger films were true anomalies. No one seems to remember them but anyone who saw them can not stop talking about them. They went against every Hollywood convention of cinema.  They were close to X-rated for its time showing full frontal male and female nudity and had extreme violence when called for.  These films were not the slick, studio eye candy that spy fans were used to, they were filmed as low budget productions way ahead of their time and showed the sleazy side of the genre dealing with drug smugglers, white slavery and prostitution rings before Pam Grier went vigilante in 'COFFY' and 'FOXY BROWN'. Director Andy Sidaris would produce over a dozen of these types of films throughout the eighties such as 'SAVAGE BEACH' with Julie Strain but the 'GINGER' series came first and were not peppered with breast implanted females and pumped up males.  They came out in the early seventies and really made an impression on this high school student who was used to James Bond, Matt Helm , and Derek Flint.  The closest I had ever seen to a kick ass female agent was Raquel Welch in 'FATHOM' and of course, Diana Rigg as Emma Peel in her black and white and color seasons of the British classic series 'THE AVENGERS' but here was a lethal lady who was no holds barred in her work methods as she tortured and killed the bad guys in some eye popping sequences. Each film was written and directed by Don Schain and starred Cheri Caffaro, a slim ,blonde with an expertise in Martial Arts and as they said in the press release: ""She was the best secret weapon ever to wear a dress"" or not to wear one.  Each film improves on the other and Caffaro's dry humor makes her adventures look like a walk through the park until the fight scenes occur.  In an earlier review I mistakenly credited actor Richard Smedley as her boss but a sharp reviewer named Blue-59 corrected me by crediting William Grannell who plays her boss and who also gets our heroine out of some close shaves. He also mentioned he was married to actress Lana Wood.  Thank you , Blue-59. The rape, castration, and violence may still be a bit strong for the kiddies so be warned.  To this day, I have never seen a female agent seduce her way thru the inner labyrinths of the criminal element in such a fashion as Ginger does. One minute she's making love and in a split second she has piano wire wrapped around the guys private part ready to slice and dice. You can imagine the outcome.  I have no favorites in this excellent collection. They all deliver the goods in their own way.  The styles and music may have dated the stories but you'll never forget Cheri Caffaro.  Highly recommended for spy fans who always anticipate a bit more and these films will not disappoint.",1282089600,10,2771,4.533066132264529
8003233,5,B0000UHFFS,Great to find some of the old Drive-in movies available.  This mini series is still a lot of fun to watch and brings back memories of the good old days back in the 70's and 80's.,1242432000,6,178,3.9444444444444446
8003234,5,B0000UHFFS,"I saw these films on the now defunct Escapade Pay TV Service.  Cheri Caffaro is pure B movie, she is a detective, like a white Foxy Brown.  In one scene she is at a bar dancing, she was just awful.  But at the same time, good ol Ginger would slice your [...] off if you gave her the chance.  I bought this set, and enjoy it very much.  Too bad they couldn't bring ol Ginger back for another romp, her [...] are probably hanging down to her knees by now.  Cheri Caffaro was great.",1240272000,4,479,4.042553191489362
