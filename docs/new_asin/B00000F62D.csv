1202626,5,B00000F62D,"This one movie personifies Central Coast California in the seventies perfectly. Viewing it is like being there among the actors. Martin Mull just exudes the attitudes of California. It is funny with perfect acting, and serves well as how California has mutated into one of the most liberal politically-correct places in the country today. However, the askng price of $29 begs it should be a DVD! How can a VHS of the 70's demand such an amount?",1150675200,4,444,4.779220779220779
1202627,5,B00000F62D,"It's about life in Marin County, California in the late 1970s. All the hippies have grown up and are so desperately trying to convince themselves that they're still hip that they've become a horrible parody of themselves, living in a world of pop psychobabble, open marriages and narcissism. In the center of all of this is Harvey Holroyd (Martin Mull) and his wife Kate (Tuesday Weld). Harvey is the sane man in an insane world, normal by every standard, but Kate is caught up in all the lunacy and keeps trying to drag him into the bizarro-world.

Don't let the movie's late-70's look fool you; it is absolutely *hysterical*. Look for Tommy Smothers as a ""priest"" (though in what church, I've no idea) who thinks everything is beautiful and Christopher Lee as a hard-ass businessman during the week who has a secret about what he does on weekends. There are so many plot twists, you'll never keep up with them all, but the whole movie is a laugh riot from start to finish. Be aware; this is a hard movie to find, but if you have an opportunity to get it, do not pass it up.

I suppose it's even funnier for me because my own parents were living out in San Francisco in the early 1970s and they say the film depicts almost exactly how people out there actually were. I've a hard time seeing my dad (who'd just gotten out of the Marines) and my mom (a strict Catholic and a Navy nurse) living in such a mad place.",1118102400,21,1413,4.409961685823755
1202628,4,B00000F62D,"For those folks expecting an Academy Award Best Picture nominee, go someplace else, but this movie does not suck that bad. It is meant as a comic take-off on life in Marin County in the 1970s. For those of you who don't know, Marin was--and is--an upscale suburb (sort of) north of San Francisco, which has taken a lot of kidding across the years for leading some of the wackier self-discovery movements. In the movie, Martin Mull finds himself out of place and yearns for a home more grounded in traditional values. The movie is not a particularly accurate description of Marin life circa the 70s, but it captures and pokes fun at a lot of the stereotypes of that time. The acting overall is not too bad and there are quite a few genuine laughs. Locals like to point out the contradictions in location movement from scene to scene, and take the jibes at their lifestyles almost with a sense of pride. I recommend it for a cheap rental. To those harsh critics above, ""LIGHTEN UP.""",1110067200,13,980,4.5423728813559325
1202629,5,B00000F62D,"This is a movie you can really love or really hate.  If you are a Northern California liberal you probably wouldn't like it.  The movie pokes fun at the lifestyles of those with a lot of time or money on their hands.  Those who would join offbeat religions, therapies, cults, fads, etc.  The focus is Marin County in the seventies but the satirical jabs could apply today as well - except for the gay jokes which I think would make most people today cringe.

I can't see any reason to get the Blu-ray over the regular DVD. The quality of the picture on the Blu-ray wasn't that great and there were no extras.  The movie itself is a satire of New Age living in Marin County, California in the late '70s and holds up well today.  Martin Mull and Tuesday Weld are wonderful as the Holroyds, the main couple.  She is a believer in consciousness raising, organic diets, green living, and therapy.  He is skeptical to put it mildly.  Their clashes provide much of the humor.  The Holroyds navigate through a maze of wacky and blissed out friends and neighbors and crazy situations.  Sally Kellerman steals every scene she's in.",1501459200,,826,4.602739726027397

1202767,5,B00000F62D,"This movie is about the 70s, not the 60s. It lampoons the commercialization of the 60s cultural revolution after it was mainstreamed, corporatized & New-Aged to death.

Serial is basically a satirical dark comedy in which a cast of Hollywood liberals makes fun of the hollow happy-face mentality of 70s SoCal. Like the best dark comedies, its very funny in a mildly disturbing way, since it has some serious social overtones that are still relevant today.

By the mid 70s, the important social advances of the 60s, like Civil Rights, womens rights, the anti-war & Free Speech movements, consumer & environmental protections, etc. had been co-opted into an absurd parody of 60s ideals; a superficial culture of trendiness that has defined American life ever since.

'60s radical experimentation, freethinking innovation and creative problem-solving were replaced by mindless mysticism, magical thinking, pop psychology, Scientology, self-help gurus, get-rich-quick seminars, 'Jesus Christ Superstar' revivalism, Moonies, Hare Krishnas, hot tubs, etc.

1202772,4,B00000F62D,"Boomers in the late 70s in Marin and SF. Everyone is having wild sex, getting re-married, doing drugs, and 'finding themselves'. It's how they rested on their laurels (in hot tubs) after a decade of protest and change.

The portrayals of diversity weren't completely insulting by today's standards. They even called-out non-intersectional feminism. But it was still problematic that the story was told by the white guy with conventional values who was sick of all the new-age BS. His old-school buddy tries following local trends and ends up dead. The happy ending involves moving away to some boring place, without any discussion, by order of Dad.

There was an unexpected kind of equality, where women were almost always the sexual aggressors. This is interesting because the straight white man might see life this way; women always actively tempting them.

I'd like to see the story re-told from the perspective of the other characters.

1202826,2,B00000F62D,"Olive Films basically took the old 2008 DVD, essentially repackaged it, and called it a Blu-ray. (Yeah, technically this is a Blu-ray disc that they manufactured, but it is no upgrade at all from the 2008 DVD.)

Love this movie, ""Serial,"" and always have since I saw it in a theater when it first came out.  It still cracks me up to this day.  Fun, funny, with clever writing, a cast with lots of then-well-known actors (some from TV), it was VERY fresh back then and that's evident NOW, it has a social message-- that's NOT dated-- and it's harmless.  You leave the theater, or your TV room, feeling good.  Great!

However, as to the Blu-ray quality . . . weak.  A VERY poor effort.  It looks like my old DVD was labeled with the Blu-ray logo, the Mbps on the picture pumped up to 25-33 Mbps (which doesn't improve picture quality in a substantial way, ever), they cleaned up SOME dirt and artifacts, and that was ALL that was done for the picture quality.  On my hi-def TV, it is A HAIR sharper in focus than my 2008 DVD, yet in a few scenes, is LESS focused than my DVD.  The picture on this Blu-ray is 16 x 9 (anamorphic), but so was the old DVD-- no improvement there. The color is IDENTICAL between the old DVD and this new Blu-ray.  What's the point?

They removed the music during the menu (vs. the DVD), also removed the scene names under ""Scenes,"" and relocated virtually all of the chapter starts. I know all this because I put in my old 2008 DVD (the DVD release of this Paramount film by ""Legend Films""), and compared them.

There are NO subtitles, not even in English (so as to not miss all the great lines) in EITHER the old DVD or this new Blu-ray.  NO extras in either.

Just another typical, poor, un-remastered, thoroughly unsatisfying Blu-ray from Olive Films. Why do they waste time putting out such crud?  Why do we buy these in advance of the release date (unable to see reviews), only to be disappointed?

I love this film, but, folks, apparently it will never look like a Blu-ray, even as 4K TV's will make this BR look even worse than it already does.

This was filmed in Marin County, and things have not changed much here over 35 years. Sandy Kellerman's character would be right at home. The movie pokes holes in the pretensions and phony posturing that pervades this beautiful place (and it is still very beautiful). Many of the characters have real life counterparts today. I recognize the spiritual leader Spike, the opportunistic psychologist, and Bill,the self hating guy who will say or do anything to get a woman into bed.

1202888,3,B00000F62D,"I'm going to say three stars, but would make it three and a half if that were an option.  Not that it means anything precise, anyway.

First, about the disc quality, I found the video acceptable if not great.  The audio was a worse issue, not just muffled but sometimes a bit jumbled.  And if you wanted subtitles or closed captioning to help pick up the gap, sorry, not on this DVD.  It was understandable, though, with the volume turned up louder than I normally have it.

And no DVD extras.  I tend to skip over those anyway, but it shows they're trying, and at least it's a talking point for the disc costing as much as it does.  Or would be, if it had them.

But about the movie itself.  It is good, if not quite as clever as I remembered.  Seeing it as a satire just of this one community in California might miss the point.  The fads shown here are part of larger cultural trends which have only grown and spread since.  There's the trendy spirituality which claims to respect all beliefs, but resists difficult questions, difficult answers, or being pinned down on actual meaning.  There is the  psycho-babble  jargon used to justify almost anything one wants to do as ""healthy"" and ""normal"".  There are the new-agey beliefs about diet, mental, and physical health, accepted with little actual regard for evidence.  And there is the complete self-absorption and smugness of people who can't imagine that they might actually be in the wrong, or that there even might be such things as right and wrong.  The film says what it has to say, with some clever little observations along the way, but it just seems that it have could have been more.  Maybe it's the acting, with a cast that seems as if it would have been more comfortable making a TV ""Movie of the Week"".  Maybe it's the writing, which is heavy on quips, not so much on extended intelligent dialog.

Mull's marriage is on the rocks.  His wife, played by Tuesday Weld, takes up with her EST-like guru (Smothers).  Bonerz plays a psychologist, privy to all the sordid secrets of the Marin County subculture.  There's a touch of irony that Bonerz played a dentist on The Bob Newhart Show, where Newhart played the psychologist.  Mull's best friend, played by Macy, is going through his own mid-life crisis.  Christopher Lee, with whom Mull unsuccessfully applies for a job, turns out to belong to a biker gang...a gay biker gang.  And Mull's daughter gets involved in a cult...not so funny after Jonestown... but in the context of this story, it works.  Perhaps because I lived in N. California at that time I found the satire to be spot on.  But I'll be the first to admit that, like Animal House, this movie may not be everyone's cup of tea.

1203008,5,B00000F62D,"Of course a comedy mocking Marin County in the 1970s is bound to aggravate the progressives, but that's EXACTLY what it set out to do. It was, after all, based on McFadden's sarcastic and mocking book of (about) the same name. But beyond the loony charicatures (and they abound), the writing snaps and the dialogue is pitch-perfect. I'll just give one short example: When Harvy Oldroyd (Martin Mull) goes bonkers at the goofball Indian drum ceremony wake of his best friend (William Macy) and has to be sedated by the neighborhood shrink, he groggily awakens a day or so later in bed. A friend's kid, ""Stokely,"" comes by to visit Mull in his bedroom and they have a short chat, to wit:

Harvey: ""So . . . what are people saying?""
Stokely makes a circling motion by his head, indicating insanity.
Harvey (nodding): ""Oh well.""
Stokely (quoting): ""In an insane world, the sane man must appear insane.""
Harvey (surprised at the kid's erudition): ""Where'd you hear that?""
Stokely: ""Star Trek.""
Harvey (after a beat): ""God, I miss that show.""

Look for prime performances from Christopher Lee as a gay weekend Hell's Angel, Tommy Smothers as the doofus ""Reverend Spike,"" and the enchanting Tuesday Weld as Harvey's flummoxed wife.

Then there is the tone of the film: this is a tricky film because it makes fun of things that have taken on respectable forms today: the motivational/consciousness/psych industry as well as the excesses of the women's movement and cultural liberalism in general. New Age was just getting started then and today things like Integral and Omega institute and many of the fads from California are more respectable, so the film's decision to criticize aspects of them might strike today's viewer as provincial at best and politically reactionary at worst. On one level it is a t.v. styled comedy about a harried, beleaguered square guy not ""in touch"" with the cult-like fads that have overtaken his family. But as the film progresses the fads grow ever more sinister. Actor Peter Bonerz deserves mention here as the film's toxic guru. Serial is really comedy about human extremism in any form. Serial is that rarest of things: a loose, racy, adult comedy that takes seems to give some credit to a conservative view. While not a right wing film per se it points to many flaws and problems with cultural and identity liberalism in a way that refuses to be moralistic. Indeed the film is a brief against moralism, moral hypocrisy and purism. It seems to be saying that the indulgent narcissim of the affluent characters has usurped the original promise of progressive liberalism.  The opening wedding ceremony with the absolute inanity of the couples' vows sets it all up. Yet how many couples today pretentiously create their own vows with similarly embarrasing results?
The acting by Tuesday Weld, Martin Mull, and Sally Kellerman is standard comedic acting, Bill Persky, the t.v. veteran, directs with a t.v. informed style. But Serial is a wonderfully mixed up workwith more questions than answers: is it saying liberal trends had become as dogmatic as the old conservatism? Are the allegedly ""sexist"" jokes and sympathy for mens' desire to just get some sexual attention from their wives and leave the talk about feelings points of view with which we should NOT, as Serial clearly does, sympathize? A rather daring work for its genre, all its formulaic aspects notwithstanding because Serial has a point of view.

I can get dizzy singing the praises of this movie - Sally Kellerman at her mandala-positioned sex focused best, early-onset hatred of the 60s in everyone's kids, and all the pre-Aids hook-ups you can eat.

Never a dull moment in the film, it hits on all cylinders a caricature of Marin County rich ""hip"", which of course these not very evolved residents miss the point completely.

What the other side of the Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco, tried in vain to enlighten all to (including them) a decade earlier, realness, truly caring about people, the planet, art, love, back to the earth, nature as what's real in life and peace.

Talk about missing the point, this movie is a funny look at Marin County's people, not unlike so many other places all around the country in the 70's, people where people just didn't quite get what the 60's were really all about, people who relied on television, Madison Ave and the phoniness of the media to explain it all to them.

These are basically mindless & lazy sheep with money, trying desperately, in-vain to be ""hip"" and it's funny to watch them talk themselves into things that are obvious only for their own pleasures while pretending more noble reasoning to their friends and fellow clueless.

It's a total riot seeing how differently they react to situations, for example disciplining their daughter, and attending their friends' ""pair bonding"" wedding.

Just about everyone is in therapy (or should be) and you see some of the therapy sessions.  Just about everyone is having affairs, doing drugs or going to orgies.  Most of the characters are liberals -- the kind that want to treat their domestic help as family mainly because of liberal guilt.  The movie pokes fun at the liberal lifestyle -- not in a mean spirited or judgmental way, but as satire.  And the movie being almost thirty years old (it's interesting to hear Harvey's comment about what the price of gasoline is or tell a head-hunter what his salary is), the issues of the day have clearly changed.",1177718400,2,977,4.739644970414201
1203068,5,B00000F62D,"As someone who grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area in the Seventies, I was in the middle of the culture being lampooned in this film, an era I remember with just as much fondness as derision. It captures the tail end of the innocence of the Sixties right before crass Eighties materialism, Neoconservative (sellout) Republicans and AIDS destroyed the last vestigates of the Woodstock/Hippie era and the promise of hope for the future.

I wish to God that Paramount would release this as a DVD. My VHS copy won't last forever, and I can't believe there aren't many others like myself who'd gladly have a permanent tribute on our film collections of that time and mood in our culture.",1171324800,2,684,4.652892561983471
1203069,5,B00000F62D,"A bunch of us started watching Serial about 20 years ago, and have watched it every year or so ever since. This movie, with its good-natured satire of the northern California lifestyle of the '70s, is just as funny now. There are almost more good lines in Serial than there are in Airplane!!

Yes, it should be available on DVD. It makes me nervous that it's so hard to get a copy of now even on VHS. And so expensive!",1160352000,3,418,4.225
1203070,5,B00000F62D,"I suppose if enough people issue comments like this to enough places, somebody will eventually listen and release the DVD.  When you think of all the ""trash"" that gets a DVD release, it is really hard to imagine that ""Serial"" hasn't.  I've got the Laser Disk, but my last player has died.  I no longer own VHS equipment and wouldn't pay $59 for tape, anyway.",1160006400,4,358,4.476923076923077

7906912,5,B00000F62D,"I always liked this movie. I tend to like the quirky and offbeat type of movies. Having lived through the era, I find it especially funny. If you don't have the background of understanding the time period (1970's to 1980's) you won't really ""get"" much of it.",1525132800,,258,4.51063829787234

7906916,3,B00000F62D,"I had to see this. I didn't even know there had been a movie. It doesn't even come anywhere close to the book by Cyra McFadden written in 1976. I was a teen back then and it was so true to the time and every single line, paragraph was side splitting witty and hilarious that I feasted on the memory of reading it for decades. I am a voracious reader so that is saying a lot. The movie hardly conveys any of it. I'm giving it 3 stars for the fun, the actors, the fact that it was made back then and maybe someone will want to buy the book.",1516320000,,538,3.9
