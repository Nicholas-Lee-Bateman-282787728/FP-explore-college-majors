""Roxana"" is enchanting, blood-tingling.  It's sumptuous and moving... and it takes your breath away.  John Doyle, The Globe and Mail

Mossanen's film is an opulent and erotic re-telling of the sliding fortunes of this boldly ambitious courtesan. Re-imagined in a 20th century setting, Roxana positions the viewer as unabashed voyeur to her string of affairs... For the viewer, the result is nothing less than visually and emotionally stunning.  Christine Clarke, Dose.ca

Moze Mossanen's ambitious film recasts Daniel Defoe's seminal courtesan-gone-wild novel into a mid-20th-century showgirl saga, regarding its eponymous heroine (Greta Hodgkinson) with equal measures of empathy, exasperation and gape-jawed fascination.  Adam Nayman, EYE Magazine

The production is sumptuous and sexy, complete with gorgeous sets and costumes and some very dark and unusual dance routines.  Hodgkinson has a powerful presence on camera, particularly when we see her full body in movement.  Mike Vokins, Xtra Magazine

The titular Roxana [is] played to sizzling perfection by dancer Greta Hodgkinson.  Torontoist.ca

McCarthy's dance of sexual longing is one example of the film's ability to pack an emotional wallop.  It is so over the top that it gets right oh top of you - and for all the right reasons.  Deirdre Kelly, Elle Magazine

Mossanen has cornered the market on erotica in dancefilm.  The production values and costumes from the `50s and 60s are gorgeous, and Robert Campanella has choreographed Roxana with a sexy and sumptuous eye.  Greta Hodgkinson is stunning as the single-minded heroine, and Sheila McCarthy smokes the screen as Amy.  Paula Citron, the globeandmail.com
