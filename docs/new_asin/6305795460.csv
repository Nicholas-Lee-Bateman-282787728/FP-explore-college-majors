7896750,4,6305795460,"Boasting a solid cast, The Settlement does not disappoint.  The tale of two ambulance chasing insurance policy sharks--played with flair and edginess by the great John C. Reilly and William Fichtner--this is a sharp piece of filmmaking by writer-director Mark Seilen.  In the 80s, their business--Viable Settlements--does so well that Jerry (Fichtner) buys a huge gaudy 8-bedroom house, about 90% of the space of which he doesn't need.  He equates the trappings of his success with an obvious part of the male anatomy, for which there are numerous nicknames (he's fond of using one in particular).
But in the 90s, their business--based on cashing in on terminally ill patients--goes bust.  Into their lives comes Barbara, an astoundingly sexy femme fatale, played to the hilt by Kelly McGillis.  She claims to have an inoperable brain tumor that will result in her death in only three months, the payoff for which is a big fat two mil.  All she wants up front is a quarter of that.  Being down--WAY down--on their luck, the boys come up with the money through decidedly illicit means.
The twists and turns, while not really unexpected, are fun to watch, and the actors all do a great job, relishing their noir roles with real gusto.  Along for the ride as well are David Rasche as an arrogant surgeon, Dan Castellaneta (remember him from all those Fox TV shows?) as a grateful customer, and Stuart Pankin as a helpful attorney.
While noticeably obscure, this is nevertheless a fun film and not a time-waster at all.",1068595200,5,1515,4.867704280155642
7896751,5,6305795460,"This movie has turned out to be one of my favorites and I have the reviews and their authors to thank. These two ""character actors"", William Fichtner and John C. Reilly, have leading man potential. Wonder why no one in Hollywood gets it. We, the viewers, know. Oh, I forgot, William Fichtner WAS cast as one of the two male leads in ""Passion of Mind"", primarily to carry the movie and make Demi Moore look good - which he did, easily. I knew he was a fine comic actor. I saw ""Drowning Mona"" and he and Jamie Lee Curtis shine. John C. Reilly really came through in ""Chicago"". Thanks to all who recommended this gem.",1057708800,8,614,4.3478260869565215
7896752,5,6305795460,"I rented this movie on the strength of the story outline on the back of the box, and for the fact that it had John C. Reilly in it, who I think is the finest character actor in movies. I got much more than I expected. This movie has an excellent script and wonderful directing. The humor is dry, black and understated and very effective. To me the big suprises were the performances of William Fichtner as one of the partners in the insurance scam. Fichtner's performance brimmed with intelligence and depth, as well as a sure comic touch that was dead on the money. Also, Kelly McGillis turned in a job so full of savage sex and menace, I found myself wondering why she doesn't get more work. As for John C. Reilly - does this actor ever make a wrong move in front of a camera? No, he does not. This is his best work. A real gem.",1005004800,10,830,4.19375
