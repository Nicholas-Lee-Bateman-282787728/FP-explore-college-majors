8511093,5,B0076PCZAU,"This video is an excellent learning experience as it will teach intermediate and advanced dancers all the hidden facets of what transforms a turn or jump into an exciting experience for the audience. The young demonstrator, Saige Miller, keeps on improving her execution throughout the video under Finis Jhungs expert scrutiny and precise coaching. The video starts at the barre with practice of the pirouette en dehors and then moves on with more and more complex movements and combinations in the center that require frequent change of directions and balance. Finis divulges those little secrets to artistry that are not known by many dancers. For example, I was so grateful to hear how you can develop a winged foot in arabesque, something never explained to me before. Another very important aspect of this video is the focus on knowing and properly executing the preparations for both turns and jumps some of which are definitely more challenging for an older adult student like methe ballott, the ballon, or the grand pirouette en dedans and the grand fouette en tournant but nonetheless it is wonderful to see how steps like these can be used in organic and beautifully danceable combinations. This video is a culmination of two earlier videosLevel 4 Turns and Level 4 Jumpsintegrating and nuancing the knowledge and practice for both students and teachers, or people like mewho like many older adult studentsare simply trying their best. What an invaluable resource! I strongly recommend all three videos in order to master both turns and jumps.
