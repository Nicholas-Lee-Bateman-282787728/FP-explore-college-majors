113415,5,0790744813,"This is a very good musical from 1949.  The cast is strong and includes Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra.  Gene Kelly also directs and choreographs.  Vera Ellen plays one of the female characters and is one of my very favorite female dancers.  I thought she was borderline spectacular in ""White Christmas"" made a few years later.  Although somewhat stylistically dated, this musical is of Academy Award stature and is well worth viewing, especially for a student of Hollywood History.

113551,5,0790744813,"ON THE TOWN [1949] [Blu-ray] M-G-Ms Big Color By Technicolor Musical! The Freshest, Most Invigorating and Innovative Screen Musical of Its Decade!

New York, New York, it's a wonderful town, especially when sailors Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra and Jules Munshin have a 24-hour shore leave to see the sights . . . and when those sights include Ann Miller, Betty Garrett and Vera-Ellen.

Co-directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, based on the Broadway hit and set to an Academy Award winning adaptation score, On the Town changed the landscape of movie musicals, opening filmmakers' eyes to what could be done on location. And when brilliant location and studio production numbers are blended, it could be as here and ebullient, up-and-at-'em perfection. The Bronx is up and the Battery's down, but no one can be down after going On the Town.

FILM FACT: The film was an instant success and won the Academy Award for Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture, and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Cinematography (Color). Screenwriters Adolph Green and Betty Comden won the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Musical. Judy Holliday was uncredited as the voice of Daisy Simkins. The musical numbers staged on location in New York were the first time a major studio had accomplished this. The location shots in New York took nine days.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: On the Town may not be the greatest Hollywood musical ever produced;  compared to the likes of Singin' in the Rain, The Wizard of Oz, The Band Wagon and several others would all garner consideration with  Singin' in the Rain  probably receiving the most attention. But  On the Town is so unconventional for its time, is separate from the rest for several very special reasons, Most significantly, the film was partially shot outdoors; it instigated the use of increased on-location shooting for films of that genre. On the Town  is one of the few features in which the talents of two filmmakers are so happily blended; Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, the co-directors, later went on to make  Singin' in the Rain and  It's Always Fair Weather.

On the Town [1949] is undoubtedly one of the key works in the development of the Hollywood musical. Up to that time, musicals were entirely studio-bound, with rare exceptions such as the Brooklyn Bridge sequence in It Happened in Brooklyn (1947). Directors Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen wanted to use extensive locations, but the studio allowed only one week of shooting in New York. It proceeded at breathless pace, often using hidden cameras to avoid crowd problems. Another innovative feature, also part of the Broadway stage production, is their use of modern dance to advance the plot in sequences such as ""Miss Turnstiles"" and ""A Day in New York."" Gene Kelly's interest in using modern dance would develop further in the climactic ballet of An American in Paris [1951] and Invitation to the Dance [1956].

Gabey, Chip and Ozzie have exactly 24 hours' shore leave in New York and are determined to see all the sights and find some romance along the way. Chip is pursued by Brunhilde ""Hildy"" Esterhazy, an aggressive taxi-driver. Ozzie hits it off with Claire, an anthropologist, while visiting the Museum of Natural History. Gabey, on the other hand, has his hopes pinned on a seemingly impossible dream: ""Miss Turnstiles,"" whose poster he sees on the subway. However, this is New York and a lot can happen in one day. Frank Sinatra, in one of his first starring roles, gets his chance to croon, Gene Kelly to dance, and Jules Munshin to pull in the yuks, while the rest of the cast, particularly Vera-Ellen and Ann Miller, shine brightly in their own set pieces, with ballet and tap dancing showstoppers, respectively.

Characterisations are established not only by dialogue and performance but in terms of song and dance: ""Prehistoric Man,"" set in the Museum of Natural History and tap-danced by anthropology student Ann Miller displays her character's aggressiveness in pursuing Jules Munshin; in ""Come Up to My Place,"" shy Frank Sinatra finally succumbs to the charms of taxi driver Betty Garrett. These two women are certainly no standard, passive heroines, and are unusually liberated for their day by the manner in which they relate to, and compete with, men.

The two aforementioned dance numbers, along with the songs ""New York, New York"" and ""Come Up to My Place,"" were the only musical numbers retained for Leonard Bernstein's original score. Betty Comden and Adolph Green, were hired by M-G-M to write new lyrics. Roger Edens composed six new songs, receiving an Academy Award along with Musical Director Lennie Hayton in the process.

On the Town is an energetic, effervescent combination of reality and fantasy, especially compared to West Side Story and Funny Girl and so many other subsequent musicals owe their very existence to the creativity and vision of Gene Kelly and company. If modern audiences are able to keep an open mind to the prevalent views of the times the film had been made in, there is more than enough in On the Town to recommend for lovers of musicals, particularly those who enjoy the dancing of Gene Kelly and co., and the singing of Frank Sinatra. It's charming, humorous, effervescent, and a perfect postcard to all that exemplifies the infinite paths and possibilities of New York City at its 'Big Apple' finest.

Blu-ray Video Quality  On the Town was shot in three-strip Technicolor by Harold Rossen, and Warner Home Videos 1080p encoded image on this Blu-ray was clearly not beneficiary of the patented ""Ultra Resolution"" process recently featured on Warner Home Video release of The Band Wagon.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 1.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Mono is in fine shape and, within the limitations of the era, does justice to the musical numbers and vocal performances, which were studio-recorded. The dynamic range is limited, but the highs aren't harsh and the lows aren't bad. Both dialogue and lyrics are clearly rendered. On the Town has always sounded a bit like this and I am not entirely certain as per the reasons why. But, Warner Home Video has done the utmost to preserve and remaster where possible. You will surely not be disappointed with the results. I know I wasnt.  Finally, what a shame Warner Home Video have provided and audio commentary and isolated score too.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Vintage Feature: John Nesbitts Passing Parade: Mr. Whitney Had a Notion [1949 M-G-M B/W Short] [1949] [1080i] [4:3] [10:46] This Passing Parade entry tells of a little-known story in American history. Eli Whitney, famous for inventing the cotton gin, was given a US government contract to produce a large number of rifles over a two-year period. In order to fulfil the contract, he developed the concept of mass production. Instead of one person crafting a whole rifle, several persons make individual parts that are assembled later. Cast (in credits order) Lloyd Bridges, Erville Alderson, Howard Negley, Harry Hayden, Mitchell Lewis and John Nesbitt. Screenplay and Narrated by John Nesbitt.

Vintage Cartoon: Doggone Tired [1949 M-G-M Cartoon] [1949] [480i] [4:3] [7:36] First great variation on the topic of the noise, rather obsessional in Tex Avery's work. An energetic dog needs a night's rest if he's going to be ready for rabbit hunting at dawn. A crafty rabbit overhears a hunter tell his dog that he'll have to get plenty of sleep if he wants to catch the rabbit in the morning. In the interests of self-preservation, the rabbit devotes his entire night to keeping the dog awake in a variety of creative ways.

Trailer: On the Town with James A. FitxPatrick  The Voice of the Globe [1949] [480i] [4:3] [3:00] This a Special Theatrical Trailer for the M-G-M On the Town. One unfortunate thing with this particular trailer, especially for its time, is the wording at the end of the trailer, where is states, Twice as gay as Anchors Aweigh. American documentary film director. After completing training in the dramatic arts, he worked for a while as a journalist. In 1925 he entered films and specialized throughout his career in travel documentaries. Besides directing, he also wrote, produced, and narrated many of his films. M-G-M distributed a series of his travel films under the umbrella titles ""Fitzpatrick Traveltalks"" and ""The Voice of the Globe,"" as did Paramount as ""VistaVision Visits."" The hallmarks of James A. Fitzpatrick's films were Technicolor photography and stolidity.

Finally, some people consider On the Town to be more Gene Kelly's film than Frank Sinatra's, and it's true that Gabey is considered the lead role on Broadway. Still, the show remains a brilliant quintessential ensemble piece, that has been an all-time favourite Hollywood Musical film of mine, and especially with the strong performances by all six actors and actresses playing the sailors and their whirlwind romantic partners. As directors, Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen found the right chemistry, which is why the film worked so well despite a watered-down script. Since Warner Home Video is unlikely to re-master the Blu-ray, this is the best we will ever probably get, but despite this, I am so happy to have it in my Warner Home Video Collection, as it is far superior to anything that was previously released on the inferior NTSC DVD format. Highly Recommended!

That said, it isn't a very good version of the stage musical on which it is based, but it was one of MGM's big musicals of its day. Moreover, it was actually shot on the streets of New York City, and was one of the first musicals to go ""on location"" rather than being shot in the studio backlot. Gene Kelly and Vera Ellen are the romantic leads, and the lead dancers, though the others hold their own. Frank Sinatra was the heartthrob singer of the bunch and what songs were left in the film from the stage play -- a common practice was to trim a stage musical with 14 or 15 songs into a six or seven song film musical -- are superb.

113558,3,0790744813,"This Blu-ray disc is mostly a massive improvement visually on the DVD which I criticised as being poor in a previous review. The picture is for the most part as good as you could reasonably expect for a movie of this age. Three strip technicolor alignment is very good, the print is scratch and flicker free. The DVD's cropping of the image has been remedied. Bright objects are surrounded by glows, probably a lens artifact at the time of shooting. However, at 6 mins 40 seconds there is a short scene with a chroma keyed background which has been wrecked in the restoration with moving bright yellow glows surrounding everyone in the scene. This scene in previous releases isn't exactly convincing, but the yellow glows aren't visible.

The mono DTS HD soundtrack is bright and clear if a little thin. However, the modern fad of compressing audio is all too apparent on the opening song by the dock worker which crackles on the last line as the compressor turns up the quiet audio on this piece. This again isn't apparent on the DVD.

Despite these criticisms, the Blu-ray is a worthwhile upgrade.

The movie of course is a classic!",1432252800,2,1134,4.688442211055277

113560,2,0790744813,"Having recently seen the excellent revival on Broadway, I decided to go back and see this version of the musical which I hadn't seen since it came out years ago on DVD . All I can say is after viewing it all I can say is that this was 98 min of my life that I will never get back.  Bernstein's great score is almost entirely discarded in favor of what can't even be called mediocrity; Comden and Green have matched the insipid music with equally insipid lyrics for the new songs.  I can only guess that they must have had guns pointed to their heads and forced to work. The cast does what it can with the poor material but even their valiant efforts can't make this rise above the level of drivel.  I know this was the `40's and Broadway was way ahead of Hollywood  in handling  anything with even the hint of being risqu, but  the whitewashed plot leaves this picture with nothing but another run of the mill story.  Hollywood has almost always had a very hard time translating Broadway hits into movies, for me the most successful outcomes being ""The Music Man"" and ""1776""  but if you wrote a book on how not to do it , ""On The Town"" would be your example.  The Movie is I feel  also lacking all the energy and joy of the Broadway version.  Add to that the insult that the Blu-ray transfer looks like it was done without any attempt at restoration or care. Images aren't particularly sharp and the fine details you see when care is taken in doing the transfer like in ""Singing in the Rain"" are missing.  The best you can say is that it looks better than the old dvd version.  If you want to see Sinatra and Kelly as sailors then watch the superior, despite its also lack luster transfer to Blu-ray, ""Anchors Aweigh"" with its wonderful score by Jule Styne /Sammy Cahn  and the added pleasure of seeing the great pianist, Jose Iturbi  (who I meet years ago and was one of the nicest and most endearing people I have ever met)and watching (with no offense to the incomparable Ann Miller) the dancing of Kelly with Jerry the Mouse. It will be a better spending of you movie time.",1431561600,,2077,4.330749354005168

He was a terrific athletic dancer with a reasonably decent singing voice. I'm so glad it's on Blu Ray. Frank Sinatra's a real treat with Betty Garrett. You'll even notice Mrs. Kravitz, the wonderfully nosy neighbor on Bewitched. The movie looks great. The last time I saw it on TCM, it was horribly grainy.",1430784000,2,598,4.254385964912281

113596,5,0790744813,"It's pointless to complain about the really great songs they dropped from the film version of the Broadway show, because this is really terrific as it is. The songs they did drop, however, were seriously good, but for some reason Roger Edens disliked them and replaced them with some of his own.  But Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly could have done a great job of the best of them. Sinatra could have done a wonderful version of Lonely Towm and Kelly could easily have pulled off Lucky to be Me. So the loss of this great material is unfortunate. But this is such a bright funny effort, with some high energy dancing, and terrific performances you have to accept it on its own terms. Alice Pierce is hilarious, and despite the shortcomings in the musical department, it's a classic. Ann Miller's  dancing in the Prehistoric Man number is about as good as it gets. I'd love to hear a really top studio performance of the entire Bernstein score. The one that exists is way too operatic. It's not that Edens new songs are terrible, but they're ordinary compared to the original material.",1411084800,,1081,4.625

This is a film school/dance and musical stage video - long past what many would call entertainment due to the absence of murder, mayhem, low-life language and car crashes.  On The Town came from a generation of nobodies who finished fighting a war, mourned over the loss of friends, saw the worst in all of us and still painted a smile on millions of faces.  An escapist movie that, if a viewer simply wants to be entertained, he/she or they would find their money well spent.  This is truly not just Granny's movie...I wish to believe that even a six year old would get a kick out of it.  Movies, after all, are pictures of the past - ""On The Town,"" ""Casablanca,"" ""Gone With The Wind"" and millions more are pictures, greater snapshots of who we were and how far we have either come or failed to achieve.

Three sailors, played by Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, and Jules Munshin, who are on 24-hour leave in New York, and want to see all the sights before they have to be back on the ship the next morning.  Gaby, Kelly's character, falls in love with Ivy Smith, Miss Turnstiles (played by Vera-Ellen), or more accurately, her picture.  Along the way, the sailors meet up with Hildy Esterhazy, a flirtatious cab driver (Betty Garrett, who played Archie Bunker's neighbor Irene Lorenzo in ALL IN THE FAMILY, and landlady Edna Babish in LAVERNE & SHIRLEY), and tap-dancing anthropologist Claire Huddesen (the great Ann Miller).  The three sailors eventually find Ivy, and all three of them fall in love (Gaby with Ivy, Chip (Sinatra) with Hildy, and Ozzie (Munshin) with Claire.  There are fun and misadventures along the way, but the movie ends happily, with the girls sharing one last kiss with the sailors before they have to go back on board.

The songs, including ""New York, New York, A Wonderful Town"" (it was ""A Hell Of A Town"" on Broadway, but you couldn't say the ""H word"" in a 1949 movie) and the title track, are magnificent.  The dances, particularly Kelly's ""Main Street"" fantasy tap duet with Vera-Ellen, and Annie Miller's solo to ""Prehistoric Man,"" are wonderful as well.  Although they perform together in the ensemble numbers, the producers missed a chance to put two of the best female tappers - Miller and Vera-Ellen - together for a tap duet.

It was originally a Broadway hit with music by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, itself a reworking of a Jerome Robbins ballet called Fancy Free. Gene Kelly directed and choreographed the film with Stanley Donen. Some of the Bernstein tunes were dropped in the film to be replaced by others composed by Roger Edens, Conrad Salinger and Lennie Hayton. But the rousing opening number, `New York, New York, It's a wonderful town' was retained as were some of the ballet sequences. In fact, the whole film was very balletic, which reflects its origins. It's a shame though that one of Bernstein's most poigniant ballads, Lonely Town was dropped - but it was resurrected by Sinatra in his LP with Gordon Jenkins, 'Where Are You?' The girls after whom the sailors chased were Vera-Ellen (`Miss Turnstiles'), Ann Miller (an anthropologist, would you believe), and Betty Garrett (as a lady cab driver). Though the storyline has now been somewhat overworked (we meet much the same again in Three Sailors and a Girl, and Hit the Deck), the film as a whole is thoroughly entertaining for most of its 98 minutes.

113704,5,0790744813,"Four years after World War II, all the men are back and ready to get it on.  What we call the baby boom!  I love pre-feminist movies about human sexuality.  On the Town is a movie about three sailors who are in New York, trying to meet girls.  And they are singing and dancing.  It is a happy, fun, amazing movie.  I am so living in the wrong era.  This is healthy sexuality.  This movie can't exist in our era, because in our era young men are bad.  Aggressive and bad.

On the Town is a movie about sex, getting it on with your sexual opposite, like a caveman.  Woo-hoo!  Being open to love and feeling it.  It's a passionate movie, an aggressive movie, a romantic movie.  It's a movie for young men feeling their oats.  This film is pre-feminist and unapologetically shows sexual pursuit as a good thing.  Man's aggressive chase after woman is seen as happy and fun and normal.  If you're not chasing after a woman, she's gonna chase after you.

Once feminism hit, with its war on masculinity and its policing of sexuality, art followed orders or rebelled.  Our musicals became gay or girly.  Screwball comedies became talky chick flicks.  And there was a massive, unspoken revolt by men from music and dance in film.  What do we watch?  Violent movies.  Taxi Driver or Kill Bill.  Unhealthy, aggressive, homicidally violent movies.  The attempt to neuter men has made our art more violent.  On the Town is from a happier time.

On the Town is a musical, but it's not a chick flick.  It's aggressive and fun.  And why not?  Dancers are amazing athletes.  Capturing Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire on film is a miracle, like seeing Jackie Chan in his prime, or Buster Keaton.  You have to train for years and years to get your body to be so good at something.  So don't put lame ass John Travolta or Burt Reynolds or Dolly Parton or Olivia Newton-John out there and pretend like you've made some amazing musical.  Just cause you're dancing doesn't mean you rock.

What's awesome about this movie is the innocence of it, how nice its assumptions are.  Now, 1949 was a pretty cynical year.  You know it had to be, four years after the atom bomb and the Holocaust.  Sometimes you throw art out there to show what life can be.  What it should be.  And On the Town is like that.  Fun and happy and cool.  My vote for the happiest movie ever made.

Taylor

In addition, it is pretty interesting to see a comically inspired young Betty Garrett, who to people of my generation will always be Archie Bunker's wise cracking liberal Italian arch nemesis neighbor Irene Lorenzo...  Further, Vaudevillian Song and dance man Jules Munshin does more than his fair part in stealing the show.  - - A pre-iconic Frank Sinatra is pretty amazing to see as the young boy-toy song and dance man, and his ""Come Up To My Place"" routine with Garrett is definitely one of the high points of the film.

My only disappointment is that an hour into the film, the plot is pretty much exhausted and with the ending pretty much apparent, the film starts to fizzle/recoup the fizzle and recoup.... it sizzles, not in the sense of being dull, but rather crossing the fine line between ""inspired"" and ""corny"" --  at one point even the song writing even seems a bit emulative (kind of Cole Porter's Kiss Me Kate minus the genius) - - however, in the end, after the big car chase, some zany cross dressings, and this and that, things all get sorted out and all is well that ends well.

All in all:  a major plus is that although ON THE TOWN deviates from the stage play, it does manage to capture a lot of the edge and excitement of a real musical (great choreography and equally splendid cutting and cinematography practically carry the film at times) - - the downside, considering the writing team of Comden and Green, its amazing that so few of the numbers are actually memorable...

113728,4,0790744813,"The story of three sailors Gabey (Gene Kelly), Chip (Frank Sinatra) and Ozzie (Jules Munshin)looking for love (in the form of Ann Miller, Betty Garrett and Alice Pearce)while on a one day leave for the first time in New York , ""On The Town"" continues to be a marvelous musical. It may lack the flash of later Donen-Kelly collaborations but it never loses sight of its purpose--to entertain. That along with marvelous location shooting in New York (a rarity at the time) makes ""On the Town"" unique.

Based on the popular 1944 Broadway musical co-written by Leonard Bernstein and directed by Jerome Robbins, ""On the Town"" was notable for a number of firsts. It was the first musical shot on location in New York City. It was the first collaboration between director Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly. It was Donen first film. It also marked the first films of Carol Haney and Bea Benaderet. Although it was lost in the wake of later Kelly-Donen films including ""Singing in the Rain"", ""On the Town"" perfectly captures the magic of the play and cast.

Many of the original songs were replaced by new material as producer Arthur Freed felt that they were a bit too sophisticated for the average American filmgoer. The result is that we have a mixed score with material by Roger Edens and Bernstein (with lyrics co-written by Adolph Green and Betty Comden). Although the new material isn't as strong as the Bernstein material, the film overcomes these hurtles by incorporating strong choreography.

The re-release of this film accompanies a new boxed set of Kelly-Sinatra musicals although all the titles for that box set are available individually.

""On the Town"" looks terrific with nice robust colors that capture the look of the early three strip Technicolor process. Although a bit grainy at times, the film looks quite good. Sure, the studio could have cleaned up the look of the film a bit more but films that have that digital sheen often lose much of their character in the process. I'm not sure if this has been reissued because a new high definition master has been prepared or not but it looks extremely good in its new presentation.

The mono soundtrack sounds great with a nice dynamic range and no noticeable drop outs. There was some minor clipping but on the whole the sound is terrific.

No new special features in this reissue with only the original theatrical trailer included. It's a pity because there are BBC interviews with Kelly and recent TCM interviews with other cast members discussing the making of the film. If they were well integrated with production/promotional stills, new observations by film historians and footage from the film we could have a fine featurette. We could also find out bits of trivia about the shooting of the film for example co-star Jules Munshin's fear of heights. That necessitated that he perform at least one musical number with a rope tied around him (the other end was tied to co-director Stanley Donen who was off screen) and it would also explain his almost obsessive need in one particular dance sequence to touch and run his hands across the various props.

 A marvelous musical with Kelly, Sinatra and the rest of the cast in top form, ""On the Town"" has lost none of its charm, wit or entertainment value. The vintage footage of New York City during the late 40's will also be delightful to viewers. It's a pity this wasn't spiffed up for release.",1211068800,3,3402,4.783645655877343
113729,2,0790744813,"""On the Town"" tells the story of three sailors - Gabey, Ozzie and Chip - on 24-hour leave in wartime New York City. Gabey falls in love with a subway poster of Ivy Smith, ""Miss Turnstiles"" for the month of June. Gabey, aided by Ozzie, Chip and two of their gals, goes on a hunt for Ivy. After several adventures and a disappointing blind date with Hildy's roommate, Lucy Schmeeler, Gaby finds Ivy.

Let me say first that film version of ""On the Town"" is lively and entertaining, but no more so than many musicals of the 1940s, including ""Anchors Aweigh,"" the very enjoyable 1945 movie starring Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly as two sailors on leave in Hollywood.

The musical score of that film (by Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne) is excellent. Sinatra's rendition of ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" still leaves me with chills. But I'll leave it to others to argue over which is the better film.

There are at least two ways to review ""On the Town"" or any other film of a Broadway musical:  Take it for what it is, or express regrets over what it could have been. I fall into the latter camp.

""On the Town"" opened on Broadway in 1944 and ran for more than 460 performances - a healthy run for shows of the time. It was an ""integrated"" show, in which the book, songs and dances are tightly bound to advance the plot. Choreograper Jerome Robbins created innovative dances full of energy. The forerunner of ""On the Town was the highly successful Leonard Bernstein-Robbins ballet ""Fancy Free."" The creation of the musical play was inspired by Robbins.

In 1960 Columbia Records released ""The First Full-Length Recording"" of the show, which included members of the original cast:
(Nancy Walker as Hildy the taxi driver, Betty Comden as Claire DeLoone (Claire Huddeson in the film) the anthropologist, Adolph Green (Ozzie) and Cris Alexander (Chip) as two of the sailors. John Battles as the other sailor (Gabey) is not heard on the album (John Reardon performs in his place. This is the REAL ""On the Town.""

But producer Arthur Freed felt that the songs in the play were too sophisticated for film audiences, so most of the numbers in the play were dropped and second-rate composer Roger Edens filled out the score  (I have to assume that Comden and Green were dragooned into writing the substandard lyrics that accompanied Edens' music). All of this confirms the saw that no one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American people.

(Producers weren't entirely at fault. The Production Code Administration's censors were always on the lookout for anything that might violate its strict, moralistic code.)

Even the two of the three songs that were retained in the movie, ""New York New York"" and ""Come Up to My Place,"" were reduced to shadows of the original versions. Leonard Bernsteins's jazzy score was castrated by orchestrator Conrad Salinger and clever lyrics were dropped or altered. These factors changed the atmosphere and mood of the film.

Among the songs that were omitted: ""Lucky to Be Me,"" which has become a standard, sung by Gabey as he awaits his date; ""I Can Cook Too,"" Hildy's witty mating song for Chip; ""Carried Away,"" another funny number sung by Claire and Ozzie in the museum, in which they express a mutual weakness  (the song was replaced by the silly ""Primitive Man"" number, which was only salvaged by Ann Miller's dancing; ""Some Other Time,"" a poignant song, with a marvelous vocal arrangement, that acknowledges that the 24-hour leave is almost over (there are about two dozen versions of this song currently in print); ""Ya Got Me,"" a propulsive, bouncy song with a Latin beat that the gang sings to Gabey to cheer him up (this was replaced in the film by an inferior, corny C&W song.

For many successful musicals, MGM turned to established outside composers and lyricists. ""Meet Me in St. Louis,"" ""The Harvey Girls"" and ""It Happened in Brooklyn"" are just three examples of this practice.
Roger Edens is simply not in their league.

So, I suggest that anyone who reads this review acquire or hear the 1960 Columbia album, or even the 1992 studio version that includes even more music.

113731,5,0790744813,"New York, New York, a helluva town.

The Bronx is up, but the Battery's down.

The people ride in a hole in the groun'.

New York, New York, it's a helluva town!

On The Town let MGM showcase some of their very finest talents: Frank Sinatra, Gene Kelly and Jules Munshin play three sailors who get a 24 hour pass to see the city. These men play their roles as Chip, Gabey and Ozzie magnificently. They sing and dance with three wonderfully talented ladies: Betty Garrett plays Brunhilde 'Hilde' Esterhazy, Chip's love interest; Ann Miller portrays Claire Huddesen, Ozzie's flirting partner for the day and Vera-Ellen plays Ivy Smith, or ""Miss Turnstiles,"" who is chased after by Gabey.

The movie plot is not very sophisticated; the idea of three sailors on shore leave to see the New York City and find some girls to celebrate with does not require much imagination. However, this remains a classic musical from ""The Dream Factory"" even today. The song and dance numbers impress me and the campy dance number in the archeological museum amused me and impressed me both at the same time.

The Technicolor cinematography is excellent; and it is my understanding that this was one of the first films, if not the first, to ever be filmed at least partly on location in New York City. The choreography will never cease to amaze you and hold your attention; I couldn't believe how fast Ann Miller could spin around like a top as she danced her way through one of several gigantic and splashy song and dance routines. Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra and Jules Munshin shine as they dance; and Vera-Ellen dances to perfection as well. Wow!

MGM wanted to inject some humor and some mild suspense into the plot so there is the scene in the archeological museum where an exhibit is destroyed and of course the cops begin the chase for our heroes. The car chase scene reflects careful planning and much forethought.

I completely agree with the reviewer who writes that the film allows the actors to play parts that they could excel at before they became famous for performing other types of roles. For example, Frank Sinatra DOES play a somewhat introverted soul instead of the much rougher guy or ""a heavy"" as he did in his later years.

Betty Comden and Adolph Green wrote magnificent lyrics for the songs; and the music by Leonard Bernstein could not be any better. Top notch talent!

The DVD does not come with many extras. The best ""extra"" really is the three minute theatrical trailer for the movie. You can access scenes one at a time or just view the whole movie straight through as I did. There are French subtitles, too.

Despite the many years since On The Town was filmed, this movie remains a classic musical from ""Hollywood's Dream Factory,"" MGM. I am confident that On The Town will remain a classic musical for quite some while to come as well. The dancing, the singing, the filming on location and the superlative cast all make for a timeless and somewhat sweetly sentimental masterpiece.

I highly recommend this film for fans of classic movie musicals. People who enjoy MGM musicals in particular will forgive the thin plot and love this musical forever. Great job, everyone!",1173830400,4,3179,4.718411552346571
113732,5,0790744813,"While 1952's ""Singin' in the Rain"" is definitely the more accomplished musical film, I think this buoyant 1949 classic best typifies what MGM produced during Hollywood's golden era when talents were at their peak. Co-directed by Gene Kelly and a 25-year old Stanley Donen in his feature film directing debut, the movie has a consistently propulsive energy thanks mainly to the remarkable choreography by Kelly and Donen, the seamless blend of Leonard Bernstein's familiar music with studio tunesmith Roger Edens' original compositions, and the sheer ebullience of the performers.

Written by the estimable team of Betty Comden and Adolph Green, the threadbare plot is simply about three sailors - Gabey, Chip and Ozzie - on a 24-hour leave in New York City and the women they meet and romance. Based on a subway poster, womanizing Gabey falls for Miss Turnstiles and spends his time searching for her. Phobia-ridden Ozzie finds romance with anthropology student Claire, while timid Chip is focused on sightseeing in spite of the persistent attentions of aggressive lady cab driver Hildy. The closest the story comes to dramatic tension is in the deceptions around Miss Turnstiles, who is not the big-time celebrity Gabey assumes she is but an aspiring ballerina named Ivy, who has to work nights as an exotic dancer in Coney Island.

The film is obviously at its best when it's focused on the musical sequences - beginning with the actual locations used for ""New York, New York"" in establishing the sailors' energetic arrival, continuing with the elaborate ""Prehistoric Man"" number at the Museum of Natural History and bouncing through the title tune ensemble with all six principals singing and dancing their way down from atop the Empire State Building. Everyone gets a chance to shine, though as Gabey, Gene Kelly clearly dominates with his graceful athleticism. As Chip, an overshadowed Frank Sinatra mainly gets to sing to Betty Garrett, who admirably contains her brassiness as Hildy.

Though hardly believable as an academic type, Ann Miller gets to tap impressively during ""Prehistoric Man"", and rubber-faced Jules Munshin provides mostly comedy relief as Ozzie. When dancing rather than acting to deceive Gabey, Vera-Ellen dazzles as Ivy from the fantasy-laden ""Miss Turnstiles Ballet"" to her superb duets with Kelly on ""Main Street"" and ""A Day in New York Ballet"". The only sour note is the patronizing attitude toward Hildy's squawk-voiced roommate Lucy (played with gumption by the original Gladys Kravitz from ""Bewitched"", Alice Pearce). Harold Rosson's color-saturated cinematography has been maintained quite well in the print transfer on the 2000 DVD, though the only extra is the now-battered theatrical trailer.",1162339200,4,2729,5.297921478060046
113733,5,0790744813,"Even though this is not the musical in which Gene Kelly dances with Jerry the mouse, the 1949 film ON THE TOWN still has much that is cartoonish about it--and that's not a bad thing.  It is cheerfully outlandish, in the way all the best animated cartoons of the era were.  It's one unlikely or downright absurd event after the other, and like a good Bugs Bunny short, the audience knows that suspension of disbelief goes without saying.  We delight in the absurdity.

The story of three sailors on 24-hour leave and the NYC gals they pick up during their various misadventures should logically be fast-paced, which the film certainly is, or even a little frenzied, which it is not.  Despite the crawling time-line, which should theoretically make the viewer feel as though time's a-wastin', the action almost seems suspended in time, rather than weighted down by it.  It's the old romantic notion of one day lasting forever.  And in such a magical setting, who needs to sleep?  And there can't possibly be truly serious consequences for a lady cab driver failing to turn in her car for the next shift or for that matter for destroying a dinosaur at the Museum of Natural History.

All that absurdity opens up a world of anarchic fun--just as in the best cartoons--and even the most staid of audiences can briefly escape into this loony world of antics with no consequences and true love found at the drop of a sailor's cap.

And it's all done to a great Comden-Green and Bernstein score (much taken from the Broadway play of the same name on which it is based) and handled with aplomb by its talented cast.  The casting is near perfect, with Kelly and Frank Sinatra heading an able cast of singers, dancers and comic actors.  Ann Miller and Vera-Ellen shine in their dance numbers, and Betty Garrett and Alice Pearce are remarkable for their comic--as well as their musical--timing.  Probably the only disputable casting would  be that of Sinatra as a somewhat nerdy, control freak.  But it's nice to see him out of the ""ring a ding ding"" mode for once.

ON THE TOWN's great entertainment--and like so much of the entertainment of the era expresses a joy and optimism that now seems (sadly) naive to us today.

A previous reviewer noted, in fact, that the film was emblematic of the post-WW II optimism that dominated American culture in the late 40s and early 50s.  That's for sure.  This is a world in which sailors can get in a bit of trouble (on leave) but are not about to get blown up (on duty).  And it's also a world, in which invoking military honor and sacrifice can get excuse a bit of nautical mischief.

Probably the sole bit of sobering realism is the fact that when the gobs and the gals say goodbye at the dock the next morn, they don't promise to stay in touch.  Not even Gene and Vera, who have declared true love.

The audience members can draw their own conclusions.  But with all this free floating optimism how can they conclude anything other than a romatic reunion--for all three couples?

We can suspend our disbelief on that point too.",1145750400,8,3061,4.6136783733826245
113734,4,0790744813,"One of the most enjoyable of the MGM Technicolor musicals, ON THE TOWN (1949) was produced by Arthur Freed and co-directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen.  The witty Betty Comden and Adolph Green screenplay, based on the Broadway musical, stars Kelly, Frank Sinatra, and Jules Munshin as three love-starved sailors given 24 hours shore leave in Manhattan.  The movie goes non-stop from 6:00 a.m. until the following 6:00 a.m. and benefits from a lot of rare on-location filming.

(CAUTION:  PLOT SPOILERS THROUGHOUT THIS REVIEW!)  First of all, the guys fall in love with a poster of Miss Turnstiles of the Month (Vera-Ellen) in the subway, then find her for real and do not let her out of their sight.  Kelly is paired off with her for some sensational dances.  Sinatra sets his sights on a lady taxi driver (a wonderful Betty ""Come Up to My Place"" Garrett) as the gang heads to the Museum of Natural History.  There, Munshin moons over anthropologist Ann Miller (""Modern Man"").  Before you know it, the gang is doing ""New York, New York"" on top of the NBC Building in Rockefeller Center, with its spectacular aerial view of Manhattan.  (The gone World Trade Center towers were not even built yet.)

ON THE TOWN boasts rich color and imaginative production design as we move into nighttime.  The sextette meets on top of the Empire State Building at dusk, then in a hilarious series of restaurants with waiters fawning over Miss Turnstiles, and finally Coney Island in the middle of the night and a nutty police escort on the Brooklyn Bridge in the pre-dawn hours.  (The dinosaur has collapsed at the Museum of Natural History.)  Fear not, though, there is a happy and romantic ending (a reprise of ""New York, New York"") to this tuneful and rather underrated musical delight.  The six actors have seldom been better or more charming.  (Reviewed from videocassette)",1127692800,4,1866,4.839116719242902
113735,5,0790744813,"This exhilarating musical comedy, featuring (respectively) the fancy footwork and infectious crooning of GIs Kelly and Sinatra, perfectly captures the optimistic spirit that held sway in the post-World War II boom. Co-starring dancers Vera-Ellen and Ann Miller, ""On the Town"" was one of the first color films shot on location in Manhattan, and remains one of the grandest, liveliest Hollywood musicals ever made.",1125964800,2,412,5.555555555555555
113736,5,0790744813,"The brilliance of this film is, more than anything else, its energetic, frenzied story and adaptation. Sailors-on-leave movies have been done in the past, but few have been done with this level of exuberance. As a result, the film is upbeat but not always perfect (it slows down in pace in the last 25 minutes, and the re-hash of the plot in the Kelly 'art ballet' is totally unnecessary). But there are unforgettable moments as well: shots of the old Brooklyn Navy Yard which bookend the film; the ravishing opening number/music video of ""New York, New York;"" the couples reunions on the rooftop of the Empire State Building in Act 2; and ongoing suspense maintained by a crawling timestrip which always reminds the viewer of the remaining time left. Plot-wise, it's a circus: Kelly meeting, than losing sight of, poster girl Vera-Ellen is a perfect springboard for the day-long cab chase which unites Frank Sinatra with the rambunctious Betty Garrett, stopping en route to bring Jules Munshin together with Ann Miller (who performs an electrifying, leg-displaying, tap number in the film's best song, ""Prehistoric Man""). By the time the sextet has sung ""On The Town"" from the roof to the lobby of the Empire State Building, 60 minutes have passed and the film's lighter than air pace comes to a grinding halt. At that point, it doesn't matter. You might as well sit back for the rest of the ride. Get the DVD and dream of old New York.",1115856000,3,1437,4.775100401606426
113737,5,0790744813,"One of the most familiar images of an MGM musical would be Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, and Jules Munshin dressed as sailors singing the catchy words ""New York New York's A wonderful town; The Bronx is up and the Battery's down; the people ride in a hole in the ground; New York New York: It's a wonderful town."" While the song by Leonard Bernstein is from a Broadway musical called ON THE TOWN, it is MGM's adaptation (Broadway lovers may refer to it a usurpation) that makes the song immortal today.

ON THE TOWN tells the story of three sailors: the lovable, somewhat cocky, but sincere Gabey (Gene Kelly), his clueless friend Chip (played by Frank Sinatra), and the bumbling Ozzie (Jules Munshin) who are on leave in New York City for a day. The three take a taxi where the driver Hilde (Betty Garrett) falls madly in love with Chip. She wants to ditch the other two sailors to be with her new found love, but the Chip will not abandon his two friends. Ozzie finds love when visiting the museum of natural history when he meets the intellectual Claire (Ann Miller). Gabey has yet to find the love of his life, a woman he knows only as ""Miss Turnstiles"" from a subway poster. He believes she is a famous New York celebrity, but discovers she is a hometown girl. There are also antics that would seem silly to a moviegoer today. The taxi company believes the taxi has been stolen. A skeleton of a dinosaur is damaged at the museum. A police chase ensues. Still, MGM, a studio that turned making unbelievable worlds into reality into an art form, does the same with this film.

There are many reasons this film is considered a classic. While most of the musical numbers from the original Broadway score were believed to be too sophisticated for movie musical audiences and replaced with what some consider inferior music (MGM's Saul Chaplin once said looking back he could hardly believe that Bernstein's music was replaced), somehow the score does work. The dancing numbers are great. Much of the film (a radical idea at the time) was shot on location which makes the city almost a character in the film. Vera-Ellen fans love this film because it showcases her talent. BEWITCHED fans will also enjoy the performance of Alice Pearce as Lucy Shmeeler, Hilde's unlucky in love and chronic cold suffering roommate and back-up romantic partner for Gabey.

This DVD is a just the film and its special features include just a trailer of the movie. It's a fun movie to watch and brings a viewer back to a time when the world was changing and a sense of optimism was real.",1113955200,11,2563,4.591703056768559

Maybe an interview from the archives (Sinatra, Garrett, Vera-Ellen or Kelly must have said something about this film in a TV interview). Even a film historian could have added some depth to the work. Films like this won't be seen again so why release the movie with a special features list that barely covers the talent involved?

113740,5,0790744813,"'On the Town' was the best example in 1949 that MGM's Freed Unit had ever produced of the 'integrated musical'. Song, dance and plot are woven tightly together in a way that seems more natural than ever before.

When 'On the Town' premiered, the line went all the way around the block at Radio City Music Hall. It was an outstanding success.

I think for this movie you do need a particular sense of humor. The number 'Prehistoric Man' in particular can lead certain fans of other musicals to bewilderment with its sillyness... however, it's all good fun and all in the name of 'entertainment'. *gulps*.

The movie is light hearted, eye catching (the first one shot on location in New York City) and fast paced. Any fans of Kelly and Sinatra need to see it, as well as fans of the musical comedy.

I'm not out to defy all those people who think its a second rate musical, I'd just like to say that I've watched it many times and the more I see it the more I love it.

113745,3,0790744813,"Although Kelly, Donen, and Comden/Green would go on to movie greatness together (""Singing in the Rain"", 1952) this one comes up short.  The problem is simple: MGM didn't respect the original material enough (the Bernstein/Comden/Green Broadway musical of the same name)-- most of the fine Bernstein songs were jettisoned in favor of distinctly second-rate stuff (""Main Street"", ""You're Awful"", etc.), as well as dumping all the great dance numbers save two (""A Day in New York"", ""Miss Turnstiles"").  The other problem is that after Gabey, Ivy, and their friends finally get together atop the Empire State Building, the movie really goes downhill; the whole denouement at Coney Island is silly and takes much too long.  There are some good performances, esp. from the women (Betty Garrett and Ann Miller really give the movie oomph and a sense of fun, and Alice Pearce's ""I got the gargle!"" bit is classic). Sinatra and Kelly are fine as always,  but you have to be a big Jules Munshin fan to weather his supershticky performances, both here and in ""Take me Out to the Ball Game"" (also with Sinatra, Kelly, and Garrett).
I know this movie is a big fan favorite; I just hope that people who think On the Town is a fine musical take the time to check out the really superior products of MGM's famous Freed unit: ""Singing in the Rain"", ""Gigi"", ""Meet me in St. Louis"".

Ann Miller shines in her ""Prehistoric Man"" number, one of the best to showcase her talents.  And Gene Kelly, well, he's Gene Kelly.
Do I really have to elaborate on that.  The cast also includes the comedy of Jules Munshin and Betty Garrett, the dancing talents of the lovely Vera Ellen, and, of course, the riot-inducing crooning of a pre Rat Pack Frank Sinatra.  The plot (three sailors on a twenty-four hour leave) is somewhat thin, but the musical numbers more than make up for that.  I've never seen or heard the original play, but I understand they cut quite a few of the original numbers out and changed some others.

Ann Miller has a  big dance number in a museum that really showcases her talent as a dancer.  Betty Garrett is hilarious as a cab driver who develops an immediate crush on Frank Sinatra.

Of course, by the time this film was made in 1949, MGM knew it would work, as it had for them many times previously; there was no guess work involved.  The result this time around was ""On The Town,"" a lively musical which marked the directorial debut of co-directors Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, with Kelly starring and also doing the choreography.  The plot is simple:  Three sailors get twenty-four-hour shore leave in New York and set off to make the most of it.  Chip (Frank Sinatra) wants to see the sights; Ozzie (Jules Munshin) wants to play; and Gabey (Kelly) immediately falls into an obsession over a girl he sees on a subway poster, ""Miss Turnstiles"" of the month, Ivy Smith (Vera-Ellen), and vows to find her.  Along the way they run into a quirky cab driver, Brunhilde (Betty Garrett), and a young woman, Claire (Ann Miller), doing some research at a museum.

 Kelly and Donen bring it all to life through the words and music of Betty Comden, Adolph Green and Leonard Bernstein, and the score, which earned an Oscar for Roger Edens and Lennie Hayton.  it kicks off with Sinatra, Munshin and Kelly doing ""New York, New York,"" in which they enlighten you to the fact that ""The Bronx is up and the Battery's down, and people ride in a hole in the ground--""  a dynamite opening that sets the stage for all that comes after.  And it's pure entertainment that just sweeps you away with it while you hum along with the six stars of the show as they do what they do best, and it's a delight from beginning to end.
 Without a doubt, Kelly emerges as the star among the stars, and his solo numbers and the ones he performs with Vera-Ellen are especially engaging; but this is one of those musicals in which one memorable number follows another, with each of the principals getting their own moment in the spotlight.  Vera-Ellen has a great number early on in the film, in which Miss Turnstiles is introduced; Ann Miller taps her way through a rousing routine in the museum (in which she is joined by Sinatra, Munshin, Kelly and Garrett) that really gives her a chance to show her stuff; and Sinatra and Garrett engage in a memorable bit in song, as she attempts to get him to ""Come Up To My Place.""  Through it all, Sinatra exudes a certain boyish charm while Garrett and Munshin provide the comic relief.  All of which makes for a fun and thoroughly entertaining movie experience.
 The supporting cast includes Alice Pearce (Lucy), Sid Melton (Spud), Hans Conried (Francois) and Florence Bates (Madame Dilyovska).  Some movies are made simply to transport you to another place for a couple of hours, put a smile on your face, a song on your lips and just make you feel good; and ""On The Town"" is certainly one of them.  This is pure, uplifting and satisfying Entertainment, beautifully crafted and delivered and guaranteed to make your day a little brighter.  The fact is, they just don't make `em like this anymore, and it's a shame.  Because this is what the magic of the movies is all about.",1007510400,20,3415,4.6115702479338845

En route to find Gabey's  (Kelly) dream girl, Miss Turnstiles of the month, Ivy Smith (Vera-Ellen),  he and Ozzie (Jules Munshin) and Chip (Frank Sinatra) encounter a  ready-for-love cab driver, Brunhilde (""Hildy"") Esterhazy (Betty  Garrett), and Claire Huddeson, a tap-dancing anthropologist (Ann Miller).

The film has the kind of look you never get tired of seeing: every shot beautifully composed and in jaw-droppingly  beautiful COLOR! The DVD transfer should elicit the same response that the  disc of ""The Wizard of Oz"" does. It looks absolutely  spectacular.
As far as audio is concerned, there are no complaints here  either. The sound is so good, you never once wish it were stereo.
For  those unfamiliar with the movie, the cast speaks for itself, and the  lesser-known Jules Munshin and Alice Pearce are worthy of the company of  the giant stars. There are so many enjoyably choreographed numbers, but  those taking place atop the Empire State Building might be the most  memorable.
Musically, this show does offer a few disappointments. Most of  the wonderful songs from the original Bernstein score were eschewed in  favor of newly composed ones by Roger Edens. There is a stylistic clash  between the two composers that, if not bothersome, is certainly noteworthy.  The Edens songs just don't have the melodic sophistication of the Bernstein  ones. ""You Can Count On Me"" is perhaps the best Eden song, but  all numbers benefit from the terrific Comden and Green lyrics. And when  performers are really on top of the material, as in ""You're  Awful"", any minor limitations are transcended by the pure pleasure of  hearing a clever lyric delivered by experts.
For this viewer, the single  best thing about ""On The Town"" is the astoundingly beautiful use  of New York locations. This film has captured the city at the peak of 1940s  charm and excitement. It can be enjoyed on a purely visual level in a way  few other films can.

Hot Toasty Rag, September 14, 2017

Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra fall in love with local girls while on a brief shore leave in On the Town. Whats that? Youve seen that movie already? Yes, I know, it sounds awfully similar to Anchors Aweigh, but this one is slightly different. For one, in addition to Gene and Frankie, On the Town features Jules Munshin as a third sailor on leave, the same actor who joined the pair in Take Me Out to the Ball Game. Also, Kathryn Grayson, the love interest in Anchors Aweigh, is replaced by Vera-Ellen, Ann Miller, and Betty Garrett. And finally, Gene Kelly doesnt dance with a mouse in this one.

Instead of the famous Gene and Jerry dance sequence, On the Town features the well-known title song New York, New York, Prehistoric Man, and Youre Awful. While there are some memorable moments from the movie, its not one I choose to watch over and over againeven though Gene and Frankie look adorable in their uniforms. The troubles are Ann Miller and Betty Garrett. Ann Miller was a famous dancer, and Im not going to dis her talent, but I really didn't like her. I didn't like her style, her expressions, or her attitude. Betty Garrett is unappealing, obnoxious, and reminds me of Celeste Holms more annoying sister.

I do love Vera-Ellen, though, so at least one of the three love interests doesnt make my skin crawl. If you love Gene Kelly, or young Frank Sinatra, youll probably want to see On the Town and Anchors Aweigh, since a few famous songs came out of them.",1505347200,,1524,4.534545454545454
