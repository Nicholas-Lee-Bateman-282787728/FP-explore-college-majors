8375943,5,B002OCV7RM,"I watched this series back to front after they showed Three Men Go to Ireland on Australian television recently. It was obvious the one in Ireland wasn't the first of the series, so I checked Amazon to see what else was available and ended up buying both Three Men in a Boat and Three Men in Another Boat. I thoroughly enjoyed all 3 adventures but I think I liked the first one best. I loved the easy pace and the laughs in all three, but in the first I loved the history along the Thames River more than the others. Three Men in a Boat was about three friends in a boat who took us along for the ride. It was great fun.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-Society-Secret-Baby-Silhouette-Desire/dp/0373730349/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High-Society Secret Baby (Silhouette Desire)</a>",1288915200,6,828,5.376923076923077
