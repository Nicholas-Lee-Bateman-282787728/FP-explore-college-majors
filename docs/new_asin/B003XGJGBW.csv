8408128,5,B003XGJGBW,"This DVD blew me away. First there is the top-rate instruction - well structured, well filmed, and concisely explained. On top of that, the images being produced are gorgeous and diverse. It's worth it alone just to watch Joe Weatherly draw - he's quick, decisive, and always true to the nature of the animal being portrayed. I can't stop drawing since watching this.",1370476800,2,367,4.841269841269841
8408129,5,B003XGJGBW,"Joe has devoted his life to this subject. You most likely have not. Like me. Don't re invent the wheel people staring up animal drawing thing that animal have backwards knees, dogs have collar bones. The think eyes always face frontwards, that Niels don't have fingers and , a hoof if a foot. Be ready to learn all that though need to know about the truth about how every animal has be constricted, designed, or if you like evolved in to the perfect machine. You will be able to relate to animals far better. You need this kind of understanding before you go a zoo and draw. You need to relate to what you draw and Joe cam help you do that. I have never met him, my friend Phil introduced me to his work and I am still learning from this DVD . I have be in the animation business 13 years as a concept artist and I am alway happy when a new book or DVD can move me to the next level. This book can do that for you.",1367625600,2,914,4.027472527472527
8408130,5,B003XGJGBW,"There have been so many classes, tutorials, books etc on animal drawing but they're all subpar compared to this top notch instructional tool on the art of animal drawing. Animal studies from life remains one of the hardest disciplines to date, not many even step up to the plate and for those who do only a small percentage succeed. Well, this DVD is a MUST HAVE for anyone accepting such a challenge as animal drawing. Many books can tell us what to do, what to look for how to approach etc but this DVD SHOWS us the way. By watching this master draftsman do an animal drawing and study from start to finish while discussing his techniques and approaches is a truly gifted sight. A sight that will not only amaze you but also start you on your way to also becoming a highly skilled and professional animal artist. Take advantage of the fact that Joe Weatherly even put out this DVD as many artists do not know how to produce such a well crafted medium of instruction. He is by far the BEST ANIMAL DRAWING TEACHER of the current time. I recommend this DVD to EVERY ARTIST, both amateur and professional.",1281657600,10,1103,4.465346534653466
