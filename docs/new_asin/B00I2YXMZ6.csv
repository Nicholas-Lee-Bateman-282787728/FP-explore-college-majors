6247939,5,B00I2YXMZ6,"I had never heard of Monster Math Squad but took a chance on so many episodes for such a good price and I'm glad I did. I teach kindergarten and this was exactly what I was looking for for my students. The segments are short, about 12 minutes or so, and they each reinforce a useful math concept. My students find it engaging and can always tell me something they learned from the monsters' adventures. They love it and find it a special treat to watch. I recommend it as an introduction or recap of math lessons in kindergarten.  I'll use it throughout the year.",1412467200,5,563,4.3619047619047615

6247944,5,B00I2YXMZ6,My 5 year old just loves these kinds of tools to help her learn math concepts.  It's so much fun that she doesn't even realize she is learning.  What more could you ask?

6247956,5,B00I2YXMZ6,"My 11 month older daughter is obsessed with this cartoon and it is the only cartoon she will continuously watch without getting bored (which comes in handy as a sleep deprived, working mom who sometimes needs a little time to wash dishes, clean, cook, etc). I first found this on Netflix when she was about 5 months old and she has been a fan ever since. Im sure it has everything to do with the bright colors and music/sounds that go along with it. Ive tried many other cartoons from My Little Pony to Strawberry Shortcake to all those Nickelodeon and Disney toons - but Monster Math is the only one she doesnt start fussing at. Highly recommend!",1452470400,,647,4.491525423728813
