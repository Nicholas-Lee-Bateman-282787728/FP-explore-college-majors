2521409,4,B000EHSVU0,"As popular and enduring as the television staple ""The Untouchables"" was and is, it is interesting to note that it was not the first weekly program about the Prohibition Era to air on American network television. ""The Lawless Years"" (which ran on NBC from 1959 to 1961) managed to premiere shortly before Robert Stack made Eliot Ness a household name.

Desilu Productions obtained the rights to the wildly exaggerated biography of Ness (co-written with Oscar Fraley), while ""The Lawless Years"" relied upon the memoirs of a former police detective. James Gregory, a talented character actor, who had previously appeared opposite Rod Steiger and Fay Spain in the Allied Artists motion picture production of ""Al Capone,"" portrayed Barney Ruditsky. Ruditsky was a veteran member of the New York Police Department's special gangster squad.

After retiring from the NYPD, Ruditsky left New York for California and operated a private detective agency and a Los Angeles area nightclub, where Mickey Cohen raised hell on one occasion. Ruditsky became something of a studio mascot in Hollywood, conducting investigations on stars and contract players alike. His most celebrated assignment found him keeping tabs on the unfaithful Marilyn Monroe for her jealous husband, ""Jolting Joe"" DiMaggio. Ruditsky even made bit role appearances in two movies as (what else?) a police officer. Unlike the actual Eliot Ness, who died before ""The Untouchables"" achieved success as a best selling book and a popular weekly television series, Ruditsky lived long enough to enjoy a measure of renewed recognition. He was employed as a technical advisor on ""The Lawless Years."" He died in 1962.

What differentiated ""The Lawless Years"" from ""The Untouchables,"" in addition to its New York setting, as opposed to Chicago, was its half hour format. With less than thirty minutes per episode, if one subtracts commercial breaks, the scripts had to be tighter and the plotting more compact. Gregory usually opened the program with a slide projector and performed narrative duties to set up the weekly episode. Gregory's introductory and concluding law and order speeches were decidedly straight forward and much less hyperbolic than Walter Winchell's.

To a certain degree, there is a greater amount of realism in ""The Lawless Years"" than in ""The Untouchables."" Scripts on the Robert Stack series were sometimes approved and sometimes censored by J. Edgar Hoover. In contrast, on ""The Lawless Years"" series, the police did not always succeed in solving crimes. Cops are poorly paid and overworked. The police department lacked resources. Bad guys were not always apprehended and punished. Police interrogation techniques sometimes bordered upon official brutality (suggested at, but seldom shown on screen). Ruditsky personally threatens suspects and throws punches as often as he shoots. Venal politicians and fatuous departmental bureaucrats routinely interfere in police business. Real names are used for many New York gangsters and politicians.

Veteran Hollywood screenwriter Jo Eisinger, whose film credits included ""Gilda"" and ""Night and the City,"" provided nine scripts for the program. Gregory's usual police partner on the series was Max Fields, played by Robert Karnes. Karnes had supporting roles in many film noir genre movies. Together Fields and Ruditsky played the ""Mutt and Jeff,"" good cop, bad cop routine on many suspects.

The guest performers, include many familiar faces such as Ted De Corsia, Milton Frome, Martin Landau, Harry Dean Stanton, Jack Kruschen, Walter Sande, Barry Kelley and others. While the former RKO studio lot was utilized on ""The Untouchables"" series, ""The Lawless Years"" was filmed on the well maintained Metro Goldwyn Mayer back lot, which was certainly more than adequate.

Two interesting episodes stood out so much that I opted to briefly summarize both:

From season one, ""The Morrison Story"" develops an interesting scenario about the unsolved investigation concerning disappearance of a prominent state court judge (Philip Coolidge) that closely resembles the actual mystery of Judge Joseph F. Crater who simply vanished without a trace in 1930. The reform activities of the Seabury investigative commission figure in the proceedings as do the strenuous damage control efforts of fearful political bosses and stooges from Tammany Hall. The speculative explanation as to how the jurist passed from the mortal realm is well thought out.

The premiere episode from season two is ""The Al Brown Story."" The title refers to the alias of a thug who goes from shaking down and terrorizing tobacco vendors to working as a low level subordinate to Frankie Yale, the notorious Brooklyn crime boss. Ruditsky pursues the ambitious punk without success as ""Brown"" manages to avoid arrest by boarding a train bound for Illinois. Once in Chicago, the hoodlum becomes better known by his actual name, Al Capone.

Jackie Weston's portrayal is quite an interesting departure from the usual screen depictions of the Al Capone. Many other actors have emphasized Capone's volatile, hair trigger temper and his willingness to resort to violence, but Weston, who plays the gangster at a more youthful age, shows that he was capable of behaving like cowardly weasel and a lying sneak. Weston's Capone is a cunning rat who prefers to intimidate weaker and more vulnerable people (while vandalizing a tobacco store by destroying its cigar inventory with acid -- a typical racketeering ploy at one time -- Capone maliciously burns its blind proprietor with the vitriol). This is a truthful if forgotten and overlooked performance. Capone's biographers often omit to mention how often the devious ""Big Fellow"" went into hiding to avoid his rivals. It is no secret that he chose to strike down most of his opponents by employing various forms of  subterfuge.

For a brief time, there were three programs set in the Twenties on network television: the success of ""The Untouchables"" inspired Desilu to create another series, ""The Roaring Twenties,"" which was more of a comedic program which looked at the bootlegging period from the lighthearted perspective of flappers and newspaper men.

The first two seasons of ""The Lawless Years"" are available for purchase. The third and final year of the series has been discontinued by the manufacturer. One word for DVD collectors, the distributors of the series chose to tint the black and white episodes. The images will appear to be either green or sepia toned depending upon your television playback equipment. Each DVD contains one entire season's worth of episodes.",1240963200,5,6598,5.320537428023033

2521412,4,B000EHSVU0,"This DVD set actually contains all the episodes of THE LAWLESS YEARS that aired during its initial TWO season network run: nineteen episodes of season #1 and the eight that comprised season #2, which was suspended halfway through, probably due to poor ratings. Eighteen months after this enforced hiatus, ""The Lawless Years"" returned for a second go-round-- this time lasting 20 weeks, most of those during the summer of 1961.

THE LAWLESS YEARS was broadcast on the NBC-TV network at 8 pm, starting in April of 1959. Based on the memoirs of detective Barney Ruditsky (who was also the program's consultant), ""The Lawless Years"" is set in Prohibition-era America. Starring as Ruditsky is James Gregory with co-star Robert Karnes as Max Fields.

2521413,3,B000EHSVU0,the stories were entertaining.the problem was the quality of the tape. it got stuck at times and I could not finish a few episodes,1184630400,3,130,4.458333333333333
2521414,5,B000EHSVU0,"For those who are waiting for The Untouchables to come out on DVD (don't hold your breath!)here is something almost as satisfying--The Lawless Years.  It's only a half hour show, and there's less 'violence', but this show definitely has the same flavor of the times as The Untouchables and James Gregory is superb as Gangster Squad detective, Barney Ruditsky.  In fact, many of the best character actors of the early 60s who have appeared on The Untouchables also guest star on The Lawless Years.  However, Robert Stack does NOT make an appearance as Eliot Ness.  That would have been perfect since James Gregory has guest starred on The Untouchables, but the person who wrote that is mistaken.

I hope  the second season of this show will soon be released, it's well worth it.  You won't be disappointed with this one, they cover all the gangsters of the era, though some names have been changed, but you will be able to guess who they are.

Don't let the garish sepia tone (more burnt orange than sepia) keep you away from viewing this show.  Perhaps they tinted it  to distinguish it from the crisp black and white noir of The Untouchables.  But you will get so absorbed in the show you will soon get used to the unusual color tint.",1149120000,18,1235,4.6192660550458715
2521415,4,B000EHSVU0,"During the mid-1950s to early 1960s, California National Productions was the NBC television network's in-house production arm.  According to IMDB.com, California National was responsible for the production of about a dozen television series, most of which lasted a season or two at best, and are now largely forgotten.  Among those was ""The Lawless Years,"" a crime series set in New York City during the prohibition years.  James Gregory stars as real-life cop Barney Ruditsky, with the real Ruditsky serving as the series' technical adviser.  Each episode (produced for a 30 minute time slot) featured the story of a different gangster.  There are plenty of up and coming actors and familiar faces in the weekly stories.  For example, the first episode features Vic Morrow, Jan Merlin, and Harry Dean Stanton.  In addition to Gregory, Robert Karnes, as Ruditsky's associate Max Fields, is the only other regular in the series.  Interestingly, this series debuted about six months prior to the similarly themed, but better known and more popular crime series ""The Untouchables,"" which told the story of Eliot Ness' exploits in Chicago.

It's difficult to give this DVD release from the Timeless Media Group a full five star rating, but one has to give them credit for taking a chance on releasing this relatively obscure show that's been little seen since its original broadcasts.  There are some issues with the visual quality of the presentation, chief of which is a yellow/sepia tint that was apparently added at some point after the series' prime-time run (in black & white).  I can only assume that the producers must have felt that the tinting of the shows would help it later on in syndication as television transitioned from black & white to color in the mid-1960s.  Regardless, the tinting is distracting but can easily be removed by adjusting the color on your television set.  What you're left with are relatively clean and defect-free prints, though they are a little ""soft"" looking and don't have the crisp resolution often found on shows from the same era released by the major studios.  But once you correct the tinting issue, the episodes are very watchable.

This series will very likely appeal to fans of ""The Untouchables"" (still ""missing in action"" on DVD as of this writing), as well as anyone interested in period crime dramas.  My rating is closer to *** & 1/2 due to the good, but not great, visual presentation.",1143158400,10,2436,4.992574257425742
2521416,4,B000EHSVU0,"The late 50s and early 60s were crowded with Prohibition gangster films and television shows. The most famous televison series of this type was THE UNTOUCHABLES with Robert Stack, but other TV shows included such lost gems as THE ROARING 20s and THE LAWLESS YEARS, starring James Gregory (Matt Helm's boss in three Dean Martin movies) as real life New York police lieutenant Barney Rudensky. As in the Robert Stack series taking place in Frank Nitti's Chicago, James Gregory confronted many historic New York mobsters, including Dutch Schultz, Legs Diamond and Charlie ""Lucky"" Luciano. These shows are filled with guest stars from that era and packed with blazing tommy gun action, sadistic extortion, loose women, mob rubouts and justice triumphant at the end of the episode. In one episode from the first season Robert Stack as Elliot Ness even makes a guest appearance. While THE UNTOUCHABLES this is not, it is the best substitute you will find until that classic is finally released. THE LAWLESS YEARS is far better than most of the police shows currrently released from the 1970s, 80s and 90s and deserves more attention than Amazon is currently giving it, without even an image or description. James Gregory is one of the finest character actors in the business and his Barney Rudensky is the kind of deadpan role he excelled at. If you miss Prohibition, bathtub gin, burley queens and tough cops who never heard of Miranda, then you can't miss this great show. And 27 hour-long episodes is a bargain you can't refuse.",1141689600,19,1525,4.937743190661479

I like the sepia and white, myself, but that is a matter of taste.  It is pretty cool to see current, well-known (old) guest actors in their youth, (Harry)Dean Stanton, Burt Reynolds, etc. There are some actresses who I have never heard of giving some very good performances here as well, as various hard-boiled dames, molls, and so on.
