5851715,3,B00DRTNFEY,"I was hoping this would be in 'widescreen' but it is still fullscreen, just like the previous copy.  Therefore, there's nothing improving about this copy, just the same as the previous copy only worse since it doesn't contain the tv special of the 'mirage pokemon', which I wouldn't mind missing if only this was WIDESCREEN.

I do like the case and artwork since it's not a box, because when the art work is on a box case, the art cover gets worn and ruin, when in this case this artwork is covered by the plastic to keep the artwork from getting ruined, and when the plastic gets worn out, I can take the artwork out and put it in a replacement case, which can still look fresh and new.

I do liked this Pokemon movie, like most of the Pokemon movies, I thought they were good.  I ONLY wish that this movie would be released in WIDESCREEN, then I would be satisfied.  Of course, I would be interested in seeing the Japanese cut.",1390435200,,929,4.3468208092485545

5851717,5,B00DRTNFEY,"My daughter tells me that this is her favorite Pokemon movie. She is 13 years old and watches the TV show six days a week. According to her, this movie is an epic and moving adventure. Not to be missed if you are a Pokemon Trainer.",1382227200,,231,4.043478260869565
5851718,5,B00DRTNFEY,"My personal opinion is that this film is the best out of all 15 so far released. My hope, however, is that this time, the film will be presented in its original widescreen aspect ratio. The previous release may have contained the bonus TV special, but the film was presented in full screen. If it's not widescreen, don't bother purchasing.",1373155200,,339,4.666666666666667

5851727,4,B00DRTNFEY,"Mew is my favorite Pokemon, by far. That's primarily why I bought this movie, because I hadn't seen it before. I was pleasantly suprised by the story and supporting characters. This movie was well done, not like some of the newer movies that are just crap. I recommend this movie to all Pokemon fans, you won't be disappointed.

5851732,5,B00DRTNFEY,"Very good movie! However, I don't think the Mew from Pokemon the First Movie is the Mew in this movie. It wasn't the best of the Pokemon series, but it certainly wasn't the worst.",1465948800,,179,4.294117647058823

5851739,3,B00DRTNFEY,"This is easily one of the more popular DVDs we have as prizes at our arcade.  Having watched it personally, I'd say it's about as good as any other Pokemon movie.  It definitely has a very heavy focus on Lucario.  The other pokemon barely even make an appearance here.  For once, this doesn't have Pikachu following Ash everywhere.  It instead develops a bond between Lucario & Ash, as Lucario sees Ash's aura is identical to his old master.  The plot is a little nonsensical, though.  Lucario's a big fan favorite though, so it definitely delivers lots of Lucario for you.",1456790400,2,573,4.67

5851745,5,B00DRTNFEY,"Most Pokemon movies just try to show off new legendaries and have the same plot rehashed to fit said legendaries. This is not the case with Lucario and the Mystery of Mew. This movie is by far the best of the franchise due to it's amazing characters and unique story. And for the price you definitely won't hear me complain. It arrived super fast, I sat down to watch it the day it came, and I enjoyed every minute of it. Great movie, great price!",1436227200,,447,4.270588235294118

Lucario is one of my favorite pokemon ever and this may be one of the reasons why, he's the best thing in this movies besides his Master Arron. Mew is a bonus. I think it is a good kid film. I don't feel dumber after watching it at least. lol",1428796800,,391,4.0256410256410255

5851775,5,B00DRTNFEY,"While having a movie based on lucario is already great, And yet maybe not the best movie ever by all means. So far this is my personal favorite. One of my favorite things about the movie is the music. The intro is even great to watch. The voice acting while good in some places can sometimes get grating and annoying at parts, if you can get past that you should be just fine. The drama is indeed played actually pretty well in this movie. And finaly as it takes place in the pokemon world I absolutely enjoyed it as a kid and still like it today. If you want a great looking movie and enjoy the world around it. pick it up and see for yourself.",1402272000,4,645,4.126984126984127
5851776,5,B00DRTNFEY,"Personally, my favorite is Destiny Deoxys but this is a close second! The plot is great but not too complicated the the kids would get lost. It is one of the more action packed Pokemon movies. I recommend this for any fan of the series, you will not be disappointed!",1393804800,6,266,4.34

8596899,2,B00DRTNFEY,"Not a terrible movie, but nothing happens for the first hour (which is two thirds of the movie). The first hour is just dancing, chatting, taking baths in hot springs, and Lucario whining and being depressed. The last 30 minutes is pretty good.

This isn't a bad rent if you're on a Pokemon movie binge, but it wasn't as good as I thought it would be (considering many think it's the best of the movies). There's not a whole lot of direction here. No main villain, no overarching quest/story or goal, it's just kind of meh.",1505433600,,523,4.447916666666667

8596904,5,B00DRTNFEY,This is one of the better Pokmon movies. We own the first 10 movies as well as seasons 1-4. Some of the movies just aren't as entertaining as the first few movies or the show.
