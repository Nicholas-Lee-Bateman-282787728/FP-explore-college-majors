876277,5,6304354371,The def comedy jam was even funnier than I thought it would be and I have viewed it several times now.,1356220800,,102,3.9047619047619047
876278,5,6304354371,These DVDs are very funny and this is prolly one of the funniest ones. Highly recommend it to comedy lovers,1355788800,,107,4.4
876279,5,6304354371,I haven't gotten a chance to see this dvd just yet due to the holidays but this is one to own it's a classic,1354579200,,108,3.5416666666666665
876280,5,6304354371,"This is a funny DVD with lots of laughter you will bust a gut, Bernie Mac is the best ever",1344556800,,90,3.55
876281,5,6304354371,"The Def Comedy Jam series is the funniest comedy DVD ever. I see now why Russell Simmons is a very rich man. No one can make me laugh like my own people. Comedy is universal, but I can relate to the situations some of these comics talk about and that makes it even more hilarious. This was a great purchase.",1264896000,,307,4.133333333333334
876282,5,6304354371,Purchased for someone but of course I watched it too.  Laugh out loud funny.  Just doesn't get any better.  R.I.P. Bernie Mac,1219881600,3,125,4.590909090909091
876283,4,6304354371,"I initially bought this DVD because of Martin Lawrence. Ive seen alot of his films and thought they were funny. But i still thought him and will smith could not be the only black american comedians america has because in england all we have on terrestial TV(of black american comedy) are old re-runs of The Fresh Bel Air. So i purchased it wanting to discover more. In England we only have white comedy shows and although some of them are funny, I can not relate fully to them because of the cultural barrier between white english people and second generation african english culture.
In this DVD there are 3 shows:
One hosted by Martin Lawrence, the second by Chris Rock and the third Cedric the entertainer.
The first show is so funny all the comedians had me cracking up, and Bernie Mac had me in stitches. I would buy a DVD with just this show on it.
The second was OK but mostly due to the host Chris Rock. As the host he should get the audience fired up in anticpation. But he came and gave  a below par performance. It was like he had not prepared for the show like he had just been drafted in at the last minute and did not want to be there. The comedians in this show were all different but i would have to say Dominique was the worst. Her set did not flow and had no relevance. I did not laugh once in fact i had to fast forward her a few times so that i did not cringe every time she talked.
Rudy Rush was quite good, he started good but did not follow through with the jokes. The other comedian was alright but his performance gained momentum as time went on. I basically only laughed at the end.
Now the show with Cedric the entertainer was sooooooo funny. I mean Cedric is such a joker. He upheld the whole show. The comedians in the show were good but Cedric was in a league of his own he had me laughing so many times, and he didn't mention sex once as many comedians in this series love to do.",1080000000,22,1910,4.190217391304348
876284,4,6304354371,"This is a good DVD,but not as good as volume one. This DVD contains 3 episodes of HBO's groundbreaking comedy series Def Comedy Jam. The first one is hosted by Martin Lawrence,the second by Chris Rock,and the third by Cedric The Entertainer. The first show is hilarious! Every comedian is funny. Chris Tucker starts off this show. He gives a very funny performance. Kevin Anthony is next. His whole routine is about sex,but he is SOOO funny. Alonzo ""Hamburger"" Jones is next. I like the way he says ""Hamburger"" instead of a cuss word. Last,but not least,is the one and only Bernie Mac. Like Kevin Anthony,his whole routine is about sex,but he is SOO funny. In the second show,Chris Rock gave a terrible performance. He sounded like he didn't want to be there. The second comedian in this show,Dominique,is terrible also. The only famous comedian in this show is Rudy Rush. He gives a funny performance. Cedric's performance in the third show is great. Him and Mike Bonner are the only funny comedians in the show.",1065571200,9,1013,4.761363636363637
876285,4,6304354371,"From the outset Martin Lawrence starts one of the funniest comedies to date. The wide range of comedians from the unknown Chris Tucker (not anymore) to the brilliances of Bernie Mac, Cedric make this a classic. I do not have one bad thing to say about this video other than Chris Rock provided a very wack show, like he did not want to be there at all.
A great buy!!!",1035849600,10,367,4.257142857142857

7871128,1,6304354371,"I was not impressed. At all actually. The DVD I ordered was Def Comedy Jam All Stars 2, while anxiously awaiting its arrival for days it was all for naught when I received it. The case said ""All Stars 2"" but inside was the ""All Stars 5"" disc. It amazes me how such a mistake could be overlooked so easily. I chose not to send it back cuz it didn't seem worth the effort or hassle just to probably either have it happen again or to tell me they don't have the ""All Stars 2"" disc.",1476748800,,478,3.9895833333333335
