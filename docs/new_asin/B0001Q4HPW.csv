2023582,1,B0001Q4HPW,"We made the mistake of buying this DVD when we had the earlier purchased the ""other"" Cowgirl Dora, not knowing that it was simply a repackaging move.  Such a move makes no sense for kids, unless the intent is to get the parents to mistakenly purchase the DVD twice.  There is no indication, even in the mouse print on the back, that this DVD contains the identical material the old DVD contained.  It is even the same DVD in the box.  Of course, you can't tell until it is opened, so you are out of luck.

I will think twice before I buy another Nickelodeon after this experience.",1333411200,,580,4.333333333333333

2023592,2,B0001Q4HPW,"My kids and I love Dora, and as soon as a new Dora DVD comes out I purchase it. I was extremely upset to learn that this DVD is just a bunch of old episodes recycled in different packaging. The first episode, ""Pinto, the Pony Express"" is the only episode we don't already have on DVD. The other three Dora episodes are already on other DVDs. ""A letter for Swiper"" also appears in the ""Big Sister Dora DVD."" ""Choo Choo"" also appears on the ""We're a Team!"" DVD.

She likes this one very much,especially the episode with Pinto the Pony. I would have given this 5 stars were it not for the fact that the episode Letter for Swiper is also on a different Dora DVD she has at home. With all the episodes to choose from,there is really no reason for repeats. And while this DVD lists for $19.99 on Amazon,we bought it for $12.86 at Wal Mart.",1125792000,11,555,4.245283018867925
