2458099,5,B000CCZR9A,"Our 4 & 6 year old boys love the ocean and these movies help to fuel their love. We do have to watch it with them and skip the more intense scenes, but the photography is beautiful and the information well presented. The metal container is unique and protects the 6 DVDs well. This is well worth the money and will serve us for years to come.",1252195200,,342,4.119402985074627
2458100,4,B000CCZR9A,"I read the reviews for this set of movies and decided to take a chance and pick it up, figuring what's the worst that can happen.  I was pleased with the set. It has some interesting shows and nice footage of undersea animals.  The only down side is the editing, it is an older television show that has been converted to a documentary format.  The editing is a little jerky in places, sometime leaving a blank black screen.  If you are hoping for a cheaper version of Blue Planet this is probably not it.  If you are looking for a nice show at a decent price this is a good option.  I am very happy with most of the episodes.  If they would have spent a bit more time fixing the editing problems this would have been a great DVD set.",1220313600,5,733,4.156028368794326
2458101,1,B000CCZR9A,"The packaging proclaims, ""Over 10 hours of breathtaking footage."" Unfortunately, most of the series takes place on the surface via on-camera interviews, history lessons, and the explorers doing random things. Viewers hoping for abundant footage of marine life will be thoroughly disappointed. Avoid this set.",1169942400,12,308,5.866666666666666
2458102,5,B000CCZR9A,I was sceptical about this dvd set after I saw it at best buy and bought the Cousteau collection (quite a disappointment) that day. About a week later back at best buy it was on sale for $12.99 so I bought it thinking I have been wasting $13 on worst thing anyway. Got back home and put the first DVD in and it was like WOW!! I was done watching them all in less than a week. A few of the DVD are repeating part of the others but overall very nice set and for the price really no way to regret it.,1145577600,9,497,3.8349514563106797
8097744,5,B000CCZR9A,"great dvd set with collector's tin. I am very pleased with this collection, it features shipwrecks, sharks, coral reefs, and much more. My only gripe is that there were no bonus shows as on other sets. But that isn't essential so it's all good. It comes with a collector's booklet inside, although you may run across just the dvd set itself at goodwill or something. But either way it's a good investment if you like underwater scenery and nature documentaries like I do.",1487203200,,471,4.686746987951807
8097745,4,B000CCZR9A,Enjoying it quite a bit. It's watching the old Jacques Cousteau adventures.,1471132800,,75,5.333333333333333

8097747,4,B000CCZR9A,Great for Alzheimer's patient. My dad had completely stopped watching television. Last thing that he would watch was funniest home videos. He had lost interest in those even but I pop these in on a little tv plugged into a DVD player in whichever room he is in and he seems to really enjoy them. He may drift away from them for a while but the visual content will bring him back in. He is deaf but does not need sound to enjoy these. Each disk has several topics.,1426723200,,463,4.213483146067416
8097748,4,B000CCZR9A,"I bought this for my kids they will watch it if I'm watching it, but they don't go looking for it. For me, it's very informative and entertaining; filled with some of the some of the most beautiful shots over captured on film/video. If you are looking for an informative series that kids enjoy watching over and over, find the Popular Mechanics for Kids (PMK) - it's not biased, it's informative, and kids enjoy watching it. my kids will tell me a factoid and when I ask where they learned this, they say ""PMK""!!!",1426291200,,513,4.468085106382978
8097749,5,B000CCZR9A,This DVD box set was amazing to learn from. I enjoyed finding out about mysteries of the ocean.,1409961600,,95,4.333333333333333

8097752,5,B000CCZR9A,This set of DVDs encludes the treasure chest for keeping is worth much more! Awesome colors and action. Go under water  and see for yourself.,1323907200,,141,4.64
8097753,2,B000CCZR9A,"A Major negative is the very rough editing which also leads to unfinished dialog. I will jerk you out of your thoughts or experience youe in when watching. An example is cave diving, after the narration about the challenges of caving diving, there was a diver using a device to propel himself (underwater in a cave) and was watching him move around when BAM, blank screen!!  Lousy transition into how divers (on land) are asking a local if they can explore his property for more cave openings.  this is about the sixth crappy transition so far and I'm only at the beginning of the second DVD.

When there is actual underwater footage it is almost worth the hassle of the rough transitions and the fact is a LOT of the show is above water, it shows the people prepping for the dive, comments by scientist, footage of the locals and other non underwater footage. not that i was expecting all of it to be underwater (hey, why not), but it had way too many people making irrelevant comments that aren't educational or interesting.",1263168000,,1026,4.595628415300546
