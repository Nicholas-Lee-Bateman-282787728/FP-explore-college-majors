7801969,3,1935519158,"When this was announced a while ago, I placed my order intending it to be a Christmas gift for a friend.  When it arrived I was a little disappointed.  I was expecting a nice boxed set in a slipcase and what I received was just a set of the 4 DVDs shrink-wrapped together with a simple white label on the outside.  What's even more disappointing is that the ""collection"" is actually more expensive than buying the discs separately.

The DVDs themselves are awesome, but the so-called collection is a waste of money.  You're much better off just buying the discs individually.",1193788800,64,575,4.653465346534653
