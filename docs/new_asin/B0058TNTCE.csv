8462229,3,B0058TNTCE,I didn't get what was in tbe website. On this offer reads dvd...not cd..to my understanding dvd is a movie or a type of video. I ordered dvd and i got a cd.the company that sent me the merchandise agreed on sending me dvd...never got it. Amazon should contact them for misleading customers.

8462231,4,B0058TNTCE,"Since 1992 I have been collecting all Marcos Witt albums, the last one 25 Concierto conmemorativo was a little disappoint, the way they cut and edit the CD was not the right way. I read that the DVD was good so I decide to give it a shot, and for my surprise it is excellent, way much different than the CD. My only concern is that this video was not on BluRay, that's why I gave it four stars not five. My verdict is that you most buy this DVD",1325548800,3,444,3.9444444444444446
8462232,5,B0058TNTCE,I didn't know what to expect when I bought this DVD but I was gladly impressed. Going back to the old days when Marcos did his first songs was amazing. The new and fresh arrangements are really good. Watching his old bands was also a plus and all the invitees he had was just the cherry on the top. Thanks for this great concert. Fully recommended.,1322265600,2,348,4.287878787878788
