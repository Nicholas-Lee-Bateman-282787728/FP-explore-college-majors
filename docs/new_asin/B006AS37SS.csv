4981860,1,B006AS37SS,"Perhaps this is just a boring Agatha Christie, or else it was poorly made.  The pacing was awful, the casting all wrong, the suspense negligible.  Or perhaps given the Poirot and Miss Marple series having been done so superbly, other renditions pale in comparison.",1399161600,2,264,4.9772727272727275

4981877,5,B006AS37SS,Had good story line and acting,1473638400,,30,4.166666666666667
4981878,4,B006AS37SS,A surprise when we noticed this listed on Amazon Prime. We thought we had seen all the Christie films (Poirot and Marple). Not quite as good as the Marple and Poirot series but it could just be the era it was filmed in. Good show nonetheless.,1473033600,,242,4.282608695652174
4981879,3,B006AS37SS,"It is ok as Agatha Christie movies go, but it is dated and does not have the visual effects of the newer productions.  It was still great on a cold and rainy night.",1472601600,,164,3.9696969696969697
4981880,5,B006AS37SS,"At a dinner party the trophy wife of a nouveau riche old man is poisoned.  Whodunit?  Because one of the other guests was a high ranking government official, the British secret service is called in to investigate. The agents are an older couple who keep their spying a secret from their daughter and grandchild.  This is an updated version of an Agatha Christie story.  Some reviewers are complaining about the updates, but I quite liked the modern version.  There's a lot of good acting.  The secret agent couple are amusing.  All the actors are very convincing in their roles.  This movie proves you can have a good suspense filled story without a ton of violence and gore.

Note, a lot of negative reviews are coming from people who object to changes from the Agatha Christie book.  My suggestion is, watch it as if there is no connection to the original book.  Then you will like it, I think.",1468800000,,896,4.6075949367088604

4981883,4,B006AS37SS,"A thriller, seemed to be made for TV movie.  An Agatha Christie book made into a film is a classic who done it and WHY?  A wrong person ends up being the one killed.  Perfect for one of those nights when you are bored out of your mind.  It's easy to guess WHO did it but not necessarily WHY.  A sadistic type millionaire makes them all sit through a dinner party again to relive the death of his wife to find out who the killer is...might not be his best move.....",1447632000,,464,4.054945054945055

4981886,3,B006AS37SS,a good who done it.....,1437696000,,23,3.8
4981887,2,B006AS37SS,I sort of follows the book. I like a movie that follows the story line as well as the book characters. This one adds a few who don't seem like they fit in the story. They could have done a much better job. It's a shame to ruin a great book and waste so much money on a mediocre performance.  (and I liked the two sleuths--as actors. But they just didn't fit into the story.,1436140800,2,373,3.973333333333333

4981893,2,B006AS37SS,"Misses the moral and character-driven points of Agatha Christie's story. Leaving out Tony loses the love story. Colonel ""Reese"" is silly--a wife smarter than he is--compared to Colonel Race in the original. The performances were fine, but the plotting and characters were a mess. In the original ""nobody"" went near the table because waiters/workers are seen as ""nobodies""--a point AC made in many of her books. It was a waiter who misplaced Iris' handbag. The character of Rosemary was lost in this version.",1428364800,2,507,5.120481927710843
4981894,1,B006AS37SS,Could not watch it. Kept saying error.,1427673600,,38,4.571428571428571
4981895,5,B006AS37SS,"I bought the British version of this movie and loved it. It is updated from the original 'Yellow Iris' short story and has a superficial resemblance, but I loved the introduction of a 'Tommy/ Tuppence' couple and Oliver Ford Davies and Pauline Collins do a wonderful job in their parts. Unfortunately, this is only out in a stand-alone copy in Region 2, so it won't play in American/Canadian region 1 players. But I solved that problem by springing for a $50. region-free dvd player. I have made my money back in buying  from the UK, which often has a lower price for dvd's even with a heftier shipping price and a longer wait in the mails. Amazon.uk is just as customer friendly as its American counter-part and if you have a problem, they respond quickly to e-mails. This movie is also available in Agatha Christie's QUEEN OF CRIME COLLECTION, which also has a younger cast playing Tommy and Tuppence in WHY DIDN'T THEY ASK EVANS? and Cheryl Campbell in the SEVEN DIALS MYSTERY as well as SPARKLING CYANIDE. That set is put out by Acorn and is formatted in Region 1.",1426982400,3,1068,4.591623036649215
4981896,5,B006AS37SS,Well done and interesting.,1426982400,,26,5.75
4981897,5,B006AS37SS,"Wonderful recounting of a classic Agatha Christie. If you like her books and other movies based on them, this one will not disappoint you.",1425081600,,138,4.791666666666667
4981898,1,B006AS37SS,Boring.,1425081600,,7,7.0
4981899,1,B006AS37SS,Ridiculous adaptation. I don't think updating Agatha Christie is healthy or wise. I'm adapting this as a period piece and I hope you get to see the story the way Christie would want it: without facial recognition software and an interesting batch of characters. Oliver Davies was good but otherwise this version was complete rot.,1420502400,4,329,5.0
4981900,2,B006AS37SS,Married septuagenarians use CCTV video to solve the crime.  Is this what Christie wrote?,1419724800,,88,5.285714285714286
4981901,5,B006AS37SS,good movie to watch on a rainy day,1417478400,,34,3.375
4981902,4,B006AS37SS,A modern mystery. Liked the elderly couple who teamed up to solve it.,1416787200,,69,4.384615384615385
4981903,1,B006AS37SS,"This was the worst interpretation of an Agatha Christie story I have seen. If you ever want to see the real story, don't watch this.",1416009600,4,132,4.32
4981904,3,B006AS37SS,I have no idea about the movie since I never could get it to play! I'm not wasting my money purchasing movies that I can't watch.,1414800000,,129,4.0

4981907,3,B006AS37SS,Entertaining.  The only negative thing I have to say is that the female lead has a smirk on her face almost constantly and I found it distracting a little.  But a nice way to spend 90 minutes or so.,1412726400,,198,4.051282051282051
4981908,5,B006AS37SS,It's a good story that sneaks up on you. It's very updated so it isn't always Agatha-like. Nonetheless I enjoyed it.,1410307200,,116,4.571428571428571
4981909,4,B006AS37SS,I generally enjoy all AGATHA CHRISTIE.  Sparkling Cyanide is no different.  Very enjoyable.,1410307200,,91,5.923076923076923
4981910,5,B006AS37SS,"Anything of Agatha Christie is top notch. Why can't American producers come up with enjoyable mysteries without constant offensive language and over the top sex? They need to take lessons from the Brits - i.e., Inspector Morse, Lewis and Midsomer Murders. Awesome.",1409702400,17,264,5.309523809523809
4981911,5,B006AS37SS,Collins sparkles in one of christies best...,1409356800,2,44,5.428571428571429
4981912,5,B006AS37SS,It was a modern version and I was hoping for a period piece. It was well acted and the costumes were nice. If you like A.C.you'll like this.,1407974400,6,140,4.035714285714286
4981913,3,B006AS37SS,"Love anything Agatha Christie.  This had a very different modern spin on this well known plot.  It was
well acted, but plot got a bit muddled.",1407888000,,142,4.423076923076923
4981914,1,B006AS37SS,Horrible remake....should have heeded other critics! But...thought even bad BBC would be passable..Not so. Skip it.,1407801600,,115,6.25

4981919,4,B006AS37SS,"I enjoy that the British can tell a story without the swear words that have become so common here in the USA.  I find that the use of foul language doe not enhance the story for me.  Just give me a good ""who done it"" to figure out.",1402790400,17,231,3.7916666666666665
4981920,5,B006AS37SS,The story was very good. I was surprised by the outcome of who the murderer was and I really enjoyed the two main characters.,1402704000,8,125,4.25
4981921,3,B006AS37SS,"This is a nice little mystery. It doesn't reach heights nor depths, but it's good enough to while away a warm evening. I found the principle couple engaging and wouldn't mind seeing more of them as well as their bright, young computer hacker, cliched though his role might be.. The others did their jobs well, but weren't given the dialogue to go very far with their characterizations. Susan Hampshire was wasted here.",1399420800,2,418,4.819444444444445

8495807,5,B006AS37SS,This was certainly an updated version of the original Agatha Christie story but it was very well done and the plot line was close enough to still make it fun to watch. Great actors. Good mystery,1516579200,,194,4.416666666666667
8495808,5,B006AS37SS,"Love this movie!  Good cast, brilliantly led by Oliver Ford Davies & Pauline Collins. Very entertaining, with the requisite Agatha Christie plot twists & turns.",1516147200,,160,5.4
8495809,2,B006AS37SS,as a Agatha Christie fan I was extremely disappointed at this poor production of this story. It is very sad when you can pick out both the Murderer and the Victim in the first few scenes.,1497830400,,187,4.222222222222222
