Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0

 With 'Blue Jasmine', Woody Allen has managed to come up with a film that invites comparisons with one great work from theatrical history as well as a more recent true-life story, ripped from the headlines involving the financial world. He cleverly merges these two disparate stories into a fairly gripping tale that will keep your interest to the end, but eschews the complex references from his source material, which make those narratives, much more compelling.

Jasmine, Allen's anti-heroine, is obviously based on Ruth Madoff, who was married to Bernie Madoff, who committed the greatest Ponzi scheme in history. In the film, the Madoff character is 'Hal' (Alec Baldwin), a mega-rich investment counselor who ends up being arrested and kills himself while in prison (in real life, of course, it's Ruth's eldest son, who ends up committing suicide). Jasmine moves to San Francisco, moving in with her working class sister, which invites comparisons with Ruth, who moved in with her sister for a while, down in Florida. In the film, Jasmine has one son, who ends up moving to California, who she's estranged from. The real-life Ruth was estranged from her two sons but eventually, I believe, reconciled.

'Blue Jasmine' jumps back and forth in time, as the seemingly tragic tale of Jasmine unfolds. When she moves in with her sister, it becomes obvious that Woody Allen is developing his story by taking a page from the Tennessee Williams play book. Jasmine, bearing a striking resemblance to Blanche Dubois from 'Streetcar named Desire', is now caught up in a love triangle involving her sister Ginger, and her new working class lover, Chilli (played by Bobby Cannavale), who also appears to be Woody's version of 'Stanley Kowalski'. While I loved Cannavale in 'Boardwalk Empire', and think he's a great character actor, 'Chilli' is not as complex a character as Williams' Stanley Kowalski. Cannavale's character (along with some of the other characters including Ginger's ex, played by Andrew Dice Clay) seem more like they belong in 'The Sopranos' or 'The Jersey Shore', than denizens of San Francisco.

As the story moves along, Jasmine continues to maintain the illusion that she's important and seeks to restore her social status, which was ripped from her, following her husband's arrest. Woody Allen wants us to feel some sympathy for Jasmine after her employer, a dentist, sexually harasses her. Jasmine's initial plan is to take an online course to become computer literate and later become an interior designer (isn't it more likely that she could find a tutor to help her with computer skills?).

Finally, Jasmine realizes that her salvation is in finding another rich man to assist her in maintaining her past lifestyle. The way she handles her romance with Dwight (Peter Sarsgaard), a State Department employee, who has aspirations to become a Congressman, is indicative of her ongoing delusional frame of mind: of course she'll be eventually found out, if Dwight runs for office! But so determined to return to the good graces of the nouveau riche, she'll ignore the obvious fact, that there's no chance in hell of her ever escaping the watchful eye of the media (I doubt in real life that Ruth Madoff would have been so delusional, that she would entertain the thought of marrying herself off to an aspiring politician and actually believe that she could then escape discovery of her sordid past).

The high point of Woody Allen's plot work comes when Dwight finds out about Jasmine's subterfuge. I was expecting Chilli to spill the beans (no pun intended), but it's actually Andrew Dice Clay's character, Augie, Ginger's ex, who happens to run in to Dwight and Jasmine by chance on the street, and pours out bitter feelings of being betrayed, both by Jasmine and Hal.

There's also a sub-plot that moves quite nicely, involving Ginger having an affair with a kindly audio engineer, Al. Chilli blames Jasmine for causing Ginger to regard him as a low life but in a nice plot reversal, Al turns out to have been cheating on Ginger all along. Did Chilli get to Al's wife and let him know what was going on? Or did the wife, simply figure things out on her own?

In the end, 'Blue Jasmine' is a derivative tale that manages to entertain. Cate Blanchett, who reminds me of a middle-aged Lauren Bacall, does well in attempting to remind us of Blanche Dubois, stuck in unrelenting self-illusion. The problem is that Woody Allen doesn't know his 'Blanche Dubois' character personally as Tennessee Williams did. Thus, we 'get' Jasmine's self-illusion act in the first thirty minutes. The character arc remains the same and that's exactly Allen's point: the character never learns and never grows. Perhaps Blanchett's best scene is where she confronts Hal at the end, when she finally accuses him of infidelity. But Jasmine's whole history, feels superficial; Woody conveys the superficiality of Jasmine's lifestyle in a schematic way, not like the complicated fictional character of a Blanche, or a real-life Ruth.

While Jasmine's one-note character is one of the film's limitations, Woody Allen does manage to come out on the right side of the film's main ethical question. Should we in the end, view Jasmine as a sympathetic figure? Woody, I believe, says no. After all, Jasmine wasn't planning to marry Dwight because she loved him--she simply wanted to be re-established, in her former world of luxury, and continue to look down on all the 'little people', who she regarded as her social inferiors.

As a director who has immersed himself for years in the history of film, Woody Allen continues to churn out decent, 'journeyman' work of late. Don't expect any great poetry or descriptive narrative based on a complex historical world, but this is a director who knows how to cast and work very well with an excellent crew of actors and create a story, which moves quite decently, from A to Z.",1375574400,12,5974,4.968968968968969
5827093,5,B00DL47RQ2,"If you want to see this year's master class in screen acting, you need to watch Cate Blanchett's mesmerizing performance as Jasmine French, a delusional Park Avenue socialite wife in Woody Allen's 46th directorial effort, a sly, bicoastal update of Tennessee Williams' classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Streetcar-Named-Desire/dp/B00124LYHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Streetcar Named Desire</a>. As the film opens, her impeccably dressed character has hit rock bottom after her financial wizard of a husband is arrested and her assets are liquidated. In the throes of a nervous breakdown, she arrives in San Francisco and moves in with her kind-hearted sister Ginger who lives a modest, blue-collar life in a tiny apartment on the edge of the Mission - on South Van Ness near 14th Street to be exact - with her two hyperactive sons. You can tell Jasmine is not only out of her element but quite judgmental about how her sister's life has turned out. The irony of Jasmine's patronizing attitude is that she is a habitual liar who is so angry about her destitute circumstances that she frequently talks to herself. The story follows the basic outline of ""Streetcar"" but takes some interesting turns, for instance, when she tries to better herself by taking computer classes while working as a receptionist at a dental office.

Allen has crafted his film into a clever juxtaposition of current and past events that feels jarring at first since it reflects Jasmine's precarious mental state but then melds into a dramatic arc which resonates far more than a straightforward chronology could have allowed. As a writer, he has become more vociferous in his dialogue without losing his wit. He doesn't pull punches when he showcases confrontations between his characters, whether it's between the two sisters, men and women, or people from different classes. Hostility can come in flammable torrents or in thinly veiled remarks. That Allen moves so dexterously in tone is a testament to his sharp ability in drawing out the truth in his actors. Blanchett is a wonder in this regard because there is something intensely fearless in her approach. Unafraid to lose audience sympathy for her character, she finds an innate sadness in Jasmine that makes us want to know what happens to her next. She also mines the sharp, class-based humor in Jasmine's struggles with one highlight a hilariously executed scene in a pizza restaurant where she explains to her confused nephews to ""Tip big, boys"".

The rest of the cast manage effective turns. Alec Baldwin plays Jasmine's swindler husband with almost effortless aplomb. Sally Hawkins brings a wonderful looseness to Ginger, Stella to Blanchett's Blanche, and finds a level of poignancy in her character's constant victimization at the hands of her sister as well as her brutish, blue-collar boyfriend Chili, played with comic fierceness by Bobby Cannavale in the Stanley Kowalski role. In a conveniently conceived role, Peter Sarsgaard gets uncharacteristically breezy as Dwight, a wealthy, erudite, and matrimonially available State Department diplomat who appears to be the answer to Jasmine's prayers, while Allen casts two unlikely comics in about-face roles - Andrew Dice Clay as Ginger's defeated ex-husband Augie and Louis C.K. as Al, an amorous suitor who brings Ginger a few moments of romantic salvation. Allen's European sojourn appears to have freed him up with the movement of characters in scenes and Javier Aguirresarobe's (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vicky-Cristina-Barcelona/dp/B001G9F9IW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vicky Cristina Barcelona</a>) camerawork complies nicely. The San Francisco locations bring a nice geographic change to Allen's storytelling, and he only uses the Golden Gate Bridge in a long shot once from the Marin side. This is Allen's best work in quite a while, and Blanchett is the ideal muse for his tale.",1375488000,344,3976,5.527093596059113
5827094,5,B00DL47RQ2,"Isn't that what we want from Woody?  Yeah, it's his best work in some years.  One of those films where he manages to withdraw his own personality to a distance, where there's no character obviously speaking the ""Woody"" part.  That part's been done over the years with varying results by Kenneth Branagh, Will Ferrell, Larry David, and others.  But when he vanishes all together, when there's just his characters, speaking in all their poignant screwed-up humanity, who needs the nebbish wise-cracking about how meaningless life is?

Some of the critics seem to see this movie as a scathing indictment of capitalism in general, Wall St in particular, an unbridgeable gap separating its tony, well-to-do characters and its scruffy middle class ones.  What it actually is about is the perils of living a life based on pretense and deception, where the only ones who claim happiness in the end are those comfortable in their own skin, no matter how modest their means.  Cate Blanchett is by turns, heart-breaking and appalling in her narcissistic ravings. Equally memorable in a very different part is Sally Hawkins, the sister whose world Jasmine descends into, bringing the sort of moral and comedic chaos we've come to expect from the master.  (Woody previously used her to great effect in a small part in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cassandra-s-Dream/dp/B0013D8LC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cassandra's Dream</a>).

I feared going in, having read that this was among Woody's darker visions, that there would be little to like in its characters, that their own self-absorption would keep the audience at arm's length.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  It is in his darker works .<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cassandra-s-Dream/dp/B0013D8LC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cassandra's Dream</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Match-Point/dp/1417082658/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Match Point</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crimes-and-Misdemeanors/dp/B00005KIT3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crimes and Misdemeanors</a>) that he crafts his most endearing and enduring characters.

5827268,4,B00DL47RQ2,"A detailed and nuanced portrait of an extremely troubled woman that manages to have a light, comedic tone despite its dark content. Tackles a number of heavy themes like mental illness, identity, and infidelity but always in a clever, entertaining, and frequently funny way. Cate Blanchett is the blinding star of the film, giving a phenomenal performance that she certainly deserved her Oscar win for. Her range here is so broad and she captures every detail of her histrionic character in a way that feels authentic and spontaneous. The screenplay is also largely excellent with sharp dialogue and an intelligent structure which jumps between the past and present in a way that effectively peels the layers of these characters back. There are a few moments that feel a bit contrived, particularly a chance encounter Jasmine has with a former brother-in-law which was a tad too convenient for the story and felt more scripted than spontaneous. These moments are rare, however, and overall Blue Jasmine is a quality film elevated to excellence by Blanchett.

5827269,5,B00DL47RQ2,"Fantastic film!!! The acting is as good as it gets. I think this puts Woody Allen at near the top of my list for reliably great movies. Matchpoint was another masterpiece.
This film shows the difference between the paths 2 sisters took in life, their values and priorities and the result they both get. For folks who envy rich folk, watch this movie and see you buy into some of the fallacies.
Alec Baldwin is one of my favorite funny people, but this is not a comedy and his role could have been done by anyone with the right look. Kate is a superstar throughout. Even Dice Clay is right for the part. Its all good!! HIGHLY recommended. and you could even call it  a 'feel good' movie the way it plays out in the end.",1520121600,3,718,4.279411764705882

In real life, her two sons, who were her only children, were so mortified by their father that one committed suicide and the other died of cancer. Her husband went to prison; she was barred from seeing her grandchildren. Along comes Woody Allen and who's the villain in the piece? She is.

Blue Jasmine and the film The Gift are 2 of her films that show just how talented she really is. The characters are so very opposite and she plays each so credibly she's quickly become my favorite actress. It takes superb actor to be in Woody Allen films. I didn't think I'd ever say that again, but time passes and I watched this knowing it was a special film without realizing it was a film by Woody Allen. It is very well done but not for those who like fast car chases or violence. It's a quirky funny story for those who enjoy cerebral films once in a while. It's a story about adopted sisters who are very different. Jasmine (Cate) can mix well socially with the  wealthy and fit in. She enjoyed her life with her rich but crooked husband, attended events where social elite mix and lost it all. She gets a wake up call and has to live with her sister, who is a rough around the edges type who likes the Blue Collar type, and has to adapt. The contrast between the

5827392,5,B00DL47RQ2,"How did I miss ""Blue Jasmine"" when it was in it's theatrical release? I admit that I haven't liked many of Woody Allen movies since Manhattan, and not because I think he's a sleazy human being. He seemed to lose his way, personally and professionally. Still, I wish I'd seen this film in the theater...it deserved it.

Allen went through three transitions...from his first farcical, almost slapstick stuff like Bananas, to his best period (Annie Hall through Hannah and her Sisters) to his current crop of films, a hodgepodge of meh movies with a few gems like Paris After Midnight (I guess that you can toss in his brief Bergmannesque phase featuring Interiors, which I've always loved).

Blue Jasmine stars a stunning Cate Blanchett, in her best role since playing Hepburn in The Aviator. Blanchette deserved the Best Actress Oscar she won playing what I imagine is sort of an amalgam of bitter wives of wealthy a-holes. What I am wondering about is the message of the film. Is it that rich people are as inherently loathsome as poor people (and even middle class people like the Dentist character, played by a jittery Louis C.K.), just better dressed? Or is it that everyone deserves their lot in life, no matter how badly they were treated? Strangely, the most sympathetic character is played by Andrew Dice Clay, as the stooge who loses everything to the sleazy, but REALLY wealthy husband of Blanchette, played by the always excellent Alec Baldwin.

SPOILER. Obviously this is Allen's riff on ""A Streetcar Named Desire"",  but Blanchette's Jasmine hardly depends on the kindness of strangers (strangers throughout the film look at her with contempt and slink away when she loses touch with reality and talks to herself on the street). Allen's fairly obvious homage to Tennessee William's breaks from the plotline when we see that the title character brought much of her final lot in life upon herself. She was willing to pretend her wealthy husband was on the up and up (despite all evidence to the contrary) and their wealthy life deserved, but when he his numerous affairs come to light and SHE is the injured party, she seals her own doom by ratting him out to the FBI.

All in all a MUCH better film than expected.

5827596,1,B00DL47RQ2,"Finally, I got to watch Blue Jasmine and all I could think of was A Streetcar Named Desire and now I wish I had watched it instead. The acting was phenomenal... Kate Blanchett is brilliant as always but the story sucked...  and her Woody Allen -like stammering painfully reminded me of why I don't like him or his movies. Even Blanchett's talent couldn't save Woody from drowning in yet, another piece of crap film.  We all get it, we liked the first film he did but the character he played is not a genre to be repeated over and over.  I'm convinced, yet again, he's not able to see beyond his own reflection, his own experiences and he wallows in it.  He's so full of himself.  I confess, I can't relate to his world but more importantly, as a director he doesn't begin to understand working class folk and should stick to what he knows.  His characters are simply mirror images of his entitled whiny self obsessed little world.  At the end I thought Blanchett wasted her talent and I felt angry that I wasted my time... p&ss off Woody Allen. I'll stick with Blanche and Stanley and Tennessee Williams.",1484006400,4,1104,4.49

After reading so many positive things about this movie I sort of ""saved"" it to watch when I knew I had the time and would really enjoy it.  Therefore, I was even more disappointed with the movie.  It went nowhere.  How you felt about the characters in the beginning was how you felt about them in the end.  The movie went like this:  central characters have huge issues, they appeared on the way to making progress, then they end up back where they started.  Sure, that's sometimes how 'real life' works, but it was such a letdown.  I think most of us watch movies to see progress and hope in a character.  It gives hope that we might get that same outcome when our lives are full of turmoil.  To see these characters never progress is disappointing.  Cate Blanchett was good, as were the other actors, but overall the movie seemed incomplete.",1483574400,,901,4.460122699386503

5827836,1,B00DL47RQ2,"Not counting that the movie is expertly acted, the entire movie itself rubbed me the wrong way. And I really love a Woody Allen film. Not this one. Maybe it's because so MANY people in Lincoln, Nebraska intentionally call ME Jasmine constantly, and because I get treated like this main character on a regular basis. As in, all the time!-even when I'm on crutches, have just had SURGERY and can barely stand up. It's still somehow important for certain people to keep up the never ending harassment and scare tactics. So, for me, this movie has become something I am forced to live with. And not by choice. I think even if I fell down dead in the grocery store, they would applaud, and laugh. Such. Cruel. People.

This one, I felt was particularly callous regarding women's issues and more importantly mental illness in our society.
Jasmine is clearly suffering major anxiety and no one in the film acknowledges or even treats her with any compassion whatsoever.

It feels like it's such a parody of the ""rich lady knocked down a rung"", but it's far worse.
I couldn't figure out if Woody Allen wanted anyone to actually help her or just keep kicking her down.

I personally have experienced the attitude from people that if you lose your money, (and I had very little to begin with), but that if you do happen to fall on misfortunate circumstances then one is not even allowed to own anything nice at all. That's ridiculous!-people DO treat you like, ""how dare you own THAT, when you're not supposed to have any money."" And it's awful. What are you supposed to do, run around in rags and look like a bum all of a sudden? Our society certainly loves to join in on a good dose of shaming.

People also expect a person who has lived a different economic lifestyle to suddenly be in the know, as to how to be thrifty, as referenced when Jasmine's sister freaks out because she flew first-class.

Yes, I realize Alec Baldwin's character was mimicking Bernie Madoff, but that doesn't necessarily mean Jasmine knew everything and she was in a tough spot.

People can be so cruel, expecting one to suddenly be like a cat with nine lives and invent, or ""come up with"" a brand new ""life plan"", when they are suddenly faced with major turmoil.

Wait until they're the ones holding the cardboard sign at the gas station that says, ""please HELP! God Bless!"" All while surrounded by their family and the van that's broken down. Those VERY same people had a life too. Nobody walks up to them and demands, ""eh, those are the breaks kid, now what are you gonna do!""-No. If we are decent and have any money at all, which I don't, but if I did, I would stop and give a little and offer some kindness and support.

I don't understand this movie at all. I dunno, maybe I'm not smart enough. Whatever. I love Cate Blanchett, I think she did an outstanding job, but I completely disagree with this entire movie and felt that the ending was especially cold hearted.

That's just my personal opinion, and I suffer from major anxiety so nothing was very funny-ha ha, about my symptoms or major panic attacks which, believe me, if you have them, are no laughing matter.

At a time, in our society today, when SO many people are traumatized and are just trying to figure regular daily tasks out, i.e. how to survive, and oftentimes have no money for mental health services, I felt that even the making of this movie, ESPECIALLY in San Fran, where I've read there is a huge homeless problem, was particularly out of line.",1469404800,,3492,4.546178343949045

5828244,5,B00DL47RQ2,"I'm afraid most people who watch this movie are missing the point of it entirely, this brilliant script by woody allen makes a very loud statement about american women in our society in this day and age, this incredibly written and brilliantly acted film will turn everything you know about relationships upside down on its ear -
In this wonderful age of social media, an average man with money and a reasonable education is uninteresting to the average woman, they want the corrupt politician, the greedy corporate businessman, you know, the type of man who is going to cheat on you 100% OF THE TIME !!
In the 1970's or 80's, Andrew Dice Clay in this movie would have been the perfect man for any woman out there, his character is as likeable and respectable as any man you're gonna find, as well as the new man that Jasmine's sister is planning on marrying -
In and of itself, women having this attitude is all fine and hunky dory; but the problem is, 90% of all men in this country are a lot like these guys, which means a lot of good men are being left behind -
Real men like this have become ""boring"" in our society; Mr. Allen, with his infinite wisdom, brings this out in the open for all of us to see -
I cannot help but wonder how many women have not only seen this movie, but feel extremely uncomfortable watching it -
As a 50 year old single man, it was like an epiphany for me, and also as a 50 year old single man, I'm not really sure that my opinion of this film really matters that much -",1453680000,3,1502,4.255244755244755

If you are looking for honesty, gentleness, fidelity, loyalty and the other positive human traits you won't find them here in this film. These type characters seem to be a trend in Woodys movies lately, unfortunately. I remember when Woody Allen films were funny as well as neurotic. Now they are just depressing and neurotic. Now having said that, the actors performances in general were all rather good, especially from Cate Blanchett. There is some language but it is fairly constrained compared to many recent films I have seen and the sexuality stuff is kept to a minimum.

5828402,3,B00DL47RQ2,"Woody Allen has made some great films. This is not one of them. It is exasperating that so many do not seem to notice the precipitous decline in Allen's writing ability over the last few decades. Where he once crafted believable characters with depth, we now have just caricatures. Jasmine is rich, neurotic and spoiled. Her ex is a jerk. Her sister, her ex and fianc and their acquaintances are all unsophisticated galoots. Got it? This is not the same writer of Sleeper, Love and Death, Annie Hall, Manhattan, Stardust Memories, Hannah and Her Sisters, Purple Rose of Cairo, Crimes and Misdemeanors (his last great film), Sweet and Lowdown, etc.

While the film is supposed to take place in San Francisco, it has little resemblance to the actual city. For one, the working class people depicted would priced out of the metropolitan area and certainly not be able to afford a 3-bedroom apartment. Also, personality-wise, there is nothing San Francisco about them. This might have been a chance for Allen to poke fun at the uber-earnest leftist or hippy-dippy culture that exists there (the way he made fun of LA and Hollywood in Annie Hall), but he doesn't. The characters would probably make more sense in New Jersey. Oh, and Jasmine spends most of her free time trying to learn how to use a computer(?) before she can take classes on line. Who under 70 does not have basic computer skills? Not surprising has Woody Allen has had no clue about the real world at this point and no one has the guts to tell him.

There are a few bright spots. The cinematography is still high-quality. We do get some brief fleeting flashes of Allen's humor - namely, the dentist initially trying to pick up on Jasmine (before this plot line takes a dark turn) . We also get the typical tired dixieland jazz soundtrack. While Allen has excellent taste in music and usually makes it work, here it seems tired and uninspired.

No one should be surprised by this. All Allen's latest movies have been terribly overrated (especially Midnight in Paris. I suppose not having to look at Allen and having his characters dumbed-down may have help the popularity of some of these films. He still has interesting ideas but appears to lack the skills or energy to carry them off. With the exception of maybe Vicky Christie Barcelona and Match Point (watchable but not great films) it is pretty sad how far Allen has fallen.

Finally, Allen has not appeared to care about casting since the breakup with Farrow. Every actor feels the need to work with the great genius in order to show that they are an artist and not just a movie star. This leads to some very annoying choices (See Owen Wilson). Here, everyone does the best they can with the material. Andrew Dice Clay is surprisingly good in a supporting role. Still his films have suffered further from the loss of the amazing Farrow and Diane Keaton, among others.

This is really nothing new and started around the time of Celebrity with the nadir being somewhere around Jade Scorpion and Hollywood Ending (both terrible). One wonders if maybe its time to hang it up. Otherwise he is just diminishing what was once a great career. It is perplexing that not even most seasoned critics seem to acknowledge this.",1446249600,12,3232,4.7132743362831855

Scene after scene there mistakes that are so noticeable, they distract you from the dialogue.

For example, Cate sits down, at a table, gets bad news and asks for the waiter, ""I need a drink,"" then immediately picks up a glass of red wine and brings it to her lips?

Same scene, the other actress is speaking and holds her hand on her forehead. Camera changes and as she continues to speak here hand is now on the side of her head - centered right in the shot.

You can't pepper a film with nice locations, beautiful scenery and forget or skip what matters most.

5828471,5,B00DL47RQ2,"Woody Allan is like a bottle of wine.  The older he gets, the better he is.  I have been watching all of his movies from the early start of his career when he was also actor portraying one of the (many neurotic) characters about the contemporary life of an intellectual(s) in a big city; to his latest works of art where he assumes primary role(s) as a director and screenwriter.  As almost as improbably for his age, he seems to produce deeply emotional and touching movies year after year.  The moment movie is out, I have to see it and stories never disappoint.

In ""Blue Jasmine"" there is an amazing cast of actors including Cate Blanchett and Sally Hawkins.  The two of them play sisters, from different biological parents but adopted by the same set of adoptive parent.  Just like one sister is blond and another one is dark haired, the two  are in every way like a day and night -- if one could describe their characters.  Jasmine sticks with her adoptive family, she marries a wealthy man, lives comfortable life of a rich New York City socialite, has impeccable taste in clothes and interior design until one day it al slips from right under her feet.  Her sister on the other hand, is high school runaway who lives in san Francisco, is divorced with two children.  Her former husband is a looser husband with most horrific Brooklyn accent and the new boyfriend is not much better from the ex.

But family is family and when Jasmine starts experiencing hardship (both emotional and financial) her sister steps in to help out by accepting Jasmine in her humble San Francisco home and helping her get back on her feet.  Both sisters start rebuilding their bond that seems to have broken long time ago.  Both are seeking second chances and have insatiable desire to make the best of their remaining lives.  But remember that this is a Woody Allen movie and the story is not a story about ""The American Dream"" with a happy ending.  It is  a story about how our experiences shape us in what we are and experiences from the past can have profound influence on what happens in the present.  Some experiences just cannot be put easily behind and can alter any possibility of future happiness.  But then again- it depends on what each one of us describes as happiness.  For Jasmine, in some way her salvation is her emotional meltdown.  Woman like her can never put the past completely behind and happily move on.  The damage is simply too deep.

Personally I felt this as an exploration of human sanity.  We sometimes love and care for people who do not deserve such tenderness and devotion.  And if they are cruel and uncaring, they can literally drive another person insane.  It is too quick to say that some people are simply crazy.  I agree with Allen - most people are quite normal and fine until they hit the rock bottom that is emotionally too difficult to overcome and it is only then that they become insane.  So when the hurt and loss are so deep and devastating even insanity seems like salvation from having to endure it and re-live it day after day after day.

A touching story, an amazing cast of actors and another Woody Allen masterpiece that just keeps begging for more storytelling to come.",1441929600,,3209,4.580701754385965

5828525,5,B00DL47RQ2,"Woody Allen makes a great film in Blue Jasmine. It is about a housewife in New York that undergoes through a crisis in life.

We get to see a great performance and Oscar-winning by Cate Blanchett as the housewife who disembarks in San Francisco after a trip from New York as she reflects on her life from having a wealthy husband who happens to be a businessman who later is revealed as a crook,her expensive lifestyle when she used to be a socialite and tries to look forward to having a career as an interior designer by taking an online class. Aside from that,she also has to look forward to a new life of that being a working class and feels the adjustments she has to make considering she has no idea of the world of the 99 percenters in the times of the post-economic crash.

This comedy drama provides the viewer at look at the socio-economic life that the Americans are currently experiencing from a woman's point of view who is trying to pick up the pieces after experiencing a tragedy in life. Attention is required to fully enjoy the movie as it is told not in a linear way and the characters involved like Jasmine are definitely far from being generic characters that we are used to see on films.",1440547200,,1208,4.436936936936937

5828542,4,B00DL47RQ2,"The fragility of the human spirit is awesome. We see some who appear to be so strong (the trappings of lots of stuff, status, money can mask their weaknesses), crumble like a piece of crepe paper when the truth is revealed. We see others who have so little, triumph day after day, and rarely complain. First of all, Cate B., is brilliant in this film. Alec Baldwin, whose performance is fine, is upstaged by his absolutely ridiculously dyed hair. (Men of a certain age should never dye their hair...NEVER! And sculpted eyebrows are for women only.) There are other good performances, including Peter Saarsgard, he looks so healthy on his new veganish diet. But it is the story that is so compelling here and the obvious juxtapositioning of class in America and truth telling. Which is better: to steal, cheat and lie and be rich, Or to work for every dollar, be honest, tell the truth to yourself and others and be relatively poor? Neither one seems like a recipe for happiness.  Of course, this is a false choice, because life is never black and white. And we see the players in Allen's story sometimes struggle with the false choice. Jasmine only struggles, when she is hurt by the man making her dreams come true. When she finally realizes and is willing to face the truth, she snaps. Taut, lots of subtexts, and thrilling to watch, this like Allen's Matchpoint, digs deep into human behavior, which is never boring.",1436832000,10,1419,4.698795180722891

5828608,4,B00DL47RQ2,"Whatever the strengths and weaknesses of Allen's yearly offerings, you have to admire a man that is in his 70s, has made 44 movies, and yet seems to keep trying to stretch his wings, and style, while still retaining a very recognizable film-making technique. Allen's films are always clearly
his, yet the tone, feel and structure of the films almost always has something a little new. In this case, Allen is going for straight drama, (yes there are a few amusing moments, but in general this is pretty serious stuff) something he hasn't done since ""Match Point"". But ""Match Point"" also
had the structure of being a mystery/thriller, whereas ""Blue Jasmine"" is a character study, pure and simple. And in that it's not quite like anything Allen has done in his many, many films. The earlier dramas like ""Interiors"" or ""Another Woman"" were both more stylized and weren't really about dissecting a single fatally flawed character as if under a microscope.

This grew on me on a second viewing. Some of my problems remained; a lot of the supporting characters are stereotypes, in spite of being played by wonderful actors, doing all they can to bring them life. But the great Cate Blanchett, who seems incapable of being less than amazing, somehow manages to bring reality, humanity and sometimes even pathos to this self-involved borderline crazy and theatrical mess of a human being.

Whatever the quibbles, this is intelligent, grown up film-making, trying to grapple with big questions of morality and personal responsibility, and unafraid of being a study of a largely unlikable woman. Allen is still among the braver and least compromised of U.S.  directors, and continues to be worth watching and supporting.",1435536000,2,1709,5.01056338028169
5828609,1,B00DL47RQ2,"I'm about as big a movie buff as anyone on earth. I turned this on TV, caught it half way over while eating lunch. And to be honest, I knew NOTHING of this movie since I haven't been paying too much attention to anything out of Hollywood in the past 5 or 6 years, the product has been so bad.
So I did not know the plot or director, nothing, went in completely unknowing.

Gotta tell you, this was some of the WORST acting I've ever seen. I love Cate Blanchett, but she either appeared to be ""acting"" her sweet little heart out, or she was phoning the whole thing in.  I felt embarrassed for this horrible performance and she never found the heart of her character. Yeah, I know, got the Oscar. Truthfully I watch every Oscar show and this one I completely blanked out. Peter Sargaard, same thing: phoned in. Never in a second did he convince me he had the hots for Blanchett's character. Sally Hawkins, Blanchett's white trailer trash sister also phoned her part in. Bad actress not finding her character whatsoever, as if, being British, she talked the way she ""thought"" American white trash talks. Alec Baldwin, phoned in! I had no idea who the director was, I was positive it was an amatuer first-timer. I was shocked to see it was Woody Allen, because, he's the ""actor's director"", right? Sheesh! Time to hang it up, Woody!  Louis C.K., just can't get past the filth of his comedy act and profanity. Literally sickened me that someone would bed or even KISS him! Yuk!  However Andrew Dice Clay was surprisingly good. He could have a brand new
career off the comedy stage as a first-rate character actor.",1435449600,,1608,4.515463917525773

5828611,5,B00DL47RQ2,"""Blue Jasmine"" is great! This is how the story goes: Jasmine French used to be on the top of the heap as a New York socialite, but now is returning to her estranged sister in San Francisco utterly ruined. As Jasmine struggles with her haunting memories of a privileged past bearing dark realities she ignored, she tries to recover in her present. Unfortunately, it all proves a losing battle as Jasmine's narcissistic hangups and their consequences begin to overwhelm her. In doing so, her old pretensions and new deceits begin to foul up everyone's lives, especially her own.

The cast led by Cate Blanchett (superb in her Oscar-winning performance as Jasmine) is great. The directing, story & (Oscar-nominated) by Woody Allen is great.

The cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe is great. The film editing by Alisa Lepselter is great. The casting by Juliet Taylor & Patricia DiCerto is great. The production design by Santo Loquasto is great. The art direction by Michael Goldman & Douglas Husati is great. The set decoration by Kris Boxell & Regina Graves, set dressings by Mike Helbig, John Lister, Cindy Mah, Ari Schwartz & Louis Visco, set designs by Chad Owens is great. The costume design by Suzy Benzinger is great. The visual effects supervised by Jim Rider & Jake Braver is great.

This is a well-done and well-made movie that is entertaining. Cate Blanchett gives another superb performance, for which she won her Oscar, among her other awards accolades for her performance as Jasmine French. Sally Hawkins also gives another solid (Oscar-nominated) performance as her sister, Ginger. Woody Allen has directed and wrote another great film to add to his resume. This or was one of the best films of the summer of 2013 and was also one of the best films of that year, as well, too, or close to, anyway.",1435363200,,1813,4.899022801302932

5828662,1,B00DL47RQ2,"It's hard to imagine a bigger waste of my time than Blue Jasmine. I mean to get only 1 star it really has to be an absolute disaster.  It is.  When much of the movie accomplishes nothing at all with no storyline whatsoever, yeah, it's awful.  Blue Jasmine fits that type of movie.  It's about Cate Blanchett who moves to San Francisco and specifically with her sister Sally Hawkins, and while there Cate has to deal with her sisters obnoxious, drunk, uncaring boyfriend (Andrew Dice Clay's character- and it's LAUGHABLE how tame he is in this film considering what his stand-up routine is like, and even funnier than he's totally out of place in a romantic comedy like this).  Cate has other issues.

She hates working in a dentist's office because she has to set appointment dates for people that often leads to confusion and annoyances for Cate because they suddenly change their times and schedules.  Well Cate that's life. That's part of the job.  It happens all the time.  And her boss likes to hit on Cate in hyperactive, unusual fashion (played by Michael Stuhlbarg).  These are probably the high parts of the movie.  At least they feel like they're attempting to take the storyline in an interesting direction.  They don't unfortunately, but at least these moments *try* to.  Alec Baldwin fans I have some bad news too- he's a typical pretty boy that says very little once again, a role he's comfortable playing in movies and TV shows (and commercials) as of late.  He could easily be emitted from the film without nobody noticing.  Hard to believe given how popular he is, but his character is just wasteful.

To give a surprising compliment, this movie has really phenomenal acting believe it or not.  It's the really really REALLY uninteresting/unproductive storyline that basically shows Cate complaining and feeling miserable with a phony high class snotty attitude even when she should be portrayed as normal that hurts this movie a lot.  It's the ""who's cheating with who"" shenanigans and ""who's kissing who"" stuff that makes up a huge chunk of the storyline that really rubs me the wrong way, and honestly anyone who appreciates how amazing storytelling in movies can be and how gripping you can feel when the story is compelling enough should hate a movie like Blue Jasmine as well.

Sally Hawkins'  plays a woman with a high turnover of men friends. You would think that under the circumstances the first thing she would do is to find out if the new boyfriend is married. But she doesn't even ask. And wouldn't Jasmine ask Peter Sarsgaard, who appears to the audience to be a closeted gay man, more about his personal life?

Having been born and raised in San Francisco myself (my highschool was in downtown San Francisco at the intersections of Ellis & Gough) the characters were not believable as San Franciscans.  It is wishful thinking that the disconnect could be explained by Ginger and Chili being transplants to the Bay Area from the East Coast.  Is everyone in this movie a transplant from the East Coast, or was Woody Allen too lazy to do his homework?  For example, we meet Al (Louis C.K.), and as Ginger & Al walk down Ocean Beach, Louis C.K.'s east coast accent becomes apparent.  In another scene, Ginger & Chili attempt to introduce Jasmine to their East-Coast-talking friend Eddy on a blind date.  Even the name Eddy reeks of East Coast flavor, let alone his thick accent  Ginger's apartment is amazing by San Francisco's standards,  I know tech-industry engineers who can't afford apartments like that, let alone Ginger, a grocery store clerk.  I would love for Woody to have incorporated some San Francisco culture, clothing, or speech into the movie, to at least demonstrate some awareness.

The only scene where I felt real San Francisco authenticity was downtown.  Ironically, it wasn't the characters or directing that made me flashback to growing up in San Francisco, but a directorial mistake.  Dwight and Jasmine are shopping for a ring downtown with movie extras behind them.

5829089,4,B00DL47RQ2,"In the late `70s and `80s the name `Woody Allen' was always the hallmark of a high quality product. Even his serious films which at the time were badly written up by critics now seem highly accomplished. I saw Interiors (1978) and Another Woman (1988) recently and found them both extraordinary. The last 20 years have been less kind to our reclusive schlemiel from the Bronx. The period 2001-2011 in particular saw an all-time career low with dross like The Curse of the Jade Scorpion (2001), Hollywood Ending (2002), Anything Else (2003), Scoop! (2006), Cassandra's Dream (2007) and You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger (2010). On the bright side there was always the odd spark of creative genius and I'm sure posterity will be kind to Melinda and Melinda (2004), Match Point (2005), Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2007) and perhaps even Whatever Works (2009). Midnight in Paris (2011) saw Woody really return to the big-time with a bang - both critics and audiences were suitably wowed, and now after the slightly less impressive To Rome with Love (2012) we have a truly classy product indeed in the shape of Blue Jasmine (2013).

To get at what makes Blue Jasmine so good perhaps one can start by stating what the film is not. It is definitely not a comedy, though there are odd one-liners which hit the spot. It is not one of Woody's Bergman or Fellini-inflected serious metaphysical meditations on the nature of good and evil, or art, or anything else for that matter. It definitely is a wonderfully pointed, sharply focused portrait of the pit-falls of upward-mobility in America's class system. I have always felt that in the past Woody has depicted a one-dimensional America which is solely rich, privileged, upper middle class, white, well-cushioned and altogether too pleased with itself. When Woody's characters suffer it's often really hard to care knowing as we do that they are protected from the realities of the real world. For example, the worst that can happen will be that a character has to cancel a month's subscription to the Met opera or that they might have to move from a large Manhatten apartment into another slightly less-large Manhatten apartment. In Blue Jasmine for the first time Woody tells us that being rich and enjoying the trappings of upper-middle class existence isn't necessarily a good thing. A person can be spoiled, misdirected, warped, robbed of integrity if he/she gives in to all the material come-ons that are proffered. That's exactly what happens to Jasmine (Cate Blanchett) whose fast-lane existence is brought crashing down by the revelation that her husband Hal (Alec Baldwin) is a crook and that everything they have has been in effect stolen.

The film starts with Jasmine returning to San Francisco to stay with her sister Ginger (Sally Hawkins) who has never escaped her working class surroundings and is about to marry a mechanic named Chili (Bobby Cannavale). Jasmine's snobbery collides with Ginger and Chili's straight up honest working class ethics in a series of memorable scenes which are by turn funny, horrific, touching and uncomfortable. The story of her life is skillfully related in flashbacks from these scenes of her struggling to come to terms with her straightened circumstances. In the past Woody has tended to patronize the lesser privileged (I'm thinking especially of characters like the poor yoga instructor in Husbands and Wives), laughing at them, rather than with them. Here, Ginger, her ex-husband Augie (Andrew Dice Clay), Chili and his friend are all intensely sympathetic characters whose lives are blown askew by the arrogance, the snobbery and the self-centered materialism that Jasmine exudes at ever turn. Critics have quite rightly praised Blanchett's Oscar-winning performance, and it's true, she truly captures the vileness of her character. More to the point, she also has us feeling sorry for her, especially in a scene when she catches up with her estranged step-son Danny (Alden Ehrenreich) and realizes exactly how far she has gone wrong. Woody's screenplay is shot-through with social insight and shows a deep understanding of Jasmine's vulnerability. I believe this is a first for him to explore a female character so deeply and so convincingly. Established Woody territory has always been marriage, relationships, the neurotic artist at odds with the world, etc, but a true female character-piece has so far lain unexplored. All credit then to the extraordinary chemistry that is clearly felt here between the writer/director and his muse. A pro-working class, anti-materialist female character piece: Blue Jasmine is that oxymoron in terms - an original Woody Allen picture.

5829125,4,B00DL47RQ2,"Perhaps inspired by a late-night viewing of A Streetcar Named Desire, Woody Allen creates his own Blanche DuBois for the 21st century in Jasmine French, a New York socialite who has lost everything- including her mental stability- in a series of misfortunes and self-inflicted tactical errors.
Allen's Blue Jasmine is an engaging (if flawed) journey down some of the territory covered in Streetcar, with variation. To say Cate Blanchett dominates the film is severe understatement. To watch Blanchett breathe life into what is ultimately an unpleasant character is a marvel to watch- every gesture, every nuance, perfectly timed, capturing the perfect balance of Jasmine's desperation, fear, pretentious posturing and ultimately, mental downward spiral. She's pitiful, appalling and at times hilarious (ex. an outstanding scene in a pizza joint where Aunt Jasmine, ""babysitting"" her young nephews, espouses some very confusing bits of advice, the most memorable being ""tip big, boys..."").
She deserved an Oscar and she got it.
As usual, Allen has assembled an expert supporting cast, peppered by a couple of left-field choices, most notable of which is Andrew Dice Clay, surprisingly effective as Jasmine's bitter ex brother-in-law.
The film has a few drawbacks. Jasmine may seek refuge with her sister in San Francisco, but the change of coast doesn't really register because many of the characters we encounter there (particularly of the working class) look, sound and act like transplants from New York or Jersey. The narrative is bumpy at points, particularly during the second act, which depict Jasmine's half-hearted efforts to adjust to her fall from grace. And while Allen can still conjure up engrossing characters and endow them with wit and character that is usually interesting, the dialogue is fun but not always believable.
However, this is a another overall latter-day triumph for Allen (I'd say his third so far, after Match Point and Vicky Christina Barcelona) and a watershed moment in Blanchett's career.",1409875200,4,2023,5.384858044164038

5829249,5,B00DL47RQ2,"**PLOT SPOILERS**

An extraordinary performance by Cate Blanchett. A devastating film, beautifully matched by the music.

I didn't much care for the tracks that were not jazz, but the jazz tracks were superb.

The choice of the jazz classics, it occurs to me, underpinned the irony or dichotomy between Jasmine's pretense (or her crumbling facade) and the reality of the life that had been built on lies (that she was not necessarily really across in terms of the illegalities being committed by her husband).

The exuberance of the jazz therefore makes Jasmine's descent all the more painful to watch, while adding to the comprehension of just how fragile was her psyche.

It seemed to me Woody was suggesting that he had quite a tough, cynical take on sharks like Alec Baldwin's character and those who benefited like Blanchett's character (a micro-study of the thieves that nearly brought the entire system undone and who gave us the GFC)- there is little sympathy for them on display while her ruin is absolutely complete, a descent into madness.

Woody Allen's best film for quite a while, and Blanchett's performance way ahead of the pack in any Awards year - simply brilliant, beyond brilliant...words do not do her acting justice.",1405900800,,1238,4.985436893203883

5829255,5,B00DL47RQ2,"I have been disappointed by Allen's films since ""Bullets Over Broadway"".  Yes the critics (and presumably audiences) enjoyed his ""Match Point"" and ""Midnight in Paris"" though for my money the former was a reheated ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" and the latter shallow and certainly light fare compared to the other two films released that year that paid homage to the same time frame (""Hugo"" and ""The Aritist"").
  This film is a revelation.  There are no Allen stand-ins, no character stuck with a number of ""ya'know""s mirroring one of Allen's stylistic ticks (and one unlooked for in an educated man).  No character overanalyzes the life going on around him. The acting is superb, with not one weak performance.  Indeed, it has few if any Allen fingerprints on it - which is all for the best.  If I did not know any better I'd swear this was written and directed by a young man - such is the  energy and verve everywhere evident.  It has too often been the case that Allen's films' endings seem patched together (see ""Hannah,"" ""Purple Rose,"" ""Annie Hall,"" ""Mighty Aphrodite,"" etc.).  This film however ends brilliantly - it does not appear at all forced.  He also reveals for the first time an ability to cast an eye on those who are not wreathed in wealth, whose daily struggles strive to drown them - people who do more than create art or criticize it, or worse, do nothing at all with their lives and yet have no compunction about it.  One thing I wish Allen would do - incorporate at least one tune performed or written in the past 75 years or, if that proves too much for him, get someone to write an original soundtrack so we are not again subjected wholly to music that at best appears quaint and at worst appears cobwebbed and stale.

5829308,4,B00DL47RQ2,"Bernie Madoff's Widow Meets A Streetcar Named Desire. That's basically the plot of this amusing but not particularly original Woody Allen movie. It's entertaining and for once, Woody's presence in this movie is more or less invisible except for his insistence on inserting his signature creaky blues and jazz music, which really has little connection to the characters (except for Jasmine's memory of ""Blue Moon"" - a tune that seems too old for the very modern Jasmine to be so enamoured by).

Alec Baldwin is oddly subdued as the Madoff character- he never seems to suffer Jasmine's depth of humiliation and misery even though he lost his fortune as much as she did. There are no scenes of him tearing his hair out or screaming over the loss of his fortune, though the real-life Baldwin is obviously capable of this.  He is, however, really a minor character and the film's main focus is in capturing the range and depth of Jasmine's hysterics and capacity for madness. The film indulges in a kind of sado-maschoistic scheudenfraude in watching her degradation and suffering, though it certainly is entertaining. I get the feeling that Jasmine is a composite of Ruth Madoff and Mia Farrow, two women who were victimized by the men they loved. When Jasmine rats out her husband to the feds after Baldwin dumps her for a teenage au pair, I couldn't help seeing the ghost of Mia ratting out Woody to the police after the Soon-Yi affair.

Too bad Woody couldn't have stayed with the Ruth Madoff storyline, which in itself is fascinating enough. Do we really need to see Woody's version of ""A Streetcar Named Desire?"" Taking old Tennesee Williams material and ""updating"" it to the present really doesn't work.  Woody's ""working class"" characters inspired by Williams are so stereotypical, so laughably 1940s and 50s caricatures, that I found it hard to believe any of them really exist in today's world. In my view, Allen can only write about rich people with authority.

The film is never boring but is predictable and simplistic.  It's hard to believe that Saargard, as Jasmine's new lover, works for the State department but never, ever, guesses the truth about Jasmine until a chance encounter (all the time they dated, he was never suspicious that she never invited him over to her home?!)

The most positive thing to come out of this film is that it gave Cate Blachett an opportunity to showcase her considerable thespian powers, giving her a great ""woman's role"" that is sorely lacking in today's movies. She makes this film look better than it actually is.",1404172800,,2560,4.8577981651376145

Would I let him borrow my video camera to make a movie? Hell yeah, I would.

To me, this is Woody's best movie in a long time. The tone of BLUE JASMINE reminds me of CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS, only without the Funny. And that's OK by me.

JASMINE is very well-written and well-acted. It is a dramatic film that has moments of much-needed levity. But for the most part...it's a downer, dude. But it's a fascinating downer. Cate Blanchett deserved her Oscar, and the supporting cast are all first rate (it's a Woody Allen movie, after all).

And finally, can we all forgive Andrew Dice Clay for his offensive stand-up act from the 80's? It's time to move on. The Diceman is a really good actor, and his turn in BLUE JASMINE was revelatory, to say the least.",1403740800,2,807,4.4324324324324325
5829336,4,B00DL47RQ2,"To watch Blue Jasmine is to see the star Cate Blanchett in top form, playing a deeply troubled and misguided socialite Jasmine, who finds a second chance of living as she used to before her fall from grace. Unable to forget the rich and comfortable life she once enjoyed as the wife of an unscrupulous investment banker (Alec Baldwin), Jasmine starts living with her less sophisticated sister Ginger (Sally Hawkins).

Of course, this is Woody Allens version of A Streetcar Named Desire, and not surprisingly, the film is not something that would make you happy when leaving the theater. The film is often funny, but darkly so. This is a film critics would praise, but not for the same reason when they praise Midnight in Paris.

In short, most likely you will not like the character of Jasmine, even though you will be fascinated by Cate Blanchett (who won Oscar for this role) and her riveting performance as the heroine in denial. Supporting players all did great jobs.

Thus, you are watching the continued self-destruction of this 'beast', as she roots through and messes up the lives of others.  yuk.",1403395200,,385,5.161290322580645
5829361,5,B00DL47RQ2,"Although several of his recent films have taken place outside New York City (""Vicky Christina Barcelona,"" ""Midnight in Paris,"" ""To Rome With Love""), most of Allen's oeuvre has centered on the activities of wealthy, educated, successful New Yorkers. Like Jane Austen's relationship with her own subject matter, Allen focused on the stories of the kind of people he knew best. In every case, wealth and privilege are taken for granted. The closest he came to the fragility of social position was in ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" which concerned a protagonist at risk of losing everything as a result of an impulsive romantic entanglement. ""Blue Jasmine"" is different in that this fragility is made real; the protagonist does in fact lose everything.

Told in a series of flashbacks, I was initally confused by the film's first few minutes - it appeared as if the main character, after arriving broke at her sister's in San Francisco, was suddenly rich again and throwing dinner parties. Once the main features of the scenes taking place in the past were apparent (New York setting, Alec Baldwin's presence, lots of money), it was easy to tell them apart - easier for the audience than Cate Blanchett's character sometimes.

The film may be unappealing to some as the characters are without exception shallow, stupid, or dishonest - or all three. Allen scrupulously avoids portraying the working-class characters as sympathetic or admirable - these include violent, drunken crybabies, shiftless losers, shameless liars, and vindictive kvetches. As the central character, Jasmine is shown to be disloyal, superficial, and when she had power and money, uninterested in using it to build anything of enduring value. And yet we cannot take pleasure in her final downfall (actually several downfalls). Maybe the film's final lesson is to not feel so superior to the filthy homeless person babbling to himself.

My main criticism of the film is its weakness of location. Allen has if nothing else always strongly communicated the feeling of whatever city his story took place in, but the San Francisco of ""Blue Jasmine"" almost seems an afterthought. Other than a few shots of Lombard Street and the Golden Gate Bridge, the film could have been anywhere. Indeed, a more bland setting, like the Inland Empire or Council Bluffs, Iowa, might have better communicated the atmosphere of disappointment and downward spiral that the film was trying to convey. San Francisco is too much fun, too young, high-tech, and vibrant for such thoughts, although maybe Allen intended for there to be a contrast. At one point, a character says ""if you can't find love in San Francisco, you can't find it anywhere."" Unfortunately, she's right.

Not an easy film to watch, and lacking anything even approaching a satisfying resolution, nevertheless ""Blue Jasmine"" is valuable as a counterweight to Allen's obsession with what could be characterized as first-world problems. Or, to quote Galway Kinnell,

The raindrops trying
to put the fire out
fall into it and are
changed: the oath broken,
the oath sworn between earth and water, flesh and spirit, broken,
to be sworn again,
over and over, in the clouds, and to be broken again,
over and over, on earth.",1403395200,2,3222,5.09469696969697

5829363,5,B00DL47RQ2,"""Blue Jasmine"" doesn't possess the comic element that many of Woody Allen's films do, but it is the best film that Allen has written and directed in twenty years. It doesn't have a strong plotline. Though the action takes place over a period of months, this is an extended vignette about the unraveling of a Manhattan socialite after her husband is convicted of fraudulent investment schemes. We first see Jasmine (Cate Blanchett) as she approaches San Francisco by plane, talking nonstop to the passenger beside her about her marriage and relocation to San Francisco, where she intends to stay with her sister Ginger (Sally Hawkins). Jasmine and Ginger are as different as night and day -Jasmine the WASPy Park Avenue house wife and Ginger a bohemian working class divorce with 2 rambunctious boys. But Jasmine has no where else to go. The Justice Department took all of her husband Hal's (Alec Baldwin) assets, leaving Jasmine to have a nervous breakdown.

Woody Allen writes his social dramas and comedies about that which he knows, and for the past decade that has tended to mean the upper classes. Being a monied Manhattanite himself, Allen must know women like Jasmine, who lost everything they thought they had won in life, when their husbands were either convicted of fraud, went bankrupt, or lost their sources of income in the financial crisis. Jasmine is narcissistic, cold, out of touch, and possessed of a ridiculous sense of entitlement. To make her sympathetic is a lot to ask of an actress, but Cate Blanchett makes an anti-hero out of this disturbed, spoiled woman, who is, nevertheless, very fragile and genuinely trying to make ends meet and carve out a new life for herself. Woody Allen's talent for natural dialogue is on display, capturing the interplay of obnoxious people of two different classes on two coasts, as the film flits back and forth in time with Jasmine's memory.

But the echoes of the past won't leave her to make new plans and another emotional eartquake waits for her.

Allen returns to his stage from the eighties (Interiors, September, The purple rose, Hannah and her sisters) and made a terrific and acidic vision about the no sense existence in which that woman in a cage of glass seems to live.

Cate Blanchett (Jasmine) has a very realistic nervous breakdown and by the end of the movie, the extent of her mental illness is unnerving. She is mesmerizing in this role.

It's not at all funny, so it has to be  reviewed as a psychological drama. As such, it is superficial. All characters except Jasmine herself are without dimension, just there for the convenience of the plot. Jasmine is superbly personified  by Blanchet, but the character is also limited to her emotions, behaviors, and flashback memories. We really have no idea who she is. Her inconsistent, self defeating, self absorbed, and sometimes weird behavior is unconvincingly explained by her suffering some kind of only-in-the movies type of mental illness

Cate B does a magnificent performance! As you watch her, you become mesmerized by every tiny little gesture and facial expression that makes you expect her to have a complete mental breakdown. One of the things that particularly impressed me is that she did not have superb makeup while in her role of going downhill. She looks dishevelled and wornout, which is what the role demanded.

The reason she basically becomes homeless is quite surprising. I didn't see it coming. You may be shocked at how she puts her life at risk.

Once she decides she needs to get her life together she puts her best effort forward but is harassed by her employer. As she seeks to find herself a new husband she plays a part she really thinks could become her reality.

All the while we see her mental illness taking over. The more she tries to hide her past life the worse things get.

What amazed me about this movie is how well Cate Blanchett acts throughout. She truly understood what it is like to lose your mind. Anyone who has been there will relate.

I will say I was completely captivated with the movie right until the end when the unimaginable occurs. I won't say what happens but to be honest it was a bit of a disappointment. You are sort of left wondering how the main character is going to survive on her own. I wanted a happy ending for sure. So I have my own made-up ending in my head.

5829599,5,B00DL47RQ2,"Blue Jasmine is about Jasmine, a socialite who is down on her fortunes and is played by Cate Blanchett, could be her most significant performance to date. Jasmine is a Manhattan career socialite whose world starts crumbling when her scamster husbands financial schemes are exposed- echoes of Madoffs widow. She is broke and is forced to seek refuge with her sister Ginger ( Sally Hawkins) in San Francisco, Blue Jasmine is a typical Woody Allen movie with a variety of characters, all of them exciting, quirky, many funny lines and astute observations of society in general. Most of the males are portrayed as dumb but nevertheless multi layered because they have been  assembled so very well. A  well made movie about  fall of the former one percenter who now has to live just like the rest of  us. Very entertaining movie centered around Cate Blanchett. Please watch it - just for her performance.",1398470400,2,899,4.856209150326797

Allen chains his characters into two dimensions--primary motivation and sex drive. To be fair, his dialogue is still better than most. But does anyone really care what happens to a selfish, broken, brain addled park avenue princess after the parade has passed her by? When Jasmine starts making a new life of her own--one that might have meaning--there's a glimmer of chance (and a chance missed). Alas, there's no transformative power here.",1398470400,,591,5.365591397849462

5829657,5,B00DL47RQ2,"Cate Blanchett took home the Oscar for this one and rightfully so.  In a year of spectacularly, incredibly wonderful performances she prevailed by portraying a woman overly impressed with her 'good life,' a life oiled by all the money she could spend without worrying where it came from.  Raised as an adopted child, perhaps this beginning affected her outlook on life.  Intellectually talented but not  quite disciplined enough to maintain herself when her dream world crashes, she hides her depression behind a bravura personality powered by the fantasy  that she is still an important person who understands the best things and knows the best people and is entitled to be treated with the same kid gloves that cushioned her life before the fall when everything that mattered depended on possessions and appearance.

Needing help to manage, she descends on her sister, also adopted, who has a very different, working class mentality; who has had to work hard and constantly to make ends meet.  Nothing about the two sisters matches or works together.  We watch as Cate's character and life dissolve into total breakdown.  The quick emotional changes, the almost schizophrenic characteristics that flash off and on during the performance are thrilling to watch.  The discipline of the actress, and the absorption of her character are classic lessons for the profession of acting.",1397865600,4,1380,5.175675675675675

The dialogue is snappy and compels us to have great empathy and also laugh at their foibles and our own. Nicely interspersed segues take us to NYC for the back story of Jasmine and her demise.

I thought, ""She knows these feelings. She didn't have to be told."" The movie is good, but it's the acting that pushes it into the very good territory.  Blanchett plays a complex character who goes a bit off the deep end. Which is not to say she goes insane. This is Cate Blanchett's movie, pure and simple. I can't imagine anyone else playing her character. But I'll mention the actress who plays her sister, Sally Hawkins. She and Blanchett play off each other such that I forgot they weren't really sisters in real life. Alec Baldwin's acting chops shone in this movie, as well. And Andrew Dice Clay? Who knew?

5829844,4,B00DL47RQ2,"Amazing acting job by Cate Blanchett playing a stuck-up, weak minded, morally vapid, ubber materialistic, psycho mess of a human being.  This movie wasn't a Hollywood clap trap, cookie cutter story line where the character learns the error of her ways, and grows & matures to be a fine virtuous person.

It just tells a great story of flawed humans (which we all are) in everyday situations and that often, as life proves again and again, there isn't a happy ending where everything works out just fine.  Which is pretty much a summation of Woody Allen's philosophy on life.  Although I'm not nearly the pessimist he is, and I believe we make our own happiness if we want to be happy (takes a lot of work), nonetheless, let's face it, real life rarely goes by way of movie plots.

Kate Blanchett does a marvelous job (as she usually does) and is frighteningly and thoroughly convincing in her role (as are all the players), however, my one issue with the movie are some of the actual characters such as  Augie (Andrew Dice Clay), Ginger (Sally Hawkins),  Chili (Bobby Cannavale), &  Eddie (Max Casella).  Not the actors themselves mind you, nor their performances.  My questions is why do these four main characters act and sound like they are from New York/New Jersey area with their diction, accents, and mannerisms when this takes place in the Bay area of California???  Jasmine's character is the only one from New York, and it's because she moved there when she met her husband.  There is no reference (unless I missed it) that these characters are all originally from the Tri-State area and they are transplants themselves.

So, it just seemed like these characters were taken from a different New York story based Woody Allen movie, and injected into Blue Jasmine, and it doesn't quite work.

Other than that, I highly recommend this movie for great, fun, interesting, if not tragic characters and a good story line.",1396828800,,1923,4.787878787878788

I am always happy to see Cate Blanchett in anything.  What an ego trip it must have been for her to have been cast as Galadriel, a part written to be the most beautiful creature, and powerful woman, ever to grace the face of the earth.  She showed a completely different side in ""Blue Jasmine,"" and in my opinion should have taken the Best Actress Oscar.

The Blu-Ray itself is excellent, and does not subject the viewer to endless ads and previews like so many of them do nowadays.  It just starts up, like they all should.  I suppose this was at the insistence of Mr. Allen, and I commend him for it.",1396656000,,742,4.411764705882353

The problem, the story line went no where.  The people's lives were just as screwed up at the beginning as at the end.  For all the back story, forward story and character development, the story went no where.  All that time spent watching and wondering how it would unfold just to find out there was no unfolding just one big stupid circle.  Maybe people like that sort of thing. Not every story has a complete ending, happy or sad. This one was all middle.  No beginning, no end.  I was ticked when the show was over.  That's it?  Seriously?  For what took place in the show, it could have been played out in 20 minutes with a  better writer and producer.  If I had anyone else in my family watch this they would be mad at me.  What kind of garbage am I making them watch?  So glad I wasted my afternoon away ironing clothes while watching this.

I am so sick of Woody Allen always being made out as a genius. Obviously the man has a talent for talking because how people in Hollywood can be bluffed this is a good movie is beyond me.  I like all kinds of movies. I am not a snob at all.  This movie was completely unsatisfactory.  Don't let the nominations it was up for and any awards it made food you.  Go in expecting nothing and you will be happy. I went in expecting something and found crap.  Personally I like watching shows people can because when I expect junk I usually find it entertaining.

He likes beautiful women, bathes them in the affectionate, even flattering light of his gentle humor but always underneath is the acerbic bite...a sort of malicious revenge...in exposing their falseness, magnifying the flaws they try to hide.

This film could have been just another witty expose, but Cate Blanchett defies type.  Her 'hidden flaws' are all out there.  She scratches with the unsheathed claws of a wildcat.  Untamed by misfortune, her lack of pretense distinguishes her from many of Woody's women, but she is not artless in her femininity.  Far from it.

However, the weakness of Woody Allen's script shows at times, as Blanchett's Jasmine has as much character development as your average rain puddle.

Someone needs to tell Woody that woman smart enough to know where the bodies are buried with her Bernie Madoff-type husband would also be smart enough not to end up essentially on the street. The post-traumatic stress part of the story was interesting, but Jasmine seems drift into it just enough to seem crazy, but not enough for it to really affect her ability to function effectively. I know some folks who have PTSD and trust me, the effects of the condition play way more destructive than we see here.

More and more, the subtext of Woody's films seem to be about proving he has range and can write sympathetic characters other than his alter-ego. Since he's stopped putting himself in his films, his overall work has improved, but this is his worst effort script-wise since ""Celebrity.""

""Blue Jasmine"" tells a tale of a NY City socialite (Jasmine) who seems to have it all.  When the movie begins, it appears Jasmine has lost it all.  She has been forced to move across country to live with her adopted sister, who she feels is a few steps below her on the rungs of the social ladder.  What ensues is both a journey into life...and into madness.  Jasmine is played (and she won the Oscar for it) superbly by Cate Blanchett.  I suggest watching the movie at least TWICE so you can pick up on just how well this amazing actress does.  Watch her body language when she's talking to adopted sister, as opposed to when the Senator-to-be calls her.  Her supporting cast is also wonderful including Andrew ""Dice"" Clay.

I noted that another reviewer said this movie was ""predictable and slow paced.""  That is true.  You're not going to find car chases, crashes, blow off heads and other body parts in this movie.  This is one of those movies that (*GASP*) makes you think.

Directed by Woody Allen and rated PG13, ""Blue Jasmine"" is a must see.  Highly recommended.",1395878400,4,1291,4.383966244725738

5830153,3,B00DL47RQ2,Woody Allen does it again.  Once more he set up a sad situation with a woman who had problems and then just stopped the movie without any resolution one way or the other.

 Cate Blanchett was --as predicted --amazing. . . .

Woody Allen has made great films but this is not one of them.  That said, it's worth seeing just for Cate Blanchett's Oscar-winning performance.  Stick through to the end, which is when you will see why she won - I almost switched it off halfway through (was getting bored and annoyed with the characters/caricatures) but am glad I saw the whole thing. Some (but by no means all) of the supporting performances are also good, making the poor quality of the dialogue and amateurishness of the movie overall that much more frustrating.

She was well supported by her fellow cast members including the lovely Sally Hawkins, Peter Sarsgard and Bobby CanavaIe.  I could almost taste her sweat and stale perfume.  The best performance by a female actor since Meryl Streep in ""Iron Lady"".",1395360000,2,569,4.957894736842105
5830324,5,B00DL47RQ2,"'Blue Jasmine' is a wonderful movie which is highlighted by fantastic acting, particularly the Academy-Award winning performance of Cate Blanchett.  The story is interesting but not overbearing or cliched, and there is a great twist at the end that will have you saying 'ah-hah'.  It is both funny and sad; engrossing and intense; and charming, all at the same time.

The story concerns the plight of Jasmine French, a rich socialite who precipitously has a change in her fortunes (no pun intended).  She moves from New York to San Francisco to live with her sister, and the rest of the story unfolds as she tries to rebuild her life, while simultaneously disturbing everyone else's life around her.  The movie shows the meaning of blissfully ignorant vanity and how one person's desires and needs can overwhelm both herself and others she comes into contact with.  At the end of the movie, you will find yourself trying to understand why Jasmine does what she does, but at the same time not being surprised by what happens.

The supporting performances are just brilliant - who knew Andrew Dice Clay could be so brilliant???  The rest of the characters are spectacular and the performances are almost as good as that of Blanchett.

If you want to watch an entertaining movie with really good performances which will keep your interest from beginning to end, then this one will do that.

As a resident of San Francisco, I have to wonder if Woody Allen spent even a day here before working on this script. The town is ripe for satire, from the self-absorbed techies wearing Google Glasses and piling on and off of the monstrous buses that are clogging the streets in the Mission, to the oh-so-precious restaurants and food trucks that combine ingredients that God purposefully put on opposite ends of the earth to keep apart. Instead, what we get is a bunch of New Jersey mookspossibly the only kind of person you will never run into in the San Francisco. He might as well have set it in Asbury Park. The whole thing would have made more sense there.

Then there is the inescapable feeling that this story was intended as a swipe at Mia Farrow. I'm sure Mr. Allen will deny it, but it sure seems like one to this disinterested bystander. I usually enjoy Woody Allen's films and I was looking forward to his take on life in SF, but what we got was this weird personal vendetta instead.

5830427,4,B00DL47RQ2,"Economic collapse is the new big, bad wolf. Jasmine's been hiding inside a house made of straw. More than a few films of late have employed class & money as their foil. Blue Jasmine does it better than most.

I'm not a Woody Allen fan, but I will admit to liking a few of his films. This one will be added to the list. The script is great and pulls off a series of flashbacks while never being heavy handed. It goes to great lengths to create empathy for those on either end of the socioeconomic ladder, though strictly on the Caucasian scale. San Francisco & New York are two of the most expensive cities to live in, so I never felt too bad for any of the protagonists.

The performances in the film are great and Allen lets things happen on screen in long takes. This drew me in and hooked me. Cate Blanchett and Sally Hawkins give five star performances. Blue Jasmine creates a world of its own and yet lets the viewer come to their own conclusions. It doesn't answer all the questions making it all the more satisfying to me.",1395100800,,1029,4.298969072164948
5830428,3,B00DL47RQ2,"Blue Jasmine relates a story of life, in the 'you reap what you sow' genre--
how people may make careless and egoic decisions instead of staying centered
in the heart. Jasmine who has enjoyed the life of wealth and privilege,
succumbs to her desire to keep up appearances at all cost. When she cannot have what she wants,which is
her continuation of marriage with her husband, she makes a phone call in haste that sets a chain of events in motion
that take her fortune and leave her with enough, but not enough for Jasmine.
She doesn't accept or ask for assistance from her many friends and acquaintances in society but instead
chooses to move in with her unmarried sister who has 2 children and lives in San Francisco. Instead of gratitude, she
is critical of her sister's apartment, her boyfriend and the way she lives her life, yet continues to use her
in order to try to regain a foothold. She soon finds out that no one allows her to forget her past, as her former brother-in-law and her sister's boyfriend and her stepson, all living in San Francisco, continue to throw it in her face.
Not realizing that when meeting new people that the first thing they do to get to know you is ask questions, she is blindsided once more as she realizes she cannot escape her past nor be honest about it without paying a hefty price. We are left at the end of the movie at this point, where her illusions break her open and she is either ripe for growth or a victim of her shallowness.
I liked the acting of everyone in the movie, it looked and felt very honest. All the characters were on their paths, affected by the less wonderful things in life as well as the wonderful-- some of them dropped their stories and moved on to build new lives and some of them remained affected by the stories they told themselves over and over and reacted from the place of victim.

The 1961 version is tidied up, per 50's moral values..but this one with Hellen is able to include sex scenes quite well done , without full frontals, etc. It seems just underneath our surface qualites of civility and good taste, under cetain circumstances, e.g. rapily fading sexual atractiveness, vis wrinkled......drowning woman grasping at anything that floats..anything that takes her back to youthful lust...seems quite the appropriat choice...probably for any of us who feel the world has left us behind; with feelings of "" I wish I could go back and re-experience youthful lust..."".
After that, you might , if you collect good films by great actors and actreses..get Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"" with Hellen Mirren...even if you find Shakespeare a bit heavy and tedious, you will like this one. What a great job on this production;..what an actress.",1394841600,,1617,4.837545126353791

5830683,3,B00DL47RQ2,"Spoiler Alert!  If you haven't seen this movie and don't want any details, stop reading.  I thought this was a well acted film by the entire cast, and it was very nice looking, but the story was pointless and mean spirited. First, I don't think there was a single likable character in the entire film, although Sally Hawkins was a contender until she ruthlessly cheated on her fiance because she ""deserves better.""  Second there was no growth in the characters, except maybe the step-son.  The movie ended where it began, with Jasmine talking to herself and Ginger with Chili on the couch.  Third, ALL OF THE CHARACTERS ACTED LIKE THEY WERE FROM NEW YORK!!!  This film was supposed to be set in San Francisco but all the San Francisco characters had New York accents.  Seriously, Andrew Dice Clay is one of the San Francisco people.  It was annoying.  Fourth, Woody Allen clearly has no grasp of poverty.  When Jasmine first walked into Ginger's apartment and looks around, the camera pans over the supposedly crappy furniture and tasteless decor so the audience can cringe, but my reaction was ""Wow!  Awesome place!""  He also doesn't really figure out what the difference between Hal and Chili or Hal and Augie are other than money, which is pretty weak, and ignores the true cultural/class difference between the wealthy and the poor in America. Fifth, the deus ex machina confrontation on the street between Jasmine and Augie was too bizarrely neat to be anything but distracting.  Suddenly Augie is there to deliver a swift and fatal blow to Jasmine's new relationship on a street corner.  And boom, just like that, it's over.  Lastly, the weight of the confrontation between Jasmine and the stepson at the end of the movie is really undermined by the fact that the relationship was totally undeveloped in the movie.  This film paints a picture with broad, unbelievable strokes.  That would be forgivable if there was a moral to the story, or some resolution, like American Beauty, but there's nothing here. I gave three stars because Alec Baldwin is entertaining, Cate Blanchett's performance is pretty good (though seems like a caricature sometimes), Sally Hawkins is fantastic, Bobby Cannavale is great, Louis CK is good, Peter Saarsgard is good, and there are some laugh out loud moments.",1394409600,,2296,4.922077922077922

The blond, whatever her name is, is very good at bringing the emotional states of the main character to life, and she certainly earned the various and sundry acting awards she got for doing so this year. It's all we really need from actors, right, look the part and do the appropriate emotional states in a believable way; she's an expert at mimicking the emotions.

It is an insider joke among the group attending that we are all thankful that none of us had to pay for this movie which is an example of an old, weary pervert who must be delusional thinking he could produce a remake of such an American classic

The only ""guest"" who stayed in the viewing room (the reason the host kept the DVD running) was an uninvited guy who tagged along with an embarrassed friend.

5830737,2,B00DL47RQ2,"It's difficult to describe my challenges with this movie without being a spoiler; the reveal is subtle and easily missed, and much anticipated redemption is only found in the secondary plot involving Jasmine's sister.  Unsympathetic characters that fail to recognize their own moral failures in the face of repeated opportunities have he ability to drive a story, but only if they have a moment of insight and choose to ignore it.  Consistent ignorance without insight is just a story about a deluded person continung to do deluded things.

The acting was superb acrosss the board, although the preponderance of blue collar East-coast accents in San Francisco was disconcerting to this native West-coaster.  Cate channeling Woody (as so many actors before her have) was also disconcerting: Woody's neuroses and Jasmine's borderline sociopathy seemed psychologically incompatible.

Jasmine then moves in with her sister while still upholding her high-society ideals, fails in her attempts to rebuild herself - partly because of misrepresenting her background, and ends up homeless and muttering to herself on a park bench.

Cate Blanchett was great in the role and she does a good job portraying her character but the rest of the movie to me really didn't resonate with me at all.  The movie was a bit erratic with its back and forth of past and present and the ending was totally unsatisfying in its conclusion.

Sally Hawkins has always been a favorite of mine since  I saw her in Happy Go Lucky, Blanchett always gives a riveting performance no matter what she's in! OFCOURSE Baldwin plays the white collar sleaze bucket better than anyone I know and Bobby Cannavale played his character very well, all good. The only thing I was wondering was why atleast 3 of them, even Sally Hawkins seemed to sport a New York dialect! I think it would have been better had Jasmine gone to New York, say Brooklyn or the Bronx to stay with Ginger & left her rich life in San Francisco or anywhere in California for that matter, because the New Yorkers  seemed misplaced in San Francisco, Baldwin and Blanchett were the ones from there butdidn't sound as much like like they were from there as much as  the friends and family in San Francisco, just an observation, Kate Blanchett and Slly Hawkuns have great  on screen chemistry together, like peas in a pod, although they were clalled Jasmine & Ginger, more  like 2 flowers than peas, wonder if the Screen writers realized that when they chose their names,  Fantastic  movie never- the-less!",1394236800,,1484,4.637404580152672

I particularly liked and appreciated all the designer brands the movie highlights, and really feel for the main character all the more for her ""fall from grace"". It makes you want a sequel just to see what happens to ""Jasmine"".  Treat yourself to an afternoon of escape, and watch this wonderful delight of a movie, with excellent acting all around.

It seems in my experience with a Woody Allen movie, when iy gets bad reviews, I love it, buy it and watch it over and over, when tge movie receives critical acclaim, I'm shaking my head, wished I hadn't wasted those 2 hours and totally didn't ""get it.""

His characters stumble through a wasteland called life. Yes, he has humor but it is ever so dark. Perhaps this is a reflection of Woody Allen' own life. If you hold a sea shell to you ear, you can hear the ocean but,in fact there is no ocean, there is nothing but a void. The.characters mirror this void. Joy is not a known quantity. No one in his movies ever connects the dots in life.

5830956,4,B00DL47RQ2,"I saw the movie at the theater when it came out last August. With company. All of us agreed it was a downer, but there was no doubt in my mind that Cate Blanchett was headed for an Oscar. No doubt, she deserved it. The question of my mind was why did Allen try perhaps the bleakest film of his career after three breezy comedies (Vicky-Cristina Barcelona, Midnight in Paris, to Rome with Love) more in line with his usual fare--and those after the notable The Match Point, a post-Dostoyevskian tale of crime and punishment. At least the latter was enjoyable, even more so because of the golden Caruso-laden arias in the soundtrack. Blue Jasmine had echoes of Blanche DuBois (but no Marlon Brandon in this), but the whole plot limped and the ending had no ""lift"" for the viewer. Perhaps Woody, as he had done so often, wanted to remind us that, although he does not belong in Hollywood (and truly bitter about it) that he is still the greatest American filmmaker, when he chooses to prove his point--and that the rest of us are too moronic to capture all his nuances. I have been his follower in the past four decades, and am always curious to know what he has concocted. But I think, at this point, he has already proved--of failed to do so--what he really is: great when he does something like Midnight in Paris, with its multi-layered past/present illusions, a bit malice here and there, airheaded-ness to the max, attack on crashing bores, and disillusion with the institution of marriage--ditch it on occasion for romantic love. Not all America listens to him. But those who do find his occasional gems redeeming. I hate to see his New Yorker's psyche tumbling to the dust.",1393977600,,1677,4.630872483221476

5830960,4,B00DL47RQ2,"Woody Allen strikes again! And this time he has the indomnitable Cate Blanchett as his main character, Jasmine. The title is a reference not only to Jasmine's mood and personality, but to the song that was playing when she met her ex-husband, a philandering. weasly entrepeneur played by Alec Baldwin. Even though Jasmine suspects her husband, she chooses to ignore it because they live on Park Avenue and have a country home and he lavishes her with gifts. What's not to love? After he is taken to prison for embezellment, Jasmine divorces him. She is left peniless and goes to live with her sister in San Francisco. Jasmne's Xanax and Stoli martini combinations make for some hilarious scenes.

I felt so bad for the characters who got taken for a ride and for the ones who misrepresented, for it wasn't only the title character who is put through some stuff, but supporting characters as well, who have their own back stories that could make their own movie. You want to see all these people be happy cause they're just regular Joes and Janes-and Jasmines who many , of us can relate to and you're rooting for them to win as they demonstrate how they made their own choices and thisi is the not so pretty result.

There is so much here to think about. The performances of both the star and her sister are excellent and believable. The script is true to life as most of what Woody Allen writes is. I highly recommend this film. I could easily watch it a second or even a third time.",1393891200,,430,4.2560975609756095
5831009,3,B00DL47RQ2,"I have a few gripes about Blue Jasmine. First of all, of course Cate Blanchett was amazing, but everything else in the movie was underdeveloped or incredibly superficial and only existed as a backdrop for her performance. It was an obvious update to Streetcar Named Desire, but without the depth. I was really irritated throughout the movie that Woody Allen set a movie in San Francisco, but all the characters talked like they were from Staten Island or something. (I know the sister moved there from the east coast, but her boyfriend, his friend, etc. were all stereotypical blue collar east coasters.)  It was so jarring that it distracted me throughout the movie. And come to think of it, all the characters were walking cliches. If not for Blanchett's performance, I'd probably rate this 2 stars. Allen's writing isn't even very good anymore.",1393891200,2,847,4.923076923076923

5831034,5,B00DL47RQ2,"This is a great film. The twist..the ""why"" of this story is missed by most people. Even me. At first.
It took a couple hours for it to sink in. When it finally hit me..I was blown away. What a great ""reveal"".
The question you need to ask (when considering the real meaning or point of the film) is..was Jasmine in on the theft of her sisters 200K? Did she know..her husband was a crook? And who was responsible for the husband going to jail and his death? Who did all that?
When you answer these questions the curtain is pulled back as to what this story is really about.

The movie seems to be about one thing...and it is..but the reason she went crazy was not his betrayal..but hers! She could not live with her revenge.
Her revenge and what it wrought...it destroyed her...is the point. She did it.

She was as immoral as her husband. And was in on the plot to cheat her sister.
You don't see any of this while watching the movie. You think she is the innocent dupe..till the end.
Even then you have to put it together. The key was the son's conversations with her.

This moral twist..was fantastic. When I first saw the movie I saw a different movie. It was the story of a person's breakdown and search for a new husband. But what it was really about the cost of revenge.
Sort of like ""Fight Club"". It seems like one sort of movie, but is actually a dark comedy disguised as the other movie.
Wow. It took about 4 hours for the plot to sink in to my brain. As usual it hit me in the shower where I get all my great ideas.
Blue Jasmine is a masterwork of film making. I was fascinated that like a puzzle it took time for my mind to ""solve"" the plot.",1393804800,,1651,4.169278996865204
5831035,5,B00DL47RQ2,I just enjoyed the film. The acting was great and it was classic Woody Allen. I am sorry I waited so long to see it.,1393804800,,116,3.68
5831036,5,B00DL47RQ2,"Probably wouldn't recommend to anyone from a small town or from Flyover Country, but it's a great movie for a person that can appreciate the story.

5831037,5,B00DL47RQ2,"A must see. Cate Blanchett is masterful at making you love to be annoyed with her character.
As a recovering alcoholic, I can say emphatically that her portrait of the narcissism and delusions of grandeur that are the hallmark of drunks are delivered spot on.

There is nothing to like about this movie.  If I was supposed to develop some sympathy for the main character, I missed whatever her redeeming qualities were supposed to be.  She was naive and self-absorbed in the worst sort of way with no hope for redemption.  Cate Blanchett portrayed that to a T, but that doesn't make it a movie worth any amount of time or money.

Overall, the movie was pointless and depressing.",1393804800,,509,4.738636363636363

5831068,4,B00DL47RQ2,"Cate Blanchett gives an Oscar-worthy performance in this drama by Woody Allen.  All the other players did a fine job as well.

The reason I did not give a 5-star rating? Woody is, as usual, out of touch with middle class Americans.  I feel like he makes all of his characters who don't live in NYC or have unlimited funds to spend on 'the good life' are treated simplistically and most often depicted as low-class without a cultured bone in their bodies.  Even Peter Sarsgaard's character, who had ""class"" - was totally unrealistic - he was a government employee who is redecorating a huge beautiful home on the ocean and doesn't plan to occupy the house for several years while he lives in Vienna? Give me a government job like that!!!",1393804800,7,736,4.595419847328245

Spend your money on something better. Blanchett gets nominated for anything she stars in just like Meryl Streep. She didn't deserve anything but criticism for this pathetic performance and movie. Stay away from any Woody Allen movie unless you suffer from insomnia .",1393804800,,424,4.902777777777778

She carried the story, the set and the performance.  Excellent!  Well deserved rewards, Cate.",1393804800,,256,5.375
5831071,3,B00DL47RQ2,"Well I note Cate Blanchett won best actress for this film--actually 3 awards.  I'm admirer of her as an actress which is why I watched the film.  I don't want to go into the plot in depth as you can read that in many places.  In short, she was the wife of a Wall Street con man (a Bernie Madoff or Wolf of Wall Street type, perfectly cast with Alec Baldwin) and when his Ponzi scheme comes crashing down she loses everything, but really can't accept it.  She flies from New York City to San Francisco to ""temporarily"" stay with her sister Ginger (they're supposed to have been adopted, so they aren't biological sibs) who has never lived the life of luxury that Jasmine did.  Ginger's been married and divorced once (I didn't recognize that was Andrew Dice Clay as her ex-husband) and struggles to support herself and her 2 boys working at a grocery store.  Recently she's gotten engaged to a man ""Chili"" who, though also of modest means, she thinks will make a loyal and hard-working husband for her and decent father-figure to her boys.

Jasmine, obviously alcoholic and also on psychiatric medications, cannot imagine ever stooping so low herself as to clerk at a grocery store, but also obviously hasn't held a job of significance her entire life.  She seems to feel somehow she just DESERVES to have a nice life, even if not quite as luxurious as what she had before.  She's also constantly telling Ginger that she shouldn't ""settle"" for a man like Chili (even in front of him, while he tries to bite his tongue).

Things seem to possibly turn brighter for both sisters when they go to a party.  An obviously wealthy man is very attracted to Jasmine, hires her to decorate a house he just bought in Marin, and soon asks her to marry him.  Ginger also meets a guy with an income one step above ""Chili"" who seems passionately attracted to her.

As the old saying goes, things that seem too good to be true usually are.  Ginger, basically with no unrealistic expectations for her life, clearly will bounce back, but at the end of the movie Jasmine looks like she's headed back to a psychiatric ward again (if not off the Golden Gate Bridge)...

Blanchett at the Academy Awards made mention of the makeup people who ""tried to make me look pretty every day"".  Actually it was more like the opposite.  Most days it seemed they had to make her look a lot LESS pretty than she actually is.  [The movie cuts back and forth between her days of wealth in NYC and hard times in SF so it's true, she looks great in NYC, but in San Francisco it's more about giving her the pink-eyed look and disheveled hair of someone with a hangover].

When she thanked Woody Allen for picking her for the part in his movie there was only light applause.  Allen's career began with brilliantly funny films, then went through his dark period in which he tried to make serious character studies that were some of the most depressing I've ever seen (or seen PARTS of!), then briefly back to comedy, then settled into....THIS.  Ever since moving to France, it seems to me rather like Oscar Wilde after fleeing England, he doesn't seem to have produced anything with the brilliance of his early career.  The same themes are still there, but much more subdued, almost the ghosts of old laughs and sorrows.  If the ghost of Woody Allen past is enough for you, then you will enjoy this.",1393804800,7,3354,4.534883720930233
5831072,5,B00DL47RQ2,"I loved this movie.

It is amazing how rich people can't handle falling out of that fake pedestal, then again poor people can't really handle becoming instant billionaire.  Its a difficult transition to have everything one day, the next day you have nothing.  I could understand why she had a nervous break down,  I even feel kind of sorry for her. Despite the fact that it was her ""hate"" and fear of being alone that caused her to lose everything.  She was the one who phoned the FBI after, her crook husband said he was leaving her.  So at the end mixed feelings, but she did an amazing job presenting human emotion, it was captivating.",1393804800,,773,4.510791366906475

I would have watched it sooner but I actually let the people who have posted bad reviews calling it a cheap rip-off of Streetcar Named Desire get to me. I should have known better. After watching this film I am SURE of one thing, the Amazon reviewers who said things like that have never seen Streetcar (or at the very least they didn't understand it).  Cate is amazing and deserved that Oscar. This is a very modern movie about what is going on right now. It is about how turned around and messed up a woman's life can get when everything she has revolves around an awful husband. Christ, even her step-son won't give her a break. But in spite of her breakdown, she has one moment of clarity.

5831098,5,B00DL47RQ2,I really liked this movie because style and storyline of movie reminded me of earlier Woody Allen movies.  His characters are complex trying to work out their personal issues.  I think that one of my favorite character's was the first husband of Jasmine's sister.  The scene where he runs into Jasmine on the street felt like a ghost from the past reminded Jasmine that not everyone can forget the past so easily.  Also her stepson felt like another ghost reminding Jasmine sometimes you cannot undue your mistakes.  The damage is done. I think that Woody Allen's movies reminds us that we can laugh even in the darkest moments of our lives.  We can always find some humor and irony.,1393718400,,683,4.697478991596639

5831139,5,B00DL47RQ2,"""Blue Jasmine"" is one of Woody Allen's bravest and most uncompromising portraits of the human tragicomedy--an acidic account of raw ambition and prideful delusion, the fatal Achilles heels of humanity. In the performance of Cate Blanchett it ultimately attains the poignancy of tragedy. For anything comparably honest in Allen's delineation of a woman trapped in hubris and illusion and isolation, only ""The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne"" and ""Come Back, Little Sheba"" qualify. ""Blue Jasmine's"" profound and despairing view of human relationships places it alongside Ingmar Bergman's finest, as well as Edward Albee's ""Who' Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" and Allen's own ""Interiors.""

She is an extraordinary actress who seems to completely disappear into any role she plays and this film is another example.  Unfortunately, it lacks any real story line.  Blanchett's character is the self-indulged widow of a former securities swindler who lost her rich and privileged lifestyle when her husband went to prison and committed suicide.  That's the premise for a character study of a woman who is completely lost and cannot cope with her diminished status and lack of money and has virtually no compassion for anyone else.  Ms. Blanchett's performance rates 5 stars, but the movie barely rates 3.  I wish Woody Allen would go back to making funny films instead of trying to be an auteur.",1393459200,2,779,4.908396946564886

5831230,5,B00DL47RQ2,"Ok I'll admit it: I'm not a fan of Woody Allen and because of that I nearly missed this gem of a movie.  First off, it's not a laugh-out-loud comedy (though it does have its funny moments).  I would describe this as a melodrama that provides an inside glimpse into the stunningly different worlds that people inhabit that are galaxies apart due to class divisions, mores, anxieties, and neurosis.

And yet, at the same time it's about universal qualities of being that are common to us all: to be liked, to be respected, to accomplish, to be validated, and to be honest. The quest for the perfect partner.  Well, maybe not perfect.  Maybe not even faithful.  Simply authentic?

All the performances are good.  The music is jazzily tongue in cheek.  The costumes and sets are perfect.  The plot is intriguing.  THE PRIMARY REASON YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM, however,  IS FOR THE OUTSTANDING JOB DONE BY CATE BLANCHETT.  It's nuanced, realistic, and nothing short of Oscar award winning.  Her performance keeps the pace, the surprise,  and takes the audience from one emotional spectrum to another that will have you reflecting on her character well after the credits roll.  Definitely worth repeat viewings.  Simply excellent (despite Allen and his gimmicky directing esp w/the overuse of flashbacks and the one dimensional treatment of Baldwin's character).",1393113600,2,1353,4.995515695067264

5831234,5,B00DL47RQ2,"Woody Allen has always been enigmatic to me.  He's made absolutely brilliant films like ""Bananas"", ""Manhattan"", ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", and ""Bullets Over Broadway"".  Good ones like ""Radio Days"" and ""Mighty Aphrodite"".  Overrated ones like ""Annie Hall"" and ""Midnight in Paris"".  Terrible ones like ""Celebrity"" and ""Melinda and Melinda"".  He even repeated himself with ""Match Point"" which was wholly derivative of ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"".  Despite the unevenness of his output you cannot deny his artistry.  This frustration with Allen made ""Blue Jasmine"" a complete surprise to me.  It is a virtually flawless film.  Unlike past endeavors Allen isn't repeating himself but actually treading new ground as a filmmaker which is amazing when you consider that he is in the twilight of his years.  Sure the black-and-white opening credits heralding the cast in alphabetic order are there and the old time blues standards trumpeted on the soundtrack is present but other than that you wouldn't know this is a Woody Allen film.  The structure of the film is ingenious the way Allen flashes back in forth in time allowing us to see how Jasmine(Cate Blanchett) fell from grace in her old life as a New York socialite and is headed for the same fate in her new life in San Francisco.  Allen is abetted by probably the best cast he's assembled in years led by Blanchett who is nothing short of a wonder for her work here.  Your jaw will drop watching Blanchett walk and talk and pop Xanax like they were Tic Tacs.  Anybody who can make you sympathize for a self-absorbed snob is deserving of an Oscar.  Sally Hawkins offers terrific support as Jasmine's blue collar sister, Ginger.  And who would have thought that casting Andrew Dice Clay and Louis C.K. in a Woody Allen film would be a stroke of genius?.

This is the case with Blue Jasmine, Woody Allen's Blanche Dubois tribute. Cate Blanchett's character is difficult to sympathize with and it is difficult to watch her spiral into a breakdown.  Great supporting cast, so many themes, why only 3 stars? It's uncomfortable to watch, my wife bailed half way thru, fed up with main character's selfishness and vanity.

You can still tell it is a Woody Allen movie, some of the secondary characters are clear reincarnations of previous ones, but the dialogues, the actuality of the story, and most of all the stunning work of Cate Blanchett, the excellent use of flashbacks and editing and the choice of music to create the sad but at the same time upbeat atmosphere elevates this picture to a truly master piece.  I can't possibly imagine how it is not right there as Best Movie. There is nothing than 12 Years or Dallas Club or Gravity has above this movie.  It can't possibly be nobody else picking up the Oscar as Best Actress than Cate Blanchett.  Her work is more than spectacular.

5831285,5,B00DL47RQ2,"To watch Blue Jasmine you have to like Woody. Cate Blanchette, who so far won a BAFTA for the role is directed to act like a neurotic person. Any of the movies Woody has appeared in himself, he is your stereotypical Neurotic New York Jewish person. Most of his characters again have neuroses, though although they are not Jewish. The film is full of likeable actors, like Ms. Blanchette and Alec Baldwin as Jasmine's husband. The surprise was the first time turn as Jasmine's sister, Sally Hawkins, who is up for Best Supporting Actress at this year's Oscars,. Over the years, Mr. Allen has built a stock company of actors,such as Rob Reiner, Julie Kavner and Joy Behar. Another standout in the film is the soundtrack of the film, with the exception of Louis Armstrong, most of the singers of the jazz tunes are unknown to me in particular. That goes along with the fact that Mr. Allen never attends the Oscars and on Monday night perfers to keep his regular gig in New York.
The reason I titled my review as I did is the character of Jasmine has one messed up life and comes to stay with her sister, Ginger, played by Ms. Hawkins. Although not all of it is belly laughter material it is very funny, but you do have to like Woody Allen movies. Cate Blanchette, who most people associate with period pieces like playing the first, Queen Elizabeth, she is more than up to the challenge. I think you will understand after seeing the film, why I gave it five stars.",1392854400,,1461,4.496240601503759

5831288,4,B00DL47RQ2,"Woody Allen's ""Blue Jasmine"" is his seriocomic take on a Bernie Madoff-like scam artist named Hal, who cons people out of their savings with smooth-talking charm.  Alec Baldwin plays the narcissistic Hal with his trademark smarminess.  The talented Cate Blanchett is Hal's wife, Jasmine, who is more intelligent that she lets on.  She airily announces to her friends that she routinely turns a blind eye to her husband's dodgy financial affairs.  As time goes by, however, Hal's indiscretions become so blatant that Jasmine can no longer shrug them off.  When she is forced to face some unpleasant truths, she makes a life-changing decision that will have far-reaching consequences.

Written and directed by Woody Allen, with a jazz score that underscores the action, ""Blue Jasmine"" features scenes of farcical comedy and heartbreaking tragedy.  Allen shifts back and forth between the ""good"" years--when Hal and Jasmine enjoyed a life of ease and excess--and the aftermath of their downfall. Blanchett hits all the right notes, portraying Jasmine as a woman who regrets having made bad choices but wants desperately to regain her dignity and sanity.  Can she overcome her guilt, confusion, and shattered self-esteem?

The humor stems partly from the strained relationship that Jasmine has with her good-hearted but nave sister, Ginger (Sally Hawkins), who is Jasmine's polar opposite.  Although she has ample reason to give Jasmine a wide berth, Ginger, a working class divorc&eacute;e with two kids, graciously welcomes her elegant and beautiful sibling into her apartment.  Jasmine claims to be grateful for her sister's hospitality, but cannot hide her contempt for Ginger's blue-collar lifestyle and loud-mouthed boyfriend. A series of misadventures ensue that are both hilarious and horrible.

Blanchette is a scene stealer who is sophisticated and articulate one minute and outrageously scatterbrained the next.  It is hilarious and pathetic to observe her providing the details of her mental deterioration to Ginger's obnoxious sons.  Nor does Jasmine's reliance on Xanax and booze enhance her flawed judgment. Allen's heavy-handed plot has its share of flaws, including some far-fetched and melodramatic elements, but ""Blue Jasmine"" is worth seeing, mostly for Blanchett's stunning and poignant performance. The film is notable, as well, for its satirical, engrossing, and disconcerting exploration of the ways in which greed, selfishness, and stupidity can bring high-flying individuals crashing down to earth.",1392768000,3,2520,5.56282722513089

5831309,1,B00DL47RQ2,It's like being with annoying and crazy people in real time.  I couldn't take it  NOTHING happens -it's just people in pain and a film maker thinking that it might be funny to judge emotionally wounded and unstable people.  Really awful unless you like visiting mental hospitals for your amusement.,1392768000,,298,4.92
5831310,2,B00DL47RQ2,"I checked this out from the library. I'd placed a hold on it long before Mr. Allen's adult daughter made allegations of child abuse and so when it became available, I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch it. On one hand I've been raised that people are innocent until proven guilty; on the other hand, I read weekly about child sex abuse here and around the world. Just read recently where young Mexican children are kidnapped from their villages by sex slavers. Appalling. What I decided was to look at this film, but because of the allegations, I'd prefer to not request other works by Mr. Allen from the library.  Hopefully the allegations will be cleared up truthfully.

The story is sad. A woman who thought she was wealthy comes to find out that not only is she not wealthy but her husband is a lying, cheating con artist. Now she knew that, sort of. She knew but was in denial. She wanted a pretty life and so she pretended to herself and to everyone else that she didn't know. She actually asked him about it and he denied it and she chose to believe him. Cate Blanchett is wonderful as usual and I love Sally Hawkins. I think her character was tolerable because we saw her asking her husband about his faithfulness to her and about allegations of shady business deals and he blew her off, and just flat out lied and she wanted to believe him, and so did. Her character was clearly enough written and understandable. I don't think her sister's character was written clearly enough. There was alot of talk about her not being as good in certain areas as Jasmine and she seemed to accept that and even mentioned it herself, but perhaps she was just hiding her anger. I think she needed to show her anger more clearly, but Sally did a good job with her anyway.

All the acting was good. I thought it was not very believable the way Jasmine's new beau found out about her lying: I think the story would've worked better had he discovered her lies post-marriage. I suspect Mr. Allen the writer just didn't want Jasmine to fall on her feet, but I think the story would've worked better if both Jasmine and her beau were revealed to be liars. I felt sorry for Jasmine but I wasn't emotionally engaged by her and I didn't understand her sister and their relationship. Had the Sally Hawkins character been jealous or angry I would've understood, but though she was somewhat angry that her sister's husband stole her nest egg she didn't really seem to blame her sister. I would've liked more room in the story for Sally's character. I felt sorry most for Jasmine because her life's setbacks caused her to become mentally unstable and there was no evidence in the story that she'd be getting help with that.

The sister's relationship didn't work for me. Also didn't like the structure or what happened in the story. After the sister arrived in San Francisco, the guts of the story, the relationships of the sisters and their new men, was presented in a surface way, they weren't interesting as couples. It was as if Mr. Allen disliked the characters and so didn't present the individuals in their new relationships clearly: as if he didn't want to know them. Or perhaps he disliked them so much he didn't want to show them. This didn't make me dislike them, it made me not understand them. Jasmine was desperate, I understood that, but I didn't understand Sally tumbling into bed with a stranger who complimented her a few times.

The two sisters met two guys, they hopped into bed with them knowing nothing about the men as individuals. Perhaps Mr. Allen was trying to show the Sally Hawkins character was so insecure, a few compliments was all it took to seduce her. That's probably what he was trying to show, but I wish he'd have done it earlier, and differently, so that I understood her better before she cheated on her boyfriend.

I also disliked the story's build up: after Jasmine lied to her new beau I just kept waiting for him to be revealed as a con artist too. I didn't care for the second act or the setup and conclusion of the second act.

This almost reminds me of Mr. Allen's Match Point (which I don't really remember very well). I think the two leads in Match Point were unsympathetic characters but I think they were more sympathetic than Jasmine and her sister.

Overall I'd say it's kind of hard to like characters if the writer doesn't like them. Jasmine was more sympathetic to me, mostly because she became mentally unstable and with no one to help her. Her sister was not well written.",1392768000,,4506,4.533825338253383
5831311,4,B00DL47RQ2,Cate Blanchett is amazing. The supporting cast is really good as well but what a standout performance she gives. Woody Allen brings out something in actors that no other director does consistently. No wonder why they all want to work with him.,1392681600,,243,4.809523809523809

5831316,3,B00DL47RQ2,"BLUE JASMINE is a veritable parody of A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE by Tennessee Williams.  That his audience should attach tragic meaning to Blanche DuBois's pitiful fate, Williams creates characters who embody the strengths of their social strata, and he gives them all moments of searing insight.  BLUE JASMINE does not lament the demise of cultivation and gentility; it does not explore the perils of naivete.  Instead, it exposes in ruthless caricature the means by which a beautiful and brainless alcoholic destroys, nearly destroys, or tries to destroy, those closest to her, and thus herself, in relentless pursuit of her next drink.  Allen's narrative treads the long dull path from an ingenue's bumptious inebriety to a widow's exhausted delirium.  Allen's script and cinematography paint such a bleak portrait of rich and poor, young and old, male and female, that BLUE JASMINE might be described aptly as a biting farce.  I believe BLUE JASMINE's principal artistic value will prove to be that it drives some people NOT to drink.",1392681600,3,1036,5.173652694610778

With the exception of the character Augie played by Andrew Dice Clay.none of the male characters were at all sympathetic.  He did a wonderful job of playing a Bronx blue collar guy.  Trouble is that he was supposed to be a native of San Francisco.

5831326,5,B00DL47RQ2,"Sooo much more substantial than fluff like ""Midnight In Paris."" This is Woody back in Bergman mode, a bit overwrought in bright color and on-the-nose dialogue to get through to those not already in the existential choir, but forgivable because he has points worth making that are otherwise tuned out by mass audiences.

Cate Blanchett is at her best! Spectacularly committed in her performance, deft with subtleties in a character so obviously collapsing under a mental breakdown. She channels a bit of Charlotte Rampling from ""Stardust Memories"" and Judy Davis from ""Husbands & Wives"" which actually hits the same perfect note of tiger strength personality in a tragically fractured vessel. Wonderfully directed with a well written character, she'll no doubt & rightfully win the Oscar.

Terrific performances by the supporting cast as well.  Louie C.K. has a small role he manages to pack with believability and charm.

It's such a pleasure to see Woody write & direct without succumbing to vanity and injecting himself onto the screen. He was once the perfect actor for his movies, but now his physical image smells too much of the decay his younger self only projected philosophically. I  hope he continues to wield his supple and vigorous mind behind the camera, as no other American filmmaker peers into & conveys the abyss better than he in exploring isolation and pain. If we're all lucky he'll continue down this road and never waste his time on mere fluff comedy again.",1392681600,2,1479,5.020408163265306
5831327,2,B00DL47RQ2,"Viewers - including critics - seem to like or dislike Blue Jasmine for any number of reasons other than the quality of the film itself.  Some, having seen so many of Cate Blanchett's strong performances in the past, are eager to heap praise on her portrayal of the disintegrating ex-wife of a Bernie Madoff type con man.  Others praise or pan this film based on their feelings regarding writer/director Woody Allen.  Some, having seen press releases saying that Blue Jasmine is a modern version of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" are afraid to offer it anything other than fulsome praise.  It's the film folks, the film... and it's not particularly good.

Cate Blanchett does a workmanlike job in this film; she is solid as the unstable Jasmine, but not spectacular.  Put away all flowery adjectives for another day.  Blanchett's brittle reactions work well, but don't require her to stretch beyond her previous performances.  She has portrayed Americans so often that the accent must be like a comfy old coat for her.  No points there.

Woody Allen has obviously admired ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" for a long time; he gave a humorous performance as Blanche in his funny-era ""Sleeper.""  But did he deliver any fresh insights by modernizing it?  No.  How about:  ""We are all frauds to some degree, hiding behind our own pretensions""?  Nope; that's not new.  How about: ""The happiest person is someone who knows his place, however lowly""?  Nope; it's downright offensive for Americans too.  That ""know your place"" nonsense is fine for the British, but not for a nation of strivers.  Of course, since Allen stopped parodying the pretentious and joined them, I've wished that he stopped striving too.  Oh, well...  One can dream.

In any case, Blanchett will go on, one day possibly meriting the praise she received for this film.  And Allen's ""Midnight in Paris"" shows that he hasn't completely forgotten his sense of humor.  And one desperately needs it after viewing a ""Match Point"" or ""Blue Jasmine.""",1392595200,,1995,4.9397590361445785

5831362,3,B00DL47RQ2,"You'd have to say that Woody Allen is crafting more and more tight and powerful dramas.  He has subtlety that other directors lack.  He doesn't do gangster films or fantasies, but sticks to dramas that potentially say something about real life: genuine mirrors.  The problem with Blue Jasmine and Matchpoint is there is not a catharsis or something positive to reflect on.  Shakespeare evolved to tragicomedy where there are evil and error present, but there are also redemptive forces at work.  This makes for more satisfying drama.  The music he uses suggests comedy or cruelty -- I'm not sure which.  It seems to point to the central flaw in the work.  He hedges.

Despite these weaknesses, the acting and directing seem to place him in a league by himself.  The films come off as pellucid.  Polanski is a worthy rival.  If only he could get some material that evokes Bergman's purgatory and paradise at work and not just a Woody hell that would be best.  Scorsese, albeit with gangster films (like Casino), achieves these dimensions; and, the Coen brothers in a movie like Fargo (or Barton Fink) achieve it in spades; the former ranks as a classic because of subtle tragicomedy, redemptive features, and the thorough purge involved.

All this said, he does provide relevant cautionary tales with some morally pertinent over and under tones in these mature, late works.  In Blue Jasmine the wise words are don't get to far ahead of the crowd and your past; in Matchpoint it might be adultery is ever dangerous.

Suggestion Woody: make King Lear with Daniel Day Lewis and some of those female actors you use so well.  Do it.  Do it now.  It's a natural for our time: aging parents cruelly trying to control children while keeping the house and croissants.  The best is to have the action take place in Florida during a hurricane brought about by global warming.  The storm scene would have Donald Trump standing in the cross-section of a highway with a stalled car out in the winds talking to a reporter, his fool, with some locals (Gloucester and Kent) trying to coax them in from the cameras and there ever vain glory.  Have the astrophysicist Tyson, science, be Edgar and the cure, purge, and redeeming clear air.",1392595200,3,2218,4.766404199475065

These things were hugely distracting for a San Francisco native (and probably for anyone with limited means). Kate's performance and character were moderately interesting, but they were completely upstaged with the asynchronous backdrop.",1392508800,7,555,5.851851851851852
5831367,4,B00DL47RQ2,"Woody Allen who, when abroad, often seems to be looking down at the rest of the world through the double-glazed windows of a five-star hotel, is back, feet on home ground, for this onethe story of two very diverse siblings, a subject he examined once before with great success in Hannah and Her Sisters, 1986. For this film, he apparently  has found inspiration in the great 1947 Tennessee Williams drama, Streetcar Named Desire, but with a slight difference. Here Blanche DuBois, *after* a nervous breakdown, rather than before, seeks refuge in the home of her sister, the Stella character, who is engaged but not yet married a Stanley Kowalksi. San Francisco stands in, sunnily, for Williams New Orleans., but much of what happens in the plot is the same.

These borrowings, intentional or not, work splendidly thanks to the inspired casting: the two American sisters are played brilliantly by Melbourne-born Cate Blanchard, and by Dulwichs Sally Hawkins. Kowalski is Brooklyns stand up, Andrew Dice Clay.

The sisters accents are perfect, as is the photography, and choice of location. Structurally, Allen moves back and forth in time and place in a way he was rarely tried before, and the overall emotional effect is powerfully affective This is one of Woodys most accomplished films in many years.  Less gags, more insight into what makes people tick even when the clock won't work.",1392508800,,1387,5.017391304347826

5831369,2,B00DL47RQ2,"This movie shows how little Woody Allen knows about blue collar workers and ordinary life.  Woody seems pretty much in his element in the scenes with wealthy people.  His presentation of plumbers and workers and even dentists is ridiculous to the point of being insulting. As if to really show off how little he knows about ordinary people, Woody has Jasmine struggling to learn how to use computers so she can take an Interior Design class online.  We realize Jasmine's idea that she could really benefit from such a class is laughable, but what is even more laughable is Woody's idea that learning to point and click involves taking lengthy, mind-stumping, textbook-reading computer classes. To make matters worse, the musical soundtrack of the film is from the 20's or 30's--I am guessing Woody thinks this music is classy even though it has nothing to do with the emotional content of the film.",1392508800,,898,4.894736842105263
5831370,2,B00DL47RQ2,"Yeah, I don't get the fascination with Woody Allen movies. The characters from all his movies could easily intermingle with each other among his films and be right at home...they all seem to be cut from the same cloth. As with main characters in his other movies, the one here, Jasmine, suffers from a major case of discontentment as her life spins out of control. She's a stereotypical society wife, all about superficiality and appearances. I found it a bit 'Twilight Zone' creepy. When she feels she is wronged, she exacts revenge which has further devastating consequences for her.  About half way through the movie, I worried that the ending would be predictable, and guess what. It was. It left me feeling like the movie was rather pointless and that this story has been told before.  So nothing new here.  And somewhat depressing.",1392508800,,837,4.839160839160839

Because of this and to his credit, scenes and conversation work extremely well.  Something I thought particularly clever was Mr. Allen's use of wardrobe to emphasize the mental or emotional status of the main character played by Ms. Blanchett.  This may have served him and his cast well as to never allow the matter at hand to drag or become boring.  It cut out the need to find a way to otherwise insert such important details which can be cumbersome or cause the movie to be overplayed and even fail.  No failure here.

5831374,5,B00DL47RQ2,"Cate Blanchett gives a devastating performance as Jasmine in Woody Allen's latest production. Her nuanced portrayal of a woman whose life is in the process of disintegration is so convincing that we experience her inner turmoil sometimes merely through a glance, a glint in her eye, as in the disturbing scene in which she is presenting a self-serving justification of her life to her nephews, frightening them in the process.

The story, told in flashbacks that reflect Jasmine's fragmentation of her life, moves between a rather seedy San Francisco and an elegant New York. A story for our troubled economic times, it pays homage to Tennessee Williams' ""Streetcar Named Desire"", in that Allen presents a similar dynamic between two sisters, one, well brought up, who has ostensibly married 'well', and the other, of low self-esteem, who has made a series of marital or near-marital blunders. Like Williams' Blanche du Bois, Jasmine, who is paying an extended visit to her sister, considers the latter's boyfriend uncouth. Like Blanche, Jasmine, who seems to have developed a borderline personality, has erased all the sordid events of the past from her memory banks, although like a victim of post-traumatic stress, they have a way of intruding onto her consciousness when she least expects them. Like Blanche, she tries to start over with a plausibly respectable man; and like Blanche, her past impinges suddenly onto the present, shattering her hopes which have been built on a foundation of fantasy.

See this film for Cate Blanchette's remarkable portrayal of a flawed woman who both fascinates and horrifies us, since, in these turbulent economic times, she could very will be someone we know, if not some version of ourselves.",1392508800,2,1734,5.1453900709219855
5831375,3,B00DL47RQ2,"I finally got around to seeing the much talked about Woody Allen film Blue Jasmine. Unlike its inspiration, A Streetcar Named Desire, it is not a well crafted film. The photography is so so. The acting is better, but I'm not a big fan of improvised dialogue, which in this film is flat, a bit awkward and used to carry scenes that echo moments in Streetcar, but without the depth and pathos. Jasmine, the main character based on Blanche Dubois, to me is unsympathetic, void of any real charm and shallow. Where Blanche is the passionate, multidimensional, faded southern belle, infusing life with poetry - exquisite sexual outlaw, an outcast because of her intelligence and ahead of her time, Jasmine shares none of this. Instead she is just a snobby rich bitch, not innocent, who merits her fall from grace. She cheapens the memory of Blanche. I was hoping for so much more. Oh, there are some moments where the acting shines, how can it not with so much talent? But there were also moments where I cringed over gratuitous scenes attempting to parallel the masterpiece when it became almost a parody. In its adherence to the plot, Allen misses out on real opportunities to explore relationships not in the original story such as the one between Jasmine and her son. The musical score is horrendous (as long as Allen was stealing the story line, why not have something like the original Alex North soundtrack)? Allen's attempt to update William's tragic story especially falls short because Jasmine, for all its similarities to Streetcar is missing one key ingredient... brilliance. Allen's Bergman imitation, Interiors, holds up on its own. I'm not so sure this one does and in fact if this film had been made by an unknown director, it would have most likely gone unnoticed.",1392508800,,1776,4.826229508196722

Blanchett's character is the titular Jasmine, and she over talks and over indicates each and every scene.  Allen populates San Francisco with a bunch of talky New Yorkers.  He spruces up the city, Allen-style, and gives the film a jazzy soundtrack.  Alec Baldwin salvages the film, but we wish his fraudulent money man responsible for Jasmine's penurious straits (he's jailed and assets seized), was the central character.  Finally, and it must be said, Woody's dialogue has jumped the shark.  Every female character sounds like a Mia Farrow whine.  Shut up!  Stop talking.",1392422400,2,739,5.1344537815126055

But all of the other characters also feel like they are from NY, none seem like someone you would meet in SF. It was so weird to see interactions in the Sunset for example with people acting like they are in Manhattan.

This movie, craftily written, could have been a nameless Woody Allen flop.  With little direction and normally taking only one cut, Blanchett did what she knew could propel the character to heights rarely seen.  She resurrected the lead from ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", but with her subtle eccentricities shows us a performance worthy of multiple Oscars.  You may not remember Blue Jasmine as a great movie.  You will remember a great actress when you see Cate Blanchett any number of years from now.  Allen wrote the character.  That's why the movie gets my highest honor.

5831424,3,B00DL47RQ2,"Woody Allens Blue Jasmine is essentially A Streetcar Named Desire with flashbacks and a slightly altered back story. Jasmine is a booze-swilling, truth-bending, mentally unstable socialite who is forced to move in with her lower-class sister, Ginger (Sally Hawkins), after she falls on hard times, a result of her scheming, womanizing Bernie Madoff of a husband (Alec Baldwin) being imprisoned for fraud and subsequently committing suicide. Gingers boyfriend, Chili (Bobby Cannavale), is the rude, crude Stanley Kowalski of the piece who resents Jasmines sudden intrusion into the couples life.

Despite serving as a showcase for a bravura performance by Cate Blanchett, Blue Jasmine is clearly one of Allens lesser works of recent times. This isn't the first time that Allen has reached back to the classics for inspiration, yet, since hes borrowing much of his themes and insights from Tennessee Williams anyway, why not at least apply some of his trademark comic spin to the material? Alas, humor is strangely lacking in much of the screenplay, which plays out the class conflict between Jasmine and Chili in largely predictable fashion.

What makes Blue Jasmine ultimately worth checking out, however, is Blanchetts richly textured portrait of a woman who has always been too willing to put her fate in the hands of others, principally men, and too willing to look the other way when not to do so could jeopardize her own position of privilege in society. She is clearly a woman who refuses to take even the slightest bit of responsibility for any of the choices shes made in her life. Yet, for all her oddball attributes, Jasmine, thanks to Ms. Banchett, cant help but touch the viewers heart with her air of unquiet desperation. Jasmine may be utterly self-absorbed, but one senses that she speaks constantly about herself and her tribulations to anyone wholl listen (and even to those who wont) for the simple reason that, to her mind at least, if she were ever to stop doing so, she would simply cease to exist as an entity in the world.

In a large cast, Louis C.K. and Peter Sarsgaard provide additional love interests for Ginger and Jasmine, respectively.

The parallels to Streetcar are numerous but by no means slavish (Stanley here is a much more decent fella overall and Mitch is not one of his buddies), but the movie is at its best when it moves away from those parallels and heads off in its own direction, freeing Blanchett up to do her own thing.",1392249600,,2466,4.906474820143885

I think Woody Allen is brilliant, and I've been a fan since What's New Pussycat. ""Annie Hall"" and ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" are two of my all time favorite movies. I have always appreciated and applauded his quest to create more serious films a la Bergman, even while mourning his abandonment of his Groucho Marx muse (he's responsible for the funniest lines EVER uttered in any film!); that's his prerogative as an artist.

I always love when foreign actors do American accents and Ms. Blanchett does the NY Socialite to perfection.  But to see her unfold into a sad mental state was the seal to Oscar nomination.

Woody Allen takes from current trends -- false wealth and social climbing (Madoff, Enron, Real Housewives of anywhere) -- mixes it with A Streetcar Named Desire and serves us a movie that tells a lot about us today.

5831514,4,B00DL47RQ2,"* There's no need to go into my problems with this film, from its non-linear structure - to its jarring Jersey accents in a San Francisco setting - to its ""perky"" jazz soundtrack laid over scenes of emotional trauma.

* However, for viewers upset about the darkness throughout this film, and its lack of an emotionally satisfying ending, or more to the point, the lack of any ending at all, I say it's better to frame this picture as a portrait of desperation, of how you can be wealthy with status and condescension towards others - and still end up being mentally ill, hooked on pills and alcohol, mumbling to yourself on a park bench, shunned by strangers.

* The last shot in ""Blue Jasmine"" felt stunning to me, the irrationality of what Jasmine (Cate Blanchett) says, how she says it - juxtaposed with how raggedly terrible and old she looks after appearing spectacularly elegant throughout the film.  In my view, how a second person in that last shot behaves toward Jasmine, without saying one word - before the screen goes suddenly black - told me enough about what's going to happen to Jasmine, without needing to see it.  The decision to NOT ""tie up loose ends"" feels intentional, leaving some viewers justifiably angry about being deprived an ending.

* I don't think it's helpful to compare this movie to ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" - nor to read national critics praising this film.  Expectations matter.  Your complaints are justified.  To me, ""Blue Jasmine"" is a sketchy story about how an unlikeable and snobby woman - after losing all of her money - will do ANYTHING to climb her way back up the status ladder.  It's one version of how quickly a person can fall from the penthouse to the outhouse, ending up like some homeless person who looks deranged, doped up and dangerous, babbling to herself - without projecting any suggestion of a past once filled with prestige and glamour.

* So who's the real loser if your self-worth is defined by money and material things - and not by love and forgiveness - which Jasmine's sister Ginger (Sally Hawkins) has by the truckload?  Despite the low opinion Jasmine has for ""unsophisticated"" Ginger, who's a single mother living from paycheck-to-paycheck - who dates men who are, in Jasmine's view, ""losers"" - Ginger won't be dragged down.  She may not be rich nor stylish, but you're not going to find Ginger dependent on drugs and alcohol, emotionally devastated and homeless on the streets.

* Yeah, Cate Blanchett's performance is electric.  Her facial expressions, her ability to suggest bravado, arrogance and crippling self-doubt - are off the charts spectacular.  I never got the impression she was delivering lines from memory.  The scene where she's ""baby-sitting"" her sister's kids in a restaurant, ""confiding"" shallow pearls of wisdom about the human condition and about her own situation - illustrates the extent of her increasing madness.

* But given the rave reviews from critics and the depressingly mixed reactions from audiences, I went in with low expectations.  I'm glad I did.  ""Blue Jasmine"" - despite its flaws - is an insanely watchable story about a human train wreck without wheels.",1391904000,,3164,4.880373831775701

The movie is incredibly well supported by all the actors- There is no surprise there- But, I fail to see the purpose for such a depressing and pointless movie that could of had great potential- Mr. Allen with all his creative talent could have come to a conclusion in a humorous manner (which by the was, Blue Jasmine does have) and have an uplifting ending that would not leave you hanging- Instead, one is left empty at the end of the film- At least, for me, it did leave me empty- Much in the same tune of his ""Purple Rose of Cairo""- I seldom take time to write reviews, but compelled to do so this time- Regretfully, I purchased the film and spend time that will not come back watching it.

The dnouement comes with Alec Baldwin being arrested on a sidewalk in Manhattan; that just knocks you for the final count.

And what a lot of adoptive adults/children lurking around the place.  Doesn't anybody have their own kids or is it too difficult for them? Oh, that's right: any fool can die, being born is rather tricky.  I suppose it is so similar to Allen's own personal complexities.  If you are looking for a Debbie Macomber story, this might not be the movie for you.

Don't you think Allen is ridiculing all these shallow people for their baseness and mountaneus heap of shortcomings?  The pill popping (was it zanax or valium, perhaps both) and constant drinking; the flying first class out was a stitch, with the poor old lady having her ear yacked off.  Kate reminds me of Mia Farrow.

And lastly, just a side note: Graham Greene was pursued and trampled upon for the remainder of his life after writing  an aticle, I think in the New Yorker about 1936, about the Shirley Temple movies and how the child, at the time, was an object of sexual fancy for older men.  Decades later Graham Greene was vindicated and shown to have been one hundred percent correct.  Woody Allen is in that exact spot...think about it.

But when it came to watching Blue Jasmine, I was so surprised by how dark the film was and never would I have thought it was one of Woody's recent projects. Nonetheless, I must say I was so impressed by the well rounded talent of superb acting and mainly, by Woody's courage to take a different turn in his style of movies compared to what we know him for and expose the a perspective that is untouched and pure. The mood of humor is definitely darker, but the amount of reality that is portrayed in this movie is so raw and truthful because I believe, no matter where are coming from, we can once again find a reflection of ourselves when as we face who we really are and what gives us stability, sanity, and comfort.

Otherwise, I will advise that this film overall is like drinking flat soda.  It gets the job done - it's a movie... there's a beginning, a middle and an end, but the story was not interesting.  The plot line was very flat.  Not Allen nor Blanchett or anyone else did anything to make me feel like I should care about any of the characters at all.  The biggest problem I had was that a lot what was probably the more interesting story lines happen off camera through the narration.  Sure, Cate did a great job in her performance of a mentally disturbed woman but I don't buy into the difficult nature of capturing the character when she has hysterics.  It was no Girl Interrupted or Mommy Dearest performance.

She ends up more or less without a penny and suddenly has to rebuild her life by moving in with her sister who lives check to check.

In going beyond the obvious and the many different takes on the film, many of them accurate, in the end as Jasmine sat on the park bench a truly broken woman, I felt sad for her.

Even her boyfriend's cry in the grocery market is reminiscent of Marlon Brando's cry, ""Stella, I love you."" What seems clear though is that not much appears to have changed from the days of post Civil War America and the 21st century as far has relationships between men and women go--women still appear heavily dependent on men for emotional stability and prosperity and men still reserve the right to rip phones off walls in a fit of temper, have affairs.",1391299200,3,770,4.711111111111111

Does she disintegrate further? What happens to Jasmin? Watch and find out.

I knew a person like this . . . family like this. All too real. While I would say it is probably more common than not I wonder how much of this was  influence by Tennessee Williams' A Street Car Named Desire? Very similar plot and characters. But then again like I said the personality is pretty common. The Hollywood fictional aspect to this movie is SF. You cannot bag groceries and live in a spacious apartment in SF with two kids. Sorry. Also how many straight people are there in SF in actuality living out normal like lives? It is definitely a minority. Nice idea that SF is the SF of the early 70s and before. But it really isn't. Even where straights exist it is the upper class that you would not interact with or the single workaholics (out of necessity to live in SF) that are involved in normal life as most people know it and as is portrayed in NY. Not to beat the proverbial dead horse but if you sat down beside someone in SF that was talking to himself you wouldn't get creeped out and stare. It is to be expected. Same if you were walking down the street and saw someone doing that . . . you wouldn't stop and stare. That is SF . . . and you would know it unless you were a tourist, even then I think its rep precedes it. Sorry it is true f rom my experience living there, having friends there, spending a lot of time there. It is the city. Also the interview with the cast extras shows that people are making a bigger deal out of this movie than it deserves. I guess it is their industry trying to maintain the atmosphere to stay employed.

This is a tale of the rich and the poor.  I won't spoil anything but the characters fit perfectly in our present economic system.

5831760,5,B00DL47RQ2,"Blue Jasmine is a rare film, one in which the script is as brilliant as the casting, as are the actors.
The story depicts present day America, and its tremendous economic/class disparity. Two adopted children are raised by parents who have entirely different expectations for each, daughters: Cate Blanchett as Jasmine, Sally Hawkins, Ginger.
Jasmine is cultivated to achieve-- superficially, while it appears that there were no expectations for Ginger. Fast forward: Jasmine successfully positions herself as an elite member of society, while Ginger scrapes by. Jasmine is very condescending, aloof and judgmental about Ginger, but when Jasmine's pretentious life implodes, it is Ginger whom she seeks out.
If you have ever observed people who cloak themselves in a stereotypical display of wealth, while others have no pretensions, Blue Jasmine delineates this theme.
Blue Jasmine is a film one can watch multiple times, and each time observe more of the subtle innuendo, and appreciate more of the depth of the script and brilliant portrayals by the cast.

The way Allen captures New York, it's inhabitants and their problems, is always entertaining to me, even if it hurts sometimes.
But we are all human after all, which makes Allen's films so special, he covers many a genre, including thrillers, so you never quite know, what to expect. No wonder, Kevin Spacey tried to get Woody Allen's attention to be cast in one of Allen's movies. ""Blue Jasmine"" is a save bet, although it can be sad here and there. Bittersweet is the word.

We see Jasmine's fantasy life unraveling--her masks, the things she hidden, the things she tries to ignore to live in her own bubble, etc.  It's funny and heart-breaking.

I like some of Allen's films a lot. But this was just wasn't good at all. Some say this was an attempt to portray Mia Farrow as being this 'crazy lady'. That's all hype-not true. Just his abuser's way of blaming other's (usually victims and their supporters) in order to deflect attention away from his sick actions.

I totally support his victim, Dylan Farrow. As a survivor I recognize her symptoms, the need to tell, and the all too common experience of being disbelieved, blamed and shamed.

5831791,1,B00DL47RQ2,"I do not mind flashbacks, but I do not enjoy having to watch them every eight minutes in a film. The movie became incongruent to me and jarring to my mind and visual stimulus. I thought Cate overacted most of the time. Actually, think the young woman who played her sister was better.

I cannot believe this movie has received such glowing reviews. As the title states, it was truly disappointing so far as I am concerned. My usual test of a good movie is whether I would enjoy watching it again, and actually it was all I could do to get through this one just ONE time. If I could, I'd ask for my money back! noel.manning@sbcglobal.net",1391040000,4,636,4.389830508474576
5831792,1,B00DL47RQ2,I cannot find anything good about this movie. It is not entertaining to watch a woman act so stupid about her relationship with her husband then turn around a lie to a man who really loved her. This movie show women in a very poor light.,1391040000,5,237,4.173913043478261
5831793,4,B00DL47RQ2,Acting by Cate was superb.  The story line was interesting with good characters.  Woody Allen is brilliant.  I would recommend it to those who like off beat independent films.,1391040000,,175,4.9655172413793105
5831794,2,B00DL47RQ2,"I don't get the good reviews.  The acting was great (and prevented me from turning it off) but the story was depressing and dull.

5831795,4,B00DL47RQ2,The film could be considered a dark comedy - beautifully acted by Blancett.  A movie that will coax you into feeling much better about your  personal life and surroundings.  Simplicity is best.,1391040000,,193,4.96875
5831796,1,B00DL47RQ2,"OK, I just could not wrap my mind around the storyline, which I guess is what really happened to Mrs. Bernie Madoff when all the dust settled and she had to 'flee' all her friends adn former lifestyle. I live in SF and just could not take the 'free-spirited sister in SF' angle, especially in regard to the inherent classism that is the crux of the story. And I personally found nothing redeeming in Jasmine character at all. She a nutcase, pure and simple. In her own little world. Oh, Woodie, to use an actress of Blanchett's peerless talent for a tale such as this...wow. A fall from grace, indeed...",1391040000,8,603,4.490909090909091

5831812,4,B00DL47RQ2,"The acting, particularly Kate Blanchart, was very good in Blue Jasmine.  It is a depressing movie.  The 4 stars were beause if I rated it 5, it would be a movie I would want to see again.  This is not a movie I ever want to see again.

Also, it was not in HD!  And Amazon has not refunded he difference yet.  This was our first experience streaming from Amazon.  It may be our last.  The picture quality was not what we are accustomed to seeing.",1391040000,,445,4.093023255813954
5831813,2,B00DL47RQ2,"How did Woody get such talent to star in this drivel? Blanchett does beautifully with this confused, misogynistic, mean-spirited and muddled script. But even she cannot save this movie.

From the trailers, I thought this was going to be a fish-out-of-water comedy with a twist. Instead it's a confused portrait of a narcissistic, nasty woman on a downward spiral. The characters are one-dimensional, unconvincing and unlikable. There's no theme uniting the disjointed storyline. Even the soundtrack is poorly done, with Woody introjecting his own saxophone playing incongrously.

I can't believe this film got good reviews, or that top talent agreed to be in it. When is Hollywood going to wake up and smell the garbage? This emperor's got no clothes.",1391040000,3,751,5.25
5831814,5,B00DL47RQ2,"Before I'm even posting this review of the newest Woody Allen film there are 272 other reviews here.  Many of these are of the film itself (going back to last summer. So, I won't spend your time rehashing the film but will concentrate on the DVD version and hopefully add some new info.

This is Allen's paean to Tennessee Williams ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" and Australian actress Cate Blanchett is the centerpiece. Alec Baldwin plays her ex-husband who is not unlike the Bernie Madoff-type character that Leo DiCaprio plays in ""Wolf of Wall Street"". Though two comedians (Andrew Dice Clay and Louis C.K.) have large supporting roles, Allen doesn't use their comedic ""talents"" (questionable IMHO for Clay) and, honestly there is not one ""funny"" movement in the 98 minute film. But Allen doesn't always do ""funny"" and that's fine with me.

There are two ""bonus features"" on the DVD (I watched the DVD, not the BD), both recorded at the film's ""press conference"". First we have a five-minute ""Notes from the Red Carpet"" showing comments from three of the actors (Blanchett, Clay and Peter Sarsgaard - the latter shows up late in the film) with clips from the film inserted.  Then we have the full 24-minute ""press conference"" with these three actors. We learn that, except for Blanchett, the actors were only given the script for sections that they appear in (an Allen standard practice), and so they couldn't react to the whole story.

AS he (almost) always has, Allen uses great 1920s music as his soundtrack. This time - in addition to jazz, we have some great female blues singers.

This is not my favorite Allen film (Will anything ever beat ""Annie Hall""?) but it was certainly worth watching.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5831829,5,B00DL47RQ2,"Cate Blanchett definitely deserves an Oscar for this role.  She was so in it that it seemed like she was in my living room with me.  I was not watching a performance, I was having a conversation with her and going places with her.  I did not get that feeling at all watching Amy Adams in American Hustle.  Ms Adams acted the role well, but it was all a con game.",1391040000,2,362,4.056338028169014

5831833,5,B00DL47RQ2,"Kate Blanchett is superb in this movie.  Woody Allen is masterful.  However, don't expect the typical Woody Allen timing...his usual chatter is limited to Kate Blanchett's head-noise.  It is far more dark and anxiety ridden than other Allen movies.  SInce, my internet was acting hinky the night we rented it, I ended up watching the last third about 5 times....and surprise surprise...I was happy to have done so.  It seemed to get better every time...mostly due to Blanchett's performance...which is unavoidably irritable at first, but after 5 times, I fell in love with her....even though no one else loved Jasmine in this movie...  you just cannot deny the formidable performance!",1390953600,,684,5.172727272727273

It is a well-written, well-made movie with a capable cast.  I will not view this movie again because I was uncomfortable with Blanchett's character and wanted her out of my life.

5831854,4,B00DL47RQ2,"Maybe not so much on the crying.  Jasmine has her funny moments, but also her sad ones.  Since this is a Woody Allen film, the characters are far too complex for easy emotional responses.  Laughs often come with a cringe and tears with some anger or pity or disgust.  Jasmine is trying to pull together her life so she can do something ""substantial,"" only Jasmine herself is not ""substantial.""
You can read plot details elsewhere.  The acting was great, cinematography great, music typical Allen selections.  Surprises from Andrew Dice Clay as a well-played aging and scarred man, and Sally Hawkins, whom I have not see much of but now I will.",1390953600,,643,4.747747747747748

5831859,5,B00DL47RQ2,Excellent performances by the women in this film with Cate Blanchett receiving a well deserved oscar nomination for best actress.  As is typical in many of Allen's films the movie shows a short period of of a person's life and then just has this person continue on afterwards almost as if nothing has happened.

5831864,4,B00DL47RQ2,"Typical Woody Allen movie rich in characters with colorful personalities and brilliant performances. Kate Blanchett nails it as the delusional ex socialite and special mention goes to Andrew Dice Clay who although has a small part, does a great job.",1390953600,,249,5.25
5831865,3,B00DL47RQ2,"The title was a bit misleading, but Cate Blanchett is great! I love her so much. She's beautiful even when she is nuts. This film breaks away from movies with explosions and robots, so I applaud the filmmaker for going a different route. I also applaud the filmmaker for not using that long drawn out bass sound when something bad happens. Extra kudos for resisting the temptation to cast Shia LaBeof. Rest assured there are no slow motion scenes to fill up time and make the audience think that that particular scene is more important than it is. I give it a loud ""Huzzah!"" and low deep ""Hmmmm"" sound.",1390953600,,602,4.532110091743119
5831866,5,B00DL47RQ2,Cate Banchett does a masterful job of acting out the self-obsessed wife of a philanderer with Woody Allen's great script.

5831867,1,B00DL47RQ2,"Woody allen has an unusual idea of how poor people live. He also seems to think everyone in the world speaks with a Brooklyn accent. All the characters are  just unlikeable.

This movie is a fantastic character study of Kate Blanchett's tortured ""Jasmine"" rapidly heading off the deep end.

Only in places like Amazon and some of the professional reviews will you find critiques that hit all the points. The script is unbelievably flawed for what was supposed to be a ""good film"". It's filmed blandly, edited horribly, and the soundtrack does not fit at all. A lot of the movie feels like they filmed half of it then later went back and did the rest, because of how poorly thought out it is. There was obviously some misunderstandings with the script when it came to the actors. Blanchett has three good scenes. The rest feels like she had no idea what Allen wanted. All the other characters are poorly done too, especially the sister's boyfriend; Chili, who is practically bipolar in writing, but not in delivery.
The sad part is that Blanchett will most likely win Best Actress. This movie is ridiculously overrated.",1390867200,4,976,4.713450292397661

Of course, he writes his own witty & wonderful dialogue, but the main plot and characters are EXACTLY the same as Streetcar Named Desire... It appears that most reviews on Amazon are by people who don't have a clue about this adaptation or have not seen the original, but it should be noted that Woody was so impressed by Cate's portray of Blanch on stage that he asked her to play the part in his own adaptation... It is a joy to watch Blue Jasmine, but then watch the classic Streetcar Named Desire with the legendary Vivian Leigh, or the 1999 T.V. remake of the same with the magnificent Jessica Lange as Blanch. Ultimately, it is Tennese Williams who created such profound and powerful characters within a story that is immortal, and a dynamic role for female lead stars who are phenomenon in showing depth of emotions...

She goes to live with her working class sister who dates men who make Joey Buttafucco look suave.  Great acting, but the story was a knockoff of Streetcar Named Desire.

5831966,3,B00DL47RQ2,"Some awkwardly humorous scenes, a lot of unsympathetic characters, and the wrap up at end (which reveals important detail) sort of ties up an ending to the story - not quite resolving everything - which is why write 'classic woody allen'. I enjoyed Midnight in Paris, more - because although the rich bored characters weren't anyone I could relate to, I did enjoy the journey and seeing how the story line would be resolved. I didn't enjoy this journey - it was kind of painful to watch pain, delusion, arrogance, rudeness, blah, blah, blah . . .good movie to watch while knitting, sewing, or polishing your nails, etc., not a ""date movie"". Cate B. does carry the movie (one of my favorite actresses). She gets an opportunity to show a wide range of emotion - the appeal of this movie  may be seeing 'Jasmine' as a snooty (arrogant) rich person, getting her comeuppance ( ""the bigger they are, the harder they fall"") as she reveals an emotionally bereft/unavailable delusional persona. (Rather than satisfying, it's sad for me because I take no delight in seeing someone falter or fail, regardless of how bad they behaved).",1390780800,3,1123,4.788659793814433

However, the way the story unfolds on two fronts is amazingly effective.  The acting led by Kate Blanchett is visceral.  Are we watching a movie, or living along side the characters.

5831972,2,B00DL47RQ2,"I watch a lot of movies, but in no way do I consider myself a film buff. I don't see a movie as art, but rather as the telling of a good story. And in ""Blue Jasmine,"" there is no story whatsoever. It is a purely existential film, which explains how the main character, Jasmine, ends up in the situation she is currently in. She ends the story in the same condition in which the story began, but how she got into that situation is revealed slowly over a course of flashbacks.

After watching this movie, I felt that I found myself not able to relate with the art in this movie, just as Jasmine's sister has difficulty relating to the lives and thoughts of Jasmine herself. I feel that this movie was created for a different type of movie goer. As the dichotomy between rich and poor social classes are clearly outlined in this movie, I believe that there is the same dichotomy in movie viewers. Us ""poor"" movie watchers that find us unimpressed with this movie take it at face value, that the point of this story was meaningless, there was no plot, and it incites feelings of hatred for the main character, Jasmine. However, those ""rich"" movie viewers with a taste for the not-so-obvious aspects of film will  enjoy the nonlinearity of the plot, the superb acting job by Blanchett, and the feelings of hate that the film incites for the main character.

Therefore, if you're a guy that likes to sit back, relax, and let a good story unfold--this movie is not for you. However, if you enjoy film for its ""finer aspects"" (which I don't), and wish to see masterful acting, a non-traditional plot, and develop some intense hatred for the main character along the way--then this is for you.

I also found this movie slightly unrealistic in the way that some people would react and behave (besides the main character, Jasmine, because she was obviously not mentally sound through most of the present day plotline).",1390694400,4,1907,4.583577712609971

5831979,5,B00DL47RQ2,"Maybe this movie should have been filmed in New Orleans, because there is a whole lotta blues going on here.  But then again, San Francisco was fine by me; I noticed a lot of sights that I've been to while living and visiting the ""City by the Bay"" for the past three years.

Everyone talks about Cate Blanchett's performance here, and yes, once again, she does give a great performance.  But would you expect anything less?  But in reality, one of the most inspired acting choices in history -- Andrew Dice Clay!  Whoda thunk it?  Well, Woody Allen! -- just rocks and rolls here as a transplanted-most-likely-ex-Jersey guy.  He may be an ex-comic, but his schtick still makes me laugh, and I was laughing the whole time that he appeared on screen.  I kept waiting for him to reach one hand around his head and put a cigarette in his mouth with that hand, but he never did it.  Most likely, he did while shooting, and Mr. Allen said, ""Ah, let's try that one again. . . ""

And in reality, this is probably Mr. Allen's funniest film in years.  While I like the film ""Annie Hall,"" my favorite has always probably been ""Sleeper.""  I've seen that film quite a few times, and I still always laugh.  As a matter of fact, I think that Mr. Allen was slightly ahead of his time with some of that story, as some of the plot elements -- cloning, robots, etc. -- are now almost old hat.  (Alright.  No one has built a truly decent robot yet.  But someone will, and soon.)

This film shows how fate can truly play a part in one's life.  People really don't realize how close they are between being famous and being a goat; how close they are between being rich and being poor; and what a small sliver there is between hanging out in a mansion in Sausalito with a drink in hand, or sitting on a park bench babbling to oneself in San Francisco.  We see that first hand here with Ms. Blanchett, and she always remains just barely more than a sympathetic character no matter what ""role"" she's playing at any given moment, or what person she's hurting, or has hurt, in her past.

I'll give a big recommendation on one of Mr. Allen's best films in years, maybe even best ever.  But next time, might I recommend shooting in New Orleans, Mr. Allen?  After all, I'm sure that there is plenty of Xanax and booze available on Bourbon Street.",1390694400,,2315,4.384976525821596

The great wealth despairity and how it is effecting the individual and the world in which we live.

5832002,2,B00DL47RQ2,"On the basis of characters like Annie in 'Annie Hall' (1977), Eve in 'Interiors' (1978), Cecelia in 'The Purple Rose of Cairo' (1985), Helen Sinclair in 'Bullets Over Broadway' (1994) and Maria Elena in 'Vicki Cristina Barcelona,' among others, Woody Allen has acquired an international reputation as a writer of great cinematic roles for women.

But while it is true that Allen has created many interesting, imaginative parts for actresses over the decades, it is also true that Allen has written at least as many bad roles for women as good.

Other roles, such Jill in 'Manhattan' (1979), Dorrie in 'Stardust Memories' (1980), Hannah in 'Hannah & Her Sisters' (1986) or Angela in 'Cassandra's Dream' (2007), are actually little more than sketches brought to three-dimensional life by Meryl Streep, Charlotte Rampling, Mia Farrow, and Hayley Atwell, the actresses who essayed the roles, and by Allen's considerable talent as a director.

Inexplicably overpraised by American critics, and despite its ninety-eight minute running time, 'Blue Jasmine' (2013) is a flat, boney melodrama that seems like less than half of a fully realized film, as if everything substantial and meaningful about it has been perversely excised.

Awkwardly combining aspects of the recent Bernie Madoff financial scandal with plot elements of Tennessee Williams' 'A Streetcar Named Desire' (1947), the previous Allen film it most resembles, especially in tone, is 'September' (1987), the sour, little-seen drama which represented Allen's first creative and commercial failure and also precipitated his long 1990s decline. Perhaps not coincidentally, 'September' also drew directly from life, clumsily reconfiguring as it did the Lana Turner-Johnny Stompanato-Cheryl Crane murder scandal of 1958.

Did Allen consciously fit the 'Blue Jasmine' screenplay with the basic outline of one of the 20th century's most famous and groundbreaking plays? It is worth remembering that in 1973's hit comedy 'Sleeper,' which Allen wrote with Marshall Brickman, Allen's character, Miles Monroe, after being brainwashed by fascistic government forces, briefly believes himself to be Blanche DuBois, allowing Allen to perform a hilarious parody of the character. Either way, the 'Streetcar' plot elements and structure are present in the current film: a traumatized, mentally unstable, and guilt-ridden woman in early middle age flees from a sordid past to her sister's economically and socially lower class home, where, instead of finding comfort, she is immediately confronted by brutal realities which threaten to strip away the last of her remaining illusions, and loses a new romantic interest in the process.

Most of the scenes are short and perfunctory, almost boilerplate, and completely lacking in depth or imagination. Several scenes threaten to take on a life of their own and become fluid, organic, and compelling, but unfortunately come to an abrupt halt. Some scenes, such as those in which Jasmine is wooed and then sexually accosted by her dentist employer, seem like intentional parodies. A mid-movie subplot involving an audio engineer is nothing but padding and misdirection. Lines of dialog and entire scenes have been lifted from previous Allen screenplays.

Though the film is a drama, it is undramatic, and plays as if Allen purposefully wanted the final result to be as flat, banal and minimalist as possible. There is none of the emotional power, catharsis or suspense found in earlier Allen dramas like the visionary 'Interiors,' 'Match Point' (2005), or 'Cassandra's Dream,' imperfect films all, but films which nonetheless predominantly work as good cinema.

Cate Blanchett, cast against type given the continuous awkward stumbling required of the character, provides an adequate performance in the shallow role of Jasmine, a character who has none of the emotional resonance or romanticism of Williams' Blanche DuBois. Since Jasmine is depicted as predominantly superficial, snobbish and materialistic before her fall from grace, there is no particular reason for the viewer to find meaning in her collapse, as Jasmine stumbles around San Francisco being deflated by one negative brush with reality after another.

Is Jasmine Francis a 'great role for women'? The script makes the major mistake of downplaying anything inherently good in or interesting about Jasmine, such as her early interest in anthropology, or her relationship with her stepson. Though Jasmine reacts volcanically when she learns her husband, Hal, is carrying on sexual and romantic relationships with other women, this is the only aspect of Jasmine's presumed love for Hal on view at any time. Does Jasmine genuinely love Hal or simply view him as another acquisition, as the promising result of her own shrewd social maneuvering?

The role explores no facet of Jasmine's psyche specifically, and Allen has examined mental illness, and mental illness in women, far better in 'Interiors,' 'Stardust Memories,' and 'Vicki Cristina Barcelona,' just as he has said more about human frailty and the need for comforting illusions via the character of Helena in the underappreciated 'You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger' (2010).

The secondary characters, including Hal (Alec Baldwin), Jasmine's sister, Ginger (Sally Hawkins), Stanley Kowalski stand-in Chili (Bobby Cannavale), Augie (Andrew Dice Clay) and Dwight (Peter Sarsgaard) are either thin stereotypes or present merely as plot devices, though Baldwin, and particularly Clay, make the most of their brief roles.

The film, apparently by intent, makes little use of its San Francisco locations, and the city's hazy sunlight also works completely against it, giving the preponderance of the California scenes an ugly ochre cast, one entirely different from the warm Mediterranean tones of 'Vicki Cristina Barcelona,' even though the same cinematographer, Javier Aguirresarobe, worked on both films

Allen, a great American artist, has been on an impressive artistic roll since 2005's 'Match Point,' and thus can easily be forgiven the overt creative failure of 'Blue Jasmine.' Allen's previous film, 'To Rome with Love' (2012), was also a creative failure, but one which at least enjoyed a few bright moments and offered audiences another example of Darius Khondji's gorgeous cinematography. 'Blue Jasmine,' however, is meandering, pointless, and baldly depressing in its inability to say or do anything insightful with its plot, subject, or theme.",1390521600,12,6458,5.497983870967742
5832003,5,B00DL47RQ2,"This is such a nuanced story of a fragile personality broken by too many knock out blows.  It focuses between the new harsh reality and the past that was so full of possibilities.  Life can be a great equalizer and many people have experienced hard times even through no fault of their own.  I found myself sadly identifying with the main character Jasmine even though I've never been a socialite or had great wealth.  But it's easy to keep looking back into the past and comparing the circumstances we find ourselves living in to how they were different in the past.  It's easier when things keep getting better but how do we handle it when things are tougher and our earning power has greatly diminished leaving us with fewer choices or what do we do when our marriages fail?  Woody Allen takes a life changed by shattered promises with details that leave us shell shocked and ashamed at how it all played out in the public forum.

As usual there is the great jazz movie soundtrack.  Cate Blanchett clearly here has been given an amazing role by Woody (one of his most memorable- and that's saying alot!)  I am so glad I bought this movie as I'll want to see it many times.  I now have two favorite Woody Allen movies... Hannah and Her Sisters and Blue Jasmine. This movie has a well chosen cast with Alec Baldwin, Andrew Dice Clay and Sally Hawkins as standouts.  Alec is great as the cheating husband and Sally as the sister who has a big heart and unfortunately has too ordinary a life for Jasmine to have paid her any attention until all her luck has run out!  You get the distinct impression that living with her sister is the absolute lowest point in her life and if she had any other option she would have not stooped so low! It is totally lost on Jasmine that she should actually be grateful for her sister's generosity and it is keeping her from being out on the street.  Ginger, the sister is a more contented person and not consumed by her possessions.

People have mentioned that her sister apartment is tacky but I think it's about as cozy as an average home of a working class person.  I think that Woody Allen has imparted keen awareness of how easily life can shatter when people build their lives on lies.  I, also, think that had Jasmine's husband not been so lavishly supporting Jasmine's needs of stoking her self centered life style she wouldn't have had the liberty of wearing blinders where it came to her husband's activities.  It also occurred to me that Woody Allen having gone through his scandal of the fall out over his affair with his step daughter a decade ago gave him keen insight into writing an insightful script about a shattered life from scandal, the aftermath and how it could break a person into little pieces.  I'm glad that Mr. Allen didn't let his life or talent break apart but used it as a catalyst for creativity.",1390435200,3,2861,4.500967117988394

I have to say, I didn't think about it much in the days following watching, which is an indicator for me how much a movie has moved me or how strongly I feel about it.

Jasmine is mankind, lost, over medicated and careening towards a sad end on a bench in San Francisco. Blanchett turns in her finest performance as the hopeless, mentally ill victim of her own hubris and greed. The stellar cast is effective though the prevalence of Jersey accents in San Francisco was a little odd. Despite that, the concept of this group of East Coast expatriates seeking a new life in the American west is a nice touch. Even if they do all end up back together as refugees working dead-end jobs and socializing mostly among themselves, much like most first wave emigres. This is an exhausting film to sit through, it requires focus and discipline on the part of the viewer to absorb the emotional energy radiating from Blanchett and the rest of the cast.

5832015,5,B00DL47RQ2,"`Anxiety, nightmares and a nervous breakdown, there's only so many traumas a person can withstand until they take to the streets and start screaming.'

Woody Allen runs hot and cold, at times depending on whether or not he pastes himself on the screen of one of his films and drags the story down with his idiosyncratic mannerisms. And then there are the treasures such as `Interiors' and this incredibly well written tale of 21st century class differences, family disparities, greed, and substance abuse as well as people abuse. The primary reason for seeing this film is the joy of watch Cate Blanchett's indelible performance of a woman wholly out of control without the support of money, a man, pills, and alcohol. She is astonishingly fine.

Jasmine French (Cate Blanchett) had been on the top of the success mountain as a New York socialite, until her marriage to philandering and criminally inclined Hal (Alec Baldwin) ended when in a snit of hostility she turns him into the FBI for his fraudulent career in money investment and ends up hanging himself wile in prison. Jasmine lost all of her valuables and money when Hal was discovered and now is penniless, jobless (and `above' taking a routine job) so she returns to her estranged sister Ginger (Sally Hawkins) in San Francisco utterly ruined. As Jasmine struggles with her haunting memories of a privileged past bearing dark realities she ignored, she tries to recover in her present: pills, alcohol, a receptionist job in a dentist's office (the dentist comes on to her), her `above all this squalor' treatment of Ginger, Ginger's boyfriend Chili (Bobby Cannavale) and children, and her missteps in lying to a wealthy suitor (Peter Sarsgaard) all turn out wrong. Jasmine's inability to function as a `normal' woman unprotected by the facade of `upper class nobility' result in her making her own existence untenable to her and to everyone she encounters.

Allen wisely tells his story in rapid flip-flops between Jasmine's past in New York and her present in San Francisco. The cast is homogeneously excellent, down to the smallest part. But in the end this is a triumph in acting for Cate Blanchett and she simply outdoes her past roles with a dazzling brilliance.  Grady Harp, January 14",1390435200,2,2252,4.9655172413793105

I lived on the upper east side for many years and dealt with these Park Ave princesses and trust me Woody Allen & Cate nailed it. Cate plays a Park Ave socialite whose cheating, robbing and sociopathic husband gets arrested for his corrupt ponzie scheme. Cate's character Jasmine is then left with nothing and ends up moving in with her adopted sister who bags groceries for a living. Jasmine is stuck in the past mentally and cant seem to come to terms with the degrading fall her life has taken. She's having a serious mental breakdown and no one seems to notice or understand the severity of it. I found the movie realistic and engrossing. I thought Cates performance was fantastic!!

Ok I knew this was no feel good movie but pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease ! There are too many manilpulating people out there to really enjoy watching Kate's character ..Who (spoiler) destroyed not only her life but her husbands. $15.00 at the theater to be depressed and then hear Oh how awesome Mr. Allen is to introduce us to yet another hysterical woman of riches to rags! Three stars is generous. That's only in tribute to Clay's performance. If you think you are being artsy fartsy giving this 5 stars ..Hah!,1390435200,,843,4.509803921568627
5832031,2,B00DL47RQ2,"I gave this movie two stars because of Cate Blanchette's acting, although I did catch her acting in a few scenes. I am a fan of Ms Blanchette's because I love to watch how she disappears into a character. That, to me, is real acting. As an avid movie fan, I love to be caught up in the storytelling and when I see an actor trying very hard in a scene to reach for the character he or she is playing, it takes me out of the story.
 In certain scenes I found myself saying ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" because i thought the scenes were somewhat derivitive. I won't say which scenes they are, let the other viewers make up their own minds
Overall, the two stars really reflect how I felt about the movie in general. I didn't care too much for any of the characters. Although I found myself fascinated by Ms Blanchette's outstanding acting abilities, I did not care for her character at all. I really thought she got what she deserved in the end.

5832032,4,B00DL47RQ2,"Jasmine (Cate Blanchett) is a socialite who has fallen on hard times. She moves to San Francisco to live with her blue collar sister (both were adopted and not blood related). Jasmine is in a constant state of drink, prescription drugs and nervous breakdown. She cannot function in her sister Ginger's (Sally Hawkins) world. Jasmine had the good genes and was mom's favorite, yet for me Ginger was the real hero as I never developed any empathy for our title character.

Allen works the juxtaposition to the max using flashbacks to compare Jasmine's current state to that of her past and also to the life of her sister Ginger. The flashbacks are not all chronological.

I am a fan of the Wood Man, I loved ""Midnight in Paris."" I kept waiting for the cleverness to hit me. Was it in the lyrics of the song ""Blue Moon"" which reflected Jasmine's life?

5832045,4,B00DL47RQ2,"Cate Blanchette deserves the Oscar for this fabulous performance as a woman who had everything and is now on the edge. Jeanette French, or as she is called now, Jasmine, arrives in San Francisco to live with her divorced sister and her two children. Jasmine has bent the ear of her seat mate, an elderly lady, on a plane from New York to San Francisco. Non stop talking, the elderly lady can't get away fast enough.

Jasmine has become penniless, even though she flew First Class and has expensive luggage and wears Chanel clothing. Her husband, a Bernie Maddoff take-off played by Alec Baldwin, has died and all their money is gone. Jasmine completely deconstructs,comes apart at the seams. Her medicine she calls Edison, electricity, which means ECT's for Bi-Polar. We have no idea if she is taking any medicine other than Xanax and Vodka, but we bet not.

Sister, Ginger, played by Sally Hawkins, is generous in spirit and tries her best to help Jasmine. Ginger bags groceries, takes care of her two boys, and loves her new boyfriend, played by Bobby Connavale. Each and every performance in this film is top notch, but, no one can compare to Care Blanchette. She takes this role and leaves everyone else in the dust. I was mesmerized by her performance, as is everyone who sees this film.

This film is true life, everyone around Jasmine is reaching out to her, but Jasmine has her sights set on something big, something to help her forget her philandering husband who embarrassed her so. Jasmine has no real skills to get back to, no profession to fall back on, just her sister who is part of the working class, from which Jasmine wants to escape.
A bravura performance that will sweep all the awards. Cate Blanchette makes Jasmine all too real, her world collapsing, and she has no way to stop it.

5832047,5,B00DL47RQ2,"2013 has undeniably been an incredible year for female leading performances. Its going to be very hard for the Oscar voters to pick just one. However, one performance from the summer that nobody has forgotten is gaining momentum with each passing award show leading up to the Oscars in early March.

I was lucky enough to see Blue Jasmine in the theater last summer, before all of the awards hoopla began. I suppose I simply never got around to writing a review on it. Thats my own fault. Rewatching Blue Jasmine on DVD this afternoon made me realize just what a gem this film was, and how realistic and true to life it is. We rarely see something this honest, this bracingly adult in American cinema. Thank goodness for Woody Allen.

Truthfully, I don't care for Woody Allen as a person, but its an undeniable fact that he makes incredible films. Hes gone off the rails and made a few subpar pictures, but even subpar Allen is still better than what you might see at the movie theater most of the time. Blue Jasmine represents a return to form for the director, who has been in the business for over sixty years. Its a fresh and fearless character study that proves he still has stories to tell.

Jasmine (Cate Blanchett) leaves her swanky Park Avenue life after her husband, a Bernie Madoff type (Alec Baldwin) is jailed for embezzling millions of dollars. Even though Jasmine is broke, she still manages to get a first class plane ticket to see her sister Ginger (Sally Hawkins), and her boyfriend (Bobby Cannavalle) who she isn't particularly fond of. Jasmine stays with her sister and her children, in their modest apartment, and struggles to find work and generally make sense out of what her life has become.

Jasmine certainly has varying mental illnesses, although its never clear to the viewer what is the root cause of Jasmines downfall. Shes constantly drinking and mixing prescription medication, but it appears her body is used to this. Her real mental illness doesnt have one root cause. It really is all sorts of things. Its mentioned that she had been through a psychiatric facility of some kind after a nervous breakdown, and its clear, with every passing moment, that she may be on the verge of another.

Her sister is happy in her humble little life, which really disgusts and enrages Jasmine. She is horrified that her sister has settled for a life so plain and devoid of everything that made her happy. The two are polar opposites, but our leading lady never quite understands that.

The plot is essentially an update on A Streetcar Named Desire. Jasmine is reminiscent of the 1950s housewife whose husband has abandoned her, and has nary a skill to fall back on. Always walking around in gorgeous Chanel jackets and drinking her Stoli martinis (with a twist of lemon) its obvious she is desperate to reclaim the lavish lifestyle that she once had. Ginger has always relied on men to bring her happiness, and in a way, so has Jasmine. Both ladies need to learn to live with what they have become individually, because its hard to rely on a relationship or a marriage to keep a person happy.

Her life has been simply swept out from under her. Through flashbacks, we understand Jasmines story more deeply. At the core, this film is about what a person does after their life has fallen apart. Allen has written such a rich character in Jasmine, and no actress other than Blanchett could have played her. The character doesnt require an actress of great range (shes crazy at the start and crazy at the end), but does require an actress who understands how precise and layered this character is.

""Blue Jasmine"" is not a comedy, and it doesnt leave the viewer feeling all warm and fuzzy at the end. It certainly has its moments of comedic brilliance, but its definitely a drama, more than anything. Jasmine is not a happy person, and her story isn't necessarily a pleasant one. But its certainly a ride worth taking.

If there was an award for fascinating screenplay, this film must get the nod because it is amusing how quickly it becomes a part of your living room. I have seen Cate Blanchett in a number of performances but none more succinct and apt than this one right here. She plays the kind of person who always feels that the world has CHEATED her out of her best years. She is so sad, it  is really funny to see her being clumsy. There are scenes where her character Jasmine (of course) is constantly being tortured about what she is going to learn at medical school. She enjoys attention but hates attention. She plays the role of the aggrieved party to perfection. JUST WHY IS BLUE JASMINE SUCH A FUNNY FILM? Because Woody Allen knows us humans so well and when I see characters on scene do things I would do in real life but never admit to myself, I find it thoroughly entertaining and intriguing.

+ Strong plot (Such a strong plot related with effortless charms makes Blue Jasmine very REWATCHABLE)
+ Great use of celebrities and Stand ups (The casting was amazing. I didn't know Andrew Dice Clay could help himself but Woody Allen uses this annoying Celebrity to near perfection)
+ Locales/Situations/Terrific Editing
+ Humor - Blue Jasmine is blessed with timing and the delightful gift of playing on peoples sentiments, both happy and sad.
Overall, this film is as good as they get. My favourite Woody Allen film in years. I enjoyed this more than Midnight in Paris which I really liked a lot.",1390176000,5,1768,4.5886075949367084
5832058,2,B00DL47RQ2,"This is perhaps Woody Allen's darkest film, but that does not explain my disappointment. For starters, Woody Allen's bouncy 1930's and 40's jazz track that seems to accompany the majority of his films is so jarringly misplaced in this movie that it becomes a distraction. That was the first thing that bothered me. The second glaring mistake was his choice of location: It's San Francisco but every single character featured is decidedly New York - from accents and mannerisms to turns of phrase and expressions. These two things may seem insignificant but they weren't to me - it created a dissonance that could have been appreciated had it been clearly deliberate. I don't believe it was. Perhaps Woody Allen is too close to his work and is repeating himself; he should call in outside (younger) opinion and thereby avoid such oversights.

To say that Blanchett's performance is good is an understatement; you cannot take your eyes off of her. But that isn't enough to save this film. Every single supporting character is loathsome to one extent or another. Even Peter Saarsgard's character - a supposedly decent guy - seems creepy and suspicious, although that was clearly not Allen's intention. Sally Hawkin's relentlessly ditzy shaky-voiced persona became nearly unwatchable; her boyfriend is a cartoon-like buffoon - a complete stereotype that we've seen so often that it's boring. Louis CK's presence in the film is bewildering. It made absolutely no sense whatsoever; his entire role should have been deleted on the cutting room floor.  I could go on and on. One-dimensional characters who experience no growth, who remain stagnant throughout the whole movie, are just not interesting.

Woody Allen is an old man and it's truly commendable that he's still writing, producing, and directing his own films. But placing a movie in modern times with a scratchy jazz soundtrack shows that he's behind the times. Writing a female character who has absolutely no understanding of computers is behind the times. Even the most useless of rich socialites uses a computer if only to shop on-line. That such a woman could obtain employment in a dental office without any computer skills is absurd; every medical office is automated and computerized. His female characters are a throw-back to another era; they just don't ring true at all. Sally Hawkin's character has two kids we rarely see; we meet her ex-husband in flashbacks but he has no presence in the lives of his kids - it's only when he bumps into Jasmine on the street that we remember him at all. This was odd to me; when the kids are absent are we to assume they're with their father? Who knows.

All in all, very disappointed by a film that I was very anxious to see.",1390089600,13,2727,4.908893709327549

5832063,1,B00DL47RQ2,"In too many ways to explain here, this movie is a sad tribute to Woody Allen's demise as a great director. It totally misses the mark. I had been looking so forward to seeing it, but found it utterly devoid of verisimilitude, and almost laughable, if not painful to watch. It completely lacks the humored good nature that is Woody's signature voice and style, and shows how totally out of touch Woody is with contemporary American culture and the economic realities of Americans in the 21st century. The characters are tired, overblown caricatures from his standard New York playbook, transported to the misconceived purgatory of the San Francisco in his mind. Jasmine's sister Ginger and her new boyfriend Chili speak the language and have the mannerisms of Queens or the Bronx, and couldn't be more unlike Bay Area natives. More like Rocky and Adrian, of mid-seventies Rocky fame.  The ""hole"" that is Ginger's  apartment, as it is referred to, is a clear reflection of Woody's distorted perception of economics. It is far too large, clean and nicely decorated. Ginger, as a single mother of two working as a grocery clerk in SF could NEVER AFFORD such an apartment, and her two young sons are very poorly cast, and have no real place in her life or the movie. The movie feels like it is set in the seventies or early eighties, as there is virtually no evidence of the contemporary tech boom. Guests at a party of wealthy elites in Belvedere, Marin,  dance ballroom style to breezy jazz when they should be laconically chatting to a much more contemporary soundtrack. Cate Blanchette navigates the frightening psychological topography of Jasmine with shuddering clarity, and the story itself is compelling, but in the end, the movie falls totally flat under the weight of the director's heavy handed and clumsy treatment of the characters, its confused mood and poorly drawn setting.",1390003200,58,1884,4.918238993710692

It is as new and fresh as any of his classics were in their time. Seamlessly through past and present the main character destroys her life and then destroys every chance she's given at redemption
as she mentally unwinds. She turns up her nose at a dentist and then lies to her dream man. Who doesn't love a highly strung pill popping socialite?  Blanchett played Stella Dubois onstage in Sydney and this brilliant comic reconstruction of her makes me wish I had seen it. Woody Allen brings together a wide ranging world class cast as he often does and gives them poetry to speak wether they are educated or lack any sort of sophistication. Another favorite was a parallel to streetcar and that was cannavale, who is always good.

5832069,4,B00DL47RQ2,"I start this off with saying I never watched a Woody Allen film nor did I know what Streetcar was about before watching this movie. I watched this because of the buzz after the Golden Globes. I was pleasantly surprised because I usually watch action movies and more TV shows than movies. I always pick a couple of films from the awards ceremonies that I watch to see if the quality of movies has gone up. Most of the time the quality is the same or degraded, but I liked this movie and recommend it.

I don't want to spoil anything for eventual viewers, but the story revolves around a woman who had a rich and lavish lifestyle and it goes all down the drain when her husband is arrested and the fortunes go away (think Bernie Madoff type). After her riches and extravagant lifestyle are gone, she moves across country, from New York to San Francisco, to live with her middle class sister and her two sons. It's a far cry from what she is used to; going from a penthouse on Park to a small, cramped house with little room to breathe.

She eventually tries to mingle with people (who she sees as her inferior), gets a job (once again, beneath her) and tries to get back on her feet in the dating scene. The entire problem this character has, and Cate Blanchett plays it extremely well, is that she is too tied up in her old lifestyle and cannot fathom living any other way. I don't want to get into the plot too much, for spoiler purposes, but things don't change.

This is a good film, especially if you've never seen a Woody Allen film, like myself. Will I explore more of his films? Probably not, but it's a good modern take about greed, the inability to discern fantasy and reality, and the crudeness that comes with avarice.

I would recommend this film. It has a good, not great, cast of actors, but they do an exceptional job. I mean who would think Andrew Dice Clay could be good without using 50 swear words in a minute. The surprise performance for me is by Bobby Cannavale who plays Chili, the sister's boyfriend. I thought it was another greaser role but he did a really good job.

Anyway, that's my review. Take it with a grain of salt considering the only reason I watched is because of the buzz. I'm not afraid to admit that, but don't destroy me because of it. Have a great day.",1389744000,4,2293,4.348130841121495

The long, repetitive, sad monologues by Cate Blanchett were tedious and painful to watch and not because they evoked any emotion worth feeling in this film. Alec's role was like a cameo afterthought and the only thing funny about the film was the short story line about her finance that was like watching the Marin County version of Niles and Maris Crane - 40 lbs heavier of course. That was it. I was so glad I watched this on Roku so that I could speed through the stupid frames at high speed which was unfortunately most of the film.

Blanchett embodies this lost woman so toatlly it makes one want to walk into the screen and help her,listen to her...like the Purple Rose of Cairo (a Woody Allen filmwhere fan Mia Farrow walks into the film...repeatedly)

It is a homage to A Streecar Named Desire, and it is done with subtety and a pathos that Allen is expert at, so that we are taken further into this woman's damaged spirit almost at once..npt more so than Blanche Dubis, but in a new ligjt, woith new angles and new visons for the camera to see. and for us to imbibe in.

Allen captures the hectic pace of America, the nonsensical things done to survive, the lust for money in order to buy chic clothes and au current breads, teas, and Starbuck coffees.  Jasmine loses her money and she helplessly descends into hell.

This film reminded me of Allen's brilliant Interiors, often overlooked, especially the character Geraldine Page plays with such magnificence..lost in her beiges and blacks and her earth tone colors for interiors of holuses and apartments. Even her attempted suicide is ""decorated"" and her final dsecent into the gray ocean somehow has her imperious hand in the arrangement of things.

Jasmine is less neurotic, funnier, frank, but lost without the luxuries thatg sustained her..she has a low spirit , not very high vibfrations to pull her through. She needs mobility, frantic changes, as does Page in the above mentioned film.
As with Page Jasmine has a sick spirit within her, a clouding of her potentials done to her by obsessive compulsive needing and getting and then losing everything. Her sanity had depended on poses, attitudes, ruses, masques, and now they are lifted and what is seen is a desperate character in need of almost everything.

I love Jasmine as a person..she carries the cross for us all, like Blanche Dubois, she reveals the reasons why there is ultimately only a grand silence out there for all of us who feel and think and trust.

As always with Mr. Allen, art saves us; it is the only life preserver that can  keep us dignified until final, unsullied dissolution.",1389571200,3,2188,4.7824933687002655

5832094,5,B00DL47RQ2,"sometimes Woody Allen bases his screenplays on works already in existence.  at other times, he writes a screenplay wholly his own.  this screenplay is like an extended jazz riff of one of the best American stage plays and then films which ever existed, A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE. in that play Blanche, whose life is in tatters, moves in with her sister because she has lost everything. her sister is married to a brutish but sensual man, Stanley Kowalsky (as immortalized by marlon Brando). blanche's mental state is precarious at best and she makes the mistake of attacking Stanley, belittling him to her sister.  it is set shortly after WW II in New Orleans. this is the 2013 update to that play.

one major difference is that Jasmine married for money to a rich crook, Bernie Madoff style (Alec Baldwin).  riches alone are not what motivated Blanche but they certainly would help achieve what she wanted.  she was a southern hothouse flower who lived for the refinement of being a Belle of the South. Blanche started out refined in a grand old estate.  but she and it fell on hard times. Jasmine and her sister were both adopted children with Jasmine being mistaken as the ""good"" child because of her blonde good looks and perfect grades. jasmine is not a sympathetic character at all whereas Blanche was sympathetic at times. one major thing the two versions have in common is that the female leads do the acting jobs of a lifetime.  in the STREETCAR film it was Vivien Leigh as Blanche, who won her second Oscar for it (first was GONE WITH THE WIND). if Cate Blanchett does not win for her tour de force performance as Jasmine, the academy should go out of the film business. Woody Allen continues to write roles for women which are incredible. this reminds me of the Geraldine page performance in his INTERIORS or the Gena Rowland's performance in ANOTHER WOMAN.

outstanding work is also done by the supporting cast. Alec Baldwin is perfect in the ""Bernie"" role as is Bobby Canavale in the Brando role (which is a much lesser role in this film). Louis C.K., the stand up comic, shows he can really act, as does another standup comic, Andrew Dice Clay, both involved with the sister. the sister is very like the sister in STREETCAR and the actress plays her perfectly.  Finally, one of my favorite actors, Peter Sarsgard does an excellent job as the man jasmine is trying to seduce into marriage to solve all of her problems. this was the role played by Karl Malden in STREETCAR. blanche dated him as a possible way out from her problems.

the immortal line used in Streetcar, by Blanche, ""I have always depended on the kindness of strangers,"" is not used in this film but you will hear it nonetheless... loud and clear... that is all Jasmine has left, just like Blanche did.

5832096,5,B00DL47RQ2,"""Blue Jasmine"" is flawless -  a perfectly acted film that is written and directed with a master's touch.  While I love Woody Allen's films, I also have a ""love/hate"" relationship with them, particularly his portrayal of women over the past two decades.  This film, however, is a great story, with dynamite acting across a number of talented performers.  Cate Blanchett is absolutely mesmerizing in the lead role, and Andrew Dice Clay deserves special mention for his beautifully nuanced performance. Here is an article I wrote about ""Jasmine"", and looked at some of Allen's film that don't portray women kindly:

[...]",1389139200,2,618,5.14
5832097,5,B00DL47RQ2,"A well-established matriarch in her circle, a strong creative woman past ninety with a mind of fine steel, vitality and fun, wrote this early morning from far way: 'Are you surviving New York in Siberia! Look to the skies for snowflakes with bright eyes, it may bring warmer weather your way. Write soonest as I am concerned'. To which I replied: 'You are a gem to write this early morning here, and I am up and about doing the laundry, musing about the story of a rich American woman who loses everything in this Great Recession, and her husband, a powerful corrupt banker on Wall Street, who ends up in jail. It certainly is realistic and timely. Not all of these women are prepared for these sudden life changes, and not all of them survive in such circumstances'.

Having enjoyed tremendously Mr. Woody Allen's last brilliant feat where he takes the viewers into the world of surrealism on a visit to Rome, I was looking forward to seeing his ""Blue Jasmine"", which brings us back to a harsh look at some realities today in the U.S., more precisely the impact that the Recession has brought on some of the women among us.

We are perhaps more attune to listening to the stories of the poorest among us with more empathy than the one of Jasmine's on Wall Street, and yet it made this viewer wonder about women who live in high society, and who overnight so to speak, and as one viewer aptly said, find that their crystal carriage has turned into a large pumpkin before midnight. Having witnessed as a child in another era, two beautiful and privileged American women, close courageous friends take the plunge, one fatally, and the other who endured and went on to great heights, the fate of Jasmine was of particular interest to this viewer, and served once again as a reminder of the importance of staying alert and awake, regardless of the choices you make in life. It is fine if women wish to marry for both love, money and fame, but their rich husbands may be heartless misers for instance, and their wives might have been better off with an honest tax accountant who adores them, and offers them a sable coat, or a sapphire necklace from a Madison Avenue boutique for their birthday. But some of these women also want to make an entrance into a world where sparkling pedigree counts among the elite, and this requires hard work on their part. Have I ever met and enjoyed the friendship of a Jasmine? I have, but her story is a pink one after some hard knocks along the way, and this was a long time ago.

On viewing Jasmine's sudden decline into dismal poverty where she is thrown into the cold street and takes flight where she can hide, in the way of a wounded animal, and attempts a geographical escape as well, she is so frightened that for a woman whose sense of direction has always been somewhat centered on the edge of reality, she ends up finding herself in what she considers 'Hell', precipitating her even faster into both a mental and physical decline. And, for some of the viewers who watch her descent into such a dark pitfall, they may soon realize that Jasmine, in shock and severely traumatized, is no longer able to make a decision, or function in any way. There are some people around who want to help her, at least in the beginning by telling her in one way, or another to stand up and start again by getting a new pair of 'shades', or simply a new life, which she is not able to manage although she gives it a shaky attempt. She is completely isolated in a bubble and has lost all, including love in every way and its many comforts. The vast divide between the two realities of her world is too powerful for her to take in. She has no safety-net to speak of, and is so vulnerable that the only fictitious woman I could think of, to match hers in degradation, is that of Sasha Jensen's, the creation of the late Jean Rhys, where one is also left wondering as to what it might be to feel the loss of the very essence of one's being.

Is there hope for Jasmine at the end, as we see her sitting alone on a park bench? It might in fact take a kindly stranger with some help, to bring her gently back to her feet and serves as a reminder that there are some good people who walk among us. For this viewer, ""Blue Jasmine"" is yet another outstanding masterpiece from Mr. Woody Allen, with the help of Ms. Cate Blanchett, one of the most brilliant actresses in our times today, amidst a few others. Congratulations to both of them. Together they make a fine working team, and the story of ""Blue Jasmine"" will remain memorable for this viewer with highest appreciation.

5832099,5,B00DL47RQ2,"Woody Allen's latest film is one of his best. It is entirely unfunny. It even lacks his Schadenfreude, which has sometimes spoiled his films for me. It combines elements of classic Tennessee Williams melodrama with recent financial news. As in the original Streetcar, the story begins with the arrival of the heroine at her sister's place. The heroine here is Jasmine, not Blanche. But we get Blanchett, as compensation. Can that be a coincidence?

Cate Blanchett's Jasmine was the wife of a late big time financial crook in New York. We learn her story in flashbacks. When her husband (Alec Baldwin) shipwrecks, she is lost in a maelstrom of shame, ruin, and confusion. She crosses the continent to stay with her red neck sister in San Francisco. She can't adjust her pretensions and illusions to the new realities. She talks, often to herself, often to mere strangers. She invents a new past for herself, in bits and pieces, never coherent.

He confirms in Blue Jasmine his great vein for narration, and the unique skill of being able to merge comedy and drama like no other, and perhaps better than ever before. In fact this movie is a continuous push and pull of emotions, where every moment is masterly planned and balanced.
Blue Jasmine is an elegant modern day tale about a Park Avenue woman who is unable to cope with reality. Whether in the pretentious and comfortable life of New York's high society alongside her rich husband and friends, whether in a simple life in San Francisco trying to start over, Jasmine seems to be addicted to denial and evades every bit of truth about her life, absolutely unable to take up any responsibility.
The cast is high profile and just perfect. They all deliver a superior performance, and Cate Blanchett is simply phenomenal.

5832102,4,B00DL47RQ2,"Woody Allen has been a constant force in films since he started making them, for nearly six decades.  While he fluctuates tones and has created masterpieces in both comedy and drama (and some a pure fusion of both), his style is never misrepresented and both genres feel very Woody Allen when all is said and done.  In other words; you know a Woody Allen film when you see one.  This is far from a bad thing, especially since Woody uses enough diversity in his tones, themes and subjects to create unique visions all their own.  Sure, hes had his repetitious moments, but overall he has more good than bad (the bad is sure to come when you make as many movies as Allen has) and has created a consistent career that is not only respected but beloved.

During the aughts, it was thought that Woody was reaching this point in his career where nothing was working as strongly or as fluidly as before.  He was being criticized more than praised and his films just were not making the impact they did in the previous decades.

He was hitting a slump.

Then he put out Match Point and the world cried Woody Allen comeback and he was back in the spotlight.  Scoop was a critical hiccup, but Vicky Cristina Barcelona gave him more love, but it was 2011s Midnight in Paris that suddenly made Woody Allen relevant again.  I, personally, didn't think the movie was that wonderful (I do consider Vicky Cristina Barcelona to be a modern masterpiece), but the world did not agree with me and Woody Allen once again found himself an Oscar winner.

With this years Blue Jasmine he has done it again.

Is it just me, or does Woody Allen seem to be on a good film/bad film kind of role here?  Just a point of interest, or discussion, but this seems to be a pattern.

Anyways, lets talk about Blue Jasmine.

Now, Blue Jasmine is not perfect, and it is far from Allens best work (it doesnt hold a candle to Vicky Cristina Barcelona or his 80s work for that matter) but it holds a certain sense of importance and sheer engagement over the audience.  Most of this is due to Cate Blanchetts tour-de-force performance as the emotionally and mentally unstable Jasmine, but Woodys biting wit and way with dialog certainly does its fair share of spellbinding.

The story is told in fragments as the action shifts from present to past and back again.  We see Jasmines marriage and wealth unfold and crumble and then see her current state of wellness take a turn for the better, seemingly, as she tries to rebuild her life with her adopted sister Ginger.

On the one hand, we have the story of Jasmines marriage to wealthy businessman and philandering crook Hal.  Jasmine is selfish, snooty and smothered in jewelry, furs and designer bags.  Her husband sleeps with everything that moves, and does so under the ignorance (possibly intentional) of his doting wife.  Behind the scenes, Hal is stealing money, and while others suspect it, Jasmine decides to ignore it.

We shoot forward to after Hals arrest, suicide and Jasmines destitution.  She has no money and is forced to move in with her sister Ginger, who lives in San Francisco.  The two have not been close for years, mainly due to Jasmines arrogance and refusal to embrace her sister and her seeming low standards.  Jasmine hated her first husband, resented her lack of means and finds her sense of humor embarrassing.  Now though, she needs to lean on someone.  She moves in, which upsets Gingers boyfriend Chili (who was planning on moving in with her) and so he is quick to try and get Jasmine to move on with her life.  The problem is, the stress has caused Jasmine to suffer a nervous breakdown and so her material loss is not her only obstacle.

She is going crazy.

There are no easy answers in Blue Jasmine.  The finale doesnt feel like a conclusion but more like a cliffhanger as we are left to wonder exactly where Jasmine is going to end up.  Will she ever pull herself together?  Will she ever find happiness?  Is she destined to become a crazy park bench cat lady who talks to herself and is made fun of by passersby?  While the film offer no easy answers, it does offer up a lot of easy (or maybe I should say lazy) observations.  I have two criticisms of this film (just two) and this is the first one.  All those claiming that Fruitvale Station was too obvious really should watch this film and see what obvious is all about.  The browbeating of the grass is not always greener on the other side and money is the root of all evil is VERY dominant here and it bleeds into every subplot.  Making this all the more obvious is the stereotypical treatment of every man in the film (my second criticism).  By giving no depth to Hal, Chili, Al, Dr. Flicker or Dwight (Augie is an exception), Woody Allen failed to completely flesh out his themes in a way that felt more than one-sided.  Ive had this issue with Allen before (my major complaint with Husbands and Wives was that it felt completely one-sided and lacked shared responsibility).

Still, these complaints do not take away entirely from the film.  They merely knock it down from a superb film to a merely great one.

Blanchett weaves through Allens dialog with so much ease, and she filters her emotional fluctuations with a brilliant sense of raw honesty.  This is clearly one of her finest moments and it may be one of Allens greatest character creations as well.  The fragility and hardness meld together into this explosive presence that one will not soon forget.  Her monologues, her mental frailties, her hysterical breakdowns; all of them could have veered into camp and yet her handling of every moment feels so grounded in Woodys themes and tones that she feels honest and relatable.  You can believe her.  Sally Hawkins is also stupendous here.  She is the perfect counterbalance to Blanchett.  She makes Ginger feel earnest and genuine in her concern and her growing insecurities and doubts.  As Jasmine unloads judgment on her, she begins to question her life choices and you bite into every question in her eyes.

My only wish is that the sea of tremendous male talent was used to better effect.  Alec Baldwin, Michael Stuhlbarg and Bobby Cannavale are mere caricatures.  While it is nice to see Peter Sarsgaard step away from playing a sleazy jerk, he is given like three scenes and hes swallowed by Blanchett in every one.  Louis C.K. could have developed something special, but his screen time is also very limited.  Andrew Dice Clay is the only man here to rise above and give us something that feels three dimensional.  While his scenes are few, you can feel the earthy rawness of this man who is gruff on the outside yet extremely human underneath.

At the end of the day, I really enjoyed this despite my reservations.  I wish that it hadnt been so obvious in its message and yet, the good here outweighs the bad in my eyes.",1386028800,5,6841,4.5902720527617475
5832103,4,B00DL47RQ2,"Whatever the strengths and weaknesses of Allen's yearly offerings, you have to admire a man that
is in his 70s, has made 44 movies, and yet seems to keep trying to stretch his wings, and style,
while still retaining a very recognizable film-making technique. Allen's films are always clearly
his, yet the tone, feel and structure of the films almost always has something a little new. In
this case, Allen is going for straight drama, (yes there are a few amusing moments, but in general
this is pretty serious stuff) something he hasn't done since ""Match Point"". But ""Match Point"" also
had the structure of being a mystery/thriller, whereas ""Blue Jasmine"" is a character study, pure
and simple. And in that it's not quite like anything Allen has done in his many, many films. The
earlier dramas like ""Interiors"" or ""Another Woman"" were both more stylized and weren't really
about dissecting a single fatally flawed character as if under a microscope.

This grew on me on a second viewing. Some of my problems remained; a lot of the supporting characters
are stereotypes, in spite of being played by wonderful actors, doing all they can to bring them life. But
the great Cate Blanchett, who seems incapable of being less than amazing, somehow manages to bring
reality, humanity and sometimes even pathos to this self-involved borderline crazy and theatrical mess
of a human being.

Whatever the quibbles, this is intelligent, grown up film-making, trying to grapple with big questions of
morality and personal responsibility, and unafraid of being a study of a largely unlikable woman. Allen is
still among the braver and least compromised of U.S.  directors, and continues to be worth watching
and supporting.",1385683200,5,1709,5.01056338028169
5832104,5,B00DL47RQ2,"One can take and savor the brilliant, angry ""Blue Jasmine"" at different levels.

As you will read many places, it's a brilliantly acted character study of Jasmine French (Cate Blanchett), one of two adopted sisters who left college before completing her anthropology degree to marry Hal Francis (Alec Baldwin), a man clearly destined for big things. As Hal's wife, Jasmine enjoys luxury homes in Manhattan and Southampton, extravagant jewelry, designer clothes, lovely vacations and the prestige that comes with being a leading hostess and fundraiser for various New York charities. She plays the part to perfection with her cultured voice and manners and subtle but exquisite taste while turning a willfully blind eye to anything that might be unsavory about Hal, whether it's his business practices or his philandering. When Hal goes to prison after it turns out his wealth is built entirely on scams, Jasmine loses everything, even her son Danny whose bitterness at his father's downfall drives him to drop out of Harvard and disappear. Carrying a Louis Vuitton suitcase and the clothes on her back, Jasmine flies to San Francisco to join her sister Ginger (Sally Hawkins) and try to build a new life for herself. Ginger lacks Jasmine's ethereal looks and chameleon-like adaptability and has settled for a life Jasmine looks down on, working as a clerk in a Mission District grocery store, bringing up two boys from her first marriage (which failed after Ginger and her first husband lost all their money in one of Hal's scams) and dating the volatile but passionate auto mechanic Chili (Bobby Cannavale). The narrative shifts in time from Jasmine's haphazard present-day efforts to start over in San Francisco and the upheaval she causes in Ginger's life to flashbacks of her life with Hal and the events that lead to his downfall, but never confuses the viewer. Jasmine, who has no practical skills other than being a rich man's wife--the woman cannot even operate a computer--tries to maintain a tether to sanity, sort of, while chasing Xanax with vodka. But having been cast completely adrift from the only adult world she has ever known, she is truly lost at sea.

There is humor to be found in ""Blue Jasmine,"" but it's bitter humor. I suspect that's because Jasmine is at another level a metaphor for what's going on in the United States. As Jasmine and Hal cavalierly push Ginger and her first husband Augie (Andrew Dice Clay in a surprisingly adept turn) out of the way when they visit New York  and then cost them their shot into the middle class, wealthy capitalists whose fortunes are built not on manufacturing goods or providing services but moving money around and sending jobs offshore are breaching their part of the social contract. The middle class continues to shrink, and the gap between extreme wealth and barely surviving grows ever wider. The wealthy may throw money at ""the losers"" in the form of charity or grants to charter schools, but damned if they'll pay their share of taxes or concern themselves with decent wages. And, putting aside the question of whether Jasmine deserves her fate, in showing Jasmine's efforts to work and go to school to ""make something of herself"" after the complete wreck of her world, the movie shows those whose purchase is steadily weakening or those who never had a purchase in the first place blaming themselves for failing in a system that is stacked against them. I don't think it was a scenic accident that much of the movie is set in San Francisco, a city where high-tech wealth is notoriously pushing middle class and working families out of the way.

It hurts to watch ""Blue Jasmine."" I think that's the idea.",1381795200,29,3678,4.908360128617363

5832106,5,B00DL47RQ2,"I bought a ticket to this movie knowing absolutely nothing about it, and almost immediately as it began I knew I was watching a Woody Allen movie.

I cannot say exactly why this is so.  Perhaps it was the richness of the character study, and the fact that Allen writes so excellently for female characters.  In any event, Cate Blanchett's character, and her brilliant performance of this down on her luck former socialite married to a conman husband played by Alec Baldwin, may be the best female character performance you will see on a movie screen this year, and Blanchett's performance is probably the most Oscar worthy I have seen so far.

Set in San Francisco in the present day it unfolds the complex relationship of two sisters, one upper class but fallen on hard times, and her working class sister who makes working class choices.  Because it unfolds in a non linear fashion it appears to dip randomly into different events over a period of about 15 years or so, and we understand why the sister is working class.

One of the themes of the movie is honesty, and facing reality, and Jasmine makes choices that seem oblivious to it. She fibs and tells little lies, at one level self deceptive, and at another deceptive of others.  We may not like her for this, but if you're like me, I felt tremendous compassion for her, even loved her in spite of everything, which is not often I feel that way about a character.  She suffers from severe anxiety, and the events she has to undergo take a toll on her.  One particular choice she makes has particularly severe repercussions, yet in the moment we fully understand it.

I think it is fair to say moving to Europe and making films there has been wonderful for Woody Allen.  In an interview he said that his previous movies were critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful. Now he has made a series of outstanding movies, and written brilliant roles particularly for women.

I cannot claim to love all of them, but&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vicky-Cristina-Barcelona/dp/B001SKB1Y0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vicky Cristina Barcelona</a>&nbsp;was excellent and Penelope Cruz won an Oscar for her performance.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Match-Point/dp/B000EQHXNW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Match Point</a>&nbsp;is probably my personal favorite starring Scarlet Johansson and Jonathan Rhys Meyers, about an upwardly mobile ambitious tennis coach, and what may be a perfect murder.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midnight-in-Paris/dp/B006AN78XS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midnight in Paris</a>&nbsp;was dreamy and sentimental, and won an Oscar for best screenplay.

Actors who worked with him have also won Oscars.  Remember Mira Sorvino for Mighty Aphrodite, and Michael Caine for Hannah and Sisters.

As someone who lives in San Francisco, I can say that he makes it look almost better than the reality, and a beige BMW can do wonders to enliven the surroundings.

It seems to me that like a good wine, Woody just gets better with age, and easily maintains his excellence with this movie.

I think  most people will enjoy this movie, and I hope this was helpful.",1380931200,161,3439,5.49146110056926

Alec's multi-million, fraudulent empire, based upon a Ponzi scheme, collapses and he is sent to prison, in an eventuality thought by many to echo the story of Mr. and Mrs. Bernie Madoff.  Jasmine is left with nothing but some designer duds and luggage.  Yet she flies first class to San Francisco, to take up residence in the cramped South of Mission apartment of her adopted sister Ginger, played by the young, greatly praised Sally Hawkins, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Happy-Go-Lucky/dp/B00BP4VWRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Happy-Go-Lucky</a>). (Both girls had been adopted by the family that took them in). Jasmine is in deep denial of what has happened to her, and is soon seen, if she hadn't been before, in her more rewarding life, abusing vodka and prescription drugs.  With no training whatsoever in the field, she claims to be an interior decorator, and catches the eye of Dwight, a wealthy young diplomat, played by Peter Sarsgaard, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Electric-Mist/dp/B001UGB1X8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Electric Mist</a>).  A cleaned-up Andrew Dice Clay plays Augie, Ginger's ex-husband, bitter because Alec and Jasmine cheated him and Ginger out of their $200,000 lottery winnings. Bobby Cannavale plays Ginger's working class boyfriend.  Louis C.K. plays Al, Jasmine's idea of a more suitable boyfriend for her sister.  The moody, flavorful cinematography is by Javier Aguirresarabe; production design by the adept Santo Loquasto.

The beauteous and greatly present Blanchett certainly dominates and carries the film, and it is her performance filling the seats at one of its maker's more commercially successful recent movies.  But the picture does have its notable flaws.  It hints, as do his recent films, that its maker Allen doesn't very often leave the elegant haunts of the super-rich.  Last time I was in San Francisco, the South of Mission area (SoMa) was considered gentrifying rapidly, as the young and adventurous, and artistic types moved in.  Ginger's funky apartment looked fun to me, though it is undoubtedly cramped with two boisterous boys and the sour Jasmine.  Jasmine runs into Augie in Union Square, one of SF's toniest shopping areas, but director Allen has Clay looking, sounding, and eating like a Bronx-based janitor.  The smooth Alec might be transplanted from a boulevardier in an earlier drawing room comedy.

Many, many viewers and critics have remarked that the picture seems a riff on ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" an immortal Pulitzer Prize winning 1947 play written by American playwright Tennessee Williams.  (It was filmed in 1951, under the same name,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Streetcar-Named-Desire/dp/B00124LYHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Streetcar Named Desire</a>, with an all-star cast headed by Vivien Leigh, Marlon Brando, and Kim Hunter.) And, of course, San Francisco is as well-known for its streetcars as New Orleans, the setting of STREETCAR. Bobby Cannavale's wounded tough-guy resembles  Marlon Brando's Stanley Kowalski .  And, similarly to the Blanche DuBois character in the earlier work, Jasmine is publicly breaking down and coming apart.  She says, ""Anxiety, nightmares and a nervous breakdown, there's only so many traumas a person can withstand until they take to the streets and start screaming.""  The picture opens with her nonstop haranguing an unfortunate older woman who just happens to be sitting next to her on a plane, and cannot move elsewhere.  Later she harangues nonstop an unfortunate woman who just happens to be sitting next to her on a SF bench.  This woman, however, can and does move elsewhere.  The woman on the plane, after she disembarks, tells her husband about her experience.  She tells him she didn't know what to do in the situation.  And there, you have, to me, the biggest difference between BLUE JASMINE and STREETCAR.  Jasmine is coming apart before them, but nobody knows what to do about it, and nobody does anything.  In STREETCAR, Blanche's sister Stella, most likely legally the only person empowered to do so, gets help for her: she is taken to an asylum by a doctor, who appears, memorably, to be kind.  His kindness prompts Blanche's most famous line, ""I have always relied on the kindness of strangers."" In BLUE JASMINE, filmed more than 60 years later, only Jasmine's sister Ginger would legally be able to help her, but the thought never seems to cross her mind.  And for all we know, Jasmin might be in danger of committing suicide.  Not what you'd call progress.

Still, it's a picture worth seeing, with a commanding performance by Blanchett as a woman who is a stranger in a strange land, intense, unlikeable, sympathetic, pathetic, clueless, charming and fragile.",1380931200,3,6059,6.236494597839136
5832108,4,B00DL47RQ2,"The acting by the leading lady and the fellow who played her prospective brother-in-law were Academy Award nomination worthy.

The scene when he says that he was able to get his son to live with him instead of his ex-wife seemed as if he was ad-libbing his own lines. Andrew Dice Clay surprised by acting disciplined. His performance should give him a few more legitimate acting opportunities.

All this said, Woody Allen wrote a brilliant script- so superior to the garbage out there that he should be given the Academy Award automatically without needing to compete. However, his editing and cutting of the film was amateurish. His use of flashbacks made the story line confusing at times rather than being helpful.

5832109,5,B00DL47RQ2,"I read the review of BJ in Vanity Fair and was struck by a remark either in the review or in a comment: Allen is ""cruel to his characters.""

First of all, let's remind ourselves that being cruel to fictional people is not the same as being cruel to real people. Second, to be kind to a fictional character is often to deny ""hard love"" to one's audience - by failing to play out the consequences of certain bad character traits and some evil or stupid decisions.

Another remark I noted was that Allen ""offers no catharsis."" Perhaps Classical Greek drama could offer release of a kind  to its audience because their legendary settings were even then a bit removed from the audience's everyday lives (as perhaps dramas set in the US South are removed from the daily lives of Northeasten and West Coast elites). Why should Allen be supplying ""closure"" like a sleeping pill?

***SPOILER ALERT***

Three things struck me about Jasmine/Jeanette French:

1) how she dropped her university schooling merely to marry some man who had ""future of untold wealth"" written in lemon juice across his handsome face with its winning smile. Her major was anthropology, which, if you are a frivolous person, is often just a playing at a colonial fantasy ;

2) what really upset her about her husband. It wasn't his criminality. It was his cheating on her - and, perhaps more importantly his doing so with increasing indiscretion. One complicating factor is that in the affair that broke the camel 's back, Hal was claiming he was in love with a French au pair. That provokes not a few questions about him and his attitude to Jasmine. And how lightning swift was her call to the FBI! The verb ""resorting"" cannot even be used.

3) the reference to ""genes"" being the advantage that Jeanette has always had over her sister. ""Aryan"" vs. ""Semite""/""Mediterranean"" perhaps? Need we go THERE, now that we've trashed capitalism American-style?",1379721600,3,1914,4.778787878787878

5832111,1,B00DL47RQ2,"""Blue Jasmine""'s ineptitude angered and offended me. Moviegoers deserve better than this amateurish botch. This review reveals key plot points. Don't read this review if you don't want to know what happens. Let's face it, though, not a lot happens in ""Blue Jasmine."" What does happen onscreen is devoid of artistic truth, verisimilitude, insight or craft.

Jasmine (Cate Blanchett) is the beautiful widow of Hal Francis, a Bernie-Madoff like corrupt wheeler-dealer. The FBI has caught up with Hal and arrested him. He commits suicide in prison. Jasmine travels from NYC to San Francisco to live with her sister, Ginger (Sally Hawkins). Ginger used to be married to Augie (Andrew Dice Clay) but Ginger is currently involved with Chili (Bobby Cannavale.)

Jasmine tries to make a go of it. There is some tension as she is living in her sister's apartment. Jasmine gets a job, meets a man, and studies interior decorating. Things go badly and the movie ends exactly as it begins: with Jasmine talking to herself.

And that's it. That's the entire waste-of-your-time movie.

The premise is tremendous: how the wife of a Bernie-Madoff style wheeler dealer copes with her sudden stratospheric loss of income and prestige. Does she sink or swim? Is she redeemed or doomed? ""Blue Jasmine"" does nothing with those fascinating questions. Things are at the end of the movie exactly as they were at the beginning.

Woody Allen wrote a lifeless, inept script.

Allen tosses one potential plot element into the film after another: the aforementioned loss of money and status, mental illness, abusive relationships, adultery, prescription drugs, class relations, sister relationships, adoption, step parenting, sexual harassment at the workplace. Then Allen does absolutely nothing with any of these.

We see Hal kissing women not his wife. We see Augie talking to Hal about money. We see working class people drinking beer and watching sports on TV. None of this goes anywhere. It's all just aborted, disjointed scenes with zero verisimilitude; hollow scenes that arouse not one whit of care or involvement. I didn't believe anything in this movie. Every character's dialogue sounds so similar that I was painfully aware that it was not real people's speech, but words written by Woody Allen. Events occur with no believability.

Jasmine drops a dime on Hal as soon as he tells her that he wants to leave her for another woman. A con artist of Hal's magnitude would not do something so nave as to tell his wife, who knows of his financial misdeeds, that he is going to dump her. She would obviously get revenge the only way she can - by immediately phoning the FBI.

Ginger is a two dimensional character. No reason is given for her to do anything she does, including taking in Jasmine. Jasmine had been rude to her earlier in the film, and Ginger is not a particularly nice person. The movie takes pains to tell us that Jasmine and Ginger were adopted, and this information serves no point whatsoever. There's no reason for Ginger to have two men: Augie and Chili are virtually the same character. Jasmine has a step son; there's no reason for him not to be her real son.

The movie tells us that Jasmine is on edge, alone and without resources. The movie lies; in other scenes, the movie tells us that Jasmine is utterly irresistible to men. Every man she meets wants to make love to her, date her, and marry her. Surely one of Hal's friends, as soon as Hal went to prison, would have scooped up luscious Jasmine, and Jasmine would have accepted.

The movie tells us that Jasmine is the kind of resourceful woman who can be born poor and marry one of the richest men in the country. How did that change and how did Jasmine become a pathetic basket case? It's just not believable.

A diplomat proposes marriage to Jasmine after dating her for about fifteen minutes. Not believable. Then he immediately cancels the engagement because Jasmine is not what he had thought. Also not believable.

It's impossible to care about any of the characters in the film, from the smarmy dentist to the diplomat who proposes to Jasmine, not just because none of them are nice or even rational people, but because they are boring, two dimensional, and lifeless.

Cate Blanchett's performance is excellent. I did get sick of the tic Allen had her, or allowed her, to perform over and over: shaking Xanax tablets out of a brown prescription bottle into her hand and swallowing them down, followed by a swig of vodka. This gesture was repeated so many times it became stale. Yes, yes, we get it - Jasmine is a nervous wreck.

This movie bugs me because it is so amazingly badly made. The most basic manual on how to construct a plot or develop a character would have steered Allen away from the choices he made. I'm angry that reviewers gave his mess a thumb's up. It's troubling that there are gifted scriptwriters out there who can't get produced while Allen's big name lures filmgoers.",1379203200,20,4955,4.812941176470588

Worst of all, Allen shows no interest in San Francisco's cultural landscape - hence the endless flashbacks to his New York comfort zone. Unlike ""Midnight in Paris"" (2011) and ""Match Point"" (2005), Woody never seems engaged with the material. Plot and character details simply fall by the wayside.

I really wanted to like this movie but it was impossible to empathize with any of the main characters - primarily vacuous shells of people.  The only decent acting in the movie was by Andrew Dice Clay and Bobby Cannavale with relatively minor parts.  Bottom line - Woody Allen needs garbage bag sized containers of antidepressants - stat!

5832114,4,B00DL47RQ2,"Woody Allen has evolved from writer/director and sometime actor of comedies to dark dramas and various permutations.  Besides being one of the most prolific artists in moviemaking history, most of his films have been marked by strong storylines populated with colorful characters, sharp dialogue, and often ironic endings. Blue Jasmine is the latest film to showcase Allen's talent (yes at 77 he is very much in command of his medium), and he gets a bravura performance by Cate Blanchett.

Jasmine (Blanchett) is a flamboyant soul who is flying from New York to San Francisco to stay with her sister, Ginger (Sally Hawkins).  Married to a successful businessman, Hal (Alec Baldwin), Jasmine has a life of high society and wealth.  But Hal is not what he seems, and she experiences the fallout from his womanizing and crooked investments.  This sets off a chain reaction of loss for the now penniless wife and mother.  Now dependent on the kindness of her sister who lost a life savings courtesy of Hal, she tries to find employment at a dentist office and take classes to find a career.  She is desperate and dependent on others, and when she meets Dwight (Peter Sarsgaard), the man of her dreams, the only thing between herself and nirvana is her hidden past.

How to describe Jasmine? She is self absorbed, selfish, despondent, manic, alcoholic, vain, delusional, traumatized, judgmental, spoiled, and above all, depressed.  She is oblivious to the obvious and in denial of her reality.  Mentally unhinged and humiliated, she is a walking contradiction who indulges in lies and babbles to herself.

The film employs stream of consciousness flashbacks that may seem abrupt at first, but you quickly see the device as a rapid succession of background information on how Jasmine's life has been filled with status and means only to devolve as Hal's philandering history is revealed.

Allen has a gift for observing and depicting real people in conflict.  Both sisters come from different walks of life.  Both yearn for happiness, and yet when Jasmine falls on hard times, Ginger is there for her despite a rocky history together. There are obvious class divisions between the rich and poor, and the irony here is that Jasmine is now one of the latter.  There are obvious parallels to A Streetcar Named Desire, but Jasmine just might be more disturbed than Blanche DuBois.  In fact a case can be made that Jasmine will evolve into a character not unlike Judi Dench's pathetic spinster in Notes on a Scandal (also starring Blanchett).

Kudos go to the usual Allen ensemble of top performers particularly Hawkins as the charitable sibling and Baldwin as a Bernie Madoff /Casanova.  Andrew Dice Clay has a supporting role as a man from Ginger's past who figures prominently later, and Louis C. K. is convincing as a romantic suitor who diverts Ginger from her boyfriend Chili (Bobby Cannavale).  But Blanchett inhabits her role in an eerie way; you believe her and all her quirks and mannerisms.  She is a mess of a person, and her struggles to find happiness and financial security are fleeting.  It's the sort of performance that earns an actress the Oscar.

It is nice to see Allen expand his films' settings from his traditional New York environs to other locales, lately Europe and now San Francisco.  The film is beautifully shot in New York and California by Javier Aguirresarobe (Vicki Cristina Barcelona).  As usual, Allen employs period songs to accent a mood or scene especially the ironic tune ""A Good Man Is Hard to Find"".

As with the best Allen dramas like Interiors, Crimes and Misdemeanors and Match Point, the lead characters are imperfect people with serious problems, and it causes them to do desperate things that don't always work.  Allen does not always have happy endings in his dramas, and you get the impression that this story may not end well.  Life can be cruel, and in Blue Jasmine, how we deal with it can be a tortuous journey.",1378425600,3,3954,4.889055472263868

It's not a life she has been accustomed to living.

BLUE JASMINE is not, as a few reviewers declare, a rehash of Tennessee Williams's STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE...nor the imagined life of one real-life Ruth Madoff, the wife of disgraced swindler Bernie Madoff. And it's not a ""moral fable of greed and comeuppance."" It's a tale of comedown not comeuppance...too much pride in material possessions. A story of a lonely woman who has lost almost all of her worldly possessions, who tries to cope with circumstance, who musters enough charm to almost nab a younger and wealthy man-about-town; a woman who wanders through a few more weeks of life without luxury.

Accompanying Cate Blanchett's brilliant turn as Jasmine is a well-selected supporting cast. The sister Ginger (Sally Hawkins) is a spunky young gal, divorced with two sons, who works as cashier and stock clerk in a small grocery; her differing looks are explained as genetics... both Ginger and Jasmine are adopted. Ginger's boy friend Chili (Bobby Cannavale) looks like George Peppard's punk son with tattoos and dark hair. The swindler husband is played straight by a handsome and svelte Alec Baldwin. Andrew Dice Clay cleans up his act to become Ginger's ex-husband Augie.

Director Woody Allen, not a personal favorite of mine until lately, has tried to tell us about downward spirals of life. He has his main character mutter about what was, what could have been, and what is now. He answers Jasmine's question of ""Where am I, exactly?"" with ""nowhere.""

And perhaps has his audience wonder where they are....exactly.",1378425600,2,2279,5.0828877005347595
5832116,4,B00DL47RQ2,"Woody Allen has been excellent in cinematically portraying (and poking fun at) various aspects of growing up absurd in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Manhattan, growing up as Jewish kid with a very subtle sense of the outsider coming inside as things changed in the post- World War II American sociological landscape. Changed in the red scare cold war night of the 1950s which charged everyone from Jewish kids in Brooklyn (and those other city locales) to Irish-Catholic kids from Hullsville on the Massachusetts shoreline to turn in vanilla Americans. Check. Woody Allen has been excellent in cinematically portraying the East Coast-West Coast culturati warfare (now decidedly won by the Left Coast). Check. Woody Allen has been excellent in transferring his comedic writing and directing skills to Europe over the past few films. Check. Which leads us to the few under review, Blue Jasmine,  his updated echo of Tennessee Williams' dramatic look (Street Car Named Desire, The Rose Tattoo, with a touch of Suddenly, Last Summer)  at how the mighty (or one mighty) has followed in the post-2008 world of high stakes high finance.  In short a look at class in contemporary America, a small snapshot of the one-sided class war where the good guys are not winning but maybe, just maybe they will survive.

We have known ever since F. Scott Fitzgerald that the rich, hell, the very rich and not just the ordinary rich, are different, very different, from you and me and Woody here tries to rub our noses in this difference even when the rich are on the way down, down into the mean streets (here of Frisco town). I am not altogether convinced, at least off of this film presentation, that he succeeded in that effort. What I am convinced of though is that Cate Blanchett (and to a lesser extent Bobby Cannavale and Sally Hawkins as two working -class characters) saved his bacon on this one by both breathing life into the character of Jasmine and by flooding the screen with one of the most nuanced performances in her outstanding career.  Beautifully mannered and at home amount the rich and famous or manic, alcoholic and nothing but a drag on company she forced the viewer to deal with her presence. Woody on his own on this one, at least based on the story line and the over the top dialogue, could not have pulled as much power out of this film without that performance.

Here is why. Through the devise of having to two non-biologically connected sisters (Jasmine and Ginger), the one upscale with great expectation Hamptons dreams and the other strictly working class with small, or maybe no dreams, maybe just trying to keep above water, Woody is able give him take a look at class society in contemporary post-crash America. And it ain't pretty, even for the fallen of the one percent. Except Jasmine steadfastly refuses to believe there was any such thing as downward mobility in the world (downward mobility courtesy of a reckless wheeler-dealer husband played by Alex Baldwin who turns out to have been just another guy working the age-old Ponzi scheme and who also committed suicide in prison after she turned him in). And so she lives in her own little universe, keeps her own sense of self up  by berating Ginger and her obvious working class ethos (pizza and television sports, sex, hell, maybe even bowling) and by scheming to get back on top anyway she can. Unsuccessfully as the film ends, and end though where she is as befuddled by her life and its downward drift as when she started. And that may say more about Allen's ability to do more than make stock figures out of his characters than what was possible to explore here. What you see this one for really is the performance by Cate Blanchett, and you should see that.",1378339200,,3733,4.760432766615147
5832117,4,B00DL47RQ2,"All 45+ movies directed by Woody Allen start identically, first, with the black screen for few moments, and then white-on-black credits, placed with the perfect symmetry in the Windsor typeface, and set to jazz music. The empty black screen in the beginning is like Malevich's black square that can content anything behind it. Watching it for few seconds before the movie starts is for the Allen's fan the sweetest moment of anticipation the new work from the favorite filmmaker. Where will he take us this time? Following the fallen celestial being named Jasmine from the Mt. Olympus on Manhattan to the lowland of San Francisco Bay area, Woody Allen and Cate Blanchett have created the special treat for the movie lovers.

I don't know what took Woody Allen and Cate Blanchett so long but finally the match that was meant to be blessed by the movie gods took place and produced one of the strongest ever Woody Allen's dramatic films with what could be the best single performance in his movie, and that tells a lot.

Woody Allen and Cate Blanchet use the familiar setting of the great classical American play by Tennessee Williams ""The street car named desire"" but re-invented it by moving plot to the modern days of the post 2008 financial crisis and the collapse of the largest Ponzi scheme in the history of the USA. The film takes place in San Francisco and in flashbacks goes to the posh Manhattan apartment, trendy restaurants, five stars hotels, and Hamptons summer house where Blanchett's character, Jasmine Francis used to lead the life of the elegant socialite, the wife of the Wall Street financial wizard, Hal (Alec Baldwin effortlessly effective as a smooth-talking charming silver-tongued rascal who made his fortune by ruining millions of people with his ruthless machinations). ""Blue Jasmine"" is announced as a comedy but it is a very dark comedy or rather tragicomedy and it concerns two very different sisters, Jasmine (Blanchett) and Ginger (Sally Hawkins. Both adapted as the babies, Jasmine (one with the good genes) was determined, beautiful, smart, went to college, found a very rich husband and moved to the higher social step. Kind and simple Ginger had a construction worker husband, two children, a menial job, and one chance to make a better life for her family when she and her husband Augie won a lottery and made the trip to New York City to celebrate with Jasmine and Hal and to ask Hal about the best investment of 200K lottery money. Needless to say that after having invested in one of the Hal's schemes, Ginger and Augie never saw a penny of their money. Andrew Dice Clay, famous as a stand-up comedian, gave a moving performance as Augie which is not surprising at all. Looks like simply being in Allen's movie brings forward everything an actor is capable of. Blue Jasmine is not exception, and every actor gives memorable performance even in the small roles. Sally Hawkins as Ginger is admirable. Ginger's live has never been easy or glamorous but she accepts whatever good it has to offer, she does not expect much and she is able to keep her sanity, reason, and good spirits which can't be said about Jasmine.

When Jasmine's life collapses along with the fall of her husband's financial empire, she loses everything including her grip to reality and is forced to turn to very person she never thought of while being on top of the world, her sister Ginger. Moving from NYC to SF, staying with her sister in a small ""homey"" apartment and trying to do something with herself, to move on with her life, to make sense of it, Jasmine in Blanchett's performance is a complex multifaceted and hard to forget person. She is selfish, delusional, weak, depressed, classy, charming, scared, confused, and feverish. She is visibly suffocating living the life she knows nothing about and she does not want to know about. She is ashamed of herself, of what she became, of how low she has fallen, while she believes that she is entitled to the finest things in life. There is obvious guilt she carries with her. She is truly a fish out of water. She tries to adjust to the real world but she has no skills for survival in it on her own. With one gesture, one look, one change of facial expression, Blanchet takes Jasmine from hopes to turmoil to despair, from glitz and glamour of the recent past to the uncertainty and fear of present, and watching her impetuous sudden transformations is heartbreaking. I've been Cate Blanchett's fan for many years and I treasure every role I've seen her in but in Woody Allen's ""Blue Jasmine"" she is more than superb or excellent. She is beyond any superlatives. There is no single false note in her performance. I did not want to feel sorry or sympathize with Jasmine. Comparing to Blanche Dubois with whom a lot of critics and viewers identify her, Jasmine was guilty of at least an act of deliberate cruelty which is unforgivable, and she knew it. But, differently from Blanche, by the time the movie starts, Jasmine is not on the verge but beyond a nervous breakdown and watching her trying to deal with it, helping herself with vodka martinis and Xanax while having delusions of superiority and fading hope of somehow be able to move on, to pull herself through, and bursting in the sudden agitated talking to herself on the streets, on the park benches, on the plain sit, makes a viewer to feel for her against their best instincts. You simply can't take your eyes off her for a second. This is a master class in acting, authenticity, and humanity by Cate Blanchett, the most talented actor (of both genders) of her generation in the best serious film by Woody Allen.

""Blue Jasmine"" is a beautiful movie to look at. San Francisco and NYC, two cities-antipodes look marvelous under the Javier Aguirresarobe's camera but the best visual treats come from seamless flashbacks that added so much to the story of paradise (with plenty of snakes lurking ) lost. Whatever flaws the film might have, like using some characters or their convenient appearances in the right time in the right places as merely plot devices, don't matter much in presence of greatness whose name is Cate Blanchett.

But let's imagine for a second that the movie was as much about one woman's loss of her fairy tale life and about class differences in the modern society as it was about some of Woody Allen's own life experiences: his memory of being in the eye of public disgrace and scandal, his own son's refusal to have anything to do with his father, and his perception of the greatest disaster of all - being shut off from the only thing in life that matters to him, which is making movies. In that case, Allen's gave the face to his own nightmares, disasters, and regrets, and that is Jasmine's face in the final scene of his latest, dark and great film.

5832118,3,B00DL47RQ2,"Much has been made about Cate Blanchett's performance and I am in total accord with the acclaim.  She played ""Blanche DuBois"" in ""Streetcar Names Desire"" on Broadway and I'm sure that that did a lot to inform and deepen her performance as ""Jasmine"" here.  (It's interesting that her last name in ""Blanchett""---maybe these are roles she was born to play?)  At any rate she is wonderful here and in my opinion, she rescued the role from what could have been a two dimensional caricature.

Sally Hawlings, too, was very good as her sister, and saved her from being another working class stereotype.  Her various men friends are fun to watch but I'm afraid they do fall into the category of types.  Another reviewer commented that they seem to be more from New Jersey than San Francisco.  Alec Baldwin is the quintessential charming bad guy...maybe another role he was born to play?  The rest of the cast is just fine, too.

Cinematography is great, costumes, scenery...all first rate.  The only problem I had with the film was the script.  And that's major.  I don't think Allen decided if this is to be a satire or comedy, a farce or a political comment, a human tragedy or a morality play.  It is engaging, as all of Allen's films are and Blanchett takes the ball and runs with it.  She's so interesting to watch and so beautiful, that the time in the theater flew by until the credits rolled...when I heard people all over the theater say ""That's it?""  Yes, those of us who go to art-house films are supposed to be grown up and not expect ""Hollywood"" endings where ""everything's wrapped up neatly in a bow"" but still it would have been nice to have some sense of resolution.  It was sort of like a Beethovan symphony where Beethovan forgets to put in the final chords.

As for the comparison to ""Streetcar"" the difference between Williams and Allen is that Williams loved his characters so  when  Blanche was taken away to the insane asylum the viewer wept.  It was a true tragedy.  As for Jasmine here, I didn't shed any tears. In spite of all that Blanchett did to bring a soul to her she still remains someone I didn't really care about.  It's not her fault and I hope she gets the Oscar nomination she deserves.  Acting students may well want to watch the film for her performance.  For me that's the only reason to see it.",1378166400,3,2327,4.538461538461538
5832119,5,B00DL47RQ2,"Glancing at the fifteen-odd reviews before mine, more than one describes writer-director Woody Allen's 2013 film BLUE JASMINE as ""his best in a long time"" or ""best in quite a while.""  Isn't that what people said about Allen's MIDNIGHT IN PARIS, which came out in 2011, two years earlier?  Is that a long time or really quite a while between making great films?

What a nice problem to have, contributing such an impressive body of work that there is no one to top but yourself.  I, for one, take high expectations a Woody Allen title but he usually meets or exceeds them.  Except for TO ROME WITH LOVE, with which I have yet to catch up, the last of his films I did not like enough to view more than once was CASSANDRA'S DREAM, from 2007.  I will see BLUE JASMINE a second time, maybe a third.

Cate Blanchett was only in one film I knew, an Indiana Jones flick, before starring in BLUE JASMINE.  I don't remember her in the Jones movie but won't forget her in this one.  If Blanchett does not get an Oscar nomination, then Meryl Streep will have to have had all the other female lead roles in 2013.  It would not surprise me to see supporting cast members Andrew Dice Clay and Bobby Cannavale receive acting nominations, too.

Oh, so what's BLUE JASMINE about?  It's about kidding yourself by way of kidding others and hoping you get home before midnight, when your carriage turns into a pumpkin.

5832122,5,B00DL47RQ2,"This is clearly one of Woody Allen's best films, and a case can be made that it is in fact his best. It is also among his very best acted films. If Cate Blanchett does not win an Oscar for her lead, it will be proof that acting doesn't count as much anymore as it should in Oscar picks.

Cate plays a character that is not ordinarily the object of much empathy or compassion: the wife of a big-time, financial crook (played under Allen's direction with great credibility and balance by Alec Baldwin). Here however, you cannot help but feel every ounce of her pain as she struggles mightily to survive the ordeal of falling from having it all to being penniless by way of being spotted by a close friend selling shoes in a store where they once shopped together. Throughout, the nominally ""comedic relief"" does not provide relief at all. Under Allen's script and direction, it sharply intensifies this woman's relentless pain. ""Pain"" may indeed be too soft a word for the daily agony she endures from her past, her present circumstances, her choices all along the way, and from the men with whom she comes into contact. While her circumstances are her own, under Allen's script and direction, her intense shame is universally discomforting.

Were this the substance of Allen's film, it might be viewed as merely a cautionary tale, encouraging women to better understand what exactly their husbands do for a living. However, there is much, much more going on. Sally Hawkins gives a performance that shows us the plight of another woman in the person of the adopted sister of Cate's character. She is with no particular gifts, tastes, or morals, yet she remains a sensitive and profoundly vulnerable individual, worthy of our compassion. I suspect that Allen uses her character to broaden the pathos from one individual woman to the gender as a whole. The main story revolves around Cate's character, but it becomes so intertwined with the story of Sally's that it appears to be about two very different women representing the foibles that lead to the bad choices of all women, and to their mistreatment by men.

This viewer walked out of the film emotionally drained, wondering if this was one of the best dramas he had seen in decades, AND wondering whether it belonged in his collection of best dramas. It is a hard movie to watch for all the right reasons. The characters are tough and well drawn. The acting is superb to the point that you cease to believe you are watching a film (until one scene, when you realize that Cate should have a lock on the Best Actress Oscar).

Do not take the kids to see this film, and do what you can to remember that a film of equal emotional weight could be made showing how men are just as vulnerable and just as devastated by their choices, and by their callous mistreatment by women. In the end, we are all made vulnerable by our attachments to the illusory pleasures of life, and we are all victimized by the failure of others to treat us with the same empathy, compassion, and generosity they want from us. Allen may not have packed all this into Blue Jasmine, but on the other hand, he very well may have. See the film and decide or yourself.",1377648000,,3184,4.610229276895944
5832123,4,B00DL47RQ2,"Woody Allen's 45th film takes him away from his recent foray's to Europe and plants his cast in San Francisco with extended flashback scenes in New York.  While the situation is hardly funny, there are enough elements to certainly put the film in the category of dark comedy.  Jasmine (Cate Blanchett) is the wife of Hal (Alec Baldwin), a wealthy beyond description, investment banker who just so happens to be a white collar crook, unbeknownst to Jasmine.  She is the woman who knows how to live the good life but pays no attention to what's going on around her, especially when it comes to business.  Her business is shopping and hosting elaborate dinner parties.

We find much of this out as Jasmine visits her sister, now single Ginger (Sally Hawkins) and her two bratty sons.  Each make a big point out of the fact that they are not biological sisters.  Both were adopted and raised by the same family, but Ginger always says, Jasmine has the better genes.  Ginger, by Jasmine's account has the worst taste in men beginning with her husband Augie who is in construction.  He's played surprisingly well by Andrew Dice Clay.  Upon Jasmine's arrival, Ginger is about to get engaged to Chili, a mechanic played by Bobby Cannavale.

Both men are a little rough around the edges and certainly the antithesis of smooth and sophisticated Hal.  But yeah, Hal's a crook.  Not only that, he's a womanizer and everyone knew, except for Jasmine.  Or maybe she knew and just looked the other way.  Enough was enough and in a fit of rage Jasmine, pulls the plug on Hal's business shenanigans.  Jasmine had no idea that the government would strip her of all of her wealth as well.

Allen turns Blanchett loose on her character and she is amazing, going from a beautiful socialite concerned about appearances and her next visit to the Mediterranean to a groveling drunk on high doses of Xanax.  A woman with no visible skills, no money and no idea of how to proceed, she's a train wreck.  You'll feel sorry for her by the end of the film.  While Blanchett's performance is sure to get Oscar's attention, the rest of the film bogs down much too often, going over some of the same territory.  While I thought Clay's performance was an eye opener, Louis C. K.'s as a married man having a brief fling with Ginger, wasn't.

Some equate this with ""A Streetcar Named Desire."" I can see that. But there is an additional layer of difficulty--as Jasmine (the character played by Blanchett) creates realities that are not accurate. She speaks of an idyllic start to her romance with her husband (a Bernie Madoff-like phony) and yet played a key role in his downfall.

She wrecked a relationship with her son; she closed her eyes to possible irregularities in her husband's financial work.

5832126,5,B00DL47RQ2,"Woody Allen's new film, Blue Jasmine, is definitely his best since 2011's Midnight in Paris and arguably his best since Bullets Over Broadway (1994) and Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989). Though the film has comic touches, thematically it is a serious character study centered around a woman named Jasmine, a New York socialite whose life has fallen apart and who has been forced by circumstances to move in with her semi-estranged sister, Ginger, who lives in a walk-up apartment in a working-class part of San Francisco.

The film begins with Jasmine (Cate Blanchett) on a plane to San Francisco, talking non-stop to an older woman who happened to have the seat next to her. As the scene goes on, we quickly realize that the poor woman has been inadvertently sucked into the situation and is only waiting for her chance to escape, which finally comes at the baggage check-out. Not everyone in the film will be so lucky, particularly Ginger (Sally Hawkins), her sister in San Francisco whom Jasmine is descending upon to stay with until she can get back on her feet. This, we learn, make take some doing as flashbacks reveal that Jasmine's life has recently taken a nasty downward spiral. Her husband, Hal (Alec Baldwin), was a financier who provided the high New York socialite lifestyle that Jasmine always felt was her due. But then the dream life came apart when Hal was arrested for fraud, convicted and ultimately committed suicide in prison, leaving Jasmine with nothing after the government seized all of their assets. And leaving only Ginger as a haven of refuge, albeit a somewhat reluctant haven as Ginger and her then-husband Augie (Andrew Dice Clay) invested - and lost - all of their money in one of Hal's fraudulent ventures, something that Jasmine steadfastly holds herself blameless for. Also less than thrilled is Ginger's current boyfriend, Chili (Bobby Canavale), who finds Jasmine's sudden arrival interfering with his and Ginger's plans to move in together.

In addition to a tight, intricately-woven script, Woody Allen is known for bringing out the best performances in his actors, which is why so many actors will jump at the chance at being in one of his films. And Blue Jasmine is no exception. The cast was well-chosen and the performances resonate, none more so than Cate Blanchett's Jasmine. In a truly Oscar-worthy turn, Blanchett brings out Jasmine's inherent unlikability, the socialite who blocks out anything she doesn't want to know or deal with and regards her own shallow existence as the only one that could possibly have any meaning, while at the same time making us feel sympathy for her in her downfall, not because she earns, let alone deserves it, but simply because she is so utterly blind to the consequences of her own behavior. If there is such a thing as a tragic Greek anti-heroine, Blanchett nails it in this film.

Highly, highly recommended.",1377302400,2,2892,4.946502057613169
5832127,4,B00DL47RQ2,"Woody Allen, now 77, has been on a hot streak in recent years with excellent movies like last year's ""To Rome With Love"", 2011's ""Midnight in Paris"", 2010's ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"", and 2008's ""Vicky Christina Barcelona"". Now comes his latest movie.

""Blue Jasmine"" (2013 release; 98 min.) brings the story of Jasmine (played by Cate Blanchett). As the movie opens, we see her arriving in San Francisco, moving in with her sister Ginger (played by Sally Hawkins). We soon learn that Jasmine is on the 'rebound'. The movie from there on intercuts between flashbacks of Jasmine's previous glitzy life in New York with her husband (played by Alec Baldwin) and how Jasmine is adopting to living with her sister. To tell you much more about the story would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first, writer-director Woody Allen is ageing like a good wine and in the last 5-6 years seems to have found a second (or is that third? or fourth?) wind in his career. Second, this movie bursts at the seams with outstanding acting performances. Yes, Cate Blanchett is getting a lot of press and Oscar buzz with her brilliant performance of tormented Jasmine, as well she should. But there are lots of other notables, for starters Sally Hawkins, an English actress whom I had seen before in a couple of movies (including ""An Education"") but for the first time really blew me away in her role as the insecure younger sister. Then there is Bobby Cannavale as Chili, the hot-headed boyfriend of Ginger. in an equally surprising role. And how about Peter Sarsgaard, this time in a very much restrained role as Dwight, Jasmine's possible next husband. As it happens, I just saw Sarsgaard earlier this week in another movie, ""Lovelace"", in a head-turning role that couldn't be further away from his role here.

If it sounds like I am gushing about this movie, I am. This is one of the very best movies of the year for me so far, right up there with ""Frances Ha"" (I imagine Cate Blanchett and Greta Gerwig will be duking it out for the Best Actress Oscar). Woody Allen, never one to rest on his laurels, is already shooting his next movie (set in Southern France), set to be released in '14. The screening I saw ""Blue Jasmine"" at today at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati was PACKED, and this movie has all the makings of a runaway hit on the art-house theatre circuit. If it wasn't clear yet, ""Blue Jasmine"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1376611200,,2524,4.68018018018018
5832128,5,B00DL47RQ2,"If Cate Blanchett isn't short-listed for this year's Best Actress at the Oscars, there is no justice. As a matter of fact, in this assembly of award-winning actors directed by the perennial Woody Allen, there is not one weak performance.

I sat in the theater marveling at the talent and skill on display. Blanchett (from Australia) and Hawkins (from the U.K.) play American sisters without a hint of accent. Furthermore, no one in this film had to do that irritating Woody Allen stammer. This is one of Allen's most accessible films since ""Match Point.""

Look at this cast:
  * Cate Blanchett (""Hanna"") is the pampered wife of an extremely successful New York businessman, her life suffers a cataclysmic shock and she loses touch with reality, so she seeks shelter with her divorced sister. (She has won an Oscar among many other honors.)
  * Alec Baldwin (""Rock of Ages"") is her husband, suave, handsome and (we can tell) smarmy. Baldwin relishes roles like this. (He has won numerous Emmys.)
  * Sally Hawkins (""Made in Dagenham"") is her sister, a single parent in a tiny walk-up, but willing to try to help. (She won a Golden Globe.)
  * Bobby Cannavale (""Win Win"") plays another ebullient character, outspoken, honest and very appealing. (He won an Emmy.)
  * Andrew Dice Clay (""Entourage"") is our gal's former brother-in-law; he has a way of condensing all of her faults into three statements. (He won a Razzie(!)
  * Peter Sarsgaard (""An Education"") walks into our gal's life just in the nick of time! (He won BSFC Award.)

This excellently crafted PG-13 script slowly unveils events in Jasmine's past. We couldn't help but hear the mature-man/teenage-lover defense with Mr. Allen's notorious past in mind, and some of the relationships evoked echoes of Tennessee Williams' ""Streetcar..."" Between Allen and Blanchett, they have created a realistic and relatable melt-down!

I love it when there are no bad guys or good guys, just people with human failings and various levels of desperation, trying to get by. Amazon will notify me when the DVD is available.",1376006400,5,2065,4.959302325581396
5832129,3,B00DL47RQ2,"The film bounces back and forth between Cate Blanchett's life before and after her fall from grace.  Although the story line is easy to follow, the social message the movie delivers is disconnected.  Woody could have tied it all in a nice tight emotional package, but some of the emotional impact was left on the table.

Also, the story takes place mostly in San Francisco, which was a waste, since most of the main characters possessed a definite New York look and feel.  Why shoot a movie in San Francisco when the movie is about New Yorkers?  A great film maker would have used the setting in order to accentuate the story line or message, but frankly this movie could have been shot in any major city without much effect.

Entertaining enough, but I wasn't challenged by the movie and got bored part of the way through it.",1375660800,8,826,4.547297297297297
