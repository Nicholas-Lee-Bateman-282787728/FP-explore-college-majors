4488874,1,B004WOAGCC,"I have seen many many movies in my life and this one takes the cake as being the biggest waste of time, terrible film I have EVER seen.  Honestly, to think someone actually made this movie makes me believe anyone can make a movie.  Everything about this movie is just so bad it makes me want to vomit.",1315785600,3,301,4.172413793103448
4488875,4,B004WOAGCC,"For what it is,Flesh Wounds is a good movie,although I can see the comparisons to Predator. Kevin Sorbo does a good job of playing Lt. Tyler,comannder of a special ops force. As is usually the case in Sorbo's movies,there is a pretty woman,who,through no fault of her own,causes more trouble than the team really needs,but eventually earns their trust. They soon discover that their real enemy is something created by their own government-the perfect soldier,part man and part machine,who has lost control. With time running out,it's either kill or be killed,and Lt. Tyler much prefers the former. If you like action-adverneture films,this may be one movie you will want to check out!",1312070400,3,684,5.116071428571429
4488876,1,B004WOAGCC,"""If these guys can't fix it, Hell no one can.""  After a group of scientists goes missing, the army hires an elite covert team led by Tyler (Sorbo) to go and investigate and rescue them.  When they get to the site they discover something they never could have imagined.  There really is not much to say about this movie.  The best way to explain it is that this is a Scy/Fy channel version of ""Predators"".  It is only missing the effects, action, cool bad guys and acting, other then that it is a lot like ""Predators"".  If you are a HUGE Predator or Sci-fi fan you would probebly like this, otherwise go ahead and aviod this and anyone who wants you to watch it. I give it a D.

Would I watch again? - No way!  I will not be getting this for my store.

*Also try - Predators",1311120000,7,773,4.134228187919463
4488877,4,B004WOAGCC,"This is a good movie. Made with low budget and yet great locations, the story just flows easily. We've seen movies like this before, and still it's a pleasure to watch the talented and handsome and strong actor Kevin Sorbo as a military leader searching for a scary soldier...

4488879,2,B004WOAGCC,This is a free with Amazon Prime movie.  The plot of the movie is a secret US program to make a cyborg super soldier goes out of control.  Sort of 'Universal Soldier' with a hint of 'Predator' thrown in.  It stars Kevin Sorbo.  The movie looks low budget and it seems like Kevin Sorbo did it because he needed a pay check.  I didn't hate this movie but a 2-star rating is a tad generous.  A 1.5-star rating is more like it.,1485388800,,423,4.097560975609756
4488880,1,B004WOAGCC,"So I'm thinking to myself, self, let's get good and liquored up on really cheap beer, buy an old VHS camera and a couple of tapes and go out into the Everglades and remake Predator. Let's use nothing but the lamest wanna-be B grade talent on both sides of the camera, dispense with a script or anything resembling continuity, logic or even a plot and roll tape.

What could possibly not be good about that drunken mess? Quick answer- this pile of crap. Do yourself a favor and skip it, I've wasted enough minutes for both of us.",1485216000,,528,4.387755102040816

The visual effects are trashy and visually cheap.  It's a bad Cybrog-spinoff that too closely mirrors Predator.  THe situations created are unreasonable.  In situations where you are concerned about giving your position away, the last thing you do is sneak up to 15 feet away (or on some scenes, 5 feet) from a sentry before shooting him in the back with an assault rifle.  Trainied soldiers also don't forget to prime their rifle before sneaking up to point plank range and then cursing aloud when their weapon doesn't fire.  This is a complete waste of time.  The concepts of the Cyborg could have carried the movie if they were thought through better, but the long, slow uninteresting storylione took so much of the film there wasn't time for more than a little backstory about it.",1466726400,,956,4.751515151515152

And any way this is a earth bound cyborg not an alien hunter. But all in all very low budget but I've seen a lot worse here and elsewhere. It keeps a quick pace, and gives lot's of action. But every single thing about the military it portrays is wrong! Uniforms, insignias, weapons, chain of command, discipline, training and execution in a swamp area operation. Wow. EVERYTHING WAS WRONG. There didn't need to be a cyborg any Army vet in america could have taken them out in the first few hours.

Somehow they managed to find a way around not infringing on the copyrights of the movie ""Predator"" and cause me to nearly hang myself from the roof of my house, but luckily for me I realised that when this movie is over I will wake up and realise it was only a bad dream because no one is stupid enough or bad enough at life to make this movie. This is insane and a mockery. WOW! I seriously hope this was supposed to be funny!

Before I go though, I want to make one last remark. Whoever or whatever allowed these actors to portray soldiers and the military the way they did should not be be allowed to go near a movie set again. That was a offensive and especially since I am prior service. I understand there are cheezy films that get many things about the military wrong but this was just offensive. I do not ever want to hear about this movie or talk about it ever again. This is just me warning others to avoid trauma and wasting time. Thank you!",1359331200,,1248,4.243697478991597
4489011,1,B004WOAGCC,"A shabby knockoff of Predator, Flesh Wounds sees a commando team slowly picked off in the woods by an invisible cyborg. These woods are shot through an oppressive and omnipresent yellow-green filter. This is to tell us that we are looking at the jungle, as opposed to say the woods behind the producer's house. These direct-to-video sci fi films tend to follow a pretty predictable formula, so I'll break this review down into its constituent parts:

Lone Token Celebrity:
Kevin Sorbo, AKA Hercules! But while he may have saved ancient Greece a thousand times, there's nothing the son of Zeus can do for this stinkbomb of a film.

Lesson About Man's Hubris:
Strong, but confined to the military. If you are a crooked general and you build an invisible cyborg who needs regular doses of brain chemicals, then he will probably go rogue in the jungle and eat people's brains. This is a pretty specific lesson to learn, but a good one, I guess.

Carnage:
Silly. Because squibs are expensive we see no physical evidence that anyone is shot; instead CG blood just launches out of their backs. Near the end Kevin Sorbo blows up a tin shed and it doesn't even move, let alone fall down.

Awful Effects:
SUPER awful. The cyborg's laser guns and cg look terrible. The fake blood looks terrible. The asparagus urine filter on everything looks terrible. It's ALL terrible.

Romantic Subplot:
None, although a lady CIA agent kisses Kevin Sorbo at the end. She has no reason to whatsoever.

Big Action Truck:
No truck but there are action airboats. Well, one airboat. Money doesn't grow on trees.

In conclusion, Flesh Wounds is terrible. Don't buy it.",1358726400,5,1638,4.787234042553192

4489015,1,B004WOAGCC,"""Flesh Wounds"" is really a poorly done movie.  It has a plot very similar to Predator, except for the fact that Predator made sense, and at least had some kind of interesting storyline.  This time it is a cyborg E16 instead of an alien, but the plot is inconsistent.  Yuck.

The acting in Flesh Wounds is just plain dreadful.  Kevin Sorbo looks like he is bored stiff, and the rest of the actors look like they were reading it through for the first and only time.  Yuck.

Totally unrealistic ""special ops"" team.  No military training apparent, nor any technical advisers on how real soldier might perform.  One guy carries a ""bag of guns"" so that explains how they change which weapon they are holding from scene to scene.  They stop in hostile land to smoke and chat about who is gay and whatnot.  Yuck.

The troops act like some guys picked up in a gym for their muscles and then told to play soldier.  The lone female in the group has so much makeup on she looks more ready to stroll down the runway than to hike in a swamp.  Yuck.

The action sequences are poor.  The camera work is shoddy.  The dialogue is lame to the extreme.  Yuck.

The monster/cyborg/alien is silly, and not in a good way.  Yuck.

The only passable part of ""Flesh Wounds"" was the musical score.  That was adequate.  The rest of the movie is a total waste.  Yuck.",1322265600,2,1338,4.389344262295082

8445526,1,B004WOAGCC,"Horrible. Just amazingly horrible. It's impossible to even scratch the surface of describing how horrible, but let's start with:

1) Horrible, NO-budget rip-off of Predator and Cyborg

2) Absurd situations and acting

3) Pathetic special effects (worse than low-budget)

4) NO military reality AT ALL

5) Absurd inconsistencies throughout, like a guy being told (straight from Predator), ""Watch her ass. If she tries to run, shoot her"" (when she's part of the team in the first place and has NO reason to run), but literally 2 seconds later the scene change shows the guy that was behind her and being ordered to watch her is on point and staring into the forest saying (straight from Predator), ""There's something...."" And there's the case of the migrating grenade, where the same grenade appears in three different places on the leader's person. And it goes on and on and on. Like, not $10 of the LOW budget was spent on even TRYING to have consistent footage in the final edit.

6) The predator/hunter/cyborg is a JOKE. I mean, NOT worth waiting for once you've see him/it for the first time. ROFL!!!

HORRIBLE, and anybody giving this more than the minimum one-star (I wish I could give negative stars) was buzzed when watching this or has such a low bar of what counts as even minimally worthwhile that they might as well be buzzed. Nazis At The Center Of The Earth was FAR better than this horrible piece of utter trash, and that's a one-star, Asylum film!
