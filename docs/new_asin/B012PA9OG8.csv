8726429,5,B012PA9OG8,"Watching this video is much easier than only trying to understand from reading a book.  I've studied these techniques in the past and I wish I would have been able to use the Slatkin's video 10 years ago!  Seeing the examples of how to speak to a spouse with the steps written on the screen makes these important communication strategies easier to understand and implement.  The common situations/problems they discuss are easy to relate to, so everyone can change the painful patterns in marriage.  It's worth it to watch again every few months just to brush up.  It'd be a meaningful gift for every newlywed!",1449187200,,610,4.771428571428571

These are very important skills and tools that are hard to fully understand and integrate unless you see it and hear it. Rabbi Shlomo and Rivka Slatkin of course make it look a lot easier than it will be, but thank you for putting this out. They are calm and straightforward, and easy to understand.  I love the ending: ""wishing you much success in your journey together!"" That's exactly what marriage is, and I am glad I watched this to gain/review the tools needed to having a loving relationship.",1448928000,,580,4.631067961165049
