2911174,4,B000TXPXBO,"A good 1978 remake of the historically inaccurate Prince and the Pauper saved by an excellent soundtrack and stellar cast. Mark Lester, who portrays the title characters, gives a lackluster performance, but others make up for that.",1351209600,2,231,5.27027027027027
2911175,5,B000TXPXBO,"This is an excellent telling of ""The Prince and the Pauper"" starring several of the ""Oliver"" motion picture cast (in fact, Oliver himself is all grown up as the main character). The abundance of stars in the cast make this a great movie for any fans of historical drama.",1332720000,3,270,4.530612244897959
2911176,4,B000TXPXBO,"I bought this because of the stellar cast of actors and actresses in the various supporting roles.  They performed as expected, and the movie is quite good for its type.  There are two problems.  One is just impossible to avoid, in that anyone young enough to play the two lead roles is going to be too inexperienced to really do them justice, especially if they attempt distinct accents.  The other was the sound.  If I could have muted out the overly loud an annoying music, I'd have rated it a point higher.  Still, recommended, and I find myself inspired to watch the 1974 version of the Three Musketeers again.",1327363200,,615,4.5963302752293576
2911177,5,B000TXPXBO,"another version of mark twain's ""the prince & the pauper"".  well made, very good
cast, what's not to like.  oliver reed is always a scene stealer, just like errol
flynn when he played the role.",1312761600,6,193,4.485714285714286
2911178,5,B000TXPXBO,"I saw this in either 1977 or 1978 at Radio City in NYC under a different title.  I believe it was called the Sword and the Rose?  Can anyone corroborate?  Under any title, an entirely fantastic swashbuckler!!!",1275609600,2,209,4.594594594594595
2911179,4,B000TXPXBO,"Nifty flick on the famous Twain twin saga. Just watched this again and realized how professional and well-thought-out it really is. Oliver Reed is great as Miles Hendon, soldier of fortune, with Charlton Heston and Rex Harrison also throwing their weight around. Good fun.",1234569600,21,272,5.204545454545454
2911180,4,B000TXPXBO,I enjoyed this telling of the prince and the pauper story immensely. The characters were beleivable and less campy than many versions. it's was a well made period piece.,1213833600,6,169,4.862068965517241
2911181,5,B000TXPXBO,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I would recommend it for adults because the vocabulary and content may be too difficult for younger viewers. Very true to book adaptation of Twain's novel - Mark Lester was excellent.,1207699200,20,216,5.027777777777778
2911182,5,B000TXPXBO,"Watched this many years ago when it first came out on tape.  It's been in the collection since, and I think much underrated.  Probably the title, as many don't think of this as ""The Prince and the Pauper.""  Great cast, script, scenes, everything is absolutely topnotch in this effort to create cinema on Mark Twain's first attempt at a fictional ""historical novel.""  You'll enjoy it if you've not yet seen it.",1204070400,24,409,4.71830985915493

2911184,5,B000TXPXBO,"A light hearted Prince and Pauper [Mark Twain] story, featuring big named actors that will delight you. Unlike today's spoofy not-believable TV  versions in modern expressions and are for the dim witted, this tale is worth your time. We got it for Charleston Heston's performance, and also found Rex Harrison to be his stageworthy self.  A great actor.",1410048000,6,352,5.051724137931035

2911186,4,B000TXPXBO,"I found this to be a surprisingly interesting revision of that old story, The Prince and The Pauper, excellently performed by a slew of well known actors.  The original was more of a child's story but this version goes well beyond that.  For any one interested in such things, I recommend it.  I knew the story as a child and am now in myy 80s!!",1404000000,3,345,4.276923076923077
2911187,4,B000TXPXBO,"Wonderfully made movie with American and British actor A listers Oliver Reed, Charlton Heston, Rex Harrison and George C. Scott giving their usually great performances.  Raquel Welch and Felicity Dean are nice to look at.
The story is loosely based on Mark Twain's book, ""The Prince and the Pauper"" (it was released in Great Britain under that title), so, there is nothing new in the general story line.  This story has been scripted for the big screen so many times since 1915 that some viewers are bound to think, ""I've seen this before!""
It has been made for TV at least twice and once as a parody  TVseries called, ""Jake and Blake""  filmed in Buenos Aires, Argentina in English but with an all latin cast.  There is even a 24 minute Disney animated version with Mickey Mouse in the title role; and a 2004 animated Barbie version ""The Princess and the Pauper"" which went direct to video.

Through them all though, including the 1937 classic with Claude Rains and Errol Flynn, I believe this is one of the two best; the other being the 1954 version with (again, Errol Flynn) and Gina Lollobrigida.

Released in March, 1978, it was panned by critics and did not do well at the box office, presumedly as it was up against more modern blockbusters like multiple Academy Award winner ""Coming Home,"" as well as ""Gray Lady Down,"" An Unmarried Woman, ""The Big Sleep"" and Brian De Palma's ""The Fury.""  Also in the mix was Walther Matthau in ""Housecalls,"" Laurence Olivier in ""The Betsy"" and Disney's sequel ""Return From Witch Mountain.

If you like Twain, adventure, or a great line-up of actors, don't miss this one.",1393718400,6,1611,4.704626334519573
2911188,4,B000TXPXBO,"I enjoy the light side of the telling of King Edward, unfortunately he only ruled for a few years. This Light side of his short life should have been what happened to him.",1386374400,3,171,4.212121212121212
2911189,5,B000TXPXBO,"I have loved this movie since I was a kid. Oliver Reed was never better as the swashbuckling and world weary Miles Hendon. He has strong support from Charlton Heston, Ernest Borgnine, David Hemmings, and the awesome George C Scott. The weakest part was changing Prince Edward from a 10 year old to an 18 year old. It seems they only made the change to have a underdeveloped and insipid love affair for the pauper. Mark Lester as a 10 year old would have been a good choice. However, he never really seems to know what to do with the characters and he has to play two.",1382486400,2,567,4.308411214953271
2911190,5,B000TXPXBO,"Crossed Swords is a movie that follows the story line of the classic ""The Prince and the Pauper.""  This version is one of the more dramatic, old English style movies.",1369785600,4,166,4.533333333333333
2911191,5,B000TXPXBO,"I have all the versions of Prince and the Pauper.  This one is as well done as the others with its own flair.
They all are different from each other and in the totality one gets a feel for the beauty of the author.
The boys are older in this version with Mark Lester playing both sides, whereas others have twin boys
or a single boy as this version.  It is a delightful story with uplifting ending.",1363824000,5,398,4.1558441558441555
2911192,1,B000TXPXBO,"This was just terrible if you like a movie that's close to the book (The Prince and The Pauper.) Important parts were entirely changed or left out, and the ending was a farce. I have never been more disappointed in a movie that was supposed to be similar to the book.",1357948800,3,267,4.254901960784314
8211342,2,B000TXPXBO,"The DVD is fine and plays well.  Personally, I didn't like the script of the story or the casting of characters.  Mark Lester is a fine actor, but can't portray a 9 year old Tom Canty or Edward, Prince of Wales, when he is a tall 15 - 18 year old.  The script was telling a different story than the Mark Twain story.  Charlton Heston as Henry VIII wasn't beliveable.  I didn't think this film was any credit to these fine actors.",1474761600,,429,4.182926829268292
8211343,5,B000TXPXBO,"Crossed Swords was released in 1978. It starred Raquel Welch in one of her last Hollywood films. Based on Mark Twain's The Prince And The Pauper, this was an enjoyable film. I loved it when I saw it in the theatre. Fans of Raquel Welch will like this the most.",1469750400,,260,4.22
