8671285,1,B00MB2DSU4,"The Execution of Private Slovik

Private Eddie Slovik was the only Army deserter to be shot in WW II, the first since the Civil War. This TV film is a dramatization of the events. [No mention of the soldiers who were executed for murder or rape.] The red keystone patch on their shoulders identify their outfit. In reality, the firing squad had no regrets about their job, or so the books say. The beginning spends time on the details of the execution, slowing the pace. Then there are flashbacks to Slovik's past. Time in jail made him 4F, the war made jobs plentiful. Eddie tells of his bad luck and his petty thefts; he hung out with a bad crowd. A good job and a marriage changed his life for the better. But change is the only constant in this world. The need for recruits caused the draft board to revise the status of now married Eddie to 1A, and he was inducted. [Since this happened after he changed jobs could someone have arranged this in revenge? Labor was in short supply.]

Slovik got 17 weeks of basic training in Texas. He and the others will be sent to a replacement depot (""repple-depple""). Eddie is unhappy and wants a discharge. No luck; he will be shipped overseas. Under shellfire Eddie is separated from the others, and stayed with Canadian troops. Eddie loses his ammo, and his nerves cause a problem. He writes a confession and gives it to an officer. The process begins: Slovik is sentenced to be shot. Unlike many others, his sentence will be carried out. A colonel offers him a chance to get his sentence suspended if he returns to the line. Eddie refuses and makes the biggest mistake of his life. The medical report finds him healthy and sane. Slovik is found guilty, the three ballots agree on the sentence. The reviews of the sentence do not recommend clemency. His death is needed to set an example to the many other soldiers who were separated or thought of doing it. [This film ignores the Battle of the Bulge and the worries it caused.]

Most soldiers train with a unit and there is a bond between them. The replacements often had no chance to become acquainted. Stories about wartime tell of replacements whose names were unknown during their short life in battle. Experience is always important in life.

This story is slow-paced with maudlin sentiments. Its too long by 30 minutes. The team of Levinson and Link went on to create many hit shows. What was the purpose of this 1974 film? It was made just after our Vietnam War finally ended.",1407715200,,2478,4.561797752808989
