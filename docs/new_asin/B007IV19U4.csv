Incredibly, despite the high price, there is what ammounts to a five minute ad for a hotel, and other ads posing as documentary. It whisks very briefly around key sights in a breathless manner, telling you almost nothing that you might want to know. Avoid!!!",1366934400,5,354,4.546875

What made this special for me and my GF was it was London taken from a young persons fun and energetic point of view POV.",1355097600,,214,4.095238095238095
8518022,4,B007IV19U4,"Out of all of the Globe Trekker DVD's, this was my favorite. It featured appearances from Jonathan Atherton, Megan McCormick, Brianna Barnes, Estelle Bingham, Kate ""KT"" Comer, and Katy Haswell. Estelle, Kate, and Katy are all from the UK.

In the first episode, Jonathan and Megan explore London. Megan checked out the London Eye while Jonathan checked out the British Museum. He talked about the controversy over the fact that the museum has quite a few Greek antiquities and that Greece want them back, but had they not been stored in the museum, they wouldn't be preserved in the condition they are in. Jonathan later headed to a Hindu temple. They made the obligatory Globe Trekker stop at a gay nightclub (that didn't last too long). Megan stopped by the popular Notting Hill Carnival, a two day celebration of West Indian culture in London. It's held every Bank Holiday (some time in August).

In the second episode, the attractive Brianna Barnes lead a tour of London that started at Buckingham Palace with the Changing of the Guards ceremony. After having a traditional English breakfast at The Ritz hotel, she headed to the London Transport Museum, the largest urban transport museum in the world. From there, she took a vintage double decker bus and then rode a bike to the Olympic Stadium. The next day, she took a day trip to Oxford. She went to this site where they filmed a Harry Potter movie. The next day, she enjoyed drinks and artwork at the Tate Modern, a former power plant converted into an art gallery. The episode concluded with a visit to the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and the Thames Festival.

The DVD also contained some mini-episodes. In one mini-episode Estelle Bingham went on a shopping trip to downtown London. She visited the iconic Harrods. I enjoyed that. In another episode, Kate walked around the St. Pancras rail terminal. It was decent.

Katy Haswell, who is basically a female Rick Steves, leads two historic tours of downtown London. In the first tour, she starts at Harrods and then stops at the Natural History Museum where she talked about Darwin. Her next stop was the Victoria and Albert Museum. She walked behind the museum to Prince's Gate Mews, a private art gallery. Next was the Science Museum. She discussed the innovations that powered the British empire. She concluded with stops at the Royal Albert Hall and the Albert Memorial.

In Katy's second historic walk, she started at Trafalgar Square, named in honor of famous British naval victory. She stopped by 10 Downing Street, the residence of the British Prime Minister. Next, she visited the Cabinet War Room where Winston Churchill and the allies strategized during World War II. She passed by the Houses of Parliament before stopping by Westminster Abbey. She concluded at the London Eye.

Overall, this is an interesting DVD. It went off on a tangent a few times and some of the photography is grainy, but this is probably the most comprehensive guide to London there is (even more comprehensive than Rick Steves).",1348358400,6,3026,4.866019417475728
