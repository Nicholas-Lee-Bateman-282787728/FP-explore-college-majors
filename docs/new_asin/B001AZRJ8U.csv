8280774,1,B001AZRJ8U,"How do you create a video documentary of a legendary country music star and not include her music?  Seriously.  You don't hear her sing any songs.  On this DVD you get maybe a 30 minute overview of Patsy's career, NO videos of her performances and NO records of her songs.  The title is very misleading.  It leads one to believe the video is soley about Patsy Cline.  It's a shame the creators used her name to market this poorly created ""documentary"".",1228089600,3,452,4.518518518518518
8280775,1,B001AZRJ8U,I was highly disappointed with this collection. Picture quailty very bad and no film footage to speak of- just a quick re-hash of Patsys life - mostly old black and white photos. wish I did not purchase this mess - Patsy deserves a better tribute. About 30 minutes or so long.........,1224806400,3,284,4.588235294117647
8280776,4,B001AZRJ8U,"Wonderful story, but can someone please fix the description?

Patsy was not from Appalachia- she was from The Shenandoah Valley of VIRGINIA. She was not from West Virginia.

Please fix!",1218672000,,185,5.133333333333334
