5670894,5,B00BSXIH6C,"For the skeptics that says ""Show, don't just tell"" this conference is for you because that's exactly what L.A. Marzulli and Russ Dizdar do with everything I'm about to describe here.

These two blessed ministers in the Lord come together as a wonderful complement and ""tag team"" of each other in a very thorough, well constructed, and easy to follow conference that covers a wider range of subjects and how they're all interconnected then you might suspect.

For those who wants feel good, ear tickling, warm and fuzzy messages I recommend looking elsewhere.

If you're someone who wants to be challenged, edified, and cares about knowing the truth no matter how uncomfortable it may make you at first, step right up.

The book of Genesis and specifically Genesis 6 describes a world changing event that many people and far too many in the Church know very little about. The Nephilim or Giants depending which Bible translation you're looking at.  The original Hebrew being B'Nai Elohim which translates into English  as Sons of God.

This exact wording shows up in two specific places in the Old Testament. In the book of Job during all of the heavenly scenes, the angels are referred to as Sons of God/B'Nai Elohim and in Genesis 6:4.

The Sons of Seth/Daughters of Cain teaching originated from Augustine and simply can't account for this right off the bat.  The New Testament confirms this in Jude 1:6 with the mysterious and often overlooked passage: ""6 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.""

What does this mean? Why should we care about it now in today's society?

Because in Matthew 24:37 Jesus Himself described the time leading up to His Second Coming as being specifically ""like the days of Noah.""  He could have named any number of Old Testament luminaries but he choose Noah. Why? What was so distinct about Noah's time period vs any other?  The answer is in Genesis 6 and Judges 1:6.

There are credible historical accounts that conveniently get lost or buried typically by governments or institutions like the Smithsonian that there were giants all over the world and in the United States. I'm not talking about run of the mill giants like Shaq or the late Andre the Giant. We're talking 9 feet minimum with two rows of teeth and six fingers and six digits. Not normal!

In the Old Testament, Goliath and his brothers and Og of Bashan were both giants. Og slept in a bed that 13 feet long and 6 feet wide but where is the proof?

This conference was assembled in Fall of 2012 with the express purpose of providing that proof and answering many other difficult and complicated issues related.  Two long time ministry veterans and lead researchers in these areas, Pastor Russ Dizdar and L.A Marzulli, teamed up to host this conference in Newark Ohio. Why Newark? Because Newark contains compelling evidence of these same types of Giants being right here in the good ole USA at some point in the past.

The Serpent Mound in Newark, Ohio is nearly 1350 feet long and has a pattern and outline that can only be fully appreciated from the air. Sound familiar? Crop circles anyone? Intricate designs that can be fully be appreciated from the air? Same source. Again: Shown, not just told and how these sorts of things were warned about in the Scriptures.

There is heavy debate as to the origins of this Mound and LA and Russ present very compelling evidence that cast serious doubts on conventional construction for the Serpent Mound and how there are a number of key similarities between the Serpent Mound and other strange architecture all throughout the Ohio Valley. From there the subject expands to more obvious and prominent examples of architecture around the world that defy conventional construction explanations such as the Egyptian Pyramids, the Ruins of Baalbek, and of course, Stonehenge.  There are certain similarities to all of them.

Some newspaper accounts have been preserved that prove that archaeological digs occurred in the past that proved beyond any doubt that these giants were real and lived in the United States and other parts of the world. These accounts are shown during the course of the conference and it's difficult to imagine even the most jaded of skeptics dismissing them and how they would it while staying intellectually honest.

It would appear that a conspiracy exists to keep this information from the public and especially in the United States. Why?  The easy answer is because this is more concrete proof that the Bible is correct and evolution absolutely cannot answer or account for the existence of these giants and especially in the distant past.  These giants destroy evolution in two seconds.

Marzulli and Dizdar present proof that no less than Presidents Washington and Lincoln themselves knew about these giants.

Augustine introduced a number of concepts into the Church that I won't debate here and one of those concepts was Sons of Seth/Daughters of Cain as the answer for Genesis 6. Both LA and Russ go into detail with Scriptures that thoroughly refute and debunk that concept. It simply doesn't hold water.

As far back as nearly 2,000 years ago the famous historian Josephus wrote:  ""For many angels of God accompanied with women, and begot sons that proved unjust, and despisers of all that was good, on account of the confidence they had in their own strength; for the tradition is, that these men did what resembled the acts of those whom the Grecians called giants or Titans. (Josephus Ant. 1.3.1)""

Josephus also spoke of the ancient biblical Amorites that lived around Hebron. ""In Hebron there were still then left the race of giants, who had bodies so large, and countenances so entirely different from other men, that they were surprising to the sight and terrible to the hearing. The bones of these men are still shown to this very day. (Josephus Ant. 5.2.3)

Was he making all that up? Of course not.  No one has ever disputed and refuted those accounts.

This is missing history not just for America but for the entire planet.

As I wrote at the beginning of this review: This conference is for the skeptics. Marzulli and Dizdar don't just tell. They show. You will see clear footage and pictures of very questionable skulls from down in South America that aren't easy explained by the known and deliberate artificial cranial methods ancient societies like the Mayans employed. That begs more questions: Where did they get that idea from? Why did they even do it? What inspired the concept?

It isn't just the size of the skulls but other details that stand out like massive eye sockets, huge indented jaws and skull plates that are not human in terms of the structure and how they connect. I would be interested to know what the skeptic's answers for these things would be after viewing this material.  It's not space aliens, either.

At another point in one of presentations, L.A.  shows footage out of Baalbek and explains in detail with the footage how people try to explain how this structure was built and how those stories simply don't hold water.  They can't build this thing conventionally now if they wanted to so how in the world would normal men have done it way back? The same goes for the Great Pyramid and some other architecture on the planet. Again, this is shown not just told.

Russ's messages focused more on how these concepts apply to today and are connected with Satanic Ritual Abuse and the fallout from it.  He explains what  a ""Satanic Super Soldier""  is and how these will ultimately fulfill Revelation 19:19 and how we're seeing the groundwork laid down for that now which is more proof we're living in the days of Noah as Jesus said it would be in the time before His return.  He shows with Scripture how all that mess leads right back to Genesis 6 and how it all fits in to Matthew 24:37.

There's so much compelling and cutting edge material in this conference that I really don't feel like my description here has done it much  justice. It all weaves together like a tapestry and you'll come away with a complete picture.

The asking price is generous for this. 420 minutes of material that flies by and is hard to walk away from.

Some people ask: What does this have to do with the Gospel? It's a fair question and ultimately that's what LA and Russ are all about.  There's never a time where they present material where the Gospel is not at the forefront of everything being discussed. This material simply shows even more verifiable and concrete proof that Bible can be trusted and taken literally and it ultimately leads back to God's love for us and the great lengths He went to, to offer us the gift of salvation and redemption through Jesus Christ.

Everything is rooted in the Gospel and everything leads back to the Gospel.

You'll come away from all of this edified, alert, aware, and ultimately encouraged because you will have no doubts that Jesus is coming back soon and He's ultimately in full control and can never be surprised.

I can guarantee you that you will be looking at things differently after watching this. The worse case scenario might be: You won't agree with any of it but it'll make you ask tough questions from there on out. Good! Matthew 7:7 says ""Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you."" Be an honest truth seeker. Ask the tough questions.

The encouragement from this may seem hard to believe going by some of the dark and weighty subject matter covered here.

LA and Russ both are gifted speakers that know how to not bury people in the darkness and take people through the Scriptures to remind everyone of the Lord's plans and promises and what this all means from the big picture standpoint.  They both have the gift of being able to present tough subject matter without talking ""at"" people and are even able to inject warmth and humor at appropriate times. They're both wonderful ministers and men of God.

I hear through the grapevine that this conference was such a smashing success that they'll very likely do a second one in Fall of 2013 that will be expanded in every sense of the word. I can't wait to see that.

I can't recommend this conference set highly enough.  Much appreciation and thanks to everyone involved in making this much needed conference a reality.",1363996800,38,10413,4.747502774694784
8573429,3,B00BSXIH6C,not very much about the nephilims. the talks were pretty ordinary preaching  about what the un-clean spirits are like and doing and etc. I believe the nephilims were and are fallen angels ; not ufo aliens. I wanted to learn more about these nephilims. 90% of these talks are just ordinary preaching about the demons.,1454544000,,316,4.745454545454545

8573431,5,B00BSXIH6C,"When viewed from a biblical standpoint this series begins to help the missing pieces fall into
place.  So much is left unsaid in text that the true picture is left muddled indefinitely until
someone with both a love of scripture and a burning inquiring mind turn the pieces to fit.  That
occurs with this set and pretty much any of Mazulli's writing or DVD's.",1402963200,,359,4.59375
8573432,5,B00BSXIH6C,I've been listening and watching these dvd's several times.  I enjoy them but also they make me think and realize things that have happened in the past.  Marzulli makes it all come together.,1392940800,3,190,4.7272727272727275
8573433,2,B00BSXIH6C,"Had hoped this would be informative but Marzulli talks way too fast and seems to jump all over the place instead of staying on track . Hate to say it but it was hard to follow and I did not learn anything I didn't already know .  Also , there was no mention of the mounds.  Wish I could give it a better review but to be honest these videos left me frustrated .",1372032000,3,361,3.864864864864865

8573437,4,B00BSXIH6C,I purchased this dvd series because I have been in search of information concerning the falling angels and the nephilim. I am impressed with the information concerning the Mayans and human sacrificing. Its a must have for Bible readers who are looking for the hiding agenda of Satan in modern times as well.,1368316800,7,307,4.811320754716981
8573438,1,B00BSXIH6C,"I purchased this thinking a discussion about the mounds Ohio Valley would be featured....

After watching the dvds I feel deceived.  The dvds consist of the same talk you can find on you-tube of Russ and LA.  The same concepts they discuss on every podcast and radio show they appear on is reiterated on these dvds.  The mounds are mentioned very few times.

The only way I could recommend these videos is if you have never heard either one of these men speak or if you want a hard copy of all their concepts in one place.  Chances are, you wouldn't think of purchasing these dvds if you haven't already heard them.

Everything on these dvds has been repeated over and over by these men on pod casts and radio shows for the last 5 years.  These dvds do not provide any new information concerning the details, research or archeology of the mounds of Ohio.",1366848000,18,854,4.464516129032258
