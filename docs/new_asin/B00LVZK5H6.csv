I loved Guillermo Francella from ""Rudo y Cursi"" and an Argentinian TV series in which  he co-stars, ""The Man of Your Dreams"". The plot centers around two accountants who are best buddies who have the same routine every day. One day, one man disappears. The movie becomes a detective story with Francella as the detective. The ending is a delightful surprise.",1522972800,,475,4.459770114942529

8668442,5,B00LVZK5H6,"Superb casting, directing, writing.

LOVE the leads and the Armenian. Everything. I may not be a detailed movie reviewer but I have watched many films and this is sublime and wonderful. This is an experience and transcendental at the same time. As the film ended and it is a perfect ending, a perfect shot there is a sense of complete and grateful satisfaction.

There is a stylization to this film, the choreographed story telling that is trending now, that is slick and lighthearted. It may annoy some as it is more music video than film.",1423958400,,540,4.673684210526316

8668444,4,B00LVZK5H6,"This lightweight comedy from Argentina was the Highest Grossing Romantic Comedy in Argentina in 2014. It is charming and kept my attention throughout the 92 minutes running time  waiting to see how it ends. The plot is clever and simple. Two mend become such good friends that they travel together, lust over the same woman while on vacation and then become partners in an appliance store. They litter do everything together  including driving to work at the same time with their cars aligned in two lanes and eating the exact same thing for breakfast! The opening scenes are cleverly done. One of the men is married and the other is single. One day the married man doesnt show up for work and his wife (who is attractive, I might add) has no idea where he went. But she shows up at the store to replace her husband as the partner in the firm. After some infighting (not much) the wife and the single partner head off to look for the lost husband. How it ends I will not reveal as that is the purpose of the film  to have you guess.

The subtitles in English are clear and easy to read except that there is a lot of fast dialogue in the film. I found myself periodically hitting the Pause button to read what was being said. Im giving the film four stars because I liked it but, might take off a half star for issue with reading the subtitles. (Not the fault of the distributor  Strand Releasing  though. The film was intended for the Argentinian audience who don't require the subtitles.

There are no bonus features on the DVD.

If you like light relationship comedies you may enjoy this. I did.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
