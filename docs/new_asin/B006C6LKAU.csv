4983430,2,B006C6LKAU,"To begin with, this series focuses too much on the history of the featured forces. And unless u are one who wants to know how these forces came about, u will be thoroughly bored! i certainly expected alot more coverage on modern time ops, weaponry, training and selection etc...generally a disappointment!",1376092800,2,305,5.0
4983431,3,B006C6LKAU,"Special Forces: War in the Shadows is a strange DVD set.  The listed run time is almost 11 and 1/2 hours over five DVDs, but it's a case in point about how one should go for 'quality over quantity'. It's a mix of vintage black and white/color film footage and relatively recent video, with awful synthesized music throughout.  In all fairness, music isn't a big priority when it comes to military specials, but I just can't seem to escape the all-out Casio keyboard assault with these old Discovery Channel-type shows.  Overall I think if you're a military buff like myself, you'll come out feeling you got a bargain with this set.  At the same time, this set will remind you of the bargain bin at Wally World.  Read on to find out why.

At the current price I couldn't resist buying this, so allow me to say that my 3-star rating is meant to be a good thing.  In comparison, a show like '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Surviving-The-Cut/dp/B004WI10YQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Surviving The Cut</a>' would be a five-star show for me.  The advantage of a show like Surviving the Cut was unprecedented access and the ability to follow the roster of an entire class throughout different training phases.  The makers of this series however, had to rely on old file footage (granted, they go way back in history to as early as WWI), while at the same time they've interspersed cool footage of unusual events like a brief scene involving a SEAL team launching a Zodiac off of the port side sail plane of a submarine.  It's this constant mix of the old and new that makes for a slightly better-than-average collection.

One of the problems with SF War in the Shadows is the perceived need for constant narration. Again, since the discs are comprised almost entirely of file footage, it can't be helped.  This leads to almost non-stop voice over scripts that aren't exactly accurate. SEALS were described as receiving airborne training from the 82nd Airborne (Fort Bragg, NC), when in reality they go to jump school at Fort Benning, Georgia, home of the Airborne school and Infantry. The series also glossed over certain details about the French Foreign Legion (disc one), such as the entirety of their basic training.  I've read some books about the legion, and it's obvious that everyone is required to learn french.  Their teaching method involves a steady regimen of negative reinforcement such as beatings and other unpleasant things, and the disc completely ignores that detail.  You would think that for being so lengthy, the producers would have included some more facts, but again, this is a bargain bin collection.

I would have to say that at the current price, yes, this is worth it, but you get what you pay for.  If you want to see old black & white footage then you won't be disappointed.  The collection contains hours of historical war footage from the 50's, 60's and 70's that I've never seen before.  If you want to see more recent stuff, you might be disappointed, although it does contain some footage of SAS selection, which is kind of rare.  And if you wanted to hear some really bad music, well you're in for a treat.

Some final notes:

The discs are packaged on one spindle.  It's a great way to ship blank DVDs but a bad way to box a collection.  Mine arrived perfect though.  It also appears that none of the discs have closed captioning.  No biggie.",1335744000,15,3411,4.81786941580756
