8111591,4,B000ENC6WI,"When we saw the last half on television, we could not believe that Ron Jeremy was the star.  It was a good B rate movie.  Tried another dvd with Ron Jeremy and I warn you - DON""T.",1502755200,,179,3.810810810810811
8111592,5,B000ENC6WI,"The DVD box cover is misleading and I thought I was picking up a serious indy horror film. I guess they did that to attract serious horror fans knowing that once they started watching this movie they couldn't stop. The dude that put together the box cover needs to be given a bonus. He moved at least one disc.

This is a really well made Horror Comedy with quality actors and a great pace. I didn't even know that Ron Jeremy was in this film. If I would have known that I wouldn't have given it a chance and most likely, wouldn't have bought it. A ""Hollywood Video"" store in Cookeville, Tennessee had a going out of business sale and DVDs were ten for $15 so I took a quick look at it and grabbed it just so I could have ten-movies.

Jeremy actually does a pretty good job as ""Andre the Butcher"" and he plays a non-speaking character. Jeremy should play more of those.

This movie is a must see for any current or former cheerleader. It's the young folks car breaks down horror storyline with a humorous twist. Four junior college kids, three-girls and a guy, all cheerleaders going to a cheerleading competition. Two really good looking cheerleaders and one fat cheerleader who really likes to eat! She's not really fat by normal person standards but anything over 110 lbs is fat to a cheerleader. In one scene, Andre the Butcher baits her by hanging a donut on a string in a tree!

Despite Ron Jeremy being in this movie there is no graphic sex and only a couple of flashes of nudity and that was done by a ""boob double"". If you watch this movie once you might think that it was ""sexually charged"" but in reality there is almost no nudity. Kind of like a lot of people think ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" was a bloody movie. It wasn't.

You can really get into the characters in this movie. Cheerleaders are in full uniform for the entire movie. A ""Dukes of Hazzard"" Uncle Jesse narrator look-a-like is used, but not overused, to add some great humor. Simple storyline and great fun!",1279756800,,1986,4.4301369863013695
8111593,5,B000ENC6WI,"I've discovered over time that anything Ron Jeremy is involved with, though it may not be life changing or intended to be thought provoking, really does have a certain coolness factor that can't be ignored. This film is a lot of fun and is very tongue-in-cheek in the way it portrays the low-budget horror genre. The ""rough around the edges"" look and feel of the film gives it a certain charm that most high-budget ""studio"" films can't pull off.

Besides Ron Jeremy the cast also includes Maury Sterling, who has quite an impressive list of credits on IMDB ranging from television shows such as Angel, CSI, Nip/Tuck, Charmed, Monk, ER and 24, to films such as Smokin' Aces and Beverly Hills Chihuahua.

Also starring as the lead in the film is newcomer April Billingsley. This talented newcomer has some excellent acting chops and judging by her reels and blogs easily found on YouTube it is apparent that she'll have quite an impressive list of credits in her repertoire soon as well. Check out her website at aprilbillingsley.com and see for yourself what she has to offer.

Overall, if you're not looking for a state-of-the-art, edge-of-your-seat type of horror film and are instead more interested in a campy, Troma influenced, fun popcorn movie you really can't go wrong with this one. Good, not so clean and wholesome fun for all!",1224288000,,1336,4.82532751091703
8111594,1,B000ENC6WI,"Ron Jeremy did play a decent villian in this film, looks like he played a mix between Leatherface and the killer in the Prowler. The movie never takes itself seriously and I just didn't like it any part of it. I didn't really laugh at any jokes, but im sure some people would. I don't know who would enjoy this film but someone out there has too.

Ron Jeremy is better in Terror Firmer. If you want to see him at his comic best watch Toxie Avenger 4: Citzen Toxie. Dont waste money on this cheap effort to be a Troma film.",1188777600,,522,4.117647058823529
8111595,4,B000ENC6WI,"this is one of those movies that is great to watch with a bunch of friends on a huge tv and just laugh!

it has ron jeremy as the main murder which you will see in the middle of the movie and it has black metal as the back ground music all through the movie which is just great! it makes the atmosphere of the movie more intense it has a few jumpy parts but its basically a horror comedy. gets kind of raunchy in the middle but still worth the money if you want a horror comedy movie!",1172793600,4,484,3.888888888888889
8111596,2,B000ENC6WI,"first off, i had no idea ron jeremy (aka a huge male porn star) was the main character!!! i don't know how i missed that, and didn't recognize him until the credits rolled. that was a surprise, ok, now that that's out of the way, on with the review....

the movie was OKAY. low budget, and not very original. not the lowest, dumbest movie i ever saw, but it definently will never be in my top 10 favorites. the plot is very dry and predictable. there were ALOT of sex scenes and references to things sexual. but remember, ron jeremy was in the movie. if i would've known he was in the movie i wouldn't have watched it. anyway, lots of sexual stuff. this was kind of a comedical horror movie. however, not scary at all, not very funny either.

PROS

some parts were funny (as in stupid)

CONS

low budget (however this was probably intended), overused sex scenes, short, same plot as used over and over again, not graphic at all in the murder scenes.

OVERALL

i AM as a matter of fact a big fan of low budget no name movies. this one was okay. not the greatest low budget movie i've ever seen. it was pretty dry and uneventful, if you're a fan of ron jeremy, buy or rent it, if not, don't waste your time, just go get another low budget slasher movie.",1164412800,,1251,4.253164556962025
8111597,3,B000ENC6WI,"this was pretty much a direct copy of those movies except with a lot more comic relief to cut the tention. some parts of this movie border on softcore porn and there are plenty of scenes that if you have a sick sense of humor will leave you laughing. i just cannot believe they actually gave the king of 80's porn a lead role in a horror movie.

this had to be strickly a comedy. a mockery of all those old horror movie cliches that just made you shake your head at the thought the directors, writers and actors actually took time to make them. the special effects are horrible. in the opening scene a convict gets shot by a shotgun in the leg, but there is no blood until a later cut scene.

overall, this movie was terrible, probably intentionally. i got my entertainment out of it though. if anything, watch this so you will have something stupid to talk about to some of your friends.",1154995200,,888,4.311377245508982
8111598,4,B000ENC6WI,"not sure why all these bad reviews, those people obviously didn't get it. The film does not take itself too seriously.

The movie was very funny, and the plot kept me interested all the way through and I also enjoyed the narrator in the movie , who kind of reminded me of ""uncle jesse"" from dukes of hazzard. The film also had a good message in the end, which you don't often find in today's horror films. See it today...if you don't see this it will be a sin!",1152835200,3,460,4.168539325842697
8111599,1,B000ENC6WI,"Ok, So I thought, what the heck I will give it a shot....I love horror films, even B-rated ones, but I must say....THIS WAS HORRIBLE.  What a waste of time.  The guy who produced this junk needs to seriously think about getting a new job.  My 17 year old son has made movies better than this one.  Nothing cleaver or original here.  No surprises.  Plot was horrible. The lines were so predictable. C'mon.  Acting was REALLY Bad. Screenwriting obviously is a challenge for the producer, writer, etc. There was nothing that suggested it should have ever been released. I feel sorry for all the actors in this film and I would suggest that they leave this one off their resume's. Of course with Ron Jeremy in the film, what could one expect?  What a joke..or maybe thats what it was supposed to be. I hated this film and thought that I could have better spent my time chopping up a turkey...a jive turkey.  Perhaps then I might have been entertained.  Don't waste your money people.",1149638400,2,979,4.542857142857143
8111600,1,B000ENC6WI,"Ron Jeremy running around killing people, need I say more? Obviously, I knew this movie was going to be horrible, but I think it was one of those B rated movies where the plot was suppose to be funny. This movie is worth watching but only for some laughs.

Overall, the fight scene between the two cheerleader teams and the childish vocabulary were the best parts in this movie, in my opinion.",1148860800,2,393,4.458333333333333
