597586,5,6303219136,this is a b movie but is awesome. It is a lot like seinfeld the way the crapiest stuff happens to him and it seems every things going wrong for him. I would spend $20 on this movie I don't know if I would spend much more. Jim Carrey plays a very small role in this as the devil,1079913600,2,277,3.711864406779661
597587,5,6303219136,"I won't lie to you, when I rented this movie not knowing who Steve Oedekerk was, I wanted to see Jim Carrey. But I quickly realized that he didn't even need to be in the movie. I laughed so hard and long that the tears from my eyes dripped down my face onto my shirt and made it so wet I had to change. I swear to god. I laughed harder at this movie then at any movie in my life. I had to pause it many a time to catch my breath and be able to hear it over my hysterics. I lost 300lbs while watching this movie and got a six pack washboard stomach in 90 minutes. Well, I guess that's not true. But I did nearly laugh myself into dehydration from all the tears coming out of my eyes. Seriously, if you like INSANE sarcasm and stand-up with appropriate visuals GET THIS FILM. Screw it, BUY THIS FILM ANYWAYS!!! God will strike you dead if you don't JUMP at the chance to get this for anything under a small fortune. I would pay $100 or more for this....on VHS!!!! Seriously....GET IT USED HERE, OR AT EBAY OR HALF.COM. Do it......now......go.....

597588,5,6303219136,"Carrey has only a small role in this film but that doesn't matter because Oedekerk provides an outstanding comic performance that does not depend on simply being zany. There is a real comic intelligence at work here. I particularly liked his design for a card to send to a child when their grandma died which featured a pop up coffin and a recording of a funeral march. Sick, but in the context of this film, totally hilarious.",1060992000,3,427,4.558441558441558
597589,5,6303219136,"This movie combined inventive camerawork, with excellent acting, and comedic imagination.  This movie should be on DVD...what do i have to do to get an official DVD copy!?!",1040083200,5,172,5.142857142857143
597590,5,6303219136,"This movie is like Sienfeld; the topics are useless but funny.  Thane Furrows, the main character, complains about loud music, cereal, telemarketers, insurance salesmen, Happy the Clam, and basically everything else, too.  After all, how can a pre-recorded message be friendly, even by calling him ""T. Furrows?""  His response is ""My name is Winky, the magic dog-mule-hare catcher.""  About the only time he ever leaves his apartment is when Death comes for him (Jim Carrey's tiny role) and then decides he's too annoying to take.  Still, you'll fall over laughing.",1000339200,5,563,5.211111111111111
597591,5,6303219136,"High Srung stars Steve Odekirk -- sorry about the spelling.  It's basically this guy, Thame Furrows, sitting in his apartment complaining all day.  Topics include... everything!  Don't expect to see a lot of Jim Carrey in the movie, his role is small.",995414400,3,251,4.928571428571429

7841110,3,6303219136,Bought it to watch the small role that has Jani Lane in it. Skip through most of it.,1463270400,,84,3.7222222222222223
7841111,5,6303219136,This is one of the most underrated comedies of the 90s. I still laugh after a hundred or more viewings.,1386892800,,103,4.2
7841112,5,6303219136,"I love this movie. I used to rent it all the time from the video store, I was disappointed when I didn't see it on DVD anywhere though. But I bought it for VHS because it is that awesome of a movie!!",1355011200,,199,3.761904761904762
7841113,3,6303219136,"Pretty decent movie.  It has its funny moments and there are a few overdrawn rants, but it is all part of the plot.  There are a number of recognizable actors, and the one that comes to mind is the late singer, Jani Lane.  This movie won't be everyones cup of tea, but is somewhat similar to say Seinfeld as in complaining about ordinary life.",1325203200,,343,4.328125
7841114,3,6303219136,"Boy o boy, five stars from most everyone here, I'm excited...a rare lost gem!

Oooops. I love the concept---dump the fourth wall from moment one and rant for 90 minutes at the viewer---but it hinges on genius writing, and that is sadly nowhere in evidence here. This is basically an angry stand-up comedian type idea, Lewis Black or much better Bill Hicks going off non-stop while stalking their apartment. But Oedekerk is no Hicks, or even very funny after a while. His whining gets old fast, especially as all the bits are really hacky stand-up, nothing too earth-shaking or new. And the irony of this whiner whining about whiners is just too much. Or not enough.

The mean boss is kind of funny and there's some decent interplay with his pal, and the death joke is good, but I wish I'd had the sort of comedy nirvana others here seem to have enjoyed. I kept on trying to like it, but after a while I just kept thinking, ""Stand up routine in a living room, and not a great routine at that"". Even Carrey's role was too little, too late. Now if he had been the lead...

Maybe I'm way off, and I just missed the genius. But as someone who loves both comedies and stand-up, I think this is a half-assed version of both.",1322524800,,1217,4.4
7841115,5,6303219136,"Allthough alot of people would disagree I think this is one of the greatest comedies ever. Best dark humour movie by far. So much of this movie has been relevant in my life at one time or another from the fear of flies, failure and resturants to the anoying neighbor upstairs to the smoking boss you can't stand to the despising of door to door salesmen and automated telmarketers. This is OCD at its finest. I must've rented this movie 10 times within the first year it was in the store. Was happy to find it for sale. Now if only they would put it on DVD....",1307577600,,560,4.242990654205608
7841116,5,6303219136,"Steve Oedekerk has created one of the best comedies of our time.  You'd think that a show about a guy sitting in his room complaining for over an hour would get tedious, but it never does.  If you haven't seen this, you owe it to yourself to find a copy of this and watch it.  It's absolutely hilarious!
Why in the world can't we get this on DVD?  On Steve Oedekerk's web site he had continually stated that it was in the works, but that was a few years ago.
Please, Email Steve and tell him you want it on DVD!  Amazon execs, please call his people and tell him that people want it!  We NEED this on DVD.  It's not a want, it's a NEED.  Life will not be complete until that happens.",1222732800,,683,4.044776119402985
7841117,5,6303219136,"I saw this movie when i served in The Norwegian Artillery in 1995. We were posted in the Norwegian mountains, and to entertain ourselves me and my platoon buddies drove three norwegian miles down to the nearest ""town"" where we rented ""High Strung"" and some other crap Hollywood comedy.

This is by far one of the funniest movies I`ve ever seen.

I sat in the empty gym hall after my comrades had seen enough, I wanted to see it again. They didn`t like it, but I almost laughed my ass off. It`s all about the human condition.

Honest, complex and uncompromising. My favourite line:

7841118,5,6303219136,"this is without a doubt the greatest movie ever.  it is genius.  pure undiluted genius.  everything in my life is so much better just because this movie exists.  when i saw that they had it on amazon dot com i almost peed my pants with excitement.  i first saw this movie when i was 13 and years later i am still OBSESSED with it.  whenever someone asks me what my favorite movie is, i automatically say high strung even if i havnet thought about the movie for a long time.  whenever I eat cereal i think fondly of too much cereal milk.  and when i was in california last summer i saw a watermelon popsicle with seeds and almost had a stroke.  if you haven't seen this movie, you are not complete as a person.  buy it now.  I am going to.  I'm actually about to cry I can't believe I'm buying high strung.  HIGH STRUNG = GREATEST MOVIE EVER.  so put that in your pipe and smoke it.

ps to the person that gave high strung a bad review...you should probably reconsider your reasons for being alive.  just a suggestion.",1110758400,13,1017,4.2460732984293195
