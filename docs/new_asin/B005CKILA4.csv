4653600,4,B005CKILA4,"For many, many years I have heard about Rogers' Rangers.  I first heard about them when I saw the old Spencer Tracy movie ""Northwest Passage.""
This video was by A&E, and is a well-produced & made historical film about the ""real thing.""  I found it quite enlightening, and I both enjoyed it and learned quite a bit.
Rogers & his Rangers fought in several battles of the ""7 Years War"" in North America, between the French and the English (Known here as the ""French & Indian War."")  This is about their role in that war.
The only disappointment was that it is only about half an hour long.  (I liked it enough to wish it were tweice as long.)",1389830400,,639,4.34453781512605
4653601,5,B005CKILA4,Very informative segment. The references (journals and logs) used do a great job to support the perspective. The scenery is good and cinematography is much better in this segment than some of the others in this series (modern). My biggest regret is that it in no way long enough to do real justice.,1372982400,,298,4.6415094339622645

8465553,4,B005CKILA4,"This is as accurate portrayal of Robert Rogers career as we're likely to get. Sadly, as is the way with legends, his life has been the subject of dubious story telling, such as in the 1940 film, Northwest Passage with Spencer Tracy as Rogers and, recently, with Angus Macfadyen as a twisted sociopath Rogers in the AMC television series Turn. Both actors do a wonderful job of playing an interesting character. That character, however, is not Robert Rogers.

Peter Coyote does a wonderful job, as always, narrating this short documentary. He and Keith David could likely entertain us for hours simply by reading a phone book ;)",1435276800,,627,4.859813084112149
