8392874,1,B003A7ZU2I,"I bought the series one video a couple of years ago, which plays in the U.S. format, and I LOVED the shows. I've been waiting for subsequent years to be available, but still not yet, and I'm wondering why they haven't been put into U.S. format.  How hard could that be?  Why would they do the first year's shows but nothing after that???",1328745600,2,337,4.333333333333333
8392875,5,B003A7ZU2I,I enjoy this series so much I had to buy a multi-region player and then order it from Amazon in the United Kingdom.  If they release Series 2-4 to the United States I will buy it again so I can play on all my televisions.  I have traveled to South Africa and this series helps me re-live my trip and enjoy great family entertainment at the same time.  I hope it lasts forever.,1270425600,9,376,4.123287671232877
