8316619,3,B0013MX0CE,"This is a nice archival interview with Michael Price at the Goodspeed Opera House in 1977 after ""Annie"" had just won the Tony Award for Best Musical. The interview only lasts about 15 minutes, so this is a little pricey for what you are getting, but if you are a fan of the Goodspeed Opera House, you may enjoy it. The show they are working on is Jerome Kern's ""Sweet Adeline"" and you see clips of the rehearsal and a little of the performance as well as backstage discussions between Michael Price and the choreographer Dan Siretta. Unfortuntely, there are no clips of ""Annie"", but you do see Michael Price's passion for theatre and why the Goodspeed Opera house has been a fixture in East Haddam, CT for so long. This is really for the true old-style musical theatre fans.",1204502400,,774,4.535714285714286
