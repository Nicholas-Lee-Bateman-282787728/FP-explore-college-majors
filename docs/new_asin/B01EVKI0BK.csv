7740818,5,B01EVKI0BK,"This is a well crafted movie, with an excellent cast and intelligent direction by Susanna White, complemented by a good score by Marcelo Zarvos.

The film's style reminded me of Martin Ritt's ""The Spy who came in from the Cold"" (another Le Carre adaptation) and Sidney J Furie's ""The Ipcress File"", in creating a sense of intrigue, while maintaining a contemporary feel.

Then, Ewan McGregor's Perry and Naomi Harris's Gail make a couple reminiscent of the innocent couple in Hitchcock's ""The Man who knew too much""- drawn into a maelstrom of violence and intrigue.

The story on one level is straightforward and contemporary- an informant on the Russian Mafia wants out, and grasps for someone to help. Given the Le Carre treatment, it becomes an absorbing story of intrigue, suspense and double cross.

This film does feature some strong violence,nudity and coarse language- which is within the context of the story.

If you enjoy the genre, I expect you will find this a satisfying entertainment.",1468281600,7,999,5.03030303030303
7740819,4,B01EVKI0BK,"I wonder whether it's possible to make a bad John le Carr movie: Every one of the 15 films and miniseries based on his espionage thrillers is well worth watching.

There are the masterpieces, including Martin Ritt's The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1965) and the BBC's 1979 miniseries, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.

But even the weakest films - the 1984 terrorism romance The Little Drummer Girl and the 1990 Cold War love story The Russia House - still outstrip most spy movies.

Director Susanna White's Our Kind of Traitor, a Russian mafia bromance, is a lesser entry, but there's much to recommend.

Based on the 2010 novel, it stars Ewan McGregor as Perry Makepeace, a professor who is on holiday in Marrakech with his power-lawyer wife, Gail (Naomie Harris), when he's approached by a Russian mobster (Stellan Skarsgrd).

Skarsgrd (the father of The Legend of Tarzan's Alexander Skarsgrd) is all hand gestures and belly laughs as the gregarious, bigger-than-life bruiser Dina.

One of Russia's top money-launderers, Dina hands damning evidence about his bosses to Perry and begs him to deliver it posthaste to British intelligence. He's terrified, he tells Perry, that the new mob boss (Grigoriy Dobrygin) plans to wipe out his whole family.

McGregor is highly likable as a clueless and sheepish - if secretly sly - Hitchcockian everyman who knows he's out of his depth the second he gets sucked into the spy game.

Less palatable is Damian Lewis as Hector, an MI6 middle manager who handles Dina's case. Lewis, so wonderfully understated in Homeland, is too intense here. His character, prone to go off on extended monologues about ethics, seems to speak every third word in italics.

Le Carr's work is so effective, in part, because his stories usually feel so plausible and grounded.

Our Kind of Traitor strains credulity: The world it attempts to depict - international organized crime - is too large, too unmanageable and too easily caricatured. With its emphasis on action and exotic locales, it feels closer to Ian Fleming than Le Carr's more cerebral work.

Still, I'd take Le Carr over Fleming every time.",1467676800,9,2122,4.949295774647887
7740820,4,B01EVKI0BK,"""Our Kind of Traitor"" (2016 release from the UK; 105 min.) bring the story of Perry and Gail, a British couple. While they are vacationing in Marrakesh, Perry is invited by a Russian guy to join for drinks, Dima takes a liking to Perry and soon the two of them are playing tennis, and Perry and Gail are invited to Dima's daughter's 18th birthday, an extravagant affair. During that party, Dima makes the big reveal: he is an oligarch and money-launderer but is in trouble from a competing oligarch. Dima asks Perry to deliver a memory stick containing damning information on British politicians to MI 6, in return for safety for his family. Perry reluctantly accepts. At this point we're not even 15 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest John LeCarre book adaption for the big screen, this time directed by Susanna White, best known for her work in TV (including BBC and HBO). Also noteworthy in the opening credits: ""Presented by Amazon Prime Instant Video"" (the movie was released simultaneously in US theaters and on Amazon). I have not read the book, so I cannot comment how closely the big screen adaption follows the book. This being a very plot-heavy crime thriller, I'm going to not make any further comments about the movie's lay-out, other than to say it is done very nicely, with actual character development, in particular as to Perry and Gale. The movie features top-notch on-location photography in London, Finland (standing in for Russia), Bern (extra bonus point for the clever use of the Einstein Museum), Paris, and Marrakesh. the lead performances from  Ewan McGregor as Perry. Naomie Harris as Gail and Stellan Skarsgrd as Dima all bring thoroughly enjoyable performances (I couldn't help but think of the parallels between McGregor's character here and Gary Grant's role in North by Northwest. At one point Perry comments ""I don't want to be involved"", to which the UK cop  responds ""you're already involved!"".) Bottom line; this is a thoroughly enjoyable movie, and MILES better than the 2011 big screen adaptation of LeCarre's ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"".

""Our Kind of Traitor"" opened on 3 screens for all of Greater Cincinnati this long holiday weekend, and the Monday afternoon screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, somewhat to my (pleasant) surprise. If you are a fan of spy thrillers, and in particular of John LeCarre adaptations, you cannot go wrong with this, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Bly-ray. ""Our Kind of Traitor"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1467590400,5,2674,4.90929203539823
7740821,5,B01EVKI0BK,"John LeCarre's novel adapted to movie is once more a sure winner. It reflects the current day nexus between terrorism, international crime, intelligence  and  politics. Although this connections present a bleak view of political bureaucracy, international finance and politics, it does so in a very realistic way. Le Carre' lays it as it is, without monumental, last-minute twists, yet nevertheless, it is a fast-paced dramatic thriller.
All the actors, especially Stellan Skarsgar (""River""), Evan McGregor ("" Star Wars"") and Damian Lewis (""Homeland""), deliver a superb performance.

7740827,5,B01EVKI0BK,"One of John Le Carre's best and most poignant spy thrillers. The storyline hits hard at the moral power play between government/personal greed and service to its people. It realistically uncovers what big money corruption of politicians looks like and it's frequent relationship to their country's clandestine services. Ewan MacGregor and Naomie Harris have great chemistry and are convincing in their roles as a upstanding university professor and barrister, respectively. The opening scene is a bit gratuitous, but the movie never hits a dull patch. Damian Lewis, a favorite of mine, plays his empathetic/cold-hearted MI-6 persona with aplomb, and as far as I am concerned, swedish actor Stellan Skarsgrd,gave an oscar-worthy performance in his co-starring role as a russian mobster. For anyone who loves Le Carre and Ludlum, this is a must see movie.  You won;t be disappointed. Those who gave this less than 5 stars are likely looking for the action and excitement of a Jason Bourne blockbuster. This is cerebral and evocative best watched with a glass of red wine from Chateau Petrus next to your loved one who also enjoys a fine wine along with a fine movie.",1501891200,7,1164,5.0942408376963355

Lousy script.. pretty much the only English Skarsgard's character knew was the f-word. LOADS of f-bombs.

OK performances by the other actors. Nothing special.

Adult content.. yeah. The worst of it was a scene of anal rape.

The ending was quite predictable.

I don't have much positive to say about this film. At least there was an interracial couple in the movie. These days, it's more common to see a gay couple in a film than a straight interracial couple. I ask you, which is the bigger taboo?",1497916800,,736,4.630769230769231

Ewan McGregor becomes an unwitting covert agent for the British Government helping to bring in a foreign traitor ready to spill secrets not only on his own government, but on the British government as well. It is a bit complicated, but not hard to follow. The discord among British governmental factions is a big part of this story. It is very difficult to believe that an intelligent couple (McGregor, and his wife) allow themselves to be put in such a dangerous position on what seems to be a whim.

7740910,4,B01EVKI0BK,"I thought this was well done. LeCarre's spy productions are more of a thinking movie rather than being dominated by lots of crazy action. Like in ""A Most Wanted Man,"" you are guessing right to the end. Skarsgaard's acting stole the show.",1477094400,,237,4.666666666666667
7740911,3,B01EVKI0BK,"'The Spy Who Came In From The Cold' by John Le Carrie is one of my favorite books. I am a great fan of spy thrillers, and I have read everyone of his books. However, 'Our Kind of Traitor' is not a book nor a film that meets my Spy meter challenge.

The movie was directed by Susanna White, and the film has its moments, but too many. Ewan McGregor plays Perry Makepeace, (yes, that should have given us  great pause) who plays a Professor of Literature at London University. His wife, played by Naomi Harrisis is a barrister Gail Perkins. The star of this film is Stellan Skarsgrd, who plays Dima, a member of the Russian Mafia who has made a bad choice. Skarsgard is a well known star in Scandinavia and in the US. His acting is what dreams are made of. The rest of the cast is fine,  Damian Lewis, is an MI-6 officer who is bewitched, bothered and bewildered by his present and past superiors.

This film's premise is a good one, but soon loses contact with reality. The prof, Peacemaker is a go between the Russian Mafia and MI-6, sound bewildering, yes, indeed. The cast is excellent, the book not up to LeCarre's standards, and the film is simply-so-so. Somewhere along the line, the thrill of spies has lost it's appeal in this film.

Recommended For Some. prisrob 10-20-16",1476921600,11,1279,4.448717948717949

8759633,4,B01EVKI0BK,"A couple of great actors and a good plot. I was intrigued throughout. Stories about the Russian mob are always interesting to me, mix that with the MI6 and I'm in. While there is some action (and violence) most of the film focuses on intelligence failures and government corruption, which I liked. Recommended.",1536969600,,310,4.867924528301887

A kind husband and wife try to help a Russian family stay alive and step in to make the British government do the right thing. A spy who loves to cook large meals for one. A teacher who loves his wife and his fellow man. A wife who is a great lawyer. People helping each other survive. A lot of wine,romantic  vacations,guns and action.",1529884800,,448,4.530864197530864
