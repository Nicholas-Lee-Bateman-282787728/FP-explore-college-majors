2478796,5,B000E1EHPY,"This was so great to connect with my child hood. I grew up playing Sgt. Pepper Anderson. When I found this, I bought it and showed my kids what a good police drama was.  I can not wait until season 2-4. I hope Sony will produce the rest of the seasons for us to enjoy.",1157673600,6,268,3.8727272727272726
2478797,5,B000E1EHPY,"i remember like it was yesterday. what a great series. i hope to see the second season released soon. it would be great to have  police story released also in the dvd sets. the first show on this dvd is a police story as they transfer pepper anderson to her new assignment, as police woman.",1152489600,6,290,4.2727272727272725
2478798,5,B000E1EHPY,"Great show We just need to make sure Columbia and Sony will release more seasons of this classic show ASAP! I realize it prob doesn't sell huge numbers but I hope us fans aren't left in the cold over the show - it really is a great to see again. I'm ready for more!

Fans of this show should buy Season 1 so we can maybe get the rest of the show. For some odd reason Sony didn't do the best with pricing on the set. Yes it is retail 49.99 39.99 would have been better to help sell the show BUT I still think it was worth every cent. However for some odd reason the very day the show was released all of the Best Buy stores that stocked the set had it priced $49.99 which was retail That was it! Not Best Buys fault but Sony for what they had it priced at towards retailers. In the end it drove sales of the show to be very weak. it is a real shame the show is great .. Sure it doesn't have the power of selling like shows that are still airing today but had DVD been released back in Police Womans day then you would have seen sales like Desperate Housewives etc.

Sony Should release the remaining seasons for fans. Finish what you begin .. don't release a season of a show and move on to something else. With all the useless tv shows being released cause they are just a ""fad"" Police Woman was quality Release the other season and get some promotions out on it! Angie - Earl and the rest of the gang deserve all seasons released! Give us more Sony!",1145836800,28,1450,4.048780487804878
2478799,5,B000E1EHPY,"Sure, its period 70s action, but if you've ever seen some of the action flicks of the 70s like COFFY or FOXY BROWN, you know that some of them are more violent than anything being made today. In some ways, POLICE WOMAN is surprisingly violent. When was the last time you saw an episode of a cop show where a bank robber shoots a witness with a shotgun? And in that same episode, the POLICE use shotguns to blow people away. The controversial lesbian episode, FLOWERS OF EVIL, (which was only shown once on TV) is very entertaining and nothingthat GLAAD would get upset about. In fact, one of the final scenes has Angie getting one of the women to confess by relating that she isn't shocked or judgmental and in fact had a gay roommate in college who fell in love with her. The colors on the show are vibrant and the acting is swell with lots of fun guest stars (William Shatner, Larry Hagman, Bob Crane, Rhonda Fleming, Monte Markham, Marian Mercer, William Katt, Smokey Robinson, Della Reese, Robert Vaughn, Lara Parker, etc). Best of all is the numerous commentaries--two solo one with Angie Dickinson butthe majority with Angie and Earl Holliman chatting. Their great chemistry is still strong 30 years later...esspecially when they start bickering over facts (their Who's On First-like monologue about Mark Harman is laugh-out-loud funny; and Angie still has an infectious laugh--at one point she laughs at a piece of dialogue and just cant stop laughing). This show hasn't been in syndication in years, so most of the episodes are still surprising and fresh. I cant wait for season two! And keep those commentaries coming!",1145318400,43,1627,4.7935943060498225
2478800,5,B000E1EHPY,I can't say how pleased I was when I saw that this show was released on dvd. Growing up I loved this show and it brings back fond memories of when it originally aired in the 70's. They did a great job on this first season packaging. The only thing that bugs me and I wonder if any other loyal fans of the show notice is that they keep getting Pepper's real first name wrong. After watching the first disc there are at least 2 episodes where they say that her name is Leeanne. Actually she says it herself in Episode 9-The Stalking of Joey Marr. Minor point  can't wait for season 2.,1144454400,5,582,4.150442477876106
2478801,5,B000E1EHPY,"I was in college when Police Woman premiered in 1974.

It was on Friday nights and was a popular series for my grandparents.  I remember occasionally stopping by their house on a Friday evening and watching this show with them.

So this brings back a lot of great memories, and picture quaility is great.  Also, fun to see 70s L.A. in all it's glory.

I am going to enjoy it!",1143676800,8,375,4.3
2478802,5,B000E1EHPY,"In the mid-1970's Police Woman was one of my favorite shows.  I longed to grow up to be like Angie Dickinson, and admired her so.  (I still do).  Earl Holliman was gorgeous too!  It is so nice to see this show on DVD.  The cast and chemistry were fantastic--especially between Angie Dickinson and Earl Holliman.  Except for the occasional use of 70's phrases--like ""Turkey"" and ""pad,"" some of the guys' sideburns, and Charles Dierkopf's (I am probably spelling that wrong) funky hat, the show has held up well.  It does not appear obviously outdated the way some other 70's shows do.  The stories are typical 70's--drugs, hookers, murderers and rapists--with time spent on character development, rather than on forensics and technical stuff. Well written and acted. The presentation on this set is very nice for the price.  There are 3 clear slim plastic cases inside the master case.  Each one has a different paper insert with a great photo of Angie Dickinson on the inside, and one on the outside.  There are really 3 photos--all from the same shoot, but different poses, and they are alternated so that the outside of one is the inside of another, etc. The discs themselves look very nice too.  The whole set looks classy, particularly compared to the way some other shows are being released (for example, the dismal job Universal did with the presentation of MacMillan & Wife).  Someone put care and thought into the Police Woman set, and it shows.  I have just finished watching 1 1/2 disks over a rainy weekend, and the quality has been terriffic. The picture is clear and bright, and the sound is crisp.  They even included the little promo bits that used to show before each episode (or as coming attactions after the previous show). I like that! As aonther person already pointed out--the show had a really great theme song.  I have to say that after all this time, I really only remember bits of one or two episodes, so I can't say if the episodes are in order, or cut or anything.  However, if anything is cut (and I don't know that it was) it was done seamlessly, because nothing appears to be missing.  This is a class act of a set!  I highly recommend it. I'm going back to watch the rest!  Can't wait for Season 2.***************After writing this, I watched one of the ""special features.""  It was fabulous--it was an entire episode, with a running audio commentary by Angie Dickinson and Earl Holliman as they sat and watched it together!  It was so neat to listen to them chat and comment!!  Wow--what a great bonus!!",1142121600,22,2535,4.672686230248307
2478803,5,B000E1EHPY,"I actually forgot, just how exciting, Police Woman's theme song was, until I bought the Police Woman DVD box set. However, I have never forgotten just how deliciously beautiful Angie Dickinson is. She made that show worth watching, and she still does.",1141862400,10,251,5.0
2478804,5,B000E1EHPY,"In 1975, this became the hottest show in the United States and many other countries, and ALSO became the first successful drama series in TV history to feature a woman in the title role.

And although this may sound like faint praise, in an era where Emma Peel had regrettably become a faded memory, if it hadn't been for ""Police Woman"", there literally would have been no (albeit more-fanciful) ""Charlies Angels"", ""Wonder Woman"", ""Bionic Woman"" or, a few years later, muscular ""Cagney & Lacey"".

But suffice it to say that Season 1 of ""Police Woman"" is easily its best year: the show was, for the period, edgy and focused, with Angie Dickinson (then) chewing the scenery with a mesmerizing blend of toughness and effervesence; and her chemistry with co-star and onscreen boss Earl Holliman is very good as well... In this freshman season, ""Police Woman"" often felt like a taut, foreboding movie, both dark and sun-streaked... No wonder it went to Number One for a few months that summer.

Subsequent seasons weren't quite the same... There was pressure to tone down Miss Dickinson's almost effortless sex-appeal, and in so caving to pressure, the series wound-up squelching her personal power and strength as well, and so the show went off-track a bit: as a result, only about 50% of the episodes of seasons 2 and 3 are really up to par, and season 4 contained just a small handful of good installments.

Perhaps all that's why the show seems to have disappeared from view for quite a while...

Regardless, season 1 is an absolutely great '70s cop show classic-- funny, dramatic, a bit shocking for TV (at the time) in places, with a moody and often-cinematic '70s flavor--- and Angie Dickinson and Earl Holliman NEVER had such a good vehicle.

4/17/06: Unfortunately, no one seems to know it's on DVD, and the mediocre sales reflect that. Plus, it hasn't been available much for a while, so the kids haven't seen it.",1135900800,93,1918,4.796969696969697

2478854,4,B000E1EHPY,I use to watch this show along with all the other detective series in the 70s. It took me back in time and was fun to watch and listen to Ms. Dickenson narrate some of the individual shows along with Earl Holliman. The series still holds up and may have been a bit racy for its day.  Worth the purchase. Also still love the theme music to the opening shows....better than most of the other things on TV today.,1362787200,2,409,4.177215189873418

2478856,1,B000E1EHPY,"Before I bought this set I looked at all the reviews and thought this must be a good series. It is RUBBISH. The scripts are boring, disjointed, and there is only about 30 seconds of real action in each episode I saw.

I looked at the episodes on the first two discs, they were boring, nothing but talk. Looked at disk 3 and this would not play at all.  Finally got rid them in the bin where rubbish belongs, a total waste of money.  Even the Pilot episode taken from the POLICE STORY Series was slow, no action. If I had been able to see the pilot episode before buying I would have saved my money.  Regrettably now, I ordered the 1st series of POLICE STORY before I received POLICE WOMAN, I expect this (hopefully wrong) to be the same kind of boring materialwhen it arrives.  Nothing in the police type series touches T.J.HOOKER, this is action and suspense all the way through.

The pleasant surprise to me however was how enjoyable I found the show to be. Granted the story line is remarkably similar episode to episode but the ensemble is very entertaining. As a middle aged man I find I often love shows I didn't like as a child, and can't sit through shows I adored at age 10. I think any fan of 1970's crime dramas will do well to buy Police Woman.

2478881,5,B000E1EHPY,"SOME SPOILERS IN HERE!!!

I'm in love with Angie Dickinson and I don't care who knows it! For the past two weeks I've been watching Police Woman - Season 1 on DVD and let me just tell you all - it is frickin' amazing. When I was a kid I remember thinking Angie was super cool and it didn't hurt that my favorite aunt - Nauntie Dianne as I call her - thought she looked like Angie and even had the hair to prove it!

At the time Angie was doing a TV show called Cassie & Company which was basically Police Woman as a detective but I loved it and I loved her. The re-runs of Police Woman (which aired from 1974-1978) were usually on tv so I remember watching a few episodes but didn't really remember anything about them. So when I found out this was being released, I hopped onto netflix and put those suckers in my q - Little did I know what brilliance would be spurting from my DVD player.

Originally broadcast as an episode of Police Story Angie played undercover police woman Lisa Beaumant. Now Police Story was created by and overseen by a real life police officer and the show was praised for its realistic take on the world of police officers and before Angie had even finished her one off episode the suits were talking SPIN OFF!

Angie had been around for years and years having made some pretty good films - check out Big Bad Mama for some real fun! - including the original Ocean's 11 where she acted circles around that horse head Julia Roberts who played the role in the remake; anyhoos, Angie didn't want to do tv but they asked her if she wanted to be a household name and she thought that was a pretty good idea.

When she agreed to the show she made one change, she didn't like the character name and thought something spicier would be in order, apparantly what she didn't think about is that the producers let her pick the name - but it all worked out cuz Pepper Anderson came to be and I can't think of another name quite as cool for a police woman.

You may be wondering how I know all this crazy stuff - well its because Angie and her co-star Earl Holliman do commentary on tons of episodes and it is frickin' hilarious. Angie who I always thought was classy tough proves it on these commentaries - we find out so much - like she hated night shooting, she had a clause in her contract to be home by 6 pm to be with her daughter and when the producers realized they were running late they'd pull out the popcorn and beer and film a bar scene (the cops hung out in a bar) and Angie would forget all about the time. Though she couldn't drink too much beer (which she loves) because her eye lids got droopy... fascinating shizz huh?

but the most important thing is the show is really good - I thought it'd be kind of campy but not at all, full of ""how much bread for the junk?"" and ""freeze turkey"" type of things it's a flip right out of the 70s and Ang looks faboo, not to mention tough - in the very first aired episode she blows a villian away with a shotgun!

I have come up with a brilliant idea to take the show and make it into a movie a la the Brady Bunch films where ""undercover"" Pepper Anderson still wears the crazy 70s clothes as she goes undercover in her dangerous scenes and hopes she isn't ""made out"" to be a cop. I think it'd be great, but until then I'm going back to watch more Police Woman (and then re-watch with commentaries) next up is episode 10 ""Flowers Of Evil"" where crazed lesbians who run an elderly home are killing their residents! I can't wait to hear what Angie has to say about that!",1214352000,4,3535,4.20353982300885
2478882,5,B000E1EHPY,"A great show that would hold up today minus the horrible clothes and hair doos.

2478896,5,B000E1EHPY,"Like many shows back in the 70's, This one was one of my favorites, along with Swat, Starsky and Hutch, and Baretta. Police Woman was a ground breaking show, showing that a woman can be tough yet feminine in her work. I remember being 11 years old, and having a huge crush on Angie Dickenson. The commentaries are great also. Love it....",1186099200,3,337,4.451612903225806
2478897,5,B000E1EHPY,"I initially watched these shows when they were repeats back in the mid 80's.

I am not sure what I like looking at more, Angie, the decor in Pepper's apartment, or the cars. I would give anything to have that Mercury Couger that Pepper drives.

If you were old enough to remember the 70's, you will really enjoy this show. I can not wait for more seasons to be released.",1183680000,5,370,4.271428571428571
2478898,5,B000E1EHPY,"Angie Dickinson has as much charisma as any female in the history of television. And it's the kind of charisma that comes from a deep sense of personal character. Put that together with her wonderful beauty and you have one of the best and most important female characters in TV history. Put her together with Earl Holliman and you have a female/male team that never gets old, always seems fresh and real and human. Put that together with 70's style, the cars, the clothes, the lingo, and you get a cop show that is as much fun to watch as any cop show that has ever been on the air. If you watched this when it first aired you will love seeing it again.

The DVD extras are marvelous. There are a ton of very insightful comments from both Angie and Earl in the commentaries, and the both of them make you feel as if you are an old friend sitting with them in a nice, cozy place and watching a show that they loved doing.

I just hope that season 2 will be released and very soon.",1182384000,10,980,4.207446808510638
2478899,5,B000E1EHPY,"I completely missed this show when it was on TV (I was only about 3 years old), but I have to say, it was worth the wait! True to the 1970s, this show is edgy (on par & sometimes edgier than current cop shows)--since it's not saddled with political correctness, the issues the show deals with are direct & raw, yet, because it was the 1970s, the show isn't visually gruesome like so many shows are now. The show is amusing at times--watching the actors jump around with their guns acutally reminded me of 6 year olds pretending to be cops on TV during recess--not very convincing as cops, but did the job for a 1970s adventure show. Angie Dickeson is really fun to watch, she's tough, and feminine, and fun, and when put in context for a groundbreaking female-led show, it's really fabulous to see where shows like Charlie's Angels & Alias began. The main cast has a fun cameraderie, which is a pleasure to watch from show to show. I am thrilled with the series and am so glad I took the risk to purchase it, since I had no idea what it would be like. What I love the most, though, is the theme song. Even after watching the full season, I still found myself grooving to it. Policewoman rocks!",1176163200,12,1193,4.354260089686099
2478900,5,B000E1EHPY,"Want insight into the 1970s?  Get this DVD.  Angie Dickinson is great as a woman sleuth.  She is tough yet tender and she has a unique talent in being what the undercover role calls for.  If she is a waitress she LOOKS and acts the part... same as a flight attendent (stewardess)or hooker etc.  Very interesting show some lines are a bit off the wall but overall an interesting and entertaining view!

There should DEFINITLY BE A SECOND SEASON RELEASE!",1176076800,6,452,4.5875
2478901,5,B000E1EHPY,"This is a very good police show from the 1970s.  Angie Dickinson is a very beautiful woman or as they say today ""she is hot"".  However, Angie's beauty and talent aren't the only aspects of the show.  The show is action packed and deals with some gritty topics.  The team led by Earl Holliman gels as they solve the crime.

I also appreciate the stars adding commentary to some episodes.  It is a shame that the other seasons may not be released due to mediocre sales as this television series deserved better.",1174780800,5,509,4.478260869565218
2478902,5,B000E1EHPY,"I have been waiting for this boxed set to be released for ages and I wasn't disappointed. Quite edgy stories for the time and maybe even more so in some respects than what would be featured now. If you like the 70s cop shows - the action, the cars, the clothes etc - then you will love this. The extras are a little light on but I bought it to watch the original show so who cares! Now they just need to bring out the other series along with Streets of San Francisco and the Zimbalist Jnr FBI series. Highly recommended",1168473600,8,519,4.148514851485149
2478903,5,B000E1EHPY,"I was very young when Police Woman first aired back in the 70's, but I remember sitting up with my grandmother and watching it EVERY week. As soon as I saw the package that infectious theme song popped into my head and I remembered myself as a kid running around with my mother's police badge and my water pistol, pretending to be Pepper.

Police Woman was groundbreaking for the times.  It featured a WOMAN as the lead character.  At a time when there weren't many women police officers PERIOD, the lead character was not only a COP, but a DETECTIVE and a Sergeant.  With it's often film noir qualities, Police Woman covered subject matter that other shows were too afraid to touch. This is something we take for granted today with shows Like the Law and Order shows and CSI where they give us everything and then some.

Each week we viewers saw Sgt. LEANNE *not Suzanne* ""Pepper"" Anderson deal with the criminals as forcefully as the men, but also with humanity when it was necessary.  Along with Investigators Joe Styles and Pete Royster, and their immediate supervisor Sgt. Bill Crowley *Not Lt.*, the team members of LAPD's Criminal Conspiracy Investigations unit took a no holds barred approach to tagging the heavies and busting up the crime rings. Pepper was CCI's Secret Weapon.  Many times, she went undercover in order to gain the evidence needed to take down the bad guys. And OFTEN, it was Pepper who used what appeared to be minor evidence and pieced it together to get a break in the case.

This show was, and still is appealing because it was hip without being over the top.  The plots are timeless because crime doesn't really change. Then there's the undeniable chemistry between Pepper and Bill that, *With thanks to Angie and Earl*, permeates through even in the first episode they film together; Warning to All Wives.  Bill's relationship with Pepper can be best explained as boss/father/brother/husband/best friend...in other words they're ""Intimate Friends"" *CUE THE EDDIE KENDRICKS SONG* You will easily find yourself getting totally engrossed in the stories because you will be drawn in with wonderful comraderie between the members of the CCI team. You will also find yourself laughing at the double and triple entendres they toss at one another. (Esp. Pepper and Crowley).

So, with this said, why buy this dvd boxset?  Well for one, the Police Woman dvd set is BY FAR one of the best packaged box sets released. You really get your money's worth. Someone else already mentioned the wonderful pictures on the slimline cases *Thank you Sony*. Also, there are SEVEN AWESOME COMMENTARIES that are informative and entertaining *Thanks Angie and Earl*.  And I must add that the picture quality is pretty decent.

Police Woman is a show that should DEFINITELY be in your classic 70's tv collection.

Now if only Sony would release the rest of the seasons.",1162944000,14,2876,4.852760736196319
2478904,5,B000E1EHPY,"The perfect formula for Police Woman!!! I have to admit that I didn't remember much about this show during it's orginal run, because I was just a kid, but to be taken back to my favorite time warp was FABULOUS!!! Only Philip Michael Thomas could still look fine as wine in a pink three-piece suit!!! Right on Baby!!!

Angie Dickinson was so cool as Pepper Anderson. She kicked butt and nabbed the bad guys and girls for that matter, BCA (Before Charlie's Angels). Angie also had a dynamite supporting cast, and I just loved when Sargeant Styles played her pimp ""Silky""! He could be my pimp anytime!!!

Although this season is filled with some really strong episodes, I absolutely hated when Pepper wore a wire. It just made the story too predictable, I liked it alot better when the plot gradually comes together. All in all an excellent dvd set!!! I hope the remaining seasons get released soon!!!",1161216000,7,898,4.677215189873418

Amazon is a great place to buy and I love them, but they need to watch these inflated prices because the studio is not making new disks hence the high price should be taken off the market.
The show is good not great, great actors well done but a little slow.
Would I recommend to a friend? No way wait till they release all 4 seasons.",1438732800,,603,4.07563025210084
