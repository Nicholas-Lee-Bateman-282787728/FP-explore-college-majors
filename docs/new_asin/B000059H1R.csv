The series' power is beyond what any other anime series I've encountered has. Series like Gundam Wing and Robotech are good, but they don't grab you by the mind and affect your thoughts.
The DVD quality is just a great as others. As I always say, BUY IT!",1002844800,4,394,4.12987012987013
1404382,4,B000059H1R,"The Episodes in this DVD are REALLY intense. A ncie touch is that they added the menu startup as linking to an Evangelion in an entry plug - its kinda cool and kinda stupid at the same time. The episodes themselves though - well, this has what I think is one of THE coolest eps. of Eva yet - the falling Angel! All 3 Evas are dispatched to catch a falling Angel with physical and AT field strength. Misato promises the pilots a steak dinner if they can pull it off, and the think she is crazy for asking them. They all go and cheer for the steak dinner, and then when Misato leaves they all look at one another and think: ""Save the world for some steak? Err...."" The other 2 Episodes are one about SEELE, the overseers of NERV, and one about a strange Angel. It's depicted as glowing Orange and Red spots in an Eva test chamber. It has an AT field impervious to maintenance lasers, and tries to invade Magi. This episode is all about Ritsuko. Not the greatest DVD I've ever seen, but I LOVE the Falling Angel Episode!",998438400,,1017,4.247422680412371
1404383,5,B000059H1R,"I've read people complain about the quality of the DVD menues, etc.  Don't let that stop you from purchasing this DVD.  This story is wonderfully written, and the animation is superb.  It is definately worth your tie even if you don't like this particular genre.  The characters are very in depth and well written.

1404385,5,B000059H1R,"Turning out to be one of the best anime series that I have seen in a long time, Evangelion has opnened my eyes to a new meaning in japanese anime (well at least for this kind). The only thing that bothers me is the constint show ups of adult material whaich parent would want to watch out for when letting a younger person see this movie. So far Evangelion has seemed to amaze me with it's stunning story line and robot fight sceens.",987465600,,433,4.228915662650603
1404386,2,B000059H1R,"This is an Americanized variation of the original EVA, which could be said to be common sense, since we are Americans, but you loose a lot of the original sense of show and entertainment by altering it this way, which was done. The translations in the subtitles are still flawed to some extent, and what is even worse, the visuals have not improved much over the original. This being that ADV Films' contract for this series was for the TV/broadcast variation, instead of the edition released to VHS and region 2 DVD, which is far superior. They were given the option, but having to pay a little more money, they declined. It might make sense from a business point of view, but the cost wouldn't be that bad in the long run. If you have a region 2 DVD player, and understand Japanese, or are willing to watch subtitles, then to reaffirm my statements, watch one of the releases Gainax/Panasonic put out in Japan of this series. You will definetly see a difference.",982627200,5,964,4.578034682080925

1404388,5,B000059H1R,"The fourth disc of Neon Genesis Evangelion marks a turning point in the series, although it may be one that's not immediately noticeable.  From here on out the characters begin to lose control of their lives, surroundings and the world as the series speeds up to its conclusion in disc eight.
If disc number three marked the calm before the storm, disc four is the light, overcast sprinkle that hints at the coming hurricane.  The first episode on the disc is much like those seen previously, but it's obvious that the characters' hopes of a proactive campaign against the Angels are slowly turning more defensive and desperate.  The second episode highlights that even more as we see very little of Shinji, Asuka and Rei, but instead focus on a completely different Angel attack that leaves NERV only moments away from destruction.
The third episode (number 14 of 26), though, marks the real break with the first half of the series.  The minimalist style of flahsbacks, on-screen text and slow addition (and subtraction) of questions about the series is a style that the director, Hideaki Anno, will use more and more frequently as the series progresses.  While this episode may seem to be the typical 'midpoint-of-the-series' recap that so many other anime series have, it also marks a serious shift in focus, style and priority in the series (not to mention an increasingly dwindling budget on the part of the production studio).
Nonetheless, this disc is every bit as good as the three preceeding it, if not better.  As the direction and tone of the series continue their curve into the frantic, the series truly begins to separate itself from virtually any other anime series ever made.
Technically, this disc is as minimal as its predecessors.  The video and audio, though, remain first-rate.  As with the other discs, I would eventually love to see a version with more extras and episodes, but for now I am content to simply own it on DVD.
As with disc three, I do not recommend starting with this disc, but if you for some reason felt the need to skip the first half of the series, then definitely get this DVD.  ""Evangelion"" continues to improve on itself throughout the course of the series and this volume is no exception.  With the sole caveat that there are no special extras save a minimal character biography section, I wholheartedly recommend this DVD of ""Evangelion"" just as much as the previous ones.",981244800,15,2418,4.818840579710145
1404389,5,B000059H1R,"At this point, Evangelion really starts to get going. First, a little bit of Misato's past is explained as well as some more fan service for her. The second episode has the three pilots testing in their EVAs with no clothes. But that only part B. Part A of the story is the Angel which is a virus threatening to take over the MAGI system. This episode also gives fan service to Ritsuko and her past as well. The last episode has Shinji and Rei testing in opposite EVAs, but to know prevail. The majority of the episode is mostly spent on recapping all that has happend thus far. Overall, these episodes will leave many wanting more and more. But I guess thats what makes Evangelion so great. It gives you a small taste and keeps you coming back for more. And if you think there isn't any reason to buy the DVD if you have VHS, your wrong. There is still the nicely dubbed versions of Spanish and French dialoge. The DVD will definetely contain Bios on Angel #10 and #11. This is also the turning point in Evangelion where everything starts getting shown. So if you are a new comer to EVA, you must see this volume. And how about ADV speed up they're releasing on this. Come on, the Evangelion movie comes out this summer. Lets hustle.",980640000,10,1234,4.369565217391305

1404403,5,B000059H1R,I bought this item to help complete a collection of the series. I was wonderfully surprised with the condition the item was in.,1198281600,,127,4.565217391304348
1404404,5,B000059H1R,"This dvd in my mind is not as exciting as the other dvds, yet it still sheds some light on certain characters.

In the first episode, we learn about Misato and her past. There is also an extremely cool scene in which the evas must stop an angel coming to earth. I think one of the more interesting scenes of the series is when the three kids are sitting on a cliff watching the sky without the illuminated city. The creator must of thought about this scene for a while, as it is perfect.

The second episode talks about Ritsuko alot. The magi are introduced, yet they aren't really made to seem that important later in the series.

The final episode is not particularly interesting to begin with because it is a recap of things you will have already seen. The end of the episode talks about Rei a little bit, and that is important for later.

If you loved the first three dvds, my review isn't going to stop you from buying this one. If you haven't seen the series yet, do yourself a favor and watch the entire series. I have talked to some people who didn't like the first dvd or saw a few episodes in the middle. Once you watch them all, you can truly appreciate the series.",1124841600,,1176,4.283783783783784
1404405,4,B000059H1R,"This series continues to grow on me as I watch it.  Volume 4 contains three episodes, 12 - 14, in the continuing saga of the giant Eva mechas' battle against the ruthless and mysterious ""angels"" bent on destroying the remnants of humanity left on Earth.

Episode 12 - We learn something about Captain Misato Katsuragi's past, and the reason she joined N.E.R.V.  The ninth angel Sahaqiel is plummeting to Earth.  The only way the Evas can stop it is with their bare hands?!?

Episode 13 - More character development, this time for Dr. Ritsuko Akagi.  We learn it was her mother who developed the three supercomputers known as the ""Magi.""  The tenth angel Ireul appears right inside command headquarters as a computer virus.

I applaud the presence of strong female characters such as Misato and Ritsuko in this series.

Episode 14 - An odd combination of a recap episode.  Recaps the battles with all the Angels thus far.  Recap is punctuated with glimpses of the mysterious organization known as Selles, that seems to have some power over N.E.R.V. and Commander Ikari.  We also have a strange poetic, monolouge by Rei.  Like I said, an odd episode.",1114300800,,1148,4.795918367346939
1404406,3,B000059H1R,"And once again another volume in the Platinum series has been released but unfortunatly its beginning to look as if this series, which started of very promising, can't fullfil the expectations which were created over the past releases.

This is still the Platinum release which offers an enhanced release of the original Evangelion series. It features better picture and sound quality - the sound even has been remade to meet 5.1 surround requirements - but all the extra's which one can expect from such a release are beginning to look much less special than they once did.

At first the number of episodes has been reduced from 4 to 3 (featuring episodes 15, 16 and 17), thus its getting at the same level of the original release. But all the extra's themselves are becoming mere re-runs of things already seen in the past as well! I really expected much better from ADV, especially when you take a look at another release of an outstanding Anime series; Robotech. This too is undergoing a re-release right now but when comparing the original boxed release of Robotech - Macross saga (3 boxes containing 3 dvd's each (2 episode disks and one special contents disk)) with the current Evangelion Platinum series the winner would still be Robotech; won by variation in every account.

So; apart from the 3 episodes on this disk it has a 12 page booklet, features an animatic of episode 15 (the same thing we've seen on disk 2), a commentary with Tiffany Grant (we've already met her on the previous 2 releases) and Matt Greenfield (we've heard and seen him on the previous release as well) and a ""documentary"" about (what a surprise) ""That little red haired girl"" where Tiffany Grant shows us her Evangelion collection (toys, posters, etc.).

Now; don't get me wrong here. This is a decent release with 3 cool restored Evangelion episodes, lets not lose track and forget that in the end its all about the cartoon itself. But having said that I simply cannot deny that this release is starting to look like a product which centres around a company and a few persons and totally seems to ignore what this is all about. While I consider the documentary about Tiffany's collection not that bad it would have been more interesting to focus on where those toys came from, get more into the hype called Evangelion. And although its nice to listen to yet another commentary I think that an interview with the original Japanese artists of the serie would have been more interesting. Allthough its nice to have the clean opening and ending on every disk so far it would also have been interesting to get into the shock which Evangelion has managed to create with episode 16. Even if they would have gone into that little extra detail about how the show was almost cancelled; showing us the warnings which have been send back then...

To summarize: ADV is making a decent collection but I can't begin to wonder if all the extra's are meant to be about the Evangelion serie or are mere there for the fame and glory of ADV and its co-workers. I'm not denying that they're doing a very nice job when it comes to the DVD releases and creating extra dubs. But please let us not forget that this serie is originally Japanese, with Japanese voice actors and a very rich history which goes back much longer than the people of ADV.

Is this disk worth it ?  I suppose so. Still; if you don't care much about extra stuff like animatics, commentaties and such I'd seriously consider the orginal release. Although I think this collection is good fun, *nothing* can beat an original.",1107820800,6,3558,4.674121405750799
1404407,5,B000059H1R,"Now that was a truly awesome DVD. There may have only been three episodes, but they were excellent. A surprising amount of stuff happens in this short volume and it really has moved things along. I can't wait to find out more about the origins of the Evangelions and what Seele is really planning. Overall, it has solidified my interest in the series.

One of the things I thought was interesting was how there seem to be a lot of superlong episode names in the English version. I personally think the episode names should have stayed the same. I also would have prefered more episodes on this DVD. Only three, why? They can fit five without any trouble.

On the whole, while the DVD itself has some flaws, the episodes were awesome. I haven't seen all of Eva and that sets me apart from most anime fans, but I really want to see the rest.",1104537600,,839,4.406451612903226
1404408,4,B000059H1R,"Platinum Collection 4 only contains 3 episodes.  15, 16 and 17.  This strike me as odd since  01 and 02 contain 5 episodes each. 04 contained 4 episodes.  It seems to me that  there is no rime or reason to this box set.  Just a another way to  command more money from my wallet.  However the 5.1  sound quality is excellent.",1104364800,4,324,4.180327868852459
1404409,5,B000059H1R,"The three episodes on this DVD (12 thru 14) take us to the midpoint of the Evangelion series.  The preliminaries are over, we have been introduced to the players, and have become fully engaged in the efforts of three young people to stop a steady flow of attacks on the earth by strange creatures known collectively as 'angels.'
Even so, we really know very little.  In particular, the whys elude us.  With each episode, we have been granted a tiny hint that something truly momentous lies just under the covers, that this is much more than an up-to-date space opera.  Kabalistic symbols have danced in the air from the beginning, but now there are whispers of prophecies from the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Lance of Longinus.  Just what is Gendo Ikari's true agenda?
In Episode 12, 'The Value of a Miracle,'  Misato's promotion to major grants us a sudden insight into her own motivations.  However, any festivities must come to an end when a new angel (Sahaqiel) appears in the skies over NERV head quarters.  Asuka, Shinji, and Rei must stop it from crashing to earth like another meteor.
Then in 'Angel Invasion' a strange spreading corrosion turns out to be a nanotech angel (Ireul) intent on infecting the Magi - the three supercomputers that support NERV and Tokyo 3.  Ritsuko Akagi, NERV's chief scientist, must battle the ghosts of her mother to keep the Magi from self-destructing.
After two episodes of monster slaying, Episode 14, 'SEELE, Throne of Souls', is an entirely different piece of work.  It officially ushers in the second half of the series with a brief recap of past victories.  Rei's own philosophical questions about her own identity are counterpoint to a nearly disastrous experiment with the EVA.  In the background, the increased role of the mysterious SEELE committee raises more questions than it answers.
Hideaki Anno has proved himself a master at the subtle references that raise suspense and provide a continuous sense of mystery.  Even as he allows his characters an increasing level of humanity, he starts the process of questioning exactly what that humanity really is.",1037232000,8,2105,4.9124293785310735
1404410,3,B000059H1R,"- and that's condemning with faint praise. The only disc of the lot that's even worth renting as far as I'm concerned, because of the unique enemies this set of angels presents for a giant robot team. Otherwise, my reccomendations remain to look at Bubblegum Crisis (and not 2040, either - the original), Transformers, Macross Plus, or Vandread if you want mecha, or in the Drama and Art sections of the live-action movies if you want introspection and philosophical meaning. To put it another way, let me paraphrase one of the Adventures of Weeble and Bob webcomic/flash thingies:
Animefan sings to his Evangelion boxed set: I love Eva... Eva don't lie... I love Eva... almost as much as mecha!
CD enters and looks at the box set: What this?
Animefan: ... Is mecha.
CD: Does not look like mecha.
Animefan: Is GOOOD mecha.

This is a very deep anime. You could watch it over and over, but still find a different meaning every time. The story is very heavy. The emotions of each characters are explored in depth. It's an older series, but the animation, voice acting, and music are all top notch. It is a near perfect series. My only beef with it is the final episode. The final episode is pretty much a psych evaluation of the main characters. When I first saw this series, I hated it b/c of the ending.

7933130,3,B000059H1R,"Neon Genesis Evangelion Collection 0:4 is a single DVD that contains episodes twelve through fourteen of the series.

When I first put this disc in the player, a trailer started.  It turns out that there are roughly nine-and-a-half minutes of trailers at the beginning of the disc before you get to the main menu.  Luckily, the disc was authored in such a way that you can skip ahead to the menu.  However, I feel that including that many trailers at the beginning of a DVD is rather obnoxious.

On the disc, you can select from four menu options; the options are ""Scene Access,"" ""Communications,"" ""Extras,"" and ""ADV Previews.""  For ""Scene Access,"" you can choose which episode you want to watch on the disc.  ""Communications"" is the option for subtitle and language selections.  For subtitles, you can choose to either have them on or off.  For language, you can choose from English, Spanish, French, and Japanese.

The ""Extras"" menu contains three options.  The first is labeled as ""Character Bios""; the bios include a picture of the character and a brief text write-up.  The characters included in this feature are: Ritsuko Akagi, Maya Ibuki, Adam, Tenth Angel, and Eleventh Angel.  The next feature is ""ADV Website""; all this selection does it to take you to a screen that has ADV's website featured on it; however, since ADV no longer exists, this link is rather irrelevant.  The final extra in this menu is the DVD credits.

The final selection on the main menu is labeled as, ""ADV Previews.""  Like the second and third discs, there is no menu to choose which previews to see.  Instead, it goes straight into the nine-and-a-half minutes of previews that are at the beginning of the disc.

I was a little disappointed to see that like the third disc in the set, this disc only contains three episodes.  However, the authoring of the disc is the same as for discs one and three; the viewer has the ability to skip the ending credits to get to the preview for the next episode and the subtitles were easy to read.

When watching the episodes on this disc, the religious allusions I have heard about in regards to this series finally become a bit more blatant.  While some earlier episodes may have subtly snuck some imagery in, the allusions have become more readily apparent to the viewer.  The first two episodes on the disc progress the story a little further, and they also include some character development for Misato and Akagi.  The third episode on the disc is basically a recap episode for the first half of it, while the second half involves a synchronization experiment with the Evas.  The recap portion of the episode was done in such a way to resemble a report to Seele.  Personally, I'm not a fan of recap episodes; however, I'm grateful that only half of the episode provided a recap.

If you're a fan of Neon Genesis Evangelion and haven't either already picked up this DVD release or one of the DVD box sets that were released for the series, this could be worth adding to your DVD library if you can find it for a reasonable price.

I wrote this review after watching a copy of this disc that I checked out through the King County Library System.",1324944000,,3167,4.649280575539568
