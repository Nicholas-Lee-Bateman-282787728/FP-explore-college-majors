486036,4,6302595770,"Pippin is a work of true genius. It's deceptivly simple at first - but after reading an essay on this show at fosse.com I soon understood the show at new levels! BUT, the video is flawed. This is not the Broadway  production. This is what...ah, yes, the Canadian Revival (! ) This  production was not directed by Bob Fosse. It's based on his original  direction (in some sort of weird way). Even Stephen Schwartz himself  dislikes this video.  Let's just pray for a cast recording or video from  the Papermill production (Which I've heard is breathtaking).",961632000,2,556,4.739583333333333
486037,4,6302595770,"Pippin is wonderful, and though I am a schwartz enthusiast myself, I have to say that Fosse blew the creative spark into Schwartz's work. The Pippin everyone remembers is Fosse's creative vision. Martha Raye is enthusiastic,  bubbly, and wonderful. Chita and Ben are, as always imcomprable, William  does a good job, although straining on ""Corner of the sky"". All  in all, a talented cast. The video is choppy in places, but helps the  audience especially one who may not have seen it before, understand what  Fosse had attempted to do. To do being in the past sense, because Fosse did  not direct the Canadian performance of Pippin. It was one of the original  dancers that worked under him. All in all, though, the video is well worth  seeing and owning, and if you enjoy Fosse, make you sure you pick up uour  copies of Cabaret, and Sweet Charity.",960336000,6,850,4.6891891891891895
486038,3,6302595770,"It's a shame.  Pippin is a great show, but any audio/visual representation of it is below par.  The CD has major flaws, and this video has even more.  Teh problem does not lie with the cast, which is great, or Fosse's  direction/choreography, which is superb.  Teh video itself leads much to be  desired.  In the song ""Glory,"" it is impossible to figure out  what is goin one.  Many of hte osngs were either trimmed or cut comptetly,  and the quality of tahe filming itself was adequate at best.  This movie is  worth seeing if you've never seen the show and are interested to see what  it was all about, or for Fosse's work.  And, as I said before, the music,  book, etc. is great.  Otherwise, this movie is a dud.",959731200,3,715,4.384615384615385

I bought the soundtrack to the broadway production and thought the music was nice, but was mistaken as to what was goiong on onstage as they were sung, especially the song ""  With You "" Suprise, suprise!

486116,4,6302595770,"I've heard that this video is inferior to the original Broadway performance, but never having seen that show, I can't say what's different. I *have* heard the original cast album, and can state definitively that many of the musical numbers are shortened, which is a pity.

The other reviewers' complaints about this being badly shot are on target. The quality of the recording is low; in fact, at the beginning, you can see the distortion at the bottom of the screen where the playing VCR's tracking control was off! This DVD was made from a VHS tape!

So if the quality is so low, why am I giving it four stars?

The cast, plain and simple. The cast puts together an astonishing tour de force, singing, dancing, and acting with split-second precision.

Special praise has to go to Ben Vereen. Man, I've never seen anything like him before. He's a terrific actor, terrific singer, and good heavens, can he dance! Despite the high quality of the cast overall, this is Vereen's show. He's in nearly every scene, in a marathon-like performance. You can see the sheen of sweat on his face toward the end. He puts everything he has into his performance, and it shows.

The music, top-notch. The acting, top-notch. The dancing has to be seen to be believed.

Regarding the play itself, while you may or may not love it, you're not likely to have seen anything like it. ""Pippin"" is a weird play: part-parable, part-comedy, part-drama, and part-absurdist. Some plays toy with the Fourth Wall; this one gleefully knocks it down, referring and sometimes speaking directly to the audience. The Leading Player even tries to goad one of his actors into doing something by pointing out how much the live audience members had to pay for their seats! It brings to mind the Absurdist plays of Becket, yet also the disassociation techniques of Bertolt Brecht.

The play never lets you forget that you're watching a play, and it gleefully folds in on its own stylistic performance. In one classic bit, Katt's Pippin is attending Charlemagne's war council, at which everybody knows what to do but Pippin. When he is chided by his father, Pippin does his best to fit in, including adopting the bizarrely stylized Bob Fosse-esque pose of the soldier frozen to his immediate right. Not only are the poses bizarre, ""Pippin"" draws attention to how bizarre it is by having a ""normal"" character trying to imitate it. The result is a delightful sort of a mixture of Kabuki, Theater of the Absurd, and Monty Python!

The song and dance numbers are brilliant, and from me that's saying a lot, since I've never really gotten into musicals, This is the first that's really captured my zeal. Heck, after seeing the play, I went to YouTube hoping to find videos showing me how to do some of those dance moves! :D

Until a better version of the play shows up on DVD (I'd love to see the original 1970's performances, if they exist somewhere) this will have to do. The recording quality is poor, but it's a lot better than nothing, and the experience is well worth it!",1439683200,8,3032,4.694915254237288

486118,3,6302595770,"Bob Fosse disowned this production, and it's easy to see why. Without his fanatical eye on the proceedings, all the razor sharp choreography he devised for Broadway, becomes lazy and amateurish. It's the same show, but having said that, it's not the same show - because everything that really mattered to Bob Fosse has been diluted. How he allowed this to happen is a mystery.",1437177600,,376,4.8

486144,5,6302595770,"Musical theater fans will eat this up.  It is not the original cast save for Ben Vereen who is matchless--sinuous in voice and movement.  I remember seeing him in a preview of the first production and the audience fairly demonstrated the joy and excitement they took in his performance when he simply re-entered a scene.  Chita Rivera does Leland Palmer's old role, and she is inimitable.  Martha Raye (!) does the role Irene Ryan originated and Andrea Martin won a Tony for in the latest revival, and she is a surprise--singing well and keeping the mugging to a minimum.  William Katt is a revelation as Pippin (originally John Rubinstein)--guileless, handsome in face and voice.  This DVD is a delight.",1427241600,2,704,4.873949579831932

486287,4,6302595770,"PIPPIN was and is an unexpectedly controversial musical.  Directed and choreographed by Bob Fosse with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz and book by Roger O. Hirson, the play opened on Broadway with much fanfare in 1972--but reviews were mixed box office was failing until the producers did a television commercial for the show.  It was the first time a Broadway show had deigned to lower itself to the level of television advertising, but the results were spectacular.  The box office was slammed and the show ran 1944 performances.  But many critics remained unimpressed and considered the show's success a matter of clever marketing, and when the show closed, it seemed to go away entirely.  There were occasional regional productions, shows by colleges and community theatres, but the show didn't have a popular score to remind people of its existence.

But time has a way of telling us the truth about art.  PIPPIN has never had the same fame as, say, OKLAHOMA--but neither is it as relentlessly overworked.  We haven't heard it, seen it a thousand times, and although the music is very clearly rooted in early 1970s pop, it remains fresh and lively and feels new.  And the style is as unexpected as it ever was, a bizarre mixture of commedia dell arte, variety show, lots of flash, and ultimately an unexpected darkness that has significant jolt.  In 1981 Kathryn Doby, the dance captain of the original Broadway show, recreated PIPPIN for Canadian television.  It was one of the first serious efforts to capture the effect of live theatre before a live audience and it was unexpectedly successful.

The 1981 video version is not an exact recreation of the Broadway original.  A few songs are missing, verses are cut here and there, scenes are trimmed.  It also seems to soften Fosse's original choreography and the play's dark ending is not quite so dark.  Even so, it does give a remarkable notion of how the play operates.  ""Magic to Do"" begins the show by bring on The Leading Player (Ben Vereen, who originated the role on Broadway) and his minons, a colorful collection of clowns and jugglers and dancers.  Speaking and singing directly to the audience, they set for the story of Pippin (William Katt), son of Charlemagne, a young man who seeks absolute forfillment.  He tries war; he tries treason.  There's art and there's religion.  Ultimately he meets an ""ordinary woman,"" Catherine (Leslie Denniston), but although he falls in love, he elects to throw it all away for one last shot at perfection.

The play is extremely episodic, moving from one vignette to another.  We bounce from Pippin's father Charlemagne (Benjamin Rayson) to his unexpectedly free-and-easy grandmother (Martha Raye) to his evil stepmother Fastrada (Chita Rivera) as Pippin seeks the ultimate experience.  The dance numbers and songs are great and quite often unexpected and often strangely ironic.  ""Corner of the Sky"" betrays Pippin's innocence; ""War is a Science"" is a perverse take on the battlefield, very funny and very dark; ""With You"" is infamous as the love song Fosse choreographed into a sexual orgy.  The ultimate musical statement, I think, occurs with at the end of the play with ""The Finale,"" in which Pippin must literally choose between life and death, reality and illusion.  It's all remarkable stuff.

Could it have been better?  Probably.  It would be nice to have the thing unedited.  But Ben Vereen is incredibly good, William Katt is right up there with him, and the supporting cast is everything you could want, with Martha Raye's turn with ""Time to Start Living"" an audience favorite.

However, on stage it was a dazzling and imaginative spectacle, thanks to the brilliance of Bob Fosse and the creativity of Tony Waltons design. The performances were terrific, with Ben Vereen standing out, all making the utmost of the material. Try sitting through a community theater production and you will see what I mean.

However, strangely, this taped version of a live Broadway performance doesn't capture the magic. Vereen as always, gives it his all, as does the rest of the cast, including the addition of the great Chita Rivera as Fastrada. Somehow, without experiencing it live, it is merely interesting, but hardly the awe inspiring phenomenon that was the stage production experienced in person. My family, having never seen the show, thought it midly enteratining, but hardly a great musical. In short, there is a decided lack of magic in the video.",1359072000,2,979,4.862275449101796

how such DVD productions would be if they were recorded as
an audience member in the orchestra section; no ""editing.""
  This DVD recording captures the magic of the original
Broadway production, along with the classic choreography of Bob Fosse

486403,5,6302595770,"Pippin takes me on a trip down memory lane.  When I was little, my big sister (in high school) was a musical theater buff.  She always had at least half-a-dozen musical scores from Broadway shows strewn all over the piano at our house.  For some reason, Pippin was one of the most memorable for me.  Then in middle school, my chorus teacher showed this movie (on VHS) one day and I was hooked.  I think I had a little bit of an 11-year-old crush on William Katt, what with his curly blond hair, blue eyes, sweet tenor voice...  The music is good, the production is flawless and the staging is superb.

Now on a moral level, this movie is not appropriate for children.  My chorus teacher should not have shown this to a classroom full of 6th-graders.  It has mild bad language, drug use, murder, pre-marital sex, lies, and a rather vivid orgy scene.  I didn't get it at the time, thankfully, but now I do and I would never show this movie to anyone under 16.

On a trivial note, this production of Pippin was the first time a Broadway musical was made for the sole purpose of putting in on video.  This cast was not the Broadway cast (except for Ben Vareen, I think).  We've seen plenty of Broadway shows on video since then, so that was kind of ground-breaking.",1286064000,,1261,4.383620689655173

The great pieces of this time could be performed on an empty stage with good actors, and did not need the scenic distractions that we are used to today.
Fosse's production of Pippin is a great example. The scenery is minimal and the actors drive and tell the story. Clowning and commedia del arte style performances are employed with Fosse's choreography to tell the tale in broad, entertaining strokes. The filming of this production  is a great gift to afficionados who were not there to see it. The glorious performances and costumes create a sideshow feel that is not to be missed!",1266364800,,828,4.830985915492958
486407,3,6302595770,"My school is currently doing the production of the show ""Pippin"" as our 2008/09 season play this year. Now I am fortunate enough to have seen a video of a professional production floating around on the internet somewhere, and it was really well done. Then I saw this movie... I'll break down this version of the movie.

THE GOOD: We have a version of Pippin out on DVD finally. Ben Vereen is in it and gives a very good performance, after all he IS the Leading Player, nobody else can hold a candle to him. The set is FANTASTIC, Most of the cast are really good (William Katt ESPECIALLY), and not to mention this video was shot in Canada!

THE BAD: Several songs are cut down here. For example, half of Spread A Little Sunshine is cut out, therefore making it confusing to anyone who has not seen the show on stage already or have had any experience with Pippin whatsoever. The second (and most essential) verse of ""War Is A Science"" is out, ""Glory"" is extremely missed opportunity. The slow-mo battle scene is cut out! This isn't no G-rated happy-go-lucky play. And What happened to I Guess I'll Miss The Man??? Pacing problems also ensue; some fast songs are too slow, some slow songs are too fast (Simple Joys is ruined by this), and the cast seems to be rushing it at times, as if they have somewhere to be after the show. EVerybody, even the incomparable Ben Vereen is guilty of this (Glory is a sign of this). And the final line (cutting out ""But Happy"") is a total WTF moment.

THE UNFORGIVABLE: THe social Commentary/political overtones of the show are missing, and elements like Pippin not being used to life are gone and replaced with happy-go-lucky family version themes. This is a show that kids shouldn't watch. And the band of players didn't really come off to me as creepy, not to mention as much as Ben Vereen is an amazing actor and singer, he seems to be a tad psycho in the last 20 minutes. I felt like I was watching a demented lunatic serial killer have a freakout. Martha Raye's performance was PATHETIC (what's with the microphone????), and the guy who plays Charlamagne YELLS a lot, which did get on my nerves after a while. At times I wondered if Fosse even saw a production of the original production. Lastly, the camerawork is not the best- the audience shots on ""No Time at All"" make me cringe. THe blame for this falls squarely at the feet of Bob Fosse, who apparently had the wrong ideas.

In short, I give this 3 stars for Ben Vereen and William Katt, and the sets. I'd say purchase it, despite its flaws, because this is the best version we'll currently get on DVD.",1253232000,4,2597,4.472573839662447

486453,2,6302595770,"Background: I've seen Pippin 3 times on B'way, worked as make-up artist for over a dozen regional productions, and taught the play for years as the culmination of a course on poetry. In its original incarnation, Pippin is a production rich in allegory and metaphor, both visual and verbal, which becomes more meaningful with each viewing.

That said, executive producer David Sheehan's truncated televersion of the play cuts--no, slashes--so much of the production that it becomes devoid of both continuity and logic. First, the music: almost every number has a verse deleted, and one complete song (Catherine's ""I Guess I'll Miss the Man"") has been excised. As this song immediately foreshadows the events of the finale, its elimination is unforgivable.

As for the book, various exchanges among characters are missing. Some of the gaps are relatively minor, others glaring. After the battle sequence, Pippin's poignant discussion with the head of one of the enemy is missing. After his ascension to the throne, Pippin's sequential proclamations that lead to the realization of the flaw in his idealism have also been struck, which makes his final declaration of a ""limited police action"" too sudden and illogical. Catherine's lament for her late husband is missing. The most startling omission, though, is the death scene of her son's pet and its aftermath, during which Pippin gains an inkling of his epiphany in the finale and honestly earns Catherine's love. With this sequence removed, Catherine has no reason for loving him. Nor does the audience have reason to identify.

The play's cut-and-paste editing was no doubt done to conform to television time limits. Was it not possible, then, to restore the complete version for DVD? Or was it simply not worth the time and effort? Other reviewers have commented on the grainy quality of the image and poor sound reproduction, another pair of minuses. All in all, the magic is simply gone.

Postscript: Some 25 years after the show closed, Stephen Schwartz and Roger O. Hirson re-staged Pippin at NJ's Paper Mill Playhouse. The characters were dressed in 1970s attire, the choreography was disco, and Pippin himself was pulled from the audience and handed a script. It was a dark and joyless production, made more so by the fact that it was the very authors themselves who transformed a Broadway icon into a travesty of a high school musical.",1216684800,4,2395,5.071065989847716

It is perfect for showing many theatre ideas: 70's theatre styles, why it is important to study Theatre History (the play is reminiscent of the Commedia dell'Arte style of the Italian Renaissance), and Bob Fosse's choreograpy.

  The ""live theatre"" style is important for this class since movie things are very different from stage things.  And the play is a really good one in general: the songs are good and many of my students recognize ""Corner of the Sky"", the acting is superb - especially the inestimable Chita Rivera.

In the process of setting the time format for television many cuts were made to the original script, which unfortunetly are now not available.  What is important about this version is it allows the closest view of Bobby's original work that we may ever have.  Bob worked on this show while at great odds of the composer (Schwartz), to the point of having him barred from rehersals.  It is amazing the show ever made it to where it got.  The fact that we can still see the original art that was the choreography of Bobby, is the ONLY reason that this video should be in your collection.

Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to its expectations. The performances are wonderful, as other reviewers have pointed out. (With the exception of otherwise adorable William Katt's voice breaking quite a bit.) However, the maddening cuts have NOT been restored for the DVD, and the sound quality is very poor for a DVD.

After all, who could go wrong with an all star cast of broadway veterans led by Ben Vereen singing and dancing around the stage in his Tony Award winning role, William Katt, Chita Rivera, Benjamin Rayson, and Martha Raye. The singing, for the most part is right on except for William Katt who seems to have a little trouble getting started but gets it later. The best in the show though has to be stage and screen veteran Martha Raye as Berthe. I always have to sing along when she sings ""No Time At All"". Bob Fosse's choreography is great as usual. This is of the best scores in musical theatre with music and lyrics by award winning composer Stephen Schwartz, who also wrote musicals like ""Godspell"" and ""Children of Eden"" and more recently, movies for Disney and ""The Prince of Egypt"".

486542,2,6302595770,"""Pippin"" is a musical that has something to say.  This musical is a celebration of the individual going through life and having to see what is your calling or what you are meant to be.  Pippin is a young man on this quest.  Fresh out of college, Pippin is very unsure of what to do with his life, or where to go with it.  Through the course of this musical, he dabbles in war, sex, politics, love, and domesticity.  This journey leads up to the eerie ""grand finale"" goaded by the Leading Player.
So there you have it, a commendable story.  Unfortunately, the Stephen Schwartz musical score does a horrible disservice to a show that Bob Fosse directed so masterfully.  To me, a musical is NOTHING without a solid score.  I'm not just saying a musical has to have a million catchy tunes that you can whistle afterwards, but it wouldn't have hurt to have more than just two.  ""Magic to Do"" offers an enticing opening for the audience.  Everything falls FLAT after that, the only exception being ""No Time At All""--a funny heartwarming anthem about ""seizing the day.""  Not even Bob Fosse's visionary direction and choreography can make up for such a bland, uninteresting score.
Some performances do rise above this problematic production.  Ben Vereen and Chita Rivera, veteran Fosse disciples, really shine respectively as the Leading Player and Fastrada (Pippin's sex-pot stepmother).  Leslie Denniston gives an underrated performance as the ""ordinary"" Catherine.  The rest of the performances are so-so.  You just want to boot Christopher Chadman off the stage for his cheeky, unbelievably effeminate portrayal of Lewis--Pippin's stepbrother.  William Katt offers a ""teeny-bopper"" quality to his portrayal of the title role, but not much more.  Martha Raye was nice as Berthe, Pippin's granny, but I would have rather seen Irene Ryan (may she rest in peace).
The DVD suffers from the lack of sound quality and seems hastily produced.  On a decent sound system, there is no consistency in the sound balance.  Intensity of sound fades in and out, and at the worst times.  The video is decent, for the early eighties, but with the technology we have today, I expect a lot better.
If you really want to know the real spirit of ""Pippin,"" I wouldn't look here.  Try the original cast recording, or see an actual live production if you can.",1024099200,5,2330,4.848101265822785
486543,4,6302595770,"What can one say about a DVD that preserves much of what made it a hit on Broadway...Bob Fosse's Direction and Choreography?  It is a wonderful piece of musical theater history and a wonderful representation of a hit that stormed Broadway in the 70's.
That is not to say that this DVD is not without its problems.  One of the main problems is that part of the show have been edited out.  A song, jokes, a pivotal moment with a talking head are missing leaving viewers perplexed at times.  It seems that the editor didn't have a copy of the script to work from.  The saving grace is the wonderful performance of Ben Vereen as the Leading Player.  For those who want to see Vereen at his peak I would suggest you skip the Fosse DVD and get Pippin.  He was one of Fosse's favorite dancers and Pippin shows off his skills.  Other actors do a fairly admirable job with their parts.  William Katt is good at Pippin, but no matter how many times I watch this producation I get mad that he drops the last line of the show and loses some of its punch in the dropping.  Chita Rivera and Martha Raye handle their roles well and Christopher Chadman, who later went on to become a choreographer before passing away, reprises his role of Louis, Pippin's half-brother, and is as wonderful here as he was on Broadway.
Stephen Schwartz and Bob Fosse battled throughout Pippins creation, but Pippin is one of Schwartz's nicest score.  And the opening number, Magic To Do, is a Broadway classic (which is why I wonder why it didn't make it into Fosse).
If you collect Broadway Musicals, Pippin is a great addition to your collection.  It is a close replication of the Broadway production and it worth having.",1017705600,43,1689,4.501639344262295

Although the cast included in the filmed versions are not all the originals (especially missing John Rubenstein), the treatment is still strong and the songs transcend the genre.  Who'd ever think Broadway would embrace a nusical about Charlemagne's son set in the Middle Ages?  I loved it on stage and its great to revisit again on DVD.",1005091200,,577,4.797979797979798
486545,2,6302595770,"Pippin is the story of a young man searching for total fulfillment in life. Having seen it live 4 times (both professional and dinner theater) I love the story and the script.
But this video is strictly bush league. Poor video and sound quality make it look amateurish, despite the all-star cast. (Ben Vareen, William Katt, and the ensemble are great.) I swear, the video quality was so bad that my daughter walked in the room and asked if this was a home video of a local production. Editting problems between cameras make it obvious that this was filmed over several nights, or badly cut in the finishing room (cast member body positions change between shots and then return again, songs appear badly lip synced, despite the ""live"" stage setting in front of an audience, etc.) Scenes are jerky, with one jarring splice of Fastrada and Louis obviously re-recorded and cut into place just prior to ""Spread a Little Sunshine.""
I was also a little disappointed with the scenes cut and songs revised from the original production. ""War Is A Science"" is greatly cut back, the role of Katherine and the beautiful scenes with her son and his duck are all but missing, and the battle scenes that play out behind the Lead Player during Glory are not present. Also missing is one of the most memorable scenes from the stage, in which Pippin questions the value of war and the meaning of life with the disembodied head of a Visigoth (the scene was set up pretty obviously with cameras focusing on the head, but was apparently not included in the final edit.)
If you love Pippin and need a video to help rekindle memories of the play, this will do fine. If you are new to the show, this will leave you wondering what all the fuss was about 25+ years ago. Personally, I wish I had not spent the money. I went away remembering how good the stage production was, instead of having happy thoughts about having this film in my collection.",996883200,29,1921,4.587209302325581

Parts of ""War Is a Science"" were put back in, totally missing from the tape version. The song (as well as the show) is still incomplete on this version, but it's likely the most complete issue of this ground-breaking show we'll ever see.
Performance wise, you couldn't ask for more from Ben Vareen, William Katt, and Chita Rivera, all of whom give exciting performances captured here for all-time. Christopher Chadman, who plays the egotistical Lewis, brother of Pippin, went on to have a successful career as a Broadway choreographer before his untimely death. And it's great to see Martha Raye playing a role on stage since most of our memories of her are from dated 1940's movies that emphasize her brashness and not her humanity.
The most disappointing aspect of this DVD was its sound quality. The ""surround"" sound as digitized through my receiver muffled the singing and emphasized the orchestra. I found that sending the sound through the side speakers made the singing much clearer and less problematic.
The interview with Bob Fosse by critic/video producer David Sheehan isn't long on substance, but it's great to see this theater and film icon again in interviews not seen before.

And, unfortunately, the cameramen must not have thought too highly of Fosse's choreography because they cut away from it as much as possible to facial closeups.  Also, the audio is horrible. On the bigger cast numbers, it actually 'blows out' on group notes.  As for quality of filming and DVD presentation, this is an awful disc... But -- for those who love live theater, it's still a record of an interesting show with great performances by Vereen, Rivera, and Raye.  It's definitely not a kid-appropriate piece, however.

thankful that this record of the show is available. To have the
marvelous performance of Ben Vereen, the magnificant Chita Rivera,
funny Martha Raye and a surprisingly good performance by William Katt
on one DVD are reasons enough to have this recording. BUT the main
reason to treasure it is that it preserves Bob Fosse's staging and
choreography which would otherwise be lost. Yes, the staging is
recreated by Kathryn Doby, but she was Fosse's assistant for the
Broadway production, so short of Mr. Fosse himself, who better to do
it. (No one objects to Ann Reinking recreating Fosse's choreography
for the current smash revival of ""Chicago"".) One definite
plus for this production is that many of the dancers were in the
original Broadway production so knew just what Mr. Fosse had created
for them. I know as I checked my programs.
Admittedly, there are a
few cuts in the ""book"" and one song is omitted, but they all
work for the betterment of the show. If anyone remembers the original
Broadway reviews, the book was looked on as less than satisfying. The
version now on tape seems a much better one. I am comparing it to my
rememberance of the original Broadway show and the printed
script.
How often are live productions with an audience available?
Normally they are done in a studio and not on stage. Let's face it,
Broadway shows are meant for viewing by a live audience and to have
the reactions on this DVD makes you feel more a part of the
show.
Other productions with different directors will have a
completely different idea of the show, but they will fail to realize
that ""Pippin"" was shaped and basically created by Bob Fosse
and any other versions just can't do justice to the work.
I would
like to correct one comment that states that Florence Klotz
was responsible for the costumes. As good as her work is, she did not
design ""Pippin"", the wonderful Patricia Zipprodt did.
To sum it all
up, anyone who loves live musical theater should have this DVD (or

Then, some years later, the video came out, and I got to see it while on a cross-country flight. Unfortunately, the sound was messed up on the tape, and the crew cut the tape short, but even with that, there was something missing to the production.
It wasn't until I got a copy of the tape some years after that that I realized what was wrong: scenes deleted, dance numbers abridged... sure, it was Pippin, but at the same time it really wasn't. It was like this bad photocopy of a truly great original.
Still, it's better than nothing. I broke down and bought the DVD because (1) the quality was better than the tape, and (2) it ain't much, but it's a record of a show I hold very, very dear.
(BTW: Pippin trivia -- when Florence Klotz was on her way to show the original costume designs to Fosse, she got up too late that morning to put any colour into the chorus designs and decided to leave them white and beige washes -- she told herself en route that she would talk Fosse through the colour work and everything would be fine.

And I never hesitate for just a second to answer: Pippin, with Ben Vereen. Hands down.

From what Ive heard  he was a theatrical wunderkind, a human dynamo defying all manner of physical and logical constraint to deliver an absolutely inconceivable performance. I have only the CD cast recording to attest, which is good, but cannot possibly convey the magnitude of Vereens incomparable work as the Leading Player (an entry point role written by choreographer Bob Fosse to supplement Stephen Schwartz and Roger Hirsons good but prosaic book and music).

But I have the next best thing. Vereen returned in 1981 to reprise his role for a Canadian TV presentation, and it is this version that was released to VHS in the 80s and DVD in the 00s. This is not only the only recording of Vereen in Pippin but the only recording of Pippin period, and so I cherish this document with every fiber of my being! This is a MUST SEE for any fan of Fosse or Vereen, for any fan of musical theater, for any dancer for anyone period! Unlike most musicals, every single song is a winner, and the theme  about a man striving for fulfillment but realizing life is all about compromise  is just as relevant now as it was in the hippie, find-yourself early 70s.

The lyrics (when I could hear them) were a little better.  The dialogue made me think of some would-be wit writing trenchant comments about politics on his blog.  The whole thing was pretentious and untalented.  I mean by that the book and the songs.  Not Fosse or the actors.  The moral of the story (it's a morality play) is only one man's opinion, and  I don't agree.  The apparent climax before the finish and the sex scene and the anti-war scene were also fantastic.  Every so often, one of the characters in the show would call what they were doing a ""musical comedy"".  That also was one man's opinion!  I really liked the guy who played the king.  I was disappointed in Chit Rivera (who I love) and especially Martha Raye who I also love.  I thought she was coasting on her popularity, not playing her part.  This was supposed to be Ben Vereen's big hit.  I can see that if he'd had better things to do.  Pippin was best (more alive, made me feel something) when he broke character and was himself.  The filming and recording of the show fortunately were perfect.",1497571200,,1348,4.394308943089431
