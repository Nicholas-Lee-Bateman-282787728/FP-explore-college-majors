1981849,4,B00019G4OQ,"My niece loves it when I read the book ""Corduroy"" to her and since receiving the movie for her 4th birthday she watches it incessantly.  It's a wonderful story and a wholesome video choice for a little girl.",1200096000,3,207,4.447368421052632
1981850,5,B00019G4OQ,"We had Corduroy on VHS when I was little. We used to put it on when it was raining or needed to be entertained. We watched so intently - Mum loved it because we went dead quiet from the moment it went on - listening and watching intently.

Time passed, we grew up, moved out of home, got married, then the pitter patter of tiny feet. We asked Mum to pull out Corduroy to show the next generation ... and she had to admit that she'd lent it to a friend who had accidentally taped over it!

I searched for it on the net and could only find this version. From the cover I thought it was a cartoon version but figured it was better than nothing so ordered it. When it arrived, we put it in the DVD player crossing our fingers that it would have some of the magic of the original. We held our breath ... and were delighted; it was the original 1986 version of Corduroy!!

As for the other stories? Just icing on the cake!

This DVD is a must for any kids (and grown up kids) collection!",1178755200,7,981,4.067357512953368
1981851,5,B00019G4OQ,I'm a special ed teacher for K-1 and my students love these videos.  They add a visual depth to these classic stories.  Don't forget to view the extras and you can also have the words displayed as well.  I find them invaluable for illuminating literature.  Most stories are no more than 7-10 minutes long and so are great for getting students involved quickly. Well worth the price.  Students ask for them over and over again. Get the books too and students begin to engage with the books and get excited keeping up with the video.,1172361600,5,531,4.5473684210526315
1981852,2,B00019G4OQ,My daughter only watches the corduroy story but not the bonus stories. She is only familiar with the illustrated version of corduroy and was hoping to see curduroy interacting with his buddies from the books we have. She loves the very hungry caterpillar and watches it often.,1151971200,,276,4.8936170212765955
1981853,3,B00019G4OQ,"Loved the classic Corduroy story, Yo, Yes and Here Comes the Cat.  However, I was very disappointed with the bonus story.  The story, The Rainbabies is very disturbing and extremely inappropriate for children.  It frightened my daughter.",1146182400,,237,5.351351351351352
1981874,5,B00019G4OQ,Good condition and good shows! I look forward to ordering more scholastic DVDs...I'm glad that I can let my kids watch anytime!,1397606400,,127,4.818181818181818
1981875,5,B00019G4OQ,My granddaughter loves the story and wanted the video. I had the vcr edition years ago when teaching kindergarden. The extras are a bonus.,1385856000,,138,4.791666666666667
1981876,5,B00019G4OQ,My grandchildren just love this video and bring their Teddy bears to watch it with them.  I was delighted to find it available for purchase.,1380672000,,140,4.6
1981877,5,B00019G4OQ,"This is one of my favorite travel videos. My kids are 10, 7, and 3.  Since we have had it since my oldest (now 10) was a 3, so even though it's ""too young"" for him, he still enjoys seeing it with his younger siblings in the car.  It is comforting in its familiarity.  I like it because it doesn't grate on my nerves and I don't have to worry about the 3 year old getting distressed.  They laugh like crazy when Corduroy ends up on the train.  The rest isn't really funny (except parts of Here Comes the Cat), but is calming.  (Which is why some reviewers said ""boring."") The first 3 stories are all especially great for travel because none really rely on dialogue, so even on an airplane with terrible acoustics or for a 2 year old who doesn't like to wear headphones, this is a good DVD.  Four stories I remember off-hand: Corduroy, Yo! Yes?, Here Comes the Cat, and Rain Babies.  54 minutes total.",1380240000,2,899,4.27810650887574
1981878,4,B00019G4OQ,Oldie but a goodie - loved this story as a child & now my kids can enjoy it too. Very hard to find this DVD but glad I persisted.,1372809600,2,129,3.4827586206896552
1981879,5,B00019G4OQ,"Corduroy is a great movie to show to 2-4 yr olds.  The old fashion style of entertainment will trance your child.  The little bear moves throughout the store in the middle of the night, looking for his button.  Love it!",1360540800,,219,4.425
1981880,2,B00019G4OQ,I like to get vhs that follow the books. Not really a good one.  I was disappointed.  I thought this would be animated or follow the artwork from the book. Skip it.  Get the book & read to your child.,1324080000,,200,3.95
1981881,5,B00019G4OQ,"This is one of the best of the Scholastic DVD collections.  Corduroy is a live action film made in the 70s I believe.  A little girl finds the bear of her dreams but he is missing a button so the bear spends the night trying to find one.  The film is very nicely done and effective.  The other stories are very well done too.  Here Comes the Cat! is an animated film which is fun to watch.  The Rainbabies is a wonderful book I've never even heard of before but I will look for it.  Everything about this DVD is wonderful.  Sharp pictures, good sound and the stories are great.",1222473600,2,577,4.181818181818182
1981882,1,B00019G4OQ,I LOVED the book of Corderoy as a child and thought this DVD would be great for my 2-year-old son.  It's not a cartoon but a live action movie. It is completely and utterly BORING.  My son actually started yawning in the middle of it.  And the other stories on the DVD are no better.  Save your money and get Chicka-Chicka Boom Boom or Harry the Dirty Dog.  Both have all great stories and songs.,1213660800,2,396,4.226666666666667
1981883,1,B00019G4OQ,"How is it possible to turn a delightfully illustrated children's classic into a cheesy, live-action '80s DVD with absolutely none of the charm, or even the basic premise, of the original? It would have been so easy to just copy what the book did.  This is an absolutely dreadful dramatization of a wonderful children's book.  It's a horrible conception from start to finish - first, why not animate (or at least use the book's terrific illustrations)? Then, why alter a wonderful story, and add cheesy cartoonish action? The Corduroy bear could have had a cute voice and at the very least repeated the lines from the book.  Instead, he is frankly like a horror-film bear -- he had my husband and me laughing and groaning, at the same time.  My son, a huge Corduroy fan, lost interest after the first minute.

Scholastic, shame on you for letting this dreck muck up your prestigious reputation.  It's not worthy of the title Corduroy, let alone the brand Scholastic.",1209513600,2,965,4.783132530120482
8008542,5,B00019G4OQ,"My daughters (ages 3 and 5) love this movie, and want to watch it over and over. Perfect for little ones interested in movies.",1511136000,,126,4.291666666666667
8008543,2,B00019G4OQ,"I was disappointed that this was Not the animated version, though that is what they show on the cover. My 3.5 year old was not impressed watching ""real people"" portray this fabulous book.",1509494400,,187,4.696969696969697

8008551,5,B00019G4OQ,Darling video of Corduroy.  Corduroy comes to life and has misadventures as he hides from the security guard.  This is not animated.  I showed it many times as a teacher and am very pleased to see the same video to show my granddaughter.  She loved it!,1413331200,,252,4.413043478260869
