7823596,4,6302286247,"The ghost of Don Juan comes back from the grave to visit the theater, where the villagers are doing a play about him.  He's also back to have a few quick thrills with the ladies.  Meanwhile the stage actor who plays Don  Juan in the play is running around the town naked.  It's a riot.  The  opening flamenco scene is riveting.  The characters are all crazy and  outrageous.  It's jubilant, erotic, surreal, but mostly hilarious.  Don't  miss this gem.
