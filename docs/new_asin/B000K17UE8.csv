8502812,4,B000K17UE8,"Overall this tape is rather boring until the last match--the 1993 Raw Ric Flair vs. Mr. Perfect loser leaves the WWF match that appeared in edited form on the new Best of Raw 15th Anniversary DVD. The dvd edited the match down to 12 minutes, while the tape has the complete 20 minute segment (minus the original commercial interuptions).
 Other matches include:
Savage vs. Terry Taylor
Undertaker vs. Berzerker
Shawn Michaels vs. Virgil
Bret Hart vs. Kamala
Money Inc. vs. Nasty Boys
plus other matches featuring ""stars"" of the era like Bossman, High Energy, Crush, Papa Shango, Earthquake, IRS and Repo Man.",1201564800,,608,4.96078431372549
