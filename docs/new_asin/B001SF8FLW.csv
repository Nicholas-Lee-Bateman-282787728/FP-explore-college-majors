3785466,5,B001SF8FLW,"Those of us fortunate enough to have bared witness to the career of this amazing artist since the beginning, know we have been and continue to be in the presence of absolute one-of-a-kind greatness.  Those that haven't and think they know and have heard greatness, you can't even imagine.

Even if one isn't into this genre of music, you owe it to yourself to purchase this DVD and experience some of what so many of us have had the pleasure of for what's approaching now 50 years!  I tell you, you will become magnificently enlightened because there's been no other vocalist to date that can come close.  Yes, she IS that much better than any other.

You will hear the message in every song, every expression.  A message of truth and passion from an artist who must have been inside the heart of every songwriter whose songs she has interpreted through her soul and her magnificent vocal instrument.  There can be no other answer to how she is able to convey the depth and meaning of a song, all the while commanding you to listen to the lyrics and feel the meaning the way the composer had intended, and all without you even realizing it.  You will find yourself waiting to exhale after every powerful note, but the greatest power is in her ability to deliver a note so softly, so gently, as nearly a whisper--it will leave you breathless.  I'm sorry, but you don't need to scream and high-power through every song to show you can sing, like so many today.  The true artistry is in the nuances, the subtleties.

I recommend this DVD to anyone truly interested in having your heart and soul, not just your ears, entertained.  And when you're done with this magnificent selection, treat yourself to Streisand from the beginning, from Funny Girl through the years to this piece of work . . . then you too will understand what millions of us have been experiencing for nearly five decades, and why we feel we have been in the 'presence of true greatness'.",1240790400,56,1953,4.580459770114943
3785467,5,B001SF8FLW,"I was there, in 2006: Barbra in Las Vegas.
And again in 2007, in Berlin, Dublin and London.
Four wonderful concerts - and finally the DVD is here. It's everything I hoped for - and more. Barbra's simply brilliant: she's in great voice, sings songs she hasn't sung in ages and is very, very relaxed: she really seems to be enjoying herself.
This (Florida)concert is very close to what I saw in Vegas and Europe. The Bush skit is missing - many people don't mind, but I would have loved to have seen it here - even as a bonus.
The quality of this DVD is amazingly good. it has been shot in HD/widescreen and it shows. Both the picture and audio look and sound great, although this version of the concert is completely blown out of the water by the Blu-ray edition - but that's a different story.

Highly recommended - for the casual fan, the hard-core fan (like me) and anyone who simply enjoys great music - and a great performance.

Oh - and the Anaheim '94 disc, plus the bonus Making of the Broadway Album are more than icing on the cake. The Anaheim show features one of Barbra's greatest performances ever, while The Broadway album is one of Streisand's top albums - ever!

3785470,5,B001SF8FLW,"Wow!! Incredible New Streisand concert on bluray. I was tired of waitng for the American release and not getting it till sometime in JULY (due to the television special) and Yep there are edits here and there but thats  nothing new or unordinary, try to forget the process and just enjoy this great Musical presentation. For some reason Amazon UK says its only region 2 but that is not true, several of us in the USA with USA blu ray players played the Europe disc & it works just fine , it is region free. Ive had several people, friends and family members say how this concert is different, Barbra is carefree, funnier and more of an actress in her songs,shes not so serious or a perfectionist like in the past, Shes like a kid again kicking off her shoes and kicking up her legs, singing songs she wouldnt touch before like Stoney End and Woman in the Moon, Barbra Amazes again A+",1239235200,14,883,4.41717791411043
3785471,4,B001SF8FLW,"a concert filled with wonderful moments. I also rushed to get the UK version with all 3 discs region free and pal, playable on US DVD player and flat TV. Although the concert 2006 DVD is the first Streisand concert DVD in 16:9 format, the picture quality is a bit disappointing. Movement and resolution could be better. Wonder if it was shot in HD. I did enjoy very much the DTS 5.1 mix though. DVD2 is similar in quality to the previous release of the MGM show.",1238716800,,462,4.32183908045977
3785472,5,B001SF8FLW,"I bought this recently from Amazon UK since I did not want to wait till June. The concert is amazing. The high def of Blu-Ray is awesome!! The only thing I have to comment on is that I believe some of the big notes have been doctored to make Barbra sound better. Having owned the CD of the same concert for two years now I am quite aware of the fact that this concert doesn't show Barbra in the best voice of her career. To give her credit she is 65, and Barbra Streisand on a bad day is still better than most other singers out there.

The DVD version seems to have the flaws corrected. Don't get me wrong, I like this. But at the end of ""Somewhere"" during the big last note, Barbra's microphone is nowhere near her mouth and she's still in mid-note. Definitely embelished. But like I said, it's probably 98% undoctored. And I'd definitely recommend it to any Barbra fan.",1238630400,12,872,4.284848484848485
3785473,5,B001SF8FLW,"The Concerts DVD documents another milestone in Barbra's career.

2006 is simply Streisand at 64. Fresh. Surprising. Intimate. Silly. Supreme. After a dozen viewings I'm thinking this is Barbra's greatest concert recording.

If you 'GET' Barbra, get the 2006 concert asap. I'm not giving any spoilers, keep the surprise for yourself.

My copy arrived from Amazon-UK mid March - who could wait? The inclusion of the '94 Anaheim Concert and Putting It Together (the making of the Broadway Album) makes this a must have set. The three UK discs are region free and PAL.",1237507200,29,565,4.98936170212766

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: A singularly impressive concert film, a record of Barbra Streisand's 2006 tour and shot mainly during performances in Sunrise, Florida. Barbra Streisand features a phenomenal late-career performance by the singer-actress and sometimes-director, while the film of the event is co-directed by Barbra Streisand as well and is both intimate and epic, capturing the excitement and synergy between artist and audience exceptionally well. The Blu-ray disc is also impressive, with excellent video and audio, some good extra features, and well-designed menu screens. The show, also known as 'Streisand: Live in Concert 2006' was broadcast April 25 on CBS; this network airing apparently is the reason behind why the Blu-ray's delay in the U.S.

'STREISAND: Live in Concert 2006' is an ideal venue, and ideally suited to the uniquely talented diva. Barbra Streisand clearly is feeding off her fans and in return she gives them one of the best performances of her career. Sixty-four at the time, her voice is still strong if throatier (she still hits those amazing high notes on ""People"") and her interpretation of the songs' lyrics has the kind of maturity that can only come with age. Barbra Streisand herself jokes about getting older, though she looks great.

The programme opens with the Overture from 'Funny Girl' while onscreen there's a montage of the stage being set-up, and there are brief interviews with excited fans entering the area. (An older couple who saw her perform ""Happy Days Are Here Again"" when she was 17 wonder if she'll perform it again that evening. She does.) There's also a pretty incredible montage of Big Name celebrities arriving to watch the show (Oprah, Tony Bennett, Stephen Sondheim, Tom Hanks, Bill and Hillary Clinton, etc.) including a brief glimpse of Barbra Streisand's actor-husband, James Brolin.

The stage, intended to resemble a smoky nightclub, apparently, is an odd jumble of railings and platforms and it looks like where they keep the tractor beam on the Death Star, or maybe the kind of labyrinthine line you have to go through to get to those E-ticket rides at Disneyland. Barbra Streisand is backed by a full orchestra conducted by her arranger, Bill Ross. The multinational, operatic pop vocal quartet Il Divo is featured on a couple of songs, but otherwise Barbra Streisand dominates, as well she should. The show is a pleasant mixture of Barbra Streisand hits ""The Way We Were"" and ""Evergreen"" and popular standards ""Come Rain or Come Shine,"" ""Smile"" and ""What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?"" and songs popularised by others or in other media like ""The Music of the Night"" from Phantom of the Opera.

Barbra Streisand sings an excellent ""Ma Premiere Chanson,"" which she co-wrote and confidently performs in French, which I loved with her Je m'appelle Barbra Streisand CD Album, one of her few non-hits. The charmingly goofy ""Stoney End,"" first introduced by Peggy Lipton and apparently something of a cult tune with Streisand fans, is sung during an amusing Q&A break with the audience. The show makes reference to Streisand's activism, though the Blu-ray eliminates entirely a comedy sketch featuring Steve Bridges as George W. Bush. Though it drew a mixed (if mostly positive) reaction from the audience, it's still a shame that it's not included here.

As a songstress, Barbra Streisand really comes alive by ""Evergreen,"" offering an excellent interpretation of ""Come Rain or Come Shine"" and a heartfelt ""Funny Girl,"" a performance I found vastly superior to the one she did in the 1967 film. ""Unusual Way"" is another brilliant standout, maybe the best in the show. Throughout the performance, Barbra Streisand is funny and charming, humbled by the warm reception given her. As co-director of the concert film, she strikes just the right balance of song and conversation, of intimacy with her audience, of knowing when to cut away to them reacting her singing, and of knowing when to play with a song and when to leave it alone and allow its melody and lyrics to work its total magical performance.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The 1080p high-definition encoded image displays a really extremely good quality picture. As with other concert titles in high-definition, being able to see so much more detail and such a wider colour palette, to be able to read the myriad faces in the crowd, to study the orchestra, and to see deep into the eyes of Barbra herself, reading her every emotion, adds an immediacy that the inferior NTSC DVD just cannot provide. The different levels of black can be delineated and combined with the great texture detail makes clear the folds of the fabric in her gown. The gold sparkles and pops off the screen in contrast. The sparkling backdrop and lighting are vivid.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The audio is a knockout, with a varied selection of 5.1 LPCM Surround Sound, 2.0 LPCM Stereo and 5.1 Dolby Digital sound track. Optional English, French and Spanish subtitles are provided, but these only appear between songs; the songs themselves are not subtitled, possibly due to publishing restrictions. The menu screens are well-designed, and chapters take the viewer to specific song selections. The audio experience is immersive as the orchestra, the echo of her voice, and the audience ambiance puts the viewer in the canter of the action.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Bonus Colour Booklet: With this Blu-ray disc you get a really beautiful 8 page booklet that contains different contents, which read as follows: THE CONCERT: Here you get the full listings of the tracks and the bonus extras. IF NOT NOW, WHEN?: Here we get very informative information by Jay Landers [2007] on different comments about what was observed at the different locations of the Live in Concert in 2006. BARBRA: A PORTRAIT: Here we get Jay Landers [2006] talking about why Jay Landers is a massive fan of Barbra Streisand and you get three sections divided into the following headings: ORIGINAL adj; GENIUS noun and ETERNAL adj. Plus there are lots of colourful photos relating to the 2006 Concert.

Finally, fans of Barbra Streisand should definitely take a look at this very attractively priced Blu-ray release. 'STREISAND: Live in Concert 2006' is a really lovely joyous concert film that I am convinced you will enjoy immensely. The Blu-ray disc, courtesy of Universal Music, sounds good and looks terrific. If you have never seen Barbra Streisand before, here is your chance to experience one of the greatest artists of all-time perform. She looks great, sounds great, and proves that she still knows how to thrill a crowd. This is one special night of music to relive over and over, up close and personal, possibly even taking the place of seeing her from a bad seat faraway, at least you get up close and personal. I cannot recommend this enough. Highly Recommended!

It is handsomely packaged in a 3-dvd set plus a booklet,  describing what lovely things you will experience while listening to the music. Even though i knew Ms. Streisand was older, i was surprised to find that her voice has lost little of its fantastic range or power.  In the 2006 concert, she seems to truly enjoy pleasing her audience, as well as in the other discs, where she shares stories about her youth, even photos of herself as a teenager.  There is a wide range of her music as well, from show tunes to ballads, to songs she has made famous in movies, even including a couple of songs she herself has written, performed, and made famous.  One disc also includes the process required to put an album together, which i found fascinating. It seemed to me she put her very heart into each and every song she chose for the album. For anyone who enjoys this genre' of music, for any Barbra Streisand fan, this set is a ""must-have!"" It is truly delightful! i have listened to it again and again, always looking forward to listening to it again!

It was an experience I will never forget. Probably the best experience of my life, and to think that right in the middle of DOWN WITH LOVE, there I am, with my arms extended up high cheering the best entertainer that ever lived. Thank you Miss Streisand, for letting me be part of your video, and part of that wonderful night in Sunrise, Florida where you more than raised the roof away of the BANKATLANTIC CENTER; I bet not even the Florida Panthers have caused such uproar in that venue in their entire franchise. 10/28/06 is a date for the record books in Florida and in my lifetime.",1319760000,,760,4.284722222222222
3785531,3,B001SF8FLW,"Well don't get me wrong I'm a big Barbra fan. The 2006 Live in concert is a wonderful show and it looks great, I also picked up the blu ray which I must say looks stunning. What I really wanted from here was the original Emmy winning concert special from 94. I already had the dvd of The Concert from the 93/94 Live at the MGM Grand which looked and sounded stunning on dvd (It was given a great new 5.1 Dolby Digital Mix) even though it was really only filmed for posterity and archival reasons as it was Barbra's return to the concert stage after 27 years. However, I was greatly dissapointed by the presentation of the original special. It looked liked it had just been dubbed from the VHS, even the laserdisc looked better. It sounds like they have just used the original AC3 Dolby Digital mix from the laserdisc. I was so looking forward to Peter Morse's beautiful lighting in the Lazy Afternoon sequence and a great sound mix, the Yentl medley and Somewhere would have been stunning as well. This concert was Barbra at her best and deserves a better presentation. I wonder if this special can be put on Blu Ray. I know for sure Timeless was filmed in HD so that can be put to blu ray, but in the early 90's I'm not so sure. Suggestion, either a full restoration of the special or hit the editing room and do it all again (Camera angels, audio remix etc) Oh one can only dream, Although Barbra says ""It's never finished you just have to hand it over"" So minus a star for this special, same goes for the Making of the Broadway album just a poor transfer. It's strange even the 60's Television specials look better.
Anybody have any thoughts?",1318464000,,1645,4.379084967320262

Hearing Barbra sing on a CD is one thing, watching her sing and seeing her interaction with the audience is another.  You feel like you are there!  I was thrilled to find that this concert had been recorded on a DVD.  Now I can enjoy it whenever I choose ... and not just to help  me sleep!  Barbra's voice is messmerizing.

For those of us who grew up with her work, it can bring a tear to your eye as you go down memory lane. She takes time to talk to laugh with the audience between songs. It's a nice way of letting new and old listeners get to know her. This could be the best and last ""Barbara"" concert ever recorded so I recommend getting this collection.

SHE'S A LEGEND....WHAT MORE COULD YOU SAY. HER VOICE ...SO BEAUTIFUL AND IN TOP FORM. YOU CAN FEEL THE EXCITEMENT IN THE AUDIENCE AND STAFF BEFORE THE SHOWS BEGIN....THIS WOMAN CAUSES A MAJOR STIR WHEN SHE PERFORMS....EVERYBODY THATS ANYBODY TURNS UP.

3785542,5,B001SF8FLW,"What a great DVD and in Blu-Ray.  I was taken in from the very first bars of the Funny Girl overature. The orchastra was terriffic, but first things first. First of all the blu-ray is fantastic, clean, crisp and the sound is great. You see Barbara up front and personal.

Barbara is a wonder. It shows her in a totally different light, relaxed, more human and touchable.  The voice is still there, intact and still a thing of beauty and with total control.  The voice has matured but its nice.  The songs she has sung for years take on an entirely different texture and meaning.  Just like Sinatra, the woman has lived a life and it is there in her music. I must say I loved every minute of it and was surprised that I would. I actually wanted more. Il Divo could have stayed home but it was ok.

I am a fan all over again.  I am searching on Amazon for CDs that I had on vinyl and have not heard in years. If you like Barbara this concert may make you love her, if you already love her, well then you most likely already own this DVD:)",1269993600,,1036,4.145

3785546,5,B001SF8FLW,"This is by far her best recorded concert thus far because you get to see and hear that young unguarded singer come out of Barbra at last. The set now that took some planning and the lighting, sound all were top notch here. The song list the best so far and the song arrangements brought new freshness to each song. Barbra at last on film is actually having fun performing live as a singer.  A very long road for her but I believe it took her other concerts live to get her to this point in her singing career...she grew as an artist...a singer in a live format. She did it and after watching this concert I can see bits of that same singer as I did in ""My Name Is Barbra"".  Streisand has come full circle for the music fans we are lucky she has returned to her music and continues to perform live. Next up that New York concert she did in the fall of 2009 again the singer is still branching out her musical roots. Barbra you now sing with soul, girl you can swing with the band oh yeah for that reason alone I got to see you once more I hope You and Diana Krall do a few dates together that would be a nice treat for all us Streisand fans (and Diana Krall fans too). Thanks for the music and sharing your gift live/concert. Luv ya, Dann 2/19/2010.  P.S.

With just a simple series of catwalks in the center of the arena with almost no props, Streisand proves she needs nothing but her fantastic interpretation of her classic pieces to hold an audience.

The audio options on this DVD are for Stereo or DTS Surround. On a Bose system you can not chose the DTS surround because the Bose system automatically enhances any Stereo or Dolby Digital to DTS. So, if you chose DTS when viewing you will hear nothing. You have to choose stereo or Dolby Digital (if available) Almost all DVD's have these options. So on this DVD, I would have to choose stereo under the audio, and than click a button on my Bose remote to convert to surround. When you do this it sound really good and not that much is lost. The problem is when I do this on this concert, the music is very thin sounding. You can hardly hear the drums, bass etc..I have never had this problem on any other DVD and I have loads of them.

3785578,3,B001SF8FLW,"Is it possible that Streisand is underrated? I'd say so, given her remarkable achievements of the years. But it's been a sad fact that her last great studio CD was The Broadway Album way back in 1985. Ever since then, she's been a perfectionist to a fault when recording an album, glossing over every imperfection with vocal take after take until the life is squeezed out of her performances. The exception has been in concert, where Streisand has to just stay in the moment. (I'm ignoring the likely possibility that she's fiddled with some of her concert releases after the fact.) In this DVD set, you get Streisand in marvelous voice both in 1994 and 2006, along with a third DVD devoted to her TV special about the making of The Broadway Album. Unlike many concert films, there is no frenetic editing here to create ""excitement."" The camerawork is perfunctory and the cuts random but not distracting -- they let the singing create the drama and Streisand doesn't disappoint. The next time she's recording an album, Streisand needs to treat it like a concert. Rehearse, prepare, then do it live in just a few takes.",1245369600,6,1118,4.7384615384615385

I went to the 1994 Concert at the Pond and was the lucky one who had tickets for her last concert in May that was cancelled due to laryngitis, the concert was rescheduled for July and happened to be the night HBO was filming her show for cable. I can still remember the excitement of the opening of the curtain and in walked Streisand. To see her was like seeing God come out (I am a big fan).

The Making of the Broadway Album I had on VHS and the Concert 2006 was phenomenal. To see Rosie (who actually was doing the View and was able to attend most of her concerts shows she a true fan, I still think Barbara Walters is two faced for kissing up to Rosie at the time and trashing her once she left, I haven't watched the show since) Hillary, Bill, Meg and Tom Hanks who actually were present at the Pond was exciting to see some look as good as they did then.

3785581,5,B001SF8FLW,"I was fortunate enough to see this 2006 concert live and very close to the stage.  I will never forget it.  Barbra seemed much more at ease at this concert than her prior concert in 2000 and it was a pleasure to see her enjoy herself.

Barbra sang a lot of different material in this concert.  And I truly think that what was said in the liner notes was true and that she only sang songs she loved, with the exception of ""Stoney End,"" which she sang in a staged question and answer session and the place practically exploded, to which she said she still doesn't understand the fascination with ""Stoney End.""

There were many songs in this concert that she had not sung since her very early career, some she hadn't sung since the Funny Girl days and some new songs that she included which are always a treat for any tride and true fan.

Her banter with Il Divo was fun and the way she weaved them into some of her songs was well choreographed.  Il Divo themselves put on a great performance and it was a nice ying to Barbra's yang.

This DVD set captures this concert very well and the additional footage that was included was much appreciated.  Barbra did not sing all of these songs at the concert I saw, so I was very happy to see her sing ""When the Sun Come Out,"" and was astonished that she sang ""Nobody's Heart,"" a song she hasn't performed in well over 40 years which sounded pretty much the same in terms of vocal quality.

The additional footage included on this DVD set was previously available, however, it's nice to have it on this collection as well.

I highly recommend this DVD for old and new Streisand fans alike, it's a great view into a fantastic artist and what could possibly be her last concert of this scale.  Who knows, maybe she'll take over for Bette and Cher in Vegas (one could only hope ;>)",1244764800,,1818,4.346153846153846

From the very first time she opened her mouth to sing, we have been blessed with this spectacular presence and this DVD proves her still, incredible talents.  From that moment at ""The Lion"" to this performance, she has proven over and over again that she is The Greatest Star.  She has given the world what only a few performers have been able to provide us with and to be in the same company as Ella, Judy, Frank and Tony is a feat not attainable by many.  She has earned the right to be labeled as one of the greatest performers of all time.  This DVD is a testament to her lasting power as a singer, actress, director and humanitarian.

3785604,5,B001SF8FLW,"This DVD collection is truly wonderful. I have been waiting so long to see the 2006 concert on DVD, and it is finally here! :-) Not a big production tour like her last 2 concerts. Barbra seems to do a concert every 6 years, and this one is just her singing, which is always great. No interactive screens, or sets, or stories with dramatic 'lead ins'. The 2006 concert is wonderful, Babra's voice is getting tired, you can hear that. However, her musicality and timing and energy is getting better with age, she is now a very nice vintage! Ill Divo are great. It is the best blending of voices to have them sing with Barbra. Music of the night is beautiful, and I love their version of 'Evergreen'. I could watch this DVD many many more times. And of course it is lovely to have the 1994 concert DVD as well. I didn't have this one before. it is also quite flawless. The documentary on the 3rd disc is great. Putting It Together: The Making of the Broadway Album is  exquisite. Nice to see Sydney Pollack on there. her old friend, speaking lines on the opening track. The clip of her doing the duet with Ray Charles is also a timeless treasure. the other clips of her singing are also important for any fan to have in their collection.

I think Barbra gets tired doing these shows, but her voice is still in top shape. The only thing that was a little 'not right' was her confession about her junk food eating habits, saying that she ate all this crap food before the show, - doesn't give a great picture of her i must say. Also my initial feeling about having the dog come out and sit with her when she sang her final number was that it's a bit much! And then the dog started running away, and she kind of went after it, and almost forgot to keep singing the next line of the song... i thought she was about to dissapear down the stairs with it!!! Anyway, i can forgive her for that. Just seemed a little strange is all.
 Buy this collection. It's a wonder!!

PS It's very interesting to see the little doco about he Streisand Foundation. I was very impressed with the things she does with donating money to causes all across America. Go Babs! :-)",1243382400,,2147,4.320099255583126
3785605,5,B001SF8FLW,This set of 3 DVD's were an amazing value. 2 concerts and one documentary about the making of one of her albums. Barbra is so awesome and her voice is as beautiful as ever. The first concert was over 2 hours and kept me entertained every minute. The plus was that her son was in the audience and she sang a song directly to him. Simply wonderful.

3785611,4,B001SF8FLW,"As someone who's been a fan of Ms. Streisand for a significant number of years, what I've come to appreciate about her is the consistent quality but striking difference between each of her live shows.  Her latest effort, so well documented on this DVD, continues that tradition.  I saw this show at the Boston venue, but have really enjoyed re-living it and discovering new elements in the south Florida program.  Barbra seems so much more relaxed and at ease, no longer relying on over-the-top technological innovations like the past 2 concerts and instead, offering a host of rarely heard or never-before-performed songs that really showcase her talents.  Audience connection and interaction seems to be at an all-time high as well!  No longer is she only connecting with her celebrity friends or high-profile family, but actually dialoguing with fans seated throughout the arena.  And seeing her seem to completely ""let go"" and high-kick throughout one section of ""Don't Rain On My Parade"" is completey priceless.  (As is her short version of ""Stoney End.""  Don't miss it!)",1242950400,,1076,5.1085714285714285
3785612,4,B001SF8FLW,"I suppose this gay man is biased or maybe im stupid, bu this performance taped in Fort Lauderdale Fl on her 2006 tour is far more satisfying to me than her 1994 concert. I like her conncetion with the auduence here.",1242777600,2,215,4.2682926829268295
3785613,5,B001SF8FLW,"Funny girl, funny lady, and now--funny grandma.  Barbra's back, looking pleasingly plump and with a golden voice that sounds as sensual as ever.  For those who lament that she can't hit or hold the high notes as she once did, all I can say is, ""And how are you doing in your mid-60s?""  If you want a sampling of the young Barbra, this DVD has extras from her TV shows for you to enjoy.

The amazing thing about Barbra, aside from that God-given voice of hers, is how beautifully she's aged.  She's really grown into her ""look,"" and she's far more attractive than many of yesterday's glamour girls who are now in their 60s and 70s.

The highlight for me in this elegant, gorgeously produced concert is Barbra's delivery of ""Have I Stayed Too Long at the Fair?""  With its special lyrics saluting her mother and father, I truly felt that she was saying goodbye to her amazing career.  It was joyous and sad at the same time.  There never will be another like her.

On the downside, I'm always a bit uncomfortable when Barbra shmoozes with her audience.  This has been billed as the warmer, friendlier, ""looser"" Barbra.  I don't know why but I never really believe it.  And there's quite a bit of it in this concert.

But don't let that deter you from this exceptional DVD of her performance.  The sound, the lighting, the set are a true pleasure.  And Barbra's impeccable diction and heartfelt interpretations draw you into her songs as if each were a little play.  Just watch her eyes as she sings.  She really feels every word of the lyrics.

A footnote that may be of interest:  The name of the actor who played George W. Bush in the much-discussed political skit appears in the credits.  Thankfully, the skit is missing.  Was it a last-minute decision?  We'll never know but it was a wise move.  Why date this extraordinary performance?  For those who get off on Barbra's politics, you can hear all the gags on the bonus tracks.",1242432000,2,1929,4.537790697674419
3785614,4,B001SF8FLW,"Especially interesting is the newer concert where Streisand is very relaxed and all about the music. Unfortunately, her voice has deepened and the wild ride slightly out of control upper register thrills are gone. I think the best moment is just Babs and the piano and 'Nobody's Heart'. She does a good job with 'My Shining Hour' but it's a shame she didn't record it when her voice was at its peak.
On the whole, very enjoyable.",1242172800,2,429,4.584415584415584
3785625,5,B001SF8FLW,"Sublime...Stunning....Sexy.....Sonorous....Superb.....SIMPLY STREISAND of course!

At 64 and still able to perform and SING like she does.....well the likes of her just do not exist anymore nor I'm afraid ever will.

She remains an original artist to her fingertips ......and all at her age and still in total control of her magnificent talents.  We are blessed that she is alive & well and still in near-prime condition.  The fun she appears to be having is apparent in her banter with the adoring audience, her funny expressions and dialogue with Il Divo (they are simply dreadful & thank GOD we can just skip over their musical numbers!!) and her simply stunning Don't Rain on My Parade, where she is skipping & hopping like a little girl all in her bare, stocking feet!

Yes, the VOICE is not what it was 10 years earlier, and the keys are lower, but how it has aged......smoky & deep yet still able to climax a song like no other....I'm finding more emotions in how she expresses the meaning of a lyric.....My Man.....Have I Stayed Too Long at the Fair.....People.....The Way We Were......and capping it off with a most exquisite rendition of Smile, probably the most moving version since Garland's.

Yes, this concert is heavily  ""produced"" in terms of photography/sound design, lighting, staging, etc.,.......but Barbra is the last of the classic glamorous Hollywood stars and of course she would want her (most probable) final live performance in pristine condition for posterity and the ages to view.

This woman's phenomenal body of work in every genre she's touched is astonishing and this concert is a significant and much valued addition.

Oh, did I forget to mention my personal fav?  The soft & lyrical Nobody's Heart Belongs to Me where her voice is so pure & gentle...then followed directly with a SLAM!  BAM!  rendition of Arlen's When the Sun Comes Out where Streisand holds nothing back, belting out as only she can this number first recorded by her in 1963!!!

Beautiful Barbra......Beautiful.

Her relationship with her fans has grown and it is very noticable!!!! I also think that the live perfomance of My Man in the 2006 concert is the ABSOLUTE best she has ever sang the song live!!

3785631,5,B001SF8FLW,"Back in 1991, Barbra Streisand released a four-disc CD set,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Just-for-the-Record/dp/B00009VU2M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Just for the Record...</a>, chronicling her first thirty years in show business through rare audio clips, album tracks, recording outtakes, and periodically her bona fide hits. There was talk of a video version that never came to pass, which makes this a particularly fitting consolation prize - especially since now nearly two additional decades have elapsed.

This three-disc DVD set captures Streisand at three points in her storied career. Disc One contains the Ft. Lauderdale stop in her mega-successful Fall 2006 tour, which was as much a commemoration of her nearly half-century career as it was a cause clbre for her renowned liberal causes via her foundation. Disc Two has her last stop in Anaheim during her much-heralded 1994 concert tour - her first in 27 years, while Disc Three documents the recording sessions behind her acclaimed 1985 back-to-her-roots CD,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Broadway-Album/dp/B00005V3XG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Broadway Album</a>. This last one starts with a fast-cut montage of her early-to-mid-career TV and film performances, which lends a nice bookend to her astounding five decades of performing.

The centerpiece is the beautifully photographed 2006 concert (*****). I was fortunate to be present at the San Jose stop two weeks later in her tour, and at an impossibly youthful 64, Streisand looked resplendent as proven on this disc. Granted her lower register has developed a burnished throatiness and some of her more precocious high notes escape her now, but the lustrous glow of her voice is still very much in evidence. The melisma and dramatic conviction remain unparalleled, as she remains a willful force of nature based on a most singular persona, and easily the most accomplished song stylist of her generation. This disc represents a wonderful remembrance of that evening, as well as a pristine document of a beautifully turned performance for those who missed it.

The event is not the therapeutic exercise in self-introspection like Streisand's previous comebacks. Given how many more audience reaction shots are included here, she is far more relaxed with her stage patter and with her political conscience on relatively limited display. Played by a 58-piece orchestra, the opening is a rousing rendition of the Broadway overture from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Funny-Girl/dp/B000002SNJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Funny Girl</a>, which leads to Streisand's enthusiastically greeted entrance as she sonorously sings her long-ago stand-by, ""Starting Here, Starting Now"". She makes a comically studied attempt at the piano to re-introduce us to her first composition, the very Gallic-flavored ""Ma Premiere Chanson"" (which in hindsight, sounds very much like ""Lost Inside of You"" from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Star-Is-Born/dp/B00005V3XL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Star Is Born</a>).

Many of her fan favorites were expected and are accounted for here by necessity - ""People"", ""Don't Rain on My Parade"", ""The Way We Were"", ""What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?"" - with the arrangements almost the same as the recorded versions but with her immaculate professionalism still making them sound fresh. There is a decidedly sentimental ""Funny Girl"" medley in which she sings the title song and ""My Man"" from the film version, as well as the torchy ballad, ""The Music That Makes Me Dance"", from the Broadway version. The second disc contains welcome additions to her repertoire - Maury Yeston's wistful ""Unusual Way"" from the musical&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nine/dp/B0000996FQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nine</a>; Harold Arlen's WWII-era chestnut, ""My Shining Hour""; and a galloping take on Rodgers and Hammerstein's ""A Cockeyed Optimist"" from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/South-Pacific/dp/B00000DHSL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">South Pacific</a>&nbsp;combined fittingly with an excerpt from William Saroyan's ""The Time of Your Life"".

Songs from her early performing years are sprinkled throughout - a smoky nightclub version of ""Down With Love"", the poignantly evocative ""(Have I Stayed) Too Long at the Fair?"" appropriately twirling her chair when she mentioned the merry-go-around, and of course, her signature song, the slow-tempo version of ""Happy Days Are Here Again"". The unsubtle bombast of the stentorian popera group, Il Divo, has been thankfully toned down from the CD on three ensemble tracks, but their scripted patter still comes across as contrived. A nice surprise, however, is the Q&A session where she takes questions on cards submitted by the audience, answers them with her trademark wit and chutzpah, and even sings a truncated version of ""Stoney End"". The concert ends appropriately with her touching rendition of Charlie Chaplin's ""Smile"" with a guest appearance by her much-beloved dog Sammie.

There are five bonus performance tracks - a wonderful throwback to Streisand's Bon Soir days with a touching rendition of ""Nobody's Heart (Belongs to Me)"" leading to a rousing ""When the Sun Comes Out""; then a condensed version of ""The Woman in the Moon"" from ""A Star Is Born"" in tribute to House Speaker-elect Nancy Pelosi and Senator Barbara Boxer both in attendance at the final stop in Los Angeles; and two entirely skippable tracks from Il Divo (ah, the beauty of track selection on DVD). A behind-the-scenes featurette is also included consisting of interviews with long-time collaborators like her rarely seen manager, Marty Erlichman; and finally a description of the Streisand Foundation as provided by executive director Marge Tabankin, who speaks glowingly of Streisand's philanthropy.

The second disc (*****) is an archive of her classically appointed 1994 concert tour which feels as much like a performance piece as it does a concert - especially with the insertion of film clips, a mock-duet with Marlon Brando from ""Guys and Dolls"", and three therapy sessions. Those who already own the previously released DVD,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barbra-Streisand-The-Concert-Live-at-the-MGM-Grand/dp/B0001MDQ30/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barbra Streisand - The Concert Live at the MGM Grand</a>, which documents her first show of the mini-tour, will not find too many surprises here. Most of the changes occur in the second half with both the Linda Richman/Mike Myers comedy routine and the Disney song selection cut in favor of a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yentl/dp/B0000025Y1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yentl</a>&nbsp;medley. Looking elegant on her Jefferson-inspired set, she performs impeccably, although I have to admit in hindsight that I prefer the more relaxed Streisand I see in the later concert.

The third disc (****1/2) is a fascinating making-of featurette which really shows Streisand's mastery in the recording studio as well as some of her perfectionism. It's enthralling to see her with the likes of Stephen Sondheim, whose songs she interprets with emotional acuity on ""The Broadway Album"". The interview with director William Friedkin is pretty interesting considering the promotional nature of the piece. As a bonus feature, there is an archival performance included from each of her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/first-five-TV-specials/dp/B000B9PW7G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">first five TV specials</a>&nbsp;(1965-73) for good measure.

3785633,5,B001SF8FLW,"Like most Streisand fans' I have longed for the DVD of the 2006 concert for two years. I saw Barbra Live in Atlanta in 2006, and O' what a great show it was! I also was at The Anaheim show on a Wednesday, July 20th, 1994, if I recall correctly. As one will see on this DVD collection Barbra's voice couldn't have been better in 1994 at The Arrowhead Pond. Yet it is the 2006 concert that really celebrates everything that make Barbra the greatest star, the legend for all times, and our best singer ever!  Even though the voice has changed it matters not, because one has never seen Barbra so relaxed, so warm and loving as she is on this concert in Florida in 2006. I had an ah hah moment when I watched the DVD.  It suddenly occurred to me it's not even Barbra's God given voice that make her the best, rather, it's her soul voice, if you will, that shines through out this concert.  It doesn't hurt that the visual presentation and sound are superior to any film concert I have ever seen. I can't imagine how the blu ray could be any better.  The packaging is also outstanding in this 3 DVD set. Each DVD is also a different color a nice touch, and there is a special booklet inside.  This is well worth the wait, and a real bargain!  It is simply Barbra at her best!",1241395200,,1270,4.205761316872428
3785634,5,B001SF8FLW,"The thing about Barbra concert DVDs is you can watch them over and over and over and over and forever be discovering new facets to her performance--to the singing, her facial expressions, her body attitudes, the staging, the lighting, the sound, the orchestrations.  So you get a new show every time out and that in itself is a value.  Even without all that, this package is a value, put together with obvious love and care and respect for the people putting out money for it.  Even without THAT, how often do you see an artist who is a truly unique and original talent and personality, who at this point in a lengthy and spectacular career is still learning and growing and perfecting her art, who can still surprise both her audiences and herself, and who has reached that rare stage of enjoying what she is doing and letting her audience come through the door and join her as family.  The concerts in this package are outstanding in every measure but beyond that they are totally comfy and enjoyable and warm and comforting.  When Barbra sings, all is right with the world.  You won't find any artist with greater respect for her audiences or a stronger sense of obligation to the muses of excellence.  Get this and give it as a gift for birthdays and holidays to your family and friends.  Let everyone celebrate!  (*The title of an early Streisand song.)",1241395200,2,1358,4.625
3785645,5,B001SF8FLW,"Live In Concert 2006 far surpasses all previous Barbra Streisand concerts released on home video in the artistry of its production, from Barbra's marvelous performance to appealing staging, elegant lighting, dazzling sound, and overall warmth.  Indeed, the Blu-ray presentation is the ideal way to enjoy the show, as it realizes the true enhanced resolution captured by the many high definition cameras in Sunrise, Florida's BankAtlantic Center on that special night in October 2006.  Seeing the amazing concert in its entirety relives the memorable evening my wife and I shared with Barbra in Atlanta only a week later and promises to be a wondrous experience for first-timers.  Barbra's complete program is here, including her humor-filled Q&A with the audience via note cards, shout-outs, and a surprise short version of ""Stoney End.""  The George Bush comedy sketch is excluded but not missed, while the bonus features include Barbra's extraordinarily delicate ""Nobody's Heart (Belongs To Me)"" backed only by piano, ""When The Sun Comes Out"" (an early `60s concert number), and ""The Woman In The Moon"" filmed with regular lighting and standard definition at L.A.'s Staples Center at the end of the tour.  Barbra delivers an inspiring introduction to the song and to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senator Barbara Boxer in the audience.  Il Divo's ""My Way"" appears right before ""Come Rain Or Come Shine,"" with their other two songs viewable among the bonus features.  ""The People Behind The Scenes"" is a neat 6-minute segment with comments about Barbra from manager Marty Erlichman (""I still get goosebumps""), Jay Landers (""She discovered new meaning in songs she sang when she was younger""), director Gary Smith (""This is forever and should be""), Richard Jay Alexander, and conductor-arranger Bill Ross.  Marge Tabankin, The Streisand Foundation's executive director, speaks for 10 enlightening minutes mainly about Barbra.

While we have enjoyed the Live In Concert 2006 CD for two years, the concert on video, particularly in full 1080p HD only available on Blu-ray, really brings you front and center, and Barbra's musical performances are truly compelling.  ""Funny Girl,"" sung for the first time in 40 years, is almost all in close-up and sounds as poignant as ever.  Another highlight, although often performed, is ""The Way We Were"" with a gliding camera move from one side of Barbra to the other.  Throughout the concert, the multiple camera work is flawless and flowing, with graceful editing, harkening back to classic television and concert videos with long-lasting shots that allow us to savor each lyric instead of today's quick-cutting style.  ""Unusual Way"" is definitely one of the highlights, as one camera pulls in and pushes out and another captures Barbra's figure from the sides and her contented smile at the song's conclusion.  ""Don't Rain On My Parade (reprise)"" is a perfect first encore, a sheer delight and bare-footed triumph.  For the final encore, ""Smile,"" Barbra and the audience focus attention on Samantha, her darling white poodle/bichon, whose great affection for Barbra is also evident elsewhere in the program.  Barbra's final performance of the evening is sublime and further conveys a renewed emotional connection with her adoring audience.",1241222400,24,3285,5.300578034682081

The 3-DVD set adds the 102-minute July 1994 concert exactly as shown on HBO in 1994, but this time in surround sound, and the 1987 HBO special on the making of The Broadway Album, both making first-time DVD appearances.  Rounding out disc 3 is a sampler of songs from each of Barbra's first five TV specials, which were previously released on DVD.",1241222400,3,3634,5.225473321858864
3785647,3,B001SF8FLW,"I too was at a few of these concerts (Chicago and Lauderdale) and to say Babs was not in the best voice is an understatement.  Let me start off by saying that there is no bigger fan than I and I agree that even on Barbra's worst day, she is still better than just about anyone else, but ... that doesn't give her license to get lazy (vocally).  It was quite strange seeing her live this time; she would occassionally hit a bumb note, but then within the same song she would become literally as crystal clear as one of her albums.  Trust me when I say, this DVD has been SERIOUSLY edited, and that's OK; it  certainly explains the ridiculous delay.  By the time she hit Europe, the voice was REALLY in bad shape so it's not suprising none of that footage was used.  Her belting days are most definantly over and I guess if she just sticks with songs that fit this new handicap, she can still thrill (just in a different way). It is for this reason that I am particularily looking forward to the new CD with Krall, assuming it will be a ""quieter"" album with a jazzier feel.  BTW, I was thankful that the Ill Diva footage was used to a minimum.",1241136000,13,1141,4.2304147465437785
3785648,5,B001SF8FLW,"As the DVD co-director/producer Gary Smith says, this Streisand concert MUST be documented for generations to come.  Whether or not you're a die-hard fan, owning this piece of history is also a MUST.  Barbra Streisand, the 'perfectionist' also shows the truth in her imperfections.  A missed note, a hoarse voice at times, her connection (or non-connection) with a lyric, everything that makes her human is included here.  Not only the amazing concert of 2006 but a little bit of her maturing process as an artist is here, too.  Watch the newest concert first but be sure to enjoy the look back at her first specials from the mid-sixties, her creative process for her huge success on The Broadway Album.

3785650,5,B001SF8FLW,"There's some new stuff to add to your Barbra collection with the BARBRA STREISAND: THE CONCERT DVD set.

First off, the concert from 2006 features songs that have been beloved by Barbra fans for many years but we've never had the treat of seeing them performed live. Some songs have been performed on live albums like ""Starting Here, Starting Now"" (from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Live-Concert-at-the-Forum/dp/B0000024ZL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Live Concert at the Forum</a>) and  ""Come Rain Or Come Shine"" (from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Streisand-Live-In-Concert-2-CD-s/dp/B000JBXXXG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Streisand: Live In Concert (2 CD's)</a>&nbsp;or if you were lucky enough to get the bonus CD from the ""Timeless"" Concert). Other songs like ""(Have I Stayed) Too Long At The Fair?"" and ""Funny Girl"" have never been performed live (at least not to my knowledge) so you get some new stuff to see.

The musical intro and outro is from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Funny-Girl-1964-Original-Broadway-Cast/dp/B000002SNJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Funny Girl (1964 Original Broadway Cast)</a>&nbsp;overture and Barbra performs ""The Music That Makes Me Dance,"" which was replaced with ""My Man"" in the movie version of Funny Girl.

Another highlight from the 2006 concert DVD is a Q&A with the audience where they get to participate in a short sing-a-long to the song ""Stoney End"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stoney-End/dp/B0012GN3GY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stoney End</a>).

---DVD #2---1994 CONCERT AT THE ARROWHEAD POND

These television specials are available in their entirety from the box set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barbra-Streisand-The-Television-Specials/dp/B000B9PW7G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barbra Streisand - The Television Specials</a>.

The CONCERT... set also comes with a small color booklet with liner notes by writer and musical supervisor Jay Landers and has some pictures in it.

So even though it isn't an earth shattering live cabaret performance filmed at the ""Hungry-i"" from the 60s that was ""found"" among the vaults, STREISAND: THE CONCERT offers enough new material to keep us fans happy.

Of course Barbra's voice has changed over the years, as she might not have the range she used to, but she still has that vocal power and unmistakable sound that is pure Streisand.",1240963200,8,4351,7.07635009310987
3785651,5,B001SF8FLW,"It is true that Barbra's voice has changed over time.  In the 2006 concert DVD you will notice that her range is lower and there is, at times, some hoarseness, which I did not notice at the two concerts that I attended.  Nevertheless, it is still a remarkable instrument and her interpretive abilities are in full force.  If in doubt, simply listen to ""Unusual Way"".  I recently attended a Celine Dion concert and, although her voice is in top form, as an audience member, I did not feel a connection to her singing.  When Barbra sang ""People"" at the St. Paul concert, I was astounded at her ability to deliver this song to the audience after 40 years of singing it.  She simply touched us all at the level of Soul.

In the 1994 concert DVD, Barbra was in top vocal form.  I especially recommend the 1994 concert CD which is taken from her New York performance.  Her rendition of ""My Man"" from that concert is vocally stunning.

Well my friends, I think that this 2006 concert DVD is Barbra's swan song, at least in terms of singing concerts.  So don't be overly critical; simply watch and enjoy one of the greatest performers to ever grace the stage.  When will we see the likes of talent like this again?",1240963200,14,1206,4.45662100456621
3785652,3,B001SF8FLW,"I'm a lifelong Streisand fan, have had the pleasure of seeing her perform live - twice - and though I'm sure I'm in a minority here, I don't think this 2006 concert performance is as ""all that"" as everyone else seems to think (saw the show when it was in town).  For starters, to state that she has never sounded better is just simply untrue.  I'm not saying that she sounds bad - by any stretch of the imagination; but her timbre has naturally changed, and the range narrowed, over the years; to reach the zenith of ""A Piece of Sky"" and the ilk anymore is just out of the question (glad it was avoided this time around).  I still got my DVD copy the day of release (yesterday), but I think it is more than obvious, watching the two concerts back-to-back, that her voice has decreased in its abilities over the years.  But again - before you write any ""What?!?  Are you crazy?!?!?"" comments, I do realize that even a decreased-Streisand is miles ahead of any other female singer around today, or perhaps ever.  But ""never sounded better""?  Gimme a break.  Next you'll be saying she's never been thinner...",1240963200,22,1105,4.49
3785653,5,B001SF8FLW,"No matter what, you can always depend upon Barbra Streisand to deliver the goods.

At one time, she was criticized for her highly emotional delivery of tunes but this boxed set (and let's focus on the 2006 concert) shows that her embellishments aren't trimming - she pours her emotional soul into the songs turning them into fascinating plays.

I attended the concert here in NYC and was thrilled (to put it mildly) when her voice - still both powerfully strong and amazingly gentle - managed to wring every emotion out of the songs so that they still sound fresh and new.

Ms. Streisand, in show business for almost fifty years now, sings new numbers (Cock Eyed Optomist) and revisits others that she hasn't sung in many decades (of particular note is Have I Stayed Too Long At The Fair - the old Billy Barnes number that is given a fresh new approach by tinkering about with it).  Unlike others, she has grown into her music. In listening to the heart felt way Barbra Streisand delivers such gems as Somewhere or My Man you know that she has taken her years of experenice and is now pouring them into the songs. The song remains the same but it has an added texture and depth that comes with wisdom.

For a woman who has recently celebrated her 67th birthday (4/24/09), she still looks, and sounds, fabulous. No.  She looks and sounds BETTER than ever.

The three disc set also contains her 1994 concert (you will note how a 12 year span did nothing to diminish her powerful deliveries) and a cable special that was aired to coincide with The Broadway Album.

In all, the set is a fascinating look into a truly great American classic.",1240876800,7,1636,4.559726962457338
3785654,5,B001SF8FLW,"First there was the DVD of this concert: great!

This edition of the 2006 concert does Barbra justice. It's a Barbra-live experience like no other.
