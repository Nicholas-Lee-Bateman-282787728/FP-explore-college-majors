7751516,5,B01FR358V0,"Great Documentary about the epic music career of Mavis Staples with commentary from Bob Dylan, Levon Helms, Jeff Tweedy and others.",1482710400,,131,5.285714285714286
7751517,5,B01FR358V0,"by the end of the film, you realize you've traveled over a large chunk of
a virtual century of American life: African American life from the bare
recent shadows and specter of slavery and intense Jim Crowe, the
rise of the, very lone voice at first, person of Dr. King, and the parallel
and intertwined presence of Pop Staples and his daughters, the Staples
Sisters, and of course, so poignantly, that of the young vibrantly gifted
Mavis Staples... and her journey from singing at the side of Dr. King,
to her influencing, then being influenced, by her one time suitor Bob Dylan,
(and clearly friend and admirer to this day... the interviews with Dylan show
him in a rare complimenting respectful manner as he speaks of meeting
Mavis and Pop and the Sisters when he was a young man... the only time i have
ever seen clip of an interview with Dylan where he seems to forget his
seemingly omnipresent acidic, bumbling offensiveness (likely a very acute shyness,
and social-phobia) that doesn't communicate well, except in his genius-level song-writing),
to just speak so clearly with admiration of other persons... a Nobel
Prize winner talking of Mavis and these exquisite legends, heroes, beautiful
beings, true ...and non judgemental... people, children, daughters of God,
real Christians.... that is what Mavis clearly is and is seen to be in this non
pretentiously paced film.... On a personal note, the film and Mavis' life,
as well as that of her omnipresent supportive sister Yvonne, made me feel okay,
even good, about being an aging artist myself... still creating, as is Mavis,
with the shadow of our own mortality now so tangibly present and growing, but
still creating, still singing, still carving forms and colors of oil paint and the chorded
steel strings of an old electrified guitar, and that voice, and being: Mavis Staples.

woman of God.",1482537600,3,1881,4.936908517350158
