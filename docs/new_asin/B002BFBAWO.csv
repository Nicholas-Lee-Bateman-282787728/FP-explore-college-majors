3893693,2,B002BFBAWO,Why was this rated R?,1483315200,,21,3.4
3893694,3,B002BFBAWO,"Writer/Director Greg Mottola in his youth actually worked at an amusement park similar to the one depicted in the movie.  Mottola we know best and most affectionately for his great film Superbad.  I liked Adventureland well enough but it does not come to the classic status of Superbad.  But it does give several young actors a chance to show off their skills and they take advantage of the chance to do just that.  Parts of movie had the smell of actors doing a scene in class, which we might expect for young, not fully formed talents early in what will be long and productive careers.
  Jesse Eisenberg, one of my favorite actors these days and one who has done some really great roles, plays a very smart kid forced to postpone his advanced education by a down turn in the family finances.  He goes to work at an amusement park in desperation where he meets an odd assortment of characters.  He, a tentative personality, comes into contact with a charismatic fraud, a musician turned repair man played by Ryan Reynolds.  The two vie for the attention of Kristen Stewart, another much too bright for the environment youngster.
  These luminaries are supported by the likes of Kristen Wiig and Bill Harder as the couple managing the park.  Also appearing is the very familiar Martin Starr.  Still young Starr has 91 movie and TV credits on his sheet.  He has worked in two of the now seminal TV comic series Party Down and Freaks & Geeks, both very popular series that have incubated a pack of talented and now famous young actors.
  This average comedy is notable for the chance to watch some of the up and comers in Hollywood work before they became famous.  This R rated film runs for one hour and 46 minutes.  Made on a budget of just under $10 million Adventureland brought in a below par $17 at the box office.
  Adventureland is the first of three films featuring Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart, Cafe Society and American Ultra being the others.",1481155200,,1959,4.6231884057971016

3893709,3,B002BFBAWO,"I would recommend for anyone to go ahead & watch this movie & decide for themselves if they like it or hate it.  I'm sort of on the fence & neither liked it or hated it.  It is a little weird & depressing. The role of Ryan Reynolds never at any point in the movie gives him justice as to how talented he actually is as an actor.  Ryan Reynolds is way too talented to be playing such a boring ordinary role.
Jesse Eisenberg doesn't actually match his character & his character itself (James Brenan) is not believable! Someone like James Brenan may actually exist but is probably one in a billion & that person would be both very confused & very confident about life at the same time! Which I argue is not possible, making his character not believable & not relatable to the audience!
But if you're bored & you are a fan of any of the cast members please take the time to watch this movie.",1475798400,,887,4.236686390532545

3893730,3,B002BFBAWO,"Not every film by this reviewer has to have a serious social message (although it helps) or be so gripping that he had to see the thing over and over again as it becomes one of filmdoms classic pieces like Sunset Boulevard. Sometimes, and the film under review Adventureland exactly fits this category, he just needs film to ward of the willies. Usually a comedy of some sort will fill the bill and in this case it is a romantic comedy that has calmed his nerves.

No question it never hurts that the locale of this comedy was located in Adventureland, in an amusement park, run down though it might be, since he has been enthralled by the magic of the neon lights and its swarm of grifters, drifters, goofs and midnight sifters at amusement parks and carnivals since early childhood. Still does consider himself an above average hand at Skee and its coupon-laden kewpie doll prizes. Actually, and he has written about the fact elsewhere, had run away with the carnival for a couple of days in his youth before being reined in by fearful and angry parents. So he has a pedigree of sorts in what the lure of the bright lights, tumultuous array of sounds, and smells from hot dogs to cotton candy brings to the even the normally sedate.

Of course the amusement park motif is just so much backdrop for the real boy-meets-girl angle behind this and more than half the films ever created. Heres the play. James, played by Jesse Eisenberg, is an aspiring graduate student, Columbia School of Journalism no less, with downwardly mobile parents who cannot afford to spring for a promised  grand tour of Europe and hence the summer job at Adventureland, the fate of many liberal arts graduates of late. As he gets the hang of the job after about two minutes, basically as long as it takes a co-worker to fill him of the grift, the scams that make the suckers pay for cheapjack stuff and like it, he becomes friendly with plenty of the co-workers. The usual cross-section of guys and gals who work the carny/theme park scene down at the edges of society.

One of those co-workers, Emily, played by fetching Kristie Stewart last seen in this space working her magic on the guys who played Neal Cassady and Jack Kerouac in the film adaptation of the latters On The Road, catches his eye and we are off to the races. Naturally it would be a very short film if the obvious attraction they had for each other had them immediately go off into the blissful sunset. Problem number one was that James was by choice, by discriminating choice, if you can believe this in this day in age, a virgin and was not sure whether he wanted to commit to Emily and wind up doing the do with her, a sexually experienced woman. Problem number two alienated from her parents Emily was in a hush-hush sexual relationship with the parks married handyman. Dont worry because in the end after some serious talking and smoking some serious weed they do wind up going hand and hand into the sunset, wind up doing the do.

By the way it never hurts either in a film on youthful confusion about life to have a soundtrack that features the late Lou Reeds Pale Blue Eyes and other songs done with the Velvet Underground.",1473897600,,3177,4.537521815008726

I do love them as actors, but as a couple, I didn't see any chemistry between them, and I would never put them together because they are such different types.
So, I am giving this movie two stars, one for each of them, because they obviously did their best with what they had to work with.
It is only because they were in this movie that I watched it through to the end.

I found this movie boring and dragged out.
I didn't like any of the characters and I just didn't care what happened to any of them.
All of the characters were either losers or hurting each other or using each other.
If this was supposed to be a comedy, I didn't get it, because I didn't laugh or even smile once.

I love movies about the 80s, but the 80s were not prominent enough in this movie.
I didn't see any Madonna lookalikes, and that was everywhere in the 80s, and there was not one single Madonna song.
None of my favorite 80s songs were played in the movie, instead there was a lot of alternative rock.

It was stupid the first time, not sure why it was every 20 minutes throughout the movie as if it was the theme. Nice ensemble cast with good acting. Jesse Eisenberg is always great. Never fond of Kristen Stewart but they did well together as they did in American Ultra. The age was a bit confusing. I was of the assumption from some of the silliness that they had just graduated from high school ... but then they were shown drinking in bars.  At the time that could have meant 18 or 21. Music was particularly good but not really featured in a memorable way. It would be a good soundtrack to pick up.",1452297600,,777,4.3517241379310345

3893905,4,B002BFBAWO,"One of my favorite 80s period pieces.  Grand performances all around, from the (mostly) dry humor of Hader and Wiig to the great work from Martin Starr.  And Jesse Eisenberg is great too, though a lot of the same eccentricities he displays here can also be seen in Social Network.  I didn't see those in Zombieland to a great degree, so I don't think it's a weakness on the actor's part.  Speaking of eccentricity, there's Kristen Stewart.  She's not Twilight bad, in fact I think her performance here is far better, but that's not saying much.  She's tolerable and doesn't single-handedly ruin the film.  Ryan Reynolds' small role doesn't do much for me.  He's jumps back and forth from being a jerk to being decent, for a guy who is cheating on his wife.  Overall great film, I highly recommend it.",1448409600,,800,4.617021276595745

3893908,5,B002BFBAWO,"This small gem of a film will win you over quickly and completely.

James (Jesse Eisenberg) finds his world turned upside down after financial problems force the cancellation of a planned post-undergrad trip to Europe.  Back home in suburban Pittsburgh, he's forced to take a job at a second-rate amusement park to pay for grad school.  What plays out is the usual summer of workplace intrigue as he becomes part of the Adventureland cosmos.

The plot itself is standard coming-of-age fare and after about 20 minutes, you can pretty much work out the general direction if not the specific twists.  It's nothing you haven't seen before in lesser films.  What makes this one stand out is director Greg Mottola's eye for detail.  Particularly great is the use of music--interesting and indie when accentuating the characters' personalities, mind-numbing and repetitive when underscoring the dead end jobs at the park (Falco's ""Rock Me Amadeus"" always seems to show up at the most mundane moments).  You know a film's going to champion a certain ragged worldview when you hear ""Bastards of Young"" by the Replacements before you even see the title sequence. The world Mottola creates seems absolutely real and that's important because it's the bond the audience makes with that world that provides the emotional payoff.

Of course, that would all be meaningless without the stellar work by the ensemble cast. Eisenberg's nervous talkiness and fidgeting is a perfect match of actor and character and the support players match him at every turn. The always great Martin Starr (""Freaks and Geeks"") adds depth as James' intellectual comrade in arms.  Kristen Stewart shines as Em, James' workplace crush.  Alternately flashing a steely independent streak with moments of striking vulnerability, she reconnects with the potential she flashed prior to her ""Twilight Days.""  Equally good is Ryan Reynolds perfectly cast as Connel the park's maintenance guy, an irresponsible cad with family responsibilities who's stuck in a state of suspended adolescence right down to using his mom's basement for a love nest.  It's a character who could easily lapse into stereotype, but Reynolds plays him with enough of a hint of self-awareness that you can't help but see him as a decent guy in spite of his flaws.  There's one particular moment near the film's end where Eisenberg's James subtly dresses Reynolds' character down in front of a crowd--with nothing more than a subtle facial expression, Reynolds lets us know the character gets it.

Best of all are Bill Hader and Kristin Wiig in small but important roles as the park owners.  Combined, they probably don't have 10 minutes of screen time but they make every second count with one memorable scene after another.

All of these elements combine to create a near classic.  If ""Adventureland"" isn't ultimately as perfect or profound as ""Almost Famous"" or ""Say Anything"", it's not far off.  That's honorable praise for a little film that delivers in a big way.",1447718400,,2996,5.08997955010225

Sure, it has its share of crude humor (it's another in a long line of works from the Rogen-Apatow types), but there's also considerable heart and nuance beneath that, anchored by strong performances by the entire cast (hell, even Kristen Stewart does a really good job) and really witty yet realistic writing by director Greg Mottola. I borrowed this from the library on a whim to watch some crap and was so impressed that I actually bought a copy. Honestly one of the few movies I've seen in recent memory that exceeded my expectations by leaps and bounds, I don't know how it could have been ignored on initial release and hope it finds a strong following (if it hasn't already - I mean, I'm kinda five years late).",1420156800,,810,4.554794520547945

After watching him in two recent dramatic roles (the terrific Night Moves and the interesting The Double where he portrayed two versions of himself) and re-watching The Squid & The Whale, it was time to go to some of his earlier comedic roles.  This is set in 1987, his character (James) needs a summer job to help cover college costs and he ends up at the Adventureland amusement park.  Predictably, he meets a few other workers that he enjoys, is attracted to Em (Kristen Stewart, nice to see her outside the Twilight series), and learns some life lessons.  The movie was pleasant and predictable; always fun to watch Bill Hader and Kristin Wigg, but I think the film The Way Way Back from last year did a better job with a similar setting (it was a water park) and dynamics (the main characters were younger) in learning some life lessons.",1404777600,,895,4.610062893081761

I am almost certain this movie is based on some real life experience of somebody out there.  For those reasons, the movie is believable for me and I enjoyed watching it.

3894043,3,B002BFBAWO,"No matter how hip and smart this indie comedy tries to be, it's not enough to save it from the genres overdone cliches. The major issue is Adventureland's two main characters, played by Jesse 'Dat Awkward' Eisenberg and Kristen '2 Angsty 4 Skool' Stewart. Yes, they are perfect for their roles, but their characters seem like forced compilations of dozens of other indie-com personalities, making them very hard to root for or against or even care about them too much. Adventureland is an enjoyable watch though. It has a pretty great cast, a typically lovable indie-centric soundtrack, a fun setting, some interesting supporting characters, and a few genuine moments of heart and emotion. Wannabe hipsters will adore it, actual hipsters will loathe its predictability, and pretty much everyone else will find it a decent coming-of-age movie.",1402358400,,842,5.198529411764706

3894047,4,B002BFBAWO,"You could create a 'Kristen Stewart Drinking Game' based upon every time she runs her hand threw her hair and brushes it back in this movie.  And you did so, you would be plastered within no time at all.
Adventureland is the rare film set in the 80's that gets it right.  Instead of creating a film where the 80's jokes are forced and the 4th wall is broken for cheap laughs, the end result is a film that just happens to be set in the 80's rather than a film that forces you back into the decade of pastel kicking and screaming.  Here you have a coming of age story that most of us can relate to, regardless of what decade we grew up in, that is a successful film on the whole.  Everyone will recognize the Adventureland amusement park as standing in for the local version they grew up with, and many of the characters will remind the viewer of people they grew up with.
This is perhaps Kristen Stewart's best performance in a film to date.  Here she shows that given the right materials and actors to work with, she is capable of pulling off a good performance.  Stewart is no different from any other actor.  Sometimes she is the victim of weak material (Twilight) or otherwise puts in a poor performance (Snow White and the Huntsman).
Ryan Reynolds does a good of playing the cool older friend, who has a bit of manipulation and deceit in him.  A pre-Bridesmaids Kristen Wiig has a nice smaller role.  Jesse Eisenberg basically plays himself.
Adventureland is a film that will evolve in the near future into cult status, if it is not already there.  It may be a bit of a stretch to say that it is the 'Dazed and Confused' of the 2000's, but it is close.  'Games, Games, Games' tshirts are available on the web.

3894050,5,B002BFBAWO,"If you've ever had conspiracy theories about the games at amusement parks, here's the proof for pretty much every single one of them...they're all rigged.  But besides proving that theory right and probably resulting in me being banned from all amusement parks and their games from here on out, this is a good film.  It's actually based on a theme park on Long Island, though it was filmed in Pennsylvania because the actual park had changed so much from the 1980s era that we see in the film.  I do agree with that location choice, but I do wish they could have filmed in the actual Adventureland.  But I blame that park's owners for changing everything so much...again, I'm probably now banned for life.  Anyway, this film was filled with a cast of characters who, while trying to find their way in life, work at this amusement park, amusingly run by Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader (seriously, this couple is just fun to watch, even if they are not the main characters.)  The film's diologue was, for the most part, witty and entertaining, making it feel almost like real life.  I did think that Jesse Eisenberg's character (our leading man) ranged from being whiny to goody-goody...all annoying traits in my book.  Yes, your life isn't going the way you nessessarily want it to...that doesn't mean you have to constantly complain about it or speak in a way that just puts you so far out of touch with everyone else.  The only scene of his that I really enjoyed was when he worked at the horse-racing game.  Thank God Kristen Stewart was there to straighten him out for the rest of the film...or at least she tried.  But Ms. Stewart delivered a performance worth watching and I say that in large part to the fact that she whined only when it was really called for.  While she takes the prize of playing my favorite female character in the film, Martin Starr plays my favorite male character.  Mr. Starr's character of Joel delivers that witty banter that comes about even when the speaker isn't trying to be witty, a perfect trait for this film.  Maybe there should be a sequel/spinoff about him...Sorry, I don't have the cash for it or I'd totally make that happen.  This film is a comedy and strives to be nothing else...and I'm just fine with that.  It delivers great jokes laced across a good plot with a great setting.  It's definetly worth this five-star rating.  Enjoy.",1400371200,3,2375,4.627684964200477

3894060,3,B002BFBAWO,"James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) just graduated college and starts to get ready for his dream vacation to Europe before studying at an Ivy League school.  That is until Brennans father had a career setback causing them to have no money.  Now Brennan must find a job to cover his upcoming expenses by working at a local amusing park, Adventureland.  As he is adjusting to the amusement park life, Brennan starts to fall for his coworker, Emily Lewin (Kristen Stewart).  The young carnies start to have some learning experiences about love, life and trust.  In addition, Brennan starts to his true values.

I really enjoyed the storyline of this movie.  Adventureland was an independent film made by This Is That Productions that Miramax films picked up.  In this independent film it focuses on more of a darker realistic issue than the portrayal of a hero or villain based movie.  In the movie, Brennan has a bachelors degree with no work experience that is causing him to settle for a job at an amusement park.  Ultimately throughout the movie he is learning about himself and his true values after hitting some dark times.

The acting ability in this movie was impressive.  Kristen Stewart plays the same role as she does in every movie.  She seems to be this awkward girl who lacks acting ability.  However her acting fits perfectly this role, and Jesse Eisenberg did a great job as well.  I think Kristen and Jesse are a great match for acting together.

This movie has a little of everything in it (romance, comedy, action, etc.) and I recommend it for anyone looking for a good Netflix movie.

3894068,4,B002BFBAWO,"Its Ronald Reagans 1987 and curly-haired college dweeb James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) is dumped by his girlfriend Arlene in Scene 1. Then his promised European Road Trip is kyboshed in Scene 2 by his downsizing parents who cant afford new drapes let alone a graduation present. Then things get really nasty for our sensitive Renaissance student when hes sentenced to work at the notorious cesspool that is the Adventureland Amusement Park in Pittsburgh (title above).

But during a brutally honest induction course from the bug-eyed Joel (great work from Martin Starr) James notices something well worth the pain of puking children and a childhood pest called Frigo who cant seem to resist jokily kicking him in the privates at every opportunity. The eye-opener James clocks is the seemingly ordinary yet ethereally beautiful Em (Kristen Stewart) who is all Lou Reed and David Bowie teeshirts and smoky eyes and magical long hair. The kind of girl you want to make mix tapes for and even consider joining a gym. From the moment he meets the svelte Em poor James is a goner  hopelessly falling for the emotionally conflicted young woman no matter what extra-curricular crap she pulls on him.

Ems biological mom has passed two years prior via a long and horrible battle with cancer and shes left living with a Stepmom she despises (and vice versa) and a father who seems unable to fathom his daughter. Em is therefore feckless in her relationships and reluctant to commit to anything other than drinking and toking and hanging out after work  sappily accepting the occasional rumble in the kitchen with Mike the Rock 'n' Roll star of the Park (a cool and suave Ryan Reynolds). But James the nice guy persists despite customers who try to rob the Giant Pandas and the attention of the playgrounds curvaceous babe Lisa P (the deeply sexy Margarita Levieva). Slowly but surely Em begins to see the merits of a nice guy whos willing to take a few punches for her and equally not allow her to anyones punching bag. ""You may be the cutest and coolest guy I've ever dated"" she finally admits in a clincher behind the arcades - making James want to go all Johnny Weissmuller and yodel from the trees.

The funniest parts go to Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig as the odd couple Bobby and Paulette who run the rip-off-for-all-the-family rides and games with a baseball bat and motivational speeches about horse races. Also like Cameron Crowes wonderful ""Elizabethtown"" - ""Adventureland"" has a gargantuan soundtrack  featuring a cool tune from all periods in almost every scene. Lou Reed, The Cure, Big Star, The Replacements, The Rolling Stones, Nick Lowe and Crowded House  to name but a few - the list of appropriate choices is legion and they're used well (as James watches Em drive  you can see him falling in love as Lou Reeds lyrics echo his aching for her).

The Blu Ray pictured is defaulted to 16 x9/1.85:1 so its fills the entire screen but because a large amount of the scenes take place at night and in peoples homes  those shots can have some grain and fuzziness.

No, never heard of it? If I would have known she was in it the play button never would've been touched.

3894083,5,B002BFBAWO,This movie is such an underrated gem. I'm very happy that it is starting to find an audience thanks to Amazon Prime and Netflix. It reminds me of movies that they used to make all of the time in the 80s and 90s but are no longer in vogue today. I can not recommend this film enough.

1)  In Trifles, how do the men's conversations and actions reveal their attitudes toward women?
The men feel they have more power over the women. They do not appreciate the women because they think that they have no idea how to solve a murder case. The think by looking at the silly little things in the house such as the quill, the bird cage, messy table rotten fruit and Mrs. Wright not having kids yet having such a messy house is out of the ordinary the men feel these details are not important because they do not lead into helping solve the murder when in reality they do.
2. What is the significance of the birdcage and the dead bird? What do they symbolize? Why do Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters respond so strongly to them? How do you respond?
The birdcage is evidence of a bird missing,. The empty bird cage leaves these women to wonder what had happened to the bird. When they find the dead bird they realize that Mrs. Wright had killed her husband and used the bird as a practice kill. They women react so strongly because they know how miserable Mrs. Wright was married and since they men would not notice this small insignificant evidence of the bird cage they hide the evidence to make sure Mrs. Wright was not arrested. I do not know how to respond
3. Characterize John Wright. Why did his wife kill him?
Mr. Wright was a boring average man who did not like to socialize. By what Mrs. Hales says that he did not want to put in a phone because people talk to much anyways. Mrs. Wright felt lonely not having anyone but her husband. Her cheerful spirit was slowly starting to be drained. His wife killed him because she felt suffocated. She had no one but her husband and her husband did not want her to socialize either. She felt trapped as if she had no choice but to kill him.
4. What is the significance of the play's last line, spoken by Mrs. Hale: ""We call it knot it, Mr. Henderson""? Explain what you think the tone of Mrs. Hale's voice is when she says this line. What is she feeling? What are you feeling?
In the beginning of the play the two women were trying to figure out if Mrs. Wright was going to quill or knot it for the quilt. The men made fun of the women. In the end the men ask why they decided Mrs. Wright is going to do they say knot it because the women have solved the murder knowing that Mrs. Wright has killed her husband, but the men do not know. The line has a hidden meaning so I think the tone of Mrs. Hales is confident and empowering. She feels that she is smarter than the men by solving the mystery even though the men do not know. I feel that these women have every right to feel confident about themselves because these men do not view them equal.",1382572800,,2708,4.235976789168278

3894098,5,B002BFBAWO,"While not as ""laugh-out-loud"" funny as ""Superbad"", this movie was a subtler comedy, where most of the funny moments come from the interactions of the characters rather than outlandish situations.  Set in the late 80's, Eisenberg plays the main character, a recent college graduate working at Adventureland to raise funds to attend Columbia graduate school.  Viewers in their young 20's will find this premise crazy, because these days there's no way anyone could fund their education (especially at Columbia) with a summertime carnival gig, but those thoughts faded into the background as the awkward but sweet chemistry between Eisenberg's James and Kristen Stewart's Em emerges.

Aside from the romantic backstory, other characters are given a chance to shine--including Bill Hader as the nerdy, penny-pinching boss, Margarita Levieva as Lisa P., Adventureland's hot girl-next-door, and Ryan Reynolds as Connell, a womanizing married man.

Overall, it was a less climactic movie than some of the films it will inevitably be compared to, but what it lacks in outrageousness it makes up for in relatable characters and an ending (not spoiled here) that will make even the most stoic movie watcher smile.",1381104000,,1203,5.349206349206349

He's one of those kids that's never had a real job before, and the only place willing to hire him is the local theme park, Adventureland.
He meets a seemingly nice young lady, and he develops feelings for her.
Unfortunately, she's going through some confused (cough whore cough) stage of her life.
Of course there are some shenanigans involved, and it's not all drama, but I'm not sure I'd call the movie a comedy.
I liked the movie, and might even buy it if I see it in the $5 bin somewhere.

Or are people like the protagonist. a selfish and self absorbed jerk, who spends his life obsessed with sex and whom he can get it from. He claims to be an intellectual, but he and his friends are all frauds. Those arrogant friends, far better than the Neanderthals who inhabit their world and don't know who Gogol was or enjoy wasting their money trying to win crappy prizes, have to endure the agony of an entry level job. How awful for such astounding intellects and higher beings! How they will retaliate when they get tenure.

3894120,3,B002BFBAWO,"I watched this movie on the Fourth Of July.  I guess I thought it would be more of a ""summer"" type movie.  It was, in a way, so on the closing weekend of summer, for lack of anything better to do, I thought I'd write a review.

This movie is a period piece. It's one of those movies that feel like it was made as a period piece mainly because, if the characters had cellphones, a lot of their problems would have been solved right away.

It's set in 1987, which appears to be one of the most fertile times for 2000s period pieces (Donnie Darko, House Of The Devil, etc.). I think it was in 1987, anyway.  If so, it's some sort of parallel dimension 1987 where the average chick who goes to amusement parks a) is really impressed by the fact that a guy played guitar with Lou Reed, and b) knows who Lou Reed is.  Sort of like Donnie Darko's parallel dimension, where everybody listens to Tears For Fears, Echo & The Bunnymen and The Church, but nobody is blasting Dokken or Huey Lewis.  But then, that WAS in a parallel dimension, so I guess I can't really criticize it for that.

The characters smoke a lot of pot.  Only a few people smoke cigarettes.  So again, parallel dimension 1987.  They work at an amusement park and screw around all summer.  The main guy likes the main girl, and she seems to like him, and that's pretty much all you need to know.  The rest of the movie just sort of drifts along.

It drifts along, and it's sort of nice, because it means you don't really have to pay much attention to what is going on most of the time.  Not much really does, after all.  If French New Wave cinema can get away with that, why not a movie with the rather deceptive title ""Adventureland""?

Jesse Eisenberg is neurotic and annoying.  The girl from Twilight is nice to look at, even if she is somehow desiccated-looking.  Bill Hader spends the entire movie acting really boring and lame, all for a payoff in one scene that seems really predictable once you see it.  The guy who played Bill on ""Freaks And Geeks"" plays ""A Somewhat Older Version Of Bill With Longer Hair And A Pipe"" (that's quite an acting range).  Some guy who I guess is famous plays a guy who may or may not have played guitar with Lou Reed.

Some people have compared this movie to Superbad because it was made by the same guy.  They point out that it eschews the ""grossout"" humor of Superbad.  This is true.  It also eschews all other types of humor (except a guy who enjoys punching people in the beanbag) and most types of drama.  Like I said.  It just sort of drifts along.

Which could be a complaint, if you were expecting something to happen.  I wasn't, really.  And, if you remember back to summers like this one, when you were around this age, they really DID kind of just drift along.  The main characters spend the entire movie waiting for something to happen.  They really WERE kind of just killing time until the summer ended, and this movie is about that.

Usually, in these kinds of movies, the suspense comes from the obstacles placed between the star-crossed lovers, and how they overcome them.  In this movie, they're overcome by the guy just deciding to overcome them.  That's about it.

There is a subplot about anti-Semitism that seemed a little corny and tacked-on so that the movie had SOME relevance to something.  All I could think of when they were talking about it, though, was the fact that a Jewish director spent a couple million dollars making a movie where all of the sympathetic characters were Jewish, and all the non-Jewish characters seemed to have pretty significant brain damage, so it's not like he's...

But, you know what, it doesn't matter.  Nothing about this movie matters.

It just is.  This may sound like a complaint, but it's not.  Yes, it's boring, and nothing happens.  But nothing REALLY happens in Withnail & I either, and that's one of my favorite movies (and, weirdly enough, I just realized that that movie was a period piece about the sixties, made IN 1987, of all years.  Synchronicity?).

The thing is, Withnail & I had interesting characters, that were so vividly realized they practically leapt off the screen.  This movie doesn't, but then, most people aren't really like that.  Call it cinema verite.

Like I said.  Everyone has had a summer like this.  Where you just sort of kill time, waiting for something to happen.  This movie is about that summer.  It's kind of like this review.  It's not about anything, and spends a lot of time going off on pointless tangents.  But not every summer can be life-changing, like the one in The Sandlot.  Sometimes, someone is going to decide to make a movie about the pointless, boring summer everyone has.  If you're going to do that, how else do you do it?",1377907200,,4735,4.4865181711606095

I watched this movie after working a particularly long and depressing day at the State Fair and was pretty moved by the movie, actually.

We had not heard anything about this prior to viewing, so our expectations were not high, but we thought it was a really great movie, not AFI 100 great, just solid.  A lot more depth than most romcoms, the only downside was reallyKristen Stewart's less than stellar acting,  everyone else in the cast is excellent.

A young adult, college dreams shattered, is forced to work in an amusement park in an attempt to earn college tuition. While working, he meets a girl of similar age - they seem to get along well, but she is in what's apparently a sex only relationship with an older man.
This conflict drives them apart, and (his) summer ends with thoughts that he'll never see her again.

3894183,3,B002BFBAWO,"Hmmm.... I expected some sort of animated feature, but instead was subjected to the angst of young adulthood in Pittsburgh. I don't suppose I've ever really LOOKED at the poor souls who have to work at the game and ride concessions at a second-rate theme park. Now that I've had an insider's peek, I'll never treat them as invisible again.

And another thing: The movie credits actually showed the character and then the name of the actor who played it! What a treat. In the past, the standard way is to show the credits, then it is ASSUMED that we will know the faces for all those names...

Okay, back to the movie: Jesse Eisenberg (""Squid and the Whale"") is a newly minted college graduate ready to enjoy his graduation gift: a trip to Europe. Problem is, his father has just been downsized and the parents can no longer afford it. Instead, he is directed to a nearby theme park to work for the summer. He and most of the other employees agree: it is the worst job...EVER!

Of course, with all these young adults, hormones are raging, but the gal who most appeals to our hero is played by Kristen Stewart (""Twilight""). Unbeknownst to her co-workers, this Daddy's Little Girl is having a fling with the (married) repairman, played by Ryan Reynolds (""Definitely, Maybe""). She is desperately unhappy at home because her widowed father has just remarried.

Of course, the cast of characters is populated with nerds, sluts, drunks, druggies, and virgins (...but not for long...). Their boss and his wife are played to comic perfection by Bill Hader (""Tropic Thunder"") and Kristen Wiig (""Ghost Town"").

This is a predictable trip down the primrose path for our hero but I was surprised to see Ryan Reynolds play a less-than-admirable fellow this time out. That is quite a change of pace for him. Maybe there's hope yet!",1375488000,,1816,4.71608832807571

I liked Kristen Stewart's understated beauty; it didn't instantly overwhelm. Her character seemed resigned to a negative fate, too cool to complain.

In the background are dead parents, cruel step-parents, recently downsized/demoted or completely unemployed parents, a character who cheats on his wife with absolutely no moral qualms, drinking in almost every scene (what is everyone running away from?) and pot smoking in most of the others, some really bad decision making,""friends"" who would sell you out for a quarter, etc. Does all this strike you as funny?

Jesse Eisenberg stars as a kid whose forced to get a summer job at a local amusement park with a wacky cast of characters. Of course the only other normal one working there, just happens to be the girl that he falls for. Bill Hader plays the boss and he should be writing and starring in films like this instead of playing secondary characters. Hader is one of the funniest and most underrated comedians in Hollywood and I can honestly say that he is the only reason to watch this movie, because the rest of the cast is just dull and uninspired. Eisenberg gives another flat and emotionless performance, while co-star Kristen Stewart plays along as if she were still one of the undead. I generally like most of the cast and I thought the story was decent, but overall Adventureland is just another predictable lame duck comedy. It will give you a few laughs, but don't expect too much more.",1361491200,,1036,4.666666666666667

3894241,5,B002BFBAWO,"Everyone has had one.  The job that they really did not want, but took nonetheless.  This is by the same group who made movies like Superbad, Knocked up, etc.  It is not a traditional comedy however.  It is a combination coming of age, romance, some comedy and even some drama.  Jesse Eisenberg's character is stuck having to get a summer job at an amusement part when his plans to take a summer trip to Europe before starting school.  While there he falls for Kristen Stewart's character, and the story eventually follows their relationship.

The acting in the movie is top notch.  Even Kristen Stewart who has a tendency to be very wooden and monotone does a good job.  Bill Hader and Kristen Wig are great in their roles, as do the rest of the cast.  The film is set in the late 80s so those who grew up at that time will also appreciate the soundtrack as they came up with a lot of old 80s songs that will bring back memories for those old enough to remember that time.

The movie looks and sounds great on Blu Ray, although it is not really the kind of movie that you necessarily get that much more on Blu Ray as opposed to DVD.  If you are into coming of age movies, this one is definitely worth a look as long as you do not expect Superbad or American Pie level comedy.",1359158400,,1276,4.270833333333333

The way the director Greg Mottola arrives at this is by wit and then through that, laughs. Many of the employees at Adventureland are underemployed; they need to work at the park because of financial circumstances.

Although the film isn't truly a comedy, there are jokes here and there, namely by Martin Starr's character, Joel. Nonetheless, these jokes are intelligent or at least leaves one in awe as we understand how vast their knowledge is.",1358208000,,568,4.855670103092783

3894246,3,B002BFBAWO,"This move is just o.k. and it's not ""Truly Hilarious!"" to anyone but Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post like it says on the DVD cover. The only reason I got it was because I thought Bill Hader at an amusement park would be funny. If it didn't have Bill Hader's name on the cover, I wouldn't have bought it.

This is a semi-love triangle that includes Zombieland Boy, Twilight Girl and Green Lantern. The ""teen angst"" between Zombieland Boy and Twilight Girl is way overdone in this one. It might be charming the first 15-times Zombieland Boy stutters quietly and Twilight Girl looks like she's about to slit both wrist but you've got about 107-minutes of that here. For some reason you never tire of Green Lantern's cool, don't give a doo doo, sly mannerisms and wise man advice though. SNL's Kristen Wiig is restrained enough in this one with such little dialog that she's actually funny in her very limited role.

The 80s music is really great and you are not going to get some of the movie if you aren't from the 80s anyway. All the 80s touches, the hair, the music and the cars are all vintage.

This is an interesting movie to watch one time but it's not fall down funny. It's a decent chick flick with enough comedic elements in it for a dude to stay awake during the entire movie.",1354924800,,1288,4.4261603375527425

3894251,5,B002BFBAWO,Given all the 'noise' around Kristen Stewart in the past few months this movie is fascinating to watch in ways that no one could have imagined when it was made.  A young girl having an affair with a married man and with a crucial moment being the fact that she is seen in a car with that man?  Fact now collides with fiction.  This is a must see.,1350086400,,346,4.0588235294117645
3894252,1,B002BFBAWO,"Adventureland is the opposite of Superbad in almost every way except the 'coming of age' theme. Where Superbad was immature and funny, Adventureland is serious and 'mature'. The sad thing is Adventureland could've easily been a good comedy if the writers tried, but they didn't. They went for easy indie trite.

So what's so damn 'mature' about this film? Sure as hell wasn't the story, it's just another standard coming of age story with 'unique' 'hip' touches. It sure as hell wasn't the characters, they were all one-dimensional cardboard cutouts basically. In fact the only thing that seemed to have time put into it was constructing the excellent soundtrack, but like Garden State, a good soundtrack doesn't make your cheap coming of age story any better.

Let's go over the actors: Jesse Eisenberg has the same anti-social vibe from the Social Network (which was infinitely better), acts disinterested in everything, and is ultimately boring. So in other words he's the perfect uncharismatic protaginast! Kristen Stewart actually puts some effort into her acting, but her character is another dull love interest that's 'mature' because she's conflicted between two guys, you know, the same kinda maturity you see on an afternoon soap opera. Ryan Renolds sleepwalks through his performance as some burn out who never changes his expression nor voice to anything but monotone. Bill Hadar is the funny guy I guess? But he's not, he's just a more obvious douchebag than the rest of the cast, and his 'hilarious' moments are when he yells at people sporatically. Martin Starr as the friend had more natural charisma than the leading man, but again, he doesn't do anything like the rest of this dull cast. He kinda just stares off into space with a look that says 'nerd angst'. So they get all of these good actors and don't do ANYTHING with them, it's almost as big a waste of a solid cast as Life Aquatic.

The Story: take any coming of age story and apply here.

The Interactions: Oh boy, here's where the (unintentional) jokes come in, where to begin? Well speaking of one dimensional characters, there's some squeaker 'ex best friend' to Jesse Eisenberg who always kicks him in the balls, and yet Jesse hangs out with him anyway. It's like the writers are trying to make a familiar character that we all know in real life. And how does his story arc go? Eventually Jesse kicks him in the balls, to signify that he has indeed become a changed person. Barf. You're probably wondering how the conflict ends up between the two guys? Well there isn't any, it all ends with Jesse passive-aggresively calling Ryan an idiot for not knowing a Lou Reed song. And speaking of which the characters seem to compare their music collection like jocks compare penis sizes in a locker room, multiple times someone will say something like ""I got this new Lou Reed single"" and someone else is like ""wow, that's cool, lets totally play it and not be interested in anything going on"". I think Jesse realizes that he loves Kristen when she puts on Velvet Underground, and Ryan Reynolds is an idiot we should all look down on because he doesn't know that it's obviously Sattelite of Love, duh!

It's pretty painful watching how hard this movie tries to be hip, as if it's whole purposes is capturing teen apathy and being unique, but really it's another mass-produced indie film about 'finding yourself' and 'getting laid'. Avoid like it's the album Squeeze.",1349049600,5,3440,4.833616298811545

Being the last decade of innocence ( I call it that because once the Internet and cell phones went mainstream in the 90's the world totally changed and so did being young) it really catches that lack of media exposure that allowed us to live our lives, to be a product of the area we grew up in and not just one of the stressed out fast paced media driven young adults that we see today.

I literally walked away for a while to make dinner, came back, and found I really had not missed anything.

3894260,5,B002BFBAWO,"Well, I'll be darned.  This film was a very nice surprise.  An engagingly funny, intelligent, and warm comedy that, while not above a bawdy joke or two, still manages to present characters that feel substantial and real.  I wish I'd seen it sooner.

I don't know quite what I was expecting with this film - though I suspect I had visions of past films like ""Superbad,"" ""Pineapple Express,"" and ""Knocked Up""; which is to say, broadly funny films that had heart but also a fairly good deal of raunchy humor.  I enjoyed them all, in a modest way, but I've also recently begun to grow a bit weary of that style. (Call it the Judd Apatow formula of comedy - `Mucho raunchiness + heart.')

So, unwilling to plunk down a chunk of change to buy a movie that I had vague doubts about, I checked ""Adventureland"" out from my local library some two weeks before actually watching it.  I'd keep eyeing the movie's casing as it sat there on the shelf by my television, day after day, before opting to watch something else (or even, god help me, grabbing a book).  But last night, I broke down - for I had little else to do (well, that and the fact that my librarians were practically begging for me to bring the movie back); I'm glad I did.

The director, Greg Mottola (who also made the ""Superbad""), opts to skip a majority of the raunchy humor this time around (though there is a repeated gag about one kid hitting another in the unmentionables) for a brand of humor that is a little more subtle.

As other reviews have noted, this film is definitely not ""Superbad"" - even though it was marketed in a manner that suggested the two films were very much the same.  Where ""Superbad"" was a raunchy, if sweet-natured, film about the adolescent transition between high school and college, ""Adventureland"" is a quieter, slightly more contemplative film - apt, given that it is about lost, wayward, and awkward twentysomethings transitioning from college into real life.  The jokes here grow more from the comedy of human longing and emotion than they do from bodily function.

The cast is first rate - in some cases, surprisingly so.  Jesse Eisenberg, whom I had already seen in ""Zombieland"" and ""The Social Network"" - seems to have cornered the market on playing socially awkward roles.  He does it well, but here adds in a nice tinge of sweetness to his lead role of James.  He is genuinely believable as a smart kid with large dreams who is somewhat surprised to find himself working at a seedy amusement park.  Ryan Reynolds turns in a solid, nicely underplayed performance as a local lothario, and - quell surprise - Kristin Stewart proves her detractors wrong by turning in a skilled performance as an emotionally troubled kid who falls for Eisenberg.  As a bonus, ""Freaks and Geaks"" alum Martin Starr and SNL vets Bill Hader and Kristin Wiig give very funny supporting turns as denizens of the amusement park.

After watching this film, I had a feeling similar to the one that I got from watching the comedy ""My Idiot Brother,"" with Paul Rudd.  For though the laughs were there in plenty, I couldn't shake the feeling that in its own, quiet way, this film was just so very, very nice.  And I mean that as a real compliment.",1335312000,2,3211,4.588441330998249

3894294,3,B002BFBAWO,"There was one thing about this movie that I found repulsive.  Stewart was born in 1990.  Ryan was born in 1976.  The movie was distributed in 2009, which means it was probably made in 2008.  Considering how young Stewart is and looks in this one, Ryan's character is probably at best creepy and probably a pedophile, something you just can't see from Ryan and the writers offer no character development to explain how either character could do what they did.  Ryan has unique star talent but his stage presence is likable and charming, so for him to play a creepy pedophile, significant character development is necessary and missing entirely from this movie.  Couple that with Stewart maybe being 18 but looking 16 at best, and non-pedophiles will probably find part of this story to be gross.

That said, the movie is an exceptional period piece if you're interested in the development of Stewart and Eisenberg as actors.  Both struggle with parts that are too adult for their real life stage of development, but both seem to get better at their roles as the movie progressed, meaning that you can actually watch these two transition from being child actors to adult actors and because of that I found the movie very interesting. At the beginning, Stewart is so uncomfortable playing a romantic role that it is hard to watch, but by the end of the movie (with someone her own age), she takes on a different glow altogether and is much more comfortable in the role.  You could speculate an entirely different outcome of her role in Twilight had she not done this movie first (this one was filmed only a few months before).

Most people will be able to relate to this film... after all, haven't we all had that really crappy summer job where the only saving graces were the memorable people and after-work experiences that crossed our path because of the connections we made at the job?

While the film goes down easy, I appreciated its emotional complexity.  In particular, there's a special effort in the film to keep the characters from being too predictable and one-note: Everyone seems to have good and less-than-good qualities, and act in both stable and not-so-stable ways.  For the most part, the characters use their particular strengths to help out other characters who don't have those same strengths.

""Adventureland"" is recommended to those who enjoy understated, indie-style dramas that aren't heavy on simple answers and broad set-pieces.  It's a nice little tale with a handful of funny moments that should satisfy most people looking for a thoughtful, entertaining evening of home viewing.  There's even a little romance.

The movie looked and sounded fine on the standard DVD I watched, which also featured a small handful of interesting extras.",1301356800,,1346,5.286384976525822
3894309,3,B002BFBAWO,"""Adventureland"" is about summer jobs and finding your way in today's world.  The recent economic downturn is featured in family cut-backs and youth downsizing their dreams.  The main character is James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) who is somewhat shocked and disappointed when his father loses his job.  He had plans to go on a European vacation he dreamed of, and also plans to move to New York and go to a good college and make something of his life.  He has to take a poorly paying summer job at a local amusement park.  The movie has character studies of the amusement park workers and the dynamics.  They all share the same dopey job, wearing special T-shirts (""Games"" or ""Rides"").  There are some laughs in the dead-end jobs, and actually some preparation excercises for the real world.  The future of these kids did not seem that great, and a sad feeling came over me as I realized how many college-educated kids are out there looking for scarce well-paying jobs.  These kids just got high on weed or denial about futures.  The film is upbeat, but an underlying dread permeates this comedy/drama.  Boredom and no good-paying job opportunities are there for them and their parents.  The kids are touching and a bit of hope and love comes through at the end, but I look at the current financial mess the country is in and feel sorry for the characters.

""Adventureland"" is a film focused on youth, and made for them.  It is also an interesting peek into the changing times and the 21st Century youth culture for the empathetic older viewer.",1299456000,5,1542,4.705223880597015

Ryan Reynolds and Jon Hader have acted very well too. It is not a laugh out loud comedy but it's funny in some parts. It's not a feel good or touching romance but enjoyable none-the-less. It's not as raunchy as say Superbad but it has its moments. The plot is light. Yeah that's the word -- light. Too many references to drugs that were unnecessary in my opinion, they didn't add anything to the story. Parents were too cliched. Not a bad movie.",1298246400,,607,4.4774774774774775
3894311,3,B002BFBAWO,"`Adventureland' is a down beat comedy that follows a guy, called James, who works at an amusement park over the summer to earn enough money to go to University. He makes unlikely friendships amongst the geeks and misfits who he works with and strikes up a summer romance that comes with more than it's fair share of complications. The is set during the eighties and has an appropriate soundtrack to match and the outfits are one aspect that will raise more than one smile. The trailers I saw for this film portrayed it as an all out comedy film and whilst there are plenty of amusing moments, very few of them will have you laughing out loud. Maybe I was expecting more after seeing the trailer, but this is a pretty average film, it isn't horrendous, but it isn't really great either. The best bit of this film was the performance by Jesse Eisenberg, but to be honest I just saw him in `Zombieland' and he was even better in that than in this film; but if he wasn't in this film it would have been a whole lot worse. Overall this is an ok film and will while away just over an hour and a half, just don't have too high expectations and you should enjoy it just fine.

Its surprising in a way that I was actually expecting a Superbad type of film or one of those raunchy teen comedies, although there's a lot of sex talk and all those typical of a coming-of-age comedy, I thought the movie was effective in portraying the characters in a realistic way and the script was at least clever and interesting. I would have wanted the move to dig deeper into the relationship of the main characters, but probably not making it more complex is the movie's appeal.

3894314,3,B002BFBAWO,"(SPOILERS AHEAD!) Don't worry if you didn't see this movie in the theaters or haven't had a chance to rent it, because you've seen this movie before. Adventureland follows an old formula: boy meets girl. Boy and girl fall in love. Something happens that make boy and girl break up. Of course, they still love each other. Then something happens that brings boy and girl back together.

It's not that formulas are bad. Plenty of movies are based on the same concepts and ideas. For example: Something tragic happens to character X's family. Character X seeks revenge. Character X gets his revenge. Apply this formula one way and we get The Outlaw Josey Wales. Apply it in another way and we get Punisher: Warzone. The difference is the first movie had something to say and the second movie was an excuse to show explosions on the big screen.

Adventureland falls into the second category of a movie that has nothing to say. Greg Mottola, who directed Superbad, brought nothing new to a crowded genre of movies saying the same thing. It's Say Anything without the boom box. It's Jerry Maguire without the ""You had me at hello."" It's The Notebook without the notebook.

I could almost forgive Mottola for creating a movie that has no interest in being anymore than what it is. Not every film can have a defining moment that captures an audience's heart or defines a generation. However, every movie should have characters the audience cares about. There should be some connection between characters in a movie and the audience. Audiences wanted Marty McFly to get back to the future just as much as they wanted Biff to get his @ss kicked. We loved Marty; we hated Biff. However, we had a connection with Biff, because we have all known a Biff that we wanted to punch in the nose.

Mottola failed to create and develop characters that we care about one-way or the other. If James and Em get back together, that's fine. If they don't get back together, that's fine. If Mike is cheating on his wife, that's fine. If they all get hit by a bus, that's fine too. The impression is that Mottola doesn't care about his characters and if a director doesn't care about his characters then why should we? It's a shame, because the film has a very talented roster.

In the lead role of James is Jesse Eisenberg. James is the self-deprecating, uncomfortable, nerdy guy who is figuring out life. Eisenberg is perfect in the role. He has perfected this same character in other movies like Rodger Dodger and The Hunting Party. It was the same character he played in Zombieland (hmmm.....Adventureland to Zombieland. Coincidence? ).

Playing Eisenberg's love interest is Kristen Stewart...give me a moment to regain my composure.... Stewart plays Em, the girl that shows James the amusement park ropes. I will go on record right now saying, ""I like Kristen Stewart."" She reminds me of the girl in school (high school, GED classes, college) who is hotter than a three-alarm fire, but has a low self-esteem. You know the girl who covers everything, from the bangs that go past her eyes to the baggy clothes that cover everything else. The girl who thinks that she has to look weird and reject others before they can reject her. The girl who could have anyone, if she were to give it half a chance.

Of course, James falls deeply and madly in love with her before she even opens her mouth. I don't blame the guy; it's Kristen Stewart! However, there is not one single moment in the film that we can see a spark between the two of them. The movie goes from the two of them meeting and then jumps to them being in love. It just happens and we have to go along with it, because Mottola hasn't given us any other choice.

In this type of movie there is always something that tears the happy couple apart. Playing the wedge that comes between James and Em is Mike, played by Ryan Reynolds. I like Reynolds as an actor. He has talent and in movies like Adventureland, he gets to show it. Too often we see Reynolds in movies where he is the smart @ss or the class clown. I admit it; he does a great job in movies like Van Wilder, Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle, and Waiting. But, it's movies like Definitely, Maybe, The Nines, and The Amityville Horror that we really get to see Reynolds shine.

Mike, the amusement park's handy man, had an affair with Em. James freaks out after he learns that the two of them had something going on in the past. Of course, he doesn't want to see her again. This isn't the sad moment that it should be because Mottola has shoved on us a love connection between James and Em that we never believed in the first place. We still don't care when James realizes he made a mistake dumping a hottie like Kristen Stewart and tries to win her back.

The real gems in this movie are Bill Hader and Kristnen Wigg. You may remember Hader as Seth Rogen's cop partner in Superbad and Wigg from Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story. Both actors are hysterical as the owners of the amusement park where James and Em work. They steal every scene that they're in. Unfortunately, neither one of them are on screen long enough to save the movie.

You won't regret watching Adventureland, but there are better flicks that deserve your time.",1283817600,,5221,4.5495207667731625
3894315,3,B002BFBAWO,"Adventureland is definitely overrated.  It's a film intended *entirely* for young adults.  It has a few serious problems though.

For one thing, it completely lacks humor.  That wouldn't be so much of a problem if the storyline ever picked up and actually went somewhere interesting instead of being one of literally thousands of typical college teen movies released over the last 10 years involving the *same exact topics*.

Relationships obviously is the most popular topic covered here- partying, fitting in with crowds, and just having fun comes next.  It's become so predictable and completely unnecessary by this point that it adds up to a LOT Of useless storyline segments.  Instead of movie writers coming up with new material, they keep falling back into the same old routine of predictability, and that's a shame.

In this particular case, the entire storyline revolves around a young college man who takes a part time job at an amusement park, and while there he falls in love with two women.  He's actually more interested in one, while the other girl feels more like a mistake to him.

I don't find anything remotely funny about Adventureland either, especially some of the recurring bits (such as one kid kicking the other one in the crotch repeatedly- this isn't really funny to me).  Another segment shows the amusement park games being fixed, and paying customers finding out about it.  This felt like a really horrible missed opportunity for humor and storyline progression.  Awful writing here.

The writing has just become extremely bland by this point.  As a result this is a really bad storyline that doesn't even make an attempt to separate itself in a positive way from the rest of the college films out there.  What a shame.  A film you'll know exactly which direction it's going after the first 20 minutes.

I enjoyed all the Lou Reed material being heard throughout the film, and it's actually an amazing coincidence because I just got done listening to several Lou Reed albums myself, so the soundtrack was a welcome surprise.  Still, that's not enough to save some dreadful storytelling, so I recommend skipping Adventureland.  No adventure here, I'm afraid.",1280361600,,2187,4.988950276243094
3894316,4,B002BFBAWO,"Director Greg Mottola famously worked at a run-down amusement park in his younger years, and that transformative experience serves ""Adventureland"" well.  This flick goes for a quieter, deeper humor than Mottola's smash hit ""Superbad,"" but it is no less endearing.

It's somewhere in the later '80s, and James (Jesse Eisenberg) is a smart guy cursed with a) a liberal arts degree, b) parents who are unexpectedly financially strapped, and c) who lives in Pittsburgh.  (By the way - is it eerie or cool that Eisenberg stars in two movies with similar one-word titles, ""Adventureland"" and ""Zombieland,"" that are based in theme parks where he plays the Michael Cera role?)  To raise the cash to go to Columbia journalism school, James gets stuck with a terrible summer job at Adventureland - a place that puts the ""lack"" in lackluster.

The theme park is populated with a range of supporting characters that is as solid and pleasing as any ensemble has a right to be.  One of the problems with these sorts of films is that the supporting characters tend to be one-note archetypes.  That's definitely not the case here - the supporting cast is surprisingly original and defies expectations.

Take the park bombshell Lisa P. (Margaria Levieva).  We first see her in one of those Sexy Slow Walks through Adventureland as all the guys stop to watch her lick a Sno-Cone.  Every guy's first reaction is, ""I hope this is the actress who agreed to do a bit of nudity.""  Instead of being either a) a simple sexpot or b) a stuck-up rhymes-with-with coasting on her beauty, Lisa P. actually turns out to be cool-but-flawed - she even asks James his thoughts about God during a good pot-smoking session.  This is a real girl who just happens to be gorgeous - it's this kind of attention to detail that makes ""Adventureland"" a pleasure.

Much of the movie focuses on James trying to act on his obvious chemistry with Em (Kristen Stewart, ""Twilight"" saga).  James and Em are seriously into each other, but are kept apart by a variety of neuroses and conflicts.  In a lesser film, these two would be kept apart by silly misunderstandings that could be cleared up with a simple five-minute conversation - here, there are darker and deeper issues in play.  Whether these issues will be resolved takes time, and as a result we care about these two.

For those of us looking for a raunchy ""Superbad 2,"" ""Adventureland"" does not fit the bill.  Even though this is a funny movie, there are only a couple of laugh-out-loud moments.  For me, the funniest scene in the movie involves the park owners, Bobby and Paulette (Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig), as they confront a violent park patron - watching Paulette nonchalantly hand Bobby a baseball bat so he can defend the park's honor before returning to the finances was a perfect snapshot of the lives of these two entrepreneurs.  And there is a shot-to-the-groin scene toward the end of the movie that I found as hilarious as Homer Simpson did when he watched Hans Moleman's film, ""Football in Groin.""

It's formulaic but redeemed by the sweet characters and occasionally by the half-witty script. Incidentally, we meet Kirsten Stewart who has gone on to become a tween idol in the ""Twilight"" movies.

3894320,4,B002BFBAWO,"It's a rare movie that mixes references to literary and philosophical favorites like Trotsky, Gogol and Melville with repeated punches to the crotch of its protagonist, but these opposing poles manage to mark ""Adventureland"" as an ideal comedy for the more intellectually inclined viewers out there.  Taking viewers all the way back to 1987, writer-director Greg Mottola's semi-autobiographical comedy doesn't exactly boast a great deal of narrative drive, but its relaxed pace is perfectly suited to its highly personal storytelling.  It would be a mistake to describe the movie's overall tone as nostalgic, but it does provide a wistful and relatable take on the period in life when aspirations tend to collide with reality, along with the expected (yet still amusing) nods to 80's style and pop culture.  The formula is somewhat similar to that used in Mottola's previous effort, ""Superbad""--barrages of profanity, sex jokes, and youthful debauchery mixed with occasional doses of sentiment and self-realization--although this time out the balance is tilted noticeably more toward the latter elements.  Where many mainstream comedies seem desparate to get a laugh out of their audience, ""Adventureland"" is content to let the humor rise naturally from the interactions of the characters and smartly-written dialogue loaded with sarcasm, intellectual references, and big words.

""Adventureland"" centers around the plight of James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg), a sensitive recent college graduate who's just found out that his parents' finances won't accomodate either his planned trip to Europe or his graduate-school goals. James is marked early on as the type of idealistic dreamer who allows himself to fall for a girl he's been dating for a week and a half, reads poetry for pleasure, and aspires to write Dickens-styled travelogues exposing the state of the world around him (on a personal note, as something of an overeducated, underemployed pseudo-intellectual type myself, I was certainly able to empathize with James's situation as he tries to find his way in a world that has little use for his extensive knowledge of comparative literature and Renaissance studies).  Since James's education didn't provide him with too many marketable skils--he laments early on that he's even unqualified for manual labor--he's forced to take a decidedly menial position working the game stations at Adventureland, a dreary amusement park in suburban Pittsburgh run by an overly enthusiastic husband-and-wife team (Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, who bring their usual hilarity to relatively minor roles).  At the park, James finds himself surrounded mainly by a pack of doomed souls with little or no prospects, chiefly focused on getting through the day so they can numb at least a little of their pain with booze, weed, and sex.

Shortly after embarking on his job at Adventureland, James begins a tentative romance with his vaguely dark and troubled coworker Em (Kristen Stewart, aka the chick from the ""Twilight"" movies), who also happens to be carrying on a secret affair with Connell (Ryan Reynolds), a married wannabe musician making ends meet as the park's handyman.  Not surprisingly, some life lessons ensue, but they're laced with enough humor and a light enough touch to differentiate ""Adventureland"" from the mass of coming-of-age flicks out there.  It helps that the movie places an emphasis throughout on creating believable and multi-dimensional characters, as Mottola shows a clear affection (or at least sympathy) for most of the cast without idealizing them or minimizing their flaws.  Even Reynold's Connell, who routinely cheats on his wife and blatantly lies about his musical exploits, is presented less as a villain than as just another working stiff doing whatever he can to make his life tolerable. Likewise, James's Russian literature-loving friend Joel (Martin Starr) is portrayed as part endearing nerd and part aimless, pretentious slacker.

Like most great comedies, ""Adventureland"" succeeds because it gets the little things right, perfectly capturing both the myriad tiny indignities that come with dead-end service-industry jobs and the attempts that people in them make to transcend their seemingly dire circumstances.  The minimalistic, occasionally haunting score by Yo La Tengo is nicely complemented by a selection of period music both great (the Replacements make a couple of appearances, including a memorable use of ""Bastards of Young"" in the opening scene) and not so great (the constant playings of Falco's ""Rock Me Amadeus"" are used to further underscore the horrors faced by the park employees).  ""Adventureland"" definitely isn't the most ambitious movie ever made, but it draws viewers into its characters and their little world so well that it doesn't have to be.  Those familiar with the work of Judd Apatow and his collaborators (several of whom show up in supporting roles) would be well-served to check this movie out.",1277596800,3,4961,5.391472868217054

3894324,4,B002BFBAWO,"James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) has just graduated from Oberlin College with a degree in Comparative Literature, and is planning to take a month off to go to Europe before starting grad school at Columbia to study Journalism when he finds out from his parents that he will not have the money to go to Europe. So in an effort to make money during the summer before moving to Columbia. While there he falls for a free spirited girl he works with, Emily Lewin (Kristen Stewart).

Greg Mottola hit the big time as a director when he stepped up to adapt Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's script for a little movie that became Superbad for producer extraordinaire Judd Apatow. For his followup to that movie, Mottola decided to write a semi-autobiographical story of his life working at Adventureland on Long Island in New York. What was advertised was more of a comedy in the vain of Superbad, but what was delivered was a coming of age love story.

In reality, I think I am more happy now that I know that the movie is a coming of age love story rather than the raunchy comedy. The movie more or less defies convention, as it's main character, James, is a virgin not looking to have sex for the sake of loosing his virginity, but rather looking for his place. The fact that the main character isn't your typically sexually charged male nerd is, in itself, refreshing. And unlike most comedies of it's ilk, this movie is less concerned with punchlines as it is with developing it's characters. In the end, it's still the characters that make the movie, not the other way around.

The acting in this movie is great. Jesse Eisenberg, unfortunately seeming to be more and more typecast, still does the geek chic thing very well. Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, of course being SNL alumni and at the top of the current class, bring the funny. Martin Starr plays the conflicted friend Joel, a character not far off from his character in Freaks and Geeks, while Ryan Reynolds gives a performance that is very understated for his typically more flamboyant style. Kristen Stewart was the real surprise to me though. For most of the movie she really seemed to be just swimming through, but toward the end it really seemed as if the character bared her soul, and she did a great job at portraying that.

If there was a flaw in the film, it wouldn't be with the film itself, but rather with the advertising that made the film seem like something different than what it is. In actuality, that advertising short sold the film for those of us that would have been more interested in the actual finished product. I highly recommend this film for anyone who likes dramedy's and if you like movies that really let you into the film characters lives.

3894325,4,B002BFBAWO,"ADVENTURELAND will be enjoyed by those who go in with either no knowledge of the story, or those that thought it might be a comedy but quickly come to understand that it's much more than that.

More of a quirky summer romance than a laugh-out-loud comedy, Adventureland gets some surprisingly high marks for taking a tried and true genre and marketing it to young adults --  as well as those of us with a touch of gray --  who remember working the odd job in order to make money for school, and finding much more than just an income.

Director Greg Mottola springs into action again after his wildly successful teen comedy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superbad/dp/B000WZEZHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superbad</a>. Mottola proved his comedic talent in that flick, but here in Adventureland pulls back and gives us more of a bittersweet love story with a comedic shell.

For those of you who saw (and loved)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zombieland/dp/B002WY65W4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zombieland</a>, you'll definitely want to see Jesse Eisenberg in this film. Although he's not running for his life from brain-starved zombies, he is running toward a life as a man, trying to figure out where he's going and how he wants his life to pan out.

Kristen Stewart (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Into-the-Wild/dp/B001GMH8SI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Into the Wild</a>) plays the love interest. She's the perfect confused and embittered daughter of a recently remarried father and ""evil"" stepmother. Finding solace in the sexual declivities of a married maintenance man, Arlene (Stewart) sees a kind spirit in James (Eisenberg), and the two form a budding romance that rocks, shatters, and builds as they discover what each has to offer the other.

The entire film circles around James' need to earn some cash for college after his parents' finances fall apart. He finds the only job offered to him at an amusement park named, yep, Adventureland. It is run by Bobby (comedic superstar Bill Hader,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tropic-Thunder/dp/B001H5X7KC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tropic Thunder</a>) and his wife Paulette (Kristen Wiig,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knocked-Up/dp/B001CW7ZUS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knocked Up</a>). This park and it's workers are what makes for an interesting and occasionally funny mix. Bobby guides Adventureland with a quirky yet firm hand. The crew that helps run the park are as diverse as America itself, and often just as screwed up. One of them has been a long-time friend of James' and loves punching him in the groin. Another (known only as Lisa P) is the sexually desirable yet unknown virginal girl that all the guys lust after. And still another is an obviously mentally challenged security guard who is the knowledge-base about everyone and everything that goes on within (and around) the park.

As you can see, there's a lot going on, and not all of it is funny. In fact, if you go into the film thinking it's going to be SUPERBAD 2, prepare to be disappointed. Unfortunately, many of the previews gave that impression. Although there's comedy lightly (very lightly) sprinkled throughout, it's not what makes this movie go.

3894328,4,B002BFBAWO,"Upon hearing the movie's plot from a friend and the Twilight overnight sensation star Kristen Stewart, I really thought this is just another teenage flick. Although there are some cheeky scenes, it is still better than I expected.
The plot is very simple. James(Eisenberg) plays a typical high school graduate who has good grades and has a bright future. He dreams of going to the Big Apple and studying there. But he's broke. He ended up getting a job at a theme park called Adventureland. It kinda looks like a crappy job with kids vomiting, adults cheating for their kids and obnoxious teens on group dates. But when he finally meets his dream girl in co-worker Em (Stewart), everything changed. It isn't a typical teenage love story because there are some twists and conflicts like a secret love affair. (Spoiler, sorry.) Considering this is from Director Greg Mottola, this lacks hilarious scenes like those in Superbad or Knocked Up. But thanks to Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, who play the couple who runs the park, there are laugh-worthy scenes. There's also a tinge of indie vibe in this film with all those music (especially the music!), the lines and their clothes (that Games, Games, Games gray t-shirt).
The thing that impresses me most about this whole movie are both the performances of Eisenberg and Stewart. They fit the characters perfectly. They're so believable. You'll wonder if Eisenberg's really that awkward in real-life and Stewart showed she was just another confused kid.
It wasn't that outstanding or Oscar-worthy but what's important is that it entertained. If you liked Juno, you will definitely dig this.",1265068800,,1634,4.989010989010989

3894330,4,B002BFBAWO,"Upon graduating from college, James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) finds himself with a degree in Comparative Literature and Renaissance Studies - and little else of the stuff to build a successful life on.  Forced by financial constraints to move back in with his parents, James takes a summer job as a carny at a seedy amusement park known as Adventureland (the movie was shot at Pittsburgh`s Kennywood Park).  His fellow sufferers-in-purgatory include his even more geeky friend, Joel (Martin Starr); his tormentor from elementary school, Frigo (Matt Bush); the elusive girl-of-his-dreams, Emily (Kristen Stewart); hunky security manager, Mike (Ryan Reynolds), who, though married, has got a secret thing going on the side with Emily; sexy hot bombshell, Lisa P (Margarita Levieva); and, finally, two park supervisors played by SNL regulars Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, whose function is to add some understated goofiness to the movie's otherwise gently realistic tone.

Based partly on the experiences of writer/director Greg Mottola (who established his bona fides in the genre a few years back with ""Superbad""), ""Adventureland"" is one of those rare youth comedies in which the characters actually come across as real people and not as contrivances paying script-service to a typical coming-of-age story.  Mottola's flavorful script nicely captures the rhythms and tones of everyday speech.  In fact, much of the humor derives from the fact that James, fresh from his immersion in  liberal arts academia, often has a hard time reeling in his Ivy League phrasing and diction when engaging in everyday conversations with his fellow workers.

As James, the perpetually tongue-tied 23-year-old virgin who wears his heart on his sleeve, Eisenberg perfectly captures all the insecurity and awkwardness of a young man utterly inexperienced in the ways of love and romance.  In fact, there's not an unappealing performance from any member of the cast.  And perhaps because the characters are of a somewhat more advanced age here, Mottola never lets the teen-movie hijinks get out of hand despite many opportunities to do so.

Thanks to the movie's being set in 1987, the soundtrack provides a veritable treasure-trove of great, nostalgia-evoking tunes from that era (the highlight being Crowded House's incomparable ""Don't Dream It's Over"") to transport us back in time.

Badly marketed at the time of its release (the ads made it look like just another lame-brained, teen-raunch fest), ""Adventureland"" is a sweet, perceptive and heartwarming film that proves there's quite a bit of life left in that creaky old coming-of-age genre after all.",1264636800,2,2634,5.353510895883777
3894331,3,B002BFBAWO,"Adventureland' is a coming-of-age story set in suburban Pittsburgh circa 1987. Loosely based on recollections of writer-director Greg Mottola (who's well known for directing the entertaining adolescent comedy, 'Superbad'), it is more drama than comedy. Mottola jettisons the raunchiness we've come to expect from the typical teenage fare that pops up in the cinema today for a more intellectual and informed dissection of adolescent (or shall we say post-adolescent) vagaries.

The setting of Adventureland is a run down amusement park run by a goofy thirtyish couple who'll do anything to make a buck (people trying to win a prize by knocking a hat off a mannequin with a softball are unable to do so since the hats are glued to the mannequins' heads). The proprietors also save money by hiring high school and college students at minimum wage as they're unable to find a job anywhere else due to the faltering economy (Reagnomics doesn't appear to be working very well at that time). One of these young people is the film's protagonist, James Brennan, well played by Jesse Eisenberg. James was about to take a trip to Europe for the summer before going off to graduate school but after his father receives a demotion at work, his parents force him to find a job instead.

Mottola does an excellent job of depicting the atmosphere at the ramshackle park. From the outset, James is advised by his co-workers to attempt to obtain a job as a ride operator as opposed to working the game booths (there is a clear cut hierarchy, and working the 'rides' is much more preferable to the booths where the workers are often forced to deal with unsavory characters who often cheat while attempting to win a prize). James also has to endure the constant blaring of 'Rock Me Amadeus', the Falco hit from the 80s, over the park's loudspeakers.

What keeps Adventureland from becoming just another sitcom is the excellent interplay between the two witty friends, James and his sidekick, Joel, smartly played by the talented Martin Starr. Both these young men are bonded by their reliance on their intellect to compensate for their lack of success with the opposite sex. There are a good number of welcome literary allusions in Adventureland including discussions of such prominent authors as Dickens and Gogol.

Adventureland's other characters, however, are not as strong as its two principals. For starters, Kristen Stewart's 'Em' is not convincing as the troubled recent graduate who's going out with an 'older man'. The film's scenarist attempts to explain her confusion due to the influence of a petulant stepmother who comes across as an unsympathetic stereotype. Em has few moments where she seems to like herself at all. Ryan Reynold's 'Mike Connell' could have been an interesting character as the amusement park's mechanic and married man Em is having an affair with, but he has little on screen time and comes across as being a little too sympathetic for someone who is cheating on his wife (it would have been nice if he had a bit more of an 'edge' as well as more of detailed back story).

Other characters also are underdeveloped--the sexy ""Lisa P."" gets short shrift after her main claim to fame is gossiping about Mike and Em's affair, betraying the confidence she established with James. Joel's potential girlfriend is another petulant one-dimensional character who rejects him after she experiences pressure from her strict Catholic family. I did like Hader and Wiig as the amusement park owners who provide the film with its main comic relief.

What I couldn't buy at all was the idea that Em would be attracted to James (along with Lisa P. who is portrayed as being able to get any guy she wants). James is simply too immature and a 'nice guy' for a woman like Em (who has just had an affair with the super-attractive, 'bad boy' mechanic) to be attracted to. So it's a real stretch when James comes to New York and Em is basically waiting for him with open arms. The old axiom 'nice guys finish last' holds true for all potential male suitors but Adventureland opts for the sentimental ending which rejects the reality of contemporary courtship patterns.

For all its deficiencies, Adventureland still manages to entertain, with its witty dialogue and top notch performance by Jesse Eisenberg who strikes the right notes as the beleaguered post-adolescent taking his first steps toward prescient adulthood.",1264464000,,4412,4.938005390835579

Very pleasant, occasionally quite funny, and with more smarts than its typical coming of age brethren, Adventureland is a good one for teens and anyone who longs for those times, or the mid-80s (as if we thought that was possible back then!).

I related to a fair bit of this, as I also got out of high school at that time. The Madonna fashions, big hair, etc. are a time trip, but what makes this worth watching is a good, believable script and solid performances from all of the principles. This has cult written all over it. It's also full of funny cigarettes, so parents beware: this could be the gateway movie that ruins your childrens' lives completely.

*Note about the AUDIO COMMENTARY: It says that it's commentary with director Greg Mottola and actor Jesse Eisenberg but might as well just be the director. The director CONSTANTLY talks and rarely allows Eisenberg to get a word in which pisses me off because there are a lot of scenes where I wanted the actors perspective or input and the director just keeps talking and talking about mostly nonsense. I know the commentary isn't the most important thing compared to everything else but if I was Jesse Eisenberg, I'd want to talk about my first major motion picture role instead of the director cutting me off and talking about BS half the time.

I really wanted to love this film but I thought it was just okay at best - it fell below average as both a comedy and a drama. And by the time the compromise was met the film was over.

As much as is not really the most important thing for a film to have characters that are relate-able or likable or not...these characters were simply pretty hard to care about.

Romantic inexperience or not the James character was just kind of stupid with deep insecurity issues and turned out to be a verbally-abusive jerk to boot (this didn't add depth to the character so much as maker him easy to dislike). Just because someone isn't a man-of-the-world with women doesn't automatically mean that they are completely insensitive and unlikable fools. This kind of deflated things just a bit, and no, by making him unlikable they didn't make things any more realistic. The characters in this film were all somewhat on the self-centered side of things, which made me feel as though it was an adult's version of a teenager (oh, of course the teenage Kristen Stewart character is having an affair with the married Ryan Reynolds character) and somewhat inauthentic. And the whole subplot involving antisemitism was just an unnecessary eye-roller.

Those expecting a comedy may feel short changed.  Comic elements surround a bittersweet but ultimately satisfying core story and prevent it from getting too dark.

On one hand, I was disappointed at its lack of humor.  On the other hand, I was amazingly impressed with the depth of the storyline.  If you get this movie, go in knowing a few things:

-First, this movie isn't another ""Superbad"" funny movie.  It has a few good laughs, but all-in-all, it's a pretty serious movie.  Don't be fooled by the trailer, especially the ""red band"" version""

-Second, serious isn't a bad thing.  For me, it brought to light a lot of interesting thoughts about love, partying, and even religion.  If you go in recognizing that there is something deeper in the plot, you'll enjoy the movie so much more.

-Last,  the movie had an amazing cast.  The unknown Jesse Eisenberg puts out a good name for himself, and Kristen Stewart looks spectacular.  If you're a guy, you'll be teased, but pleased.

Many viewers may at first be surprised by this film and find it slow and lacking in the expected hilarity.  When the promotion work was done on this film it was a marketing travesty.  This film is directed by Greg Mottola of SUPERBAD fame, a film which redefined the comedy genre.  When one thinks of SUPERBAD it is associated with KNOCKED UP, PINEAPPLE EXPRESS and ROLE MODELS.  These films were tender tales told with over the top, in your face hilarity.  I adore these films and own them all.  They are classics.  But ADVENTURELAND was promoted as if it was in this genre and it totally is not.  The tender story of James is the center and there is heartfelt drama and emotion wrapped around this unique blend of honest characters and low scored humor.  The humor is underplayed and always there but not in an over the top way.

James has his life all planned out, just graduated from high school and finds out that his college fund no longer exists so he must get a summer job.  The only work available is at the tacky amusement park ADVENTURELAND.  The cast is amazing and the story is told intimately in the vein of a small indie film.  James falls for Em, the ever talented Kristen Stuart.  Ryan Reynolds effectivelty underplays his role of the park gigolo.  Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader from SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE are hilarious as the owners of the park but for me most of the laughts come from the very underrated Wendie Malick who plays James mother.

This film is a gentle coming of age story with very real characters.  It is not an over the top laughfest but instead a tender drama filled with charmed laughs.  If you find this movie to not be what you expected don't give up on it and give it a second viewing.  I guarantee it will grow on you.  It grew on me so much I had to purchase it.

This film takes place in the mid 80s and is true to the time preriod.  There is a classic soundtrack and everything else from scenery to props are right on point.  The blu ray version has a very impressive 1080p high def transfer that show colors with immense clarity and treats darks with class.  Audio is also superb.  This film has a story to tell and with each viewing you will grow fonder and fonder of the characters and its humor and grace will become a huge part of the films charm.

Basically, low self-esteem in front of others with nervous stuttering and goofy/cool response in awkward situations. Also, the amusement park is itself a character. It reminds me of my childhood days at Johnstone Park (Kiddie Park- Bartlesville, OK) which had rides that you can pay in $0.10 tickets. I love Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader in this film which are deadpans of the managers who have to deal with summer job kids.

The DVD has a nice ""making the film"" short which has interviews with all the characters. It also goes into how the amusement park was selected and the storyline from the writer/director. By the end of the film, it gets a little cheesy but it's a romance comedy so expect more of the same as ""Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist"".",1254614400,,1523,4.682835820895522

The film has an excellent cast who all can handle comedy and drama well. I have only seen Eisenberg in a few films, but he shows he is an interesting and capable actor. I liked this film very much and its charming run down amusement park setting with a cool 80's soundtrack will certainly spark memories for those of us old enough to remember those times.",1254182400,3,522,4.447916666666667
3894378,5,B002BFBAWO,"ADVENTURELAND is Greg Mottola's directorial follow-up to SUPERBAD  But it's not a laugh-out-loud comedy, despite the facts that Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig are on hand as park managers and the lead character keeps getting hit in the balls by the annoying childhood friend he can't quite shake off.  It's a movie Kristen Stewart shot before TWILIGHT.  But this time around, she's not falling for a dark, mysterious and brooding hero.

What is ADVENTURELAND?  It's a charming, well-acted, intelligently written and highly enjoyable coming-of-age story set at a 1980s amusement park.

Jesse Eisenberg gives a fine performance as James Brennan, the virginal, insecure, awkwardly intelligent college grad who takes a summer job at Adventureland when his parents' financial troubles force him to cancel his European summer plans.  Kristen Stewart shines as Em, the girl he falls for but who happens to be involved with the park's married maintenance guy.  Stewart makes her character believably screwed up, both in her home life and in how she compartmentalizes and balances her dueling summer relationships.  Meanwhile, Ryan Reynolds makes Mike, the maintenance guy, a tightly wound bundle of emotions, playing him as an aging town stud who understands that while most of the young people who surround him may enjoy a summer of fun, games and meaningless rides, he's the only one who'll be doing it all again next summer.

There's a great supporting cast and a fun '80s soundtrack, too.

So don't expect SUPERBAD.  But if you do go along for the ride, be prepared to for something super good.",1254096000,8,1587,5.108527131782946

3894380,1,B002BFBAWO,"This movie is flat out bad. I'm not usually one to write one-star reviews, but this movie is so bad it deserves my time. First of all, aside from Kristen Stewart, the acting is terrible. Jesse Eisenburg's character is so cliche and uninteresting; and that's if you can understand him because he talks so fast. As for Ryan Reynolds, he is out of place and his acting is virtually the same as all of his other movies. The plot itself is an interesting story, but the writers failed to expound on the mystique that surrounds amusemant parks. They could have developed the characters quite a bit more and broken the stereotypes. But they didn't and we're left with an awkward college grad; a teenage girl with issues; a tease; a prettyboy dog; and the amusement park owners who are just in the movie for comic relief, all of which add up to an overused and unrealistic cast. I feel like the editors even got so bored with this movie they just kind of slapped everything together and packaged it with Kristen Stewart's and Ryan Reynolds' name knowing they would turn a profit regardless of the quality of the movie. I tried to give this movie a chance but after viewing it I was sorry I did so.",1254096000,4,1189,4.483870967741935
3894381,5,B002BFBAWO,"As you've no doubt heard, Adventureland was marketed as a teenage comedy in the vein of Superbad. Despite sharing the same director Greg Mottola (who also wrote this film), the two have little in common. In fact, Adventureland has more of a kinship with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-the-Real-Girls/dp/B00009ZPTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All the Real Girls</a>&nbsp;than Superbad. This is not a sex comedy or a teen-drug movie (although it does have drug content). Adventureland is a coming-of-age story that is much better than that description seems to imply. If you're expecting a hilarious comedy, this is not the movie for you as much of it's humor is more amusing and subtle as opposed to hilarious.

The year is 1987 and James (Jesse Eisenberg) is planning a graduation trip to Europe before he begins attending grad school in New York City. However, when James' parents fail to come through with the money for his trip, he's forced to get a summer job in Pittsburgh at Adventureland. There, he meets Emily (Kirten Stewart), an intriguing, yet withdrawn girl who can't commit due to an ongoing affair with Adventureland's custodian Connell (Ryan Reynolds).

This weak synopsis I've provided sounds like a typical ""summer love"" story but Mottola's a much better writer than that. He creates real, fleshed-out characters and never resorts to character cliches to present them. These characters are confused, passionate, intelligent...They have depth; something rarely found in these kinds of movies. Look at the relationship between James and Emily for evidence of this. Their relationship is touching, heartfelt, and genuine; a rarity for almost any movie let alone a comedy.

The movie takes place in the 1980s, but this is simply a nostalgic background for a story that is not confined to any particular time period. There's a broad range of emotions on display here due to both clever writing and impressive performances.

The stand-out here is Kirsten Stewart, who has been appearing in movies since a young age but has only recently found fame with her role in the Twilight series. Stewart displays real acting chops here, capturing the tough, withdrawn nature of her character in a way not every young actress could. She's a charmer, but you can see her as the kind of girl that lets you in just enough to have less of a distance to push you out. Eisenberg perfectly embodies the opposite of her character in his performance as James, which would be easier to applaud if I had seen Eisenberg play a character different from this one. He seems very comfortable at this point playing characters filled with virginal angst.

Bill Hader, as Adventureland's manager Bobby, seems to serve as the character with the funniest bits. His periodical outburts at people who don't properly dispose of their trash at the park are hilarious. Shockingly enough, Ryan Reynolds turns in a straight-forward performance dropping the Van Wilder-shtick he's seemingly carried over into every film he's done since that one.

In short, Adventureland really surprised me. Movies of this sort with realistic, well-drawn characters are really becoming obsolete and Adventureland does almost everything right. It's not a masterpiece but I enjoyed it so much I can't even pick out it's flaws. For this genre, it's a really great movie. It's really sad that this film doesn't have a wider audience and it certainly deserves one. If you watch this with an open mind, not expecting 'Superbad Redux' I think you'll find Adventureland to be a diamond in the rough; amusing and surprising in so many different areas.

3894382,5,B002BFBAWO,"Adventureland is a small film that takes hold of you in a big way. First, this movie is not for everyone. If you are expecting the wild antics and R-rated slapstick of Superbad, you'll probably be disappointed. Since this film was marketed to the Superbad audience, I felt confused during the first twenty minutes of the film. No worries: once the characters catch fire and the the back story is explained Adventureland soars.

Adventureland mirrors my past: I went to college in the eighties, worked a lousy min. wage job and partied in the same cavalier way. This little movie nails this aspect of life (my life, anyway) better than any film I've seen.

The basic plot of boy (young man) gets a part time job he hates and finds a beautiful girl he loves is nothing new. The attention here is in the nuanced details: the laser accurate acting and poetic cinematography.

The eighties soundtrack fits perfectly (the Cure's Just Like Heaven and INXS' Don't Change come instantly to mind.) Kristin Stewart  (a talented young leading actress who is not a bimbo) as Em steals the show. In one memorable scene, Velvet Underground's Pale Blue Eyes plays as she drives our hero (Jesse Eisrnberg)home. Em's face and light blue eyes shine with a vulnerability that is both endearing and heart wrenching.

This film is a thoughtful one that is filled with metaphors (the amusement park rides, games and setting are life) and irony (the disparity between what we think we know about someone and who or what they actually are.)

Adventureland's most thought provoking message: Those youthful days (and nights) within the framework of jobs we hated were the happiest times of our lives...

Highly recommended for fans of Catcher in the Rye, Almost Famous, John Hughes films and the kinder and gentler moments in Judd Apatow movies.",1254009600,3,1818,4.864077669902913

It covers no new ground---we've all seen this type of ""1970s-summer-romance/coming-of-age"" story before, with a healthy dollop of ""endearing-geek-gets-really-beautiful-girl.""  Yet it shows admirable restraint in not going over the top with the geek-chic (unlike ""Napoleon Dynamite"") and the characters are both familiar and somewhat original at the same time.  So despite faithfully following certain narrative conventions of this genre, it manages to retain a sufficiently redeeming amount of authenticity and realism.  For instance when the two leads finally get it on, they don't just effortlessly and flawlessly shed their clothes and melt into each other's arms as most films would have it---there is still a lot of tentativeness and awkwardness on both of their parts, and the camera cuts away before the fireworks even really start.

And of course the fact that Kristen Stewart, probably thanks to some masterful makeup and lighting and camera angles, looks strangely exquisite here (especially in the night-time profile shots of her driving) doesn't exactly hurt, LOL.",1253232000,,1343,5.5911330049261085

Imagine a movie set at an amusement park that is neither amusing nor funny. The sort of movie that 3/4 of the way through it you're wondering when the plot will begin. And the climax, such as it is, occurs only because the end credits were ready to roll. The simple story: several teens or twenty-somethings (they seemed to have no problem getting served at bars) still live with their distant / dysfunctional / alcoholic parents while they pass the time between furtive trysts by smoking marijuana. This is the kind of movie where two characters have one or two chaste encounters, and we're supposed to assign some deep bond between them (something the movie is too lazy to provide).

Watching the extras only cemented this view. (oh, and the main female character's name was ""Em"" - go figure) Most of the intimate behavior was only believable if you imagined it being between gay guys, otherwise, it was just weird and uncomfortable. I had only seen Superbad and hadn't known who directed it, so I watched it on the strength of that mention plus the funny preview. So of course I slogged through it waiting for its quality to shine through, which unfortunately never did.

3894394,3,B002BFBAWO,"There is an unmistakable ramshackle and unfocused feel to this coming of age comedy about the pains and pleasures of working a thankless summer job, and it suits the movie quite nicely.  The plot, in a nutshell, follows a summer in the life of James, a teen who finds himself forced to take a job in a rundown amusement park in Pittsburgh after his parents suffer a financial setback that won't allow them to pay his way through college.  James is played by Jesse Eisenberg as a neurotic, insecure, niave and ultimately likeable kid not unsimilar to the many characters played by Michael Cera.  In fact, somebody should put the two of them in a movie together as brothers or cousins or something.  But I digress.

Adventureland follows James as he gets a reality check about working a crappy job to pay for college, forms friendships with the other oddball park employees and falls in love with Em, played by Kristen Stewart.  The movie is at its best when it sticks to the details of what it's like to work at an amusement park; the rigged games, angry patrons, rides that bread down and the general camaraderie that the employees develop as they just hang out with one another.  During these vignettes, Adventureland is an engagingly askew comedy.  It doesn't really have any focused center.  It's just about being young, hanging out and hoping that the future works out.

The movie is less successful when it focuses on the romance between James and Em.  Eissenberg and Stewart are a likeable couple, but they never really feel all that convincing.  I for one never beleived that their feelings for one aonther went that deep so the subplots about Em's affair with Ryan Reynolds' character or James' date with coworker Melissa P. never really added much to the mix.  If anything, they were a distraction from the film's comedic center and they took time away from hilarious supporting players such as Martin Starr and Bill Hader.

Nevertheless, with it's scruffy appeal, smart and funny dalogue and cool soundtrack (The Replacements and Lou Reed figure prominently in the mix), Adventureland is ultimately an enjoyable movie that leaves you feeling that it could have been something more.",1251676800,2,2191,4.839142091152815

1987, Pennsylvania; James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) has just graduated college and is ready to embark on his long awaited European tour before going on to grad school in New York in the fall. Unfortunately James' father has been transferred into a much lower paying position which results in the summer trip being canceled and his ability to attend grad school is in question also. James hasn't reached the bottom yet however as he has to get a summer job and with his lack of experience the only thing currently available is a position as a game operator at the local amusement park Adventureland with his former best friend Frigo. The job is less than satisfactory but James does take interest in his co-worker Em (Kristen Stewart) so maybe the job won't be a complete waste of time...

Adventureland was a great movie but isn't going to be for everyone. Adventureland wasn't a basic Rom/Com as it didn't employ the typical over the top slapstick comedy and instead relied on a slightly smarter brand of humor combined with some crude humor.

The Good: Great performances from all the actors/actresses and the move was well cast. I thought Kristen Stewart's take on her character was great. The character is very flawed and Kristen nailed it. The same can be said for Jesse's portrayal of James. The time in which the story takes place was an interesting choice and worked well and also provided a great soundtrack. Loved the humor in this movie and that it didn't rely on trite slap stick or completely on crude humor.

The Bad: Nothing memorable.

3894400,5,B002BFBAWO,"""Adventureland""  is the bittersweet story of James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg, ""The Squid and the Whale"") who, on graduating from college in 1987, looks forward to traveling through Europe that summer and attending Columbia University's grad school in the fall.  These plans are dashed when his parents (Wendy Malick, Jack Gilpin) inform him that his father was recently demoted and they no longer can afford to pay for the European trip. In addition, to help pay for grad school, he'll have to get a summer job in his home town of Pittsburgh.
 Rebuffed by several potential employers because of his lack of experience, James finally gets a job at a local amusement park, Adventureland, operated by Paulette and Bobby (Kristen Wiig, Bill Hader).  Mike Connell (Ryan Reynolds) is the park's maintenance man, a bit older than the college age employees, and rumored to have rubbed shoulders with show biz types.
 Though marketed as a wild and freewheeling teen comedy, ""Adventureland is actually a drama.  Sure, it has its funny moments, some based on the antics of ""Saturday Night Live"" veterans Wiig and Hader, others based on romantic awkwardness and James' journey from child to young adult.  Eisenberg has an endearing, puppy-dog screen persona that works perfectly here.  We immediately sympathize with him when his plans are suddenly thrown into turmoil, and are impressed at his ability to accept a bad break and make the best of a tough situation.
 Kristen Stewart (""Twilight"") plays James' love interest and Martin Starr (""Knocked Up"") is the wisecracking nerd.  The soundtrack turns the clock back to 1980's Top 40, with music by The Cure, David Bowie, Crowded House, INXS, Lou Reed, and more.
 Bonus extras include deleted scenes, a making-of featurette, commentary by director Greg Mottola and Eisenberg, and a digital copy of the film.  Exclusive on the Blu-ray release are ""Welcome to Adventureland,"" a collection of the park's commercials, orientation training video, and drug policy; and a satirical behind-the-scenes featurette.",1251244800,,2041,5.226993865030675
3894411,5,B002BFBAWO,"In 2009,  writer and director Greg Mottola's (""Superbad"", ""Arrested Development"" and ""Undeclared"") film ""Adventureland"" was released in theaters and for the most part, received positive reviews from the film critics.  Now the film receives its High Definition treatment via Blu-ray (which includes a digital copy) and also a DVD release.

The film takes place in the 80's and revolves around James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg, ""The Village"" and ""Solitary Man""), a Comparative Literature major who graduated from Oberlin College and plans to pursue his undergraduate degree at Columbia University but first, celebrate his graduation by taking advantage of his family's gift to send him to Europe over the summer.

Unfortunately, his father (Jack Gilpin, ""21', ""Law & Order"") was moved to a new department which pays less money than his previous job and thus his mother (Wendie Malick, ""Just Shoot Me!"", ""Fillmore"", ""Frasier""),  break the news to him that the money saved for the trip is now gone, nor can they pay for his college.

So, now James must save up money for his trip to Europe by looking for a job.  Unfortunately, finding a job has been too difficult and leaves him with his last resort, working at the local summer theme park known as ""Adventureland"" and is under the constant eye of his boss Bobby (Bill Hader, ""Saturday Night Live"", ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"") and his wife Paulette (Kristin Wiig, ""Saturday Night Live"", ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"").

James ends up working with Russian Literature major and all-round nerd Joel (Martin Starr, ""The Incredible Hulk"", ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"", ""Superbad"" and ""Knocked Up""); his former childhood best friend Tommy Frigo (Matt Bush, ""Halloween II"") who is now more of a jerk (and for some apparent reason, keeps hitting James in the nads); the technician and musician Mike Connell (Ryan Reynolds, ""The Proposal"", ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine""); the Lou Reed fan Em Lewin (Kristen Stewart, ""Twilight"" films) and the sexy Lisa P (Margarita Levieva, ""Spread"" and ""Vanished"").

While working at Adventureland, James begins a friendship with his co-workers and eventually gets invited to Em's party. While at the party, the two end up hitting it off and James becomes smitten with her, but he is unaware that Em and Mike Connell have some sort of relationship behind-the-scenes, despite Mike being a married man.

And it's hard for anyone to look down on Mike Connel.  It appears that everyone at Adventureland looks up to Connell.  Especially with rumors that he played guitar with Lou Reed, let alone being popular with the women who think he is a rock star.  So, naturally for James (who has not had much experience with girls or dating), he starts to go to Connell for love advice.

But through his summer job at Adventureland, James learns a lot about himself, about love but also the pain of being in love.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Adventureland"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1) and cinematographer Terry Stacey (""Sex and the City"", ""P.S. I Love You"" and ""Wanderlust"" does a good job in bringing the look of the 1980's to film.  One thing that people will notice is the amount of grain on the film.  For those who love the film look, the film definitely retains its grain and shows no sign of DNR (Digital Noise Reduction).

For the most part, the film is shot outdoors at a theme park and is shot primarily during the day, thus you get a good amount of color during those sunny days.  While night time shots are either at the amusement park, inside a car or inside a home.  For the most part, blacks are nice and deep and of course, there is shadowing but its typically due to the lighting of the amusement park.  But overall, ""Adventureland"" is a film that looks good and the grain definitely gives the film a sort of nostalgic look to it.

As for the audio, the film is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD (48 kHz/24-Bit) and also French 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The film is primarily dialogue driven and music-based film.  Dialogue is clear and understandable through the front and center channels while popular 80's music is a big plus for this film and will definitely be appreciated for those who grew up during this time.  Although the film does not utilize major sound effects, there are scenes such as fireworks during July 4th that really sound nice and poppy through your front and surrounds.

Subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

For those who are interested in ""Adventureland"", one may think that Director Mottola is back with another ""SuperBad"" style of movie but  I just want to emphasize that although ""Adventureland"" does have many humorous elements and the fact that there is a lot of scenes with the characters smoking weed, ""Adventureland"" is very much a love story.  Call it a genuine romantic comedy.

What makes this film quite enjoyable is its colorful cast of characters and its wonderful music.  It can easily be called an 80's-style film, pot film (definitely not a hardcore stoner film) but the characters are what makes this film so enjoyable.  You can easily remember Tommy Frigo and his crazy nad hitting antics, Lisa P's sexy 80's dance moves, Joel trying to understand James and how he was able to become closer with Em and even Adventureland managers Bobby and Paulette who are just crazy in their own way.

As for the main talent, Jesse Eisenberg was just perfect as James Brennan.  Eisenberg does a great job portraying the awkward Brennan and how he grows as a person throughout the summer.  Kristen Stewart also is a natural in playing the role of Em and bringing that sense that she's a troubled teen and showing us that she has more to offer outside of her popular role in ""Twilight"" (note: Stewart filmed ""Adventureland"" before filming ""Twilight"" but the latter came out in theaters first).

As for Ryan Reynolds, his character as Mike Connell is a bit hard to read at first but you eventually see his true colors as the film progresses.  I sort of look at him as a man stuck within his former self of what he could have been but now thrives on being popular to those at the theme park and those people making him out better than he truly is.

But for the most part, the characters seem real and genuine, thus making the film much more enjoyable.  As a romantic comedy, it's not the best but it's hard to deny the captivating storyline.  I really enjoyed watching this film!

As for the music, ""Adventureland"" is a film that showcases popular 80's music such as Falco's ""Amadeus"", David Bowie's ""Modern Love"", The Cure's ""Just Like Heaven"", The Outfield's ""Your Love"", INXS's ""Don't Change"", Expose's ""Point of No Return"",  and many more.  So, it was great to see how music was utilized in the film, especially Falco's ""Amadeus"" (since most of us who grew up at that time know how this song was overplayed).

As for the Blu-ray release, as mentioned, the Blu-ray comes with a digital copy of the film and the special features (which are unrated) are quite entertaining.  From ""Frigo's Taps"" and learning about various ways on how to hit someone in the nads was definitely unexpected.  Also, to see a featurette based on the character of Lisa P and showcasing her 80's fashion style was quite interesting.

Overall, I enjoyed ""Adventureland"" for being an enjoyable romantic comedy.  A pretty entertaining storyline, intriguing and genuine characters and fabulous music made this film so enjoyable!

For those looking for a fun, highly entertaining, young adult romantic comedy especially a film that showcases music from the 80's, definitely give ""Adventureland"" a try.",1251244800,2,9980,4.9033412887828165
3894412,4,B002BFBAWO,"From Superbad helmer Greg Mottola comes Adventureland, a coming of age saga disguised as a teen comedy, just like Superbad was before it.  And just like Superbad once again, Adventureland proves to be a better than expected film that is both heartfelt and plenty funny.  Jesse Eisenberg stars as James, a down on his luck college grad who gets shuffled off to Pittsburgh and stuck with a summer job at the amusement park from which the film gets its title.  He finds a kindred spirit in Em (Kristen Stewart), and finds himself well liked among his fellow co-workers, including his bosses (Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig) and other eccentrics (Ryan Reynolds and Martin Starr among others).  As time unfolds, James learns a few life lessons along the way; many of which he definitely doesn't see coming.  In between all of this drama however are some definite funny moments, and despite all the teen dramedy, Adventureland never comes off as pretentious or boring.  The cast is good and there's some great dialogue as well, with the end result being the film being something that is incredibly hard not to like.  All in all, Adventureland is something that is definitely worth your time, and once again like Superbad before it, is a different sort of teen comedy that those who don't like the typical teen comedy will actually manage to enjoy.",1251158400,,1338,4.816593886462882
3894413,5,B002BFBAWO,"When I went to see this movie, I thought I was going to end up seeing something like Superbad, and though I loved Superbad as a movie about High School, this was ten times better in every aspect.  Maybe its my personality, maybe its because I had been dating a girl that looked like Em (from how she carried herself, responsed to things, and the such), maybe because I was finishing up with college after having started in a Community college because my dad lost his job, and my college fund had to help the family, and then I transfered to a four year state college.  Maybe it was because I had gotten accepted to Columbia for a journalism program.  I don't know.  But not one moment of this film rang false.  I met every solitary character in the movie.  I dated a girl just like Em, I knew a married musician who made up stories of people he opened for (he did eventually open for a band at the Centrum), I have a jewish friend who majored in Russian Literature before going for a Master degree as an archivist.

This film was so emotionally real to me, I have waited for its release since it left the theaters.  I saw it six times in the theaters.

This is the movie for post college malaise, we all feel it, we all go through it, we're all still just searching for who we are, what we're going to do, and how we're going to become successful in life.  Chasing dreams, finding ourselves, looking for love.  This movie has all of it.  Its funny, its sad, its brilliant, its powerful, its worth every minute that I've sat through it, every penny that I spent watching it.  If you've graduated college, are going to college, want a movie that reminds you of younger days, of jobs you hate, of girls you love, of friends you leave, of chasing dreams, and of following your heart, this movie is for you to watch.  I don't know how to sell the movie anymore than that, and I don't think I should have to.

Ignore the previews, ignore the advertising, focus on the movie itself, go in expecting nothing, and you'll come out with everything.  This movie is wonderful, important, and just overall, an everything that I've ever looked for in a film.  It left that sour feeling in my stomach for the girl I lost out on by not going after her, it made me remember those early days when I worked with friends at stupid jobs that I couldn't stand, it made me remember how the things you think are going to be horrible in life, can actually explain your life to you more than everything you think will be great.",1250985600,,2500,4.330472103004292

I saw this wonderful film in the theatres FOUR times!

The costs were for getting the Blu Ray player. :)

I wouldn't had minded including a regular DVD as well like Disney does with their other titles.",1250899200,,368,4.154929577464789
3894415,5,B002BFBAWO,"The initial backlash from customers expecting an entirely different film will subside I believe, as long as people go into this expecting nothing of what was advertised. The trailers and ad promos campaign this as being a laugh-a-minute follow up to this cast and crew's other films, when actually it covers the twenty-something angst of finding one self (and love) while working in a less than stellar environment (with a few good laughs in the middle).

The Blu picture looked good, and the DTS was great for the 80s music and funland/carnival style sounds. What gives this a higher rating is the amount of work put into the extras, even though some of them suck and are unfunny, it does not disqualify the time they put into these.
* Frigo's Taps (excl. to Blu) - the whack guy gets his few minutes to show how to master the tapping of a man's region, was actually funnier than the movie - be sure to watch until the end when the director gets him back - my favorite was the drive-by tap.
* Lisa Fashion Tips (excl. to Blu) - irritating, skip it.
* Welcome To Adventureland, Orientation and Drug Policy Videos (excl. to Blu) - close to what one saw if you watched Waiting. Some funny moments, but dry. They are all filmed with a retro feel and degraded film stock.

On all versions:
* 3 minutes of deleted scenes, forgettable.
* Making of - lasts 17 minutes and has the standard fare on logistics, production and cast selection reasoning.
* Picture/Music option - allows you to go to the scene directly as sorted by the song being played.

Once I saw what kind of film it was regarding themes and type of ""comedy"", I was alright with rating it higher. The ending was unrealistic, but kudos to the prop department for doing a solid job on recreation of the period. 3 1/2 for the film, 1 1/2 for the Blu pic, supplements and sound.",1250812800,,1832,4.479041916167665
3894416,5,B002BFBAWO,"""Just My Life: The Making of Adventureland"" takes a look at how this film came together. It was based on Mottola's actual experiences working at an amusement park on Long Island during the summer of 1985. He talks about the casting of Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart who, in turn, talk about their characters. The producers briefly mention how they were able to find a vintage amusement park. Also included is behind-the-scenes footage and clips from the film.

There are three deleted scenes with optional commentary from writer/director Greg Mottola and actor Jesse Eisenberg. We get more of the theme park's managers played with killer comic timing by Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig. There is also an additional scene between James and Connell. Mottola puts this footage in context with the rest of the film and briefly explains why it was cut.

Finally, there is an audio commentary with Mottola and Eisenberg. They banter back and forth with a lot of self-deprecating humor. Mottola says that he didn't want to make an ""'80s kitsch-fest"" and recounts some of his own experiences working at a theme park in his youth and how it informed the film. Eisenberg chimes in with the occasional comment and asks Mottola questions about the film. This is a very chatty track as they dish all sorts of trivia and filming anecdotes.",1250812800,2,1326,4.888888888888889
3894417,4,B002BFBAWO,"""Adventureland"" is a mildly sweet comedy-drama in the ""coming of age"" genre of films written and produced by Greg Mottola (the director of ""Superbad"") and based on his own experiences working at an amusement park in the late 1980s.  The film is set in the same era, giving it a somewhat timeless feel and tone that makes it look and feel as though it were made in that same era.  The storyline of diminished expectations, coming to terms with post-collegiate life, and the evolution and changing nature of friendships are similarly universal and timeless.  The story follows James Brennan (wonderfully underplayed by Jesse Eisenberg), a college grad whose life is rapidly changing.  His girlfriend breaks up with him and he returns home with hopes of touring Europe followed by Grad school only to discover his parents can't pay for either due to a change in economic circumstances.  James moves in with his parents and realizes his only ticket to grad school is a summer job, but his comparative lit degree leaves his employment options limited.  Desperate, he takes a job at the Adventureland amusement park, the latest in a series of blows to his psyche.

Most of the film revolves around the odd cast of characters James encounters while working at Adventureland.  They become his new cohort of friends and a romance slowly blossoms between James and Emily (Kristen Stewart).  But all isn't as it seems as Emily is also involved with the worldly and mysterious Connell (played to perfection by Ryan Reynolds).  The triangle plays out against the other relationships in this tight circle of friends over the summer.  They bicker, they fight, they drink, and they misunderstand.  I'm boiling the plot down a lot here as it does get quite involved and I certainly don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it. As summer comes to a close there's the question of who Emily will stay with: the flawed and possibly unavailable Connell or James, who is leaving for New York City and grad school.  The ending may seem formulaic but it's hardly clichd and will leave you happy and satisfied.

Ads for ""Adventureland"" touted it as coming from the director of ""Superbad"" but that's about where the comparisons end.  There is certainly raunchy humor, vulgarity, and adult humor, but not to the level of ""Superbad.""  The music is period perfect too mixing in 80s groups like Husker Du, the Replacement's and Falco's ""Rock Me Amadeus"" (used to hilarious effect).  There's a certain wistfulness to the movie that borders on nostalgic poignancy for a simpler time that has passed away and in a real sense it's easier to set a movie like this in the recent past rather than our disconnected present.  People working dead end summer jobs of today likely don't connect like this group does.  ""Adventureland"" was sadly overlooked while out in theaters but it is certainly worth a second look.  While not the most memorable film its oddly affecting plot and great cast is certainly enjoyable.",1249948800,,2982,4.878968253968254
3894418,3,B002BFBAWO,"As someone who once worked at an amusement park, I knew I had to see this! But ... sadly, this is definitely a Hollywood version of a teenager, amusement park flick. It's got the not-so-attractive guy -- who would never realistically have a chance with two girls -- getting two girls who look like Kristen Stewart and Margarita Levieva. I don't care how cool this guy is supposed to be, no girls like these two would bat an eye at him. However, that usually doesn't faze me as that seems to be the theme to Judd Apatow-produced comedies nowadays.

I will say that the stand-outs in this film are Martin Starr (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freaks-and-Geeks-The-Complete-Series/dp/B0001EQHXO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freaks and Geeks - The Complete Series</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knocked-Up-Unrated-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000TZJBQ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knocked Up - Unrated (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, ""Superbad""), who is brilliant in just about everything he does; Bill Hader, who can not only pull off his own brand of geeky-type humor but also great hard@$$ scenes (see the baseball bat scene and how effortlessly he transitions); the background characters who bring spice to an otherwise mediocre script, such as Tommy Frigo (Matt Bush), Munch (Barret Hackney), and Lisa P. (Margarita Levieva), because these type of characters are - much like in real life - the ones you remember and laugh about; and the spectacular soundtrack!!! If you are a fan of 1980s alternative such as The Replacements, The Velvet Underground, The New York Dolls, Husker Du, The Cure, Lou Reed and Nick Lowe, and 1980s pop such as INXS, David Bowie, Crowded House, Whitesnake, Judas Priest, and, yes, Falco (""DO THEY HAVE TO KEEP PLAYING THIS SONG!?""), then you'll be racing to find the soundtrack, which sadly is only available as a MP3 download.

Ryan Reynolds and SNL's Kristen Wiig are poorly underused in the film, although Wiig is still hilarious; I have a feeling her hit is gonna be in the Drew Barrymore-directed roller derby dramedy ""Whip It."" This film had a lot of promise but I don't fall for Kristen Stewart's method of acting which is basically always looking uncomfortable. I like Jesse Eisenberg a lot and he did a good job, but I still felt like this wasn't the right film for him.

3894419,5,B002BFBAWO,"WOW! I recently saw this movie on a hotel pay per view deal.
I was blown away. The trailer hinted that it might be a good film but this movie really delivers. it is somewhat like a new take on a John Hughes formula but with more believable less stereotyped and more complex character development. It is an amazing script that captures its time period perfectly.
Having once had the opportunity to have worked in the film industry, a film as great as this makes me sorry that I ever left it and is one of those films that if you are very lucky you have the opportunity to work on.
Greg Mottola's directing and writing is top notch. he does a amazing job with his actors and they all shine.
The cinematography is also amazing as is the edit. It feels like the director has actually caught all of those fleeting moments in life in your early 20's in the late 80's just as they happened and almost has a documentary look to it without being overt or overly stylish.
The edit is also amazing and the whole film comes off as very stylish but none of its artistic elements ever get in the way of the characters or the narrative.
This is the best movie of its type I have ever seen and is a must see.
Finally the soundtrack is epic with the best mix of songs from 80's era music in any film ever.
Greg Mottola is a genius and I would quit my career to work with him as an assistant.",1249084800,,1374,4.169172932330827

3894422,5,B002BFBAWO,"It is 1987, and James Brennan (Eisenberg) is a college graduate looking to get away to Europe for the summer before heading on to graduate school.  Things fall through not only for the summer plans, but for graduate school as well.  James gets a job at Adventureland, making minimum wage and running a game booth.  While there, he meets a wide variety of people, and becomes particularly close to Em (Stewart).  Their relationship is complicated, not the least of which is due to Em's relationship with handyman/rock star Mike Connell (Reynolds).  As the end of summer draws near, they must decide the paths their lives will take, and no option is the easy choice.

""Adventureland"" is a great movie.  Evoking nostalgia for the 1980's, and providing great character development, ""Adventureland"" succeeds in almost every way.  While funny, the movie is not a comedy, but rather the humor of everyday life.  The actors all make their characters real in their own way.  Acting-wise, the one minor quibble is that Eisenberg at times seems like he is channeling his inner Michael Cera.  ""Adventureland"" left me with a warm, fuzzy feeling, and is definitely worth giving a shot.  I highly recommend it.",1241568000,,1195,4.949748743718593

It was much cleaner than i expected, nothing like Superbad- i enjoyed the lack of obtuse profanity...

The story is basic, predictable and unresolved, but the acting is really good and totally identifiable...

overall, I enjoyed it, but would never sit through the whole thing again...

but the use of Kennywood was really great, because, after all, i'm from Pittsburgh and i'm  partial.

3894424,5,B002BFBAWO,"If you're expecting a Judd Apatow comedy or a raunchy teen sex romp with little-to-no sentimentality or meaning behind it, rethink your viewpoint on this film's marketing campaign.

What Adventureland is, in my opinion, is nothing less than maybe the Breakfast Club of today; no other teen film has had such an impact on me as the classic Jon Hughes film has, until I saw Adventureland.

You will definitely laugh, yes; but if you have the brains to do so, you'll have affection and empathy for these characters(not only the two leads; nearly every player here is important) and feel the touching coming-of-age romance between Jesse Eisenberg and Kirsten Stewart(who is millions of miles better here than in Twilight, giving a much more superb performance and playing a much more interesting character than bella swan ever was).

What am I doing? Trying to give this a calm and professional review? Let me just come out and say it: I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!!! I can't think of a teen film this decade that can compare with this one. I saw it a second time 2 days after opening night, because I knew it deserved a second viewing, and I'm excited for my third, because I cannot stop thinking about this movie. It made me happy at the right times, sad at the right times, and as for Greg Mottola, this is a great improvement over Superbad(which I actually find to be very overrated). I thought that was okay, but this is a much more personal, and real project for him.

This is one of the best teen movies I've ever seen and without a doubt my favorite film of 2009 so far (yes it beats out Watchmen, much to my own surprise). I went in expecting to have the kind of good time that most Apatow-esque comedies give me(like the recent ""I Love You, Man""), but I got much more than that.

(oh, and if you're into the kind of 80's music I am, you will love the references to Lou Reed, David Bowie, The Replacements, and Husker Du)

3894425,4,B002BFBAWO,"""Adventureland"", the new film from writer-director Greg Mottola (""Superbad"") is a pretty good film. A coming of age story set in the late 80s, Mottola weaves a realistic story about recent college grads who are trying to earn some money and have some fun over the summer. The film is surprisingly intimate, and reflective and I would have to guess it is based on Mottola's own experiences. But it isn't that funny and proves to be another example of a bad marketing campaign promising one thing when the film is made to deliver something else. This may eke out a few dollars for the studio, but it will probably back fire and cause the film to lose more prospective viewers than it might gain.

James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg, ""Noah and the Whale"") graduates from college and tries to eke out a couple of hundred additional dollars from his parents; they have already promised to pay for a graduation trip to Europe, before he goes to grad school, and he and his friend want to extend the trip a little, so he needs more money. But his parents (Wendy Malick, Jack Gilpin) have some bad news; Dad is being transferred and will make less money. They can't afford to send James to Europe and grad school is doubtful as well. James tries to find a job, any job, but can only get hired at Adventureland, a run down theme park run by Bobby (Bill Hader) and Paulette (Kristen Wiig, both of TV's ""Saturday Night Live""). James is thrust into a job running Games, despite his desire to join the more interesting and cooler group of kids running the Rides. On his first day, he meets Em (Kristen Stewart, ""Twilight"") and he seems surprised that she is actually responding to his goofy flirtations and sensibility. And Mike Connell (Ryan Reynolds), the head of maintenance, walks through the park with the approving eye of the girls and the awe of the boys.

Jesse Eisenberg is near perfect as James, the nervous kid who is getting closer to being on his own, making his own way through the world. He is still a kid, despite graduating from college, and is disappointed and shocked to learn he won't be able to join his best friend on their planned European tour. He is a smart kid, the type of kid who uses these smarts at inopportune times, inadvertently making others look stupid, which gets him into some trouble. He is also unsure of himself and seems to be shocked every time a girl even gives him the time of day. When he and Em start to hang out together, he is delighted but also more nervous because she really seems to like him.

Eisenberg has primarily played high school kids, so it is nice to see him playing a college graduate, however immature. It works to his favor that I kept thinking he was in high school, because James is not very mature despite his education. When Em invites him to a party, she coyly asks him if he wants to go swimming. She proceeds to strip and jumps in the pool. He is game and strips down to his underwear before jumping in. After a few minutes, she wants to get out and dry off. He has to wait a few minutes, before getting out of the pool. It is a nice, touching, very human moment.

Kristen Stewart is also very good as the unpredictable Em. Already very confused, she meets James and they become friends, flirting consistently. She really likes him and they go out on a date or two. But she has other influences in her life, influences that are hard to kick or hard to correct. Throughout, you can see little glimmers of hope in her eyes. Maybe my life can become less dramatic, less plagued by trouble. But one of these influences is very familiar, and easy, despite the consequences, so she keeps finding her way back to this.

And because these kids are young, and aren't paying rent or mortgages, if anything gets too heavy, they simply face the problem by announcing ""I quit"" and run off to be by themselves. When the problems follow them home, they realize the solution isn't that simple.

Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig provide some whacked out laughs as the couple who are ""in charge"" of the theme park. Bobby immediately runs to the rescue of any of his employees, fending off bullies with a baseball bat and a psycho attitude. Paulette stands on the sidelines, admiring Bobby when he is called into action to run one of the games, remembering back to why she fell in love with him in the first place. Despite their relative young age, you get the feeling they have been in this business for a long time and they have the answers to every situation.

Ryan Reynolds plays Mike, an older guy who performs maintenance throughout the park. As he struts through the grounds, everyone seems to regard him in awe. His age and his status as a struggling musician make him cool to both the boys and girls. The guys want to be him; the girls want to be with him.

There are a number of other memorable kids who work at the park and intersect with James and Em.

But ""Adventureland"" is not a comedy, not really. There are some funny moments, but these are more observational moments. And they are few and far between. It seems misleading to advertise the film as a comedy, but this genre is easier to sell and will probably generate more ticket sales. But as word spreads, how will people deal with the fact that the film is a drama? A good drama? It seems like this practice would alienate people. People looking for a comedy will probably be disappointed. People, who want to see a good drama, won't realize they have a potential film under their nose. It just seems like a lose-lose situation. Why Miramax? Why?

""Adventureland"" may seem a bit like a retread, but it is actually fairly unique. Most coming of age stories deal with high schoolers, kids either in high school, soon to graduate or graduating. This film depicts kids who are a little older, college graduates, but they still don't have everything figured out. As we watch them deal with the problems they experience, we identify with them. Most of us didn't have everything figured out when we graduated college (and many still don't) so the story of these kids speaks to us in a way.

Written and directed by Greg Mottola, the film is based on his own experiences in the same situation. I am sure much of what happens to James probably happened to him, in some form. And because so much of the story comes from a personal place, all of the characters seem more real, more interesting. From the nervous energy surrounding James, to the laid back attitude we see in Em, to the cool vibe coming from Mike, we have seen these types of characters before, but Mottola gives each a new level of detail, bringing them more sharply into focus.

""Adventureland"" is a good, interesting coming of age film. Check it out.",1239753600,,6707,4.515650741350906
3894426,5,B002BFBAWO,"James (Jesse Eisenberg) is a smart, sensitive kid just out of college. He needs to save money for grad school and finds himself working at a tawdry amusement park called Adventureland. His job is mindless and boring. But he soon ends up falling for his rebellious and angsty co-worker Em  (Kristen Stewart). Em is still in mourning over the loss of her mother to cancer, a situation made worse by her selfish and superficial step-mother. James and Em begin to develop a close bond. But Em is unwilling to committ and James is afraid of rejection. So they struggle to find their way while dealing with the trials and tribulations of youth.

I've got to say I love, love, love this movie. I also grew up in the 80's and can relate on a very profound level to the awkward and confusing situations James has to deal with. I liked writer/director James Mottola's earlier work, ""Superbad"". But this is a very different and perhaps even better movie. It has a sweeter, more heartfelt tone, with humor that is more subtle but still had me laughing out loud. The acting by Jesse Eisneberg and Kristen Stewart is top notch. It also has a great soundtrack featuring bands like Husker Du and the Replacements. It has an eye for detail and nuance in it's portrait of coming of age in the 80's. But also has a timeless quality that people of all generations should be able to appreciate. This is my favorite film of 2009 so far. Don't miss it!",1239667200,2,1429,4.534883720930233
3894427,2,B002BFBAWO,"Will appeal more to adolescents and young adults than to viewers above age 40. The storyline was okay, but the acting itself was vapid and insipid with a stammering and halting speaking style that many critics adored but which I found annoying and distracting.",1239408000,5,260,4.931818181818182
3894428,5,B002BFBAWO,"I got to see this film at a sneak preview.  I got free tickets at an 80's club I frequent.  I only had a mild interest in seeing this film when I saw the trailers.  In other words, this one was going to be one to wait for on dvd.  Free is free, and I went with a tribe of folks on a Wednesday night.

To my surprise, this was a really sweet, funny, well-acted, and truly great film.  Yes, this is a film, not some flash-in-the-pan, cash in on the youth market, gross out comedy.  Sure, it has elements of that too, but they're more subdued and the humor is less broad and more sublte.  It's basically about characters you already know or have met in your life.  It takes place in the 80's and it's basica plot involves the horror any 20-something would face during a recession, getting a really crappy summer job!

The real revelation I found with this film came in the form of Kristen Stewart.  She's the real deal.  I had seen her in Twilight recently and found everything anyone did in that film to be hollow.  Here, she really shows her acting chops playing a confused youth afraid of the unknown.  Jesse Eisenberg is the main character in the film, and I expected nothing but greatness from him, I previously saw him in the brilliant The Squid and the Whale.  He is a very talented young actor who I expect to see a lot more from in the future.

The film has all the details of a youth summer job that sucks pegged.  Everything from the one hot-chick that everyone wants, the low-rent customers, the over-zealous and possibly dellusional bosses, and on-job romance.  It's all done with genuine emotion and situations.  Nothing feels contrived or forced.  Characters make mistaks and things go wrong, but there are no moments of the characters becoming overwrought and giving prefunctory speeches regarding the film's main themes.  This is really well written.

I must warn all the video game obsessed, vapid, youth drones about what they're getting with this film.  It has real characters, and a believable situation.  It's a hang-out picture.  You just spend time getting to know a particular group of characters who share the same crappy theme park summer job.  There is no contrived plot devices, like switched or confused identities, no one is masquarading as one of the opposite sex, no plot devices to keep a false narrative going, and no gags just stuck in the film like an overlong action sequence to get yucks.  Yes, the kids get wasted and high, but it has more to do with them coping with their boredom, and it also helps lead to their bonding.

The film manages to be honestly touching as well, something I really didn't expect from this piece.  It was made by the same director of Super Bad, a really brilliant and funny youth comedy, but it is nothing like it.  It's not as great, but its not going for the same thing.  The humor comes from character and honest situations and not from over-blown comic situations just set up for the yucks.

If this film would've been advertised differently, I would've paid to see it.",1239321600,86,3038,4.547970479704797
3894429,2,B002BFBAWO,"Growing up in the 1980's I thought this may be a fun flick to see as it was listed under 'comedy'.
The characters are surface deep and the acting was terrible.  Stewart has limited facial expressions so you need to try to guess what she's feeling.
Touches on drug use, drinking, extra-marital sex and drunk driving - but with no 'lessons learned'.
Don't waste your time or money, it wasn't funny - it was pathetic.",1239235200,2,414,4.52

It's not a pretty place, but for the two lost souls tossed about in this storm, there is a ray of hope...  It left me shaking, emotionally, in a way that movies rarely do.  The moments of tenderness and comedy diffused the tension.  I loved it.",1238976000,2,332,4.576271186440678
8361174,5,B002BFBAWO,The esthetic and dialogue of this movie as per Greg Mottola are brilliantly arranged. This is one of those films I can watch over and over and still pick up neat nuances. Jesse and Kristen are brilliant and a perfect dynamic supportive role by Martin Starr. Just a real and nostalgic time capsule of film. Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig are also perfectly placed with great dialogue as well. This is a brilliant movie that takes you back to the 80's.,1521676800,,447,4.530864197530864
