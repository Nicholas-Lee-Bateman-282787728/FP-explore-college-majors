8630248,5,B00H5NY6DM,"Although ""Dynasty"" was no longer a Top 10 rated series on American television by the fall of 1987 loyal viewers kept up with the goings-on of the Carringtons. The series, which started an hour earlier, began with an exciting beginning with Matthew Blaisedale holding members of the Carrington's captive. The outcome was very dramatic with a character dying. Also noticeable was the loss of Dominique Devereaux afetr Diahann Carroll was dropped from the series. However, Jeff and Fallon make their return back from the ill-fated and cancelled ""Colbys"", played by John James and Emma Samms.
