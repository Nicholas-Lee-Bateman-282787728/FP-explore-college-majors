1023142,3,6305419841,"I think over all this movie was not that bad.  It was more or less alot like the novel written by Lois Duncan ""Gallows Hill""  I really enjoyed watching this movie on T.V and I like it so much I bought it again  on video.  Watch for yourself and then decide if it is good or bad.",957657600,3,278,3.824561403508772
1023143,3,6305419841,"To be honest, this movie wasn't that good nor was it that bad either. Being the Lois Duncan fan that I am (she wrote the original book which is *nothing* like this movie), I wanted to like this movie.
Before I go on,  here is a little summary:
The movie is about a girl named Sarah that  moves into a small town with her single mother named Rosemary. To the local  high schoolers she's weird: she's from California, she wears  ""weird"" clothes, and she has witty and aloof air to her. Of  course, that makes her an out cast...and it doesn't help that she lives in  a house that has a freaky history.
To make a long story short, trouble  starts when some person stalk and terrorize a certain group of people--and  group think it's Sarah. They have their reasons...but I won't get into that  (don't want to spoil the movie).
Now, the movie does have an interesting  plot, I give it that, but if you are a person that craves the gore, the  slash, the horror...you won't get it here. The body count is nill and the  only thing the villian does is scare the heck out of people. After all,  this was made for TV, so the budget is not very high.
Now...for the  villain. It was obvious that the NBS producers tried to cash in on the hype  of scream. The villain costume looks very similar to the Scream one. You  think they would be a little more creative.
The ending is sort of  spenseful, but confusing. I saw the movie twice. The first time I didn't  get it and the second time I only half got it. You will probably have to  rewind it one or two times to get everything...a lot of revelations happens  at the end.
The plot ""twist"" was surprising, but kind of  corney.
So if you are in for some mindless horror, this movie is for  you.",956620800,5,1728,4.252307692307692
1023144,4,6305419841,I saw this movie in the Uk. The movie did not have enough depth in the story lines and it should have being a longer movie. The movie looked like the movie Scream. The best actresses was Sarah Chalke man she is a babe.  She really was mystic in the movie. I think Sarah should act in a better  and longer movie. May be do a movie in the UK.,955670400,,340,3.842857142857143
1023145,1,6305419841,"Many horror movies have come out as late, especially dealing with teens.  This one looked kinda bizzarre, so I though I would check it out with my buddy GUS.  We didn't know that this was a TV movie, or we would have never  picked it up.  Punky Brewster looked pretty hot, so we thought we'd just  check it.  Man, was this bad, they've constructed a horrible script, and  the acting is pretty bad too.  There is nothing to scare you in this movie,  the myth is so muddled, and the scary parts take part in broad daylight. If  that isn't a cue for disaster I don't know what is!  The plot is never  clearly given and it weighs between a curse and a ugly pinnochio like  GOBLin with sharp tinsel foil on his hand running around scaring everybody!  Very formulaic in it's approach to teens and highschool, you know why this  one is a lemon. Even the ending is so confusing, the killer returns ? Is  this the end ? Very bizarre.  The only thing I can say to make you see this  is that if you're a die hard fan of these teens slashers of late, and you  want to see each one, then I guess this one would be on your list.

1023280,2,6305419841,"This is probably one of the worst horror flicks I have ever seen. I first saw it when I was really young and thought it was pretty scary so when i saw it in the video store other day I thought I'd see how well it held up. Well it didn't at all. When I was little the mask seemed so scary now it just seems stupid. There are a lot of things that work against this movie. First of all is the killer, if you could even call it that. The ""killer"" doesn't really kill anyone. It seems as if he/she about to kill one girl but before he/she has a chance she dies from fright which is lame. The killer has these long sharp claws that he/she made but everytime he/she swings at someone with them he/she misses them then when he/she has the perfect chance to use them to kill someone he/she doesn't do it! Second of all is the predictability of it all. When the killer first appears there's no doubt to who it is. Third is the plot. The plot is just lame. The whole someone has come back to take revenge for past wrongs has been done many times over. Fourth is the characters. How many older teens do you know throw freakin costume parties without any drinking involved? I'm not saying I condone teen drinking but please make it more realistic. Fifth is some of the horrible dialogue. Example: The killer has got a girl around the neck. The girl says, ""Please don't kill me!"" then the killer says, ""Something much worse."" then cuts her face a little bit with his/her claws as the girl screams ""Not my face!"" Please thats just stupid. Sixth and lastly the ending. The ending sucked. I felt that it cheated me but considering the rest of the movie I wasn't suprised. The explanation for the whole thing is so convoluted that it's ridiculous. Also the big showdown scene lacks suspense. For all my complaining I did see potential for an excellent movie. If had changed a few elements it could've been an excellent entry into the teen slasher genre instead of a wannabe Scream.

PLOT:

A teen from California named Sarah Zultan(Sarah Chalke) moves to Massachusettes with her mom. She has an interest in the occult and a smart mouth. The members of the Descendents Club(Kyra, Eric, Debbie, Kevin, and Misty) all begin to believe she is a reincarnation of a witch who swore revenge on their 5 ancestors 300 years earlier. There are a few suprises thrown when the weird loser of the school Charlie(Ben Foster)reveals to Sarah that he's also a member of the Descendents Club but the others believe there are only five descendents.

CAST:

I'm not going through the whole cast in this review because no one in the cast did an outstanding job in their roles and most of them will probably not be landing anymore acting gigs outside of crap like this. The three most well known are probably Sarah Chalke from the Roseanne, Soleil Moon Frye from Punky Brewster and Ben Foster who actually has been getting a few roles in Hollywood these days.

FINAL WORD:

This is a below average entry in the teen slasher genre. I doubt it will scare anyone over 12.",1128211200,3,3029,4.448648648648649

""I've been waiting for you"" is one of those movies that could have been something much more. This was originally a Tv-movie for lifetime and then, in later years, was released on DVD. The cover of the film markets the film as a teen slasher flick, which is what it should have been. I think the producers of the movie forgot that in order for a movie to be a slasher movie, the killer has to actually kill people, which is where the film failed. Even if they wanted to keep the movie ""Tv-friendly"" or ""PG-13"" they still could have killed off the cast. That's what should have happened to move the plot along. The first half of this movie was pretty good. It was entertaining, but then the movie shifts gear, in order to prepare for it finale. Which is fine, but the killer just basically chased people around for the rest of the movie. I mean, by the end of the movie, I kinda felt cheated. But anyway, it's actually quite clever and the plot is interesting. If this film had the violence and gore it needed, it could have definetly been a standout slasher flick.

1023282,3,6305419841,"The identity of the ""masked madman"" is pretty obvious once the character is introduced, and even though they try and throw some red herrings at you, ""I've Been Waiting for You"", a middling TV movie, offers nothing new.  Sarah Chalke does a good job in the lead role of Sarah, the young girl who moves to Pinecrest, Massachusetts, where three hundred years earlier, a witch named Sarah Lancaster was toasted at the stake and gosh darn put a curse on the descendants of the people who burned her!
We are of course treated to the snooty five descendants of such people who are convinced the new Sarah is the witch Sarah come back for revenge.
Interestingly enough, the masked man only kills one person and that's only because she was stupid enough to die of fright.  The others he just sort of scares.  Ho hum.  While a modicum of suspense is maintained, the overall effect is generic tv movie syndrome.  Poor Markie Post looks like she filmed this movie on two hours sleep.  The rest of the cast is appropriately dysfunctional and the ending is rather ludicrous.

1023284,2,6305419841,"As far as T.V. movies dealing with horror go, this one is better than most. It's based on the Lois Duncan book ""Gallows Hill"". A mom and daughter move to a quaint,small New England town and into a creepy old house. Not creepy!. It turns out this house was where a supposed witch lived hundreds of years before. She was captured and killed. All of a sudden, strange things begin to happen. I wasn't expecting that!. Okay, I'm done with the sarcasm. A mysterious figure with an old hag/witch face and steel claws in a robe begins stalking a batch of young teens. Many believe it's the ghost of this witch, who has come back to get the decendants of the people who killed her all those years ago. The witch character is pretty flimsy, but there are moments that are better than what you'd expect from a ... T.V. movie jumping on the horror bandwagon. There are a number of familiar faces in this movie. Sarah Chalke from ""Roseanne"" and ""Scrubs"", Markie Post from ""Night Court"", Soilei Moon Frye from ""Punky Brewster"" and ""Sabrina"", and Neve Campbell's look a like brother Christian Campbell. The film was competently made, but just a tad bit boring. Not a lot happens. Being a T.V. movie, there isn't much blood or violence. The stuff that is there is pretty tame. The story is all right, but it's not Shakespeare. All in all, it's typical fare, but above most horror T.V. movies. I'm sure not everybody has been waiting for this one.",1010707200,6,1431,4.550387596899225

7889013,4,6305419841,I saw this movie on Lifetime some time ago and enjoyed it.  I found it for sale for a fairly reasonable price and watched it again and I still found it enjoyable.

I also liked how the sins of the forefathers had an effect on just about the whole town.  It was interesting to see how the main characters were tied together.,1296691200,,463,4.204545454545454

7889015,4,6305419841,"First, I have to admit. I'm a sucker for ""Monday Night Movies"". I've watched many of them starring some of the top tv stars of their time.

I actually didn't catch I've Been Waiting For You on it's original run, but caught it much later. The film caught me from the beginning, as the story was intriguing.

The film opens with the narration of a legend about a witch who was killed by members of her own town. We are then brought into the present in the same town, witnessing a single Mom and her daughter (played by Markie Post of Night Court, and Sarah Chalke from Roseanne and Scrubs) moving into a new house. The young lady, Sarah Zoltanne, is into the New Age and is quickly drawn to the history of her home and the town with the help of her new friend, but school outcast, Charlie.

Sarah is immediately labeled as a witch at her school due to the strange things she is able to do (which leaves the audience wondering...is she really a witch?), and the school popular gang is determined to run her out of town. The film continues on a wild ride of twists and turns, complete with a masked man in a cloak reminiscent of Scream.

For a made-for-tv movie, this is really enjoyable. There is not any gore,  which does not deter from the plot of the film. You can also enjoy Sarah Chalke lip-syncing and dancing to the great song ""The World Outside"" by The Devlins. For a fun night in with the girls, or even for a date, pop this movie in and have some fun. The film will keep you wondering until the end, and not until the very end do you truly find out who the real Sarah is......",1202169600,3,1583,4.245847176079734
