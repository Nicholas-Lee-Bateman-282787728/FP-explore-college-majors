3525262,5,B001D40U5M,Top Gear is a great show and this special one of their best. The comic timing and interplay of the hosts make Top Gear fun for car nuts and those who just enjoy British humor. Think of it as Mythbuster with a little Monty Phython mixed in.,1319500800,,239,4.1063829787234045
3525263,4,B001D40U5M,"This standalone special was aired a couple years back but it was the first Top Gear programme ever aired on BBC HD. Fans who watched the televised broadcast version finally got to see the boys on a life & death adventure up in the Arctic trying to get to the North Pole in a couple of heavily modified Toyota Hilux pickups with many laughs, and breathtaking scenes along the way.

Finally this was released on home video as the first bluray release for TG ever and it is definitely worth adding to the collection for fans.  Changes from the broadcast version include both good & bad.

First the bad, due to BBC's music license agreement, much of the great music used for broadcast cannot be used on home video versions so they have to replace much of the soundtrack.

Now onto the good:
1. gorgeous 1080p HD video, very sharp and crisp as this special was filmed in full HD
2. There is actually more content in this home version with about 8 min of additional scenes and footage added back in the ep.
3. is region free and has no problems playing on american bluray players such as the PS3, despite not being an official US market release.
4. The Polar special itself is quite cool and fun to watch.

This is a must get for most fans of Top Gear and it must be seen in HD.",1307577600,11,1272,4.305439330543933
3525264,5,B001D40U5M,"This is an older episode, but a classic. I think it was far better than the Vietnam show, but not quite as interesting as the Botswana special. A must have for any and all fans of Hammond, May, and Clarkson.",1264636800,9,207,4.2

3525300,5,B001D40U5M,Works well on my laptop. Couldn't play it on my dvd player because it is the uk version. I knew it and still bought it because I love the show so much.,1448323200,,151,3.75
3525301,5,B001D40U5M,"This DVD really is Blu-Ray. Crystal clear picture, a few extra bits included & region free. It is a joy to watch. I would also say the firm who sold it are very good too: It arrived before Amazon claimed it had shipped. I shall buy more from them, with no doubt. Of course, more of that edition of Top Gear would nice too.",1444176000,3,322,4.046875

And if you are a fan of the show, please please please, do yourself a solid and pick this up because the extra footage (about 10 minutes) and the high definition picture are absolutely worth it. I first saw this episode 3 years ago and this was like watching a brand new special. I cannot recommend this highly enough.",1408492800,,447,4.270588235294118
3525304,5,B001D40U5M,"I had to buy this separately to complete my set of Top Gear episodes and I don't regret it.  This adventure was one of their most daring and interesting and I really enjoyed watching it in the full version that had so much more than what was shown in the 1 hour spot on BBC America.

If you like Top Gear you have to see this.",1387411200,4,326,3.9242424242424243
3525305,5,B001D40U5M,The item was shipped immediately and before they said it would arrive. It was great to give this gift on time rather than have it been given after Christmas (As I would have expected it),1358467200,,186,4.3428571428571425
3525306,4,B001D40U5M,"I own Top Gear Season 14 on Blu-Ray and this special is included in its entirety as a special feature. I'm not sure how much the ""Director's Cut"" adds to the special, but the whole version that was  aired on BBC America is definitely included. This is just a heads up to those of you who want the special without wanting to shell out the extra $$$.",1327190400,11,348,4.1940298507462686

If there is anyone out there that can give me a code to unlock the Sony BDP S5500

Other than this...Looks like this seller is making money selling discs that don't work.
Despite the warning... Those comments that say YES their blue ray can read these discs THOSE COMMENTS SHOULD BE RE,OVED.",1527292800,,377,4.696969696969697

8291592,1,B001D40U5M,Discs were not even formatted to play. I tried 3 different blue ray players. Then only got half my money back because I opened them. But I wouldn't have known they didn't work if I didn't open them. Very disappointed! My blue ray players warned they could be pirated because they weren't formatted to play. That company is making lots of money off everyone - not amazon.,1501200000,,370,4.537313432835821

8291596,5,B001D40U5M,The company quickly reordered the item when I informed them that I had not received it on the due date; they even expressed concern that I owned a DVD player that would play the Non-USA format. As a longtime fan of the original TOP GEAR (I have never watched the Matt LeBlanc unfortunate reboot) I was delighted to see this box set available at an affordable price.,1475971200,,365,4.462686567164179
