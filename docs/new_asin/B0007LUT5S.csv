8324423,5,B0007LUT5S,Another MUST for a Porsche junkie...  Some extremely interesting footage of old 356's and 550's racing and a great history of how the turbo cars dominated racing throughout the 70s and 80s.  I watched it 3x's in 3 days!!,1219276800,,220,4.615384615384615
8324424,4,B0007LUT5S,"I love to sit on the computer with this dvd playing in DTS mode in the background.  Would like to see it in 1080p and 7.1 with more time alloted to in-depth viewing of each model.  A full 2 hours would be awesome.  Still, this has got to be the best way to hear these beautiful machines running if you don't actually own one.",1211068800,,325,4.046875
