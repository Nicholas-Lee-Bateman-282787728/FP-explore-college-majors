Ever since the batman TV Show it seems that bad writing or wooden acting is pawned off as ""high camp' rather than the tripe that is is. Not so here. We are only missing a half sloshed Lon Channey JR to complete this cast.
  This flick is a popcorn burning, late night monster bash Roger Corman or Sid Pink would be proud of! !!!!! To all involved I say, Don't stop now! Keep 'em coming!!! You make 'em, I'll buy 'em!!!",1473552000,5,563,4.509803921568627
7731740,1,B01E771PY6,"This is a DVD-R not a DVD. There is a difference, the info on Amazon needs to be corrected immediately. Poor quality and pixilation, compression issues. Ruined the movie for me.",1472342400,2,177,4.741935483870968
7731741,4,B01E771PY6,"If you took ""Land of the Lost"" and combined it with ""The Amazing Colossal Man"" you'd get something like ""Triclops"", Brett Piper's heartfelt homage to 1950s and 1960s sci-fi movies. I love those wacky old movies where radiation turns things into crazier, bigger, or deadlier things, and so does Piper, and here his love shows through. The film opens with an Air Force pilot ejecting from his F-18 over mysterious Amarok crater. The pilot's bold fiance Samantha (Erin Waterhouse) and loathsome and cowardly brother, Sasquatch expert and tabloid journalist Tom (Matthew Crawley), hire a drunken pilot played to perfection by Ken Van Sant, to take them there in his Cessna 172.

Because his plane has been repossessed and general mob types are after him (watch for the trash can beating), they have to leave at night. They get to the crater and are forced down by a collision with a flock of flying capybaras. As the foursome (they have been joined by a mob enforcer) venture out they find amazing creatures everywhere (""It looked like something from the dinosaur family!"") Between the grabby carnivorous plants, the giant ant colony, an epic termite battle, a huge flea, and the giant scorpion, there's plenty of action to go around, mostly involving Samantha, who is imprisoned by ants and pinched by a scorpion among other indignities. Tom wants to abandon her (""She's monster chow!"") but the two heroes resist the temptation to bail out and of course for their effort all four get imprisoned by a giant Triclops. Is the Triclops Samantha's fianc? I won't reveal the answer, but Piper plays out the answer to that question more skillfully than you'd expect for a film of this budget. I particularly liked when the Triclops picked up Samantha in his hand in a nod to ""King Kong"".

The plot gets into imprisonment, radiation induced mutations, Molotov cocktails, and death in a boiling pool of lava among other elements typical of such films. Three of the four (no guessing who doesn't make it, though I bet you could) make it out of the crater through a backdoor crevasse, and the film ends much like its progenitors from fifty years ago.

The DVD includes outtakes and bloopers, which are short and modestly amusing, and commentary with Brett Piper and some of the cast and one of the Polonia brothers. Yes, this is a Polonia production, but do not be alarmed, as it's also the best one I've ever seen. I really enjoyed this film: if you love monster movies from years past, this is a loving homage to and part-time spoof of those movies. Have a good time!",1472342400,5,2555,4.776018099547511

7731744,5,B01E771PY6,"If you're looking for a throwback to the good old days when films were entertaining, this is the film for you.  Brett Piper is the heir apparent to stop motion master Ray Harryhausen and his films are just pure popcorn-munching fun.  Highly recommended.",1470182400,,253,4.8604651162790695
7731745,5,B01E771PY6,"I've been a really big Brett Piper fan for a long time.  Ever since I watched Drainiac, I've been hooked.  Triclops really takes the fun b-movie aspect and runs away with it.  I had a ton of fun watching this film.  The characters are funny, especially the washed up drunk pilot.  The cheap, yet effective and creative effects are a blast.  Whether you're impressed with the effects or not, there a ton of visual things that are very arresting.  Dig it, dig it, dig it.",1468368000,4,469,4.447058823529412
7731746,5,B01E771PY6,We all loved it! The kids (7 and 9) got a kick out of it and wanted to re-watch it the next day. Now they want to watch The Swamp Thing and other in the genre which is great because we are trying to give them their fill of old classics. Note of bias - Erin is my sister. :-),1467331200,2,274,3.5833333333333335
7731747,3,B01E771PY6,"Highly enjoyable 50s throwback adventure with terrific, Old School make-up and stop-motion animation special effects; it's a shame that the disc itself is so poor. Picture quality on this DVD-R is astoundingly low resolution, even sub-VHS in spots, and riddled with compression artifacts/pixelization. Additionally, Alpha Video hasn't quite grasped the concept of 16x9 televisions, and instead presents this ""widescreen"" feature in a non-anamorphic, matted 4x3 aspect ratio. I haven't seen a DVD formatted like this in 15 years. The low price takes a bit of the sting out of it, but what a disappointment.",1465171200,15,605,5.446808510638298
