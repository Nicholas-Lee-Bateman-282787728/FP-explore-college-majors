8703808,4,B00U1E1SJC,"Set in the rubbish tips of Rio, two friends - Raphael and Gardo- discover a wallet that has ended up in the trash. They know it is a windfall but then the cops turn up offering a large reward and Raphael thinks there is more to this than meets the eye. So they enlist the help of a diseased sewer kid called Rato and go off to discover its secrets.

There is a lot packed into this extremely well made film. Martin Sheen appears as a Priest who is helping the poor and Rooney Mara brings some glamour amidst the rubbish of the slum. There is violence here too and some scenes that should not be in a film that describes itself as a comedy. But that said this has a bit of everything. The young boys carry the story and are all excellent - the cinematography is rather special too especially making the flotsam and detritus floating on a polluted river seem almost beautiful. It is a bit overly sentimental but no where near as much as say `Slumdog Millionaire', and it is totally forgivable once taken in context.

I did though really enjoy this film, it is in Portuguese with a fair amount of English and it runs to 114 minutes - all of which is put to great use. I also saw someone in the credits called `Wellington Pingo' which is the best name ever - probably. This is for those who like a bit of grit, dirt, strong storyline and a rollicking ride - completely recommended.",1437696000,,1377,4.292307692307692
8703809,4,B00U1E1SJC,"Based on an Andy Mulligan novel of the same title (2010), Trash is an adventure thriller about three Rio de Janeiro street kids Raphael (Rickson Teves), Gardo (Eduardo Luis) and Rato (Gabriel Weinstein). One day, while picking waste, the fourteen-year-old boy Raphael finds a wallet with money and a few other things  a wallet that the local police, led by a mean police detective (Selton Mello), are looking for desperately.

Directed by Stephen Daldry (Billy Elliot The Hours) and written by Richard Curtis (Love Actually About Time), the film looks like a blend of treasure-hunting adventure story and reality-based crime thriller. The three boys set out to do the right thing, while solving the mysteries of the wallet. Some may compare this to the flashback part of Slumdog Millionaire, but Trash is lighter in its tone, heavier on adventure than on realism.

Martin Sheen appears as Father Juilliard, and Rooney Mara as Sister Olivia, both characters working for the children. Theirs are supporting roles, and, though their performances are very good, their roles are rather small and unmemorable.

Perhaps Trash needs a better conclusion, and its realistic visuals are considerably undermined by some implausible turns of events, but all in all it is a well-made and entertaining adventure movie.",1425772800,,1303,5.220095693779904
