1414148,3,B00005AMQR,"Since sci fi channel is not running 1st & 2nd seasons eps, this is the only way I have to see them. I do enjoy the alt commentaries on each ep which other TV/DVD's don't have and I adore the extra few minutes that we in the US are robbed of. all the other 'extra's on the dvd are pointless. I do agree that a boxed set of 1st season would have been a better buy. When it does come I am gonna be annoyed that I couldn't wait and had to buy these. For 2 eps the price should have been lower.",991958400,6,489,3.7572815533980584
1414149,2,B00005AMQR,"Henson & Co. is has taken lessons in greed and arrogance from Paramount/Viacom and only offering 2 episodes per DVD.  What a rip!!  They should take lessons instead from HBO and Fox and offer entire seasons (like Sex In The City, Sopranos and X-Files) in a single package.  Overall it's cheaper and more appealing to the consumer, which is why those packages are always near the top in Amazon's Top Seller's list instead of Trek/Farscape.",991872000,11,438,4.8133333333333335
1414150,3,B00005AMQR,"I bought a few of these after hearing great stuff about the show and I loved the episodes but I won't buy anymore because like the above reviews, only two episodes is not enough for me to pay a DVD every month or so. I want the season box sets and won't buy anymore until they come out with those. Great show though. Very imaginative, good stories and conflict.  Recent Star Trek shows should get a clue and watch some of these.",991872000,6,428,4.219512195121951
1414151,1,B00005AMQR,"Having to pay for $20 per 2 TV Episodes is what I call disgrace! DVD was invented for better not for worse! Act accordingly and don't buy these DVD's unless they become available in a much more reasonable price. Please note that I have not seen any episode of Farscape and although i was planning to buy the Series on DVD to try it out, I won't cause I don't like being fooled! Same thing they do and on Star Trek TOS. You 've got to buy 40 DVD's priced 15-17$ each! This will not stand!",991872000,10,487,4.083333333333333
1414152,5,B00005AMQR,"I think the system of DVD's is fine the way it is. While it is sometimes more expensive to buy the whole season at two shows per DVD, these DVD's have more features on them than the other shows with their whole season on one DVD. The Farscape DVD's have more features that are great to watch, escpecially the commentaries that give the viewer a background view of what's going on in the show. These extra features would not always be available if the whole season were on one disc, and they are what make these DVD's worth every penny! Farscape is the best no matter how you package it!",991612800,2,586,4.336363636363636
1414153,5,B00005AMQR,"this system is so much better than bundled sets! if you really like Farscape, this is a dream come true. each and every single episode gets an alternate audio track featuring the actors and/or producers. by putting only two episodes per disc, you get nice extras, unlike the x-files and stargate sets. And it's not really that much more expensive. If you pre-order, you can get each for about 20 bucks, which comes out to $220 per season. compare that to $150 for each x-files season. it's not much more when you consider the value of the commentary tracks alone. plus it looks cool to have farscape dominate your dvd collection, in my opinion.",991008000,6,644,4.657894736842105
1414154,2,B00005AMQR,Lets be realistic.  Why is that all other shows are going the route of a one price/ whole season dvd system?  It's fair to the consumer and a cash cow for the producers and retailers.  However why does farscape decide to grab their loyal viewers by the ankles and shake them until all their money falls out of their pockets?  It just doesn't make sense.  They won't get anymore of my money until they change their system.  Do the same and hopefully we will all get rewarded with a clean and easy purchasing system and a fair price.  The shows are great but at this price and this system they are worth the wait.,990576000,24,611,4.307017543859649
1414155,3,B00005AMQR,"it doesn't make sense to sell 2 episodes per disc. episodes should be bundled. however, it's unlikely that adv films will wake up...so don't look for a box set any time soon.",990403200,5,174,4.46875
1414156,3,B00005AMQR,"Any Fan of a series wants all the episodes of that series. The problem comes when these marketing types decide that you will pay [price] per tape in order to get it.
 The X-Files Season one, two and three are prime examples of what fans are willing to pay.
 The latest addition to the Supranos and sex in the city series is Stargate SG-1! Here is the whole season in one package for one low price! Trust me! You already pay your cable companies money to have these channels why do you want to pay them more for the privalidge of only get two episodes per disk?
 I'm a fan of Farscape, I love the charaters but, I'm going to wait until they offer this in the complete set. Trust me they will come. If not then I'll wait and get it used and reasonable!

1414157,4,B00005AMQR,"Please note this really isn't a review, since I haven't seen the two episodes included in the DVD, and not the DVD itself.  At the time I'm writing this, Amazon.com have not put any of the features that will come with this DVD.  The information listed in the following is taken directly from the ADV Films website and should be fairly accurate, hopefully this will help you to determine whether to pre-order a copy for yourself or not.  Unfortunately starting DVD#4 there will no longer be any commentaries, the first 6 were done at a Farscape Convention last year, and as of now there are no words of any future ones, that is the biggest change (I'm crossing my finger for the commentaries, but it isn't likely.)  It will feature a short interview with Virginia Hey, the actress that plays Zhaan in the series, and 5.1/2.0 Dolby surround audio, definitely much less than the previous three DVD released.",989107200,11,904,4.7025316455696204
1414188,5,B00005AMQR,"I am totally enjoying the DVD releases of Farscape. The sound is outstanding (listen on headphones!) and the picture quality is nearly perfect. Only briefly are there any unmoving background shots which take on a static, unreal matte quality. Alyssa-Jane Cook is wonderful as the PK Tech Girl; wish they could have kept her in the series. Like others, I miss the audio commentary on the later discs. Still, these are fantastic releases. Buy them now!",998697600,2,450,4.934210526315789
1414189,5,B00005AMQR,"I believe that it was ADV's president that said that this is the only way they could release the series.  Henson demanded (and rightfully so) that the audio/video quality be high, so there are two episodes per dual-layer DVD (1 ep per layer).  I believe the UK discs are two single-layer DVDs per pack with four episode (2 eps per layer).  What this means is that there is nearly twice the bitrate on the American discs and the shows look fantastic.
Adding one more episode to the disc would be akward because it would mean a layer change in the middle of the second episode (as well as the diminished quality based on the bitrate).  Adding another disc would make them more expensive, and the major retailers won't buy ...discs from smaller companies like ADV.  Neither will they buy the bigger box sets...
So the choices are: (1) A little more expensive with knockout video (2) Reduce the quality (and I don't think this was an option because of Henson) (3) NO DVDs
Given these choices, we should be glad we're seeing these at all...
And it looks like V7 may start a slightly cheaper pricing scheme as well....",998438400,6,1112,4.567839195979899
1414190,2,B00005AMQR,"While the first 3 DVDs had entertaining audio commentaries on the episodes, the 4th DVD does not.  Indeed, the ""extras"" are production designs and a D'Argo profile, of which half of the footage is recycled from eariler DVD extra footage.
Given that they are only putting 2 episodes on each DVD, this really felt like they are socking it to us.  I was rather ticked about the whole deal.  If it wasn't such a great series, I would never contemplate buying another DVD.  As it is, they better not skimp on the extras on the future DVDs, or they will have one fewer customer in me.  :(",995241600,3,582,4.401869158878505
1414191,2,B00005AMQR,It is a bit of a rip to only release 2 episodes per DVD.  I was dealing with that fine.  The commentary tracks on the past DVDs made up for it a bit.  This one has NO extras at all and yet is still priced like the prior ones.  ADV and Jim Henson should be ashamed.  I think I will stick with my dub tapes rather than get this DVD.  I returned mine.  Sad to say though that people are still going to buy these no mater how overpriced they are.  The episodes on here are great though.  PK Tech Girl develops some of the emotions between Aeryn and John.  That Old Black Magic shows some of Zahn's dark past.,994982400,4,604,3.9583333333333335
1414192,5,B00005AMQR,"These two episodes are just too perfect. You get one with a bunch of aliens and the other that has a direct link to the story. ""PK Tech Girl"" shows that John has has more than one woman in his life. The crew Moya uncover the Zelbinion. The most feared ship in the Peacekeeper armada and it's dead. They find one tech aboard and soon the Sheyangs arrive. The Sheyangs are scavengers that resemble a mix between a toad and a turtle. When they arrive, John, Aeryn and the tech get the defense shield activated, but one Sheyang makes it through. After Aeryn does a little dirty work, the Sheyangs decide to retreat. Another little event in the episode is Rygel reliving his horrible memories of being tortured on the Zelbinion by Durka. In ""That Old Black Magic"", a sorcerer named Moldes decides to have a little fun with John and Crais. Moldes feeds on violence so when Crais is transported to a maze with John, carnage ensues. However, Zhann has a few tricks of her own. Sadly, there is no commentary track. The only extras on here besides the D'Argo Profile, Image Gallery and Conceptual Art is four ADV trailers of other shows. However, the two episodes on the disc are EXTREMELY entertaining and never fail to amaze. If you disliked the episodes on Vol. 3, I strongly recommend you see this volume.",993600000,,1299,4.555555555555555
1414193,1,B00005AMQR,"I cannot recommend that anyone buy this DVD.  With only 2 episodes and ""bonuses"" that consist of the un-shortened episodes and ""ADV Previews"" (since when are *previews* a bonus?) this is a poor example of the DVD product.
Frankly, although I like the unshortened versions and enjoy the show in general, I think the average fan would be better off waiting for re-runs (or perhaps buying the VHS) than buying this DVD.
I'm hoping the next one will be better.",993600000,,456,4.7

Deal with it, and rate the show for what it is: one of the most original and enjoyable sci-fi series' ever made.  Both episodes on this particular disc lay the foundation for key future plot elements later in the series, so this DVD is definitely a ""must-see"" for emerging Farscape fanatics.

1414197,3,B00005AMQR,"In the rush to capitolize on its own growing cult-status, Farscape is being crushed under the weight of its own self-importance--and nowhere is this more vividly, blatantly displayed than in the DVDs. At two episodes per DVD--and with extras that continually diminish in quality and interest with each issuance--Farscape appears dead-set on sabotaging its own success. They can no longer count on the ""previously unseen footage"" aspect being a fan draw as ""previsouly unseen footage"" more than not means extraneous footage that either slowed or confused the story's progress or was so bland and uninspired that it lessened the impact of the story. Which is why this ""previously unseen footage"" was edited in the first place. I am still confused as to why the producers of these DVDs have maintained the commercial breakpoint blackouts as opposed to seamlessly continuing a story. At the rate at which these DVDs are being issued, I will probably loose interest altogether. And I consider myself a fan of the show! Ah, well. Seems John Creighton's greatest and most dangerous adventure is turning out to be finding himself lost in the relentlessly stupid and unforgiving world of after-market franchise sales.

1414228,3,B00005AMQR,"I'm not sure what's happening.  The packaging on the first three Farscape disks was superb.  However, disk four has NO COMMENTARIES!  I hope ADV (Who should either lower the price or put more episodes per disk) is not going cheap on us.  Another thing, I thought that ADV was releasing one disk a month (which is far too slow anyway) and now I see that the release date for disk 5 is September!  Hey ADV...you have a lot of fans out here that love the show...don't screw us over, please.  One more thing...why does the UK seem to get preferntial treatment with the releases?  I just checked Amazon UK and they are into the end of Season One if not Season Two by now!  C'mon guys, picki it up.

1414229,4,B00005AMQR,"I am a die-hard fan of the show. I tape every episode that comes on the Sci-Fi Channel. I've bought nearly every piece of merchandise via Ebay.
I've read the complaints about the 2 episodes per DVD. Valid point, but I personally don't mind parting with $20 each month to support my favorite show. I'm going to spend money on this show anyway.
The only reason I give this particular DVD only 4 stars is the lack of commentary by actors or directors. Other than that, it's great! The character background of D'Argo is both funny and informative; Anthony Simcoe is hysterical!",992736000,2,573,4.627450980392157
1414230,5,B00005AMQR,"""Farscape"" is a brilliant, wonderfully weird science fiction show that I absolutely adore. Unfortunately, though, most of the reviews for this disk have been lower than the norm, not because of actual episode content, but because of the way each disk only has 2 episodes on it. I just have to write that I enjoy the way this is coming out. Don't get me wrong. I wouldn't want this to happen for every TV show, but it's kind of nice to be able to buy a disk a month instead of saving up the $... or so you need for an ""X-Files"" box. The other frustrating thing about that is when you're done watching all the disks, you have to wait 5 or 6 months for the next set. At least with ""Farscape"" you get a steady stream, once a month, without having to break up the viewing ritual. Now, I agree that if you were to want to buy all the episodes at once, it would end up being expensive (with it being ... dollars for each set), but as long as you buy one a month, it's fine. Now, about these episodes: As evidenced in each disk, the show keeps getting stronger and stronger as it goes along. ""PK Tech Girl"" finally gives John  Crichton a girlfriend (at least for a few minutes), but on a more serious note, both of these episodes are wonderful in how they allow us to see deeper into the characters' dark pasts. Rygel, who may have previously been seen as a muppet/silly character, in ""PK Tech Girl"" has flashbacks to the torture he received as a prisoner of the Peacekeepers.  And Zhaan, in ""That Old Black Magic"" faces head on the dark powers that she once possessed and used against people. The stories  themselves are excellent as well and add a great deal more to the Farscape mythology. Added note: I read one review that said the ""previously unseen"" footage was deleted because it was boring, pointless, not needed, etc. This is actually not true. This show airs in the UK, where the running time for television shows is longer and the amount of commercial time shorter. The DVD is the complete intended version of the episode, as it is aired in the UK. In America, however, due to syndication rules and a longer amount of time needed for commercials, a few minutes must be cut out of every episode. Sometimes the scenes are inconsequential, but other times they are very important. The first time John and Aeryn have sex was completely cut out of the American broadcast of that episode, including all mention of it, making it extremely difficult for American viewers to understand when this event was later alluded to. These are the definitive versions of the episodes, not episodes with tacked on extra footage.",992563200,,2612,4.494736842105263
1414231,3,B00005AMQR,"...they didn't bother to put in commentaries for both episodes this time. Farscape is an excellent show but they could have done much better with the DVD release. Yes, a boxed set would be wonderfull--I have heard that the first season of the Simpsons will be released in one set--all episodes with commentaries! It is time for ADV to ""get the head out!""
On the flip side (no pun intended--the DVD is single sided!), it is soooooo nice to have the quality that DVD offers. My wife and I catch Farscape on SciFi, and the satelite picture quality doesn't even come close to that of DVD, needless to say.",992476800,,601,4.522935779816514
1414232,2,B00005AMQR,"Well, actually, to clarify, I hate DVDs that have just *two* episodes and nothing more.  I didn't mind so much when the episodes had commentary tracks because I didn't feel quite so cheated.  Paramount started the disgraceful practice of two-episodes per disk but I'm not particularly interested in helping that notion become an industry standard.  The people at ADV could learn a thing or two from MGM (who have their own DVD problems when it comes to movie releases, I'll admit), who just released a reasonably priced five-disk set of the first season of Stargate SG-1, with each episode letterboxed and anamorphic.  And there were extras on each disk, including the four or five episodes per.
But hey, ADV, start putting four or five Farscape episodes per disk, and releasing them in season box sets, and I am *so* there with you. Until then, rather than spending my money on the Farscape two-episode DVDs being released slower than snails move, I'll just save my dollars for season two of Stargate SG-1.",992476800,31,1007,4.871345029239766

I thought they would continue this trend with the later releases but no. Just two episodes and a couple of stupid extras that I don't care about. What happened to the commentary tracks!?! Beyond the high quality picture and sound (which makes so much of a difference on my ten inch TV ... that was sarcasm) what do you get? I my as well have bought the videos. at least then I'd get episodes 7 through 12 as opposed to now where I have to wait for 9-12 to come out on their respective DVDs. It's a real shame too because these 2 episodes are really good. In the first 6 episodes they were still trying to define the series. They suffered as a result (with the possible exceptiuon of episode 4 ""Throne for a Loss"" which is brilliant). At the point where they'd got to these episodes they'd finally figured out what they wanted to do. Both episodes are so great to watch. The evil wizard in episode 8 is particularily enjoyable.

7935494,3,B00005AMQR,"Crichton (Ben Browder) finds love on an abandoned Peacekeeper battleship in ""PK Tech Girl.""  This irks Aeryn (Claudia Black) and gives us our first clear hint of the potential for the great romance that is to come.  Meanwhile, D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe) and Zhaan (Virginia Hey) bluff a dangerous intruder and Rygel confronts old ghosts.  A strong episode.

""That Old Black Magic"" is less successful.  A powerful sorcerer (Chris Heywood) kidnaps Crichton and brings him face-to-face with Crais (Lani Tupu) in order to feed off the resulting emotion.  Despite a powerful performance by Heywood, the tremendous power his character must possess in order to bring Crais into the story makes him too implausible.  In addition, much of the episode is talky and consists of our hero running around in a maze, which becomes tiresome after a while. However, we do receive some important and intriguing insight into Zhaan's character and history.",1099612800,,933,5.18
7935495,4,B00005AMQR,"Well, here I have been watching the Season 1 ""Farscape"" DVDs and praising the tag-team great commentaries I had been enjoying as the best in fan friendly extras (not to mentioning why Joss Whedon has been so skimpy with such commentaries on the ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" DVDs).  So I get to Volume 4, which is the best pair of episodes I have seen to date, and guess what: no commentaries.  I was all ready to give this volume 5 stars but I have to subtract one in protest because I am so disappointed.
""PK Tech Girl"" does offer the old chestnut about the prisoner who falls for the captor, in this case retelling the tale (quite self-consciously it must be admitted) with the titular character, Technician Gilina Renaez (Alyssa-Jane Cook), a PeaceKeeper technician found on an abandoned PK super cruiser, and John Crichton (Ben Browder) in the familiar roles.  What makes this episode work a bit better than that is how this affair irks Aeryn (Claudia Black), plus the fact that this is not a one shot deal for Gilina, which makes this more than a brief but close encounter.  There is also a nice little subplot with Rygel, who was once tortured aboard this Peace Keeper ship and needs to confront a rather significant ghost.
I had been wondering what had happened to PeaceKeeper Captain Bialar Crais (Lani John Tupu), who has vowed to hunt down Crichton in the pilot episode.  Well, in ""That Old Black Magic"" Crais and Crichton are brought together by a warlock vampire type being who wants them to try and kill each other.  Crichton has long wanted an opportunity to explain that the death of Crais' brother was an accident.  This episode gives him a chance to reason with the PeaceKeeper, for all the good it is going to do him.  Meanwhile, Crichton's crewmates are trying a way to rescue him, even though they do not know exactly what is going on.  Again there is an interesting element to the story involving the difficulty Zhaan (Virginia Hey) is having in taking advantage of her long dormant dark side in being part of the rescue effort.  Of the first eight episodes, this is the best of the bunch.
The reason that both of these episodes are above average is because they both have implications for several of the story and character arcs in ""Farscape.""  Like all great science fiction shows, the characters and their relationships are the best part of the show.  By this point in the first season we are starting to learn some interesting things and the characters and their relationships are starting to click.

When the crew of Moya find the wreckage of a legendary Peacekeeper ship, the Zelbininon, floating in space, they go aboard to see what they can find starchart-wise.  But the Zelbinion is not deserted, as Crais left a tech team to go over the ship, and the only survivor, Gilina, hits it off with Crichton.  Meanwhile, Rygel must come to grips with having been tortured on this infamous ship, and the fire-breathing scavengers, the Sheyangs, who arrive on the scene don't make the situation any easier.  This is a lovely story with some good stuff in it, marred only by the Sheyang at times, but the extra footage here doesn't really make or break this episode.  Still, it puts certain story elements into the forefront, provides some background on Rygel, and give Crichton a lust interest that he's not really been given a chance to have yet.  Plus, it acts as the catalyst for several storyline developments down the road (notably in ""Durka Returns"").
The second episode, ""That Old Black Magic"", has the crew of Moya visiting a commerce planet searching for a remedy for Rygel's case of flu.  An evil sorcerer, Maldis, rules the planet through fear and intimdiation, and when he captures both Crichton and Crais and pits them against one another, Zhaan is forced to bring her dark side to the surface to save her shipmate.  This episode is a terrific story with some great acting by Lani Tupu as Crais and Chris Heywood as Maldis, and brings the Crichton/Crais relationship back into focus.  The extra footage here is worth the price, simply because it adds significantly to the background of Crais and a whole new dimension to some of the morality and ethics of the story.
With no commentary versions or any other special features, other than the terrific D'Argo/Anthony Simcoe profile, this DVD is very light on extra features for the price.  I don't know what the reasoning for this was, other than that it was a Henson Company decision, but having the episodes on DVD is the real bonus here.  I gave the episode four stars, rather than three, simply because the Anthony Simcoe interview was illuminating and because the extra footage in ""That Old Black Magic"" made the DVD worth the price alone.",1015286400,4,2605,4.684210526315789

7935499,5,B00005AMQR,"I did not get interested in Farscape until the last 5 episodes of the second season. I don't know why I didn't watch it before. I have been hooked ever since and have started collecting the DVD's as they come out. I would prefer more than two episodes per DVD but only if they were the same quality. ""That Old Black Magic"" is my favorite episode so far. My favorite character is Bialar Crais and TOBM really delves into what makes him tick. ""PK Tech Girl"" was also a good episode. It is interesting to see how John reacts to all the new things he is encountering in their travels. Buy 'em and watch 'em they are the best!!!!!!!!!",998956800,3,629,4.294117647058823
