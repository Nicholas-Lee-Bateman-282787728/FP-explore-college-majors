915985,1,630461442X,this is pitts worst performance to date. thats all i have to say about that,1063238400,2,75,4.066666666666666
915986,1,630461442X,"Were do I begin? It was a challenge just to get to the end of this movie. For one there is much too much cursing, but wait...that's not all. The story isn't interesting at all, in fact, it's down right depressing. The acting is B class at best. Which was a huge bummer. I was surprised how bad this movie really was since some of my favorite actors are in it. It seemed like I was watching a really bad after school special...SERIOUSLY! To say it is a bad film is a sad understatement. It is horrible at best and I don't recommend this movie!",1057881600,4,542,4.171428571428572
915987,4,630461442X,"I viewed this movie several years ago and found it absolutely powerful. As an advocate/speaker on the issue of child prostitution, I found the actors portraying realistic and convincing roles. Sexual abuse, abandonment and exploitation are just a few of the issues presented in this video. Sexual abuse and exploitation of young girls is not a issue that can be under-estimated. The actors took risks and great courage to present a very dark and complex issue in our society today.",1018569600,40,481,5.025

916071,3,630461442X,"SOLID performances by Brad PItt and Julitette Lewis, although what else could you expect? And I say that as someone who is not particularly a Brad Pitt fan, but few people can play an oily, sleazy, lowlife dirtbag as convincingly as he can. I will admit that yes, he does clean up well also. Anyway, those performances aside, this movie offers us nothing new, and it's obvious from the start where it's headed. Still, it's a solid 3 stars even if it is utterly predictable. I would have given it a 4th star if they had included a gas chamber scene, but I guess that's too much to ask in a TV movie, especially in one of this vintage. A good time waster if you're bored and you need one, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it.",1485907200,2,729,4.177304964539007

916131,3,630461442X,"Not the BEST Brad Pitt movie (he plays a real sleaze and it made me HATE him in this!), but young (here) Juliette Lewis is THE saving grace in this boring movie.
She plays young and nave to the hilt here, her innocence showing through  til the end...
After seeing her this year in Secrets and Lies on tv, I never realized what a GREAT actress she really is!
Until I saw this movie.",1481500800,2,381,4.148648648648648
916132,5,630461442X,"I remember when this TV movie premiered back in the late 80's. Whomever chose Juliette Lewis for this role was a casting genius. Shortly after, she was cast in CAPE FEAR, for which she received the deserved Oscar nomination.

Because she was relatively unknown (I did know that she was on the show ""I Married Dora,"" but never watched it), she did not receive top billing.  This went to Michael Tucker, who was a star of the popular series ""LA Law"" at the time.  He is TERRIBLE in this movie but, fortunately, has a small supporting role.
Brad Pitt is in the movie, too, but his performance was nothing remarkable.

Lewis carried the film, with its at-times cliched storyline and dialogue.  She is simple phenomenal onscreen and you will feel for this girl.  It's definitely worth the watch.",1481241600,3,790,4.688405797101449

916134,4,630461442X,"Brad Pitt's young raw performance as a low life hoodlum is creepy to watch.  If you liked this, you must catch ""Kalifornia""  matching Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis again a few years later.  His creepiness takes on a whole new level!!  Both young actors performance gets so much better in the later movie.",1481155200,,303,4.660377358490566

916136,3,630461442X,I've seen this movie twice before and it was very good. But this copy was messed up because it started to stop-start repeatedly 30 minutes in. I have to say there is a problem this same thing happened with another movie called Pictures of Baby Jane Doe. I'm not sure what causes this anomaly with these two films it hasn't happened with other movies-tv shows I've viewed on Amazon. Maybe you can fix the problem.,1479859200,,412,4.506666666666667

The film is amazing in the restraint used in its protrayal, any more graphic and I would not have been able to watch. It is so important for victims to be able to relate, to see their situation from a different perspective, and maybe, just maybe, reach out for help. It is a world far removed from white collar business and the bureaucy that makes the decisions and laws that could help, maybe a few of them could sit still and watch it too.

917719,5,630461442X,"I understand that there are other versions of Too Young To Die out there, starring in the same actors, yet including more scenes.  This movie actually came out in 1990.  I am not sure how I would have reacted to this movie since my feelings on the death penalty have evolved due to learning about the justice system, which many times shows fragmented processing, including judicial determinations.  Some treat it as a game of chess, which is tragic and abuse of procedure.  I greatly resent that.  From reading some facts about he true life story which this movie is inspired by, I see significant differences which detracts from the movie.  I don't believe people should be lead to believe this film is BASED on a true life story, but one inspired by the true life story.  The movie's production techniques has you hooked as far as invoking feelings.  The stars - Pitt and Lewis - played their roles so believably that I felt like they had to have been those characters in real life, not that they really were. Lewis had a harder role since her character had so many layers - growing up and not liking it, being a victim of abuse, struggling with her life purpose and survival, struggling with a drug-infested environment which leads me to believe it was forced on her.  And lastly, struggling with her conscience of right and wrong.  Whereas, Brad Pitt's character pretty much stayed the same, though he did a tip top job supporting Lewis' character and allowed her layers to  be Lewis was the only one sentenced to death and the actor who played Gray seemed to have got off scott free.  In fact, in real life, Lewis' character (Cannady) is on probation.  Gray may be still serving time in prison, but when I do a search for the Mississippi DOC, the system indicates none found. Yet by searching on his full name with and without inmate search, I find the same DOC link , yet actually telling me he is still serving time there.  Strange.  The movie didn't inform the viewer what the attorney pleaded for her and what the counts exactly were.  My impression is, the prosecutor was out for blood and would not cut any deal.  He sought the death penalty.  I presume if he cut the deal, by reason of insanity, since she was under the influence of drugs, then there would be no need of trial.  YET, she would not have been able to continue with appealing (as in real life) and actually get out on probation. The issue of being too young to die versus too young to murder is highly debatable.  In the real life story, apparently, Cannady admitted that she tried to decapitate the air force sgt.  I know false information is posted on internet to sway from the truth and to follow an agenda.  This, too may be the case, since beheadings are occurring alot because of ISIS.  Introducing that type of killing as if it is an accepted way, is quite concerning to me.

( Until she got hurt really bad while being raped - that put her in the hospital for 4 months ) . She tells that story but it is not shown .Well she then falls for Pitt because he convinced her that he would protect her from all the ignorance in the world .

918223,3,630461442X,"I am always interested to find out what the true story is when something is based on that.  In this case the young girl was not led into prostitution etc by her friend.  She had already been involved in the dancing etc at more than one club when she met him. She may not even have met him until after her relationship with the victim had ended. She did live with the man that she murdered but when he found out how old she really was he told her she had to move out. There were 3 people who went together to commit the crime but she had already gone to his home yelling & creating a scene a couple weeks prior. It was her idea to go there to supposedly take his van and beat him up etc..  They kidnapped he and his girlfriend and she encouraged her crime friend to rape the girlfriend as she drove the van, which he did.  After the friend removed the victim from the van the girlfriend got away and ran to a house for help.  The next day the mans body was found stabbed to death.  Her and her friend both pointed fingers at the other one for doing it.  I don't believe anyone influenced her to do what she did.  She was given life in prison but has since been paroled.  Sometimes when watching these kind of stories you are left thinking the person had no choice because of their influences etc. I think it is interesting to find out the real story",1356912000,31,1348,4.114503816793893

918226,3,630461442X,"I finally saw this film the other night, after having it on a wish list for a long time.  I'm mixed on Brad Pitt - I think that his later work is really good, while his early work is pretty borderline at best - and Juliette Lewis has her moments.

This was a made-for-TV film, so you know that it won't have amazing production values, which is OK.  I'm not a big special-effects guy anyways.  But there is one glaring flaw with this film, a flaw that you won't know just by watching:  it is based upon an actual case, but the story was changed from that case so much that it loses its value.

I have nothing wrong with writers and directors taking liberties with a story.  But sometimes, truth is stranger than fiction so why change it?  But here, the original motivation for the film was to take a left-leaning stance on capital punishment I believe, trying to show that our system is flawed.  Well, that would be fine, except for the fact that, if you read the real story, you will find out that the Attina Cannaday character - one of the convicted killers, played by Ms. Lewis - while sentenced to death, actually had her sentence commuted and she was free on parole a few years ago.  I won't give anything away, but the movie ends quite differently.

Also, there were three perpetrators; not two, as the film portrays.  Why did they change this fact?  For dramatic effect?  I'm not sure, but I don't believe that it was necessary to change this in the movie.  And the gal who is a victim was treated, in real life, much worse that was portrayed here.  Why was this changed?  I think I know why, but I'll let you decide if you give it a viewing.

Almost a pass here, since they obviously changed the story for political gain.  Now that would be a true crime.",1350864000,23,1761,4.330275229357798

918228,2,630461442X,"Never thought I'd give a movie starring Brad Pitt such a low rating, but this is one very depressing story based on a real crime. Juliette Lewis plays Amanda Sue Bradley, who by the age of fourteen had been repeatedly raped by her step-father, abandoned by her mother, and set adrift. Billy Canton (Brad Pitt) picks her up and sells her for a dirty dancer, fills her with drugs and uses her most brutally. The problem is, the character he plays is a very realistic one: I've run into a few like that in my time. Good looking enough to be alluring, but bad to the bone.

One day a soldier named Mike (Michael O'Keefe) is in the bar and defends her when Billy starts hitting her. He's older, and shocked to learn she's only 14. Recently divorced, he takes her home to his two kids. He tells her he's not going to sleep with her because she's too young, but instead she can stay and be housekeeper. That works OK until one night she slips into his bed to ask him to hold her when Billy has called her and frightened her.

But he's a soldier, and eventually his commanding officer is informed of the underage girl living with him. He's forced to toss her out to avoid being court-martialed. Of course Billy is right there to pick her up and regain control over her, giving her harder drugs than before.

The movie opens with her arrest for murder, but it takes awhile for the story to come out as to (a) who she's accused of murdering, and (b) whether or not she is guilty. But the title of the movie may give you a clue: much of it is based on the fact that Oklahoma has a death penalty, and the DA wants to try her as an adult.

Too young to die? Yes, in my opinion, she is.",1336694400,2,1672,4.1993769470404985

This is a good watch, but only because you know who these two stars are.

Her lawyer was just a weak whimp. The characters just said what they were supposed to say, not conveying any conviction or sympathy.
