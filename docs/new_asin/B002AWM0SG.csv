3892739,3,B002AWM0SG,"A fairly enjoyable romp through scenic Florida parallels one man's journey to discover just how twisted his childhood really was.

The film managed to hook me visually with some creative and colorful shots, and while the plot had its awkward moments, overall it managed to convey its ultimate purpose with relative ease. While the protagonist of the picture tended to grate at times (and it was probably just me anyway), the colorful cast of strange folk he meets along the way kept things fresh.",1250121600,,496,4.904761904761905
8360544,5,B002AWM0SG,One of the best original film! It exceeds expectations! This is my second copy. A must have in your video library. Especially like the bus driver in the final scene! Enjoy!,1388620800,,172,4.580645161290323
8360545,3,B002AWM0SG,"Full Grown Men is a strange type of comedy in that some of the jokes work pretty well while others... not so much.  The pacing is really slow in the beginning and doesn't really pick up until 20 minutes later.  Thankfully the film is really short at just under 75 minutes so it's not a big loss if you happen to find yourself watching it.

It's about a 35-year old man (Matt McGrath) who refuses to grow up and as a result, finds himself being thrown out of the house by his wife and no longer able to see neither his wife or their child.  He then asks his friend to take him to an amusement park where he can be as immature and child-like as much as he wants.  This sounds like the potential for a funny movie but unfortunately the awkward pacing really hurts it enough for me to lower the rating by 2 points and make it a 3-star movie and nothing more.

I think what would have helped is to show a segment with the man and his friend as children growing up and having a friendship together.  This would help provide some kind of emotional attachment to the characters and stress the importance of how good it feels to be young.  Then we as viewers would be able to relate to Matt McGrath.  Instead the writers chose to not include any segment like this and show Matt's character basically teaming up with his friend, sharing a few memories, and off they go (to the amusement park).  Not too appealing.

Don't get me wrong though, some of these jokes are really funny.  The segment with the hitchhiker surprising the two friends by pulling out a gun and not being able to shoot it is a really memorable one (""It was working yesterday!"") along with the midgets beating up on Matt McGrath's character after a failed clown joke at a bar.  Later on when the two friends split up, I really like the relationship with Matt's character and the little boy he meets during a van ride.  This is the only emotion I could sense.  Oh, and when Matt tells a story in front of the children that makes them cry which is NOT the reaction he was going for and subsequently gets him kicked out of the van... another good one!

On the negative, all the action figure appearances and jokes are REALLY bad.  Only the one where Matt wanted to hand over a high dollar action figure to an old man who's a collector caught my attention, and this is only because of the ridiculousness of Matt frantically trying to reattach the head so the old man wouldn't realize it was ripped off, lol.

Overall, not bad but the feeling that the movie is severely undeveloped will probably recur in your mind as you're watching it.  A great idea for a storyline unfortunately not delivered in a satisfying enough way.",1358467200,,2677,4.3717171717171714
8360546,3,B002AWM0SG,"This film despite the high hopes I had for it, ended up being painfully average; yet still watchable. It's basically about a guy who leaves his family and goes on this road trip to try and recapture his youth. He does this by reconnecting with an old friend (played by a pretty decent Judah Friedlander) and trekking to 'Diggityland' which is an amusement park of sorts from his childhood. Of course as is with any road film... there's plenty of odd characters and side stories that develop on the way.

First thing I want to mention about this movie is that visually it's very crisp and nicely shot in a digital sort of way... which I found as a nice surprise for a low budget movie like this. This is a good sign that as digital video gets more advanced and lowers in price; even low budget stuff can look really nice and polished. Now to get back on track... the movie itself could use some work. The main character isn't really the best actor and the character he plays is absolutely unlikeable... he manages to be annoying and crass without eliciting hardly any actual laughter. If you're gonna play an unlikeable character you should at least make that character interesting or intriguing in some way. The story sticks pretty close to what the plot tells you it is... not too many surprises.

I think my major gripe here is that I was thinking I was going to have this fun nostalgic romp and it just seemed to go through the motions a little too much for my taste; and because of that I never really got fully into it. It's still a decent movie, and I think it's worth a rent especially if you enjoy road movies; just don't expect greatness. 3/5 stars.",1294272000,,1658,4.4506578947368425
8360547,1,B002AWM0SG,"The premise of the movie is great, ie: We all have to grow up, and look what happens if we choose not to. I realize, yea, this movies budget must have been like $10,000 or something, but for me it was a waste of 1 hour and 18 minutes( yes it's very short). I know hollywood is a jungle and it's hard to make a buck, but I still can't understand how very good actors and actresses end up making a movie like this. I mean it has Joie Lee in it...you know Joie Lee right??? She's Spike Lee's sister, she was great in ""Mo' Better Blues""....I mean should have been nominated for supporting actress great. The acting is like read your lines surfacey, no depth anywhere, characters show up and then are gone....where did they go??? I give it one star, and can't think a good reason to watch it.",1279929600,,787,4.218543046357616

8360549,4,B002AWM0SG,"Honestly?  I bought this movie because Amy Sedaris is in it for about five seconds.  Turns out that Judah Friedlander is a decent actor outside of 30 Rock.  If I remember right, this movie isn't very expensive and is a fun indie comedy.  Nothing very inappropriate in it and definitely worth seeing.",1259539200,,299,4.6923076923076925

The action and drama where a perfect combination along with a entertating and fun loving plot. it a must see and I give it a A+++ rating for its performance, buy it today you won't be dispointed! I know it is not rated, but I did take my 10 year old to see it and he loved it too!!!! Randy N",1257552000,,410,3.835294117647059
8360551,5,B002AWM0SG,"Indy film ""full grown men"" visits the mind of Alby Cutrera, who is kicked out of his house by his wife because it's often difficult to tell who's younger; Alby or his young son. With nothing better to do, he decides to revisit his childhood, when times were perfect, mermaids were real, and moose could talk. Alby talks his schoolhood friend Elias, who has a completely different view of their shared experiences as children, into taking him to Diggityland, because Elias is going that way anyway. When Elias tries to get through to him, Alby remains stuck in the past as he now believes it was. Even when he is confronted with some ugly information about one of his childhood heroes, he is still unwilling and unable to leave his childhood behind. Alby's attempt to revisit those perfect days does, finally, show him that one can't really go back, and, maybe, in the process he grows up a little. Maybe...",1257465600,,906,4.66875
8360552,5,B002AWM0SG,"I love this movie. It's funny and heartfelt and serious at the same time, and has brilliant performances -- particularly from Judah Friedlander, who absolutely stole the show for me when I saw it at the Tribeca Film Festival premiere (long before he turned up in my favorite TV show (30 Rock) by the way), and Alan Cumming, who I'd like to see more of. He's such a great actor. How come he's not in more movies? Hopefully these filmmakers will put him (and Judah) in their next movie.",1252972800,,484,4.449438202247191
8360553,5,B002AWM0SG,"Coming of age takes longer for some.  This film belies its low-budget indie background.  Great acting by many new up and comers, as well as a blast from the past or two.

Diretor/photographers really take advantage of the Florida color saturation to create a film that has an incredible, rich color palette -- somthing you don't often see in cinema.

Well worth the time, and the bucks.",1251331200,4,386,4.7164179104477615
