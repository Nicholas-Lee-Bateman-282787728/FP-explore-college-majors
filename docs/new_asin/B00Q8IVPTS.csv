8690906,1,B00Q8IVPTS,I buy lots of DVD on Amazon but I'm thinking of stopping.  This the 2nd dvd I've purchased that is not formatted for U.S. dvd players.  This should have been clearly marked in the product description.  I am not happy,1489104000,,216,4.35
8690907,4,B00Q8IVPTS,"This product is not to bad, very enjoyable to watch.  Mostly artful defenses against the bokken attack, very little on actual bokken techniques which is why I bought the DVD.  Never the less I still enjoyed it.",1425686400,3,210,4.648648648648648
