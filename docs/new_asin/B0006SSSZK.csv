2194208,3,B0006SSSZK,"The previous Amazon reviewers have done a good job of summarizing the plot of this 1950 B-movie noir.  They have done equally well with the numerous faults to be found in this unimpressive, barebones edition.

Overall, ""Woman on the Run"" is enjoyable enough on its own merits.  It is a member of the large sub-class of San Francisco-based movies.  And that's what I'll take as my text.

The film seems to be one of those that followed along the trail blazed by 1947's ""The Naked City.""  The old, cozy backlot sets have been abandoned in favor of gritty location shooting to the extent that the City is intended to be as much a character in the picture as any of the actors.  ""Woman on the Run"" starts out with a night-time location shot showing a man walking his dog up one of San Francisco's many hillside stairway-streets.  It so happens that I do not recognize that particular staircase (after all, I lived in the City for only 32 years), but it appears to be on Russian Hill.  At the time, that was a neighborhood precariously balanced a step or two above hardscrabble.  It was consistent with the economic status of the married couple at the center of the drama.  (It is shuddersome to contemplate just what it would cost to buy a house there now.)

From Russian Hill, director Norman Foster and cinematographer Hal Mohr hit the required set-ups for any SF movie: the cable car coming up Powell Street to drop off a shapely passenger, the lordly buildings crowning Telegraph Hill, a couple of shots of Chinatown, a glimpse of the Tenderloin, interior shots of Gilded Age saloons in which  the verb ""to Shanghai"" was invented to describe a common practice in the Bad, Bad Old Days (some still there and almost as dangerous as ever to the naive and unwary), hilly residential streets lined with three-story Victorian houses, working piers at the perimeter of the Ocean and Bay-bound City.

The effect of all this is, however, rather different from that achieved in ""The Naked City.""  That picture was a love letter addressed to New York.  This one is a cheap penny postcard addressed out of a weary sense of duty to Aunt Minnie back in Duluth.  It is really quite striking to discover how director and cinematographer managed to convert some of the most eye-catching scenery imaginable into so such a lengthy sequence of undistinguished and often dull images.  Perhaps they had no budget to spare for mere visuals.  Perhaps they had no time for effective set-ups.  Perhaps they lacked the talent to perceive what lay before them.  Maybe they didn't care.  Or all these things together.

The final lengthy sequence of ""Woman on the Run"" is set in what the actors on screen call ""the amusement park.""  Now, San Francisco in those days certainly had an amusement park.  On formal occasions, it was called ""Whitney's Playland-at-the-Beach,"" but just ""Playland"" was sufficient for the other 99.9% of the time.  ( It is no longer there and the debacle that led to its destruction still leads San Franciscans of my generation to pronounce the name of developer Jeremy Ets-Hokin with a snarl.)  As a child, I couldn't quite claim the noble appellation of ""Playland-rat,"" but I spent my fair share of time there and knew the place fairly well.

The sequence begins well enough with Laughing Sal, the mannequin that marked the entrance to Playland.  After that, though, nothing quite jibes with my more than fifty year-old memories.  The action takes place in a real amusement park, sure enough, but not the one I remember in San Francisco.  This onscreen amusement park is narrow and linear and all painted white and apparently based beside the water or on a pier directly above it.  None of that was true of the Playland I remember.  Either my memories are seriously out of whack or, having grabbed their required quota of scene-establishing shots up north, the movie crew  retreated to some local amusement pier in Southern California for the big, melodramatic closing sequence.

""Woman on the Run"" is a solid B-movie offering decent performances from Ann Sheridan and the underrated Dennis O'Keefe and some pleasantly noir-ish touches.  If you don't set your expectations too high, you'll find yourself pleased when you see it.

This is a three-star DVD ... but on the high end of the three stars.",1176076800,,4294,4.7853260869565215

This movie would probably be a B or B+ if you could make out what the characters are saying or not be bothered incessantly by skipped dialogue and a horribe DVD picture transfer.

Even the gorgeous Ann Sheridan doesn't look so hot in this movie.  It may be that God-awful hair style.  Or else it's just the D-- picture quality.

2194212,4,B0006SSSZK,"The title of ""Woman on the Run"" might give the impression that the woman in question is running away from something. Actually, it is her husband who is fleeing. She is running after him. The story takes place within a 24-hour period in San Francisco. While out walking his dog one evening, Frank Johnson (Ross Elliot) witnesses the murder of a grand jury witness who had been set to testify against a prominent gangster. Since Frank believes he can identify the killer, the police want to place him in protective custody. But Frank fears for his life and gives them the slip. So homicide Inspector Ferris (Robert Keith) solicits the cooperation of Frank's wife Eleanor (Ann Sheridan) in tracking him down. But Eleanor proves slippery too. She teams up with journalist Danny Legget (Dennis O'Keefe), who proposes to help her in exchange for an exclusive when they find Frank.

""Woman on the Run"" revolves around the character of Eleanor Johnson, a smart-mouthed woman whose enchantment with Frank's artistic talent has turned to bitter exasperation with his lack of confidence after several years of marriage. Frank is a talented painter who works as a window dresser and stubbornly refuses to sell his work. When Eleanor learns that her husband's life may be in danger, she is torn between feelings of worry and contempt. Eleanor learns a lot about Frank that she never knew as she visits his doctor, his employer, and his acquaintances in an exhausting search that forces her to recall their early years together. The story is Eleanor's soul-searching. But Eleanor is tough-taking and quick-witted, not sentimental. Her repartee with Inspector Ferris and Danny Legget is smart and entertaining. Ann Sheridan is due the credit for making Eleanor a forceful personality whom we can believe both as a bully and as helpless. Film noir buffs will find ""Woman on the Run"" more than worth its short 1 hour and 17 minutes run time.

The DVD (Alpha Video 2005): This is a print in need of restoration. The picture is plagued with black and white specks, and the sound needs cleaning up a bit. This didn't interfere with my enjoyment of the film, but whether you would want to own the film in this condition is another matter. The only bonus features are a catalog of other Alpha Video titles and some previews. No subtitles.",1124582400,10,2316,4.860759493670886
2194213,4,B0006SSSZK,"Ann Sheridan was one of the more talented and charismatic actresses from the late 30's through the early 50's.  She was equally at home in serious dramas such as They Drive By Night and comedies such as George Washington Slept Here.  Woman on the Run is one of her rare Film Noir appearances, and it's a good one.

She plays the wife of a man who has witnessed a murder, and is now himself a target.  He runs away from the police, preferring instead to hide.  What becomes apparant is that their marriage has been in trouble for some time, and neither of them seems all that concerned about the other.  As the movie plays out they both come to realize that they each share in the blame for the status of their crumbling marriage, and they both come to want a second chance.  Sheridan's performance is particularly believable as a woman who had resigned herself to either a bad marriage or an inevitable divorce.  Her turn from an indifferent wife to a woman desperate to rekindle something that she knows she herself is half responsible for losing is particularly well played, and fairly well written in the script as well.

Dennis O'Keefe is solid in this film, as usual.  An underappreciated actor in his time, he has become largely forgotten - but undeservedly so.  He was a very good actor who found a home in film noir, and with yet another resurgence in the popularity of that genre he may yet be discovered by a new generation (and rediscovered by older ones).

Woman on the Run is not a great movie, but it is a good one that is well worth the time for any serious fan of film noir to watch.  The direction by Norman Foster is actually quite good, and the script (as noted previously) is good as well.

The DVD, on the other hand, is only passable.  The picture quality is middle of the road for a public domain title, and the sound is a bit distorted (particulary at the beginning, but also at any time that the soundtrack gets louder).  Still, it is watchable, and for now the Alpha (Gotham) version is the only one available on DVD.  Hopefully VCI, Image, or Roan will release this one in the future, but for now I would still recommend this DVD to fans of film noir.",1119657600,28,2178,4.4185463659147866

2194224,5,B0006SSSZK,"Frank Johnson is out giving his dog a late night walk when he sees a gangland murder. Realising he is the only witness he decides he has a better chance going into hiding. Meanwhile the cops get his estranged wife involved  this is Ann Sheridan  who is brilliant. She is not sure if her husband is running from the mob or from their failed marriage.

Then Dan Legget (Dennis O Keefe) arrives on the scene as a newspaper man with an inquiring mind, a way with words and the cash to help them get out of San Francisco. However, both the cops and the mob are onto him and in the game of cat and mouse that ensues he has to be one step ahead of everyone.

Now to say this is well made is a huge understatement, the dialogue is razor sharp with perfect timing and lines delivered the way they just don't do them anymore, Beautifully framed in black and white and with a story that is part crime, part chase and part romance, this sort of has something for everyone. The acting is all excellent and I loved the time period too with cars as big as small whales and everything that went in the fifties.

2194225,4,B0006SSSZK,"While not on a par with top noirs like ""Out of the Past,"" this is a really decent lesser-known and neglected example.  It does not follow classic noir procedure in that the female lead is fundamentally a good person not out to destroy a male who's attracted to her.  The script is intelligent and the opportunity to enjoy the great old look of San Francisco so soon after war's end is among the film's gifts, as are the good and convincing performances by Sheridan, O'Keefe and the many character supports.  Personally, I'd prefer that the killer's identity had remained unknown until the end rather than being revealed mid-film, but that's a minor issue in what I consider a well-done vehicle.  Incidentally, I believe the director is the Norman Foster who'd been a leading man in several films of the 20s and 30s.",1469059200,3,815,4.71830985915493

2194231,4,B0006SSSZK,"Woman On The Run(1950), is a tight noir gem that deserves much more exposure than it has received thus far. It stars Ann Sheridan as Eleanor Johnson, Dennis O'Keefe as Danny Legget, Robert Keith as Police Inspector Ferris, and Ross Elliot as Eleanor's husband Frank Johnson. It was directed and co-written by Norman Foster, who was a long time member of Orson Welles' Mercury Theater. Foster had previously directed the 1948 noir, Kiss The Blood Off My Hands, which starred Joan Fontaine and Burt Lancaster. Johnson plays a failed artist who inadvertently witnesses a murder that is high-profile due to the fact that the victim shot was a witness to a court case against a big-time mob boss. Rather than depend on police protection, Johnson goes on the lam, himself. His wife, Eleanor, is not very helpful to the police investigation. There are some reasons for this. First, she considers her marriage with Frank as somewhat failed. In addition, she really does not know a great deal about her husband's outside life. She is not even aware that Frank has a serious heart condition that he even takes medication for. She hooks up with a shady tabloid reporter, played by O'Keefe, who offers $1,000. to Frank to blow town in order to give him an exclusive story. Well, as it turns out, being a noir, there is a big twist that comes with that deal. No spoilers here, however. Twisting through the streets and shadows of San Francisco, Frank, Eleanor, and Legget manage to stay a step or two ahead of the cops. The last 15 minutes or so take place in a waterfront amusement park, with a roller-coaster, mannequins, and the usual attractions. This is where the tension, action, and photography really pay off. Photographer Hal Mohr and Director Foster make excellent use of authentic San Francisco locations, to really amp up the tension and excitement. As far as the acting, Ann Sheridan is truly excellent in her role, and she never fails to utilize her sarcasm, especially with O'Keefe, who is also excellent. Keith and Elliot are also both very good. The script is excellent! One of the best. Especially the dialogue between the major players. Sheridan's repartee with both O'Keefe and Keith is especially a delight. The film also touches on some issues that would come to the forefront in motion pictures in future years. Specifically, the role of communication, or lack of it, in marital relations. The script also creates a complex, iconic structure, essential to the best noir films. When I first saw the film last June on Turner Classic Movies, it was introduced by Eddie Muller, famed noirchaeologist, who explained how the original print for the film was destroyed by a fire in the film studio archives. Luckily, Muller tracked down a print provided by the British Film Institute, and was able to restore it from the 35mm original print. Muller commented that the film had become a forgotten noir that deserved more exposure. The running time is a very tight 77 minutes, with not 1 wasted. Make sure that you purchase the Synergy Archive Series print, which is offered by amazon for a very reasonable price. The transfer is not pristine, but it is very good. I have seen some very poor prints of this film, so be careful while purchasing. All in all, Woman On The Run is one precious noir that we are fortunate to have found and restored! It is in black and white. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! SMRZ!",1447718400,4,3396,4.787052810902896

He's offered police protection but opts instead to hide alone somewhere in the big city.  (The setting is San Francisco and there are plenty of fun, authentic views of cable cars, streetcars, trolley buses and automobiles of the period without the glamorization later ""nostalgia films"" give to those subjects.  You really feel you're walking down a busy street in SF in the early 1950s.)  The story consists of the wife and a reporter trying to find the husband and protect him.

My review concerns the entertainment value of the film only.

WOMAN ON THE RUN isn't likely to round out anyone's top 25 or even top 50 list of film noirs, though that doesn't mean fans of the genre need to skip over it.  Actually, considering the field is rather narrow, and they sure aren't making them like they used to, I'd say that this Anne Sheridan vehicle is certainly worth the effort of tracking down, and may even pleasantly surprise long-time card-carrying members of the Sam Spade club.

What I enjoyed most about the film was its secondary themes, which, while not exactly subtle, were deftly woven into the suspense of the plot's focus.  Eleanor Johnson (Sheridan) is trying to help her husband the best she knows how, despite their fragmenting marriage.  When he becomes witness to a murder and goes into hiding, she thwarts attempts by the police to find him and compel him to testify - which lately has become quite injurious to one's health.  The trouble is, he's hidden himself so well that she also has to hunt for him, aided by the slight clues he's given her and acompanied by a nosy newspaper man who's hungry for an exclusive.  But her manhunt turns up more than just her husband's cold trail - through the eyes of his friends and associates she glimpses the man she married rather than the man she'd become married to.  But can she find him and express her new-found emotion before the killer expresses his?

As I said, not exactly subtle, but yet perhaps a trifle more emotional depth than some other noirs I've seen.  Like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Postman-Always-Rings-Twice/dp/B001B152E6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Postman Always Rings Twice</a>, this is another of its type to poke around the edges of the dynamics between men and women and their sometimes tense, uneasy relationships.  However, I also think the film has several weak spots, most notably the budget.  Almost all of the outside scenes are shot in a studio, with stock film running in the background, and this became almost a distraction, which is unusual for me, as I make great allowances for techniques commmensurate with the time.  I suspect one of the reason it stands out so much this time is that there is truly a unique finale here, as Ms. Sheridan is trapped on a roller coaster ride while her husband is being stalked by the killer.  With the dramatic interplay of light and shadow and the crosshatching of the coaster's framework resembling&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Caligari/dp/B00006JMQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Caligari</a>-style expressionism, the film, I think, could have been a classic.  As it is, the studio techniques cheapen the overall effect.

Another problem I thought was the supporting cast, which were a bit on the abrasive side, especially Robert Keith (father of Brian) as the police inspector assigned to the case.  Even Ms. Sheridan seems a little uneven, though in fairness, the role does require her to go from uncaring, caustic wife to falling in love again.  All told, I'm left feeling the film could have been much more, yet just missed.

Great 1950's line - when the police inspector asks Ms. Sheridan why she didn't  get a job if she was so unhappy with her marriage, she replies, 'Why should I?  That's his responsibility'.  Oh, for the good ol' days.

This edition of the film, included in the Midnight Mysteries Collection, was entirely satisfactory for me, even if I were to watch it again someday.  Plenty of artifacts, yet the action was never obscured during the nighttime scenes, and even with a couple instances of audio drop, the rest of the dialog was clear and understandable.  Presented in 4 x 3, it seems well worth the cost-averaged price compared to the individual release.  No subtitles, no special features other than a short photo gallery of lobby cards.",1347494400,3,4266,5.3283582089552235

8042843,5,B0006SSSZK,"This is an excellent film noir with a fascinating history and marvelous cinematography mixing on location street scenes and studio filming with brilliant nuance and subtlety.

Ann Sheridan plays the wife of a man who inadvertently witnesses a murder while he's out walking the couple's dog late one night. She learns of the event from the police, because her husband, after being shot at by the murderer, runs away, realizing it wasn't just a murder - it was a gangland killing.

The movie focuses on Sheridan, a cold, cynical woman married to a man she's come to despise, and her relationship with Dennis O'Keefe who plays an intrepid newspaper reporter seeking a story.

Frank Johnson, Sheridan's film husband, played by Ross Elliott, is a wannabe artist with a sensitive, sentimental streak, and an insecure nature that keeps him from being a success in his craft.

As the story unfolds, Sheridan comes to realize that her husband isn't quite the louse she's come to see him as, and that there is something worth reviving in their strained marriage.

In the meantime, O'Keefe follows her around and ends up falling for this smart and sassy woman with little patience and a sharp wit.

There is, of course, the mystery of the initial killing, the interaction of Sheridan's character with the police detective assigned to the case, who also starts to admire Mrs. Johnson, and the hunt for the man at the center of the story - Frank Johnson.

While most of the film was shot in studio sound stages, the remarkable directing and editing makes it hard to see. In particular, the movie bonus material that includes observational narration by cinema historian Eddie Muller is fascinating because of the cinematographic nuances he points out as the movie unfolds. Particularly interesting, is the history of the film itself - another bonus on the disc.

I won't go into anything more - no spoilers - but I highly recommend this film noir beauty. Crisp dark shadows and all.",1516406400,,1968,4.87125748502994
8042844,4,B0006SSSZK,"Interesting chase film noir, using San Francisco in 1950 as a major prop.

The plot is well done, and Ann Sheridan is a great femme fatale with her snappy dialog, especially with the crime reporter played by Dennis OKeefe..

.The plot has several twists, and there is a very satisfying romantic angle, with a number of interesting characters adding reality to the effort.

""The New York Times"" gave it a fairly positive review; Crowther: Since it never pretends to be more than it is,Woman on the Run is melodrama of solid if not spectacular proportions. Working on what obviously was a modest budget, its independent producers may not have achieved a superior chase in this yarn about the search by the police and the fugitive's wife for a missing witness to a gangland killing. But as a combination of sincere characterizations, plausible dialogue, suspense and the added documentary attribute of a scenic tour through San Francisco,Woman on the Runmay be set several notches above the usual cops-and-corpses contributions from the Coast ...Woman on the Runwill not win prizes but it does make crime enjoyable.

Well worth the time if you like period movies and film noir.

even Dennis O'Keefe is fairly good in this one,
