I thought it was a CD/movie combo, but it's a DVD and it just shows the pictures of the places and people that are part of the recordings.  I thought there was a regular CD to play it in the car, but this wasn't the case.  I thought he'd be able to play it in his car on the way to work.  Disappointed.",1374969600,,347,3.7777777777777777
8039311,5,B00066NA8C,All the funny names and reactions from gullible bar ownes/employees make this a laugh fest.  The calls are all raw and unedited.  Red has become a cult figure and an inspiration for The Simpson's.,1231632000,2,196,4.735294117647059
8039312,5,B00066NA8C,"Any phone prank fan who's clicked on this product knows what it is and what a milestone it's become - so I won't bother explaining the contents of the calls here.

What I will do though is rejoice!  Finally, a definitive edition of the famed Tube Bar tapes on CD. Earlier versions of this material were released as incomplete,substandard products with inferior sound quality.  Worse yet, the ""Tavern Tour"" series of calls could only be purchased in the past on cassette.

  Jim Davidson has come up with a release that all fans of Red, Judy, and Tom can enjoy in a superior package. Along with the CD, you also get a DVD that offers some ""historic"" pictures and an additional Tube Bar song that to this writer mind has never been released.

  This is the essential and definitive release of this material - Period.  Pick it up!",1120608000,2,827,4.5646258503401365
