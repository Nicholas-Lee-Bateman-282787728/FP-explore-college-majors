7908058,3,B00000FA6D,"(spoilers) I love horror movies. I love B-Movies as well. Nothing makes my day more than a cheesy little film about zombies, monsters, murderers, that sort of thing. But to say that this movie was lacking, is an understatement. This movie was pure trash.

I got this under the name ""Mind Warp,"" and decided to get it only because it looked like it could be okay. (Well, why else would we rent it?) The story is pretty basic. Two doctors stick four people in an underground lab and start doing mental tests on them with these brain-machine computers. (Spare the constant ""beep-beep...beep-beep"" from any TV show.)

Nothing really happens. The film's first twenty minutes is about an escapee from the lab who has a file showing all that goes on. Apparently, these tests are pretty much illegal. He eventually gets caught and killed off. Then the four people (a war veteran, a priest, a girl, and some other guy) are tested on. It's all really boring until finally they all start going mad and either killing themselves, or each other, until the abrupt and pretty unsatisfying ending.

Once you see the cover art to this film of a zombie coming out of their cryogenic Mind Warp chamber, you'll think you were in B-Movie Horror Heaven. At least that's the way I approached this film. But boy, was I in for a shock. All and all, very disappointing

Really. It isn't very good at all. I found it in the horror section, and hopefully if you do, too, you will just see it. But it has nothing to offer.",1385510400,,1493,4.559701492537314
