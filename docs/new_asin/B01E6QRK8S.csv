7731732,3,B01E6QRK8S,"The show is great, as always, including  The Bait. The disk setup however is the worst they could have come up with. Each The Bait episode is a prelude to a specific episode of The Deadliest Catch but they are on separate disks. This means you have to put The Bat disk in watch 1 episode then put The Deadliest Catch disk in watch 1 episode, and so on, and so on, and so on. But the worst part of the entire thing is there is no information as to which The Bait episode goes with which The Deadliest Catch episode and NO there is not the same number of episodes of each show. This means that episode 4 of The Bait may go with episode 6 of The Deadliest Catch. The only way to get this info is to go online, to a non-related site, and see which episode aired on what date and create your own episode list.",1474588800,,804,4.025

8757887,5,B01E6QRK8S,"The DVDs arrived quickly and very well packaged. Won't hesitate to order from them again.
LOVE this series!! We never miss it! Every year we buy the newest season to become available. The first time we ever saw Mike Rowe was on QVC decades ago. We then LOVED him on his series ""Dirty Jobs"". He has a distinct voice and a great sense of fun that definitely adds to the telling of these grab men! We're very sad to hear of Jonathon Hillstrand leaving grab fishing; and therefore the series; he and his family are our favorites! There's still plenty of characters and favorites though so we'll definitely continue watching!",1505606400,,620,4.6454545454545455

8757890,4,B01E6QRK8S,"Love this show! Exciting and amazing how these men (and some women) can do this job! You get to know each deck hand, deck boss, engineer and captain on each crabbing boat. You see how when one person is fired or quits, which boat they go to.

There are beautiful outdoor scenes! There is excitement, humor, tears, fears and fun! You, along with the crabbers, celebrate when the season is over and get to go home! Then look forward to the next crabbing season..

I gave it a 4-star because I am not a fan of The Bait, where the captains sit around and discuss their adventures. But the rest of the show is 5-star!",1490054400,,612,4.3130434782608695
8757891,4,B01E6QRK8S,"I like the episodes.  I really don't care about the ""Bait ..."" at the end.",1489363200,,74,3.933333333333333
