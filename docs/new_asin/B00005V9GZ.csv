8608258,1,B00005V9GZ,"This is a good documentary on extreme riding. I have seen others with snowboarding, and skiing combined, but this one is far better. It's strictly focused on snowboarding. If you ask me, I have no interest in viewing skiing at all, so being exclusive to snowboarders is something I like. However, due to the length of this feature, the price is practically highway robbery. Your talking about a half an hour feature (and I'm being generous with that), that is filled with more promotional commercials than anything else. The front of the casing boasts a skateboarding bonus, and thats pretty cool. Also, I'm noticing this feature retails for around [price] used as well. Still far too much money for the amount of material you get to view. [price] to [price] is a more reasonable price, and I'm the furthest thing from a cheapskate. I gave this flick 1 star for the length, and price. The footage was great, but there has to be a lot more footage for a hefty [price] price tag.",1033776000,11,977,4.6531791907514455
