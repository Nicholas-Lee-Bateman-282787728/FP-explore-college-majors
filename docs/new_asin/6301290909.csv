She is now seventeen months old, and we have watched it literally hundreds of times -- she never tires of it!  It is fun, the music is good, and there is some introduction to the world of music...notes, instruments, musical styles.  And the really great thing is that we don't get tired of it either!  We just sing with her.  The tape is almost worn through, and we are ready to order another copy we love it so much.",974851200,12,541,4.254901960784314

7811031,5,6301290909,"I remember watching this video at least since I was 5. Now at 22, and graduating with a music major from college, I realize that my life long, though sometimes subdued, interest in music very likely began with this tape. Always my favorite out of the Disney Sing Along Songs videos, I must have watched it a hundred times, and never thought even once about how valuable the things I learned in it really were. Upon taking my first theory class in college I was shocked to see that some classmates didn't know what scales and arpeggios were. After all, hadn't I sung about them with the Aristocats my whole life?

I would seriously recommend this for any family, even if you do not hope that your child will pursue music as a career. It teaches basic information about musical styles, theory, instruments, and how music is a part of all of our daily lives...in such a fun way that you don't even realize how much you are learning.",1241568000,3,929,4.497041420118343

7811033,3,6301290909,"I actually bought my video in the UK where it isn't called Fun With Music. It's called 101 Notes Of Fun, and the only noteable difference between the US and UK version, is the UK's addition of the song ""Cruella De Vil"" from 101 Dalmations.

Of all the Disney Sing Along Songs videos this is probably the most mature. In it, Mr Owl teaches you quite a bit about music, as well as allowing you to have fun singing along. A commendable collection of Disney songs are here- my favorite was ""Good Company"" from Oliver & Company- very sweet.",1123718400,5,535,4.404040404040404
