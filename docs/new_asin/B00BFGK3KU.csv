The original nine books could never have provided enough material for the nine TV seasons. New stories were created that continued the original characters, as with other TV shows.

Hollywood changes books to condense and simplify them to fit into the allotted time slots and reach a wider audience. These books were written in the mid 1930s from her personal experiences which no historian can match. Laura lost her life savings in the Great Depression. An adult who reads Laura's books can see things that a teenager may miss. The economic depressions of their era are referenced implicitly by the family migrations.
