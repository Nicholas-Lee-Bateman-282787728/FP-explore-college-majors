7830297,4,6302712068,"While many love the updated Mickey Mouse, the classic ""pie-eyed"" Mickey is now also back in vogue. A similar thing happened with Alvin and the Chipmunks, best known for their 1983 cartoon with the Chipettes, Alvin and the Chipmunks. Some great cartoons followed, not to mention the excellent full- length movie, The Chipmunk Adventure. But as far as I know, this video and another singalong, I've Been Working on the Railroad, are all that's made it to video of the classic 1961 cartoon, The Alvin Show.

The Alvin Show features a classic, graphic Alvin courtesy of Format Films, started by animators from UPA, a studio known for its bold, abstract, modern and experimental designs, and famous for the Mr. Magoo cartoons. UPA was itself started by animators from Disney Studios, and The Alvin Show was a triumph of limited animation. Were this a DVD of the entire series, I'd rate it a six. But it's only a video of what I consider the worst part of the show, the singalongs, so it's a 4. The cartoons had great stories with Alvin always up to some hairbrained scheme and David Seville, the chipmunks' guardian, father figure and manager always yelling ""Allllviiiiin!"" However, kids may love these singalongs because the design is so compelling and the Chipmunks, who began  their career on records with ""The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late), are a musical delight (""The Chipmunk Song"" sold over 4 million copies in the first two months of its release). The highlight of that song is Dave and Alvinnnnn! arguing over how it ought to be sung, as they do in these singalongs as well.

Adults may like these videos for a different reason: the songs are folk and popular songs of an earlier generation, such as ""Daisy,"" ""Polly Wolly Doodle,"" ""I've Been Working on the Railroad,"" and ""Ragtime Cowboy Joe,"" so kids and adults can enjoy them together. (If that's not your style, there are CDs of the inimitable trio of Alvin, Simon and Theodore singing the Beatles, Chipmunk Punk, and a country album, Urban Chipmunk, all of which immediately went platinum.) These classic cartoons were seen a few years back on Nickelodeon's inventive Wienerville show with Mark Wiener. This was a very imaginative show in the old style, with Mark as the live host showing cartoons, and there was even a Wienerville Passover special. Any time Wienerville or old teen Nick shows like Pete and Pete show up on DVD, I will be the first in line to get them. Mark showed lots of great cartoons on Wienerville, including some from The Alvin Show, with the little orange Nick logo inserted into the show's opening titles. These two singalongs were released through Buena Vista (Disney) in the mid '90s along with many videos from the 1983 cartoon, and I think this is all of The Alvin Show that's made it to video so far, although like other fans, I hope there will be more.",1109116800,3,2851,4.7555555555555555
7830298,5,6302712068,"This video is recommended for grades Pre-K-3.  I've seen this video before.  I'm surprised that it is out of print but if those little children out there see this video they will love the colorful cartoons.  The chipmunks sing their own versions of ""Ragtime Cowboy Joe,"" ""Old MacDonald,"" ""Polly Wolly Doodle"" and many other songs too.  Not only that but the words appear on the screen along with the songs.  If parents had nephews or nieces who had seen this video with them before they'd definitely recommend this for their sons and daughters if they're between 3 and 9.
This video receives 5 stars.",974332800,5,600,4.730769230769231
