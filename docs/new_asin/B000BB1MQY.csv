Maybe it was the holiday mood, but we really enjoyed it. Ballykissangel fans might like seeing Dirvla Kirwan.",1355270400,2,250,4.704545454545454

I had heard of this film before but could never find a copy of it until now, and it was certainly worth waiting for! As always, the British really know how to make a great film! This charming holiday movie was made for TV in England back in 1999. All the players here give wonderful performances, especially Elizabeth Earl (who also gave a great performance in ""Fairy Tale-A True Story"" in 1997, one of my favorite films of all time), her younger sister, Holly Earl and Dervla Kerwan as their mother. The supporting cast also gave first rate performances and I highly reccomend this movie to anyone who loves great, heartwarming holiday films. This is one of the best I've ever seen!",1234656000,9,770,4.546762589928058
