457133,5,630237264X,"If you are a big fan of the Crue and are wondering if you want this tape - my advice is go for it.

What you get:  The whole program is 45 minutes in length which is partly filled by the five videos.  The rest is very amusing staged footage shot after the Theatre of Pain tour and before recording Girls, Girls, Girls.  Many of the images are used in the Crue's VH1 Behind The Music, so it will look familiar, but it is cool to see it without the dumb voice over.  This isn't ground breaking stuff here but it is worth it to hear Tommy's story that begins with how he had to take a huge piss and to hear Vince's brief impression of the landlord who owned the place he, Nikki, and Tommy lived in and destroyed when the band first formed.  Furthermore, you and your fellow Crue Heads can spend endless hours debating what is real and what is staged.

However, do not pay more than 20 bucks for this thing.  I paid $13 or so.  I'm pleased with my purchase, but there is not a whole lot here (especially if you already own the Greatest Videos DVD) and we all hate paying too much and getting too little.",1124236800,9,1099,4.122065727699531
457134,5,630237264X,"The four band members are followed around for a mock fly-on-the-wall style documentary that exposes (badly rehearsed) scenes such as Mick being pulled over for speeding, Tommy riding up and down the strip and Vince being 'woken' by the camera crew, takes us out to his limo (with on-call driver asleep in the back!) where a couple of tonights laydeez wow passers by with their boobage!
Made at a time when the Crue were at their dumbest, this is just daft, harmless fun, but the scene where Nikki tells the camera that he fears Mick may not be with us much longer due to his habits is chilling in the light of what was to follow... oh and there's music here too; 5 videos featuring Live Wire, Looks That Kill, Too Young To Fall In Love, Smokin' In The Boys Room and the original (and better) version of Home Sweet Home... Duuude!",1116460800,5,829,4.4605263157894735

7825037,5,630237264X,"Motley Crue Uncensored (1986) is a fun and entertaining documentary about the band from around 1981, when they got started, up to 1986.  This video contains five full-length videos - Livewire, Looks That Kill, Too Young To Fall In Love, Smokin' In The Boys Room, and Home Sweet Home.  You'll also see excerpts from Take Me To The Top and Public Enemy #1.

The core of this video really is the interviews with and profiles of each member of the band.  You'll see Tommy Lee being interviewed while riding a motorcycle, Mick Mars being interviewed while driving a 1976 Corvette, Nikki Sixx driving a Corvette and being interviewed while getting a tattoo, and Vince Neil being interviewed while sitting in a jacuzzi in the back of a limo (probably because he didn't have a driver's license as a result of his 1984 car crash).  The stories and comments are interesting and funny.

All in all, a very entertaining video from when the band was in their prime, after the Theatre Of Pain tour of 1985-86 and before Girls Girls Girls.  This video has only been released on VHS, and that was in 1986.  You'll have to hunt down your own copy, perhaps buy it online somewhere.  Maybe some day the band will re-release this on DVD.  It's a fan favorite to this day.",1277769600,3,1251,4.569506726457399
7825038,5,630237264X,"This video was issued in 1986, right after their theatre of pain album was put out, and let me tell you, it's crue in their prime.  Vince, Nikki, Tommy, and Mick are 80's metal life to the extreme, driving Coravettes, riding in limo's with spa's, and of course Girls Girls Girls.

  The video tells a little of how they met, shows their old stomping ground, and has glipses at their first ""Videos"" which were home-made.  The major label videos they do have are Live Wire, Looks that Kill, Too young to fall in love, Smoking in the boys room, and Home Sweet Home.  This was the first home video released by the band, and I believe much of this footage isn't available anywhere else.  Get this video while you can, unless the crue puts it out on DVD, then get that too!!! Worth most prices, easy to find if you look around in used stores, or old rental shops.",1156118400,3,857,4.352201257861635
