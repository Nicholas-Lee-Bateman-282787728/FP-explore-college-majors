8525617,2,6301865871,"With director Fred Olen Ray at the helm and Playboy Playmate Kathy Shower in the leading role, you'd expect enjoyable exploitation fun.  However, this movie is just a complete bore.  Fot T&A enthusiasts, you're out of luck, as Shower remains fully clothed, and spends most of the film in a black wig more suited for a drag queen.  Brian Thompson, so good as the psycho in Stallone's Cobra, is wasted here and for the most part is tied to a chair and tortured.  When he is given the opportunity to get in on the action, he has ridiculous fight scenes with old scrawny men such as Sid Haig, William Smith and Ross Hagen.  Are we expected to believe that any of these guys can even get a punch in with a big guy like Thompson?  Embarassingly, yes, as they all beat on him until slow-as-molasses Shower arrives to help.  Even an early appearance by softcore thriller queen Tane McClure isn't enough to recommend this dull waste.",1368316800,,924,4.530120481927711
8525618,5,6301865871,"This movie is a total bomb. The photography stinks, the acting is worse, and the plot is so bad it's laughable. I however am a connoisseur of B, C, and D movies. I like the one scene where there is a 65 Chevy Belair station wagon in the background of a WWII firefight. The biggest reason I loved this film is because my father played a bit part. He got the part because he owned the jeep they used in the movie.",1367625600,,411,4.024390243902439
