5525776,5,B00AXGX59E,This film was very fun to watch.  It have moments of laughter and a continous reason to smile.  A great film for the entire family.,1366761600,9,131,4.2
5525777,4,B00AXGX59E,"This movie is perfect for people who want to see the main characters grow personally, but not necessarily come together as a couple. The whole family can watch it, but those who like characters to unfold would enjoy this movie most. I enjoyed getting to know Alza, even though she was irritating, Mr. James was more endearing as a hermit who changes. It was a little slow in places. Who would have imagined seeing a Black princess befriended by a white, silent hermit of a man! Go figure. Enjoyed it.",1365206400,20,500,4.566666666666666

5525786,5,B00AXGX59E,"I happened to watch this movie on a Sunday night, needing something light to watch before bedtime.  I didn't hold out much hope because of the unknown actors and the vague description.  But this was one time I was pleasantly suprised!  Is the cinematography not the greatest? Sure, but the plot and the camraderie between the two leading actors makes up for it.  If you want a subtly Christian movie with a message thats full of laughs and clean wholesome fun then this is the film for you.  I had to give this movie 5 stars because the writers accomplished their goal of telling the story and teaching me a lesson while holding my interest and making me laugh.  And being a horror buff that's saying alot, but being a Christian I am blessed to have watched it and hope to see more from them in the future.",1473552000,,806,4.412162162162162

5525788,5,B00AXGX59E,"I did not really know what to expect from this movie but I was quite surprised, it was delightful and I found myself laughing out loud with no one else in the house. These two actors were absolutely perfectly cast, I don't think anyone else would have been as great together, I truly loved it when he told her driving around a spoiled princess was not his idea of a fun time.

5525793,4,B00AXGX59E,I watched this movie sometime back. I happened to come across it again while looking for other movies to watch. I was dismayed to see more than a handful of bad reviews. This a good movie. I'm not sure what the other folks are talking about. It's uplifting.,1465171200,,257,4.375

5525796,4,B00AXGX59E,"A gal trying to get home for Easter is stranded with her car broken down and no tow truck in sight.  She meanders down the road and meets a farmer working on his tractor.  Now, she is a big city, obnoxious female so full or herself it is nauseating.  Christina Kans' acting was so good it made a person want to smack her into reality.  She convinces the farmer to drive her to her family for Easter hundreds of miles away.  He reluctantly agrees to do so.  She offered to pay $1000 and all expenses.  He endures all manner of insults and horrible manners from this gal on the way.  He is the quiet type and not very talkative.  She is an intrusive chatterbox who imagines he is interested in ""all about her.""  Then she insists he talk about himself.  As the story unfolds, she becomes more human and the farmer really has a rough-edged endearing demeanor.  I almost clicked this off at the beginning, but found it quite enjoyable especially when they reached her destination to be with her family and she drops all her offensive metropolitan airs.  Very nice ending.  Enjoyable film.",1462838400,,1083,4.515463917525773

5525808,4,B00AXGX59E,"Not a fantastic movie, but like other ones done by Jefferson Moore movies, it was a nice family film.  I'd seen two of the Perfect Stranger movies he made and loved them and since this was free with Prime, I watched it and enjoyed in.  Beautiful old truck too.",1455667200,,260,4.285714285714286

5525816,2,B00AXGX59E,"The woman is so spoiled and entitled, she is unbearable.  There is some line that was crossed making such characteristics nearly unwatchable.  Because she is such a snot, it makes the reticence of the driver unbelievable as well.

Lincoln added the best touches of humor with that quiet expressiveness... especially after she almost broke his hand.  But the ending left me with a warm fuzzy.  It was light hearted, after I learned to escape the urge to smack her, but it still showed more depth than I expected, by the time it was over.  :-)",1442016000,,413,4.680555555555555

5525834,3,B00AXGX59E,"While the story line isn't bad with the two main characters bringing positive changes in each others lives, the movie is way too long and the viewer is left wondering when it will end.  I for one appreciated the Christian perspective of the film but it was all we could do to hang in to the end.  It could have been much better as a much shorter film.",1441584000,,351,4.147058823529412

5525842,3,B00AXGX59E,"OK, let's be honest. I didn't know this was Christian fiction when I started watching it. Like most Christian fiction, the story-line is pretty dumb. The main actor and actress played flat and uncomplicated/undeveloped characters. They, however, played those flat characters fairly well. There were moments of humor, and there's a happy ending. I'd say it was bearable. Barely.",1438473600,,377,5.406779661016949

5525845,2,B00AXGX59E,"One of those movies that you keep waiting for it to begin & then it's ending. The acting was competent [the lead actress is *darling*, even tho' she was playing an insufferable twit] and the cinematography was excellent, but the story was pretty tedious. Yes, I realize it was ""a movie with a message,"" and intended to foster good Christian values, but I'm sorry, it was too long for the actual content, and completely contrived throughout. It couldn't even offer a proper end to make up for the interminable wait to get there. Basically, it has all the elements necessary to make a good rom-com, w/o any romance or comedy involved, nor the intent to go down that path. If you spend more time reading your Bible than you do watching movies, you'll probably love it, but for us dedicated sinners, it's a pretty dull ride.",1438214400,,820,4.623287671232877

5525862,3,B00AXGX59E,"BACK ROADS AND LILIES : Probably one of the oddest films I have ever watched or reviewed.  The premise: damsel in distress meets sorta hunk-ish guy, HE: taciturn and monosyllabic; SHE: flighty, angry and really not having a good run of luck on this, a most important family holiday.  Easter.  Big deal.  Toss in, just for good luck, some very differing structures, in this case, she's black, he's white. Again, Big deal.
However, her schizoid ""chatty Cathy"" doll mannerisms combined with his reluctance for small talk, and a quiet sort of mood takes over-and finally you get it: This is a christian-themed film.
I'm ok with that, even though I personally am acquainted with some boors and whoors who espouse christianity, yet by their behavior, advertise their facades and deceptions. Their actions do not fit their claims.
This film did not disappoint.  There were some genuinely LOL moments, which I thought lent the entire production some clarity of purpose.  To entertain.  The obvious message was that what we see around us is not necessarily that which exists. Most of us want and/or need, some reassurance for our lives and our purposes for being here. The call back to an essential message here was subtle, by which I mean that the christian message wasn't hammered into our heads.  Wisely, production did not exploit that inner-speak.  When you know for sure you're headed down the wrong road.  Change it or die with it. Attitude.  But what I liked most about this production was the openness of the message within the construct of an entertaining  film.  There's much more going on behind the scenes. This is a good film, regardless of religious tyranny- since it did not feel forced, it allowed an indulgent moment for the viewer, in which we could perhaps see beyond the overall structure of the characters, and relax for the meaning that there was a message to be considered. A serious message, but not one of total despair.  Lines were blurred between the characters, and in this film, less was more.
In sum, I think more people would watch this film for the ""friends for now"" concept and place less emphasis on the religious tenor.  At any rate, a watchable, energetic and astute film, with messages for all, as long as they are open to new and dynamic constructs. Very best point: no cursing. None. For that alone, I intend to find a copy to own, it's that good.",1432684800,3,2378,4.765853658536585

I love that it was just able to be what it is, a movie about what it means to actually care about people and learn things about others and yourself. The actors were wonderful and funny.

If you want a light-hearted movie that you can escape into, brings you some chuckles and ends with you feeling good, this is for you.  The whole family can watch it, although, it is a romantic comedy, so little children would probably not get much out of it.  Highly recommend this!",1403568000,,433,4.3625
5526076,2,B00AXGX59E,"I think this movie was written by and for nine-year-olds. I'm not trying to be critical, just to represent it accurately. For example: the male lead explains his past by saying, ""I used to do bad things."" So, the characters in this movie are ""good"". As in, ""it's good to go to church."" And, ""it's good to read the bible."" Some people are bad and some people are good. That's about the depth of it. Not a trace of any racial dynamics. Satisfying for anyone who despite living on Earth is still capable of thinking so simply. Kind of remarkable actually.",1403222400,2,552,4.475247524752476

1. No subtitles for those with hearing issues and audio & pronunciation quality.

3. No cell reception with actor walking around holding phone in the air (there are actual websites devoted to movies with this timeworn hook).
4. Over exaggerated acting of annoying female and nonplussed male. Stereotypes en masse. Acting for the camera - acting.
5. Dialogue was so dumb I envisioned it being appropriately spoken by grade school children. Or, maybe a daytime soap TV created by kids.
6. Predictable feel good ending. Yucky!",1400198400,6,615,5.03921568627451

I definitely recommend this movie. It's funny and clean. They don't use curse words or discuss sex. It's just funny with a few life lessons and morals.",1397952000,,481,4.4772727272727275

5526107,4,B00AXGX59E,"Was surprised at how funny this movie was as well as it had many 'adventures' throughout which made it quite interesting and engaging. I was unfamiliar with the cast, however they were very good actors. I think most would be well entertained.",1394064000,,242,4.785714285714286
5526108,5,B00AXGX59E,"I enjoyed the plot very much---it's always fun to see two people from such different backgrounds thrust together for an ""adventure"". The two main characters, played by Christina Karis and Jefferson Moore, were splendid and very funny. Their facial expressions were fabulous!

This is obviously a ""home grown"" movie and it shows in the mediocre quality of the supporting cast and production. For example, the automobile club operator was silly and amateurish. The green-screen effects used to create the passing scenes viewed out the truck door windows were crude (edges of the green screen were too soft and out-of-focus elements like Ms. Karis' shoulder made a poor transition).

But the reason I gave this gem 5 stars in spite of these and other shortcomings is because of the great story, excellent pacing, humor and superb acting by Karis and Moore. Plus, the soundtrack includes refreshingly good original music. It elevated the movie to a very entertaining and enjoyable experience.

If you'd like to relax with a funny movie with a warm heart and a poignant message, this is your movie!",1393459200,16,1093,5.061111111111111

5526111,5,B00AXGX59E,"Alza Bennett's car breaks down and leaves her stranded in the middle of nowhere. How will she ever make it home for Easter now? After a series of mishaps, she stumbles across a hermit fixing his tractor. Moments later, she has convinced him to drive her several hundred miles to her parents' house. After all, it's imperative she makes it home for Easter.

Lincoln has no desire to be pestered by anyone, let alone a spoiled woman with no thoughts of anyone but herself. However, he agrees to drive her, and on the way they encounter all kinds of hilarious calamities.

At this point, it doesn't seem like Alza will ever make it home. And if she doesn't, how will she ever make that good impression on her family that she is striving so hard to make?

Backroads and Lilies is one of those movies I hadn't heard much about until I saw it on the shelf of a local store.  I wondered if it would be a good movie. I wasn't disappointed.

While it starts off a bit slow at first, the momentum quickly builds. Jefferson Moore who plays Lincoln is perfect for the role with his crusty glares. (He also played in one of my favorite movies of all time, Clancy). Christina Karis, who plays Alza has delightful facial expressions and plays her role well.

Backroads and Lilies is full of great lessons. First of all, lying never solves anything, which Alza soon finds out. Secondly, God teaches us to put others before ourselves (Philippians 2:3). Alza clearly doesn't do this and soon learns an important lesson.  Third, serving others can make a huge difference, as Lincoln discovers. His choice not only helps Alza, but also makes a difference in his life as well.

Backroads and Lilies is a wonderful story of redemption. It includes humor, as well as touching moments. There is nothing objectionable and I would highly recommend it for those ages 8 and above. Younger children may not understand the plot and story line.

8558854,4,B00AXGX59E,"A good Christian film that isn't too overtly preachy. It's not a romance per se, although who knows what will happen after the credits? But I like it that both characters are healed and both return to life and/or to God in their own way. This is better-written than the typical christian films and there is no political or conservative grand-standing or issue going on. It's good to see a film where we see normal good southern white folks but the utter lack of racial politics in this did make me raise my eyebrow. All those quirky good-hearted southern folks and no one seems to know or even recognize that the main character is black. As a black woman, i did have to roll my eyes a few times. Sometimes Christian filmmaking are about good-natured people but their desire to create harmony is so strong that one ends up with an implausible race-blind story. Still, it's a good watch. And no nude scenes or --for those who get upset about interracial relationships-- kissing scenes.",1487030400,,983,4.655172413793103

Even though the characters came off as stereotypical, and I didn't fully believe that someone would agree to drive a stranger over several days during a holiday period for only $1,000, I went along for the journey anyway and enjoyed it. If you need something to pass the time and make you smile at the end of the movie, this is the one for you. No cursing. No violence. Not even some sexual tension. Christian but not preachy.",1483833600,,608,4.638888888888889
