8036535,2,B00061U15C,"Interesting from a sociological perspective, but B.B. King only plays two songs, is starting on his third when he is interrupted by a prison guard.  I was expecting at least 20 minutes of his singing, I got 5.",1434931200,6,209,4.5

8036537,5,B00061U15C,"Seriously one of the best concert performances (and ""raw"" music documentaries) I have ever seen! There is nothing ""slick"" about this DVD, it feels ""homespun"" but IMO it's absolutely incredible, historically important footage! Yes, the picture and sound quality are not amazing, but the dynamic performances all but make up for it! A profoundly-moving music concert/documentary like this surely deserves some sort of remastering and re-issue! Please! But enough raving... if you believe music has the power to initiate social change... possibly even make the world a better (more humane) place, buy this DVD!",1302220800,8,607,5.468085106382978
8036538,5,B00061U15C,"This is a recording of a 1972 Thanksgiving Day concert in New York's Sing Sing prison.  Initiated by a group of prison inmates, the show features B. B. King, Joan Baez, Mimi Farina, the Voices of East Harlem, and comedian Jimmy Walker.  The performances are short but powerful.  As important as the performances, though, are the insights that the movie provides into the lives of the inmates and the operation of the prison itself. It includes interviews with inmates, employees and performers, and so provides several different viewpoints of the same sad situation.  More than entertainment, the movie is also an education.",1226275200,9,624,5.088235294117647
8036539,5,B00061U15C,"This film takes us inside 1970s Sing Sing Prison on Thanksgiving Day for a rare concert! Baez's voice is amazing and BB rocks the house! The East Harlem group is exceptional.
In addition to the spectacular performances is a rare look inside one of America's prisons and we meet a few inmates which give a more humanizing view of these people. Watching them watch the concert is the icing on this cake.",1189036800,8,401,4.583333333333333
8036540,3,B00061U15C,"Excellent but short performances by B.B. King and Joan Baez.  Most of the film is a documentary (with concert performances mixed in).  Film and editing quality is mixed (mostly poor).  Most of documentary is shot by inmates.  Sound quality is poor.  Advertised as Dolby Digital 2.0, but it sure sounds like mono to me.",1174348800,13,318,4.814814814814815
