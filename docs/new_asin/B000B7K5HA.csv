8083028,4,B000B7K5HA,It has helped our children learn manners in a positive way. It has helped them learn how they should present themselves in an acceptable way.,1380672000,,141,4.68
8083029,5,B000B7K5HA,"This is a great video! So helpful for families, college students, teens, and just about everyone. It was produced in 1994, so the hairstyles and dress are a bit outdated, but doesn't take away from the message.  The principles are really well taught. The DVD format makes it easy to click on any of the 7 sections ... and this video covers much more than just manners.  I even learned an easier and quicker way to make a bed ... not to mention how to get in and out of a car modestly. Well done and a lot of information about many different areas.",1282176000,,547,4.25

It's a little dated, but still has some good information and the kids still enjoy watching some of the ""comical"" demonstrations of manners. If nothing else it can serve as a conversation piece for a much needed concept - manners.",1255392000,,325,4.433333333333334
