1983504,4,B0001A0EPK,I've just recently purchased a swiss ball and wanted some advanced routines and this video is terrific...I'll tell all my gym friends about it.,1102636800,6,143,5.0
1983505,5,B0001A0EPK,"I have been a Certified fitness trainer for long enough to understand what is ""hype"" and what is the real deal, and this instructional dvd is the real deal. It's way to easy to fail, and if you truly follow the form, which is very well lead, you will look and feel strong as steel in the entire core region, in a very short time. working that whole area and the surrounding extremeties is what burns fat the fastest too-rip it up!

I highly recomend this DVD!",1102464000,17,459,4.275862068965517
1983506,5,B0001A0EPK,I've bought and have been using Swiss Ball Abs for about 3 months now and find the results almost hard to believe.  For the first time in my life there is definition in my midsection.  A great side benefit is that some mild lower back pain I developed is lessening and I've experienced general fat loss.  Yes these video are challenging; but that is a benefit.  Many videos are next to useless because they are dumbed down so much that after a couple of viewings you have mastered them. The stabilility element in Adam's videos add to the effectiveness.  I recomend this video to anyone who wants to gain core strength and defined abs.,1101340800,17,635,4.535087719298246
1983507,5,B0001A0EPK,"This dude Adam Rocks! I have been searching for answers in the fitness and exercise world for about 5 years now and I am ECSTATIC about the discovery of these revolutionary instructional videos! Adam takes you through very easy to do, although super safe and effective routines to maximize your core strenght and develope those abs that we all are looking for. I have almost mastered the first part of swiss ball abs, the RESULTS are amazing, and I can not wait to get the upcoming videos! ANYONE with half a brain could watch this series and follow along and it would definatly help them get the physical benefits they desire.

1983508,1,B0001A0EPK,"It is impossible to get any kind of abdominal workout with this video unless you are very experienced using the swiss ball.

You may spend so much time attempting to get balanced, positioned and then falling off the ball while the video moves on to the next segment that your abs will not get a workout.

I cannot believe none of the previous reviewers commented on how difficult it is to just stay on the ball using the positions demonstrated.

There is no instruction or tips on positioning or balancing on the ball.  After a lengthy warmup, the video just jumps into a routine that many will find impossible to follow along with.

Waste of money unless you are already highly-experienced and highly skilled using the swiss ball or have hours and weeks to practice.",1096934400,12,767,4.651851851851852
1983509,5,B0001A0EPK,"I am a 21 yr old female and I have always had a large stomach.  I have tried many ab exercises and DVD's but this one is DEFINITELY the best.  Most ab exercises are just too easy for me, but this DVD really showed me some new exercises that were very CHALLENGING.  This DVD has three different workouts, or ""phases"" as they are called.  The first one is a little challenging but the second one killed me.  YOU will feel the burn on this and you will SEE RESULTS!  All you need is a stability ball and for some of the exercises you need to lean your feet against a wall.  Otherwise, no other equipment is necessary.  AN EXCELLENT PURCHASE.",1087430400,19,638,4.258333333333334
1983510,5,B0001A0EPK,"Finally!  a fitness dvd that is well presented, thorough, and shows simply and effectively just how to use a Swiss Ball to it's full potential!
Before I found this dvd, I'd been looking for one in the UK for months, but they all seemed to be aimed specifically at women, and were mainly intent on just reducing fat - none of them actually showed you how to use the Swiss Ball to it's full advantage.
If, like myself, you have a swiss ball at home and up to now have only used it as a piece of novelty furniture, then this is the dvd you need to finally make some real use of it!
The presenter takes you though the correct use of the ball and guides you though a series of exercises which look innocent enough until your abs start to scream at you the next day (a sure sign that it's doing the job!).  Just watching the presenter at work is inspiration enough as you can see every muscle the exercise is intended to train flex as as each exercise is perfomed.  It sounds daft I know, but for me, this alone is an enormous help as you can see straight away whether or not your doing the exercise properly by comparing which of your muscles are working against those that are flexing on screen!
Music and other distractions are kept to a minimum, and at every stage you're guided along with an informative but unobtrusive commentary.  You can even hear the presenter breathing, which soon makes you realise when your own breathing is out of whack (something I'm always getting wrong when exercising!)
I'm a 34 yr old guy who's used gyms and other abs equipment in the past, but I've NEVER found a training programme that's been as effective as this!  I've been using it now for a few months on and off, and it soon becomes second nature.  It may take me some time to get the sort of abs the presenter has, but at least now I'm doing the RIGHT exercises, the RIGHT way help me achieve this!",1079395200,15,1886,4.313559322033898
1983528,2,B0001A0EPK,It's not what i though it would be. It is a good video for someone who is beginning to work on abs for the first time but for people who already have been working on abs for a while and have abs this is not really challenging it's way to easy.,1319414400,,243,3.784313725490196
1983529,5,B0001A0EPK,"In fact, I don't have any recommendations for improvement.  Posters and books are fine for free weights, but they just don't cut it when it comes to a swiss ball.  The DVD has 3 Phases that escalate in intensity and will (more than likely) never get boring.  Some people might have difficulty getting through Phase 1.  Simply try modifying your stance or posture until you are able to do them as prescribed.  It took me weeks before I was able to complete Phase 1, but best to see that as part of the ""fun"".  Adam Ford's Abs&Core vids are the perfect instruction for the home gym / swiss ball , period.",1319328000,,602,4.378378378378378
1983530,1,B0001A0EPK,I bought three of his workouts and wish I had not been so hasty.  I found them very boring and tedious and difficult. I wish some one would bring out a good Swiss Ball Workout that was both fun and effective.  This is now going to gather dust on my shelf along with his other two dvd's.,1308355200,,286,4.0
1983531,5,B0001A0EPK,"I discovered you're Swiss Ball workout online about a year ago and was intrigued. I immediately bought all the DVDs and have been working out regularly ever since. These workouts have been great for me, Ive worked out with weights in the past and never had any results and never enjoyed it at all but these ball workouts have had real staying power for me and in my opinion are 10 times better than any weight workout.",1277510400,,418,4.441558441558442
1983532,5,B0001A0EPK,This is a great abdominal workout. Dont worry about the other reviews that say this is too difficult of a work out. The workouts are short and effective and are not impossible. They DO require work however. But isint that the point of any exercise?,1265328000,,248,4.533333333333333
1983533,5,B0001A0EPK,"Outstanding workout for your abs.  After three days of completing all three phases, I can see a line down the center of my abs.  Thank you Mr. Ford.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  It is a little challenging with the ball, but the correct size ball and a place where it can't slide helps a lot when doing these.  Ouch is what my abs are saying.",1249344000,,353,4.057971014492754
1983534,2,B0001A0EPK,"This workout is extremely hard.  It requires excellent balance which I certainly do not have.  I am not in terrible shape either, but i could not do the workouts at all, even the beginner workout.  I spent most of the time trying to figure out how to get in the right position or balance correctly.  It is not worth it for a beginner or even the average fitness person.",1231372800,2,369,4.304347826086956
1983535,1,B0001A0EPK,Wouldn't recommend any DVD for ball exercise.  Nearly important to view video and exercise especially when you doing lying exercise.,1229904000,,132,5.6
1983536,5,B0001A0EPK,"I love this DVD. I love the challenges, the pacing, the variety, and the duration. And the more times you do it, the harder it gets because you can do the exercises more precisely and focus on better form. The music could be better (tho phase 3 isn't bad), but that's not what's important to me.

Granted, I have Swiss ball experience and my balance is pretty good. I've had personal trainers in the past, and have had years of yoga practice. I can see how beginners might have a hard time. Perhaps they could have a friend help them with their form, or just focus on doing a half version of the exercise at first (e.g., just hold push up position with toes on the ball, vs. also pulling the ball in toward your stomach and extending out).

I have a ruptured and herniated disc in my lower back, and have always had a soft squishy belly. Almost every morning I wake up with some level of lower back pain. You'd think the last thing I should do is a core workout. But it truly helps me get my day started without ibuprofen. The stretching at the beginning helps a lot, and the exercises are pretty safe. My core is getting so much stronger. I've been doing this video (mostly phase 2) and the Perfect Abs video 4xs/week for about 2 months now and there's a definite difference in my appearance. I don't have a six pack, but I'm not sure I'd want that as a woman anyway. I'm 36 and my 16-year-old nephew tells me my stomach looks better than his. Believe me, that was not the case 2 months ago.",1227571200,,1492,4.268551236749117
1983537,3,B0001A0EPK,"Three workouts; phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3

Cuing is poor and transitions too fast for a beginner.  If you are a beginner and have never used a Swissball before expect some frustration.  The video will be on the fourth repetition of the next exercise before you are ready to begin.

However, the angst caused by this will fade with practice and as you memorize the video which will render cuing unecessary",1227052800,2,408,4.5479452054794525
1983548,5,B0001A0EPK,I have been looking for a step-up in my Ab program and this fit the bill. The pacing is so correct because it allows me to make SURE that my form AND my breathing are correct. I have been doing Jane Fonda Challenge and Denise Austin's Hit the Spot and Super Stomachs and some Tami oblique work with weights and needed a place to go. This one is it.,1226793600,,348,4.057971014492754
1983549,5,B0001A0EPK,"WOW! That's all I can say. I've been using this video for 8 months now and the results are astonishing. No my abs aren't as cut up as Adam's but my stomach is flat. More importantly I have so much more flexibility in my back. Leaning over the tub to wash my dog no longer hurts. I know that seems trivial but it's nice to know how all the little things seem easier now.

The strength and flexibility to my core has also enabled me to take on other workout regimes that would tire me out only half way thru. Yes using a swiss ball was really hard at first. It kept rolling out from underneath me and stabilization is definitely not my forte but believe me when I say, if you stick with it and really really try, you'll get amazing results.

I'm only 28 but everything around my mid section feels so much tighter. What more could I ask for?",1218499200,,838,4.166666666666667
1983550,4,B0001A0EPK,"This dvd had enabled me to get ""cut abs"" at 45!  The key is to start slow.  Do what you can and progress.  As you progress you will build your strength.  I found myself at phase 2 before long and have been there for almost 2 months  My greatest criticism is that Adam doesn't tell you how to do the exercise.  Watch the video and pause as you need to.  Rewind if necessary.  It might take a few tries until you ""get it"".  For example, the ""Reverse Crunches"" in phase 2 took me 3-4 times before I got it right.  Listen to what he tells you to do.  Don't rush.  You'll be very happy with the results.",1217721600,2,598,4.017094017094017
1983551,1,B0001A0EPK,"Ok, I was really looking forward to this video because it got such rave reviews....but let me tell you. Unless you are superman and have immense strength, this video is not for you! I am an avid excersiser and think i'm fairly strong, but this video was impossible for me to do! I was in pain trying to do these impossible moves! I tried this video several times thinking i would get the hang of it, but to no avail. Please don't waste your money on this video, you will be in for a big disappointment.",1216944000,4,502,4.239583333333333
1983552,5,B0001A0EPK,"On my second pregnancy, I got some virtual ROLLS of fat right on my stomach. Another friend of mine had had twins and said that fat would not go away, so she got her tummy ""tuck"". Not one for the knife, I got this dvd and within 2 weeks, the rolls had flattened somewhat and within a month, I was 100 percent confident that it's just fat. I did this dvd along with running/jogging and have popped back into ""ab' shape every time. I just had my fourth child and have hit the 7 month mark, which is when I start to exercise again. After 16 months of no ab workouts, I have pulled out my faithful Adam Ford dvd and am looking forward to  a great midsection in 6-8 weeks. (really, sooner) Thanks Adam!",1207785600,8,697,4.162962962962963
1983553,4,B0001A0EPK,3 Good levels of workouts. But even the beginners level may prove to be quite a difficult challenge for novices.,1205971200,,112,4.65
1983554,5,B0001A0EPK,"I'd like to echo what others have said about this video: it's clear, well produced, and extremely effective. I've been doing Phase 1 for about 6 weeks, and I can see increases in ab and core strength each workout. (This is partly due to my starting in a rather untrained state.) In the past many ab exercises have given me lower back pain, but I've been fine so far with this workout.

Like the previous reviewer, I had to pause the video during the first several workouts to get the movements right. I also initially found some exercises extremely difficult to do at all. Don't let these obstacles dissuade you--they will go away with practice. For example, Phase 1 includes a side bend for which I could barely hold the starting position at first; now I am doing 7 reps per side, and adding 1 rep per week.",1189296000,3,808,4.45945945945946
1983555,5,B0001A0EPK,"After only three weeks of using this DVD I had results I could see and feel.  I've tried other DVDs and contraptions that promise tighter abs in a record amount of time, but this is the first product that truly delivers!

  I think what impresses me most and makes this DVD so easy to follow is it's simple, straightforward approach.  Fitness expert Adam Ford leads you through the moves, which he thoroughly explains and you are able to take at your own pace.  Because the DVD is so basic without annoying music or visual distractions it's easy to come back to again and again.

Surprisingly, a tighter, stronger midsection wasn't the only positive outcome of using this program.  By strengthening my lower back and other core muscles my posture has improved dramatically.

  I've recommended this DVD to several friends of different ages and all have had great results!  I can't wait to try the other DVDs offered by Ridgeline Fitness.",1184112000,7,937,4.7875
1983556,5,B0001A0EPK,"I have been using Adam Ford's Abs dvd for about a month now 3 times a week. I do exercise quite a lot - I swim 3 times a week and am in the gym a further 3 times. Whilst that is great I was getting bored of my weights routine (which was given to me by a personal trainer who is an expert in body mechanics) and was really looking for something else to add in.

I found Adam's sample videos on YouTube so looked at his website and ordered the DVD. It arrived in less than a week (I am based in Cambridge, UK).

Phase 1 does have some basics moves but all challenge your core muscles

Phase 2 builds upon phase 1 exercises with some challenging exercises which I found made my stomach burn (in a good way!) but as my core gets stronger this will go away and even after a month I have noticed it is better

Phase 3 is more advanced again - I struggle to do the side kicks exercise

Whilst I think every gym in the world has swiss/core balls nobody has shown me how to effectively use it for my core like this DVD does. The workouts are 20 mins long including warm-up and cool-down and I found myself starting to sweat with phase 2 and 3.

Above all else these exercises are fun and can be done anywhere even if you travel for work or leisure you can take the ball with you. Also the 3 phases I feel provide enough variety to stop boredom which can be a problem with other routines.

I have always been quite lean but nothing has started to give me the shape on my abs as this DVD has. I am confident I am on my way to getting the elusive 6-pack that has eluded me for so long. Also the stretching is helping me with my flexibility.

I would recommend this to anyone wanting better core muscles and definition.

1983580,5,B0001A0EPK,"First of all, I agree 100% with the review by ""zenfire"" below.  This is an excellent, challenging, fast paced swiss ball workout.  If you have a swiss ball and you want to learn how to use it fully, get this dvd.

I am 56, exercise every day, and did not use the swiss ball prior to this year.  I have done ab work, stretches, etc for many years, and I find many of the exercises presented in phases 2 and 3 of this dvd to be a real challenge, and I like that!

I also have the Basics workout by Adam Ford.  Abs and Core presents many more exercises, with no stretches in between, the stretches are all done at the end of the session.  Also Basics is done outdoors, on the sand, Abs and Core is done indoors.  The pace of Abs and Core is faster, I often need to hit the pause button to catch up, but as I improve, I need to do so less often.",1166745600,,841,3.93491124260355
1983581,3,B0001A0EPK,"I know all the reviews thus far are good. So take mine with a grain of salt because I am not the most flexible person and this video calls for someone who is.

I guess that's why the workout hit me in areas that were not target areas. I didn't enjoy the workout as I have others.

The video itself is technically great. You can easily go to the phase or workout you want. There are three. In addition, there is an introduction that tells you about the fitness ball, sizing, etc. Very good.

There is also a bonus section with added information. I wish all exercise videos were technically as well produced as this one.

The workouts get right to it. No unnecessary talk. It's a bare bones workout.

But  I was not at all impressed. I think a very flexible person and perhaps a taller person could do these nicely. But if you're short and not too flexible, you might want to try another video.",1163116800,12,892,4.311377245508982
1983582,5,B0001A0EPK,I have a closet full of exercise dvds and as I grow older I wanted something more functional in its approach.  I really like this dvd.  I am only in phase one of three but that automatically gives me a goal.  I like the fact that the exercises are not the same old same old.

This is an excellent training DVD if you want to maximize your fitness conditioning and increase your functional strength, suppleness, agility and coordination. The 3 training segments are each 20 minutes, not 10 minutes as another reviewer reported. The videography is excellent, clearly and simply showing each movement without any fancy fadeouts or quick switches. Each phase is more challenging. I would say that the phase 1 section can be done by most people of average fitness after a couple of weeks of practice. However at first you may need your remote to pause the DVD until you acquire the skill to transition into and out of some of the more challening postions. Let's face it, if you aren't at an average fitness level then you should be doing a different overal kind of training, not focusing on abs.

I've been studying martial arts for over 10 years and been working out with a friend of mine, who happens to be a trainer with the NASM. I've seen and performed many different abd exercises throughtout the years, using a variety of equipment, including machine balls, BOSU, abd machines, Power wheels, hitting my upper, lower, obliques and transverse abdominals muscles. I've also done regular old fashion crunches, bicycling, leg raises, hip thrust, etc, etc, so I'm no stranger to abd exercises. I've been looking for a more difficult and challenging workout for a while and I definitely found it with this DVD. Not only does these exercises challenge your abd muscles using the stability ball, using all three planes of motion, frontal, sagittal, and transverse, but it also forces you to use your stabilizing muscles, which makes the exercises even more difficult. This DVD is truly for the advanced. I highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a new challenging routine. But be warned, this is NOT for a beginner.",1138492800,13,1128,4.973544973544974

I'd spend more time with the dvd on pause trying to get into position to do the exercise.  If you're just starting out, this may be harder.  Compared to other exercise dvds I have, this one is more instructional vs actual workout.  With the workouts Adam does 2 set with about 10 reps of each exercise.  This is good for a beginner but I did not feel like I worked out afterwards other than fighting with the ball to get into position.  I decided to return the dvd before I actually injured myself.",1362441600,,628,4.417391304347826
8009066,5,B0001A0EPK,"I consider myself quite advanced in terms of movement training - having done many styles ranging from Qigong, Pilates, TACFIT of RMAX to Taekwondo. Indeed, I tried this workout because I could no longer find abs and core workouts that really challenge me. And when I say challenge, I don't mean a workout that put my abs to fatigue. I mean a workout that challenges my motor skill...something that challenges my coordination. From the first day that I tried this workout immediately I know that finally I have found one! Indeed, I can find lots of room for improvement for myself even at the basic level. More importantly, I find that this workout just makes me feel good. This is asign that my body responds well and that the movement is biomechanically correct.

Let me say, though, that this workout is indeed not for a beginner especially if you have never tried any other kinds of body work or movement training. The first and foremost reason is not the difficulty, but that you need to be able to evaluate the quality of your own movement. To elaborate, even at the easiest level most of the exercises are done by maintaining neutral spine throughout the movements. Indeed, I find that even the level one routine is even more difficult than intermediate pilates, in the sense that most exercises require that you ""lock"" your spine in the neutral position and keep it there, rather than moving in and out of the neutral position like in pilates. And as with everything else, the most difficult kind of movements is static one.

Having said this, to progress and benefit from this DVD you will need to:

1) know what neutral spine position is.
2) be able to evaluate consistently whether you are maintaining it or no

The second one is the reason why this DVD is not  for a beginner. As with pilates and other kinds of movement training, many beginners will not know that they are not maintaining the neutral spine even though they believe that they do. In addition, to be able to assess and correct one's own movement all the time requires quite some degree of body awareness, which is indeed difficult to achieve for a beginner,

Overall, I still believe that this DVD is very, very good. But if you are a beginner and have never tried other kinds of movement training but still wants to train abs on swiss ball, I recommend that you begin instead with Stott Pilates series on stability ball<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stott-Pilates-Pilates-on-the-Stability-Ball-DVD-Set-of-2/dp/B002I9TZ7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stott Pilates Pilates on the Stability Ball DVD (Set of 2)</a>&nbsp;instead.",1357084800,,2641,5.032036613272311
8009067,5,B0001A0EPK,"I have done both Insanity and P90X workouts which both have their own ab workouts which I thought were difficult.  What is interesting about this one is it didn't feel as hard during the workout but afterwards I was much sorer and got results more quickly!  I think it has to do with the instability but I definitely felt it across more of the core muscles than the previous workouts.

The moves can be difficult to learn and even dangerous if you don't take the time to learn to balance on the swiss ball.  Once you get past that, it is a great, simple workout that produces great results!",1354579200,,590,4.385321100917431
8009068,5,B0001A0EPK,"I'm a chiropractor and I make almost almost all of my patients do this video phase 1, 3 x/ week, and they get excellent results.  When the low back gets injured it loses it's normal control of core and low back muscles and patients show up in my office with pain and uneven leg length.  Adjusting them evens them out, but in order for adjustments to hold, the low back needs to be neurologically reprogrammed with enough of the correct repetitive exercises to remind the brain that their are muscles on both side of the spine and that they need to work together.  I have yoga instructors and Pilates instructors, ppl with huge muscles, all sorts of ppl with pain and they don't know why.  These exercises 3-4x/ week help them when done correctly.  They come in within a few weeks without pain and with nothing further for me to adjust.  Most importantly I've given them a tool that they can use to fix themselves. -Dr. David Sundy, Chiropractor & Knee Specialist, San Francisco",1344038400,2,977,4.586206896551724
