8123072,2,B000FII252,I'm gonna try too keep this short because its really not worth a long review. Gravion was a fun anime with great characters and great music and a well thought out storyline that was spread out well. I gave it 4 stars. I waited patiently for Gravion Zwei's complete release hoping it would finish well but it didn't even come close. The writing was horrible and the way they spread out the story between episodes was even worse. The first 5 episodes were filler and they really needed that time for the story because they failed miserably when they tried to put it all together later. Its just a shame Gravion ended this way. I will probably sell the first season now. You might be asking why 2 stars instead of 1? The animation was done well and it was the only thing better from the first season.,1153872000,8,797,4.391891891891892
8123073,3,B000FII252,"I have only seen disk 1 so far, but I can't exactly say I like what I see.  Sure, there's lots of fan-service.  Sure it's got some funny points.  But the plot!  I haven't enjoyed watching  a giant mech show since I watched Voltron 20 years ago (ok that's dating me) and I was the target audience when I watched that; 7 year of boys. This show has all the cheesy things that I hate about the genre; combining robots, cheesy phrases, the main character calling out the name of each attack.  Now, if you strip out the 5 minutes that they actually get into the Gravion, then you got a pretty good show.  They didn't botch the American voice acting either.  Only problem; I've never seen Gravion and this is Gravion Zwei (or 2 in German).  So there is a lot I think I am missing as far as plot is concerned.  Now, all things considered, was it worth the $25 I paid in the store?  Yeah, it probably was.  But I wouldn't want to force anyone this that has already gone through puberty to sit through.",1153785600,3,993,4.223404255319149
