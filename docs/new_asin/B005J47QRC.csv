8475349,4,B005J47QRC,"4 Stars for the film BUT 1 Star for Amazon Video version. Simply put, there are no subtitles. After calling Amazon, they confirmed that the two previous reviewers ordered as a DVD which came with subtitles. The movie itself is great, especially for those interested in Israeli films and the diversity of Israel. I am sure very few English speaking people could make heads or tails of this version. Truthfully, the vast majority of Israelis would be able to fully comprehend this movie. Yes, the main language is Hebrew, but there is also Russian and Ahmaric. Not just a few words throw in, but entire scenes. Fun to catch the occasional Yiddish and some Israeli borrowed Arabic terms, but without subtitles it is unwatchable for 99.999% of people on planet Earth. Why Amazon chose not to include subtitles, and simply brush it off as ""the video does not specify that subtitles are included"" is unacceptable. Yes, get the movie, but only in DVD format.
Amazon did offer to refund my money, however. I wanted to keep it as I had seen it and gotten the general plot. They gave me Film Movement's phone number so I could request that they add subtitles. That was a waste. They slso informed me they would work on getting subtitles and email me when and if they were available. I decided to get a refund and buy the more expensive DVD. I went back to edit my rant about this, only to see that it now clearly states ""with English subtitles"". So much for the email. Also, Netflix had this streaming for over 8 months with subtitles. Glad the issue was resolved, but of the numerous folks I spoke to only one showed the usual Amazon can do helpfulness.",1396051200,,1644,4.576271186440678
8475350,4,B005J47QRC,"First things first, I am a huge fan of Film Movement, which releases foreign and indie movies on DVD which otherwise would never find an audience here.

""Vasermil"" (2007 release from Israel; 95 min.) brings the story of three youths, growing up in the southern Israeli city of Be'er Sheva in the Negev desert. In a sense it provides a microcosm of Israel's society, which has seen significant changes with the massive immigration in the last 15-20 years from Russia and Africa. One of the boys hails from Ethiopian immigrants, another from Russian immigrants, and the last one is an Israeli native. All of them live in difficult family and economic circumstances, and their way to improve themselves, perhaps, lies in playing for the local high school soccer team, hoping to attrack the interest of soccer scouts. I don't want to give too much away from the plot, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out, although I will venture to say that this movie doesn't guarantee a Hollywood ""happy ending"" or ""all issues resolved"" when the movie concludes. Great performances from the three youths, in particular the Etheopian and Russian boys. I really enjoyed this movie from start to finish. There is a great scene in the early part of the movie when the Ethiopoan boy and one of his friends stare into a beautiful sunset, the boy says ""it's just like Africa"" and his friend responds ""you've never even been in Africa!"" Ha!

I am a little puzzled why Film Movement decided to release this movie now, almost 5 years after it came out originally, but I suppose better later than never. I spent some time in Isreal in late 2010, including in the Negev desert. Amazing what I saw there, cities built literally out of nowhere in the unforgiving desert. I would readily recommend a trip to Israel if you've never been there. That aside, if you are into good foreign and indie movies, I would strongly suggest you seek out this movie.",1336348800,4,1939,4.7

Israel is, this movie reminds us, something of a melting pot. We have three young male characters we follow through this story, and each is a different nationality. We have Sholmi (Nadir Eldad), who works as a pizza delivery boy for an extremely unpleasant man and who is also captain of his local soccer team. Then we have Dima (David Taplitzky), a Russian immigrant who works for some shady types dealing drugs. Finally there's Adiel (Adiel Zamro), a student who is either Ethiopian by birth or just of Ethiopian ancestry. One interesting side effect of this cast of characters is that the movie is in three different languages: Hebrew, Russian and Amharic.

The movie begins with a rather bored-looking Dima stealing the scooter Shlomi uses for doing deliveries. This appears to be just a random act and not targeted at Shlomi in particular. He then spends some time riding around his hometown as Shlomi has to explain to his unsympathetic, violent boss that the scooter was stolen. Dima eventually dumps the scooter where it's found by Adiel and a friend of his as they walk home from soccer practice. They aren't sure what to make of it, but certainly know what to do with the pizza they find inside the scooter's cargo box. Unfortunately, as they're enjoying their new-found tastiness, Shlomi and his brother find them, assume they're the ones who stole the scooter and beat five kinds of snot out of them.

We then spend some time following each of the three boys through their lives. Dima's home life, we learn, is very unhappy. His father is unemployed, verbally abusive and holds out dreams of moving to Germany. Dima himself seems fairly directionless, and skips school a lot. Adiel has a significantly better family life, and has a brother he dotes on. He's got dreams of playing soccer, but doesn't think they're realistic dreams. As for Shlomi, well, his family life is right between the other two and he clearly wants to play soccer professionally.

And soccer is, in fact, what winds up bringing the boys together, as all three end up on the same team. Dima initially is the towel boy, but quickly winds up being recruited to play goalie when the regular goalie is injured. He proves to be very good at this, and within a couple games, the three boys, who had all initially disliked and distrusted each other, are well on their way to becoming life-long friends. That is provided that the rest of the world doesn't get in the way...

I liked this movie. It was nice to see a film about Israel that has nothing to do with tensions between Jews and Muslims, but instead is about tensions between different groups of Jews. It was also very nice to see a film that really didn't have that much to do with religion and had nothing at all to do with terrorism. I was very interested in the three boys and their fates, especially Dima's. All the young actors do a great job in their roles and I liked seeing their stories develop and intertwine.

However I must complain about one thing, and that is the fact that the film doesn't so much end as it just kind of stops. We have a moment that was largely inevitable, I suppose, and then nothing but the closing credits. That was a little irksome, but that complaint aside this was a good, entertaining film.

== SHORT FEATURE ==

This month's short feature is a twenty minute documentary about African refuges living in Israel and attending a Hebrew language class. Yes, it's news to me that there's African refuges in Israel, but there you are. The movie mostly pays attention to a man named Kokou who is a refugee from Togo and seems to be very bitter about the way the Ministry of the Interior is treating him.

This was an interesting little ""slice of life"" film, but ultimately nothing really great. I think it could make for a much more interesting full-length documentary, however, and that's something I'd like to see. As it was, well, it was ok.",1328659200,2,3980,4.6500711237553345
