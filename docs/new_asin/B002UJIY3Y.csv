8381280,1,B002UJIY3Y,"i try to be supportive of black films & businesses, support my race, but this movie was lower than low budget. i knew that this was gonna be a low budget B-movie, but some of this was just too ridiculous. the plot was alright at first but then it got confussing at the end. ok, if you are a record producer with a million dollar worth of music tracks, why would you be living in the projects driving a 80's model blaser (not hooked up with rim & speakers). i normally don't like telling people of movie & just let them watch it for their selfs, but this was a waste of time & money. it's about a record producer who got killed & all of his recording artises are all suspects. they all start blaming each other, & arguing, as the story goes on you see how each of them had a reason for killing him, but one by one they start getting killed, they all are in this big building, you got a security guard walking around in the dark with flashlight of this supposivedly major recording studio. now i kept falling asleep before the end everytime, it got confussing because there were more than one killer dressed up in the mask & something about a cop being involved as well. the end didn't make any sense at all.
i wouldn't waste any money on this, i spent around $5 for it & i'm highly upset for spending that much.",1379376000,,1310,4.2023809523809526
