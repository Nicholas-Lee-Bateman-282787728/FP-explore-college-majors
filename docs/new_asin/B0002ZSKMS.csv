Salvador is my favorite. I was working in San Salvador around the time frame of the movie (a bomb went off just outside my hotel room the first night I was there). James Woods,who should have won as best actor at the Oscars, and James Belushi are excellent in the title roles.  Roger Ebert rates JFK as one of the 100 best films of all time. Kevin Costner is outstanding; my only problem with JFK is the movie runs 205 minutes. I have the same problem with Nixon: Anthony Hopkins, who was nominated for best actor at the Oscars but didn't win, is convincing as Nixon, but 212 minutes is just too much Nixon. Val Kilmer IS Jim Morrison. And the music in The Doors is great.
All the other films are worth viewing at least once, and they all look great on a HDTV. 4 1/2 stars.",1242259200,6,1494,5.72972972972973
2154292,3,B0002ZSKMS,"I'll keep this short and sweet, as most of you have already touched on this before me.  None of the 2 disc sets include their second disc.  That means collectors like me basically had to repurchase the DVDs if they wanted any supplemental material included with their fave flicks.  I found this to be a bit of a money waster, and basically an expensive way to purchase the Stone documentaries, that as far as I know, can only be found here.  I'd have rather just paid 20 bucks for them on a seperate DVD, however.",1186790400,7,513,4.368421052631579
2154293,4,B0002ZSKMS,"This filmmaking collection is almost perfect, but not quite superior to, the previous Oliver Stone collection that was released. All of his directorial efforts starting with Salvador are included, and they are packaged similar to the way television series dvd sets are packaged (like Grey's Anatomy and Lost), with two overlapping discs per side of the package. Platoon is the special edition that was released by MGM/UA many years back, it is not the most recent special edition. Salvador, Wall Street, and Talk Radio are all the single disc special editions that are available separately. Born On The Fourth of July is the remastered version that was released not too long ago (picture is vastly improved with more natural hues and tones). The Doors, JFK, Nixon, and Any Given Sunday are separately available as two-disc editions and only the first discs of each (basically only the movie) are available in this set. Heaven and Earth and U-Turn are the same as what is available separately, and finally Natural Born Killers is the RATED version of the film, not the Unrated released by Trimark. The picture is much better than the Trimark Unrated release of the film but it is missing up to three minutes of footage needed to achieve an R rating. The NBK disc does include deleted scenes, commentary, and a theatrical trailer. I'm not sure why Warner Bros doesn't release the Unrated version since it does with all of its other films (except for Eyes Wide Shut, I suppose) but whatever. The extra disc on this set includes Stone's recent documentaries Persona Non Grata and Looking For Fidel. It does not included Comandante which is still not available in this country (you can get a Region 2 copy on Amazon.co.uk but you'll need a region free player to play it). There is also a little blurb about Alexander included. Oh, and the documentary Oliver Stone's America is also included including the full version of his student film Last Year In Vietnam. So, all in all this is a great buy. If you really end up wanting the two-disc editions of some of the films after you watch them, you can always buy them later. If you buy this, Alexander (either or both versions), and his upcoming World Trade Center, you will own almost all of Oliver Stone's directorial efforts for a pretty cheap price all things considered. Enjoy!",1161734400,21,2323,4.81
2154294,5,B0002ZSKMS,Are you kidding me ???Where can you get 13 GREAT movies and EXTRAS for this price??  I cant believe people that find fault with a set containing so much for so little!!!!Each of these movies is highly entertaining in its own way. A diversified group of films you'll never find in a single collection!!!!I cant believe this doesnt cost$150 or more!!!,1159660800,11,349,4.721311475409836
2154295,2,B0002ZSKMS,"This DVD set consists of one outer and two inner Boxes, each has 4 glassy DVD case, 3 double, 1 single. DVDs are not indipendent in this set, so if you want to buy it used, beware of the condition of the box. some movies like ""THE DOORS"" and ""Nixon"" are originnaly two discs editions but only first discs are included in this dvd set and worse is, there is a word ""disc 1"" printed of them which indicates that these are the first DVDs of a 2 disc set and that makes you feel there is something crude about this box set! and there is something really crude!
the quality of boxes and print is low. outer box could easily be damaged or worn and it's very loose. it's not a good deal, specially at the price of 116 dollars!",1118620800,30,719,4.1063829787234045
2154296,5,B0002ZSKMS,"All great movies, but I couldn't help but notice that every time I try to eject the JFK Director's Cut DVD, the disc pops out of the DVD player and then makes an unexpected move back and to the left.",1112659200,17,199,4.0
2154297,4,B0002ZSKMS,"$116 for 12 movies is a gift. You shouldn't complain about second discs being excluded, because the special features are just a marketing tool. They're meant to dissuade people from downloading movies, and it doesn't stop them. No one questions that Oliver Stone is more of the best directors of our time. He's right up there with Martin Scorcese, Ron Howard and Robert Zemeckis. If you're familiar at all with Oliver Stone movies, then that should be what makes your decision. His films are meant to make a message to society. Heaven and Earth is an underrated movie that is very, very hard to find. As a matter of fact, I never saw it individually sold in any store. I wanted to see it for a long time, and was glad when I did finally see it. Talk Radio was more than a little bit disturbing, but it was brilliant at the same time. Natural Born Killers has been one of my favorites for years, as has Nixon, not so much JFK or Salvador but you're paying an average of $9.67 for each DVD, and that's a bargain.",1103932800,9,1010,4.377659574468085
2154298,4,B0002ZSKMS,"The Oliver Stone Collection (Redux) is the second time out that Warner has trundled this great director's wares on DVD. The first collection was limited to titles that Warner held the rights to. This time we get a comprehensive collection of the master's work; 14 films in all, representing Stone's brilliant work from virtually every studio in Hollywood - save Paramount. The set contains Stone's most prolific masterpieces (Platoon, Natural Born Killers, Born On The Fourth of July, Any Given Sunday), his most ridiculed and underrated set pieces (JFK, Nixon, Wall Street, The Doors) and his largely forgotten precursors to greatness (Salvador, Talk Radio) which, in hindsight, are great masterworks in their own right.

Synopses in brief:

Talk Radio: A hard-edged journey into the spiraling out of control life of a radio shock jock who is on the verge of a crying gag.

Salvador: A burned out freelance photographer's interest in journalism is rekindled amidst the civil unrest in war ravaged El Salvador.

Platoon: A troupe of soldiers enter the hellish nightmare that was Vietnam and lose their souls to the inner struggle that has no heroes or winners.

Wall Street: Martin and Charlie Sheen butt heads after the latter goes to work for unscrupulous corporate raider, Gordon Gecco (Michael Douglas). Heavily dated in its oh, so 80s subject matter.

Born On The Fourth Of July: A no-holds-barred, bare knuckled account of the folly and shame of an ungrateful country that befell returning Vietnam vets.

Natural Born Killers: A seething, scathing attack on the legal justice system and media hype that transforms the terrorizing debauchery of a couple of reprobates - Mickey and Mallory into `Robin Hood-like' vigilantes.

The Doors: The calamitous highs and debilitating lows of rock legend Jim Morrison get the robust treatment in this high octane rock-u-mentory that puts ""Rock Star"" to shame.

JFK: The stunning conspiracy theory saga that attempts to offer up alternative theories to the Warren Commission's report on President Kennedy's assassination. An eclectic, thrilling roller coaster of a movie with a slam bang finish!

Nixon: A rather straight-forward retelling of Nixon's highs and lows with Sir Anthony Hopkins doing his best to hide the fact that no one is quite like Tricky Dick but the man himself. Paul Sorvino is hauntingly on point as Henry Kissenger and Joan Allen gives a most intelligent read of first lady, Pat.

Any Given Sunday: A hard-edged look at the world of professional sports and how corruption, greed and the competitive spirit collide. Cameron Diaz and Al Pacino stage some rough-house politics to will a ferocious team out of its losing streak. Hot stuff!

This collection gives you a solid batch of transfers; the one disappointment remaining ""Born On The Fourth of July"" which still has not been anamorphically enhanced for widescreen televisions. Otherwise, picture quality throughout is superb. Colors are rich and vibrant. ""Wall Street"" exhibits the most dated picture quality of the lot. Some pixelization is evident on both ""Nixon"" and ""Talk Radio."" ""Platoon"" and ""JFK"" exhibit a flawless and impeccably balanced transfer quality with very clean, reference quality whites and deep, rich solid blacks. The audio on most films is pristine. Again, the earlier films in the collection (from Salvador to Wall Street) have a more tinny treble and hollow sounding bass, but this is to be expected. Special features vary according to each disc. All come with at least an audio commentary provided by Stone. There's also a host of extra features on Stone himself, his life and life's work, as well as a preview of his latest project, ""Alexander."" For the price this box set is an absolute must for any collector!",1098230400,58,3755,5.137704918032787
2154299,5,B0002ZSKMS,Every single film in this collection will not disappoint.  Oliver Stone exposes the evil side of humans in a way that will make you think deeply - why do we hurt each other?  Why are we sometimes so evil and partake in so much greed?  Why not be peaceful.,1389052800,,255,4.163265306122449
2154300,3,B0002ZSKMS,"This collection contains 12 Oliver Stone films. All of these films are worth watching. Oliver Stone's America (2001 Video Documentary) is also included on its own disc. The bonus disc contains, ""On the Set of Alexander"", ""Looking for Fidel"", and ""Persona Non Grata"". There is no equivalent Stone Blu-ray collection that is this massive though some of these films have stand-alone Blu-ray releases. My favorites are Wall Street, Platoon and Natural Born Killers. The major downside is that many of these films got 2-disc DVD releases but the bonus disc from that release has not been included in this particular collection. There is some light extras provided for each film but this set works as a value pack only (all films come with at least an audio commentary provided by Oliver Stone). These are 4 star films in a 3 star package. This collection has managed to hold its value.",1379894400,,880,4.873333333333333

2154302,5,B0002ZSKMS,"Well, what can I say about the ULTIMATE OLIVER STONE COLLECTION? It is an absolutely amazing box set with 12 wonderful films and some of the most influential of the 20th century! Love him or hate him, Oliver Stone's Films make you think. He is an artist of the highest magnitude. A brilliant poet and visionary whom creates unforgettable images and writes with a flair not
common in most films. He has guts and is unafraid to tackle controversial subjects that challenge the status quo. And you will find most of them here, I just wish the box set could be updated to include Oliver's films from the 21st century, ALEXANDER, WORLD TRADE CENTER, W., SOUTH OF THE BORDER, WALL STREET: MONEY NEVER SLEEPS, and SAVAGES. That will be the ULTIMATE, ULTIMATE OLIVER STONE COLLECTION!
However, with this 4 Disc Box Set Edition you will get 12 beautiful Oliver Stone Directed films: PLATOON, WALL STREET, SALVADOR, TALK RADIO, BORN ON THE 4TH OF JULY, THE DOORS, JFK, HEAVEN & EARTH, NATURAL BORN KILLERS, NIXON, U-TURN, ANY GIVEN SUNDAY (Director's Cut), plus 2 Oliver Stone Directed For HBO Documentaries LOOKING FOR FIDEL, PERSONA NON GRATA, plus a behind the scenes special taking a look at Oliver Stone's newest film (New when this box set was released) ON THE SET OF ""ALEXANDER"". Finally a fascinating Documentary / Interview directed by Oliver Stone's biographer Charles Kiselyak titled ""OLIVER STONE'S AMERICA"".

I simply cannot reccomend this box set enough, it is a must own for any serious Film collector or Film Lover.
Oliver's powerful, provocative, explosive and cotroversial masterpiece JFK, a film that at the time of it's release
in December of 1991 made audiences across America furious about how much we do not know about the assassination of 35th president of the United States John Fitzgerald Kennedy. JFK led to congress in 1992 creating the ""Assassination Records
Review Board"", which looked at the unreleased files of the C.I.A., the F.B.I. and other agancies pretaining to the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and decided which ones could be released to the public.
JFK is a film that Stone has called a ""counter-myth"" as opposed to the complete myth of the warren report. JFK is the story
of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison whom in 1966 began his own investigation into JFK's murder, which led to the
only trial and public prosecution of a conspirator in JFK's death. Critics and audiences across the globe Loved the film which was also nominated for several Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director for Stone and Best Screenplay. Tommy Lee Jones won an oscar for his role as New Orleans buisnessman Clay Shaw. JFK has a stellar, all-star cast with Kevin Costner,
Sissy Spacek, Joe Pesci, Kevin Bacon, Tommy Lee Jones, Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald.

The box set also contains Stone's Vietnam Trilogy featuring PLATOON, a film which won The Academy Award for Best Picture  (1986)and Best Original Screenplay (Stone). Also BORN ON THE 4TH OF JULY starring Tom Cruise in probably the best performance of his career playing a young man in love with his country who goes to fight in Vietnam. There he is shot and paralyzed from the waist down and confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. He returns to America only to find the country and it's
people are vastly different than he remembered. He then takes a journey that will make him rise as a voice of peace and a champion against a war he now sees fo what it truly is, a lie.
Finally in the trilogy is Stone's masterpiece, HEAVEN & EARTH about a young Vietnam girl and her journey to America and finally back home to Vietnam.

Also, again some of the Best and Defining Films of the 20TH Century, NIXON, NATURAL BORN KILLERS, U-TURN, THE DOORS,
TALK RADIO, SALVADOR, ANY GIVEN SUNDAY, WALL STREET and more complete a box set from one of the greatest filmmakers
of all time, 3 Time Academey Award Winner Oliver Stone. A+",1352246400,2,3966,4.802342606149341
