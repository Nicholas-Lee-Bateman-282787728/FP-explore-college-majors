8070936,1,B000A0C70G,"Don't buy anything from this series. Though it seems innocent enough, it was created by people who were members of the family international/children of god/the family of love...a cult with a background in child abuse and religious prostitution and much more nastiness. Anything created out of the belief system of this group is not something you'd want to expose your kids to. Heres something about the group: [...]",1457222400,,415,5.117647058823529
8070937,1,B000A0C70G,"This product is directly linked to the cult THE FAMILY INTERNATIONAL / THE CHILDREN OF GOD, known as the sex cult, who for years preached sex with children and who promoted bizarre religious doctrines. The proceeds of this CHERUB WINGS, linked with Sunny Side Up productions and Aurora Productions go directly to support cult leaders. The producers of Cherub Wings have no legal association with the cult purposely so that they can continue to profit without any legations and connections to past and present crimes.",1456704000,,516,5.08235294117647
8070938,1,B000A0C70G,"These products are made by the group formerly known as the Children of God and later The Family international. Due to a lot of bad press they have separated their branding from the cult but it is still run by members who funnel this money straight to their leader Karen Zerby's pockets. The children from TFI have suffered terrible abuse in their childhood including sexual, physical and mental abuse all which is well documented. Some survivors of  the cult are well known: River Phoenix, Joaquin Phoenix, Rose McGowen. Julianna Buhring (Guiness world record holder as the first woman to circumnavigate the work on a bicycle), Taylor Stevens. Some great books you can read about them are Not without my Sister, and The Innocent.
I recommend that you do not buy this product it supports well documented pedophiles.",1456704000,,814,4.9416058394160585

8070940,5,B000A0C70G,"""Dad, the kids at school were mocking me today because I'm a Christian.""

It's not easy to live in today's world and still hold to Christian standards. At the risk of sounding like a wimp, I'll confess that I am very weak in the face of peer pressure, and I know that it's much harder still for a child or young person at school.

""Bold and Brave"" deals with the issue of standing up for Jesus in a hostile world, and ... it's fun while it's doing it!

I haven't seen the whole Cherub Wings series, but it seems to be aiming at helping youngsters to live their faith. It is strongly Christian in content, but not in a way that would be offensive to non-Christians. Add that to the fun way that the messages are presented, and the result is something that, as a Christian parent, I really appreciate.

It appears to be non-denominational, and doesn't seem to get into issues of controversy between one denomination and another. My kids like it, and I recommend it.",1147046400,,963,4.423728813559322
