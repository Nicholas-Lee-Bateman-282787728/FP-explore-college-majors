The Care Bears voices are probably very soothing for children to listen to, but I don't talk baby talk to my grand kids, so I find some of the voices a little more like a whine and somewhat irritating. I give the content and B plus for positive behavior, but the video quality quality is just not up to par. With all the new technology available, I would think the sound and special effects would be better in these videos. It's hard to hold a toddler's attention with such a basic video, but I do love the idea behind the lessons!",1470096000,,619,4.299145299145299
