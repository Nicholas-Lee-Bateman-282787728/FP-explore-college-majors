8169547,5,B000MKXELK,"My daughter is a huge Hello Kitty fan and she loves this even more with all the other characters in it besides Hello Kitty. She sits there and watches it for the entire movie. I also find it adorable and can even sit and watch it with my daughter. Overall, it was a great buy!",1359590400,,276,4.036363636363636
8169548,5,B000MKXELK,"I bought some Stump Village DVDs for my 4 year old niece, and she loves them! She watches them all the time with her plush Hello Kitties, and tries to sing the song. It is perfect for her sense of humor and attention span. The stories are short and silly, the humor is very slapstick, and even if you're not paying attention to what's going on, it's so cute you'll smile anyway. The clay-mation is so precious (and weird), I had a blast watching it with her!",1357862400,2,458,4.275862068965517
8169549,5,B000MKXELK,"Please disregard that first negative review. (It has one wondering if they woke up on the wrong side of the bed that day?!) For all you claymation fans out there, it makes for a more special viewing. With computer animation having overtaken many of the cartoons I grew up watching and cherishing as a kid, this was a breathe of fresh air.  I appreciated the fact it WAS narrated. The first viewing was in the car dvd and I didn't see it. I was initially disappointed until I actually viewed it.  It keeps both my 2 and 5 year girls engaged. They love the music and are smitten with the innocence of it all. They have been singing and dancing the song on it. For all you Miffy fans, it's very reminiscent of that show. I actually snagged this one up in Marshalls. I imagine not easy to find. I give it 5 stars.",1312588800,6,809,4.246753246753247
8169550,1,B000MKXELK,"The third in a series of the strangest ""Children's Programming"" I have seen in quite awhile.  I have no idea who thought this was a good idea to market to little kids.  The characters all hurt each other, launch each other into buildings, or hit each other with mallets while a voice over says ""Oh no, My Melody has an owwie now.""  It is incredibly disturbing.  The characters don't talk at all, just the eerie saccharine voice over.  Skip this one, head for Hello Kitty's FurryTale Theater if you are looking for good Hello Kitty!",1262908800,3,531,4.5473684210526315
