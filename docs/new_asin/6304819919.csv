935589,5,6304819919,"Although quite a rare film to get a hold of now & out of print, this is one of Ralph Fiennes early successes on the big screen. Although playing our GREAT hero Lawrence completely differently to Peter O'Toole, I think Ralph does a wonderful job of portraying Lawrence's personality (assuming all that we read is true of this iconic legend?)

The story here is about what happened after the defeat of the Turks in Transjordan and what the Ottoman Empire was then. How the great expanse of this area was split up, why it was split up & who were involved in the [fatal?] decision making behind creating the countries that exist in the Middle East today. It will probably help you understand the present conflicts out there and may get you to question whether what happened was in the true interests of those living there? Namely Iraq, Iran, Syria, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon & Saudi Arabia.

As Ralph discovers half way through the film it's all about power, money & of course Oil.

Not as long as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" it is worth its weight in gold as it compliments the original film.",1185062400,8,1080,4.585492227979275
935590,5,6304819919,"Picking up where ""Lawrence of Arabia"" left off, this film focuses on the political maneuverings among the French, English, and Americans following World War I, as they gather in Paris to divide up the world according to their colonial interests. T. E. Lawrence and the Arab prince Faisal, who fought together against the Turks during the war, attempt to preserve the new-won independence for the Arabs, but they are out-maneuvered at nearly every turn by the British, who with the help of the French, have plans to fold much of Arabia into the Empire.

Since we know from the start that Lawrence fails in his efforts, the film becomes a character study of a man without the political leverage to gain his objectives, while deeply conflicted by a personal history that makes his efforts seem desperate and painful. Meanwhile, those pitted against him are quick to show their scorn, using his illegitimate birth and his humble origins in an attempt to humiliate and intimidate him. In response, Lawrence employs his cutting wit, his intelligence, and a kind of reckless bravado to hold his own against them until circumstances and exhaustion finally wear him down.

Compared to Peter O'Toole's performance in ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" Ralph Fiennes gives us a less glamorized portrayal of the man who seems driven by both over-confidence and self-doubt. The giggly grin during moments of pressure reveals a barely concealed uncertainty, even when he is playing hardball with his adversaries. It's clear that he is most at ease with his only compatriot, Faisal, whom he loves, while at the same time using him like a pawn in a game he seems to be playing for his own ends. It's a wonderfully complex performance set against a key moment in European and Middle East history with ramifications that fill the news today, almost 90 years later.",1171929600,15,1833,4.9480519480519485
935591,4,6304819919,"The sequel to David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" with Ralph Fiennes reprising Peter O'Toole's role as the protagonist. A good portrait of the aftermath of WWI and the diplomatic wrangling of the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. France and Great Britain decide how to divvy up the Near East after the demise of the Ottoman Empire. Notable figures include Gertrude Bell, Winston Chrurchill, and Woodrow Wilson.",1164326400,4,406,5.166666666666667
935592,4,6304819919,"Being a student of TE Lawrence, I particularly enjoyed this movie about the Paris Peace Conference post WW I British-French handling of Arabia.  Ralph Fiennes was wonderful in the role of Lawrence.  His physical stance, body language, facial expressions and voice were as history describes TEL.  This movie was subtle, sets and costumes historically accurate and famous figures very well cast.  It would be of interest to history lovers, specifically of this era, even who knew nothing about the specific subject.  However, knowing the facts probably does add to the appreciation of the movie.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in TE Lawrence and/or the history of Arabia and the Middle East.",1121472000,36,711,5.139130434782609
935593,4,6304819919,"Spoiler alert.
I just finished reading the chapter about the Arab Revolt in the book ""Paris 1919,"" which details the events of the Paris Peace talks after the end of the Great War. There is nothing in that chapter about this letter documenting a British promise of Arab independence, which Lawrence was to have released to the press. Was that true? I would like to know.",1083801600,5,370,4.621212121212121
935594,5,6304819919,"Follows up on where ""Lawrence of Arabia"" left off. It's 1919, WWI has ended. Lawrence and Feisel travel to the Paris Peace Conference in hopes of gaining independence for the Arabs but become entangled in diplomacy and political intrigue.
This film was made for television so don't expect a majestic, wide-screen David Lean production. But what is here is very well done indeed and centers on the man behind the legend and touches on the psychological angst that drove him.
Very well written and acted. Cast includes: Ralph Fiennes as Lawrence and Siddig El Fadil as Feisal. Highly recommended.",1076889600,56,594,5.01010101010101
935595,5,6304819919,"If all we had of T.E. Lawrence were David Lean's epic ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" we'd have fodder for generations of romantics, but despite its sumptuousness it relies heavily on the previous mythmaking of Lowell Thomas, and Lawrence's own dissembling in ""Seven Pillars of Wisdom.""  ""A Dangerous Man,"" offers a corrective without destroying the myth, by giving us a deeper portrait of Lawrence, and a more factual take on his desert adventures.
World War One found its raison d'etre only after the war was declared.  The assassination of a Serbian Archduke was the catalyst, but the war itself became a grab for resources, and in the mid-east, a continuation of the Great Game the superpowers had been playing for years.  Rather than restricting the game to Afghanistan though, the entire region opened up for a land-grab of huge proportions, and the ill-fated peace conference in Versailles became the ultimate playing field.  Lloyd George and Clemenceau represented ""old Europe's"" wheeling, dealing, and chicanery; while Woodrow Wilson represented the somewhat bumbling, idealistic, and ridiculed ideals of American self-determination as an unrealistic alternative to a world steeped in colonization.  Lawrence and his Prince Feisal were the wild cards, and they played their cards like world-class sharks.
""A Dangerous Man,"" is a top-notch movie, intelligently written, flawlessly directed, and superbly acted.  It's one of the few celluloid histories that find fact more interesting than fiction, and it also serves as an interesting primer to recent events.
My recommendation is unqualified; this is a movie worth seeing and talking about.",1054512000,96,1639,5.433070866141732
935596,4,6304819919,"This movie does not have the sweeping cinematography that ""Lawrence of Arabia"" had, but this is still a good movie.  The viewer will see what happened behind closed doors after Lawrence returned to Europe in an attempt to further the Arab independence cause.
Fiennes is a great choice for T.E. Lawrence.  His expressions speak volumes of all the things running through Lawrence's head as he tried to fight the agenda of France and Great Britain.  In his interaction with his Arab counterpart, you see that he does not always share what he is thinking and that his fame is beginning to cause some trouble for him.
Although a fine movie, you really need to know a bit about this time and the events to really understand it all.  Mentioned in the movies is Lawrence's book ""Seven Pillars of Wisdom,"" which would be helpful.
I would recommend watching this movie.",1024358400,22,859,4.74496644295302
935597,1,6304819919,"There is no way anyone can compare this movie to the superb David Lean  version, Lawrence of Arabia. If you're looking for the greatest film of all  time, Lawrence of Arabia is it! It gives the viewer insight into Lawrence's  personality as well as the history of the time. Ralph Fiennes is not a bad  actor, but he has a tendency, both in this movie and in The English  Patient, to immitate Peter O'Toole! By the way, I suggest you watch  Lawrence of Arabia first and then The English Patient in order to see how  much the David Lean epic has influenced modern movies. The English Patient  is a rip-off of Lawrence of Arabia....the only thing that is original is  the love story!",968198400,9,680,4.463414634146342

7878514,3,6304819919,"This is the story of Lawrence after the war.

The plot is based upon actual events -- Lawrence trying to help the Arabs gain their independence in 1920 from England and France at the Paris Peace Conference.

Where Lawrence of Arabia (with Peter O'Toole) had great characters and great dialog, this film has none of that.

The plot meanders through the Paris Peace Conference and portrays Lawrence (who was very intelligent and a shrewd strategist) continually being out maneuvered by politicians -- which was historically true -- and the luster of his fame was gone.

The question remains: Why the film's title ""A Dangerous Man""?  Lawrence was a dangerous man during the First World War, but afterwards he was politically impotent.  The title should have been: A Study In Frustration.",1373155200,,784,4.992307692307692
7878515,1,6304819919,"this thing was awful! it was Ralph Fiennes playing Peter Otoole, playing T.E.Lawrence and it all fails miserably! Fiennes tries to make use of all Otoole's mannerisms, his breathlessness and syntax. Fiennes doesn't have an original take on any of it and we see a flimsy, half baked attempt to mirror the same exact moves and facial expressions of Otoole. he's like Howie Mandel in ""little monsters"" pretending to be Michael Keaton in ""beatlejuice"",,,,Ralph Fiennes is just another Howie Mandel, oh god what a steaming pile of camel dung!!",1366934400,,538,5.056179775280899

7878518,5,6304819919,"Introduction: If you're looking for a film filled with vast, breathtaking landscapes, exotic customs and wardrobe and a mesmerizing soundtrack rivaling that of the classic `Lawrence of Arabia' then this is not the film for you. On the other hand if the enigmatic figure of T.E. Lawrence (AKA: Lawrence of Arabia) stirred something within you leaving you craving a deeper understanding of the man behind the myth and the motives and ideals driving him to challenge his national and cultural interests in pursuit of a more universal justice then this is definitely the film for you!

Synopsis: In the film `A Dangerous Man' starring Ralph Fiennes in the role of legendary Lawrence we take up his saga shortly after the hot, sweltering deserts of Arabia have been left far behind and the sound of artillery and clashing swords are but a disquieting memory. Unfortunately the war rages on now within the enclosed confines of stately European boardrooms where England and France, along with other interested parties, meet and plan on just how to divide up the Middle East to suit their own national interests.

Once again Lawrence continues to be the major obstacle to the Occidental Worlds plans as he continues his fight to establish an ""Arabia for the Arabs."" Yes the method of battle has changed; weapons have been replaced by words and courage by diplomacy, but the battle is just as fierce nonetheless. On the behalf of the Arab people Lawrence battles on and proves to be just as determined, persuasive and dangerous as he ever was in the desert sand. Exactly what can one man, even a man such as T.E. Lawrence accomplish against the greed of nations without a conscience?

Critique: Where `Lawrence of Arabia' was an epic that deservedly attracted a vast audience of admirers, `A Dangerous Man' is more of a footnote that will attract a much smaller audience who found an unexplainable kinship with Lawrence. Ralph Fiennes is the perfect choice to play the part of this incredibly gifted and complex individual, matching the intensity and overpowering obsession of Lawrence as he was first portrayed by the incomparable Peter O'Toole. The psychological battle fought both within the European corridors of power and inside the mind of Lawrence is profound and unforgettable. My recommendation, see this film.

Postscript: Have you ever wondered why there continues to be such animosity between the Occidental and Arab world? This film will surely shed a little light on the subject.",1290211200,5,2484,5.021844660194175

I made screen-caps of it so I can use the hotty pics of Ralph Fiennes as a slide show as my screen saver and sit at work pretending to be hard at work doing whatever it is I'm supposed to be doing while what I'm really getting up to is watching my number one celebrity crush dressed up like some kind of sheik and then sometimes dressed up like what appears to be a WWI era British soldier of some type.
Whatever. It's better then what I had before which was a slide-show of my sister's newest litter of newborn Pug puppies in some sort of backyard pool with a Disney Tinkerbell motif which always seemed to depress me to no end. My god, Pugs are even ugly at birth.",1229904000,,715,4.114285714285714
