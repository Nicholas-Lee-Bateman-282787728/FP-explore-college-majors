2052047,5,B00020HAWY,"I absoultly love this show.  I am going to be confused on what to replace my favorite show with after this one ends.  It is sad to see this show is ending.
The rating below me(Viewer from New York)actually mad me laugh.  If this person doesn't like the show, then why does he/she bother to leave an ""essay"" on the why he/she thinks the show sucks.  Personally, this person doesn't have a sense of humor, a passion for anything, and no life.  These actors are extremely talented people and this viewer is just jealous that they make so much from this show.  They were paid so much an episode because they were awesome.  In my opinion, I think that his/her comment is false. He/she was just pulling false facts out of their ass and then using them to raise their intellect.  Cute, but nice try.  These people will be famous till the day they die and it is because of this show.",1083110400,11,875,4.351851851851852
2052048,5,B00020HAWY,"Hey People!  This is a time and space to review the product, have you all had advance screenings or something???  I agree that the finale will most definitely garner the 5-Stars I'm prematurely assigning to it...I just haven't seen it yet.
  It's hard to believe it'll all be over isn't it?  We had that 30 Minutes a week for 10 Years and just like that...it's DVD History.  What a show though, damn.  I've laughed for years.",1082419200,5,425,4.5131578947368425
2052049,5,B00020HAWY,"I've been a Friends fan since Day One, and man, what an amazing ten years. This DVD is a must-have for every fan. I remember the first time I saw Jennifer Aniston on TV, she was like 25 during the first season, and just like every guy in America, I fell in love with her and she made me melt like Velveeta. I had followed her career since then, but she will forever be Rachel. Speaking of Rachel, what a classic hairdo that was. I loved it! If this disc will have the pilot and music video, then it is a great value. By the way my favorite episode of all time is a season one episode, the one where Rachel has to return the ring and it got lost and she was freaking out, ""And now I'm going to have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder!"" This show is truly an all time classic and I'm glad to have been a devoted watcher for the last 10 years.",1082073600,6,873,3.965909090909091
2052050,5,B00020HAWY,Includes the 2-hour finale along with the pilot and bonus features!!!  How could you not want it?!  Re-experience the beginning and ending of Friends with this DVD.  (...)  And this is the ONLY DVD that will have the finale on it!  It's this or nothing.,1081987200,7,253,4.533333333333333
2052051,5,B00020HAWY,"This DVD is the biggest marketing action I've ever seen : Warner has decided to release the Friends Series Finale onto DVD, just 5 days after its airing on NBC !
But it's not because it's to make money that it's not good !! ;-). Indeed, every Friends Fan will want to own this Exclusive Limited Edition of the #1 comedy of the 90s, to watch it again and again ! Because, first of all, it's a collector item, that every real Friends fan should have, and second of all, because, it seems that Warner has decided to slow down the releases of the Compelte Seasons on DVD, according to some sources, and as a matter of fact, as already 2 seasons have been released so far in 2004 (the 6th and the 7th season), only one left could come out this year (the 8th) rather between September and December 2004. So, this would mean that the deluxe 4-Dsic set of The Complete Tenth Season wouldn't be released until 2005 ! So, this Limited Edition DVD will enable the fans to wait until the release of the entire season !
But, let's go back to the ""collector item"" thing if you doubt to buy this DVD... Collector because of :
- The packaging which does very collector-ish
- The number of DVDs produced (available for a limited time only !)
- And last but not least great bonus features ! Here's what this Special DVD is due to offer :
. The 2 parts Series Finale, including [Never]-[Before]-[Seen]-[Footage]
. The Series Pilot, also including [Never]-[Before]-[Broadcasted]-[Moments] (which are included on The Complete First Season DVD)
. ""I'll Be There For You"" Music Video featuring the Rembrandts
. ""Phoebe Battles the Pink Robots"" Music Video, featuring the Flaming Lips and directed by Kevin Bright
. A montage of the opening credits, which shows the progression of the series through the opening theme song from each season.
That's right : all that on only one DVD, for such a cheap prize ! A Must-Have DVD I tell you !(...)
And, what about what happens in the Series Finale ? Well, nothing is really sure yet and anyway, I won't reveal it here if some of you haven't seen the 10th season yet. Let's just say that Monica and Chandler finally see their dream to have a baby come true and that Ross and Rachel must finally end up together again.... Anyway, as the executive producers swore it : ""The show will end with an happy destiny for each friend."" That's all we want after all for our best buddies, what they deserve the best.",1081900800,26,2422,4.494331065759638

2052082,1,B00020HAWY,"We bought this soon after seeing the finale on TV. I had hoped the DVD would include the great retrospective full of clips and interviews (""The One with All the Other Ones"") which preceded the finale. It didn't. So what does it include? The pilot episode, the music video of the theme song, and a collection of opening titles over the years. Not worth whatever I paid for it. And it's not like the last Friends episode is anywhere near the best anyway (same with Seinfeld). Obviously this was just a rush job to capitalize on all the warm fuzzies right after the show ended. In time, more than one boxed set of the entire run has come out, so thankfully no one need fall for this now.",1254960000,,684,4.3515625

2052095,2,B00020HAWY,"When I purchased this DVD, I was so excited thinking that it will came with a special edition on the last episode of Friends.  Unfortunately, it came with the same final episode from Season 10, so I was watching the same episode twice.  I didn't find anything special on that DVD.  It came with the final episode with a different ending but I didn't see something really different...",1143331200,6,383,4.602941176470588
2052096,4,B00020HAWY,"Cons:

Both episodes appear in season packages, and the main reason you would have to buy this DVD is because you want to watch the extended version of the finale. Besides, it's just a waste of time to watch the intro videos of the 10 seasons...like 7 minutes of the same, and the music video ""I'll Be There For You"" just sucks!.

Pros:

However, I own this DVD because the 10th season still hasn't been released in my country, and the extended edition of the finale has lots of really funny parts that don't appear in the broadcasted edition, and it's very funny. Plus, you can watch also the 1st Friends episode ever, which is so, so funny, I think it's one of my favorites so far (I already own 4 complete seasons).

Now, to end with this:

WHY SOULD I BUY THIS?: Because you want to see the ending and you don't own the 10th season. Because you want to watch the extended version of the finale, which has about 3 minutes with extra scenes (they're so funny). Because you want to watch the first episode, which is very good. Because you're just a collector who owns every single ""Friends"" item there is.

WHY SOULDN'T I BUY THIS: Because you own the 1st and 10th season. Because you don't care about the 3 extra minutes in the extended version of the finale. Because the 3 episodes it includes don't worth the money. Because it's boring to watch the intro videos and the music video.

======

I really like this DVD and I gave it 4 stars because of the extended finale and the first episode. I didn't give it 5 stars because it doesn't include almost any interesting bonus features.

Now I just told you the pros and cons I could find, you make the decision. Bye.",1141257600,42,1666,4.383116883116883
2052097,1,B00020HAWY,"Warner television should have discontinue this title after releasing Season 10 which they didn't. although this Item had been in sale for a long period on amazon.com, but buying this even for 6 dollars is totallt waste of money cause all the stuff are available on season 10!

It could be worth if it was a real limited or collectors ediotion, packed with some extra stuff such as slip cover, collectible booklet, journal or something like that. but it was so far not a limited edition though. It had even no insert card! I can see this brilliant LIMITED EDITION!

2052098,3,B00020HAWY,"Friends is a truly great TV series. Few others have lasted so long and stayed so good. However, when looking at this particular DVD, I wonder why it was released? The simple fact is, there's no point to buy a DVD of 3 episodes, all of which are out on Boxsets for reasonable prices. Sure, this is budget, but when it comes right down to it, even the ~$10 (with shipping included) is not worth it. Do yourself a favor, and unless you're a serious collector who wants this in addition, just buy the 10th season boxset.",1133481600,3,516,4.329896907216495
2052099,2,B00020HAWY,"I love ""Friends.""  I love them all.  However, I'm not really satisfied with the ending of their story.

It seems that they end it up because they have to:  Rachel and Ross get together; Monica and Chandler finally have their babies...etc.  Those are too predictable!

I always expect something new and impressive, which will make the whole story unforgettable -- but, I don't see that in the finale.  Disappointing. That's why I didn't buy this DVD.

If you feel the similar way as I do, then don't buy it.  But if you are really a Friends fan so much crazy about collecting every ""Friends"" DVD, well, it's still a good one to think about.  Anyway, it's another New York City fairy tell in the 21st century.",1129680000,,707,4.5396825396825395

2052108,3,B00020HAWY,"This show is funny and stupid, gets boring sometimes, also has romantic moments. Overall it is a comedy about six friends trying to cope with life. The six of them are extremely dull, unintelligent, promiscuous, superficial and cute. The women are slutty and the men are stupid. You would think that in the period of ten years they will mature into adults but they are the same way at 35 as they were at 25 and possibly at 15. Overall it is a laid back comedy that relaxes the mind, but this is not an example of high moral standards, digmity and respect for one's self and others. In the entire series Rachel, Monica and Phoebe slept with about 50 men each. Ross, Chandler and Joey ran after every skirt and enjoyed the stupid pranks kids pulled in junior high.",1121385600,,762,4.45

2052112,5,B00020HAWY,"I loved this show. I watched it from the very beginning episode to the very last episode. I was 14 when this show came out so some of the raw humor that was used was over my head, but I still found the show to be great. As I got older I felt like I was ""growing up"" with the members of the cast. I could relate to all of them in some way. Rachel and her spoiled ways, Ross and his sensitive, witty attitute, Monica being the neat freak, Chandler using humor as a defense mechanism, Phoebe and her ability to make anything funny, and Joey and his loveable nature.

2052113,5,B00020HAWY,"I LOVED the end of friends. I mean alright, it wasn't as exciting as everyone was expecting it to be. But would it have been satisfying if it was? The way Friends ended shows us that Friends will never end, it keeps going on. The last episode was just our last peek at Monica, Chandler, Ross, Rachel, Phoebe, Joey and even Mike's lives- which continue. And the things that most viewers were waiting for finally happened- Ross and Rachel got back together, Monica and Chandler got their babies, Phoebe found her true love and Joey.... well, Joey went on being Joey. We wouldn't like him any other way.

It was a very clever ending- one that made us all cry, but made us laugh. The last scene with the keys for the apartment being left on the counter was bittersweet, leaving us torn but satisfied with how the whole thing had ended. All of us will remember friends- no one's ever going to forget it. Each of us will cherish a certain character in our hearts and love the others, and remember them- each of us will carry hundreds of memories, both happy and sad ones, and use them to relate to our own lives. And when we're stepping out onto a runway, perhaps after returning from vacation, or arriving to a destination on a business trip, we will never hesitate to remember that line- ""I got off the Plane.""",1100304000,11,1306,4.441666666666666

But then to tack on the same music video and pilot that is available on Season 1's DVD, and to offer a montage of opening credits is somewhat disappointing.  The finale could have included some inkling of a ""goodbye"": promos, a cast interview, the ""ten years"" special that aired on NBC? Perhaps on the season 10 DVD we can look forward to such things.

However, this is a great episode. Having watched this show for 10 years, I felt it takes each of the character's stories full circle. All the relationships are resolved, the children born. Everything ending on a bittersweet, yet complete note.",1099440000,5,753,4.681818181818182

2052118,5,B00020HAWY,"When we're going to think about the Friends' finale on a personal level, I think the episode really delivers because Oh God I bawled like a baby when I first watched this episode. Understated and low key but deeply emotional and very classy. I think it was the perfect exit especially the last few minutes when they're all together. There's no way true fans of the show wouldn't be satisfied because it's the perfect closure.

But for the detractors of the show who I assume only look at the episode on the comedy perspective would be underwhelmed because this is not the funniest episode ever. Most of the comedy was provided by Kudrow which until the very end is in high form. The strength of the show has always been the relationship of the six friends that made people really care for these characters. If all you think about after watching this episode is that it's not funny enough then maybe you are just really not a fan of the show. To paraphrase the creators this episode was written for the fans of the show.

The disc has practically no substantial special feature at all. I mean how about a documentary of the finale, interviews with cast and creators, behind the scenes, commentary? I just hope Season 10 Dvd will have those things and I hope the cast do a commentary for the final episode.

Buy it as a souvenir, I mean 10 dollars, come on! This is a piece of history. This large finale event would probably never happen again based on the current shows still airing (ELR? Don't think so, ER? Over! CSI? Meh! Simpsons? Probably but no). If you don't really want to shell out 10 dollars then wait for the Season 10 Dvd.

For all the people who grumble about the series finale not being up to snuff; well, forget you.  It is impossible to meet the demands and expectations of every single nit-picking fan around the world.  Inevitably, no matter what the writers penned for the final episode, some fans would eat it up like sweet apple pie while others looked down their noses at it as though something disgusting on the soles of their shoes.

I, as a fan of the show for ten faithful years, accepted the show and the series finale for what it was and have moved on with my life.  One cannot expect a show that has stood on the mountaintop for so many years to remain there for the series finale.  It was a proper end to a show that has given us more than enough memories to last a lifetime.  Even when the writers gave most fans (note how I didn't say ALL fans) what they wanted in the end - Ross and Rachel coming together; Chandler and Monica parenting twins - it still was not enough for some of the fan base.

Given the circumstances, the series finale was the culmination of ten years of great work on the show.  It bowed out gracefully, and didn't try to ""jump the shark"" with viewers.

Long live ""Friends.""  Long live the characters of Chandler, Joey, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel, Ross, and all the other wonderful actors and actresses who graced us with their ability to make us laugh, cry . . . then laugh and cry some more.",1096070400,7,1719,4.3742138364779874

The ending is anything but suprising. But the charm here lies in the acting. Jennifer Aniston and David Schimmer put up such a bittersweet act that makes me wanna cry and remember the time when we first knew of Ross' infatuation with Rachel since high school. Finally there's some closure.
Elsewhere, we see Phobe married to a sweet Mike while Monica and Chandler receive a bundle of joy with a pair of adopted twins which signify another golden moment in the show. Even Matt Le Blanc's character of Joey got a big boost in terms of emotional delivery in the episodes leading to the finale and the finale. It's time to bid farewell when everyone turns in their keys to the apartment, the other landmark set that is central to the show besides Central Perk. It brings to mind finally that over the last 10 years, everyone's lived there before. And together, we grew with the Friends through the laughter and the sorrow... This is a toast to one of the most successful sitcoms of our time and for me, it's also a show that saw me through the ups and downs of my life.

I loved 'Friends', it was one of my favorite shows. I thought the finale was so-so. I didn't really feel much of anything in the end. I cried a little in the episode BEFORE the finale, when Rachel was saying her goodbyes to the gang. But during the finale... nothing.

I was a little disappointed that R/R got back together. I know the writers were catering to the majority, but I've gone from being a Ross and Rachel fan to not being able to stand them together. It's been played out so many times over the last 10 years that it got tired and annoying. (to me, anyway)

It was a good ending, and really closed up nicely on some of there stories.

2052131,4,B00020HAWY,"I have mixed feelings about the Friends series finale, and how the show turned out in general.
I acutely stooped watching it on television during season four and am catching up with it, on DVD.
I still love the show of course. It's one of my top favorites. Even though it is extremely overrated.
 I all ways secretly wished that Phoebe and Joe got together. It was all most disappointing to me that they didn't.
All though I do like the guy who is Phoebe's husband. I all ways just felt that they had a good flow.
 However, it was interesting. because they were the only two in the group. Who did not end up with each other.
Ross and Rachel `finally' together. I have many thoughts on that.
 I saw it coming and at the same time I didn't.
I thought the ending was cute. When Rachel showed up at Roses' apartment and said,""She left.""
 However, they could have done a lot of many different things with the show.
 I do love Chandler and Joe in this episode. There really my favorites in the series.
 The Chick JR. and Duck JR. was so cute. Especially loved the part when Monica volunteered to destroy the hockey table game.
 There are moments in this finale I loved. Like Joe asking Ross to get him a muffin.
At the same time though I am disappointed.
 It would have been nice to see characters like Jack and Judy Geller. I love those characters. Even though there not on every episode. You know that you will all ways be entertained with them.
 I guess the series ending is just a little hard to swallow. There is allot more that they could have done with the show, and every one knows it.
What I do like about the finale though is this. They let the doors wide open for every character.
You know were there heading but you don't really know what's going to happen to them.
 The characters really are fun and great story lines most of the times. All though the sex jokes do get kind of old after a while.
In the end though I really do like the show and am still catching up with it. It's another one of those series, that left a big stamp on the world.

2052132,3,B00020HAWY,"Huge fan of FRIENDS here.  Sure, its a bit too ""overated"" and those who hate like this show are just sick and tired of its popularity.  Or they expect too much out of a ""simple"" sitcom!  Its really only a TV show.  This show actually happens to be one of a couple of all shows that I ever watch on TV!
Anyway, the acting was definately great, I thought!  But I am never a picky one anyhow.
However, I can see that Season 10 is probably one of the most disappointing comparing to Season 3-9 (which are my favourites).  I can only recall a FEW episodes from Season 10 that were good...only one that was REALLY good.
As of the Finale, I was hoping for a bit more.  Some viewers are right, there were truly only a few parts of the episode that were humourous.  To sum up, the Finale episode was quite a disappointment for me.  It didn't ""complete"" FRIENDS as I hoped it to do.  It seemed to me that the show has ended too quickly, and the producers were too much in a hurry to plot the whole episode in a short time frame.  I am a bit surprised some of the characteres didn't even show up (such as Emma, Carol & Susan, Ben, etc.).

It was probably expecting too much, considering how quickly they released the thing, but -- ""includes the Pilot episode""? What's exciting about that? Anyone who'd care enough to buy the finale probably has the Pilot on DVD already. ""Opening titles for all ten seasons""? Hmmm. Same problem, really.
The extra unaired footage from the finale does contain a couple of cute scenes, but when this episode is released on the season 10 DVDs (which will probably be within the next two years, at the rate they're going), I'm sure the bonus footage will be included.

2052138,4,B00020HAWY,"Our entire family are HUGE fans of FREINDS.  We own all seven seasons which are available on DVD, the first two videos which were released (Top 10 Episodes, Top 10 Fan Favs), as well as the recent Party Pack (released by Target).  So there was no question whether or not we would add the final episode DVD to our collection.  If you're a fan of the show, collect the DVDs or were one of the few who missed it, I encourage you to purchase this DVD.  After all, whether or not you like it or agree, it IS a piece of history (If the final episode of the FUGITIVE had been released 35 years ago - don't you think that would have been a best seller?!!)
Of course, the best part about this DVD is that both the original broadcast version AND the unedited version are included - which includes many moments which are even funnier than what aired that night - I really would have preferred to have seen Monica & Chandler's arrival at the hospital that night, instead of Chandler's ""church camp"" discussion with Erica (walking into the wrong delivery room - classic ""Bing""!). The entire opening sequence is different, and it's a shame that these scenes weren't included on that night. (I thought it was a little ""jolting"" opening the show with the ""morning after"" instead of seeing what happened immediately after Ross & Rachel's kiss the week before - I was glad to see it on the DVD). If it was a time issue, they should have just made the show 75 minutes that night, instead of the 66 minutes which were shown.  But it is worth the money to have it on this DVD.
I had really hoped that the one hour clip show shown before the final episode was going to be included.  In my opinion, this was just as much a part of the final episode, as the final episode itself, so I was disappointed when I found out that it wasn't included.  But I knew this before I even purchased the DVD, so I wasn't really disappointed AFTER I bought it.  I really hope that this episode will be included on the Season 10 Collection.  After all, it had its own title - ""The One Before the Final One"" - and it includes opening credits, so it appears to ""count"" as an episode this season.  There were many memorable clips included, and the two montages near the end of the show (one set to ""The Reason"") were beautifully done, and are worth watching over & over again (I actually videotaped the shows that night, and have watched the clip show a couple of times!).
I knew before I even purchased the DVD that the only ""extras"" were the 10 different show openings and the Rembrandts video (which can also be found on both of the earlier videos/DVDs).  I also knew that the pilot episode was going to be included (which can also be found on the very first video/DVD, as well as Season One Collection, so again, I wasn't really disappointed in the DVD itself, and I would definitely recommend that any fan or collector purchase it.  The reason I give it four stars instead of five has nothing to do with the quality of the DVD or its contents.
The reason I give it 4 stars is that I believe the clip show should have been included, and would have really preferred to have this episode together with the final episode instead of the pilot.  I'm sure most fans have seen the pilot repeatedly, and highly doubt that most people will turn to this DVD to watch it (if they haven't seen it already).  As I mentioned earlier, it can be found on both The Top Ten Episode video/DVD, as well as the Season One Collection, so I think it was a little pointless to include it here.  And while I guess I see why they include all ten season openings, how many times are fans really going to watch this?  (it gets quite annoying actually after about the 3rd or 4th season!!)  I had actually thought that the final episode would include a ""special"" opening, including a montage of clips of cast, showing how they've changed throughout the years (as they show each cast member's name, instead of showing the 2-3 clips they've shown all season, I thought they might have shown the different clips of each cast member throughout the years and leave out the full cast clips!- similar to what they did include on the DVD, only wrapped up into ONE opening!).
In my opinion, that is what would have made this DVD a 5 star DVD, instead of 4 - include the one hour clip show, the broadcast version and the unedited version of the final episode, and an opening with a montage of clips from all ten years, instead of ten separate openings, plus the Rembrandts video.  That would have been ideal, and would have made this Ltd Ed DVD a 5 star release!!
Still, I'm thrilled that it was released and so soon after it's airing, and I enjoyed watching what was ""missing"" that night.  It's a nice disc to throw on when you're looking for something ""quick"" to watch (in between reruns this summer!).
I'm now looking forward to Seasons 8, 9 and 10 and really, really hope that the clip show will be included on that final Season Collection!!  We all know that videotapes don't last forever, and it would be a shame if the one-hour clip show wasn't included somewhere where fans could watch it over & over again - It's an excellent way to wrap up 10 years of GREAT television into one hour of viewing, and is something I think most fans would appreciate having forever!!",1086566400,10,5293,4.403688524590164
2052139,2,B00020HAWY,"I loved the series finale! That said, I agree that the DVD disappoints.  The producers, creators, and writers spent 10 years focusing on and responding to audience reaction - what happened?!?  The 10 Years of Beginnings would have gotten a better reaction from this audience if it had been the piece that aired prior to the finale instead of 10 years worth of opening credits!
Actually, all of the DVDs in the Friends series have disappointed me with the lack of cast commentary/bloopers, etc.  The Special Features on this limited edition DVD and all of the season DVDs could have been awesome instead of mediocre.

2052146,3,B00020HAWY,"I am such a huge fan, it's not even funny. So when I purchased this DVD, I kinda had some pretty high expectations. While I think the episode itself was a perfect way of ending the series, I think this DVD was a poor attempt at capitalizing on the ending of the Friends franchise. And sure they have 3 more seasons to put out, but putting out the finale less than a week after it's airing is kinda... suspicious.
Anyway, this DVD contains only a few things: The Broadcast Version of the Finale and The Extended version (uncut). It also contains 10 Years of Beginnings which is a chronicle of the opening theme song for all 10 seasons, and it has the Pilot version (which can be found on season 1 anyway), and the music video with the Rembrandts.
I was surprised they didn't include any more, for example, the hour-long special they broadcast that night with a montage of clips for each character. Or those first interviews with the cast when the show premiered. Maybe even a photo album of some sort.
While I was pleased with the episode itself, I just thought the DVD could've contained more. Granted that probably would've raised its $10 pricetag, but Friends fans would be willing to pay more I'd thing as long as it was worth the money.",1085184000,7,1240,4.491150442477876
2052147,4,B00020HAWY,"Ok, you know youve all seen it, so its not spoiling much to dish at this point. It was a fitting tie-up of loose ends, and I really enjoyed it.  One thing I remember thinking periodically over the last few years was that, in real life, these people would not all still be friends with mostly each other.  They were all getting too old to still just be doing basically the same things and living in all the same places with the same people.  Tv is an escape, so its consistency was very comforting and successful in that way, and i appreciated that too, but it always bugged me in the back of my mind. It seems more real for them to be growing up and moving on, having kids, changing jobs, and buying houses, as much as i hate to see them go.  I also think I would have liked to see Ross and Rachel move to Paris together.  A big underlying component of their original breakup stemmed from Ross' jealosy over Rachel coming into her own in her new career, rather than just devoting all her time and attention to him, especially after having to overcome her pampered rich princess syndrome.  They fought about Mark, but I don't think he was the real issue.  It was wonderful to see them finally reunite, but I couldn't help but feel she was selling herself out, and letting him hold her back in life and success.  I think it would have boded better for them as a couple to see him acnowledge her growth as a person, to the point of moving for her, and in doing so, finally take responsibility for his part in the original derailment of the relationship.  But I know, im probably overanalyzing!
It might have been fun to watch Monica and Chandler ""attempt to handle this"" with the babies in their new house too, but i suppose they had to end it somewhere.  that probably would have gotten tiresome after too long, as well as even more inconvenient to write around than OccasionalEmma.  She was a cutie tho.
I am VERY grateful they did not kill anybody off for shock value, and it always drove me nuts they way the chick and the duck just disappeared with no explanation after being in the story for so long!  I could have handled even a little more detail on what was up with that!  C had them put to sleep? Old age? someone in the building finally called animal control?  they ate joeys condoms? what???
The new baby animals, and Phoebe's showtunes were sort of goofy, but the plusses definitely outweighed the minuses.  the gunther thing, the falange', the way phoebe screams rachel back out of the hallway , and the chandler panic/eight is enough lines were great.  The touching and poignant moments, Ross begging her to stay, leaving the keys, were very real, and ""i got off the plane"" totally made me lose it.  the first kiss music right then was a nice touch too.  one of the interviews i saw said the apartment was also a character we were saying goodbye to, and that was the reason for the long pan out.  They said they were going to end it in the coffee shop, but i agree, it would have been  too predictable, and maybe not seem as much like the end.  Thanks for a nice job guys!",1085097600,9,3084,4.356643356643357
2052148,4,B00020HAWY,"I have to say that I liked the finale, yet things were rushed. First off, season 10 should have just gotten off on a good start by hooking Ross and Rachel up, they were rushed, this plot line should have been early to mid-season material, not season finale material. The storyline just shows that ratings were the big concern here, not pleasing the nearly 24 million fans who loyally watched the rest of season 10. Nope we had to drawl everyone possible in and keep everyone in ""great suspense."" If this were a reality show I would honestly believe that Ross and Rachel would have split by now. Think about the fact that for the past seven years the two haven't dated and found it best to divorce when they married. Even the fact that they had Emma doesn't say much, if they were going to get married to supply Emma with a ""normal"" family they would have married in season eight or nine. Those three minutes we see the two together they seem more like the two kids in highschool who get in a relationship and break up only days later, not like a couple who planned to spend a life together. I guess we can only hope for the best, I mean they did have to get together or NBC and Bright, Kauffman, Crane would have had a huge problem on their hands. My next problem was not taking Phoebe anywhere. Ok she and Mike decided to start a family but what else are they going to do. I would have liked to see them move next door to Chandler and Monica or something. (Lord knows Janice didn't move there) I just felt more should have been done with her, and anyone notice that past their marriage Mike has been almost non-existant. Next with Joey, thank you, THANK YOU for NOT setting up the spin-off. That would have totally killed the episode, especially if ""Joey"" fails. As for his storyline, it was nice, because hes getting a spin-off you really don't need an end for him, I like how his ending was handled. Finally, Chanlder and Monica and Jack and Erika. This was the true suprise of the finale. I can never get over Monica's face when she hears she'll be getting twins. The scene reminds me a lot of when Lucy tells Ricky shes pregnant in ""I Love Lucy."" It was touching and you can just tell Monica will be raising three kids (sorry Chandler). All in all it wasn't awful, thank God no one went to jail or died or anything, finales aren't supposed to be like that, at least not for a situation comedy.

Now as for the DVD. For ten bucks a hit its ok. We get two versions of the finale, the extended somewhere between four and five minutes longer, nothing much is added to the plot however. Most fans already have the pilot one way or another but it is nice to be able to watch that and then go right to the finale. Its amazing that the hair and clothing styles are the only big change in the show, which is a good thing. You can tell when comparing the two episodes the creators knew what they wanted for the characters. The Remembrants video is nice, they really need it on a season set though. The opening clips montage is nice but the theme song can become annoying. I was really hoping they would take each characters opening clips and put them together using the three minute long theme song, and they do have enough for that because each season has somewhere from two to four different openeing clip sequences for each season. The DVD could have had more and I too was disappointed there was not bow but it should NOT be added to the episode. That cheapens the idea of Friends as a show, however it should be on the DVD somewhere. As for all the stuff NBC used to build up the finale, don't expect it on the season ten DVD, unless Warner Brothers owns the rights to those shows. Also, this DVD is in no way limited so you don't have to rush out thinking you may get a copy. The Sam's Club in my area still has somewhere near 100 copies left and they aren't exactly flying off the shelf, plus the area I live in isn't huge. All in all pick it up if you want to be able to own both versions of the finale (which with a finale is sorta nice to be able to do). Otherwise pass this up and wait for season ten's release.",1085097600,3,4117,4.257982120051086
2052149,4,B00020HAWY,"If you love the show Friends"", but don't feel like going bankrupt buying all these complete seasons, this nice, afforable DVD is a good pick. You get the excellent finale that easily ranks among the all-time best farewells. It spares any uneeded twists and just gives what we love-the cast at their funny best. When they all turn in their keys at the nicely sentimental ending, you're left with the feeling that what you've witnessed the end to was really something special, even if it is just a TV show.
You also get the extended version, which has a completly different beginning and some other extra footage. While extra footage can be iffy (it generally is cut out for a reason after all), this is defiantly an exception. All the extra scenes score. There's also a great bonus feature that shows ten years of those unforgettable opening credits.
The only downside is that it does not include the clip show shown with the original airing. I would have really liked to have that. It also would have been nice if it included some of the interviews shown during the last week. However, it's not like that's what you paid for. It is called BONUS material for a reason. The finale is the product and this product does not dissapoint.",1085097600,3,1231,4.6255707762557075
2052150,3,B00020HAWY,"The finale was great - I love that there is an extended edition of the finale on the special edition DVD.  That's about the only great thing on this DVD.  OK, the pilot is included - all true Friends fans probably already have Season 1 on DVD which includes the pilot, no big deal here.  Where are the commentaries?  Where are the interviews that flew across the TV the week of the finale?  Seriously, not even the flashback episode is included?  You've got to be kidding me.
I never would have bought the DVD if I'd known I wasn't getting any of these things.  I ran right out the morning it was released and picked it up at the store, came straight home to check out the special features I expected to see and had major disappointment.  Hopefully some of these missing features will be included when Season 10 hits DVD.",1085011200,3,821,4.3907284768211925

The special features were sort of a let down but the finale was fantastic depite what some of the reviews say on this website. But if you only want special features then I would order the finale dvd from amazon.co.uk it has such better special features than the R1 dvd does, including:
Flashback bloopers from every series.
a documenry.
and some of the same extras.
So if you only want special features then order it from

The extended version's extra scenes weren't that great--though they did show that Monica noticed the red paint on her couch! I was wondering about that when the finale first aired!
Even though it was relatively low-priced DVD, it really isn't worth the money. It would have been easier to just tape the final episode than wait in anticipation for this HUGE disappointment!",1084752000,8,517,4.886363636363637
2052154,3,B00020HAWY,"As a die-hard fan of ""Friends"" since Day One, my hopes were high for this, the DVD to end all DVD's --- the series finale.  Yes, we all saw the finale, as broadcast, and it was satisfying in some ways, predictable in others.  But what I had most hoped for in this DVD never surfaced --- the numerous endings that were filmed to keep the masses forever guessing until Thursday, May 6th at 8:00 p.m. (7:00 Central).
I had anticipated seeing numerous outtakes from that final taping, both the humorous and the heart-wrenching.  I would have loved to have seen their final bow... as well as the dedication of ""The Friends Stage"" at Warner Bros, which the cast attended.
This was an opportunity to give the fans MORE than they could have imagined and a peek into the special world that belonged to our ""Friends.""  Sadly, what we were given were two versions of the final show: The broadcasted and non-broadcasted versions.  The non-broadcast version contained a couple of scenes not critical to the final episode, as well as a couple of swear words from Rachel (Jennifer Aniston)- nothing earth shattering.  Also included, all 10 montage beginnings from the 10 seasons and The Rembrandts music video.  Also, as noted in another review - there wasn't even an insert in the DVD case.
It's obvious that this was thrown together quickly, with not much care attached to it (there was enough lead time, I believe, to have made this a true collector's item).  I only hope that when Season 10 surfaces that 'the powers that be' will consider including the elements listed above.",1084665600,10,1565,4.727941176470588
2052155,5,B00020HAWY,"So, after 10 years, it comes down to this.  Chandler and Monica are at the hospital waiting for the birth of their baby on the day before they move to their new house.  But they might just have a surprise waiting for them.  Meanwhile, Joey has a housewarming present for them, Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.  Phoebe wants to turn the day into a musical.  But the finale wouldn't be complete without another chapter in the Ross/Rachel soap opera we've been following for 10 years.  Rachel's leaving for Paris, and Ross needs to decide if he wants to try to stop her by telling her how he feels.  And with this gang of six involved, you can be sure there will be plenty of laughs.
I've been a fan for a few years now, catching up on the show thanks to constant reruns.  And while the show did loose something in the last couple of seasons, I kept watching.  This finale was exactly what this Friends fan was hoping for - plenty of laughs as the gang of six faced some changes in their lives.  It really did feel like starting a new chapter and not a harsh goodbye at all, even if the last couple of scenes were very bitter sweet.  It was especially nice to see a few nods to classic moments from the show, with appearances by Gunther and Mike, Joey's present, and the infamous ""We were on a break!"" line.
With the quick release and low price of this DVD, I wasn't expecting much in the way of extras.  Since my expectations were low, I wasn't disappointed.  The DVD features the broadcast version and an extended version of the finale as well as an extended version of the pilot.  Boy have styles changed in 10 years!  Both episodes feature great sound and clear picture.  It also features the music video for the classic theme and 10 of the opening credits.  As any Friends fan knows, they usually changed them half way through the season, so we're only getting about half here.  But we do get a couple special ones, like the London opening and the Arquette joke.
Since I'm sure it won't be long before season 10 hits selves in a complete set, it's really up to you to decide if you want to get this now or wait for the set later.  I loved the finale so much I just had to go out and get it.

However, am I the only one to get this crazy DVD and NOT receive an insert? Has this happened to anyone else? Am I just extremely unlucky? If the DVD just doesn't come with an insert at all, that seems like a huge judgement error on the part of the company!",1084665600,,536,4.479591836734694
2052157,4,B00020HAWY,"The season finale of ""Friends"" lived up to everything the show was meant to be about. This show was, for the most part, about being light, funny, happy, and a ""feel-good"" show. I'm glad Kauffman and Crane kept true to their premise of the show and didn't pull a ""Seinfeld"" on us and have someone die and end their relationships on a sour or sad note.
Some thoughts: I was disappointed that Ross and Monica's parents- the Gellers- (Elliot Gould & Cristina Pickles) didn't make a quick appearance for us to say good-bye to. Phoebe should have given us one last wacky song in Central Perk instead of the lame musical attempt. I thought the finale should have been expanded to at least 90 minutes. It felt a bit rushed and some scenes/storylines (example, the babies' post-births) seemed a bit too abbreviated. Or as Judy (Mrs. Geller) said in one episode, ""... that's a lot of information to absorb in 30 seconds."" I was glad the episode did give some time to Chandler and Joey rescuing chick, jr. and duck, jr. Their relationship was always a very important component of the show and I'm glad it was given proper ""recognition."" Finally, I would have changed the last scene. Instead of panning an empty apartment for our last memory of the show (what was that about?), I would have faded to our favorite six friends sitting on the couch in Central Perk having a last latte toast to each other. After all, the show was about our ""friends,"" not the ""apartment.""
Some fun things on this CD... the 10 seasons' opening credits that show us how our friends, hairstyles, clothes matured/changed over the life of the show. I realized it was the open title sequence from each season's first episode because of the one season when everyone got named ""Arquette"" in recognition of Courtney Cox's marriage to David Arquette. How come they didn't do that when Jennifer Aniston married Brad Pitt? (heh heh) The expanded version is nice too as it fills in a couple of compenents that made the storyline run a little smoother to me and supports my opinion this episode should have been longer. I would have replaced the first episode on this disc to ""clip show"" of some funny snipets that the show had so many of... ""So how many cameras are actually on you?""  ""See you girls later."" Yikes! Better not get started, I won't be able to stop! (heh heh)
Thanks to all for rushing the production of the episode for us loyal fans. I thought I would be waiting for awhile until season 10 was released on DVD to be able to catch it again in DVD quality. Hopefully, the season 10 set will be able to expand more possible scenes from the final episode that are not on this DVD.
""Friends"" was a show that clicked with me from episode #1 and for the past couple of television seasons, the only show I really looked forward to seeing each week. This show was border-line genuis in so many ways to me with the quality of the writing and actors. ""Friends"" became an ""institution"" and a habit for so many- and it will be a hard one to break and replace! My title for the NEXT ""Friends"" episode- The One Where They Get Together Again.  (hint hint)
Also- Joey (Matt Le Blanc)- Good luck! Break a leg, bud! Welcome to L.A.! Will be looking forward to seeing what you can give us this fall to help fill a bit of this huge void left for all the fans!",1084665600,5,3308,4.475165562913907
2052158,4,B00020HAWY,"This DVD like the series is amazing, FRIENDS truly was one of the best series finales of all right along with FRASIER, NBC sure knows how to pick lasting, enduring and moving shows.
My only complaint with this DVD is that they were remiss in not including the 40 mins prior to the finale of all the gangs funniest clips, other than that the DVD is perfect.
I also love the extended version of the finale as well as the broadcast one. Also I was wondering has anyone else noticed that in the 10 YEARS OF BEGINNINGS segment that in Season 6 the credits list every cast member with the last name ARQUETTE lol , was DAVID busier than we thought that year ? apparently he not only married Courtney but all of our other friends. has anyone else noticed this ? if not look and see I don't know if all the DVDs are made like that or I have a special one, though I doubt it.
BRAVOOOOOOOOO to FRIENDS , I matured along with the show and through the show I had MANY laughing moments and shedded several tears as well.

2052159,4,B00020HAWY,"For ten seasons, Friends proved to be one of the most endearing and effortlessly likeable sitcoms on television, not necessarily because of great writing (which it did often, though not always, sport), but because of the first-rate cast, which had a mixture of a comic/romantic/dramatic chemistry that I doubt will ever be matched by another television series.
The final episode, entitled The Last One, is a fine, if unspectacular, end to the series.  Running at around 45 minutes (sans the commercials), this final episode resolves several subplots that had been running throughout the final season.  Chandler and Monica finally become parents, but with a small surprise that leads to the episode's funniest line, delivered with perfect sarcasm by Matthew Perry.
But the resolution most fans want to see is if whether Ross and Rachel get back together.  Their on-and-off relationship has been at times comical, romantic, touching, or just plain annoying, but it works well here.  The last half-hour is built around the typical cliche of man trying to chase after his lover and stop her from leaving his life forever (or in this case, just a long period of time), but the situation delivers plenty of good laughs, especially when, in order to convince Rachel to get off the plane, Phoebe B.S.'s that the plane's left filangee isn't working.
The cast has been together for so long that it's hard not to refer to them by their characters' names.  Truthfully, I'm not even certain if anyone of these six can even break away from the character they've been associated with for ten years (certainly not Matt LeBlanc, who'll continue playing Joey next season).  But as a farewell episode, The Last One is a solid reminder of why I enjoyed this show so much.",1084579200,4,1751,4.938775510204081
2052160,4,B00020HAWY,"Well.. $10 for just the series finale may seem too much, but I rather think of $1 per season, an A++ (or a 10 as we grade in Mexico) for this series that made us laugh, cry, remember, and have a good time for an entire decade. It marked the late 90's and early new millenium, and by having bad news after bad news, they were always there giving us fun.

2052163,4,B00020HAWY,"And if you haven't purchased the DVD, why submit a review???  Is it just me or do these questions begged to be answered..... Anyway, I didn't really find anything new in this DVD, the extras included probably aren't worth the price if you aren't a huge fan of the show.  However, if you plan on collecting the entire ""Friends"" DVD collection (as I am), then you'd probably want this to be a part of your collection.... I loved this show and I'm gonna miss this group of wacky and lovable characters a great deal.  Thursday was the one night I'd veg out in front of the TV with my family and not worry about language or content.  In my book, getting the opportunity to see over and over the moment where Ross finds out that Rachel did get off that plane is worth the price. And the added bonus of seeing Monica and Chandler's quest for parenthood turn into a twofer had this show ending just as it should have.  As a hopeless romantic, I needed the show to end just as it did and the writers and producers delivered.  In short, if you liked the finale and didn't TiVo it, I don't think you'll regret the chance to go down the ""Friends"" memory lane anytime you like.  And with the state of TV today, and glut of sadistic reality shows, the ""Friends"" DVD collection is a good thing to have when you wonder why you spent so much money on that 52in Hi-definition television.  The collection isn't over-priced like some (i.e. ""The X-Files"") and after watching any of the episodes, you're guaranteed to walk away with a smile.  What more can you ask from a comedy series??
MY ONE COMPLAINT:  I think that, instead of including the pilot episode (which diehard fans probably already have with the first season DVD collection), they probably should've included the hour-long retrospective that aired prior to the finale.  Having a lot of my favorite moments all on 1 disc would be a nice thing to have.
And as for the venom spewing non-fans, GET A LIFE!!!  Some of the reviews submitted has obviously been written for the expresss purpose of trashing a show most of them admitted to not liking or even watching.  I know that warm, fuzzy, & feel-good comedy isn't everyone's cup of tea, but I can't help but think that if those people looked at life with a positive view, and had real friends who genuinely loved and supported them, they'd see the value of our beloved TV ""Friends"" in a whole new light.",1084406400,,2393,4.486175115207374

I loved the ending when Ross and Rachel got  back together it will be hard but I will survive they were all Friends we all felt like Friends with them.

2052167,1,B00020HAWY,"Let me first say that I am a big fan of Friends.  I bought this DVD today because I was under the impression that the ""extended version"" of the final episode would be better.  Well, truth be told, I only noticed about 5 minutes of new material on the DVD.  This was hardly worth the $10.
The ""several other bonus features"" as described in Amazon's Editorial description were virtually non-existant.  There was the music video for the Friends theme, and a retrospect of the show intros over the years.  Ooooooh.  Big deal.
The ""extended version"" didn't have any real extras, and it was barely worth watching.  I'm very disappointed with my purchase.  (Also, it's not so ""limited"" of an edition.  Meijer stores alone have 50,000 copies and they only operate in 5 states.  You do the math.)

Friends has been the greatest show on television for the past ten years. Sure it had its rough spots and was a little corny at times, but when all was said and done we still loved Ross, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, Joey and Phoebe as if they were our ACTUAL friends. I know I did. I was so sad to see the show come to an end, but it will forever live in my heart - and on DVD!",1084233600,8,638,4.031496062992126
2052169,4,B00020HAWY,"I think there are two different reviews here, one for the show and one for this DVD.  As far as the DVD is concerned, it is ""good"".  It isn't great, but it is good.
The DVD does have:
  1.  A nice extended version.
The DVD does not have:
  1.  Interviews with each cast member.
  2.  Interviews with the writers.
  3.  Behind the Scenes footage.
  4.  Outtakes and Bloopers.
  5.  Alternate endings.
I think that if the DVD had these things then I would have given it a perfect 5-Star rating.
As far as the show is concerned, the ending is ""okay"".  It is rushed.  It is only 1 hour, instead of the expected (and deserved) two hours.  You will not see Rachel and Ross get married, even though we deserved to see it after following the show for 10 years.  There are a number of pieces missing from the ending.  You literally get the sense that they put a major rush job on the ending just to get it out the door and over with.  It is very sad to see the show end, but even sadder to not feel like you received the ending you deserved after 10 long years of faithful watching.  I do think that, at the ever least, Rachel and Ross should have gotten married or even just a proposal in the finale but it didn't happen.
So, yes, you will want to buy the DVD if you are a fan of Friends, a collector, or just want to see what you missed.  It is worth having.  But you may be sad and disappointed if you expected a packed DVD with a lot of features and the ending you really wanted to see.",1084233600,33,1481,4.062717770034843
2052170,1,B00020HAWY,"This was one of the worst series finales I have ever seen.  If you're into all of the sappy Ross/Rachel stuff, and watched Friends for the romance instead of the laughs, this finale is right up your ally. It was filled with melodramatic Ross/Rachel segments, and a few tidbits of Monica and Chandler, and didn't focus at all on the other characters.  Where was the humor and all of the well-written jokes that made Friends so funny?  They weren't in this episode.  While I realize a finale is supposed to tie up loose ends and finish off the series, they had plenty of time to include some comedy in the hourlong episode.
As a finale, this episode was VERY bland, and not worth the $11 for a DVD that features only the episodes, and no special feautres.  They could at least include the Dateline special or the pre-show interview with the cast.",1084147200,9,844,4.526315789473684

All and all the show was tepid, although much better than Seinfeld, which has to be my least favorite show of all time.  I mean seriously, if you saw the first episode, you knew what was going to happen in the last. Ross is a dork and Rachel's just not that attactive. I mean I wouldn't kick her out of my bed, but I wouldn't invite her into my bed either.
So it takes a week to get one episode of Friends and I've been waiting like 10 years for any episodes of Cop Rock. There's no justice in this world.",1084147200,6,706,3.971830985915493

It's about time the writers wrote an ending the fans actually wanted to see (...)!!!
Kudos to the writers and cast for 10 great years.  This DVD will not only let you see the pilot episode and the series finale in it's entirety...but the series finale is also presented in an ""extended version"" for the fans who want to see more!!!",1083974400,6,524,4.623655913978495
2052176,4,B00020HAWY,"SOme fans were happy, some were not.  Critics overall were not happy.  But I think Kauffman and Crane did a decent job on putting out a series finale.  The bottom line is that even though it was an hour long on tv, there were about 25 minutes of commercials.  It's very difficult to end a 10 year series in just 35 minutes of airtime.  They added their own twists, which I thought were good, but they still had to keep the laughter alive as best they could, all the while trying to also retain sentiment as a farewell episode.  All the critics can crucify the finale, but it was done in a way that kept the laughter, tears, and surprises together...in 35 minutes no less.  Predictability was also a complaint from critics and some fans.  But once again, this is a finale.  There were good endings for many reasons, and I think one was to thank their fan base.  The other was to keep the theme of the entire series prevelant in the farewell: Friends being there for you.  To make the unexpected twist or unfortunate moment would only be a slap in the face to many of the loyal fans.  Friends isn't an oscar plotted series.  It's a sitcom designed for humour but as well as emotion.  Seinfeld mastered the humour, but I think Friends did a great job of combining the two.  The producers wanted viewers to feel happy once they shut off their tvs to must see thursday.  If you want to be clever and unexpected...go with the Seinfeld finale...we all remember that outcome and how many fans were far more furious.  Not a good way to thank your fans.",1083974400,,1543,4.395759717314488

As it was well pointed out in one of the reviews, this website is reserved for comments about the DVD of the final episode not the whole show. I am and always will be a fan of Friends. In my opinion (something everyone is entitle to) this was the greatest comedy show there was and it has ten years to its name to prove it. I love every single episode even though there are some better than others. I love the final episode and even though I watched it two nights ago and I plan to buy every single season, I still want to buy this limited edition of the finale. Was it predictable that Ross and Rachel were going to end up together? You bet! Did that make it bad? Not in the least! I particularly loved the way they finally came to be together. The word was out on the TV Guide a week before that they were in fact going to end up together, just how it should have been. I am somewhat sad that the show is over but they'll always be on syndication which is somehow comforting. And for all of you that are jelous of the earning of the cast read this ""over the next ten years it is estimated that each of the cast members will receive over 55 millions in syndication rights alone"" --now how you like that?

However, the finale was kinda corney, making me flip through Full House and this episode.  I usely don't flip during Friends but this time I did because, I was taping it.  But anyway, I loved this episode after the 2 time and it kinda grows on you.  I love Friends and this will be part of my collection when I can get it!  Thanks!!  Bye!!

2052179,3,B00020HAWY,"One of the things I always liked best about this series has been the quality of the writing, and I think this episode was one the worst-written of it's entire run. It was too self-conscious, too self-aware of it's finality (if that's a word), too predictable, with all of the most obvious conclusions, and too sentimental.  The fact that the writers made a point of telling us how Monica could afford such a huge apartment in NYC was so awkward - is that something that the viewers really had to know?  To have Gunther finally tell Rachel how he feels took so much away from his long-running obsession of her - it changed him from being a completely fringe character (which is how he was best), and turned him into a guy that was trying to be a fully fleshed-out character.  And was anyone surprised by how the birth of Monica and Chandler's baby went?
I was not happy about how the character of Phoebe was handled at all.  She didn't have much of a storyline, and was obsessed with showtunes...that didn't even make any sense, not even for her; it was just too out-of-character for her.  It was way more dweebie than kooky (and we all know that dweebie is Ross's department).  They had a more than a whole hour - you would think such talented writers would be able to come up with something better for her. And the Joey storyline didn't kick in for awhile, and it was a pretty weak effort to bring back the birds.  Scattered throughout the entire show were references to how far they've come in the last ten years...could it BE more nostalgic?
To top it off, the entire energy of the show felt a little down, but I'm sure that I can attribute that to the fact that it was probably hitting all of the actors that it was the last show. Gone were the occasional bursts of emotion, surprise, horror, etc., that were often the some of the funnest and energetic parts of the show. The energy of the entire episode seemed subdued. (A favorite scene of my from a past show is from one of the Thanksgiving shows - it's where Ross and Monica's parents are guests, and, one after another, each of the Friends bursts out with what was on their mind...""Ross smoked pot in college!"" ""Monica and Chandler are living together!"" ""I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle"" ""I love Jacques Cousteau!"" ""I want to GO!"")
The obvious conclusion of the Ross & Rachel saga was the most disappointing to me.  I think most of us were over them years ago, and to go back to it yet again, just made it all the more obvious how stale that storyline has become.
The best thing about the whole show was that they didn't even attempt to set up the spin-off - I am very happy that they stayed away from that, because it would have just cheapened it.
Still, it wasn't completely horrible. Chandler in the delivery room was funny, and the least self-consciously written character of the entire show. And I thought the visual of the foozball table in pieces was funny, with the guys stunned that Monica didn't use the tools to take it apart.
And I was touched by the scene with the keys. Even though the door was never locked (except for in ""The One Where Underdog Gets Away"") the point was made that Monica's apartment had been a real home, a physical center for all of them for a long time, and now it was time to go.",1083888000,14,3286,4.3930921052631575
2052180,5,B00020HAWY,"I thought it ended the best way it could. There was no HUGE life altering ending that made the last ten years feel like a joke and there could have been. It wasn't over the top sappy, it kept it's normal lovable joke format, and it tied everything together nicely. Yes I wish the show would continue but I'm glad they ended on a high note. We got to see the characters for who they really were one last time. Even though this season had a lot to deal with we were reminded of Joey's heart with the chick and duck , Rachel and Ross's need to be together, and how classic Ross's reactions are *I'm mainly commenting on the bit with the phone message from Rachel* , there was the classic akward Chandlerisms in the hospital with Erica, when he was comparing child birth and being kicked in the alls,we were reminded of Monica's control and competition problem, when she was the one to destroy the foos ball table and did anyone else find that  a little symbolic? She's tearing Chandler and Joey apart...hmm..and lastly we were reminded of Phoebe's craziness and kindness when she was driving Ross to the airport to meet up with Rachel. I loved it. I have to admit my expectations were high like all Friends fanatics were and I know they would never be able to meet my expectations because if they did the show would never end and it would remain great, however I am satisfied with this ending and I have to admit I cried before the opening credits were finished. I watched the show for the last ten years of my life. I literally jumped for joy when Ross and Rachel first kissed, and I was shocked when Monica and Chandler were in bed together in England, I was thrilled they never tried too hard to match Phoebe and Joey together, because...it wouldn't work. And I adored Phoebe's songs in the coffee house, I thought the last Chandler joke was sweet and perfect, and the bit with the keys was funny, because we all know they never really used those keys all that much, and the joke with Ross wanting to be a dancer and the tiny reference to the show being ten years old made me cry harder because it was actually over,I love the show and I'll miss it, but there is always the chance to catch it in rerun.",1083888000,12,2202,4.357664233576642

As with life, people move on and change,but the bond of friendship with always be there.  I'm so glad I wasn't disappointed like I was with Seinfeld. Most of you reading this probably haven't seen the finale so, I won't spoil it with what happens.  Just trust me.  This is a very well done finale.",1083888000,2,611,4.206896551724138
2052182,5,B00020HAWY,"I think the way they ended the series was a perfect payoff for the fans of FRIENDS who watched the show over the past 10 years. I was 28 when the program began in 1994 and was going through the same life issues as the characters. This sitcom became something to look forward to at the end of a very stressful week, and I really needed some comedy in life by Thursday nights!! FRIENDS had a great ensemble cast unlike any other that made the characters a permanent part of pop culture. I don't understand why people with no sense of humor (or life) would feel the need to waste time bad mouthing a show that obviously wasn't meant for them, but gave a lot of pleasure and happiness to a lot of people. If sitcoms are not for you, then go watch something that is more suited to your IQ, such as The Bachelor or Survivor!! FRIENDS isn't a show for everyone, just for people with a sense of humor!!
I will remember my favorite episodes for the rest of my life and long after reality TV has come and gone.
Thank you FRIENDS for always cheering me up when I needed it most!",1083888000,,1067,4.209756097560976
2052183,4,B00020HAWY,"Well, I suppose there were some ""Friends"" fanatics who did not tape the series finale last night and who do not already own the pilot episode.  But then I always hold on to the possibility that winged monkeys could come flying out of specific orifice.  Besides, given that the final episode ran over when it appears in syndication in two parts some scenes are going to have to be cut or shortened (I vote for Chandler's discussion with Erica regarding camp) so this will be the only opportunity to have the complete version of ""The Last One,"" at least until it comes out in the best of the final season and the complete final season DVD collections.
I really thought that overall the final season of ""Friends"" was one of its weakest.  For me the series derailed when Joey fell for Rachel and not because I thought it was a bad idea.  My favorite moments with Matt LeBlanc in the series where his dealing with being in love with Rachel.  But they messed up the timing with the plot line, so by the time they were willing to give it a try it felt forced and ended up with everybody deciding it will not work.  Fortunately the end of the whole sorry affair was excellent, with Rachel wondering why she and Joey cannot do what Monica and Chandler did, and Joey observing that they were much better friends.  The high point of the final season was clearly Phoebe's wedding and most of the rest of it in the last half was geared towards the final episode, so now is the time to render a verdict on ""The Last One.""
Wisely this episode did nothing to set up the ""Joey"" spinoff and while the whole baby birds stuck in the foosball table seems like something that make for an entertaining regular episode of ""Friends,"" it did serve as a rather fitting metaphor for the relationship between Joey and Chandler.  We get another subtle metaphor at the end with the bit with the keys.  Phoebe gets to bounce around between the various plot lines and provides support and/on havoc, which is just more proof that Lisa Kudrow is going to be one of the finest supporting actresses of her generation.
The one thing I really wanted for the final episode was for Monica to announce she was pregnant, but that was probably just an extension of my relief that Courtney Cox Arquette finally got pregnant.  I really felt for her having to endure years of pregnancy watches in the tabloids while she not only suffered miscarriages in her personal life but had to deal with her character's infertility problems as well.  The surprise in the delivery room was pretty good and I suppose we should not be surprised that Erica was able to part with her offspring without any of the pathos of Pheobe saying goodbye to her triplets.  Clearly the scenes at the hospital were not intended to be the centerpiece of the finale.
The person who stands out in the final episode is obviously David Schwimmer as Ross.  The episode before the finale was the one where Jennifer Aniston's Rachel really got emotional; that episode was more the one where the characters got a chance to say goodbye to each other, leaving it to the finale to say goodbye to the characters and their fans.  After the nice fake out at the end of Act Three, set up by all those preview adds for the finale, Schwimmer, who could often be over the top annoying, gets to the big moment in the life of Ross and nails it, reminding everybody why Rachel was in love with him (although it takes her a while to remember).  Ross also has the best comic moment of the finale when he checks out his answering machine but Aniston's timing and delivery of the episode's best live is just as good.  It is Schwimmer and Aniston that made parts of the series finale special, which is especially impressive when you consider that Ross and Rachel getting back together was what 77% of viewers (according to one poll I saw) wanted.  With such high expectations coming close is a good trick and the moment compares favorable to the emotional highpoint of the series, which was Chandler's proposal to Monica (and visa versa).
""The Final One"" was written by Marta Kauffman & David Crane, but I am sure everybody on the staff and in the crew had input.  The initial estimate is that 51.1 million tuned in to watch the final episode, which is only two-thirds of the audience reigned in by the finales of ""Seinfeld"" (76.0) and ""Cheers"" (80.4), but still good for fourth place (way behind ""M*A*S*H"" at 105 million viewers) and the most popular entertainment program on television since the last episode of the first ""Survivor,"" watched by 51.7 million in August 2000.  But if there is one thing that most final episodes prove to us is that they are never totally satisfying, so the idea that the last episode of ""Friends"" was not a disappointment is a pretty good outcome.",1083888000,72,4778,4.554259043173862
2052184,5,B00020HAWY,"The final episode of ""Friends"" was a good one, if not totally outstanding.  But then again, how can you top all of the other great episodes that the series had with this one?  These days, finales usually do not top all other episodes of a long-running series (Seinfeld and Roseanne being great examples; although Larry Sanders' finale might be different from the rule).
However, I have always enjoyed the series.  Sure, the finale could have been better (from a resolution standpoint), but I say who cares, at least it didn't give its fans - and those who were watching it - a slap in the face, thus ruining a great run.  The finale of ""Friends"" may have been emotional and somewhat sappy, but it went out on a good note.  Thank you, ""Friends,"" for 10 great years.",1083888000,,764,4.547445255474453
2052185,2,B00020HAWY,"I'm not writing here to pathetically demean those who have the audicity to actually watch and, for heaven's sake, like ""Friends.""  But the final episode was pretty excruciating, which was probably a good sign that they chose to end the series now rather than later.  Think about TV shows that started off great but whose legacies floundered because they overstayed their welcome: ""Ally McBeal,"" ""The Drew Carey Show,"" ""E.R.,"" ""The West Wing,"" etc.  ""Friends"" has not been very good for a few years now--but not horrible--and they ended the show in the perfect manner to befit their huge fanbase: by FINALLY getting Ross and Rachel together.  But how they arrived at this conclusion during the show was just nauseating.  The whole ""I'm gonna tell her I love her, no, I'm not gonna tell her I love her"" trip to the airport stuff was just a dizzying spectacle delaying the inevitable (who can't predict that Rachel will get off the plane and return to Ross, proclaiming her love?), and provided little satisfaction.  Also, the show's focus on Monica and Chandler's unexpected surprise--twins--shows that they are going to be wonderful parents (I say with the utmost sarcasm).  I was probably more saddened that the foosball table was destroyed than by anything else in the episode!  So now we can get over this all-out media assault, the $2 million advertising slots for the episode, etc., and resume being inundated by the reruns of ""Friends"" that appear on like 20 cable stations simultaneously.",1083888000,,1494,4.971887550200803

2052187,5,B00020HAWY,"I can't even begin to describe Friends. I've been watching that show since I was, like, seven years old. I have successfully seen every episode (except maybe one or two of which I have no knowledge of not having seen).
Though imperfect (i.e. Monica and Chandler immediately leaving the hospital, no one else going to the hospital with them, leaving the twins in the apartment and then going across the hall), this episode did definite justice to the entire series, tying most loose ends.
Ross and Rachael did get together, but that's no surprise. Monica and Chandler adopted children and it turned out they were twins, but I'm as unsure as you as to how they couldn't have realized that beforehand. Even prior to this episode, we saw the outcome of Janice and in this episode, we saw Gunther - at last - confess his undying love for Rachael. We even got to learn the history of the disappearance of the chick and the duck!
The only loose ends I would have liked to have seen get tied up are those of Richard, Chandler, and Phoebe. We never really did find out if Richard found happiness in life sans-Monica. Phoebe never saw her mother during these last episodes. And Chandler seems to have ammends left to be made with his sexually-open mother and his homosexual father.
I would also have liked to have seen Monica and Chandler move into their own house and Rachael and Ross get engaged and Joey have gotten on with his moving to LA. Oh yes, and I wished Phoebe and Mike would have had more screentime together as a married couple, and maybe Phoebe get pregant, but that's all just wishful thinking.
To wrap things up (I must be boring you), this was not the best Friends episode ever; it was not the funniest, it was not the most dramatic, and it wasn't very romantic - but the times we spend with our friends rarely are, and so it seems that all justice was served towards the tremendous series. I feel like a part of my life has been dead since Chandler jokingly asked ""Where?"" they would get a cup of coffee.

This was a great show, and the finale was a great episode.  It was probably one of the best finales I have ever seen.  It gave closure to the show in the best way that it could.  One more thing, for the people that said this cast was greedy, you could not be more wrong.  Yes, they made a ton per episode, but this cast took a chance from the very beginning and did something that no other cast of a TV series has done up to this point.  They negotiated their contracts together and did not want to be paid different salaries, they stuck together, knowing that it could backfire.

I just don't understand why they even bothered to write it if didn't mean anything to them.  As for the Shield I watch that and yes it is a great show but it is totally different than  Friends.  I guess alot of people disagree because it had great  rating. I am so glad they are releasing it so soon after it airs. I will miss the laughs from that show so much.

That said, why on God's green Earth would anyone, and I mean ANYONE, be dumb enough to fork over ten bucks for a show that is less than two hours long. Now, a movie, I can understand, but 'Friends'? WHY WOULD YOU NOT WAIT FOR SEASON TEN TO COME OUT and pay three times that amount of money for probably five times that much show. It would be stupid. I guess I can understand if you don't WANT all of the season, you would still be getting a ton more for your money. Anyway, unless you DIDN'T tape it, and are DESPERATE, and I mean slit-your-throat desperate, to see it, WAIT FOR SEASON TEN AND JUST SAVE UP MONEY!!!",1083888000,,729,4.177304964539007

I was upset how the series went from a show that had good writing and great characters to very formulaic, idiotic show.  The Rachel and Ross thing got old really quick.  And Joey, could he get any dumber?  I totally understand why they stretched out the series, money.  Everybody made bank off of the show, including the actors, NBC, and Warners, but I feel we as viewers suffered for it.

But this review is about the final show.  It totally redeemed itself.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't the greatest show ever to air on TV.  But for FRIENDS, it was a good way to say good bye.",1083888000,,720,4.353383458646617
2052192,1,B00020HAWY,"Friends is a show that has made network television increasingly difficult to watch, because its derivative (albeit highly successful) concept has been duplicated so many times (""Buddies"", ""It's Like, You Know"", and ""Two Guys, A Girl & A Pizza Place"" automatically spring to mind) that it has become a monotonous bore.  The show features witless banter between the characters and plots that are so predictable that anyone over the age of 10 should figure out what's going to happen 5 minutes into an episode (finale included).  It follows such a dull, tired, calculated formula - six friends (tawdry Rachel, whiny Monica, airhead Phoebe, and the fully emasculated Joey, Chandler and Ross) living together in a posh NYC apartment, all mostly working menial jobs.  And we are to believe that they can afford this place on their modest salaries.  Welcome to the world of Friends, featuring a cast that looks like they walked out of a modeling agency - you can't ever expect it to enter the realm of plausibility, now can you?  Which is ironic, considering that the show's fans liken the characters to people that they know and talk about how they can really identify with events that occurred in the series.  Yeah - I'll buy that for a dollar!
Besides following a derivative formula, the characters have a trait that betrays their modest backgrounds - they all act like spoiled divas.  Seeing them in action, especially Phoebe with her dopey songs such as ""Smelly Cat"" and Ross (who always seems to be complaining about something) is enough to grate your last nerve.  To think that this show has been placed in the pantheon of great sitcoms such as All In The Family, Seinfeld, the Simpsons and Curb Your Enthusiasm is disappointing - the show isn't nearly as sophisticated, groundbreaking or clever as any of the aforementioned shows.  One episode of Season 10 is (no joke) completely devoted to Chandler and Monica forever moaning and groaning about how much they want to have children - how very stimulating that is.  I did happen to catch the finale of series, and the outcome (which I will not spoil, for anyone that's still interested) was exactly as I expected - the kind of feel-good happy ending that has always been associated with this series.  Call me a cynical pessimist if you will, but the format that this series followed (long bouts of crying and complaining expecting the worst out of a situation, only to be pleasantly surprised with the best possible thing happening EVERY TIME!) was just too hackneyed and artificial - for the life of me, I don't understand why people consider this show to be so true to life.
In summary: An unimpressive finale to a lackluster series, Friends - The Series Finale doesn't warrant all of the positive attention and conversation that it has generated.  Content with running the same jokes into the ground and following all of the expected themes, this more or less indicated that the writers/producers/actors were lucky to get so much mileage out of a show that was so devoid of wit or imagination.",1083888000,5,3047,4.838461538461538
2052193,5,B00020HAWY,"I don't really care what some people say, thier definatly entitled to thier own oppinion.  But I for one, am really going to miss friends.  I practically grew up watching this show, and I think it went out the same way it came in; beautifully.
Some people may not have appreciated the subtle little things that made this episode great.  Like the scene where they all left their keys on the table, that one moment of sentiment was almost too much!!  It really is an end to a landmark show.  Friends really has left it's mark on television. Alot of people did love this show, and those people out there who didn't like it can think of the most horrible things to say about it.  Good or bad, Friends is going to be a show that everyone will remember.
I can't wait to see what becomes of Matt Le blank's spinn-off ""Joey"".  It sure has some huge shoes to fill as the replacement for Friends, I just hope none of us are dissapointed.  I really think he can handle the job, he's not as dumb as you might think!!  He really is a great actor, and I'm glad he's the one who got the spinn-off.
Anyway, if you ask me, the way Friends ended was just perfect.  Sure, I wish there was still another episode on next week, but everything must end sometime.  I really enjoyed the show while it had it's run, but now I can remember it as a television classic.  I'm really going to miss it!!",1083888000,,1371,4.250965250965251

2052195,5,B00020HAWY,"Friends is a cultural icon.  It represents different things for different people.  For some of us, it reminds us of greedy actors and the superficiality of the world right now; for others, it's a show that reminds us of all of our friends and different things that have happened in our lives.  Most people watch television sitcoms for the latter.  Likewise, most people that write horrible reviews for shows/books/movies like Friends (that have absolutely no real reasoning behind their opinions), are people that either don't have any friends or don't have a life.",1083888000,,565,5.043010752688172

I am appalled at some of the posts for this DVD.  Why would people with absolutely no intentions of purchasing this DVD even visit this Web site to write a review?  Personally, I think this space should be reserved for honest consumers to have made a purchase and would like to comment on the item.
In my opinion, friends is predictable.  That is what makes the show so great though.  For most fans, we've spent the last 10 years watching this series, observing changes in the characters; they slowly become people and that is what good writing is about.
I would also like to add my two cents by saying that the series was great up until season five/six when everyone started changing (I.e., Chandler moving out to live with Monica.)  The show has been in a steady decline ever since and all the actors are almost 40 years old now.  As much as I'd hate to see them go, their ""youth"" years are over both onscreen and in this world.  I'm just glad they had a finally when they did before we all grew to dislike them.

2052199,5,B00020HAWY,"1994. Episode 1. You knew. You just knew. There was a feeling that there was something here. You didn't know what it was going to be, or how it would turn out, but it was there. 10 years later, as the curtain falls for the final time, you are not surprised that it has lasted this long, gained this much success and respect. It was there in the beginning. (...). The finale, coming off of much hype and publicity, is what series finales should be. I am being careful what to say as to not spoil anything for anyone. Of course, the whole world watched, so it might not ruin anything. The adventures of Ross, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, Phoebe, and Joey, are wrapped up in a satisfying send off that showcased the best of the show. It was truly vintage. Being a spoiler junkie, I knew what was to come, but most of it could of been figured out in advance. Loose ends were tied up and everything was wrapped up in a big red bow. Would we want it any other way?. The writing was superb and it handled the festivities as a classic episode, and not like other finales who try so hard to be something special and come off as feeling out of place and out of character. Not this one. It was vintage ""Friends"" through and through. With great little touches like Gunther's confrontation with Rachel, to the chick and duck homage between Joey and Chandler, the writers knew how to give it a little something here and there to touch upon the show's long and celebrated history. The foosball table scenario, disliked by some, was symbolic and overlooked and misunderstood by a lot of people. The same people who probably go after the show for no reason and never actually think beforehand. There was a surprise here and there, but quite frankly, big twists and turns isn't necessary. It would only seem forced and trite, when all you need for the big send off are the characters. The people and the story. That's all. The final moments were sad, and the leaving of the keys was symbolic, touching, and a nice little touch. The actors, some say over-paid and talentless, are, of course, very talented. No one else could be these people. Each with their own quirk and character. They do some great work in the finale. The new beginnings with the babies and the move were brilliantly downplayed by the writers, who knew that while these were special moments, the main focus were on the people themselves. The show could sometimes go for an easy joke, but is that a problem?. No. Like the show itself, the finale was funny, sweet, heartwarming, touching, smart, and comfortable. The show and these characters served the TV viewing audience in a way that the detractors cannot understand. All finales will be reviewed and ripped apart to analyze everything, and it will never satisy everyone, but for me, this one did. They served us well for 10 years, and they gave us a finale that we, and they, all deserved.",1083888000,,2890,4.538314176245211
2052200,5,B00020HAWY,"First of all, since this is supposed to be a review of the final episode, let me say that the finale kept the same high standards of writing and performance that we have come to expect from Friends during the past 10 years. In other words, it is a keeper. I recorded it last night but will probably buy the DVD since the price is so attractive.
Why has Friends lasted so long and been so popular? I expect it is because the characters, like most of us, were good and decent people with flaws. At different times I could identify with either Ross or Joey or Chandler. They gave us something to relate to and to laugh at. (And I don't mean to imply that if you disliked the show it is because you are not a good and decent person. It just means the show didn't rub you the same way.) It doesn't matter whether or not it was a true sit-com or a sit-soap or whatever label one wants to attach. The show worked. The ensemble cast had brilliant comedic timing and consistently were given good material to deliver. Will Friends make me forget Seinfeld, Frasier, Cheers, Mary Tyler Moore, Dick Van Dyke, or I Love Lucy (to name a few)? Of course not.

2052202,5,B00020HAWY,"Dear Amazonians,
(...)I think Friends is a groundbreaking and inspiring show.
Friends is the first sitcom to not focus on the ""American family"" in the traditional sense.  There are no married couples in this group of friends, just people finding their way through life and sticking together through the tough times.  Many aspects of true life are brought into this show in a convincing and heartfelt way.  We see the group growing up and closer together over the 10 spectacular years that this show was on the air.  How many other sitcoms aired for close to 10 years?  Not many.
For all you poo-pooers, don't bother taking space on this site to write shallow reviews.  We don't have time for your nonsense.
All the best, and Farewell to a wonderful show,

2052203,5,B00020HAWY,"There are some shows that come along and stay around for a long time, even after they say their final goodbye.  To me, this is one of those shows.
Personally, I love this show and although I'm sad to see it go, I think there is a point where everyone needs to accept that the characters have moved on and so should we.  Sure, I'll miss Thursday nights without it.
After watching the finale last night, I know this is one DVD I will want to buy and watch over and over again.  It wasn't the usual hilarious/laugh out loud show.  It did have a sense of being bittersweet.
If you like the show at all, buy the DVD to see how it all ends.  If you don't like it, leave us Friends fans alone and go find another show to criticize.",1083888000,,724,4.070422535211268
2052204,3,B00020HAWY,"I like ""Friends,"" but the series finale was nothing to write home about.  We all knew that Monica and Chandler were getting a baby, and the ""twist"" wasn't even that much of a surprise, at least to me (there HAD to be a baby twist, and what else could they have done?).  We also knew that Ross and Rachel had to get back together somehow, or else longtime fans of the show would have staged a coup and overthrown NBC.
The problem with the finale was that there were no real surprises.  The Bings became parents in the first 15 minutes, and the rest of the hour-long episode kind of dragged.  The reunion at the end wasn't all that impressive, and the rest of the episode was filled with ""filler"" material that wasn't all that funny.  Also, Phoebe and Joey were hardly featured at all in the episode, and the whole ""ensemble"" mentality of the show was kind of abandoned for the finale.
Overall, the final episode wasn't horrible, but I expected a lot more from a show that has given me so many laughs over the years.
I think it's brilliant marketing strategy to release this DVD five days after the finale airs on NBC, and people who buy the ""Friends"" DVDs will probably want to get this limited edition collectible.  However, the finale is airing again in two weeks, and if you plan on buying all the other seasons on DVD, you'll get this episode anyway, so keep that in mind before shelling out the extra cash for this edition.",1083888000,,1427,4.427480916030534

2052207,5,B00020HAWY,"The finale episode of FRIENDS, which aired on NBC on May 6th and is now available on Collector's Edition DVD, did not disappoint this loyal fan.  I've watched the show since day one, and like so many others, have come to love this sextet of NY pals.
With so much hype leading up to the finale episode, my fear was that the show would go the way of SEINFELD, whose finale was a big let down.  FRIENDS, however, stayed true to form.  While the show certainly had it's big moments, the writers and producers didn't try to fill every moment with huge events.  In some ways the finale felt like a regular episode, with funny situations and jokes (like the new chick and duck getting stuck in the fooseball table).  And that's a GOOD thing!
It was touching to see Chandler and Joey have their final moment together after years as roommates, talking about the happy times they had playing fooseball.  And of course they wrapped up that scene with one of their famous hugs!
Chandler and Monica's surrogate mother having twins--and a boy and a girl, no less!--was touching, although it seemed highly unrealistic that they came home with the babies practically MINUTES after Erica gave birth.  Necessary to speed the episode along, I guess.
And of course we all knew the big ending would be Ross and Rachel finally getting together!  The build-up gave us just enough tension to keep us on the end of our seats--Ross not being able to admit how he feels, Gunther finally telling Rachel he loves her (that was sweet), Ross and Phoebe going to the wrong airport, Rachel boarding the plane the first time...up to the moment when Ross's answering machine cuts off Rachel's message!
But the moment Rachel walked into Ross's apartment saying, ""I got off the plane..."" was priceless!  It's what we've waited for for the past ten years, ever since the pilot episode when Ross (after pining for Rachel since high school), tentatively asked if he might be able to ask her out sometime.  In the finale, they finally declared that they love each other, were done messing up their relationship, and wanted to be together forever.  It was a classic moment when Ross joked, ""Unless we're on a break.""  EXCELLENT!
The subtle final moments of the episode were a perfect fade out...all six of them leaving their apartment keys on the counter, and walking out to go down to the coffee shop one last time.  Of course, Chandler got in one final joke, asking ""Where?"" when Rachel suggested getting a cup of coffee.

2052209,5,B00020HAWY,"Ask someone about notable series finales, something that is often attributed not to quality but hype, and chances are that MASH, Seinfeld, and Friends will top the list. The MASH finale, of course, remains the highest-rated episode of TV ever (unless Friends tops it). The Seinfeld finale ranks highly due to it's overwhealming hype (and it's failure to live up to it).
Friends, however, has something going for it that Seinfeld didn't have - it didn't try too hard to be the best thing ever. By the time Seinfeld's last episode aired, the hype surrounding it was so huge that nothing could have possibly lived up to it, and the fact that it was at best a mediocre episode didn't help.
Friends took the MASH route, and instead of attempting to top everything that came before it, simply aimed to tie up the loose ends that had been hanging since the beginning of it's 10-year run. The result, while by no means the funniest episode, and probably not the most romantic or the epitomy of any other description of the show, resulted in something that, unlike the endings to many shows, (and movies) actually feels like a real good-bye.

Maybe the characters were a bit shallow, but that doesn't matter, everyone can find something they like in this show. Why does it always have to be ""deep"" for some people? Sometimes the little things that aren't as deep can be very beautiful, you just have to open your eyes. You can find true greatness everywhere, it doesn't depend on the book/movie/series but on the reader/viewer. Things that are big and ""hyped"" aren't always bad. Some things start small and become loved by many people, maybe there are people that don't like Friends, that's okay, but you can't say it's not a good show, 'cause when millions of people worldwide are loving it, it has to be someting special.
But that's just my opinion.

And at that same time Ross' sister Monica (Courteney Cox Arquette) is in the hospital with her husband Chandler (Matthew Perry), when Erica (Anna Faris) is in labor. And she gives birth to a boy, but what neither Chandler, Monica or Erica knows there is another baby yet to be born, but the doctor delievering the baby knows. And Erica thinks the 2 heartbeats are her's and the baby's. And the 2nd baby is a girl, which they name Erica. But the rest of the friends doesn't know that there are two babies, nad had made signs for one baby. Just what to see the look of thier faces when they find out, which I am not going to spoil for you if you haven't seen the series finale yet.",1083801600,,1434,4.125

 - Ross' reply after his friends find out, from sister Monica, that he spent a summer with his Grandma while trying to be an aspiring dancer, in ""The Last One"", the finale to ""Friends"".
One of the best comedies of the 90's came to an end on 5/6/04 with the friends from ""Friends"" saying goodbye & moving on.
After the passionate night that Ross & Rachel had together, Ross isn't so sure that Rachel may stay in the U.S. & still head to Paris, once Ross confesses that he still loves her. Thru some convincing from the gang, Ross decides that if he doesn't confront Rachel & tell her his true feelings, he may spend the rest of his life wondering what would have happened if he did.
Monica and Chandler, with labor induced, surrogate mother, Erica, have raced to the hospital to become the proud parents their newborn child. But, a huge surprise awaits them. If you are one of the two people in the country who haven't watched the finale, I won't give it away here.
For Joey, he decides to get Monica & Chandler a housewarming gift that winds up in getting stuck in the foozball table.
I've always loved this show and it will stay with American viewers, as well as, the rest of the world, for a long time (I still don't get tired of watching the reruns). Much like that other great 90's icon, ""Seinfeld"", ""Friends"" is still funny whether your watching the show for the first time or for the one hundredth time.
Like ""The X Files"", & ""Seinfeld"", ""Friends"" will never truly say goodbye.
""Friends"" is here to stay.",1083801600,,1577,4.4567474048442905

2052220,4,B00020HAWY,"I would just like to say that I am also a huge fan of Friends and what many people complain about (the fact that it has soapie elements) is exactly what makes this show special. I have seen other sit-coms that were almost as funny as Friends but it was the lack of a story line arching over seasons that made them mediocre. And one more important thing: in one of the reviews there is a misunderstanding: someone writes that this will be the only DVD with the series finale. That is not true. The synopsis says that only this DVD will feature the BROADCAST version of the finale, so we can expect the Season 10 Boxed Set to obviously include the finale, too. So those of you who have 10 bucks, go ahead and buy it, those of you who do not, don't worry, it will come out in The Complete Tenth season. Only 17.5 hours left until the finale :)",1083801600,20,840,4.191358024691358
2052221,5,B00020HAWY,"This is by far the greatest show in television history.  Where I live, we get two half hour reruns per weeknight and we watch it every night.  It's just as funny the fourth or fifth time as it was the first time.  I own the first seven years on DVD and can't wait for the the last three years to be released.  I'm going to miss Friends and will probably suffer from withdrawals, but at least I'll have my DVDs when I need a Friends fix.  I hope the new show with Joey will be half as good and also last 10 years.  That would be great.  If you haven't seen Friends, you don't know what you're missing.",1083715200,14,600,4.033898305084746
2052222,5,B00020HAWY,"I don't have much to say, but this is my all time favorite show, and i LOVE the fact that they are coming out with this finale merchandise.  Its the best way to keep the series alive!  Its also a great retrospective because they included the pilot on this DVD, so you can watch the pilot and the last episode together...so sad, but so awesome!",1083715200,12,343,4.2615384615384615
2052223,5,B00020HAWY,"I am big Friends fan and am appalled that people who don't like Friends, are so judgemental over those who do. Well, guess what? I love my Friends' episodes no matter what you say and I think most of America would agree to that. I love ALIAS and Everybody Loves Raymond but as far as Friends go, I love them to bits simply because I've grown watching them and it is so unfair to say that other comedies have better acting because let's face it, most of us just can't stand to watch beautiful people to have acting talents as well. We just feel it's not fair, don't we. Well, they are a bunch of great comedians and though they are not that subtle and wise-cracking as some comedies are, they are great. This is entertainment and this is how it should be. Sure, 24 is great and all but that's a thriller drama, not a comedy. For those who gave this show a bad rating, stop being judgemental over those who love their Friends episodes because at the end of the day, we get our laughs, the stars get huge paychecks and you've got a frown on your face. Now is that pathetic of what!",1083628800,6,1078,4.237864077669903

2052225,5,B00020HAWY,"It's been ten years already and our six best friends are saying good-bye. Over the past ten years, we've watched these six actors grow into the huge stars that they are today and we will never forget them. Even though the show has to end, seeing it end is very heartbreaking because we've been watching it for so long. I, as well as the rest of the fans of this show, feel like that I've grown very close to the six actors. I know that we all can watch the re-runs at 6:00 and 7:00 on the WB mondays thru fridays and 7:30 on TBS mondays thru fridays. We can always watch every episode on our COMPLETE SEASON DVDs, but it's not that same as turning on NBC at 8:00 every thursday night to watch the new episodes.
  Over the years, we've had so many laughs from our most favorite characters, from RACHEL GREEN to MONICA GELLAR-BING to PHOEBE BUFFAY-HANNIGAN to JOEY TRIBBIANNI to CHANDLER BING to ROSS GELLAR. We've had so many laughs from Janice's annoying OH MY GOD's to Joey's HOW YOU DOIN' to Monica's, I KNOW, to Phoebe's SMELLY CAT, SMELLY CAT WHAT ARE THEY FEEDING YOU. Having to give all those things up is like giving up a part of our lives. When I tune on this thursday to watch my best friends bid their farewell, I'll be wearing black and most likely will have eyes that look like Niagra Falls. We all know that they'll be appearing in more movies, but no matter what movie rolls they take, those rolls will never compare to RACHEL, MONICA, PHOEBE, JOEY, CHANDLER, & ROSS.
  I just want to thank the six of you guys: JENNFER ANISTON, COURTENEY COX ARQUETTE, LISA KUDROW, MATT LEBLANC, MATTHEW PERRY, & DAVID SCHWIMMER. You have had a huge impact on all us fans. The six of you made my days when I was feeling sad. The six of you made my life a lot better than what it was before. I want to wish you all nothing but the very best of luck in your careers and where you take them in the near future. I hope to see you all in 15-20 years for a reunion. Again, thank you all for an outstanding show and may God Bless you all.",1083542400,18,2029,4.221649484536083
2052226,5,B00020HAWY,"...that they are releasing the final episode on DVD just a few days after it airs.  Not that I am complaining...I just never saw this before.  I am a huge Friends fan and I look forward to this special release.  For those that are still wondering if all 10 seasons will be released, well, they will be.  If you need immediate proof, click the 'United Kingdom' link at the bottom of your Amazon.com page.  Then, search for 'Friends' DVD.  You'll see that 9 seasons have already been released.  Great news for ALL Friends fans.  By the way, 2 million dollars per 30 second spot during the final episode?  Hmm...I wonder if they'd accept credit cards.......",1083369600,7,654,4.6173913043478265
2052227,5,B00020HAWY,"Hi I am a huge fan of Friends. I understand there are some who do not enjoy the show, but come on. Overrated, PLEASE!! This show may not have always been number one but in the ratings it has always been in the top ten (since the begining). We know it had to end sometime but it truly is the end of an era. This is a great show to follow.",1083196800,10,337,3.76056338028169
2052228,5,B00020HAWY,"First I am amazed at the lack of a life some people obviously have that they take the time to write a negative review of a show they obviously do not like.  Why would they even be looking up Friends on a search in the first place.  Sad people living sad hollow little lives indeed.
Is the series overrated? I don't think so.  It's solidly written and performed.  And in 10 years fondness develops for the stories and characters.
So why then would one bash it?  Well, it is not realistic in any stretch.  The NYC setting isn't portryed realistically.  Probably since the show is filmed in Hollywood. That has been a complaint from the beginning.  But when you take that out and just look at the writing and acting, and then look at almost every other show around today, you see why it has withstood the test of time.  It works. It is fantasy and not to be taken as reality.  So as a form of escapism -- which a sitcom should be by definition -- this is a crown jewel in television history.
Did it break new ground like ALL IN THE FAMILY and MASH?  No.  Did it present itself as overblown pretention like SEINFELD? No.  Did it retread a stand up comics limited routine like HOME IMPROVEMENT?  No.
It took 6 twenty somethings through the 1990s to present, showing them become thirty somethings in a fictionalized world that was no different than the I LOVE LUCY and OZZI AND HARRIET fictionalized look at the 50s and 60s, or the COSBY and FAMILY TIES view of the 80s.
It will stand the test of time just like those others just for those reasons.",1083196800,15,1542,4.364912280701755
2052229,5,B00020HAWY,"It started in 1994 and it has evolved into something so great. FRIENDS is something that can never be forgotten. The series was about the lives of 6 friends, Rachel, Ross, Monica, Chandler, Phoebe and Joey....
Many years passed and the characters changed. Monica and Chandler fell in love and got married. Ross and Rachel, Were together, broke up, Ross still thought of getting back with her, they got drunk and married, divorced again andseven had a child later..............but who knows what might turn out of the two in the last hour of FRIENDS. Phoebe went through many things and then got married to her Boyfriends Mike. Joey is still Joey...
After these ten years of Laughter, tears and surprises, there will be nothing harder than to say good bye to the series. May 6th will be a legend after the last two hours are shown.......... Capture the legends in this DVD with the start and the end!
A must-buy DVD for 2004. Don't only buy this, I would suugest you to buy the whole series' season 1-10 as well............I know I will.",1083110400,,1036,4.666666666666667
