8247912,4,B0012UKLCE,"I remembered these fairy tales from my childhood.  We had the VHS tapes when I was little, and I was hoping to have the Pat Morita narrations between the stories.  It was disappointing that this feature was missing, but all the same, I absolutely loved that I could find these.

I'm a fan of comparative storytelling, so I love that there are three versions of the Rumplestilskin myth side by side.  This collection includes the Brother's Grimm version of Rumplestilskin (European), the tale of St. Olaf and the Troll (Nordic), and the story of David and the Name of God (Jewish).  Tracing the common threads is great fun, and I was pleased with the quality of the video.  For such a cheaply made DVD it played extremely well and there were few video flaws (aside from the low quality).",1339027200,3,786,4.618705035971223
