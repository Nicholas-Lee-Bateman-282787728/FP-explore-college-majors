5824438,5,B00DK2NS2W,"So what would happen if you took Lucky Star, and replaced the otaku references with yuri? You'd end up with something close to Yuri Yuri. Perhaps not a perfect comparison, but if you liked the random and irreverent humor of Lucky Star, you might like Yuri Yuri. One could also compare it to a few other shows, like Nichijou. As the title of the series gently implies, there is a bit of yuri in Yuri Yuri, so beware if that is not your thing. Lots of slapstick, moe girls sitting around doing (or avoiding doing) homework, lots of running gags and so on. Even the background music, which is something that, well, typically falls into the background, is well done.

There are two seasons, altho the second season feels like it toned down the yuri content, it is still just as good.",1400630400,,779,4.485915492957746
5824439,5,B00DK2NS2W,"when it comes to the group of girls slice of life comedy, there's a lot to choose from.  Lucky Star, K-On, A-Channel, and SO much more.  In all honesty though, Yuru Yuri is the best of the entire genre.  While the other series do a good job just portraying cute girls doing cute things, while occasionally being funny, Yuru Yuri is consistent.  They are throwing jokes at you at least once a minute and the majority of them hit bullseyes!  The characters are clever and work off each other very well.  I almost want to say that the writing in this series is what stands out the most, but the characters are also incredibly memorable, even the side characters.  The animation is beautiful and the attention to detail is fantastic.  This IS the best of that this genre has to offer.  it's fun, cute, smart, hilarious, and I forgot to mention, the music in the series is great as well!  Can't wait for season 3!",1387152000,8,908,4.448484848484848

8594074,2,B00DK2NS2W,"I'm giving this a 2 star rating solely based on the awful translation work that was done, classic NIS America ruining jokes and adding slang that doesn't exist in the Japanese language in. A literal bootleg I bought years ago had better translation.

Seriously changing something like ""pantsu"" which You can literally hear to ""undies"" is just flat out dumb. You aren't targeting some mainstream crowd, step up Your game, this series is heavy on dialogue based comedy and when I sit there just reading and noticing all these mistranslations and or unecessary changes My enjoyment is ruined. Thanks but I will likely be returning this Blu-Ray, I take translation very setiously and simply keeping the tone is not good enough.",1521676800,,723,4.975206611570248
8594075,5,B00DK2NS2W,Loved it! Comes with two bluray discs and a chapter guide. For those who are not able to buy the limited edition this a great choice for fans of Yuru Yuri,1465084800,,154,4.0
8594076,5,B00DK2NS2W,"Love this show! I bought both seasons and I have to say, I do not regret it. (FYI: I spent over $160 for both Blu-ray Editions). I gave this anime a review on season 2, but I feel like that wasn't enough. Do not be judgmental about the name ""Yuri"" being in there. IMHO, I feel like it's more leaning towards Slice of Life/ Comedy. It does, however have SOME Yuri moments, but it's really manageable. The Yuri really only comes from the fantasies from a couple of girls. Again, I say ""Fantasies"", not Reality. Funny. If you feel less than 100% sure of buying it, it is on Crunchy Roll. I watched there and felt compelled to buy it. IMHO, the Yuri comes off as Hilarious more than anything.",1454457600,2,688,4.3
