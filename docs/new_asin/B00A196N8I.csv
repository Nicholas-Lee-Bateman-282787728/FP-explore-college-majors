5374849,5,B00A196N8I,"First of all the print is first class. The plot about Wayne picking up the badge to save churchgoing citizens from the tyranny of the saloonkeeper and his henchmen is a classic and the film balances somewhat between being an a- and a b-western. First of all it is a b-western though. There are lots and lots of fine action, Walter Richmond is a favourite mean and venomous villain and Al Bridge plays a touching role as a good/bad guy. Many other great actors for instance Earl Dwire and Glenn Strange give us brilliant entertainment. The many, many minutes long showdown shootout finale is amazing. No doubt about five stars!",1360627200,6,626,4.7

5374851,5,B00A196N8I,"The New Frontier, 1936 film

In 1890 Wyoming powerful forces (the cattle barons backed by NY financiers) opposed statehood and started a reign of terror to drive out small ranchers and homesteaders. [The movie Shane was another example.] The US Department of Justice sends operatives to Crockett City to ensure an honest election. John Tipton sees a runaway carriage and stops it. A gang at the border drives away homesteaders. Tipton prevents that carriage from being turned back. Carter is the new owner of the local newspaper. [The Committee of Law and Order was often the Vigilante group.] Publisher Carter is for statehood, the Crockett City Blade will oppose those against it. He is warned about powerful forces; the last editor was shot.

One government man sends a coded telegram, but that identifies him. The two men of the gang attack Tipton but they are defeated. A dead man is brought in, shot in the back. Who is he? How does the gang know about gold shipments? Some gang members are paid to go away. But they are stopped by the City Marshal and Tipton. An old trick gets a confession from one. There is a fight outside, and one man shoots the editor in the back - an accident says the jury! Miss Janet will run the newspaper. The gang plans to knockover a wagon load of silver. But they are surprised! A bunch of cowboys rider into town, shooting their pistols. [No laws against this.] Tipton is kidnapped and tied up. But he hears their plans and later escapes through a window then rides away quickly!

Tipton and the Government operatives are told to gather up the honest men. In Crockett City the polls are closed early to control voting. There is a posse of small ranchers and homesteaders coming, and they are armed. Can they be kept away by barricades? There is a lot of shooting. One man throws dynamite to destroy a barricade, the good guys ride into town. Does Steel know too much? Tipton climbs from a window of the Custer Hotel and stops the gang leader. The early returns show a complete victory: Wyoming will become a state! Tipton hugs Janet. The people triumphed with help from government men. [Was this the first Integrated Western (with colored folk)?]

The new state of Wyoming was the first state to allow women to vote - in state elections. This is one of the many movies that were inspired by the events known as the Johnson County War. The cattle barons hired cowboys from Texas to drive out small ranchers and homesteaders so they could grab their lands. The plan was to shoot the Sheriff and some County Commissioners then range over the county. But the people had been warned and gathered in a posse and hemmed in the gunmen until the US Army came to rescue the gunmen. You can read a history book on  this event, they won't teach this in high school or college. One editor, A. S. Mercer, was driven out of the state but wrote the definitive book The Banditti of the Plains.",1426636800,,2914,4.585412667946257

5374859,3,B00A196N8I,"This review applies to all of the Republic John Wayne B westerns released so far by Olive Films. I love B westerns and Olive Films is to be commended for bringing us these John Wayne B's in such pristine quality, even in Blu-ray if you desire. However at running times seldom exceeding an hour they should be presented as double features as this type of material has been since the earliest days of Beta & VHS tape (remember those early Nostalgia Merchant releases). List prices of $20-25 are just too high for single B features, even if ""the Duke"" is in them! More and more you are seeing double, triple and quadruple recent and classic ""A"" product on one or two discs for $10 to 20, no reason at all to be gouging us B western lovers for these. Double feature them and I'll buy them all Olive Films! As single features, sorry but not worth it!",1376006400,,845,4.388535031847134
8545962,5,B00A196N8I,"This is one of many fine Wayne Westerns from 1935. It has the typical good guy vs. the outlaw gang element, but throws in some interesting twists to the familiar plot. At times, this feels like a predecessor to Wayne's movies for Howard Hawks, with the trapped, outnumbered sheriff finding help from unexpected sources. There's an fantastic, fiery climax to the movie that really must have been a challenge to pull of in '35. This one should be readily enjoyed by any fan of John Wayne's later work.",1514592000,,499,4.681818181818182
