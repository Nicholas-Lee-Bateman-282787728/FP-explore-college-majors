4858724,4,B005QIOK52,"This is my 3rd purchase of Billy Blanks Tae Bo DvD's. I rated this one 4 Stars for the following reasons:
1) This workout was much more difficult than his ""This Is Tae Bo"" workout. Beginners Beware! this one will leave you crawling on the floor gasping for air and water.
2) Cardio Explosion doesn't fit some of the exercises. At the end of this video he does some machine gun sidekicks. Not exactly an ""EXPLOSION"". I viewed an Explosion as an intensity, Hard punching not fast punching, Hard solid form kicks not machine gun kicks.
3)***Observation**** He added stretching at the front and back of this DvD. I am now very used to doing my own stretching routine and then turning on the DvD ready to go. I was let down a little to find out he added that so now I did 2 rounds of stretching.
4) Few things I like: The combination of kicks, Doing speedbag while jumping, the hammer fist exercises, the Backfist exercises.
5) Things I dislike: Stretching front and back of DvD, Jumping jack Punches, Machine gun sidekicks, Leg lifts were way too fast and some exercises were way too fast.

I like this DvD but I was a wee bit disappointed. I'll keep it in my library though. The workout is a bit shorter due to the stretching at the front and back of the DvD. I purchased the ""This is Tae Bo"" DvD and I like it the best. I'll Flip Flop these 2 vids to keep it mixed a bit.",1327363200,2,1369,4.285714285714286
4858725,5,B005QIOK52,"I am in the process of losing over 100 pounds. 40 pounds into my journey, my wife bought this DVD.  It is challenging, but it is fun and rewarding. It took me a couple of times to get the moves down, but like with anything, you can catch on the more you do it.  The secret is control and form while doing the moves.  That's where the workout comes in. Billy is easy to follow, and somehow, he is very encouraging and motivating.  I thoroughly enjoy it and look forward to using it on a regular basis.",1326326400,11,500,4.123711340206185
4858726,5,B005QIOK52,"This is the first Tae Bo I have done. I am not an ""exerciser"" by nature and I despise running. My family started losing weight in Oct. 2011 and after Christmas got this video. We had been walking and doing Billy Blanks Jr. Jr's Dance With Me Cardio is fun, but Sr is fun and works up a sweat. I like that he and his team count. And, I like that he says ""one more time"" when there are about 3 more sets left. He does a good job of getting most of the major muscle groups and works on coordination. The only (minor) complaint I have is there is not enough time devoted to stretching the legs at the end, but I can do that on my own.
I will add...the first time I did this I was not able to keep up with the choreography, but every time I do it I get better...so if this is new to you, keep at it.",1325721600,2,794,3.8181818181818183
4858727,5,B005QIOK52,"Normally I don't review a lot of my purchases, but I wanted to for this DVD.  I have lots of Tae Bo DVDS and sets, AMPED, PT 24/7, etc...  I think Tae Bo is a lot of fun and it makes me want to workout.  This video is probably the most balanced of all the Tae Bo videos, generally I find a lot more upper body/core vs. lower body.  There is the perfect balance of upper body/lower body exercises focusing on the core.  One of the biggest complaints I see people have with these videos are Billy's cueing/counting.  I think the cueing was really good, as well as the counting of sets.  During the PT 24/7 videos especially, Billy will say last set and then you notice 4 more sets have gone by.  When he says 2 or 3 more sets in this video he is right on. There are great combo moves and transitions in this one.  I enjoy all my Tae Bo videos, but this one stands out for a total body workout.",1323907200,123,891,4.045714285714285
4858728,5,B005QIOK52,"This is one of Billy's newest workouts. It's one of my new favorite workout DVDs. It's a great and intens Tae Bo cardio workout. You realy feel the burn! I think it's not for beginners. You will sweat a lot. Do this workout three times a week and you are in great cardio shape.
I give five stars for this wonderfull workout.
Good job Mr. Blanks.",1322956800,26,345,4.242424242424242
4858729,5,B005QIOK52,"I am not quite sure why this is pre-order December 6th when i stumbled upon it at my local target today. But anyway, in the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of the work out i was breathing heavy and sweating, and i do workout 4-6 days a week. When using his combination techniques of punching and kicking you work your triceps, biceps, abs, inner, and outer thighs. You start doing the rep at normal pace then you go into ""explosion mode"" where you kick up the energy and really  get your heart rate up. In the land of Jillian, Bob Harper, and P90X this will defiantly go into my workout regimen for sure. Though, not needed because this workout is powerful on its own, i will be adding 1-2 pound weighted gloves just for the extra push. Love this workout!",1321833600,57,764,4.3426573426573425
4858750,1,B005QIOK52,"I haven't done Tae Bo since the VHS days and gave it a try again. This DVD moves so fast I can't keep good form on the explosion moves.

I recently bought the Tae Bo Cardio dvd and remembered why I love these so much!

4858777,4,B005QIOK52,"If you like Tae-Bo, this is a worthwhile DVD. I watched on YouTube before purchasing. The production is better than previous DVDs which is nice. You don't notice bad production until you see it in some older Billy Blanks DVDs. Also, the cues and counting have drastically improved as its left to Shelly and others to keep count, not Billy. Of course, there is one instance of Billy being on a different pace than the class, but one small gaffe, again, big improvement over older DVDs of his. If you like Billy Blanks and a solid but not strenuous workout, you should like it.",1439424000,,575,4.538461538461538

Like the 90's workouts all you need is the basic foundation for kicks and punches, and yourself.  This workout is good for someone who's ready to move past basic workouts (the 20-30 minute workouts) or someone who's been practicing Tae Bo for some time.  I was pleasantly surprised by the inclusion of a block and strikes along with punches and kicks. I did miss having demonstrations of how to use new the block and strikes, perhaps something I will find other workouts of this vintage. Overall a great and even (even sets on the left and right sides) workout and instructions.",1419292800,,718,4.6299212598425195

The group that works out with him on the DVD is motivated and their energy helps me push myself for maximum results. I love the fact that I am working my core without getting down on the floor and doing the old fashioned boring sit-ups.

Between some old Walk Away the Pounds VHS tapes, Billy Blanks VHS tapes and a McDonald's cardio workout DVD he had been rotating over the past year, my son has lost nearly 100 lbs and reduced his cholesterol count by nearly 100 points. The tapes are now worn out and needed replacing. Being mildly autistic, we have to keep an eye on him or he will do all the workouts at one time and overdo it. At this point in time he is having a good time with them and doesn't collapse in exhaustion at the end of the workouts. The next step is to add some light weights or weighted gloves for his hands.",1389139200,,690,4.156716417910448

I get bored waiting for Billy to move at a faster rate while he gives the beginner the opportunity to learn the move.  In this one Billy moves much more quickly.  I do recommend, though, that you start with a different one if you're a beginner or you could get lost in the moves.  I don't like that he has some floor routines as I do my workout from my lap top and can't see the screen from both standing and on the floor.  I would recommend this although it's not my favorite.",1387238400,,557,4.12037037037037

4858840,4,B005QIOK52,"Billy Blanks: Tae Bo Cardio Explosion is a workout session that is comparable to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Billy-Blanks-Tae-Bo-Advanced/dp/B009B82FUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Billy Blanks: Tae Bo Advanced</a>&nbsp;in the sense that it is filmed in the same studio with the same smaller group of participants.  Tae Bo Advanced is a longer workout; it is slightly more intense and does not include a warm-up.  Together, these two sessions complement each other and can be used alternately.  Both DVDs feature some jumps and push-up moves that make the workout a bit more intense than Billy's usual kick and punch sequences.

Tae Bo Explosion advertises a 67 minute exercise program and while, yes, the entire video does have over 60 minutes of feed, it includes the Tutorial portion time in its overall length.  The actual Cardio portion is around 52 minutes; this includes a warm-up, cool-down and Billy's usual motivational words.

The music on this workout is comparable to that on the Tae Bo Advanced (Please, do not confuse ""Advanced"" with the original Advanced workout that came out in the 1990s or the Advanced Live sessions) DVD-its muted, computer generated and fairly paced to keep your heart rate moving.  Of course, Billy does introduce each of his sequences at the slower pace and then ""explodes"" into his faster cardio rhythm.  For the most part, he keeps both sides exercised and does not include any awkward sequences that break the momentum.

On the whole, you will get out of this workout what you put into it.  If you concentrate on Billy's instructions, and focus on your body while you perform each of the moves, fast or slow, you will find yourself perfecting each kick and punch and working the parts of the body intended.  If Billy's slow moves are too slow, you can pick up the pace yourself by lifting your legs more.  When he halts the movements slightly by getting a little too motivational, just run in place or do jumping jacks to keep your heart rate up.

This workout contains no floor work other than a few plank moves that evolve into in place runner's sprints.

Bottom line?  Tae Bo Cardio Explosion is a good 50 minute workout which includes a good beginning stretch and cool down.  The pace is adequate. Use it in conjunction with other Tae Bo DVDs for variety.  Wish Billy would bring back his original 12 Advanced Live Workouts--the music on these sessions were great, motivational and upbeat.  Recommended despite the tinny music.

I really cannot put my finger on why I did not like it as well but I just did not feel like I got as good of a workout as I do with older dvds like the Taebo Ripped series.  I think it has something to do with the flow and I never found myself just getting lost in the zone of doing cardio at high but not too high level so that you get lost in the work (like when you are driving and realize your that I are at your destination and forgot how you got there) like with the earlier workouts.

I've been doing P90X videos off and on for several years and was getting really bored with them. For those familiar with P90X, I would say this workout is roughly the equivalence of Kenpo X, in terms of intensity. If you're looking to add some variety to your workout library, this is a pretty decent choice.

Others say it is not for beginners, and I agree.  I wouldn't start off with this DVD if you are new or returning to exercising even though there is a tutorial section.  I would recommend This is Tae Bo for a beginner.
The one thing I do like about the DVD is that it offers a change if you don't feel like doing all traditional Tae Bo.  Billy implements other types of cardio such as jumping jacks, burpees, and mountain climbers.
I'll do this workout every now and then just to mix it up with my other Tae Bo videos that I have.  I have been doing Tae Bo for a while, but this is still a heart-pumping and sweat-inducing DVD nonetheless.",1375920000,,798,4.122580645161291

4858875,1,B005QIOK52,"I recently rekindled my love for Billy Blanks and his Tae Bo workouts when I purchased a DVD (Tae Bo Express) on a whim because I was finding it difficult to make it to the gym in between school and work. THAT DVD was a success and reminded me why I used to LOVE Tae Bo in the late 90's. So it was a big disappointment when I got this DVD in the mail, excitedly put it in my DVD player, looking forward to a great workout, and then realized  I wasted the 5 bucks it cost me to order it. The problem with this DVD is that it lacked the intensity of a good cardio workout because Mr. Blanks spends far too much time doing the move in slow motion so that the viewer can get the move down, before launching into the cardio bursts. It seems that since all of the workouts are in the DVD format now, it would be simple to provide an option on the menu to teach the moves to people who are not familiar with the workout. That way, there is no time wasted to slow down and master the move. Why they have not done this yet, I do not know, as I have found this to be a problem with many of the Tae Bo workouts I have bought over the years. My experience with this workout was a much welcome rise in heart rate and the start of a good sweat--to be inevitably followed by minutes of low intensity workout to bring me back down, which I found extremely frustrating. I found myself having to do burpees, mountain climbers, jump squats, etc. to keep myself in a cardio zone. So, for those who are new to working out, or just not looking for an intense cardio session, this may be the one for you. You can get your blood pumping without overexerting yourself. For those who work out regularly or are looking for a good, cathartic cardio exercise experience, which is what I am after in my cardio workouts, I would not recommend this.  I am not giving up on Mr. Blanks, however, and I'm hoping he will come out with a cardio workout so intense I have to imagine myself on a beach in Hawaii in order to get through it. These are the workouts I love. Or maybe he already has, and I just haven't found it.",1364083200,6,2085,4.095354523227384

It is about an hour (I fast forward through the slow stretching at the beginning and end to save time).  The cardio is the perfect impact making the work out challenging yet fun.

I purchased Billy's Bootcamp and Taebo Live but nothing compared to the original. This video is perfect - a great combination of kicks, punches and cardio. Just love it. The hour goes by so fast too, and it's just long enough to do while my daughter naps. I like that there are a couple seconds between the sets where you can catch your breath. The great thing about it is that you can make your own pace too. If you want to ""explode"" constantly, the tempo is there, if you need to slow it down a bit, you are still on beat.

That incorporates weights. But I get bored, so looked for something else. I don't know if my mind was somewhere else? I will have to try this again.

I read a few reviewers on this Cardio Explosion DVD who said this was too easy also; so, I was a little skeptical after ordering. I was wrong. For a guy in his mid-40s it was tougher than these reviewers stated - well tougher for me. Learning some of the choreography just takes a little time, but that's how life is anyway. I enjoyed it and found it to be challenging. Granted it's not ""Insanity"" but it is more challenging than Billiy's Elite Series.

4858888,5,B005QIOK52,"I workout 5 or more days a week (walking, Zumba, elliptical, Pilates), and this DVD kicked my butt. I couldn't do all the quick reps as fast as Banks and his crew, but I hung in there the best I could. My heart rate was up and I was really sweating, so I'd say this was great for calorie burn and muscle strengthening.

The full working is about 55 minutes: 5 min of active stretching at the start, 45 minutes of intense cardio kickboxing, and about 5 min of cooling down & stretching. The disc has a tutorial that I didn't watch, only because I have taken kickboxing and done older Banks videos before.

Advice: Work on getting the moves down correctly, especially the footwork, before you try too hard to do the quick ""explosion"" versions of the moves. It is more important that your body is in the correct position than it is do it quickly, or you risk injury. Also, be sure you can easily pivot on whatever surfacing you're working out on. You don't want your feet to stick and then twist your knees.

Lastly, I can't do floor moves that require supporting myself on my hands (wrist problems), so I just grabbed my hand weights and ran in place or did lunges/curls during those few moves. But most of the moves are not on the floor.

I do really like this DVD and will be using it a few times a week.",1356825600,3,1304,4.288617886178862

There are a few advanced moves that involves jumping, probably inspired by the Insanity craze.

4858893,5,B005QIOK52,This is opne DVD that delivered what i expected. Billy Banks knows how to make a workout fun while you are sweating it.,1350000000,,119,4.217391304347826
4858894,3,B005QIOK52,"I bought it based on the other reviews that said that it was for beginners but i was out of breath and i work out every day and i am not overweight either.
It is NOT for beginners, I have several tae bo videos, I like some more than others but this one is too hard for me.",1349740800,4,272,3.706896551724138
4858895,5,B005QIOK52,"I wanted a workout that was a little longer than the 30 minute ones I have at home. Saw that this was 67 minutes long in the information. However, the actual workout is only 52 minutes long (The other minutes must be from the tutorial). BUT...its a great fast workout. I will admit when they go for the 'explosion' part (meaning double time) it is very hard to keep form. I think that will come better as I get stronger.

The absolute best thing about this workout is we got to the end and I thought.. we are cooling down? Are we going to abs or something? That can't be almost an hour..and it WAS! This workout goes by SO INCREDIBLY fast - and THAT I love! LOL!!!

There is one section of burpees.. I can't do those due to a fused wrist bone, so I just did whatever else I could for that quick minute. Was glad to see that set of moves was the only one on the floor like that and didn't last long.

I really like it and the parts where I couldn't kept up I went at my own pace, if I couldn't do the double-time moves - I did them fast as I could - never stopped moving. All in all a really good workout that changes up so often that time passes quickly.

Awesome!",1349740800,3,1164,4.025974025974026
4858896,5,B005QIOK52,I've been loving this workout and already reaping the benefits after 4 weeks.  It's a great workout and it really kicks your butt- in a good way! I feel so energized after doing it and have enjoyed it from the very beginning.,1347235200,,225,4.357142857142857

4858898,1,B005QIOK52,"I LOVE Billy Blanks.  For years, my workout routine consisted of walking and Tae Bo and was in phenomenal shape.  I veered away from him and did traditional-style gym workouts for the past 9 yrs.  I decided to give Tae Bo a go again and bought this DVD.  NOT for people with any level of endurance.  I barely got a sweat and the short bursts with long breaks was counterproductive for a solid workout.  Basically, if you're able to run more than half a mile comfortably, I would say this video is not for you.  If you are recovering from an injury, have activity restrictions or are severely overweight, this would be a great addition to your DVD library.",1335657600,18,655,4.453781512605042

I used the original Tae-Bo VHS tapes and loved them, well along came dvd's and no more tae-bo vhs tapes for me.  Well, I started using lots of other dvd's, Jillian Michaels, Jackie Warner, Kettlebells and Zumba but I like to switch it up and then I happened upon these new Tae-Bo dvd's and I am sure glad I did.  This workout is a lot of fun and you feel like you have done something afterwards. I would definitely recommend this video to anyone!!",1335484800,3,597,3.9583333333333335

4858901,5,B005QIOK52,"this is a fantastic and challenging workout. i would say it's not for a beginner, but for someone who is already in decent shape and is looking for a challenging cardio workout that will get your heart rate up and make you sweat, this is a great choice.
my one complaint is that the woman in the front in the yellow top WILL NOT SHUT UP THE WHOLE TIME. it's so distracting.",1332979200,,373,4.194444444444445

This workout it truly not for the beginner.  I am intermediate in the workout area and this workout had me dripping in sweat.  I would highly recommend this workout for anyone looking to alternate their cardio routine.  The tutorial in this dvd is also very helpful, and this dvd is a good balance of upper/lower body exercises.",1332720000,,504,4.617977528089888

TAEBO kept me in shape years ago before having kids, and now I am back for more.  I am not a person to go to gym and get bored on excercise equipment, but TAEBO keeps me motivated.  I am extremely happy with my purchase and definitely recommend this DVD!  Thanks Billy ;)",1332028800,,396,4.012820512820513

I felt some of the ""explosion"" moves took away good form and actual power from the movement (like side kick). I like his cardio boot camp, although there are way too many slow spots in that one as well. I love TaeBo and Billy's energy and admire his devotion, but I need something more intense. I do, however, recommend TaeBo to beginners.",1484870400,,499,4.154639175257732
