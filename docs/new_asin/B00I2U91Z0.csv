6247375,4,B00I2U91Z0,I don't typically do these reviews but thought I'd give my opinion on this one.  Better than average gay flick and a thriller at that.,1398211200,4,134,4.36
6247376,4,B00I2U91Z0,"Caleb (Sean Paul Lockhart aka Brent Corrigan - ""Milk,"" ""Judas Kiss"") is in jail talking to Psychologist (Blanche Baker - ""Sixteen Candles"") about his online hookup and subsequent relationship with Jeremy (Rob Moretti - ""Crutch"" who also directed and wrote Truth). Told entirely in flashbacks, Caleb talks about their relationship, supposedly based upon honesty, and about his foster mother, brilliantly played by Suzanne Didonna (""Boy Wonder"" and ""Seduction)."" Her acting role was so disgustingly dark, disturbing and homophobic that I had to fast forward some of the scenes. They were just too troubling.

If you can make it through the first hour and 5 minutes of deception, ""in your face"" homophobia, internalized homophobia, mental illness, prescription drug abuse, and the stereotypical theme about how dysfunctional gay men attract only other dysfunctional gay men, you will be rewarded with a psychological thriller, hot love scenes (including a disturbingly erotic rape scene!), good acting by Lockhart and Didonna, so-so acting by Moretti (had he directed in fake tears for his own role it would have helped the torture scenes), horrible, non-existent acting by Maura Foley, and it will have you sitting on the edge of your seat until the surprising, unexpected and somewhat unrealistic, ending. At the end you may be asking yourself if what you just watched was ""real,"" especially after the thrown in Psychological term ""Brief Reactive Psychosis.""

The music is overdone and too loud in a few places (probably for some kind of dramatic effect) but it seemed to echo too much and some of the dialog, especially when Caleb talked to himself, was barely audible. What is way to obvious throughout this film is the built-in Andrew Christian Underwear commercials! Brent Corrigan is not shy about full frontal nudity and lots of frontal closeups of his ""Andrew Christians.'"" The tender romantic lovemaking was not however, distracting until the film started turning to its darker side and (obviously on purpose) included one post-coital ""fluid"" scene and later, the rape scene.

There is a cameo close to the end of HAWT Amsterdam actor Max Rhyser who played in 2013's ""Chaser"" about the gay BB community.

Beware men who bring flowers when you first meet for coffee and medicine cabinets full of prescription drugs!",1398124800,41,2321,5.214477211796247
6247377,2,B00I2U91Z0,"The only reason I gave it 2 stars and not 1 was Sean Paul Lockhart, His acting was relaxed and not forced, he made me believe what he was saying, and he was just the right amount of eye candy to pull off the character, other than that, nothing.  I will not say something stupid, like, ""it was the worst movie I've ever seen, and I want my money back, people who review like that just haven't seen many movies or they have been incredibly luck and just never seen bad movies before.  Rob Moretti let me down, bad directing but even worse screenplay, I mean bad.  Not a movie I would view more than once, although, there is full frontal of SPL, and He has a bod and a half.

6247388,5,B00I2U91Z0,"Remarkable original story that is emotionally engrossing and mentally draining, not the usual and predictable psychological suspense thriller that you've seen. The movie has a very dark side to it, which in the beginning is already predestined for a sad and unhappy ending. Characters portrayed especially the mother of Caleb jolted the living daylight out of me. I have not yet encountered a mother in so many films, not even Mommie Dearest, that is so insensitive and so mentally impaired in hurting her own flesh and blood. Players  acted out their roles excellently so realistically and Caleb is the protagonist you'd love when he is helpless and hate when he is so much in control. I believe that Jeremy's anguish is even worse than what Paul Sheldon (James Caan) went through at the hands of Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) in Misery. The poignancy of the emotions portrayed by Caleb and Jeremy in the movie is delicately highlighted by the effects of chiaroscuro, of the blending of lights and shadows. Indeed, Truth is a movie that is totally different from most other psychological thrillers.",1456876800,,1096,4.9890710382513666
6247389,5,B00I2U91Z0,I absolutely loved this movie! Sean did an great job. It was very emotional and intense. Some parts made me cry. Had real life situations in it.,1455580800,,144,4.37037037037037
6247390,4,B00I2U91Z0,I enjoyed this film. In all its triumphant tragedy I found myself aligning on the side of this poor kid who just wanted love and for someone in his life that would never leave. Is that too much to ask? I guess this film suggest what could happen when you don't tell the truth!,1450656000,,276,4.12962962962963
6247391,5,B00I2U91Z0,"Sean Paul Lockhart is definitely an actor on the rise I believe. Although this movie could have been a little bit better, I still think it's something worth while watching if there is nothing on. The plot is interesting. Some argue that the ending was terrible but it's all on what you believe. And if you just want to see some eye candy that is Sean, I'd get it. Would be cool to see him go mainstream sometime because I he's definitely got some talent in him. 5 stars go towards effort and the visual style of this indie film.",1448150400,,528,4.29

6247413,5,B00I2U91Z0,"First of all let me say, I've never seen any of Sean Paul Lockhart's other movies.  I've seen all of his films though. From ""Another Gay Sequel"" and ""Milk"" and ""Judas Kiss"" ""Triple Crossed"" and yes, ""Chillerama"". Not only is he a very handsome man (goes without saying) but I believe he has a genuine talent for acting. It is very obvious that he gives his heart and soul to any and all of his performances, this is no exception. Small budget doesn't necessarily mean bad and here is proof of that. This is basically a 2 man movie and both men are terrific. Rob Moretti, the co-star and director and writer and probably everything else is superb, too. But for me, ""Truth"" and that is what this is about, relies and the new and breathtaking emotions put out by Lockhart. I will continue to see every movie he makes. Bravo to all.",1416268800,3,828,4.411764705882353

6247431,1,B00I2U91Z0,"Part of the reason I watched this movie is because I know what Sean Lockhart does on his other day job ;} having said that here goes.  I read a lot of reviews all over about this movie and 99% trashed it, but knowing what many people feel about Sean I wanted to give this a shot and am I sorry I did. For starters the co star Rob Moretti who not only directing this movie but played a large role was not believable as the love interest at all, talk about wrong casting!  The movie starts off right out of the gate with these two meeting online, and then having a date which pretty much from there they go straight to bed together and its just a few scenes later where they are professing their love for one another which is ridiculous. After that the movie goes from bad to worse, the blonde guy can't take a hint that his boyfriend is a nutjob (he's got more pills in his cabinet than a Walgreens) he has more separation issues than anyone I have ever seen and so on.
Sean Lockhart was way over the top too, in so many place I would get carpal tunnel telling you what he did wrong. If your a fan of Sean and you want to see how good he looks then this is your movie, they really show how stunning he is and yes he is nude longer than I thought he would be.

Performances are great ! Sean Paul Lockhart has played a really scary psycho ! Lockhart is a very talented actor who gives the audience a performance as Anthony Perkins could.

Maybe I'm wrong and my bad understanding of Inglese certainly made me lose many nuances of the dialogue, but if I interpret the film, Emerges the concept of abandonment. The mother abandons Who has, in His Way, Caleb. The fear Caleb That Has to abandon the fear and letting go of love. The lack of of Jeremy Honesty with yourself, That affects with honesty towards others. And the abandonment of Jeremy against Caleb.
I can not express well the sentiment That Has Given this movie myself, but I find the sense of great loneliness of each character, loneliness Caused by the abandonment.
Maybe I said some stupid things, but have patience ... my Inglese is really bad!

6247453,5,B00I2U91Z0,I didn't know what to expect and I love suspense.. My heart was still pounding after the movie was over. I felt for Jeremy and even for Caleb. I couldn't stop talking about this movie... I loved it,1399248000,5,197,4.2105263157894735

6247456,4,B00I2U91Z0,This was a good movie . I was surprised that it has been given bad reviews. All the acting In most cases seemed believable . I LIKED IT!,1398816000,3,136,3.892857142857143
6247457,1,B00I2U91Z0,"I am so sorry I wasted money on this movie.  Very dark and violent movie.  The only people who  might benefit from seeing this movie are people in the mental health field..

One hole in the movie is when one character finds tons of medicine in a cabinet, but he doesn't ask about that?

The other character falls in love with the other and gives him a house key, but has never been to his home or meets any of his friends

I kept trying hoping it would get better towards the end.  It only got worse",1398729600,19,499,4.082474226804123
6247458,5,B00I2U91Z0,"No complaints.  Mr. Lockhart gave a well paced solid performance.
Production value, lighting, sound above most indies.
Not trying to nit pick, a nice well thought out effort.
I will recommend it to other folks.",1398729600,2,210,5.0
6247459,1,B00I2U91Z0,"The writer director obviously wanted write anything to SPL naked on the set. Watching the first 15 minutes is like being on a bad date, stupid dialogue, bad writing, the worst soap opera would be easier to watch..",1398211200,6,213,4.631578947368421

However, I have to award Truth two additional stars for the full frontal of Sean Paul Lockhart, which gave me my first look at what made him so successful as Brent Corrigan, porn star.",1482105600,2,282,4.549019607843137

8638386,3,B00I2U91Z0,"An okay film. They didn't resolve the conundrum sufficiently for my taste. When older and experienced meets younger and inexperienced how do you best address providing the experience and excitement of new things to a younger person when the older partner has 'been there, done that'. What is the effect on the relationship?",1473465600,,323,5.113207547169812
