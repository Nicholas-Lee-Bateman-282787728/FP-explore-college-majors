We see plainclothes policemen watching a suspected illegal operation at a meat market. Their call for backup goes unanswered. The crooks start a fire to destroy the evidence (drug smuggling). These police are criticized for their actions. There is a meeting of businessmen, two discuss a transfer of goods. The police checked those ashes, paper money was burned. Is Frank in trouble? His group is suspended because of the shooting. Can they plant a spy with Reece? The men play football at a family picnic. Later Lt. Frank gets a late night phone call and goes there with his friends. They find two bodies, their informant and a girl. One pursues a fleeing man. They find another body. Lt. Frank Daly gets the blame. Will he resign? Who will follow his example?

They raise cash by crashing into a house. They buy equipment from a fence! What will they do next? They watch a suspect and follow him. There is a speech about ""freedom fighters"" in South America. This group has press passes to attend and photograph this meeting. They find a man who can read lips. They learn about Noringer, who has an impressive resum. They see Army trucks entering Noringer's shipyard. They enter the warehouse and see drug smuggling and gun running operations! There are powerful and important people behind this operation. They gather bundles of $100 bills. They find an unusual place to hide it. ""They know its us!"" A man invades Linda's home and threatens her. Can they find a safe place? ""They told us."" What will they do with that money? Who was the last man to see Tommy?

Frank talks to Captain Torres about Tommy. This Captain will do anything to stop Communists. Frank wants a meeting with Noringer at Canyon Park. [Would they talk freely in front of the children?] They prepare for the meeting at this baseball park. ""Take care of yourself."" Noringer arrives in a helicopter with his bodyguards. ""Where's the money?"" There is a double-cross with a lot of shooting. There is an explosion as the police cars arrive. Another explosion to finalize the action. ""You should've kept the money"" says one policeman. There is a sort of happy ending. A White House politician speaks nice slogans (to show his hypocrisy).

This is an average action movie and morality play that was inspired by the Reagan-Bush scandals of drug smuggling and gun running in Central America. A better story would have made a better movie. The actual location for this operation was not Los Angeles but Arkansas. You can assume that Governor was involved in some way. Terry Reed's book ""Compromised"" has the uncensored details. Reagan's Attorney-General was forced to resign after they found unlaundered drug money in his personal checking account! The man responsible was later bumped off. Does anybody believe this policy was stopped? Afghanistan is a main source of opium and heroin. The British fought two wars in the 1880s to try to gain control of this lucrative trade. The Russians invaded Afghanistan in 1980 to break up the big landed estates that raised opium. Who is profiting from this drug trade today? Joe Domanick's ""To Protect and Serve"" must have inspired parts of this story about Los Angeles.",1339891200,,3208,4.837887067395264
