7931288,5,B000055Z07,"The buying experience was great.  I have no knowledge of the quality of the movie as this was a gift requested by a strange, reclusive friend who worships tonya.",1304899200,,161,4.551724137931035

Very suggestive.  Hemingway is warm in this one, could be hotter. Kind of a dull story really.  Invalid frigid wife, recurring nightmares, horn dog husband.  Tanya Roberts as the at home nurse with the most.  Interesting to watch if you like titilation but not much more here worth seeing unless you are a T. Roberts fan.",1213142400,8,497,6.358208955223881
7931290,1,B000055Z07,"This happens to be my favorite B-movie...mainly because Valerie Wildman is one of my favorite actresses. But you should all be warned...this DVD release is very poor. The picture looks like a warped videocassette, and the subtitles are laughably inacurrate. If you want this movie on an official DVD, order the version from Panorama Entertainment. You'll most likely have to order it from someone in Hong Kong or Japan, like I did, but it is worth it (it's hard to find now, but keep looking). It's an official Asian release. The picture is quite good (full-frame), and the subtitles are correct (optional English or Chinese). The cover is slightly different (I will add a customer image on this page) from the poor release Amazon is pushing. It's dark blue with Chinese writing under the title (in English). And it has a purple-ish warning label at the bottom, warning about explicit content. It is the unrated/uncut version of the film. The case says that it is region 3, but it is actually region 0 NTSC.

Update: I found a website that sells the good version I mentioned above. The DVD is still in print as of today (8-17-09). I can't give the exact URL on here, but the company is ""Play-Asia"". The catalog number of the DVD (if you want to look elsewhere) is ""PANDVD305032"".",1194739200,48,1279,4.709821428571429
7931291,2,B000055Z07,"Inner Sanctum is about suspicion, jealousy, adultery, and murder.  A woman suspects her husband of adultery and attempts suicide.  She becomes a hypochondriac invalid, and as her husband reluctantly cares for her, he continues to cheat with his secretary, leading his wife to suspect a murder plot.  He hires a nurse who was previously cleared of murdering her own husband to take care of her.

The acting is pretty bad for a ""mainstream"" movie, making it seem like an excuse for the excessive nudity and R-rated sex scenes, but the plot thickens and it's interesting to see if the wife's suspicions will bear out, and who is really trying to kill her.  Not for children.",1146096000,,671,4.8
