5993233,5,B00FID37KO,"Cathe's videos never disappoint.  I always feel very challenged whenever I do them  It is not for a beginner or intermediate but for those who want a challenge, I would highly recommend her videos.  This one was truly challenging but definitely a keeper.",1394582400,2,254,4.8604651162790695
5993234,5,B00FID37KO,"What a challenging workout. I only have a few minutes every day to exercise because I have a newborn. Cathe's program really pushes me. I like that I can pick which workouts I want to do, and I can make it as short or as long as I need to.",1394064000,,239,3.8
5993235,5,B00FID37KO,"I got this dvd in the mail today and couldn't wait to get started. I love the fact that I can do a 25 minute workout if I'm short on time or I could add more single x10 workouts if I had more time. I started with the step routine and man was it a workout! I have several other step dvds that are anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour long and I was sweating more on this one 10 minute step routine than I have with all my other step workouts. (And one of my step workouts is Cathe Friedrich-Basic Step and Body Fusion, which I love!) The warm up and cool downs are great and I can't wait to add this one in my routine. Thanks, Cathe, for another awesome workout dvd!",1389657600,3,664,3.925925925925926
5993236,5,B00FID37KO,"What's not to love about this DVD?  You have every type of cardio, from low impact on the floor to high impact on the step.  You also have workout lengths to suit everyone.  You can do a single X10 workout, or combine them.

Workout details:
Step - 26:12
Low Impact -- 24:56
Hi/Lo - 25:58
Cardio Blast - 24:38
Fat Burning Circuit - 28:53

Warm Up - 7:55
Cool down - 5:18

The premixes range from 36 minutes to 77 minutes and include the x10 sections in different combinations.

Here are my impressions of each section:

WARM UP

Pros:
Cathe is a master at warm up movements.  They are just enough to get your muscles warm and the blood flowing.

Cons:
The normal music track (with vocals) was very loud and it was hard to hear Cathe over the music.  This can be remedied by choosing just instrumental or just Cathe's voice. This would be a pain though, because you would have to do this every time you put the DVD in the player.

STEP

Pros:
It's tough! Your heart rate will definitely be up there.

Cons:
My joints didn't care for this section.  I particularly disliked the jumping on and off of the step with 4 risers.  Of course, I don't have to match Cathe's movements.

Cathe doesn't mention any low impact modifications.  I've done step long enough to know modifications, but it would have been helpful for Cathe to mention some.

LOW IMPACT

Pros:
This was my favorite section.  My joints certainly loved this part.  Maybe it's because I'm older and my joints can no longer take high impact.  I like to think it's because I've become better at listening to my body and knowing its limitations.

In spite of the moves being low impact, my heart rate stayed just as elevated during this section as during the other, higher impact sections.

Cons:
None that I can think of.

HI/LO

Pros:
The beat of the music perfectly matched the moves.  This really helps me to give it my all.
I didn't jump nearly as high as Cathe and crew, but my heart rate was up there the whole time.

The music tunes were recognizable to me, even though the words were different.

The Lo section (with weights) was tough!  Cathe uses 8 pound weights, but you can always go heavier or lighter as needed.  Cathe encourages you to use heavier weights once you get stronger.

The unusual moves, e.g. the upright row into a snatch.  It's always fun to do some different weight moves, after all how many ways are there to do a bicep curl?

Cons:
None.

CARDIO BLAST

Pros:
It was at this point in the workout that I started to admire Cathe & crew's purple workout shoes.  This distracted me from the `pain' of the workout.

This section was just as tough as Beachbody's Insanity workouts!

Cons:
Cathe doesn't offer any modifications, so if you need some, you should watch this section before doing it so you can be prepared to do your own lower impact modifications.

FAT BURNING CIRCUIT

Pros:
A true metabolic training workout, mixing cardio with compound move weight training.  Even though I did this section last, I felt a second wind and a burst of energy at this point.

Cons:
None.

NOTE TO SELF:
Do NOT attempt this workout the day after a leg workout like Lean Legs and Abs.  This is what I did the first time I did this workout and I was regretting it.

All in all, a great, fun workout that will get you moving and burning calories",1380931200,33,3316,4.439267886855241
5993237,5,B00FID37KO,"Fantastic!! This workout burned tons of calories and was very fast paced. It seemed like it was over before I knew it started.  I love the fact that I can get a full workout or use it as added cardio in segments on the days I am short on time or doing heavy lifting.  It does have jumping in segments but it also has low impact for those with joint issues. I know I will go to this workout time and time again!! Just what I was looking for!!

It is broken into about 25 minute workouts including warmup and cool down.  It contains one for step, low impact, Hi/Lo, cardio blast, and a fat burning circuit. You can either do one workout or combine multiple workouts. It does have premixes of combined workouts that make it quick to select. A perfect buy for a total body workout or a quick segment for a specific need.",1380758400,4,816,4.211538461538462
5993238,3,B00FID37KO,"I do not understand how none of the other reviewers caught this but the Cardio Blast says 24 minutes and it is only 10, also the Step Sections says 26 minutes and it is only little over 10 minutes as well.  I thought maybe I was losing my mind because I was timing my workout and it came time to stretch and I knew I had only been exercising for little over 10 minutes.  Don't get me wrong, I was happy because it was hard lol, but I plan my workouts around at least 30 minutes of Cardio and I was highly disappointed.  This has happened once before on one of Kelly Coffeys workout DVDs but I haven't run into this situation with Cathes yet, until now.  So after my workout I wanted to be sure I wasn't going crazy and I went through all sections, premix and chapters, all the same only 10 + minutes on each section listed above.  Even with the 7 minute warmup it's only 17 plus minutes so I don't know where they are getting their numbers from.
If one of the other reviewers didn't experience this please let me know, I honestly don't see that being possible because it led you into the end of the workout which is the stretch there was no cutoff like it was messed up.
Other than that it's a good workout they just need to list accurate times and I wouldn't have been misled to believe I was going to do a 25 minute high cardio workout as opposed to a 10 minute workout.  There is a much bigger difference in calorie burn.

Step - 26:12 (only 10 + minutes)
Low Impact -- 24:56
Hi/Lo - 25:58
Cardio Blast - 24:38 (only 10 + minutes)
Fat Burning Circuit - 28:53",1431907200,7,1561,4.1490066225165565
5993239,5,B00FID37KO,"There are some really great,short workouts on here! Really wish I had discovered this before wasting $ on the T25 DVD set. These workouts make me sweat buckets and I love that they don't take an hour or a ton of ecquipment-that is what turned me off with some of her earlier workouts. I also absolutely love her new Ripped with Hiit Low Impact DVD-it's in my regular rotation",1428796800,5,375,4.449275362318841

5993247,5,B00FID37KO,"Oh my Lord! This is one tough workout!! I am a huge Cathe fan and own almost all of her workouts; this is certainly one of the most intense. The beauty of this DVD is that you can do a 25 minute workout up to 77 minutes. There is also a variety of workouts included, fat burning, low impact, step, hi/lo. Due to my lack of coordination, I rarely do the step workout. There are multiple premixes that don't involve the step portion on this DVD. Even though I consider myself to be in great shape, there is no way I could do this entire workout all at once. I typically do three of the sections at a time. Minimal equipment is needed, and even no equipment for some of these. TIP: I use washcloths instead of slide and glide discs on my hard wood floors.",1420416000,11,752,4.157534246575342

5993250,5,B00FID37KO,"This is my favorite workout video (I do it 3x week). When I first started, the warm-up was enough intensity. After a week I was able to add a few minutes of the low impact. Every week I could add a few minutes more. Now I can do the warm-up, low-impact and hi-lo sections back to back. I like the cardio blast section too - I am working up to doing the whole section still. I have done the step section and it's a great workout, but my knee doesn't like it so much. I do modify a couple of the exercises. Cathe is a great motivator. The choreography is spot on, the music is good and there is an option for vocals only which I use so I can listen to my own playlists. I appreciate that there is no idle chit chat with the workout crew, this is a serious workout with many options to suit your individual tastes or needs. I also really like her core max video, which I do a 20 minute section 3x a week, her slide n glide and Afterburn video.",1416268800,7,940,4.00531914893617

5993257,5,B00FID37KO,"I did X10 for the first time today - and am thrilled to add this intense workout to my routine.  Cathe does give a lot of premix choices, which makes it easy to tailor the workout to your energy and schedule. Really, it can give you many different workouts on the one disc. X10 has a lot of HIIT plyo moves in it - some high impact and some low. The high impact are broken up with weight moves. I'm pleased to say that I paused the dvd 3 times to catch my breath - but was easily able to use a heavier weight than was recommended. There were only a few new moves - but some I was happy to see it again. Cathe added a lot of jumping jacks to this dvd, which I could appreciate. Jumping jacks tend to get left out in the tabata/HIIT workouts that now get preference. I was a tad disappointed not to have Cathe's bonus ab and strength segments added into the dvd - like in the last series. I guess I got a tad spoiled. If you want a workout that will raise your heart rate and push your limits - this is a great cardio workout.",1395014400,7,1024,3.970873786407767
8615887,5,B00FID37KO,"Cathe's workouts are so tough and I just love them! For variety, I rotate DVDs and do X10 about once every week or so and it's a great workout. (CrossFire, Afterburn and Ripped with HiiT are also some other favorites by her)",1528243200,,224,4.357142857142857

Not sure what happened.  I tried cleaning the CD thinking this usually works, to no avail.

I love that each segment is 10-15 minutes, I can just do a few or a long butt kicking full workout! I don't have the gliding discs but I just mimic the exercises without them and it's just find. You do need a couple sets of hand weights and a step if you want to do the step section.",1435881600,,388,4.0519480519480515
