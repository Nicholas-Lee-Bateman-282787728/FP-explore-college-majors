8643719,1,B00INMLW4K,"It was not the movie I wanted to see and own but some other using the same title/name and ripping off those of us who wanted the movie about a Nubian model who went back in time to experience. And witness what it was like to be kipnap, enslaved and taken on a ship to other countries by whites & europeans. It was a detailed account and so realistically done It was only shown in select movie theater back in 1993. Instead I was sold a boring video that told what the word Sankof a meant. Very disappointing and very deceptive and unfair practice. I rather give no stars for this purchase as it wasn't the movie I saw years ago under this name. So, please don't be trick as I and othersbwere , please read the reviews first!",1518480000,,724,4.215827338129497
