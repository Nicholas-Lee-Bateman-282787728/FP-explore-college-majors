1904424,5,B0000AC8LM,"If you don't care who won or if you are a Buckeye nut (as I am), this is one magnificent game, one of the best ever, partly because it was for the national championship.  On the other hand, if you are a Miami fan, this will make you shout, ""We wuz robbed,"" especially when you see a certain call by the officials, late in the game.

There were no sensational runs or passes--just good football, good defense by both teams.  There is one play I will always remember, when Miami intercepted a pass near the end zone and Maurice Clarett, a true freshman in his only season with Ohio State, actually stole the ball from the defense player for Miami.  Unfortunately, this was Clarett's grand finale.  Alas for what might have been.",1229385600,3,726,4.46969696969697
1904425,5,B0000AC8LM,"we all know that the call in the end zone in the first overtime was the worst call in NCAA division 1 history. Not to mention how terrible the call was, but how late it was as well. Did you also know that that back judge was born in the great state of Ohio? Kind of weird. the canes won that game just like the won the year before. Sorry the Ohio State team could have not won outright without the worst call in history that puts an * by their championship. They cant win the big game, they LOST that year in a close game. they lost vs Florida and they Lost again vs LSU. congrats on having a ""First Loser Dynasty"" in recent years",1200873600,,630,4.007936507936508
1904426,5,B0000AC8LM,"About a month prior to the game all I could remember was if Miami would beat Ohio State by more than they had defeated Nebraska in the previous Championship game. Allthe hype was Miami, Miami, Miami, 34 game winning streak and the only reason Ohio Stae was even playing Miami is that they were also undefeated and that they were barely getting by the opposition.

  True they had some close games they could have lost but those are the games you have to win to get to the big dance. The night of the game I was hoping, praying that somehow,someway Ohio State could keep it close,competitive make it a good game.

  I was not aware along with about most everyone else that I was about to witness one of the best games to have ever been played. Both teams started real strong on defense Both teams trademarks. Miami finally found a hole in Ohio States defense and scored a touchdown and it looked like de ja vue from a year ago, but wait this isint Nebraska from a year ago this is Ohio State give them a chance. They must have heard because other teams would have folded but not these guys. And while Ohio State had not fount a groove in their offense yet their defense was playing their guts out. Late in the first half Ohio State made a huge interception and on a gutsy forth and one call tied the game. A couple of plays later their defense came through again on a fumble and Clarett ended up scoring easily giving Ohio States offence a much needed boost.

  With eleven minutes to go in the third quarter Krenzel hit gamble for a big gain to the Miami five but a play later he was intercepted but Clarett with a great mind presence stole the ball from Taylor and ended up with a field goal giving them a ten point lead.

  You knew Miami was going to come back and tie it you just knew it. Theres no way Miami was going to go down like that. Sure enough Miami tied it and it was off to overtime.

  During the first overtime Miami scored pretty easily and it looked liked thier defense was fatiuged (do you blame them) from a long nights work. Ohio States turn in overtime didin't look so promising. After a penalty and an incompletion it was fourth and fourteen and all looked lost but with good protection Krenzel steps up and hits Jenkins for a big first down. Several plays later Krenzel throws on fourth and three to Gamble but he misses and all the Miami players were celebrating but as soon as they start to do so a penalty flag was thrown for pass inteference and while many people still cry about this call to this day I look at it this way,Miami had Ohio State down to fourth and fourteen and could not hold them thats what everyone routing for Miami should be crying about. During the second overtime Ohio State lookes a bit refreshed and scores. Ohio State gets to Dorsey but Miami still gets to the two yard line first and goal.

  This is where you find out how champions are made. Ohio State puts up one of the best goal line stances that I've ever seen and finally after 34 years they are National Champions beating the Invincible Miami Hurricanes proving that anything can happen as long as you believe in yousself and have faith in your teammates.",1153180800,10,3168,4.340677966101695
1904427,5,B0000AC8LM,"In the greatest college football game ever played, Ohio State made the plays at the right time to beat the ""unbeatable"" Miami Hurricanes in multiple overtime periods. This dvd is complete and without commercial interruption.

Some things to keep in mind as you watch the game. How bad has Keith Jackson's announcing skills faded? Heres a few quotes from oh nelly. Theres Craig Kressler the quarterback. He has  all of those stars on his helmet. Umm yeah.... Those are Buckeye leaves and his name is Krenzel not Kressler. What a drunk! Keith, buddy you have done about 30 Ohio State games in your career you should know that the logo is not a star, they aren't the Cowboys. Then you have his partner in Miami homer-ism Dan Fouts, whose former team mate Kellen Winslow happens to have his son on the field for Miami. Listen and make it a drinking game for all the times his views lean to the Miami side. Even stating ardently that the pass interference call at the end was horrible, when you can buy a poster of it online showing Chris Gamble being held while the ABC camera guy in full view is still showing Krenzel in  post passing mode , while the ball is on its way to a tangled up Gamble.

This game has it all, including a swarming Buckeye defense and a very fast Hurricane defense as well. You can also try to find all the players who later were drafted into the NFL, maybe the most ever for a national title game. Ohio State alone had 15 players drafted in one season following the game- an NFL record. Watch Willis Mcgahee's leg flop around like a slinky after Will Allen ends his college career late in the 3rd period, a not for the faint of heart Theisman-like injury!

Another fine viewing tip, don't adjust your tv screen. The stadium is 95% Ohio State fans for a national championship game. Both teams are basically the same distance away from the game site- Arizona. It looked like a home game in the Shoe! And people that were at the game have said that thousands more were outside the stadium.",1139184000,8,2008,4.475409836065574

1904429,5,B0000AC8LM,"I'm not kidding, this is the greatest football game ever played.  The pre-game hype had Miami favored by as much as 21 points.  From the first series for both teams you can see the fire in there eyes.  This is four quarters of pure football like you've never seen before, plus two bonus overtimes.  Watch as ""The Ohio State Buckeyes"" are held on almost every series, keeping Miami in the game.  Watch as they overcome cheating, the referees, even the announcers, and ""Shock the world"".  This game comes down to one thing and one thing only...  Both teams get the ball on the two yard line, but only one team takes the pig skin to the promise land.  Did you know that they were serving buckeye soup on the planes full of Miami fans.  Do you know what a buckeye is?",1122940800,10,763,4.3546099290780145

7996465,5,B0000AC8LM,"As I was saying, one of the best games ever! As far as bowl games go, in my opinion I would rate Texas/USC 1, Clemson/Alabama 2, (2nd game), and this one tied with Boise St./OU, 3rd!! I have been watching college football for over 30 years. I'm 41 and a life long Texas Longhorns fan. There was a period in the 90's where I kind of put football on the back burner and didn't watch as many games as I usually did. I was working at a bar the night of the Bcs championship game hosting Ohio St. and Miami. I'm not really a fan of either team but like many, I was routing for the underdog. This game had it all ! The drama, the hard hits, the bad calls, and unfortunately that ugly knee injury suffered by Mcgahee! Poor guy. Reminded me a little of when L.T. snapped Theisman's leg like a twig! Hard to watch and worse when they kept replaying it! Plus, the game went to double overtime!! And Ohio St., was not at all intimidated by big bad Miami, which had probably the best team in the history of college football the year before and an undefeated 35 game streak going!!! I had customers yelling at me to bring their drinks and I was not satisfying their demands cause the game was just so great!! ""Be right there, gimme a second."" That was me for 3 plus hours! Hurt my tip jar but I was gonna make it up after the game and on the following night at the other bar I worked at! This game got me back into being a rabid fan of the game I loved so much!

7996468,5,B0000AC8LM,"One of THE greatest football games I have ever seen.  Ohio State was written off before the game even started as an unworthy opponent.  Miami had future NFL players at every position and they were oozing swagger, and rightfully so.  They were defending champs and undefeated.  Many pundits were considering them the greatest team of all time.  It wasn't a matter of if they would beat Ohio State, but how badly they would beat them.  However, Ohio State was also undefeated, with many future NFL players as well.  Not to mention a true freshmen running back in Maurice Clarett.  This game wasn't expected to be the epic battle that it was, but the double overtime thriller proved to be an instant classic.  Willis McGahee's horrific injury, Clarett's strip of Sean Taylor's INT, and the controversial pass interference call all made this a game to remember.  Being an Ohio State fan, I know I will never forget watching this game in my friend's basement.  The jubilation of your team winning a championship for the first time can never be overshadowed.  A truly remarkable experience, I can now relive again and again on this DVD.",1482796800,,1130,4.7979274611398965
