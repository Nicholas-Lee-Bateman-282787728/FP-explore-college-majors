The footage shows how effortlessly the elderly Ueshiba could throw or pin someone larger and younger than himself.  Although the product description purports that the footage is from the 1930's, the footage is probably from a later decade, as evidenced by the fact that Ueshiba is shown with the majestic white beard that he had in his advanced years.  Ueshiba's real-life abilities are more impressive to watch than the special effects stunts that are common in martial arts movies today.",1117411200,8,605,5.090909090909091
