8220288,5,B000VWQUEW,"this interview compilation was fantastic... I wish they would do this with all of the stages of her career. If you enjoyed Truth or Dare and I'm Going To Tell You A Secret, you really should add this to your collection (and it's cheap too!)",1362268800,2,240,4.355555555555555
8220289,5,B000VWQUEW,"This dvd is a must have for all Madonna fans! This is not authorized by Madonna or her record company, but this is a great fan made collection of rare interviews from the 80s. There are a couple interviews from the 90s and one interview from the Confessions era.",1341446400,3,262,4.36734693877551
8220290,5,B000VWQUEW,"This DVD is perfect for anyone who wants to learn more about Madonna, there is tons of unauthorized DVD's of Madonna on here, but this one is cool. It contains alot of compiled interviews of her ranging from when she released Like A Virgin to a closing interview with David Letterman around the release of Confessions on the Dance Floor. This DVD really explores the different re-inventions of her and her persona. I find this video very insightful to Madonna's lengthy and successful career. You can learn about her personal life since from the very beginning and more. I recommend only renting only because its not something you would really wanna watch more than once.

8220291,5,B000VWQUEW,"...this one is excellent. nobody is on here except for madonna and her interviewers. this is a chronological archive of her tv interviews...from bandstand to random early mtv ones to jane pauley.....this is a dvd compiling all those great interviews we madonna fans watched growing up and tape recorded on our vcrs-but all together on dvd! i am always hesistant for unofficial, unauthorized things because I value authenticity but I rented the dvd first. the program is just flowing interview to interview, straight up. no creepy interviews with the baby mama cousins of aquaintances, etc.",1201219200,27,589,5.2105263157894735
