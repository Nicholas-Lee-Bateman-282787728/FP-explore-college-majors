8155580,2,B000KC8MTY,"Although it's wonderful to see and listen to Sam Snead talk about his life, I was hoping for more archival swing footage along the lines of the Hogan Collection. This DVD does not provide that and might be a little misleading in its description.",1245715200,2,245,4.590909090909091
8155581,5,B000KC8MTY,"If you are a passionate golfer (I'm not sure there is any other kind), you'll certainly enjoy this DVD. I won't say it'll improve your game (it might) but just to listen to the great Sam Snead talking about every aspect of the game and his glorious career is well worth the price. This is golf history trough the eyes of one of it's most important figures.",1191974400,3,356,4.3283582089552235
