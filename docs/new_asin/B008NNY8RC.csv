5170756,4,B008NNY8RC,"BAIT: a scruffy-lookin' stephen moyers with crazy eyes going into some woody area called ""the barrens"". and itsa film by darren lynn bousman. OK, i'm sold.

REEL: first five minutes is your typical lost-in-the-woods couple getting the smackdown from The Monster. but then from the opening credits that start rolling immediately after to the blackout at the very end, The Barrens beats the typical horror movie structure to a pulp. most horror flicks about folklore send the hero on a research project to discover the origins of the monster for a clue on how to destroy the menace. well, stephen moyers doesn't need to discover any origins about the jersey devil cuz he enters into the plot already knowing how the beastie came to be. The Barrens isn't just trying to scare you with scenes of monster carnage -- it's really a carefully paced magic trick designed to distract the audience from the characters' Ultimate Doom. if you don't pay attention to details, the final minutes'll pull a fast one on ya. i wasn't paying much attention to details because the ride to the surprise ending was fast and furious. the entire cast is amazing, though i gotta give extra kudos to moyers' performance as the paranoid dad. his increasing crazy keeps you guessing: is it his imagination getting out of hand or is it really the jersey devil?

CATCH: The Barrens does a great job of piling up the bodies and tension in a creative way. and really, even though this film's got lots going for it (visuals, cast, plot, well played family drama), what i liked best is darren's ability to keep on piling on, all the way to the bloody end. cuz, after all, piles of bodies, and the promise of more to come, is what makes a horror film so bloody horrifying. it's all about the lasting impressions eh, long after you've left the dark theater.",1350172800,,1820,4.684375
5170757,1,B008NNY8RC,"i wonder why people produce films whose screenplays are actually NOT SCARY?

5170758,2,B008NNY8RC,"""The deer, his antlers, it wasn't the fence that tore them off...it was the Leed's Devil...Jersey Devil."" Richard (Moyer) is a father who can feel his family slipping away. They don't do anything together anymore so he decides to pack them all up and drive them out to the woods where he went as a kid for a weekend camping trip. When they get there the hear of a missing person. Richard begins to wonder if the stories he heard about the Jersey Devil are true. This is a movie for true horror fans only. The movie is pretty slow and not very original but on the other hand it is a very neat idea. The biggest problem with this is that once again the idea of the movie is better then the movie itself. The idea of the Jersey Devil is something that is made for a horror movie, but to me this one was just to slow and not really scary enough to fully expand on the ""legend"" of the devil. This movie really just boiled down to a family going crazy in the woods, which has been done over and over. Fans of the ""Hunters"" or even ""Wrong Turn"" may like this but to me it was just too slow and un-original to fully enjoy. Overall, another movie that had a really good idea but ended up being a cookie cutter horror movie. I give it a C+.",1349827200,7,1230,4.1078838174273855
5170759,2,B008NNY8RC,"I hate when I put a movie in I was excited to see and it fails to meet my expectations. That's exactly how I felt when the credits rolled on Darren Lynn Bousman's ""The Barrens."" This is the perfect example of a film whose beginning and end shine but the middle just drags on for too long. After seeing what Bousman did with ""Mother's Day,"" I really expected more from his next outing.

Richard Vineyard (Stephen Moyer) needs a little time off from his busy life and the trappings of modern civilization. He takes his family on a camping trip to the pine forests of New Jersey called the Barrens. His father used to take him there as a boy. Richard wants to honor his father's wishes by scattering his ashes throughout the area. Upon arriving at their campsite, they are bombarded with stories about a creature spawned from Satan named the Jersey Devil. Richard becomes convinced the monster is hunting his family and the other campers down as gutted bodies start turning up.

I have no complaints when it comes to the picture quality of the film. ""The Barrens"" looks great and the cinematography successfully captures the gloomy and massive expanse of the forest. The creature itself is shot close-up to give us a glimpse of what it looks like but never delivers full body shots until the climax of the film. Obviously a mix of practical and CGI effects were used to capture the actions of the Jersey Devil and it looks realistic no matter what angle it's shot in.

The movie's 5.1 surround sound mix guarantees viewers that all the sudden jerks of the musical score, loud screams, trees rustling, and gunshots are projected all over your home theater. You feel like you're actually in the forest with the Vineyard family. This helps pull the audience into the film and make them feel like they're living it.

The only bonus material we get for ""The Barrens"" Blu-ray is audio commentary by Writer / Director Darren Lynn Bousman and Director of Photography Joseph White. A deleted scene offers an alternate ending for the movie. Commentary is provided by Bousman in regards to the deleted scene as well. It would have been nice to get a ""Making of"" featurette which expanded on the special effects used to bring the creature to life.

I wish I could say something more positive about ""The Barrens."" The performances by the actors in the film are excellent and the filming techniques are striking. However, a redundant mid-section foils any chance the movie has of rising above mediocrity.",1349740800,20,2487,4.721198156682028

5170785,1,B008NNY8RC,The Jersey Devil is my favorite cryptid so I am tremendously disappointed with this movie and it's utterly craptastic depiction of the Jersey Devil as a flying meathead bull-dinosaur-shark- whatever the hell it was. The movie wasn't even shot in the Pine Barrens and I know that because I looked it up after wondering why the forest didn't have pine trees and wasn't barren. This movie sucked front to back and I'm writing this to warn other fans of the legend of the Jersey Devil to stay away from this movie and go make your own Jersey Devil movie instead because these filmmakers did not do their homework.,1448841600,,609,4.648148148148148

5170788,5,B008NNY8RC,"The film deals with some very troublesome issues that many families face these days- disconnection from one another. In the world of high speed lifestyles and digital personalities there is nothing more alien than those we share blood and shelter with. Sometimes we are aliens even to ourselves in this new global stressed world. So why not get back to nature, back to basics, and back to the birthplace of evil and legend?! A very dark emotional set up that just spirals deeper into the void of despair.

The Barrens is a double fake out film. It is common in a lot of horror films where the audience is set up to believe then question one outcome of the plot only to have those very answers we seek to be simple distraction as we are lead back into a different synopsis. Sometimes it works in cinema and sometimes it just pisses the movie goer off, never to see another film that vaguely resembles the premise. This time it works.

The ending is pretty killer in the fact that the whole time you are pointing blame in one direction for the nightmare unfolding, you soon become aware of the truth of the story. The film is really genius in the subtle way it plays with this ever guessing style of story telling because it doesnt force you to think one way or the other. The movie just carries you along for the ride into a chilling thriller. There are no really big scares or shock moments in this film, but then again the movie didn't need them.",1433462400,,1447,4.43609022556391

5170801,3,B008NNY8RC,"Was a bit disappointed with this film. The acting is OK, except for the sheriff with the Canadian accent, who's supposed to be a New Jersey cop. No offense to Canadians, but the casting director couldn't find a guy from NJ (with that distinct accent) to play this role? Then I find out the movie was actually filmed in Canada (that explains the accent). Again, nothing wrong with Canada, but southern Ontario looks nothing like the Pine Barrens region of southern NJ (been to both areas, not many similarities). The movie itself is just OK. Not a lot of suspense, creature effects are just OK. Too much drama between the family members on this camping trip. Why not just have them head deep into the Barrens, and slowly get hunted by the Jersey Devil? A great idea, just muddled.",1427155200,,779,4.611510791366906

5170820,5,B008NNY8RC,"When a family of four, beset of late by the kind of normal familial angst that crops up every once in a while, heads out for a weekend of family bonding in the New Jersey Barrens, things are about to get a whole lot worse, not better.  The Barrens, reputedly the home of the Jersey Devil, a legendary bat-winged creature, is full of campers and not conducive to the kind of away time the father of the family (Stephen Moyer) wants, so he leads them deeper into the woods, off the regular trail of tourists.  Here things get dark.

Strange things start happening and the family feels like they're being stalked.  But is it the Jersey Devil, or are some of the fellow campers more dangerous than they seem, or is the threat closer still?  As the movie unfolds, you realize that certain events are not necessarily 'real', but may be in one of the character's heads.  I find that, usually when a movie does this kind of thing, it doesn't work well.  If a character is unsure, for example, whether the house is really haunted or not, that's fine.  But when we, the viewers, are left unsure whether certain events are even happening or exist largely or only in the imagination of a character, whether they're really seeing things or if the things they see are hallucinations, it usually doesn't work.  The Barrens is one of the exceptions where it does work well.  It actually heightens the suspense and tension as characters are unsure whether they can believe what they're seeing, and as they don't know who to trust while the sanity of certain characters is in question.  To give you an idea of what I mean, and whether you're going to like this, I feel that movies that end with 'it was just a dream' or something like that usually don't work that well.  On the other hand, in the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phantasm/dp/B000MV8ABS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phantasm</a>&nbsp;it was unclear what was real and what wasn't, and that was an excellent movie; and in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Usual-Suspects-Special-Edition/dp/B00005V9HH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Usual Suspects (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;it was unclear what events being related in the accounts of various characters was real and what they were making up, and that worked well too.  Those are two very different movies from each other and from The Barrens, but they (I feel) give good examples that a story loaded with the ""what's real and what isn't?"" aspect can work out very well some of the time.

The Barrens DOES eventually answer most of its own questions, but it's only after going through a twisting, turning, ultra-intense road of uncertainties.  The acting throughout is excellent, with Peter DaCunha in the role of the little boy being especially memorable.  The atmosphere is loaded with menace, psychological tension, and the ever-lurking question of whether the monstrous is real, internal, or somewhere in-between.  Dark, original, and edge-of-your-seat suspenseful, this is a must for horror movie fans.",1393113600,,3096,5.272912423625255

5170828,3,B008NNY8RC,"I was not expecting to enjoy this as much as I did.

You can ask anybody in New Jersey, and they will probably tell you. The legend of the Jersey Devil, a nightmarish creature that is rumored to live within the dense Pine Barrens of Southern New Jersey, has been around for over 400 years. The story of it has, within that time, attained the same level of mysticism that currently surrounds the oft-mentioned folklores of Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster.

The most accepted origin of the tale, at least as far the residents of New Jersey are concerned, began with Mother Leeds and reads as follows:

""It was said that Mother Leeds had 13 children and, after giving birth to her 12th child, stated that if she had another, it would be the Devil. In 1735, Mother Leeds was in labor on a stormy night. Gathered around her were her friends. Mother Leeds was supposedly a witch and the child's father was the Devil himself. The child was born normal, but then changed form. It changed from a normal baby to a creature with hooves, a horse's head, bat wings and a forked tail. It growled and screamed, then killed the midwife before flying up the chimney. It circled the villages and headed toward the pines. In 1740 a clergy exorcised the demon for 100 years and it wasn't seen again until 1890.""

That, in a nutshell, is the basic setup for ""The Barrens,"" the latest feature film by Director Darren Lynn Bousman. Mr. Bousman, who some horror fans might remember from his contributions to the ""Saw"" franchise, trades graphic gore and massive body counts for a far more subtle and effectively eerie psychological character study. The screenplay focuses upon a man-(Stephen Moyer from HBO's popular ""True Blood"" vampire series)-who, within the downward spiral of a full-fledged mental collapse, becomes convinced that he and his family are being stalked while camping in the Pine Barrens by the legendary Jersey Devil.

Moyer, who is using his native British accent here, channels Jack Nicholson from ""The Shining"" as, little by little, his grasp on reality and his very sanity slowly begins to flake away. Bousman does a uniform job at breaking down the reason for Moyer's decline, so much to the point where you're actually wondering whether anything he's witnessing is the real deal or all in his head. And that, believe it or not, is what really helps sell this movie. It keeps you riveted straight through to the very end.

And, what an ending! The payoff it rewards you with is so worth it in ways I dare not spoil. It was enough of a pleasant surprise to motivate me towards adding ""The Barrens"" to my ever-blossoming Blu-Ray collection.

As video releases go, the Blu-Ray isn't all bad. The picture quality ranks right up there with the very best. There are no special features to speak of, unfortunately, not even a behind-the-scenes featurette; something I had actually wanted to see. But you do get a deleted scene, an alternate add-on to the existing ending that I personally feel should have been restored, and a running commentary by Bousman, himself.

A rather cool and catchy opening tune by Kevin Welch, too, I must say.

I am and always have been a rabid fan of any and all things horror, and I was very pleased with the way this film played out. To anyone who may, for whatever reason, be on the fence about watching it, I say: go for it! It's a welcome change of pace, especially if you're in the mood for something different.",1361577600,2,3441,4.6650165016501655

It has the guy from TrueBlood and the girl from ""The L Word"" starring in the movie.  I was not bored once, it keeps on at a spooky, jumpy pace.

Could the legend of the Jersey Devil really be true, or is some other force responsible for the mysterious deaths in THE BARRENS? Darren Lynn Bousman presents his take on the Jersey Devil myth in this bloody new thriller, which is no less forgettable than the other attempts that have already been made on the story. The main issue lies in the over-dramatized lead performance by Stephen Moyer, who becomes increasingly unbearable as father figure Richard Vineyard. None of the snotty teenagers in the supporting cast help to make things any better. Bousman also adds several irrelevant twists that only serve to confuse and complicate an otherwise simple plot. When the creature is finally revealed, it looks like a mangled mess of animal parts and shabby animatronics. Even the flashy editing gives a sense of cheapness to the look of the film, which is quite unusual for the otherwise talented director. Unless you prefer for your creature features to be filled with annoying characters instead of either frights or action, we suggest you avoid THE BARRENS.

5170843,1,B008NNY8RC,"Having lived in southern NJ near the Pine Barrens for many years I can tell you that this movie was very likely not even filmed in the Pine Barrens. If it was it was in section that I have never seen (It was filmed in Toronto!). Since when does the NJ Pine Barrrens have bears and cougars? Where are the dwarf pine trees? Since when does it have mountains? The most dangerous things there are the other campers and tourists. The story makes absolutely no sense at all. The Jersey Devil itself doesn't really appear until the very end of the film and it looks totally fake. It looks like a college kid in a Halloween mask and a fur coat, which it probably is. God forbid that the director waste good money on descent special effects for a grade Z movie. It's never explained why it waits until the very end of the movie to attack the hero and his family since it attacks everyone around them or what the connection is between the father and the Jersey Devil.
Why would he want to return to the very forest with his family where he believes there is a dangerous beast that will kill them all?. If a lot of people suddenly turned up dead in the Pine Barrens wouldn't there be cops everywhere? Of course nobody thinks to call them even when they find dead animals and human bodies. They spend most of the movie suggesting that the husband, who apparently never bathes, shaves or changes his clothes, is going crazy from a rabies infection (He seems pretty wacked out anyway.) and then the movie cops out at the last minute by saying that the Jersey Devil really does exist. The director even stoops to showing Mia Kirshner with less and less clothes on and even a wet t-shirt so all the guys in the audience can get a cheap thrill. This must be the dumbest family in existence. Also, the characters are all cliches, although the mother seems to have some brains, which leads to the question of why she would want to be married to a complete wack job of a husband. Thank God I didn't buy this movie. Stephen Moyer and all the other actors in this movie should be ashamed and the people of southern NJ should be outraged. Someday someone who is a much better director and more knowledgeable may make a good movie about the Jersey Devil(the director from the Saw movie sequels, really?), but this isn't it. If you really must see this movie take it out from your local, public library if they have it or wait until it''s on cable, which shouldn't take long.",1359244800,2,2450,4.398678414096916

Only the timid little boy in the family struck me as sympathtic.

So immediately I don't feel overly concerned about the fate of the leads.  Add to that a clumsy script, cheap looking effects and a plot you've seen many times before, and there's not much to recommend this one.

5170860,4,B008NNY8RC,"Darren Lynn Bousman's moody film is a taut psychological thriller set in the infamous Pine Barrens, home of the legendary Jersey Devil.
Stephen Moyer (True Blood) trades his fangs for a backpack as the father who takes his family to the Barrens to disperse his father's ashes at their favorite fishing hole.
It's not long before Moyer's disposition radically changes and mysterious deaths occur in the Barrens.
The question arises - is dad going bonkers or does the Jersey Devil really exist?  Bousman cautiously leads his audience down a cryptic path and to his credit, provides a surprising resolution.
Moyer gets to use his native English accent and does quite well in his demanding role.  Mia Kirshner is effective as his devoted wife who watches her hubby crumble before her eyes.  The actors playing the youngsters are above average as well.
THE BARRENS is an unusual and original hybrid, acting as a psychological character study and a creepy horror tale.  Its worth a rental at least.",1352851200,,992,4.957831325301205
5170861,3,B008NNY8RC,"As I started to write this week's column I was going to write about ROCK OF AGES. Then I thought why waste the space on something I didn't like much (although it did make me want to go seek out the music in my collection) when I could write about a small movie that was better? And more qualified for the Halloween season as well.

THE BARRENS, as some of you already know, is a wooded area in New Jersey set aside for camping and such. It's also well known for the existence of a creature known as the Jersey Devil. This winged man like creature has supposedly stalked the woods for decades and paranormal investigators have sought it out for years. So it only makes sense that a horror film concern itself with the area.

Richard Vineyard (Stephen Moyer) is a father and new husband trying to unite his family. His daughter Sadie is at that age where everything is about rebellion. Tie that in with her rejection of her stepmother Cynthia (Mia Kirshner) feeling she's trying to replace her deceased mother and the son Richard and Cynthia had together, Danny, she's the typical annoying character that you hope learns about reality before the film ends. To bring this family together, Richard has decided that they are going camping in the Barrens, the place where his father took him when he was young.

As they prepare for the trip Richard seems distracted, at times even fearful of the trip even though he initiated it. Memories of his childhood in the woods seem to have a haunted moment that he can't quite remember. But the family heads out to the woods for a camping weekend. Along the way, upset that the family can't leave their gadgets behind for just a few days, he tells his wife to put away the cell phone and his daughter to take off the Ipod. This weekend is about nature.

The family arrives and sets up camp but its nothing like Richard remembers. Instead of the isolated campground that he recalled there are tons of families here for the weekend. When he finds his daughter flirting with a young man in the campground area, he insists that they move deeper into the woods to be more secluded.

As the trip proceeds Richard gets more distracted, breaking out in a sweat and behaving unusual. It isn't until later that the cause is revealed, at least part of it. Is there something physically wrong with Richard? Something mentally disturbing? Or is he truly the victim of the Jersey Devil whose story is told around the campfire one night?

It's these questions and watching to find clues for the answer that make this film work so well. You never know if there is something creeping in the woods or if Richard has lost it. As bodies begin to turn up gutted, torn to shreds, you remember Richard playing with his knife and start to consider he's gone mad. Then again perhaps it was this creature that shredded its victims. The final solution to the mystery should satisfy everyone.

The movie builds up at a slow pace, increasing the tension as you watch. You not only fear what will happen to those around this family but what will happen to the family itself. Each actor does a wonderful job in the roles given but Moyers stands out as the head of the house that seems to be just tipping over the edge with each scene. Every supporting actor does a great job as well convincingly playing victims of one kind or another.

One negative note that can be corrected. Included in the film is an alternate ending. While watching that I felt that it should have been tacked on as well. It would have made the ending of the film better even though it's still got enough surprises to hold your interest until the end.",1352764800,,3628,4.5198170731707314

Or is there really a ""Jersey Devil,"" a hyper-natural predator savagely hunting among the trees?

I've seen him in TRUEBLOOD, RESTRAINT and THE CALLER and thought he did an excellent job of acting in each but the job he did in THE BARRENS shows just how versatile an actor he is. It was more suspense than horror and just enough blood and gore to be a horror movie. I have never seen any of DARREN LYNN BOUSMAN's other movies but if they are half as good a ride as this one, I may have to watch them. The scenes are cut so as not to give too much away but they do give a feeling of something ominous. This is worth getting.",1352332800,,718,3.858108108108108

Richard (Stephen Moyer) decides to drag his family camping in the Pinelands where his dad would take him camping as a child. Richard plans to scatter his dad's ashes on the trip. His family is not eager about the whole thing.

As the film progresses, we discover, as does his family, that Richard has serious issues. Unfortunately by the time the family realizes what is happening, they are located deep in ""Devil"" territory.

I liked the scare factor in this film. The story flashback at the campfire was well done. Stephen Moyer played a convincing role as a man becoming....you'll find out. Allie MacDonald plays the moody 17 year old daughter. 5 stars might seem overrated for a film that has a high amount of predictability. In spite of that, the acting, direction, and script were done well, something I would like to see more of in ""B"" horror films.

If you're looking for a standard lost in the woods, scary-gory urban legend horror film, this is a pretty decent one. If you're looking for anything beyond that, you will probably find THE BARRENS quite a waste of time.

Pros:

--Acting, script, and cinematography are better than many films in this genre;

--Makes good use of anti-climaxes and dream sequences as well as effective vagary regarding how human/inhuman the monster really is.

Cons:

--A lot of loose plot threads, as well as some irrelevant and derivative details;

--Although it could be gorier--and I realize that some people like gore for its own sake--all the entrails assault the senses, and while they're really grotty, both animal and human, they all look alike;

--It would be more frightening to just give quick, patchy glimpses of the monster (or not show it at all) than to give such clear shots of the crazy thing.",1351900800,,905,4.869281045751634

5170869,4,B008NNY8RC,"Reviews on this site for this film have been mixed, but personally I enjoyed it. There is nothing groundbreaking about a movie about a family being stuck in the woods, but the tension and conflicts between the characters are well executed, the movie has a brisk pace to it, and generally the story is pretty solid.

The performances by te cast are hit-or-miss, with the dependable Mia Kirshner being one of the bright spots. The film nearly gets sidetracked in the middle by focusing too heavily on the family dynamic, and yes, of course the family members occasionally do irrational things, but that's just the case with these types of movies. I mean, let's face it, if you've purchased or rented a movie about the Jersey Devil, you should be prepared to suspend disbelief a little.

If you're looking for an entertaining film that won't make you think too much, especially if it's just a cheap rental, then this makes for a decent return on your investment. It won't make you yell at the screen too much, but the suspense will keep you focused on the screen until the end, and that's what a thriller like this one is designed to do. ""The Barrens"" accomplishes that. 3.5 stars.",1351036800,10,1178,4.658653846153846

An abundance of critical overacting along with a ""monster"" made up of a horses head with glued on wings of some sort for ""special effects"" made me cringe to the very bitter end (not soon enough). The lead dude suffering from ""rabies"" should be ashamed of himself to be associated to such a bad grade c movie. The women on this film never quit screaming & overacting in a vain effort to attempt to make this terrible movie worth while watching. At the end when you see the entire family writhing around in spit, blood and various parts of greenery was nausheating to say the very least. Poor story line along with very bad overacting really sent this groaner to where it should never be brought out from again..

5170881,5,B008NNY8RC,"Where to start? The story is interesting--The Barrens isn't just a story about a monster stalking a family. If you're looking for a straight monster movie, be warned--that seems to be one of the biggest complaints other reviewers have had. In fact, to me, this film isn't nearly as much about the monster as it is about the father slowly going crazy and the family that is disconnected from each other. I found the legend and the monster interesting and well done, but the story of the family was far more intriguing. Together, those two elements made for a great story.

The cast is excellent and give a superb performance. Stephen Moyer as Richard Vineyard is very believable. Mia Kirshner as Cynthia Vineyard is excellent. Allie MacDonald and Peter DaCunha as the Vineyard siblings are great. The scenes of the forest are perfect at helping create an unsettling feeling. The monster is also very well done and not overused. Anyone who is a fan of Darren Lynn Bousman, interesting, well-done monsters and psychological thrillers, will love The Barrens.

That's the story that Darren begins to unfold before us. We are introduced to a broken family that we know nothing about. All we know is that the family dog is missing. And this adorable little boy will stop at nothing to find him. It seems as if there are already secrets kept from us from the start.

Daddy is never a friendly face. From the first look at him. You see discomfort, sadness, and settling. But why??? We just don't know. Darren then introduces, Step-mom trying to get step-daughter ready for their Daddy's trip. It doesn't go well. Either way. Daddy gets the whole family together for an annual trip to the Pine Barrens.

Home to the Jersey Devil. I enjoy the whole Folklore aspect of this movie. Because those stories are hard to tell. Without breaking the make believe code. And what Darren story tells us is that, we can sense evil anywhere. We can always say. The evil is out there....

""Its the Hardest to say... The Evil is right here in our hearts...""

As we enter the Pine Barrens, We learn something. The dears are easy prey for something. Something real is doing this! But What?? Blood, guts, and gore effect are terrific.

My favorite part in this movie is the Tale of the Leads Devil.

Its so gripping. Like as a child, being told about the Loch Ness monster for the first time. You don't know what to expect. Is it real? Or just a story? Old history tells dark twisted tales of Old Monsters that still live today. Same setting once again for our family. But, has daddy seen or know something from his past???? More questions.

That's why i loved this movie. You have to use the little hints...

American Folklore is a subject that NEEDS to be reviewed and studied. For the sake of great movies. Please, if your going to remake,reboot, or just do the same thing over and over. Be original. Great Job Darren. I hope everyone goes to see The Barrens. I loved how it was filmed during the day. Never Trust the Trees....Your True Fan Tom Dragna II",1350172800,2,2198,4.461346633416459

Not since The Shining has there been such a convincing potrayal of a man's descent into madness, & for his performance, Stephen Moyer (True Blood) deserves high praise. The pacing of the film is perfect, & the suspense level is sustained until the very last scene. If gore is your thing, there is plenty of that too.

5170887,4,B008NNY8RC,"Darren Lynn Bousman has proved to be a quite prolific director, so much so that I was unaware that he was even making The Barrens, let alone it getting a Blu-ray release. He first came to our attention with a triple-whammy of Saw films, all of which I thoroughly enjoy, and then came the rather wonderful Repo: The Genetic Opera. After this it goes a bit ass about tit, with 11-11-11 coming out on DVD around about the same time as his Mother's Day reboot hit shiny. 11-11-11 being a misfire for the most part, although not terrible, and the long delayed Mother's Day being a wonderfully brutal home invasion flick. Now, we have The Barrens dropping on Blu-ray/DVD combo pack, as I wait quietly for The Devil's Carnival to get a wide release. For those that have lost count, that's 9 films in 7 years. Told you he was prolific.
So, after all that rambling, I shall now focus on the case at hand; that being The Barrens. Set in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey, but actually filmed in Canada, The Barrens follows the Vineyard family as they head out into the titular Barrens, so that Michael (the father and husband) can scatter the ashes of his deceased father in the area that they used to camp in.
Along the way we get to learn a little about the myth of the Jersey Devil, including a short, sharp and sweet prologue piece, and the usual trials and tribulations of a slightly dysfunctional family. The campsite that they head to is nothing like Michael remembers it to be, instead it is overrun and one of the kids succeeds in scaring the bejeezus out of Michael's son, Danny, with his tale of the Jersey Devil.
As the film progresses we, as the viewer, are asked whether this is a film about a man, Michael, hunted by the Jersey Devil, or a man that is on the brink of a mental breakdown as he suffers from an initially unknown ailment. All will be revealed of course, and the film doesn't always go where you think it will.
I can honestly say that I had no idea what to expect from this film. I thought Mother's Day was excellent, but 11-11-11 had me worried, so where would it fall in Bousman's quality of output? Well, I can safely say that it falls into his better movies. It isn't without fault; you will find yourself questioning many of the characters actions, of that I can assure you, but Stephen Moyer, as Michael, puts in a disturbing performance and helps carry the film along in its many directions.
That is also one of the film's flaws; Bousmann has tried to cram a lot of ideas into what should have been a fairly simple plotline. Bear with him though, as this tale is a good one, and as you might expect from Bousman he isn't afraid to throw the claret and guts about, without losing a sense of dread and atmosphere.
The Barrens is a good looking movie, with the woods of Ontario, Canada, being utilized nicely, along with sharp looking cinematography and decent sound effects. I could have done without some hokey music playing from a radio in one abandoned campsite, and Michael gets hit on the head one too many times, but the direction the plot takes is a quite refreshing one.
This release does come complete with an audio commentary from Bousman and his director of photography, Joseph White, but aside from that and one deleted scene, there is nowt else in the extras. I can live with that though as The Barrens is an above average chiller that kept my attention, even when it wasn't firing on all cylinders.
The Barrens is well worth checking out, especially if you are a fan of Bousman's movies, or are just looking for a creepy and entertaining yarn. At the end of the day, The Barrens is a solid and surprising movie.",1350172800,16,3645,4.458083832335329

That was gradually explained, but there were an awful lot of times where one didn't know what was real and what wasn't, it became so very annoying. Some of the things that the family did, were very questionable, like, why in the world would anybody choose to stay at a campsite deep in the woods, alone, which was so obviously the site of something really horrible happening? Mom needed to use some judgment of her own, to take some initiative and to not allow her family to be put into such bad circumstances, especially when it was so obvious that Dad had a screw loose.
