The entire concept of creating a food opera of sorts replete with splendid Fantasia-like graphics, singers, fantastic food concepts, and music, all different course-by-course into a single film is amazing.  Even the plates were individual hand crafted by well-known sculptural artists.

This is an absolute must-see of any serious foodie or lover of music, visual arts and junkies for one-of-a-kind films.  I was crest-fallen to learn from the festival organizer that this film was not picked up for distribution, I absolutely can't understand why.  I'm now going to buy two copies to send to my friends on the East Coast.  Enjoy",1445817600,,801,5.0227272727272725
