1992961,5,B0001DYG38,"Considering I was a child in the 60's, you could understand why I became a Dick Van Dyke fan primarily to Mary Poppins as opposed to his TV show (it was the 70's when I first saw the TV show in reruns).  This movie sealed me being a fan.

An actor is picked up by a gang, thinking he is a vicious hit man.  (If you can picture Van Dyke as a hit-man, you can see how funny this movie is.)  Edward G. Robinson is excellent as a gangster who still comes across as a father figure to a point.

This movie is rated G.  I wish Hollywood would re-investigate this film, and see a movie about gangsters can be funny without sex and violence.

By the way, this movie, one of my all-time favorite comedies, was also my introduction to pop art.",1164844800,7,733,4.083916083916084
1992962,4,B0001DYG38,"Dick Van Dyke stars as struggling TV actor Jack, playing gangsters in hokey weekly series. In a case of mistake identity, a gang member picks up Jack on a street corner thinking he is the out of town hitman he is supposed to pick up for a big job. Taking him to the home of the mob boss, Jack tries to escape. When he realizes that discovery of his true identity means his death, Jack dives into the role of his life, literally. His mistaken identity cover-up is hilarious as he really seems to relish his role as a tough guy, even scaring the other real gangsters. Edward G. Robinson does a marvelous job playing a mob boss that would secretly prefer to be a painter and steals famous art for his own enjoyment instead of to sell. When the real hitman shows up, Jack has to convince the gang that HE is the phony, and stop the robbery. His love interest in the movie is well played by Dorothy Provine.

Disney Studios had high hopes for this film, starring one of their big name actors, and the film has its moments but was not a box office success. The scenes in the Art museum get a little tedious at the end but over all it is enjoyable, and there is some nice art as well.  A.J. Carothers wrote the screenplay, after working on several other Disney projects such as ""Miracle of the White stallions"". The story is based on the book by John Godey. The Disney movie posters promoting the film had a tagline that said, ""we're having such a wonderful crime..."". Released theatrically on June 26, 1968. It appeared on ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" in 1979.  It was released on video for the first time in 1985, and DVD for the first time in 2005.",1126051200,11,1647,4.340909090909091
1992963,4,B0001DYG38,"This is a nice little film that seems to be mostly forgotten by Disney fans or fans of Mr. Van Dyke. That's too bad, because the film is lots of fun, and gives Dick Van Dyke full range to showcase his physical comedy skills.

 If you thought all there was to Van Dyke's physical comedy was tripping over an ottoman, you'll be able to see his full range here.

 An actor mistaken for a crook, Van Dyke's character Jack Albany is taken to a gangster stronghold where a big art heist is being planned. Van Dyke is wonderful as the cowardly actor playing the part of a tough crook in order to stay alive.

 Besides the great comedy of Van Dyke, we also have the added treat of Edward G. Robinson sending up his famous gangster image. An avowed art lover in real life, Robinson goes after a famous painting in the film, and even tries his hand at abstract art.

 Also on hand are Slim Pickens, Henry Silva, and Jack Elam. Dorothy Provine (""That Darn Cat!"") plays art instructor and love interest Sally Inwood.

 On a side note, the director of the film, Jerry Paris, is probably best known as Rob and Laura Petrie's next door neighbor on ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"". Jerry cameos at the very end.

 This is great little film, but I have to knock off one star simply because Disney was too cheap to include a commentary track with surviving cast members.",1091059200,50,1345,4.379032258064516

1992966,5,B0001DYG38,"Well, in the hit and miss world of Disney live action DVD releases, it looks like we lucked out on this one.  The ever so king of physical comedy, Dick Van Dyke, is presented here in this delightful comedy in its original aspect ratio of 1.75:1.  As one viewer stated, buying Disney live action DVD's is like rolling dice.  Looks like we have a winner on this one.  Van Dyke scores a hit with his performance along with a delightful support cast of quality actors; Edward G. Robinson, Dorothy Provine, Jack Elam, Henry Silva and Slim Pickens along with several recognizable character actors.
This DVD one not to be missed.  But keep boycotting the ""Black Bearded"" releases and reward Disney when they bow to the wishes of the consumer.",1086393600,22,735,4.666666666666667

Van Dyke does get to display his physical acting talents but this film overall doesn't hold up particularly well in the 21st century.

1992976,3,B0001DYG38,"By shere serendipity I read Tim Lucas' Continental Op article immediately after watching this, which seems to be one of Disney's forays into the CO genre. Lucas apparently missed mentioning the latecomer to the movement Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971), but hey, it was a short article.

Definitely some Op moments, including a Looney Tune type gag with Dick slamming against a painting, but also features genuine trash-for-art, that should have never made it to the screen.

I also recently watched the superior Grand Slam (1967), a pretty cool caper film whose storyline not only mirrors this one's, but also stars the great Eddie G.

I found the movie and bought it for them to share with my brother's children, but we watched it with my parents first and still found it full of innocent fun.  You must pay attention to the small details, this was made back in the days where facial expressions and quick banter was truly the fun part of a movie, what I call an intelligent comedy.

1993000,2,B0001DYG38,"You are just asking for trouble when you slap a title on a movie that also makes a claim you can't provide, thus making it false advertising.

This overly stagey comedy is low on laughs (I chuckled twice) and slight on entertainment value.  The story is stretched to its limits by dragging out the first half keeping everyone locked in the mansion of mastermind gangster Leo Smooth (Edward G. Robinson).  The ""humor"" is strained around the single premise that Dick Van Dyke is mistaken for the mad killer Ace Williams.  He spends the bulk of the movie slipping in and out of this false persona, pulling faces the crooks never catch onto even though they're many and never varied.  Even when the real Ace (a sadly wasted Jack Elam) shows up, Van Dyke is still stuck in the same tired routine.  A little of this goes on far too long and ceases to be a source of amusement.  When they finally arrive at the art museum for the actual caper, the obligatory slapstick is too late in coming, too rote, and all too brief before the caper is abruptly wrapped up.  Leaving one to wonder why the likes of Slim Pickens bothered to show up for a part that didn't really allow him to do anything.  Even Dorothy Provine wearing go-go boots couldn't liven things up.",1375747200,4,1250,4.495575221238938

When Disney contacted him to do a few films, he did Robin Crusoe USN and Never a Dull Moment.  Of the two films, I enjoyed the second film the best.  It was a film I saw Dull Moment in the theater. I rolled with laughter  Not only for Mr. van Dyke's versatility but also the gamut of character actors that were in the film i.e. Jack Elam and Slim Pickerns.

Being from the 60s, it really fits in with his persona of the time, in my opinion. I could really see Rob Petrie trying to play a character like this, and doing a great job (unlike the time he got a small role, tried to kiss a girl who wasn't Laura, and failed miserably).

So with this movie, we had a lot of the physical comedy that made ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" so wonderful. He pretends to be drunk and you wonder if his body is actually made of rubber. He walks around on ledges without falling off. Well, almost. Gangsters chase him around. And he gets flustered a lot. All in all a pretty fun film.",1345766400,2,737,3.97972972972973

The absurd circumstances he's put in are tailor-made for Dick Van Dyke, just as you could say about certain movies, ""That was meant for Bob Hope"" or ""No one but Danny Kaye could do that part justice"".  As a matter of fact, a director of many Dick Van Dyke Show episodes, Jerry Paris, directed this delightful Disney comedy.  I consider this one of my top 5 favorite movies.",1340582400,2,605,4.375

Being that it was about 2 or 3 hours past my bedtime, I had to sneak to watch it...but it was definitely worth the trouble. It was this great, funny, quirky movie starring Dick Van Dyke that kept me entertained from beginning to end. In it Van Dyke plays Jack Albany, an actor who gets mistaken for mob-member Ace Williams. Jack goes along with the farce, thus hilarity ensues!
After that first night of watching it, I never had the luck of running into it again. Every so often throughout the years, I thought of it again and wished that I would come across it. Now, at age 27, imagine my surprise and excitement when I randomly stumbled upon it on Amazon! And I have to say, I love it as much now as I did then.
