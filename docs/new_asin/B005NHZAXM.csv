4847720,5,B005NHZAXM,"(THIS IS THE LONG AWAITED SEASON 4 OF THE DONNA REED SHOW. I spoke directly with MPI and they stated that what you are purchasing/pre-ordering in this listing, IS in fact all 39 episodes of Season 4 on 5 discs. The release of Season 5 will be sometime in 2012, as MPI has the rights to do this season also. As for the last 3 seasons-6,7 and 8- Donna Reed's family is working on getting the rights and having these made to dvd sets as well- but that is HOPEFULLY in the future.)

Donna Reed would have celebrated her 90th Birthday on January 27th of this year 2011, and instead of her getting gifts from her loving fans, WE FANS got the gift with the release of Season 4 of The Donna Reed Show! Wow! What a gift! Huge Thank You's go to The Estate of Donna Reed and Tony Owen, Donna's children- especially Mary Owen- who works relentlessly to get the rest of The Donna Reed Show seasons on dvd for us fans, and MPI! MPI has informed me that this is the BEST copy they could make of this Season 4- made from the original film and as sharp and gorgeously detailed as we have never seen! MPI is known for their great restorations of some of the best television shows, including another favorite of mine- Here's Lucy. Their dvd's are pristine! On top of all this, I'm hoping they include extra's- which they almost always do. What a great Holiday gift to all of us! This December we will be enjoying all 39 episodes of this Season 4, that we have all waited so long to see on dvd! THANK YOU TO ALL!

As usual, Donna was nominated for an Emmy- Outstanding Performance By A Lead Actress In A Series this Season 4. I always thought Donna Reed's performance was so natural in this series, because like Donna Stone, the real Donna Belle Reed was raised on a farm in Iowa. Her small town values made her the perfect Mom that all America loved to watch week after week. The children Mary (Shelley Fabares) and Jeff (Paul Petersen) are growing up fast. Jeff is 14 and Mary is 17. The highlight of this season is 17 year old Mary sings Johnny Angel in the episode DONNA'S PRIMA DONNA. Johnny Angel became a #1 hit for Shelley Fabares and sold over a million records that year. I am so looking forward to seeing this episode again! Of course, as always the guest stars are great. You'll see a very young Cloris Leachman and John Astin in the episode MOUSE AT PLAY and in ALOHA KIMI, Dr. Alex (Carl Betz) goes to beautiful Hawaii to treat a patient.

One thing I found very touching was on the internet this year- Shelley Fabares wrote a letter to Donna Reed's daughter Mary Owen. You rarely hear from Shelley Fabares in the press or public. Her letter (celebrating Donna's 90th birthday) was reminiscing about her working with Donna Reed and just how wonderful Donna was in private as she was on screen. If you haven't read it, it's easy to find- it's posted on many sites. I again cannot THANK MPI and Donna Reed's family enough for all their hard work in bringing us this fabulous Season 4- We are forever grateful to enjoy these 39 episodes again and cannot wait for Season 5 next year in 2012!

4847721,5,B005NHZAXM,The Donna Reed Show season 4. Is coming out this year. Thought to be release by mothers day. But is going to be release later.,1300924800,4,126,4.08
4847722,5,B005NHZAXM,"I contacted Paul Peterson about the next few seasons. They are doing everything that can be done to get them released.

Don't despair!",1285113600,11,134,4.826086956521739
4847723,5,B005NHZAXM,"Oh, I can't believe that it is hopeless to see the rest of the Donna Reed series!  To me it is a classic show that reflects the ideal of the times as The Cosby Show reflected the ideal of later times. But the amazing thing is that while watching it today, it is still incredibly funny without being offensive in  any way. I love the way Mary and Jeff fought and Donna's ability to manipulate situations showed the brilliance necessary for a  woman to run a home and manage family life well.",1278374400,6,490,4.304347826086956
4847724,5,B005NHZAXM,"Sadly, it looks as though ""The Donna Reed Show"" is DONE as far as anymore seasons being released to DVD! The other day I read Virgil Films announced it does NOT have the rights to anymore seasons of ""The Donna Reed Show"" beyond season 3--AND NEVER DID! When they took over from Arts & Alliance they made it sound they planned to release the whole show...now it looks like that was a lie! I loved this show on Nick-at-Nite growing up, and I truly hope some other studio company out there picks it up and releases more seasons--but it unfortunately it doesn't look good. :-(",1271376000,24,572,4.457142857142857
4847725,5,B005NHZAXM,"In 1958, I was 12 years old and didn't want to miss an episode. The Stones represented the kind of family life that I think people should strive for. I think we should realistically hope to achieve at least some of the understanding moments and the kind of family that has its ups and downs but truly cares for each other. It's true things went too far with Donna serving breakfast looking like a woman going out into the business world rather than a housewife. It's really something to think about when we realize that anyone of any age could enjoy a very entertaining show and have a laugh or two without worrying about whether his seven or eight year old should be watching. Recent shows like Rosanne and The Middle make me feel that the average child has nothing to strive for since the family has become a hopeless pit of deplorable behavior. Do we really want more of these families or do we want to pick ourselves up a bit, get a better education, and make society proud to have us live next door. I can't imagine how parents today can let young children watch tv. Early evening reruns of Two and a Half Men are really funny to me, but I don't want my 7 year old grandson hearing most of this info until he is much older. On Bones should a man and a woman obviously be having sex in a tent on an 8 0'clock show? Children aren't stupid. If woman is undressing a man in a tent, and later the tent is moving and rocking all over the sidewalk. Even a young child would start to get it and begin asking many premature questions that a curious 6 or 7 year old isn't ready for the question or the answer. THE DONNA REED SHOW is timeless good healthy family fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This show made me want to go on to college and make something out of myself. Rosanne and The Middle would make a person give up and do any menial job! GOOD FOR YOU DONNA AND THE VALUES YOU INSTILLED IN YOUR VIEWERS!!!!!!",1260403200,61,1896,4.284122562674095
4847726,4,B005NHZAXM,"Bought this so I could have the episode with James Darren in, my mom didn't really let me watch this show growing up so I was more familiar with Shelly through her teen movies.  The shows are rather old fashioned.",1466294400,,213,4.325

4847728,5,B005NHZAXM,"It's nice to be able to watch these old tv shows again.  It takes me back to a time when families were ""real"" and society was gentler and kinder than they are today.  Too bad America is no longer like it was back then.",1458172800,,218,3.9318181818181817
4847729,2,B005NHZAXM,"Not sure what was ""Lost"" about this. I had seen most of them on broadcast TV recently. A little disappointed.",1457913600,,109,4.5
4847730,5,B005NHZAXM,"Another wonderful season of classic entertainment! The thing that I love about this season is that Donna starts showcasing her comedic side a little more in episodes such as ""The Monster"" and ""The Caravan"". Another episode that stands out is ""One of Those Days"" in which Donna and Alex take the day off to spend time together. In the process, they not only reconnect, but develop a deeper sense of gratitude for each other, their family, and their many blessings. The world would be a happier place if more real-life families were like the Stone's.",1456790400,,548,4.778947368421052

4847736,4,B005NHZAXM,"Nice addition to my dvd collection. Havent seen the episodes in years. Donna Reed show was never played in reruns much either, except for a stint on Nick at Night some years ago. Donna was a fine actress and is missed. Stories depict the trials and tribulations of a family that is well off, with some touching episodes. Anyone under 30 probably never saw this show, and is a  cut above Leave it to Beaver for its realism, and a cut below Father Knows Best.",1449273600,,457,4.376470588235295

4847745,3,B005NHZAXM,"Does anyone else notice the negativity, hate, and venom this show launches into?  Was it trying to sell Alka-Seltzer during commercials?

My wife and I watch it just to count how long it takes Donna Reed to become irritated and disagreeable.  Sometimes the kids and Donna all go into b-mode together.  No wonder that dad is always stepping out and trying to escape to the hospital.

It tries to be a ""perfect family"" show, but this family is awful.  The series is filmed and written as if it was a leftover set of Coronet ""how to"" films famous for their stilted situations and dialogue and inhuman reactions within situations.  Funny in a not-intentional style.",1430784000,,661,4.745614035087719

4847747,5,B005NHZAXM,The special features make this season a must-buy!!  They have a documentary about how and why Paul and Shelley started their music careers and actually interview them.  Very interesting behind-the-scenes info and adds a lot to the show.  A must - even if you're not the biggest fan of the Donna Reed show.,1429747200,,305,4.716981132075472

Followers of the show might remember that back in the 1980s, Nick at Nite skipped this particular season in syndication -- they went from season 3 to 5. Well, they're all here, in excellent quality.

They act like any  regular family back then even the fighting kids do fight.  This season Jeff sings the  she cant find her keys an can he sing . and Amazon has his cd and Shelly Fabray's cd. I'm sure you  would be happy with all the season. oh and so far there was 2 commercial. they named the product told what it will do and that's i not even 3 minutes . and I remember what it was ,",1382745600,,661,3.652482269503546

And best of all not only are the Screen Gems closing credits fully intact (these are chopped off on Season 2), you also get some of original commercials and sponsor product graphics included on the opening and closing credits for many of the episodes. These goodies aren't listed as extras but to me are pure gold and about as close to watching the show as when it was originally broadcast as you could possibly get.",1379808000,3,689,4.512

4847786,5,B005NHZAXM,"Excellent collection of seldom seen episodes! Love the bonus features and ""ads"" still in place. A true time capsule! Recommened for all sitcom fans.",1342310400,,148,5.208333333333333
4847787,5,B005NHZAXM,"I remember this show very fondly, as a boomer born in 1953. Although my parents only permitted me to watch television if my homework was finished, and then, again, not past bedtime, I looked forward to watching the Stone family, along with  Hazel, Leave it to Beaver, Father Knows Best, Mr. Ed, Car 54 Where Are You? and the many other good sitcoms and shows of the late 50's and early 60's. Donna Stone, along with June Cleaver,the two most ""together"" moms on the planet, sure were a far cry from moms of today. Too much ""reality"" has really blighted us, the writing of comedy shows seems to have deteriorated, so is it surprising that so many are again (or for the first time) watching these great shows?

Donna Reed Show - Season 4 - The Lost Episodes is simply a wonderful venue into a relaxing and enjoyable evening, a real ""feel good"" factor if you have had a rough day and just want to unwind and smile.  As a young girl, I remember when Shelly Fabares' ""Johnny Angel"" 45 record came out, and, I played it again and again, singing along with her. Shelly was my idol, as we were similar in age, she slightly older, and my mother was forever chastising me to ""be more like Mary Stone"".

Shelly and ""Johnny Angel"" are featured in the Disc Three episode, ""Donna's Prima Donna"", and watching it (and again singing along with Shelly/Mary) really brought back warm memories. All of the 39 shows (yes 39 shows) are terrific, great family entertainment, truly bringing back a happy time (John F. Kennedy was President) when all was well with the world.

If you love good, old fashioned 60's TV, have memories of this great show, as I do, or are younger and have heard about them, I urge you to purchase this set, as well as some of the other seasons of The Donna Reed Show. Back when simpler was more fun.",1339200000,8,1803,4.451515151515151
4847788,5,B005NHZAXM,"LOVE THE 4TH SEASON! THE EPISODE""DONNA'S PRIMA DONA"" WITH MARY SINGING ""JOHNNY ANGEL"" IS PRICELESS. AND ""DR. STONE & HIS HORSELESS CARRIAGE"" IS GREAT,TOO. I HAVE A FRIEND WHO OWNS A MODEL A AND I HAVE TO GET HIM TO BUY THIS DVD. IN THE CRAZINESS AND STUPIDITY OF TODAY'S TV ""HITS"" THE DONNA REED SHOW RESTORES SANITY TO THE ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SET.",1332547200,5,376,4.626865671641791
4847789,4,B005NHZAXM,"I cannot express how wonderful I am enjoying watching this Season.  It is the fourth one I have watched again after many years of it not being available on TV.  I can hardly wait until Season 5 is released.  Our local Library also bought a copy, and so I am going to keep my copy for a long time.  It was and is the very best TV Sitcom that was every made during the late 50's and early 60's. I love Donna Reed, and all of the stars.  I have met Paul Peterson, and can hardly wait to see him sing ,MY DAD, which I think is probably on Season 5.  Thank you so very much for the opportunity to relive these precious memories of my childhood. My father passed away when I was only 30, and I remember our choir singing ""My Dad"" to my Dad for a special  event.  I danced with my Dad's oldest friend at my 25th Wedding anniversary and cried all the way through the song.  Of course what can I say I love JOhnny Angel and it was just a bonus to have Jimmy Darren on the first episode, as he was and still is a favorite.  He is hanging on my hallway wall in a photo from Gidget.

What a joy.  TV is just not like it usede to be.

Thank you, Gail",1330646400,6,1137,3.891304347826087
4847790,5,B005NHZAXM,"So many series from the 60's remind us of life how it was or how we wish it was.  Shows like Donna Reed, Father Knows Best, Leave it to Beaver, to name a few, will never be replaced or duplicated.",1330041600,4,196,3.9
4847791,4,B005NHZAXM,"But there are no ""lost"" episodes here. No Donna Reed Show episodes have ever been ""lost"". This is the last good season of a great series, the audio and video quality are superb and the price, while not cheap, is reasonable.",1329782400,,223,4.463414634146342
4847792,5,B005NHZAXM,"About the commercials MPI was very diplomatic they took care of every one. They put them in for all of you who like them and let us who don't like them skip right over them. Some shows don't have options. We either have to watch the commercials or fast forward. Great Thinking. About the show
itself. I love the Donna Reed Show, but Season 4 is a little
confusing in regards to Jeff and his grade in school. In ""New
Girl In Town"" Angie's father says that Jeff and Angie are in their second year of high school(when I was in high school that meant sophmore), but later in the season he was a junior which is third year. Jeff was a sophmore for 25 episodes and a Junior for the last 14 episodes. It was first mentioned of Jeff being a junior in ""The Fireball"". Nothing was mentioned of this change in any of the episodes. The episodes with
grades in them didn't show a smart enough student to be able to be bumped up a grade in the middle of the school year. Not to mention in Season 1 Jeff was in 6th Grade so rightfully he should only be in the 9th grade/first year of high school.
Jeff and Mary are supposed to be 2 years apart in age, but the latter part of this season has them 1 year apart in grade level. And what happened to the dog? Suddenly he was gone with no explaination. In one episode Jeff said he and Angie met ""Last"" year. But Jeff and Angie only met 5 months earlier, not ""Last"" year.",1329350400,3,1400,4.131868131868132

It was marvelous, so enjoyable and can't wait for season 5.
Hurry up and release season 5!",1326153600,2,173,4.8
4847804,5,B005NHZAXM,"Like many others, my primary experience with The Donna Reed Show involved watching it on Nick-At-Nite back when it anchored their original prime-time schedule. I recall the episodes looking crisp and clear and they always showed the end credits right to the Screen Gems ID at the very end. Remember when channels still showed complete end credits?

I was very happy when I discovered the series was finally getting released on DVD. I purchased the first season set and wasn't entirely impressed by the quality of the content. The episodes looked nothing like I remembered from Nick. The images were murky and muddy with very poor sound quality. I did take a chance on the second season, hoping that the distributors would have learned from their mistakes, but that release was just as disappointing. I chose not to even bother with season three.

When I discovered that MPI was releasing the fourth season I thought I'd give the show one last chance. That was a wise decision for me as this season four set is head and shoulders above the previous releases. The image quality is much better than the other seasons (though, I have to say, they still looked better on Nick... sorry, just MHO). MPI has also chosen to add some great extras including a new interview with Shelley Fabares and Paul Petersen and a feature on season four as the ""musical season"" (as the producers decided to add music to some shows to keep up with Ozzie & Harriet). I was also happily surprised to find some episodes have their original commercials intact. This is kind of cool as it gives me, someone who wasn't around for the original run, a chance to see the show as it was originally aired on ABC (and probably hasn't been shown since). One episode, ""Donna Meets Roberta"", was apparently created to introduce a spinoff series that would feature Gale Gordon. This episode runs a whopping 31 minutes!

All and all this season four DVD set should please most fans of the Donna Reed Show. Bring on season five MPI!",1326067200,9,1990,4.696275071633238
4847805,5,B005NHZAXM,"After reading so many other positive reviews, what could I possibly say that hasn't been said already about a show that I grew up with and have remembered fondly ever since.  Donna Reed was so sweet, and Alex, Mary and Jeff were perfectly cast to fit the mold of our all-around American family.  Call it corny by today's standards if you wish but, to me, it was real then and, for many of us, it remains real today.  Great series all around.  Just got my DVD copy of Season 4 and I can't wait to watch the Johnny Angel episode.  I was almost eleven years old when it originally aired and I've been yearning to own a video copy ever since.  Thanks so much for making it available.  Keep up the good work, and please keep the remaining Donna Reed episodes coming!",1325894400,4,761,4.316901408450704
4847806,4,B005NHZAXM,"This is my favorite season to date. They were so good, I watched the entire season in one sitting and wondered why it seemed so short. The vintage commercials from Campbell Soup and Johnson and Johnson was a bonus treat. I wish each episode had the commercials.",1325808000,5,261,4.574468085106383
4847807,5,B005NHZAXM,Had pre-ordered my DVD set of The Donna Reed Show Season 4 and it arrived today. Just in time for Christmas! I have watched a few of the episodes and spot checked the discs for quality and I am happy to report that the audio and video quality do not disappoint. You will happy in buying this set. The special features are a plenty and makes it that much more to enjoy. The cover photo of The Stones and the title typeset on the cover stay true to the early 1960s broadcasts of this wonderful TV show. And you will be pleased to know that there is a listing of the original date of broadcast for each episode inside the case. MPI you did a great job! Mary Owen thank you for putting so much time and effort into making this DVD release happen. I sure am looking forward to the release of the next season too!,1324598400,9,807,4.146496815286624
4847808,5,B005NHZAXM,"Just purchased this set last Tuesday. It comes in the paramount
style plastic case. MPI did a great job restoring these episodes,
with great picture quality (i'm picky), and decent sound. There
could be a slight improvement on the sound quality but I won't hold
that against them considering the rarety of the episodes.
There is a great bonus feature with Stu Phillips who produced the
Shelley and Paul and James Darren recording sessions. Plus you see
Shelley and Paul together today discussing the show, and their hit
records. I hope MPI releases season 5. There are more songs, plus
more fun with Donna.",1324512000,11,606,4.836538461538462

4847810,5,B005NHZAXM,"The first thing I'd like to do in this review is clarify exactly what we're getting in this release. There has been some confusion as to just exactly what this release is all about. Because MPI and the Reed/Owen estate have decided to name this the ""The Lost Episodes"", consumers are confused as to whether this is just a compilation of random Season 4 installments--rest assured it's not. ALL 39 episodes from the series' fourth season which aired on ABC during 1961-62 are included, UNCUT and restored. They are of much better quality than the previous releases by Virgil Films who put out Seasons 1-3 in 2008-09. (NOTE: Check out the screen captures I uploaded in the Images section of this product). MPI is a much more professional company--just look at that gorgeous cover art! Yes, when it comes to MPI you CAN judge a DVD set by its cover! The 5 discs are housed in a clear plastic case just like MPI's wonderful sets of ""Here's Lucy"".

These episodes have not been part of the ""Donna Reed"" syndication package since the 1970s and were never seen on Nick@Nite when they aired the show from 1985-94. One of the most sought-after episodes where Shelley Fabares performs ""Johnny Angel"" is included--an outstanding artifact from the early '60s.

Many episodes have the original sponsor openings and closings intact. Several episodes are presented in their COMPLETE form with all original commercials and sponsor openings and closings so the viewing experience is exactly as though you were watching it on ABC in prime time in 1961!

The set includes a wealth of bonus features including vintage promos and commercials and new interviews with Paul Petersen and Shelley Fabares as well as Stu Phillips who produced the songs Paul and Shelley performed on the show.

Thanks to MPI and Mary Owen, this is the best Christmas present ever for Donna fans!",1318896000,34,1851,4.848101265822785

4847812,5,B005NHZAXM,"What the sub-title ""The Lost Episodes"" is probably referring to is that nearly this entire season was skipped by Nick at Nite through every run of the series in the '80s and early '90s.  Time after time, they skipped from season 4's episode #2 (""A Rose is a Rose"") to episode #2 of season 5, (""Mrs. Stone and Dr. Hyde""), thus skipping Mary's debuting ""Johnny Angel"" on the February 1, 1962 episode (about a week after it debuted on Billboard's Hot 100).  After that, Nick skipped all of Season 6 and 7 (with the odd exception of ""What Are Friends For?"" which aired November 28, 1963, episode 6.11), skipping the half-dozen scattered episodes Shelley Fabares did after leaving the regular cast (a la Don Knotts on ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW) as well as most of Bob Crane's run as Dr. Dave Kelsey prior to HOGAN'S HEROES--jarringly resuming two years later with the first episode of Season 8, ""Pop Goes Theresa"" (9/16/65).  So, should someone get the rights to issue seasons 6 and 7, they too could legitimately be billed as ""Lost Episodes.""",1317254400,58,1031,4.685082872928176
