7909124,5,B00000GKO8,"In this trio of episodes from ""All in the Family"" it is not only Archie's conservatism but also Mike's liberal views that are sorely tested.  In ""Judging Books by Covers"" (Episode #5 February 9 1971) Archie assumes that because Mike's friend Roger is intellectual and somewhat effeminate, he must be gay.  But it turns out that while Roger is straight, Steve, the manly guy down at the bar, is not.  The other two episodes on this tape bring the battle of the sexes to the Bunker household as Gloria sorely tried Mike's liberal views.  In ""Gloria Discovers Women's Lib"" (#11 March 23 1971) Archie's daughter discovers that Mike's views on sexual equality are not what she expected.  As a result, she leaves home for a while and Archie is mad that the wrong person in the marriage left his home.  Then there is ""Gloria Poses in the Nude"" (#15 25 September 1971), where Gloria agrees to be painted by one of Mike's friends.  Archie is dead set against the idea, Edith is embarrassed, and Mike keeps telling himself he does not mind.  Yeah, right.  One of the nice things about these three episodes from early in ""All in the Family,"" is that they remind you that even from the start the show skewered Liberal views as well as Conservative as both Archie and Mike have their beliefs punctured by friends and family alike.  All three episodes also contain great ensemble work by the talented cast, led by the late Carroll O'Connor.",993340800,,1426,4.645418326693227
