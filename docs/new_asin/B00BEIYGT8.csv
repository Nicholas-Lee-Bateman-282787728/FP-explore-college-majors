5585926,2,B00BEIYGT8,"By the year 2022 the US government, led by our New Founding Fathers, has managed to crawl its way out of a triple dip recession and record crime rates. Unemployment stands at 1%, and crime is at an all time low. With one exception. Once a year, on a date designated as The Purge, for twelve hours all crime is legal. Rape, murder, theft, the entire US has a free pass to do whatever they wish and suffer no repercussions for it. In a single day thousands are murdered and millions of dollars worth of property destroyed in order to give everyday American's an outlet to vent their rage, anger, and frustrations in the hope that they will ""cleanse their souls"" and not be tempted to commit crimes for the rest of the year.

First of all let's put aside the fact that the premise at face value makes absolutely no sense. I'll let that slide, though I do feel it needs to be said. The premise is what it is, and as implausible as it is, I still thought it interesting enough to warrant a look. But even overlooking  this, the movie has some serious flaws that I felt wasted what could have been a very intelligent film. First of all, this film is produced by the same people who brought us great horror movies like the Paranormal Activity movies, Insidious and Sinister, and while I loved those movies this film should have been different. The premise screams suspense thriller, as instead of dealing with supernatural beings like in their previous films, the main baddies in this one are a bunch of teenagers in masks and an old homeless man. To put it simply, there is nothing even remotely scary about this movie, so the fact that they filmed it like a horror movie with the typical horror movie tropes, jump scares, loud music, etc  only served as a distraction both for the director and the audience from what should have been the main focus. These sort of things worked for Sinister and Insidious because of their supernatural elements, because the villains were invisible, evil forces that couldn't be talked to or reasoned with. This film doesn't have that. Instead we have some homeless guy wandering around an inexplicably enormous house for an hour while the idiot family that lives there stumbles around in the dark. Am I honestly supposed to be scared by this? The Purge is a thriller in a horror movies clothing, and ultimately in my opinion fails horribly at being either.

But what about The Purge itself? Do we get to see the streets turn into battle grounds? Is there subtle yet engaging social commentary to go along with such an interesting premise? Sadly, no. I don't know what these producers deal is with filming well off families in big houses, but this story should have really been told from the POV of someone who is poor and, thus, unable to afford protection from the roaming bands of psychotic rich kids trying to kill them. This is what should have been the focus of the film, not some boring rich family with first world problems, but the poor and downtrodden who are the real victims of this sick tradition. Imagine a film where a poor, single mother/father flees with their children from bands of killers who are not only allowed to kill at will, but encouraged to do so as well. That would have been a great movie. Instead we get boring suburban dad with boring suburban wife, and boring suburban kids. Nothing gets my heart strings strumming like privileged rich people trying to throw some poor homeless guy to the wolves. Yeah, I feel real sorry for those guys.

The Purge is a film that had a great idea but no idea how to see it through. Its boring, badly directed, and commits the cardinal sin of being a horror movie that isn't even remotely scary. If you really want to see it, wait until its on netflix and stream it. Otherwise, my suggestion is to pass. Its really not worth the effort.",1370217600,139,3828,4.550072568940493

5586179,2,B00BEIYGT8,"In an idealized future version of America, we vent our national frustration on one golden night, in which all crime up to and including murder is legal and the results are somehow televised. Apparently it works, because violence is supposedly down and employment is way up, but there is the tricky issue of surviving that single naughty holiday without passing through the crosshairs of an enemy. As a concept, The Purge is ripe. Especially so today, four years after its release, when the nation seems as politically and culturally divided as ever and violent undercurrents are simmering. There's so much opportunity to toy with the metaphorical overtone (including one or two extra-interesting caveats about the event itself which are left unexplored) that it's amazing they're merely used to prop up a rather generic horror/suspense combo. Family makes a series of poor choices. Bad guys show up on their doorstep to make threats and embrace modern horror stereotypes. Big showdown with a few telegraphed twists. That's the jist. The allure of the Purge, and the nationwide embrace of what it means, is right there, just begging to be further mined, but instead it's relegated to mere background color. An excuse not to call the police, really, and nothing more. Despite an inspired (and, go figure, largely unexplored) take by Rhys Wakefield as the charismatic gang leader, this is some bland, uniform stuff.",1520640000,,1412,5.116883116883117

5586283,3,B00BEIYGT8,"It may be a nice story idea, but then the movie doesn't seem logical. If there is one day that even murder is legal, and the youngster wanted to kill a family because they let a homeless guy in, then the neighbors would simply enjoy it and stay home, trying to keep their life. They will not come out, first kill those youngsters, so that they can kill the family themselves. Do people want to kill that much just because the neighbor made more money and made their house bigger? I don't think people have that much hatred, so much that they will risk their own life to kill the youngsters and then kill the family.

Also, if the life of the whole family depended on the security system, do you think it made even a tiny bit of sense that the father will let the son know the security code to open the gate? The son who seemed barely old enough to be grade 9 in school?

The movie seemed to follow some formulas: a son making some weird robot toy going around the house. The son made a tiny mistake to let a guy in, and risk the life of the whole family. The guy wanted to send the homeless guy out, but all of a sudden, he felt ""it wasn't right"" and risk all their life. The homeless guy finally saved the wife and the kids, and on and on. It look very much like a formula.",1512345600,,1274,4.092

5586487,2,B00BEIYGT8,"The idea was intriguing. But too many situations left me wondering about the logic of it all. The characters are doing things that, I believe, no one would ever do in similar situations. Also, the son keeps doing things that made me angry. His intentions were surely good but the screenwriters should have found something else cause when you're left hating some of the characters, it doesnt help the movie. The wife and daughter are also completely illogical at times (in their actions and in their intentions). Lastly, the idea of the purge, although interesting on a metaphorical level, just doesnt make any sense on a logical one. I didn't buy the reasons for it and too many situations are questionable. The fact that you decide to kill doesnt make you invincible. Therefore, to simply walk in the street is just plain stupid. You can get shot from a distance anytime. The killers that we follow act like no one in the house is armed. They simply enter and roam around, dancing, singing, without protecting themselves. And in a situation like the purge, why are bands of tugs trusting each other? A lot of those plot holes could have been avoided with a simple line or a simple scene here and there. To conclude, the suspense is certainly fun, the theme is interesting as a metaphor but too many dumb and questionable situations and intentions are ruining everything.",1499644800,,1371,4.764705882352941

5587058,3,B00BEIYGT8,"The unique angle of this film isn't really delved into other than setting up for your standard home invasion film which ultimately is a pretty weak and not that interesting one compared to Straw Dogs (original version), Fear and well most films in this genre. There didn't even really seem to be any real motivation to why those outside would risk their lives storming a fortified building when they don't know what weapons (or even people) await them inside.  I was waiting for some big reveal that the homeless guy, wasn't just a homeless guy or Ethan Hawke's character, his daughter, wife or someone had actually done something that means they need to be killed during this opportunity, but nothing like that was ever revealed.  Surely there were plenty more other people that could be purged outside they could find during the time they waste waiting to be handed this particular one.

The action on the streets of America under the whole, all crime is legal for 12hours, was what the movie needed to concentrate on.  There's two sequels to this film and even though I found this film extremely disappointing, I find the 12 hour purge concept interesting enough that I'll check them out.  I just hope we actually delve into it in those sequels.  For example I was wondering why you wouldn't just go on a holiday each year on the date of the purge to Canada, Europe, well wherever isn't America. Surely that would be cheaper than getting a security system installed.  The only reason I could see this couldn't happen would be if Americans aren't allowed to travel overseas anymore and are shot trying to cross the border or sneaking away on boats or whatever. If they can still travel does America not extradite citizens to face charges for crimes that occur on the date of a purge?  I also wondered what happens with hospitals?  Surely they would be immune, but then again the sick and weak being removed from society were one of the reasons for the purge. So do staff just walk away from the hospital until the siren sounds when it should be safe to return?  If it is immune wouldn't thousands of people just flock there?  There's just so many holes in the concept of the yearly purge that aren't addressed in this film.

Plus why would you spend all this money on a security system that has no emergency lighting or even a generator if the power is cut?  Wouldn't you have some strategic points in the house you could set up to hide behind while you can fire on those coming through the entrance? Wouldn't your security system come with heavily armed response security that you could also call if people were trying to get in?  Especially when the whole street has the same security company system installed.

For me the sheer stupidity of the family members made this hard viewing.  The son (who I actually thought was a little girl before he spoke) disabling the security system then never grasping the whole, if your family don't find him they're going to be all wiped out concept. Why did the daughter run off to other parts of the house, when obviously safety would have been with her family.  How big is this house that doesn't look that huge from the outside, be that you can't find people for ages?

As I said the concept of the yearly purge intrigues me enough to check out the sequels, but I can't say I'd bother recommending this first movie to anyone, when there's so many better home invasion alternatives out there.",1478822400,2,3435,4.621710526315789

SPOILERS:

This family acts as if it's the first time this allowed violence has happened,  It's the EIGHTH time, in eight years,  They have a beautiful upper story that would have made a fantastic sniper's nest.  The house had the high ground, but no fence at all.  The creepy idiots that went after the family mainly had melee weapons; half were dressed in what seemed like nightgowns.  A sniper could have easily taken them out.
For that matter, since murder is legal for this night, why did they even let them step one foot on the property?  Take 'em out right away- no problem.
The few intruders that had guns mainly had shotguns or handguns.  Again, nothing a good sniper couldn't handle, especially with the high ground.
Oh, and they have a state of the art surveillance system, which would have been great, if they had some one to man it, instead of being away from the console most of the time.
Except for the father, most of the other family members didn't seem to have too much training with their weapons.  If the purge were the case, I'd have the family at the range at least once a week.  Plus, he has a very nice assortment of weapons to choose from, and what does he take?  A six shot revolver.  There was at least one scoped rifle and a shotgun in there, if I'm recalling correctly.
Why didn't they have floodlights to blind intruders and a couple of large well trained dogs? (If they really wanted to get serious about this, they could do what the Pentagon does- snip their vocal chords.  Before you get upset, I don't condone the idea, but we're going with the extreme scenarios now.)
I'm not even going to start addressing the idiot son that started the trouble they had in the first place.
There are so many other things wrong, I could write a novel about it, but if you want to take a chance, do it.  I'd actually recommend you watch the second and third purge movies instead.  They're marginally better.",1475193600,2,2038,4.575757575757576

5587654,4,B00BEIYGT8,"Given the shrill, overbaked, hyperbolic language that passes for debate between the Right and the Left these days, it's no wonder that the best place to address politics in film may be the horror genre.

Enter writer-director James DeMonaco's The Purge, a genuinely tense, effective home-invasion thriller starring Ethan Hawke ( The Woman in the Fifth) and Lena Headey ( Game of Thrones) that opens Friday.

A genre picture on its grisly, gritty outside, The Purge tries, not always successfully, to mount a critique of America's culture of violence and our growing obsession with wealth, which according to the film, has robbed us of our last shreds of compassion and empathy.

Heavy-handed? Perhaps, but the film is surprisingly effective.

The Purge is set in an alternate America that has solved its economic problems by instituting an annual ritual called the Purge: For 12 hours beginning at 7 p.m. every March 21, Americans are free to commit any crime. There will be no cops, ambulances, or fire engines on the streets, and no prosecution will follow once the dust settles.

The Purge saves America! It reduces unemployment and gets the economy going in a brutally efficient way: Once a year, the country is cleansed of all the poor, destitute, weak people who can't take care of themselves, all the parasites who live off the government's largesse.

It's Social Darwinism gone wild.

Hawke and Headey are very good as an upper-middle-class couple who made their money selling elite security systems - like the rest of the upper-crust, they can shut out the Purge with heavily fortified walls.

Things go horribly wrong when their son Charlie (Max Burkholder) gives in to empathy and lets a homeless drifter (Edwin Hodge) hide in the house. The film goes from tense to psychotic when a group of prep school kids lays siege to the house, demanding they be allowed to kill the drifter. Should the family protect the weak, or turn him out?

DeMonaco sneaks in the film's political message using RoboCop director Paul Verhoeven's tried-and-true method: The action is foregrounded against a constant stream of news reports, talk shows, and public-service ads, including ""Purge Feeds,"" live footage of gangs of hunters killing and torturing fellow human beings. The dead are eulogized for their ""sacrifice.""

In its own clumsy, exaggerated way, The Purge takes a strong stand against our cultural obsession with violence and our tendency to conflate justice with vengeance.",1474588800,,2475,5.088888888888889

5587741,3,B00BEIYGT8,"In what is easily one of the most inventive and interesting premises recent memory, the 'New Founding Fathers"" have instituted an annual 12-hour holiday that they call ""The Purge"". during the Purge all crime including murder is made legal (with the exception of high ranking government officials of course). The film toys with some big ideas including how this keeps our current system of income inequality in place as the rich get an opportunity to kill off the poor and homeless, thus keeping tension off the social safety net. This could have been a truly interesting exploration of systemic racism and class warfare...but instead it squanders it's promise and becomes a typical home invasion movie.

The cast lead by Ethan Hawke, Lena Headey and a villianous Rhys Wakefield do a fine job with the material. This is especially true of Wakefield, who is delightfully creepy and hammy. The two child actors in the film, as well as the homeless man at the center of the conflict, are all serviceable but are given very little to do.

The story centers around Hawke and Headey's family as they lock down and settle in to ride out the Purge in relative safety. There is a quickly abandoned subplot with the eldest daughter and her boyfriend that is resolved and has next to no bearing on the rest of the film. The movie then devolves into a snooze-fest as the main cast attempt to find a homeless man in the dark for 20 minutes in order to escape the wrath of a group of wealthy young purgers led by Wakefield. When time runs out the film picks up some steam before it's anticlimactic denouement.

The purge is by the numbers home invasion movie that squanders it's premise...and if those numbers were being read like this 1...............2..............3........it's super dull and at times very random. The son has some wierd quirks that add nothing and have no payoff. Hawke's character is boring and out of nowhere becomes frickin Rambo for the last 10 minutes of the film.

It's not a terrible film but it isn't cerebral enough to be this slow.",1474156800,,2047,4.75774647887324

The concept is good but the movie lacks originality from the onset and some of the behavior of those inside and outside of the home isn't believable. I really wish directors would get away from using formulas when making movies and rely more on the originality of the script and/or book.

The son, daughter, and boyfriend were very unlikable and could have been the demise of this movie, but the plot and pace were able to overcome their annoying characters.

5589149,4,B00BEIYGT8,"I love the concept, the execution (pun intended) was pretty good, acting is solid.  Some people have said this movie was disappointing because it wasn't what it appeared to be, but it met my expectations.  With a premise as loaded as the one here, you'd have to expect that there would be more to it than gratuitous violence, and that's exactly what you get.  I think the way the characters interact and the way the story plays out says a lot about the current state of American society, especially when you consider recent events.  If you go into it with today's hot issues (gun-control, rampant violence, ""affluenza,"" etc) in mind, it'll paint a frightening picture we can only hope stays a work of fiction.",1467676800,,709,4.693548387096774

5589381,5,B00BEIYGT8,"It's ironic that the director is anti-gun when this is one of the most pro-gun movies I have ever seen. Think about it? Who has a fighting chance? The people with guns. Who's able to say ""no more killing tonight"" to her now disarmed neighbors? The woman who's being backed up by a homeless man holding a gun.

What does this movie shows? It shows that a security system with concrete walls is useless when your enemy brings a truck with a cable to pull off that wall. It shows that you can't depend on the government, you have to depend on yourself. It's true that one of the heroes dies, but he was able to kill many before he did.

It's also heartening that a family full of people that didn't want to purge ended up purging. Of course, it wasn't senseless violence but self-defense.

With that said, it's unrealistic to think that making all crime legal for 12-hours a year would lower the crime rate. If you're a drug dealer, you're dealing when you have merchandise, you're killing your competitors/enemies when they get in your way. What the Purge movie seems to be saying is that law-abiding people can't wait to become criminals. That good old frat boys can't wait to murder and rape, that behind ever upstanding member of society hides a savage waiting to get out, and by allowing him to release the beast once a year, he'll be a nice person the rest of the year.

I don't believe that. I believe that most people are good. I'm not a gun owner because I fear 100% of the people, just the 5-1% who choose crime.",1467417600,,1519,4.414285714285715

 Although it sounds ridiculous at face value, the director/actors did a fairly good job at making the main premise- that the government has deemed one night per year a free-for-all for all citizens to commit unlawful acts without any consequence- believable. The reasoning behind why this night came into existence (to allow citizens a chance to take out their inner aggression lawfully in order to prevent them from committing bad acts throughout the rest of the year) makes no real sense, but they sold it pretty well as being logical to the characters in the film.

However, I found the way the plot played out to be a bit over-the-top, a tad too violent to be truly entertaining (I'm not a fan of violence, especially unnecessary gore), and not all that unexpected. I think more twists could have been involved instead of following the basic home invasion film equation in order to match the level of creativity the premise brought to the table. I wouldn't call it a total waste of time, but wouldn't watch it again. I would say it's completely average in all ways but two- the acting and the premise itself.

The biggest problem is that none of the characters are really likable.  You never get a chance to get to know them, or understand what their broader motivations are, etc. and they don't do anything redeeming. So you don't care if they die.

Next, the children are stupid, and have confused intentions. They just keep splitting up, when it would make more sense to stay together, etc.

5590919,4,B00BEIYGT8,"The Purge Universal Pictures 2013 Rated R DVD version
OMG.  Both the front and back cover of the DVD suggested this might be a slasher horror film, catering perhaps to the worst impulse of human nature: sadism.  I was pleased to find it was far better than that, though don't go viewing it expecting to see the next ""Gone With The Wind"".
Lets start with the basics.  Its rated R and it warrants R due to scenes of violence including murder, though there is no excess unnecessary blood nor scenes of mutilation.  The use of expletives is fairly minimal and of nudity, none (nothing more than you would see on an average beach).
The story takes place in 2022.  That the screenplay must have been written well prior to 2013 and post-2008 and the world-wide financial crisis lends its backstory some credibility.  It still remains plausible today, since the whole world still seems to have financial-withdrawal shakes.  The story takes place entirely in the US, so what has become of the rest of the world is not mentioned.

Early in the film we're told the US went on to experience a financial crisis far worse than 2008 resulting in rioting and virtual anarchy.  Following the next election the new government did a radical re-think of what society needed.  It concluded that since aggression is an essential element of human beings, in order to prevent recurring wars or a constant level of violent crime, some new element in our social fabric was needed.  Thus was born The Purge, a 12 hour period from 7 PM to 7 AM occurring once per year, in which all crimes including murder were permitted (exempting naturally, crimes against government officials above a certain level!)  The theory was that, secure in the notion that they could seek revenge at a later date, people would better control their aggression for the rest of the year.  It had the additional side-effects of eliminating from society those least able to defend themselves and probably also the least productive, lowering unemployment and increasing economic growth.

So the story begins just before the onset of the annual purge in 2022.  The lead couple are good actors: Ethan Hawke as father and Lena Headey as mother of an upper-middle class family in a gated community.  They have a late-teen daughter and an early-teen son who also play prominent roles.  It just so happens that Hawkess character James Sandin was project leader on the latest and greatest in home security systems to defend against the anarchy of the Purge, and they did very well financially in the past year.  Of course they have it installed on their own home too.

In the hour leading up to the purge people seem remarkably sanguine (at least in this gated community, in which everyone has installed security systems.  Even in the last minutes before 7 PM, Sandin and family seem non-credibly calm and nonchalant.  This was the first tremor in the production: I don't care how good a home security system I had, under those circumstances I really don't think I would be preoccupied with watching TV news or running on a treadmill!  Regardless, early on this film plants quite a number of clues to the future plot, some of which pan out true and some of which are red herrings [just see if you can figure out which are which, without being told!]

Theres a part of the fun: seeing how much of the plot you can figure before it unfolds, and how sure you feel about your guesses.  Then compare them to the results!  Guessing who will still be alive and who will have died by the end of the film is only one part of this jigsaw puzzle.

Now let me switch to the downsides of the film.  There is nothing new or spectacularly good about the cinematography.  It was competent.  There was nothing really outstanding about the musical score.  It seemed to be tense and brooding to one degree or another pretty much throughout, but was unobtrusive.  The acting is good.  The dialog is pretty good.  The editing: ah theres the rub!  At times I felt there was too much aimless wandering back and forth in the house and cutting from scene to scene, which I suppose was meant to illustrate a familys confusion in an unexpected situation and the chaotic nature of unfolding events, but at times all this did was annoy me as a viewer.  I think the film would have been improved by more careful editing of the scenes to prune away what was annoying without contributing to the story.

Overall as I watched, I was surprised how much this film resonated with Night of the Living Dead by Romero.  Not that there were any zombies in this movie, because there are not.  Rather, both the general structure of the scenes and in the underlying issues it poses to a viewer are much like NOLD.  People trapped in a house?  Check.  A black person among whites?  Check.  Therefore, race relations?  Check.  Economic divides?  Check.  Whether violence or compassion wins out?  Check.
Of course compared to NOLD this has the benefits of a better budget, full-color and higher resolution filming, and more proficient actors.  In short, I felt its a remarkably well-done and thoughtful movie posing as a horror film.  For those who can stomach a tense movie, this is worth watching",1447113600,5,5189,4.698447893569845

5591407,5,B00BEIYGT8,"When I saw the reviews of The Purge I was hesitant to see it. However I literally just watched and I liked it quite a lot. One of things for me that makes this movie good is that it has an actual original idea and while this movie doesn't technically classify as horror it genuinely scared and disturbed me, something that any type of movie that classifies as horror rarely does nowadays. The idea that an event like The Purge could actually happen in the future is quite disturbing and suspenseful, the fact that you would have an actual chance of getting seriously hurt or killed or watching other people get killed is disturbing and the fact that some people you might actually know like the neighbors having it out for you. I may sound like I'm repeating myself but I'm not sure how else to put it. The acting was also very well done and you actually care about the main family involved and there are a few surprises along the way. Is the movie perfect? No, it had a very good idea but it could've been executed a bit better, I felt like it should've been a bit longer just to build the suspense and get more of a grasp of the idea of the purge but those are only minor gripes. And the fact that a movie like the Conjuring, a type of movie that's been done a million times, can do really well with the critics but a movie like the purge that has an actual original idea can't is ludicrous to me.",1441411200,,1399,4.2434456928838955

It is a low-budget thriller with a few nice ideas that could have been executed in a better way. It is not that the film is a terrible mess. It is rather that the film failed to fully exploit its potential as a thriller or political satire.

James DeMonacos The Purge is basically a home invasion thriller like The Desperate Hours, Funny Games and Panic Room. The difference is that the main events take place during the twelve hours of the Annual Purge, when every crime including murder is legalized. The story is set in the near future, when the United States is ruled by a new totalitarian government.

Ethan Hawke plays James Sandin, a successful businessman and family man of two children and wife Mary (Lena Headey). The rich family is going to spend the night of the Purge together in a fancy house protected by a security system  the same one James has sold to the neighbors. A homeless person has managed to get inside the house, however, and that makes Jamess family a target of the gun-wielding strangers.

Writer / director James DeMonaco (writer of remake Assault on Precinct 13 and co-writer of The Negotiator) has intended to make a thriller with a moral message. Thats fine, but the film itself is not as thrilling or insightful as it should, with stock characters making unaccountable decisions, and old hackneyed storytelling devices like criminals taking pause to say something unnecessarily before doing what they do.

As a mindless low-budget thriller The Purge is just OK, though, of course, it wants to be something more than that.",1438300800,,1662,4.756944444444445

First off you have to suspend disbelief for the premise because the only way this could ever happen is if Satan himself was the President of the United States. One night, twelve hours for the populous to do whatever they want. Arson, rape, murder all on the docket and government sanctioned.
Great premise and, as I said, could have played out it many different ways. It was kind of predictable but there are so many moments that will make you, I repeat make you question what you would do in this situation. That's what makes this movie above average.

5591840,3,B00BEIYGT8,"As has been said by others, the concept of the movie was interesting but the execution was flawed. To me, the most outrageous scene was the following:
When the Sandin family is about to be killed by the yuppie purgers, they are saved in the nick of time by their neighbors. However, it turns out that the neighbors killed the yuppie purgers only to that they themselves (the neighbors) could purge themselves by killing the Sandin family.
Mr. Sandin (the husband & father) is a sales clerk who sells home security systems and he has made a bunch of money selling such systems to practically every family in the neighborhood. With this money, he has built a luxurious addition onto the Sandin home and the neighbors are jealous, feeling that they're the ones who actually paid for the addition. That is the reason why the neighbors want to kill the Sandin family.
Anyway, after dispatching the yuppie purgers, the neighbors are holding the Sandins at gunpoint and about to blow them all away. Well, not exactly all; they only have three family members, the father, the mother and the son; the daughter is missing. Again, in the nick of time, somebody shoots the neighbor who was about to shoot the Sandins. That somebody turns out to be the missing daughter.
In the confusion, the mother grabs a gun and now is holding the neighbors at gunpoint. The neighbors are expecting to be killed in retaliation; they're pretty stoic about it and only ask that it been done quickly. Now here comes the sickening part. Instead of doing the necessary thing, the mother says, Theres been enough killing. And she lets the neighbors live, even though she knows (or should know) that the neighbors hate the Sandins and that theyll be sure to try again during next years Purge. Even if shes willing to take the chance on being next years Purge victim, what about the danger to her children, whom she claims to love so much? I felt that the scene was totally unrealistic and was taking political correctness or Christian forgiveness to an extreme.",1436745600,3,2028,4.715492957746479

5591928,3,B00BEIYGT8,Hardly the classic it wanted to be. Think Farenheit 451 and Clockwork Orange and what else? The kid with the small tank with a burned up doll body was very annoying just like the kid in The Walking Dead. I know they are meant to be but those indulged kids always get on my nerves. And the movie turns out to be some liberal Rich vs the Poor political drama. And the poor homeless guy is even BLACK. The very wealthy people are of course WHITE. The thugs outside are wanna be thugs from something like Clockwork Orange. I'm no film critic but this is what I got from my viewing. I think the second movie is better simply because they don't spend the entire movie in a house and it isn't as plodding and predictable. And by Farenheit 451 I just mean the movie tried to be cutting edge and clever showing us a new United States with a new political system. In Farenheit 451 books were outlawed. The Purge was about a concession and giving in to man's animal instinct.,1434672000,,964,4.302197802197802

There were just several things that occurred during the movie that just didn't make sense.  With that said I do not want to get to specific and ruin it for others who haven't seen the movie yet.  I just thought a movie starring Ethan Hawke would have a much better story line.  Lets just say the movie is pretty predictable.

5592314,2,B00BEIYGT8,"The Purge
 This movie is not worth your time.
 Still with me?  We have a solid cast of young and not so young pros who are very convincing in their roles.  Long time actor Ethan Hawke has the lead as the husband/father in the Sandin family.  He sells security systems for a living, which is a good business because in the future there is an annual holiday which makes all crimes, including murder, perfectly all right.  Hawke, as James Sandin, tries his very best to save his family from the chaos of The Purge.  English actress Lena Headley-who we love to hate as Cersei Lanister in the HBO series Game of Thrones, is his wife Mary.  They have two children, a tween boy played by Max Burkholder and a fifteenish girl played by 22 year old Australian actress Adelaide Kane.  Both the youngsters have already racked up an impressive string of movie, TV and even voice roles.  The acting is quite good all in all.  The older daughter is a brat, a self centered girl who wants only her older-too old- boyfriend.  Her younger brother is a bright but disturbed child doing his best to cope with life.
 The story is preposterous, and I say that after having reviewed Epic, a tale about a girl who shrinks into a world of living flowers and fairies.  We enter the story in year 10 of a period of stability and prosperity enlivened by a once a year killing binge, The Purge.  The opening credits show many, many people being murdered by blunt instrument, by blade, by gun and even by simple beating.  We know just what we are getting into but we have already paid our money.
 The action sequences are harrowing, up close, intense and realistic.  The game father engages a gang of periodic psychopaths in defense of his mate and cubs.  He shoots some of them and beats others to death with pocket pool equipment.  Question for James DeMonaco, the writer/director, if James has known about the night of The Purge for 10 years, why isn't he better prepared?  The family members separate so each can be endangered while all alone.  Who would do that?  A wise family would bond with each other at the shooting range in between the annual bloodletting and be both fierce and armed to the eyeballs.
 The whole thing is too stupid to be enjoyable for me.  But how did this one saw blade disaster manage to get made at all-and by Hollywood professionals mind you, not some film school kids with hand held cameras?  The producer is Michael Bay, the director of the Transformer films and the excellent Armageddon.  He is co-owner of Platinum Dunes, a film production company that specializes in re-making schlock horror flicks like Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003).  This R (graphic violence) rated film was made on a tiny budget of three million dollars.  It is projected to take in about $20 million in the opening weekend.  I think that answers the question of why was it made.",1430179200,,2859,4.581854043392505

5592480,5,B00BEIYGT8,I am not into sick picture about killing for no reason. This picture actual has a reason. Set in the future where a new government takes power and they stop crime and the country makes money. Turns out there is very little violence. So one day they are able to Purge for 12 hours. Crime is legal. Killing is allowed. This film follows one family who locks up there house and tries to avoid the killing. Of course things do not go there way when there son allows a person into there locked down house. Now they have crazed killers who want to Purge on them. Plus there is a boyfriend of the daughter inside who wants to kill the father. A pretty good film that makes you think what would you sacrifice to save your family. Is this government right?

If this situation were to really happen, it is not the poor who would fear for their lives but the rich, the police, the politicians, and the media.  Yes this film does suck in other ways too....horrible  acting, bad plot, dull and predictable but its biggest offense is that it tries to show the evils of ""anarchy"".

I was thinking while watching it, if I had an enemy rather than spend fortunes on security systems, I would go overseas on that day.

The acting was good. I  thought the two main actors Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey played well. There are times, I thought that Ethan Hawke acted the rising sales executive right on. Lena Headey probably not so much but as time went on in the film, her character got more interesting.

The filming was good, particularly when you consider they had only a small budget probably why there are no great special effects.",1422748800,,793,4.455172413793103

5592815,1,B00BEIYGT8,"I just want to preface this by saying one thing: To anyone on the fence who is considering buying this movie, I want you to know one thing: ANYONE who would give this movie a 5-star rating is working for the studio who is falsely trying to convince you that it's GREAT.

It's not great. It's not even good. It's barely even acceptable.

It scares the living daylights out of me that I live during a time whenever someone*anyone* would consider this a 5-star movie.

And it's not even a 1-star movie either but if there are going to be fake accounts jumping up the stars by rating it absurdly high, I'm going to rate it lower than it probably deserves, which is more like 2 stars.

The writing, the basic plot, the holes in the plot, the glaring inconsistencies, the horrible filming an cinematography all played a role in how horrible it was ultimately but it the bottom line is that the plot and the writing was just horrid. It had no business being made into a film and it's depressing to live in a culture where this movie gets green lighted and produced while so many other films don't. I'm actually a pretty big Ethan Hawke fan and the woman who played his wife was probably one of the better actresses  in the film but nothing was going to save this stinker. No way.

So in reality, if you believe ANYONE who says this is a 5-star movie, you deserve to buy it and get stuck with it. Citizen Kane is a 5-star film. Casablanca is a 5-star film. Streetcar Named Desire is a 5-star film.

This, at BEST, is a 2-star film. And I defy *anyone* to argue anything other (who isn't a shill for the studio or someone with an interest in how well this sells). It's awful. Awful. Just gawd-awful.",1421020800,2,1690,4.346031746031746

If a home is barricaded and one uses a battering ram or bazooka to break in, is that allowed or not allowed? Even if legal after 7 pm, isn't sharpening a machete or loading a weapon before 7 pm the inchoate offense of preparation to commit murder?  How about if you shoot someone at 6:59 am and he/she dies at or after 7 am, does that become illegal murder?  Who is responsible for cleaning up all the carnage and destruction after 7 am?

5593445,4,B00BEIYGT8,"I like movies that make you think about what if. What if the government let anarchy be free for one day. Going through it logicly, if are government did this what would really happen. Lets start at the beginning, the first purge. Gun sales would go through the roof weeks before the first purge. People would group up for common protection. Churches and other large groups would all band together and form large protection groups. Most people have guns in this country so there would be lots of armed people. The country would shut down weeks before the purge actually happened. Think of truck drivers and military personnel. Would any of them want to be working when there wife and kids might be raped and killed that night?

When the first purge happened it would be like a mass riot throughout the country. Do you think people would sit back and do nothing while people go around killing willy nil? No. The police and other people would form there own vigilant groups and kill on sight anyone doing anything immoral. Most people would stay home guarding there houses and most real criminals would too for the first purge. They would want to see if the government would stay true to there word and not prosecute anyone. Only the young thugs willing to riot would hit the streets and would be mowed down by off duty cops and there friends.

It would be weeks before normal services came back and people got back to work. We live in a just in time economy and food and gas would be scarce for weeks until things got back to normal. There would be a somewhat of a positive result from the first purge. All the crazy people that wanted to riot would probably be dead. Millions would have died that day but most people would have done the wait and see approce to it, stayed home and shot out the windows at anyone acting crazy.

The second purge would be bad. It would be like government ending, states splitting up bad. Most of the real crazies would have done the same thing as everyone else, stay inside and wait and see. If the government held to its word and didn't prosecute anyone for the crimes committed and 911 was off the hook the whole night. They then would have a year to prepare for the next night. During the second purge the country would burn to the ground. Its amazing how much destruction you can do with 10 gallons of gas and no fire department is going to show up. People would have had time to sup there cars up to mini tanks. Lots of fire bugs would have made lots of monolitof cocktails and made plans on how to create the most damage in the time they had. Most major city's would be burnt to the ground. The death toll would be in the tens of millions if not more. The vigilant groups would not be able to stop all the one to four person teams setting fire to everything.

After the second purge, the new founding fathers would all be hanged. Most city's would be smoking ruins. The fighting would never stop and most police would be shot on site for letting this happen. Are you going to pay your taxes when the guy who raped your wife and daughters to death lives down the street and winks at you? You're not going to wait another year for justice your going to kill him right now. And shoot the cops that get in your way. Most states would break away from the government and form independent governments. It would take 20 years to rebuild what in one night destroyed.",1413676800,,3393,4.398089171974522

It also has too much pretension and clich&eacute;s. Even more then Blair Witch 2.

5593705,1,B00BEIYGT8,"The Hollywood message of this movie is that white, rich people are really actually murderous racists.  I mean, really, why else would they use a black man as the main victim in the movie instead of another white person, particularly in a white neighborhood.  There's a clear message here, but most people will blindly miss it.  The truth about crime in this country is far different.  For those open minded enough to learn the truth, read on.  Truth is not racism...it is merely the truth.  And note that the government classifies Hispanics as a separate race (white, black, hispanic, asian, american indian)in nearly all their statistics except crime.  For crime data, they recently have eliminated the race category for hispanics, and instead add hispanic crime data to the rates of whites (white, black, asian, american indian). Now, why would they do that?

Comparison of UCR and NCVS data[edit]
According to the NCVS for 1992-2000, 43% of violent criminal acts, and 53% of serious violent crime (not verbal threats, or cuts and bruises) were reported to the police. Overall, black (49%) and American Indian (48%) victims reported most often, higher than whites (42%) and Asians (40%). Serious violent crime and aggravated assault against blacks (58% and 61%) and Indians (55% and 59%) was reported more often than against whites (51% and 54%) or Asians (50% and 51%). American Indians were unusually unlikely to report a robbery (45%), as with Asians and a simple assault (31%).[14]

Despite the differences in the amount of crime reported, comparisons of the UCR and NCVS data sets show there to be a high degree of correspondence between the two systems.[15] This correspondence extends to the racial demography of both perpetrators and victims of violent crime reported in both systems.[16]

Classification of Hispanics[edit]
The UCR classifies most Hispanics into the ""white"" category. The NCVS classifies some Hispanic criminals as ""white"" and some as ""other race"". The victim categories for the NCVS are more distinct.

Prison data[edit]
Further information: Incarceration in the United States and Statistics of incarcerated African-American males
According to the BJS non-Hispanic blacks accounted for 39.4% of the prison and jail population in 2009, with whites 34.2%, and Hispanics 20.6%. The incarceration rate of black males was over 6 times higher than that of white males, with a rate of 4,749 per 100,000 US residents.[17][18][19]

Hispanics constituted 16.3% of the US population according to the 2010 US census.[20][21] According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics the black incarceration rate in state and federal prisons declined to 3,161 per 100,000 and the white incarceration rate slightly increased to 487 per 100,000.[22] In 2009 American Indians and Alaskan Natives were jailed, paroled, or on probation at 932 per 100,000, 25% higher than for non-Indians/Natives (747), up 5.6% that year and 12% higher than 2007.[23] However, crime in general declined during this time down to near 1970 levels, an 18% decrease from the previous decade.[24]

A 2012 University of Michigan Law School study found that African Americans are given longer federal sentences even when factoring prior criminal records, and that African American jail sentences tend to be roughly 10% longer than white jail sentences for the same crimes.[25]

According to the US Census Bureau as of the year 2000 there were 2,224,181 blacks enrolled in college.[26] In that same year there were only 610,300 black inmates in prison according to the Bureau of Justice.[27] 12.5 percent have a bachelor's degree.[citation needed] The results are highly dependent on education. 30 percent of those without college education and nearly 60 percent of high school dropouts had prison records.[28]

Crime trends[edit]
Some studies had argued for smaller racial disparities in violent crime in recent times. However, a 2011 study which examined the racial disparities in violent crime and incarceration from 1980 and 2008 found little difference for black share of violent offending. Racial imbalances between arrest rates and sentencing have caused some to question the disparities. The authors argued that the prior studies had been confounded by not separating Hispanics from Whites. The number of Hispanic offenders has been increasing rapidly and have violence rates higher than that of Whites but lower than that of Blacks.[29] Another recent study in 2012 raises a different concern, showing that Hispanics and blacks receive considerably longer sentences for the same or lesser offenses on average than white offenders with equal or greater criminal records.[30][31]

Homicide[edit]
According to the US Department of Justice, blacks accounted for 52.5% of homicide offenders from 1980 to 2008, with whites 45.3% and Native Americans and Asians 2.2%. The offending rate for blacks was almost 8 times higher than whites, and the victim rate 6 times higher. Most murders were intraracial, with 84% of white homicide victims murdered by whites, and 93% of black victims murdered by blacks.[32][33]

Youth crime[edit]
The ""National Youth Gang Survey Analysis"" (2011) state that of gang members, 46% are Hispanic/Latino, 35% are African-American/black, 11.5% are white, and 7% are other race/ethnicity.[34]

According to the FBI Uniform Crime Reports, in the year 2008 black youths, who make up 16% of the youth population, accounted for 52% of juvenile violent crime arrests, including 58.5% of youth arrests for homicide and 67% for robbery. Black youths were overrepresented in all offense categories except DUI, liquor laws and drunkenness.[35]

Hispanics[edit]
According to a 2009 report by the Pew Hispanic Center, in 2007 Latinos ""accounted for 40% of all sentenced federal offenders-more than triple their share (13%) of the total U.S. adult population"". This was an increase from 24% in 1991. 72% of the Latino offenders were not U.S. citizens. For Hispanic offenders sentenced in federal courts, 48% were immigration offenses and 37% drug offenses. One reason for the large increase in immigration offenses is that they exclusively fall under federal jurisdiction.[36]",1410652800,,6496,5.4705294705294705

5593895,2,B00BEIYGT8,"It's really too bad that this movie is as preachy and politically correct as it is.  It had real potential.  Even given its shortcomings and idiocies there was still tension, at least early on.

In the near future, after a catastrophic economic breakdown, there's a new, prosperous America that now channels all aggression into an approved 12-hour period once yearly (just how it avoids violence the rest of the year is unsaid).  It's an absurd notion, but go with it because it's an interesting idea.  A rich family, the Sandins, have settled down for the night behind their mansions's steel-protected windows and doors.  Then the morons in the family come to the fore: the 12 or 13-year-old son, who should have been whipped to within an inch of his life, lets in a man who's begging for shelter.  He goes on to other fumblings.  The teenage daughter is a pouty jerk who acts solely as a complicating factor.  And the mother: what can we say about her?  Pistol-whipping would have been too merciful for her babbling and obnoxiousness.

Fair warning: there are spoilers ahead.  There's a gang after the man the boy let in.  Is it a bunch of street thugs after revenge on the rich folks?  Nope, it's a band of well-educated, well-off people off on a Purge Night lark.  Some of them are envious of the Sandins' wealth, so they're going to kill them.  Take that, you capitalist swine!  The refugee is black and homeless, so throw in a parable of wicked white overlords hunting down their proper minority prey.  There's a moment after the bad guys get into the house and have seemingly won, that they then encircle the family and chant some semi-religious mantra that is the logo of the New America.  So there, you religious cranks out there in non-movie America!

The father wants to turn the refugee over to the gang to save his family, but the rest of the family thinks the father's just a monster for even entertaining the idea.  Naturally the man on the run changes the father's heart and he decides to fight.  Now here's a real chestnut in the movie: he arms his son and tells him to hide (of course the idiot son hides in an obvious place with a flashlight on, so he's easily found); the mother looks at her husband and says ""You gave a pistol to our son!""  Well, duh.  You're all about to die, and you're upset about the pistol?  The movie just reeks of political correctness.

There are several very predictable deus ex machina moments, where a good guy pops up just in time to shoot the bad guy before he wreaks havoc on a family member.  Ho hum.

The capper is the bonus feature on the making of the film.  Filled with comments on the movie trying to make us think about rich and poor, guns and violence and the like, it reinforces the idea that the movie is as much an exercise in PC propaganda as it is entertainment.  Too bad.  The show had promise.",1409184000,,2860,4.505836575875486

Some people will be disappointed by the fact that this isn't about the purgers who are rampaging. That would have been a death wish type of film.

5594122,2,B00BEIYGT8,"This movie, like Sinister, had a really good premise.  Too bad about the outcome.  In fact, I think both movies should be called Sinister Purge.  They're both sinister in a bad way and you'll need to purge yourself after viewing both.  Why is it that Hawke seems to be attracted to projects that have an interesting concept, yet just don't deliver?

This movie takes on the interesting topic of reducing societal crime to one night a year in a ""new America"" so that it's legal for people to commit heinous acts on others they've been itching to do what most people would never do unless they were given that right.  Naturally, that's really not going to work in reality, because if people had to wait a whole year to feed on such awful desires, the suppression would make them explode long before that.  Okay, so we suspend reality, and in the film, you really HAVE to.

You can tell yourself you care about a bunch of rich snobs who can wall up safely behind closed door with a security system while they claim that this annual murder does so much good.  It's hard to swallow that pill when the less off are out there fighting for their self preservation.  Hawk's character is an unlikable jerk who is in the security system business, yet the crappy equipment he's designed doesn't appear to do jack for him and his family.  A family consisting of a frumpy looking, irritating wife (sort of like the shrew he was married to in Sinister, sans the fake, irritating British accent), a silly teenage daughter in a schoolgirl's uniform who you just want to slap because she's so annoying, and a boy who is the only one in the family who seems to have an ounce of compassion for the less off, yet plays with this ugly RC doll in a car incessantly to the point you want to blow the thing up, and has hair at a length that rivals his sister's.  The son in Sinister also had hair to has butt as well, but I guess it was so dark in both films they couldn't tell that either of them needed the Sampson and Delilah treatment.

Little junior lets a homeless guy (well, I guess he is) in off the street at the last minute before he's attacked, and provokes a group of arrogant weirdos, led by a greasy haired, snot-nosed punk (how old is this ""menace"" anyway, 16?) right up to their ""secured"" fortress which ironically has no gate around it.  They threaten to come in and kill the whole family if they don't give up the ""useless societal dredge"" within a certain amount of time, but it's hard to take seriously.  For one thing, nobody in the family is likeable, and for another, the morons out on the lawn with the masks on aren't very scary as they dance around and play on the swings.  Gee, I'm scared.  This is just like watching a bad episode of Gem and the Holograms.  It's truly, truly truly outrageous.

Lots of violence ensues, but there is a surprising twist toward the end--no, wait, it's only surprising if you weren't paying attention to some snide dialogue near the beginning.  Oh, it's so awful to be rich when other rich people buy your product without being forced to.  Sounds like typical Hollywood hypocrisy to me.  Hawkes' character ends up with the same fate as in Sinister, but I won't say so in case you haven't seen that one. Considering I thought Sinister was slightly better, all I can really say in conclusion is that they could have used Mr. Boogie as the adversary here again.  It would have been a whole lot more convincing.",1407801600,3,3440,4.460063897763578

Indeed, there are some very forced and contrived decisions by the characters to move the story along. But besides the silly decision-making and predictable ending, the film is otherwise a smart and well-made film, with quality acting and production.

Though a horror movie, this film does raise a lot of questions about freedom, human nature, wealth distribution and how the various classes in the US view each other.  None of the original cast members are in the sequel, but If the same cast from Purge 2 are in Purge 3, I'll go see it and I'm a 60-year old white guy, which is definitely not the target audience.

5594752,3,B00BEIYGT8,"THE PURGE (2012) poses an interesting, wild premise: What if, for a 12-hour period, one had the freedom to commit ANY crime?! That is the story in this unique, provocative, yet flawed film. This movie has gotten a lot of negative reviews, but I'm somewhere in the middle. While it has a few annoyances and frustrating moments, it does a good job of showing who your REAL friends are in this world and when the chips are down, who you perhaps can really count on. The ""kindness of strangers"" takes on a whole new meaning in this one!

Set in the supposedly not-too-distant future, Hawke persuasively plays James Sandin, a rich suburbanite whose company sells ""foolproof"" home security systems designed to protect ""the haves"" against intruders during the annual purge, where the government allows anarchy to prevail for a period of 12 hours. Rampant crime is allowed and no one will be prosecuted as long as they commit their lawless acts within the acceptable timeframe. Sandin and his wife Mary (superbly played by Lena Headey), along with their 2 kids Charlie (Max Burkholder) and Zoey (Adelaide Kane) stay barricaded in their high-tech home, protected by the security system. But things go awry as Charlie spots a bloodied ""Stranger"" (excellently played by Edwin Hodge) running for his life, and activate the system to let him in. There is another major development (which kind of took me out of the movie for a while) that coincides with this. Then the group of psychotic purgers arrive to bargain with the Sandins to turn over the Stranger.

There are several weak points of the film, most notably the actors playing the Sandin kids. I get that child actors should be allowed some leeway, but they were important to the plot. Also, these 2 characters did extremely frustrating things that caused all the trouble to begin with! Also, that early major development that coincides with the Stranger's arrival was one of the most convoluted things I've ever seen in a movie! I thought it was a cheap way for the director to get across the message, when the latter stages of the film did a more potent job of doing so. Finally, I thought the main purger tormenting the family wasn't very intimidating. A very standard stone-faced, monotone-speaking ""movie psycho"" character.

Strong performances by Hawke, Headey, and Hodge help keep the film afloat, though. And the ending of the movie kind of helps save it to some degree, as it is very powerful and surprisingly non-cliche. Recommended with some caution!",1405728000,,2505,4.889411764705883

How should killing others help to satisfy our frustrations in life once a year.  Wouldn't that just build up anxieties throughout the year that create other problems within ourselves?

We would have a world of savages on all levels.  Almost primitive in nature.  Some may even think this would be a dream come true.  Can you imagine how people would be so afraid of what they may have done to some through the year, until that one night comes.  Afraid they may be killed, robbed, raped, or etc. on that one legalized night of terror.  Imagine all the filled hospitals, Dr. offices, and other health facilities for emotional, and illnesses caused by the stress of worrying about the horror filled night to come.

This movie is just that, a movie.  Mankind can be evil, but showing one in this light is a bit much.  They even made a sequel.  I guess some like to let their imagination roll.",1405555200,,1062,4.458333333333333

5594876,3,B00BEIYGT8,"In general, I hate movies that force the audience to completely suspend disbelief.  Naturally, this film would fall into that category.

There's no way that this scenario would ever happen, and so that is its biggest problem.  But I still decided to give it a try, mostly because it was on ""free"" TV, but more so because I'm a fan of Ethan Hawke.  In particular, I was a big fan of his work -- and the film itself -- in ""Gattaca,"" one of the best sci-fi films ever made.  That film was surprisingly believable, as it is quite possible that people in the future will be discriminated against due to genetics.  (It's probably happening already, what with sites like 23andMe.)  And I really liked ""Sinister,"" a quite underrated horror film that really gives the audience the chills, even though the plot isn't exactly believable either.

And I really hated it here how they overly moralized, what with the homeless black guy that the young-and-stupid-ultra-liberal son lets in.  Yikes.  Without giving too much away, I actually liked Mr. Hawkes original position, how he felt -- rightfully so -- that it was his job to protect his family at all costs; but then he later changes that position to probably appease a stupid American viewing audience.  I suppose the film makers wanted him to be a sympathetic character, and that's just a fail in this case.

It is interesting to think about certain concepts:  NIMBY being one, since the protagonists originally didn't care about murders, as long as those murders happened outside the 'burbs.  And the idea that, if there weren't any laws, then there wouldn't be any crime.  (Yes, you don't have to think too long to realize that this is correct.  Ironically, laws create crime and criminals.)  But the film isn't strong enough to overcome its original weaknesses in believability.

I'll go with a minor pass on this today, even though it's probably better than it should have been.",1405036800,2,1925,4.7993920972644375

5594964,1,B00BEIYGT8,"The basic premise of this film is that one day every year America is immersed in what is known as ""The Purge,"" in the fashion of a holiday. For 12 hours on this day (7PM stretching into the next morning at 7AM), you may commit any crime on the books... but also have said crimes perpetrated on you. For this stretch, there are no police or ambulatory services. A reference to the ""New Founding Fathers"" is alluded to when this commences in the film. Clearly, there has been some ""change"" in government.

Ethan Hawke is a super-successful home security salesman who has sold an effective system to all of his neighbors. Their envy for Hawke's wealth is displayed in a ridiculously-obvious manner by writer/director James DeMonaco. I'm not sure if DeMonaco intended this, but when the main characters are poorly written and generally unlikable, how is the viewer supposed to feel any suspense when said characters are at a knife point? Lena Heady plays Hawke's wife and her blithe ""The purge does a lot of good"" attitude is a terrific example of this. The son is a ghoul who ends up irreversibly dooming the once-secure home for the plot climax and the daughter is a stereotype of angsty teens who ""like, TOTALLY like, hates, like everything."" The unimaginative, formulaic build-up was bad enough -- then The Purge happens.

No spoilers here, but trust me, you'll want to see this for absolutely free. Anyway, I found the snooty undertones of this ""film"" to be about as nauseating as Tinseltown's typically-hollow, preachy crap. The film begins with a picture of America 20 years in the future: crime and unemployment are both at an all-time low. However, the 12-hour ""purge"" is soooooo necessary because people generally have no impulse control and they damn-well need this 12 hour period to settle scores and whack any and all enemies. Anyone else see that this was written by some closet sociopath who actually thinks that anyone with an income under $5 mill will kill at will IF given dispensation to do so?

DeMonaco even goes as far as to feature some ""professional"" on the tele spouting-off about how violent society is with wars. Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't the political scum the ones to perpetrate wars and then urge working class people to send their kids to fight said war? ""The Purge"" would have been far more true to human nature if it were applied to the elite corporate psychopaths (especially in hollywood) who would carve their rivals for even a slight bonus in money and/or fame.",1404777600,4,2504,4.778290993071593

Duh.  Why, an annual day of legalized mass bloodletting, of course!  Oh, no you di'un't!  Oh, yes, we did!) I envision their original financing proposal involving box tops, chain letters and hamster-nappings-for-ransom, were so committed to their Burgessian vision of America's looming moral and socioeconomic demise they chose to double down on the implausibility factor of their dystopian masterwork by setting it a mere (then) nine years in the future.

As often happens I completely forgot about this movie until just today when I saw a preview for The Purge 2: Anarchy. I am pleased to say that this movie did deliver. I thought that The Purge was a suspenseful film with unexpected twists (and I almost always expect them.) The film was well written, and well acted.

-1 star, the one thing that detracted from my overall happiness with The Purge, is the setting. They have taken this amazing new, interesting story and locked it up inside a Panic Room meets Funny Games. Instead of exposing us to the widespread chaos that those 12 hours must bring, we instead are given little more than a home invasion movie. This entire movie could have better served as the backstory for someone setting out to stop, or participate in the next purge. In that, the movie was a disappointment.

Having the advantage of knowing that the sequel will be providing us a larger look at the event, I was able to look past the micro focus, and enjoy the movie.",1400371200,,1181,4.566037735849057
5595119,3,B00BEIYGT8,"I remember when the trailer to THE PURGE first came out and the premise was laid out, my good friend Bollywood Bob blurted out: ""You mean I could jaywalk all night long and I WON'T GET A TICKET?!"" Yes, Bollywood Bob, that's exactly right. During the Purge, you can jaywalk with immunity.

In the year 2022 it's good to be a merchant of home security systems. In 2022 America is experiencing a remarkable era of peace and prosperity. Unemployment stands at 1%. Crime is at an unprecedented low. There's barely a whiff of Violence... except on one scheduled night, when the hooligans and the freaks and the mass murderers come out like sharks circling the water.

March 21, 2022, and sucks for you if you lose track of time. When it strikes 7 o'clock in the evening, you had best be hunkered down in a safe place. Or you'd best be packin'. In this near future, the United States' new founding fathers have instituted the Purge, an annual twelve-hour period in which any crime is legal (and encouraged) and all emergency services are suspended. The working theory is that this state of anarchy serves as a psychological release valve. It's the one night that allows the populace to unleash its pent-up aggression. The movie's premise begs incredulity, but you can't deny its intrigue. And, yeah, it's a fairly novel concept. Note that a STAR TREK episode - ""Return of the Archons"" - did it first and four decades ago.

3 out of 5 stars for THE PURGE, a film that is half social allegory, half home-invasion thriller. With its nifty hook and its (mostly) good cast, it should've been better than it was. Instead, there are any number of superior home invasion thrillers out there (THE STRANGERS, FUNNY GAMES, PANIC ROOM, WAIT UNTIL DARK). Mostly, THE PURGE is sabotaged by weak execution and by director James DeMonaco's pulling his punches. The result is a tour de blah down the clich factory. Lots of fumbling in the dark. Some anemic scares. Sorry, hopeful gorehound.

On the good side, the social satire comes across as sharply here as it does in, say, THE HUNGER GAMES. It's a premise that provokes thought and triggers some interesting discussions. I like that Ethan Hawke's character, James Sandin, who hawks home security systems, comes off as vaguely scumbaggish. Sandin is a man of his time. As such, he reacts with ingrained apathy and with reflex rationalization towards the atrocities committed during the Purge. It's been drummed into him that the Purge is good for the country. It unburdens the economy, never mind that it achieves this by eradicating the poor, the needy, the defenseless, and whoever else that doesn't contribute to society. His wife Mary (Lena Headey) is equally indifferent. It's hard to rage against something that's made you so rich. James Sandin, who is good at his job, has sold his security system to practically everyone in his affluent, gated community. He decorates his home with blue flowers as a show of support for the Purge. Leave it to their kids to conjure up the elephant in the room - Are they doing the right thing? To which one parent remarks: ""Just remember all the good the Purge does, okay? That's all that matters.""

Me, I have trouble getting behind horror flicks in which the protagonists usher in their own doom, so there's that. I don't think I'm spoilering things when I say that, yeah, the intruders breach the Sandin household. But did you - as I did - yell at the kid when he did what he did? And did you then check yourself? Because what the kid did was stupid, yes, but he did it from a goodhearted place.

Can this family under siege survive the night without forfeiting their humanity? More importantly, can you stomach this family? Will you find them likable enough to have a rooting interest? Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey deliver steady performances. It doesn't mean their characters are ones that you'd invite over. Or do you chafe under the collar because they're direct reflections of yourself if presented with the same harrowing choices? And I have to say it: The children are super annoying. The eccentric son, Charlie (Max Burkholder), is tapped as the one who asks the hard questions, so there's something to that. But, otherwise, he's such a damp, poorly etched character. The other kid, Zoey (Adelaide Kane), wastes copious screen time either being mopey or stupidly running away or in a state of catatonia. Turns out, the most likable person is the homeless guy (Edwin Hodge). The most interesting person would have to be Rhys Wakefield's creepy but very polite leader of a group of entitled psychopaths.

Quick aside: Doesn't the boy's tricked-out, remote controlled toy tank with the ruined baby doll on top cry out ""Hey, contrived plot device over here!"" to you?

A SPOILERS alert for this paragraph: For all the good acting work Ethan Hawke puts in, my favorite moment is the pool room scene in which he lets loose and unleashes his inner Straw Dog on a bunch of masked intruders. It's probably the film's highlight action sequence. Hawke does one thing here that is really gratifying. He puts down the intruders and then administers the finishing shots. How often does the good guy not finish off his opponent only to have the creep come back as a last-minute scare?

THE PURGE raked in around $89 million on a $3 million budget. So of course there'll be a sequel and it's almost here. But will it dive as deeply into morality plays and class divides? Me, I'd be cool with a prequel in which we learn more about those game-changing founding fathers and we see what went down during the inaugural Purge.

Just the other day my good friend Bollywood Bob crashed over at my place, and I heard him muttering in his sleep, something about the Purge and the need to ""violate, annihilate, and cleanse our souls."" I need to scrounge around for some blue flowers. Or a machete.

5595219,3,B00BEIYGT8,"Just some thoughts about it in general and trying to avoid major spoilers.

Not a bad movie. But way to many logic gaps.

The daughter is a typical teen spoiled, good looking, mean girl type. Felt no sympathy for her problems.

The family? Rich fools who despite the father being a security salesman, did a bad job securing his place. As a security guy he should have the best precautions and he does not.

Power lines easy to cut by the bad guys from the outside? I mean really?
Security cameras outside but none inside and they live in a huge mansion like home?

Knowing the purge is happening. Yet puts the home shields down minutes before? Why not hours earlier in case it jams?

Know there is a purge yet have no hidden shelters or secret bunkers inside? For a second and third layer of security?

Tells the kid to hide in the basement? That has no secret compartment and no real place to hide.

Yet the kid has a secret very small room that even the sister knows about. And the only smart one to have a room.

Sister hides under a bed? Knowing the brother got a much more secret room and it's a better option.

It also sets a bad undertone message in that the family who is wealthy. The guy sold security equipment and earned his money. there is no hint of drug use, theft, or him being a bad or evil businessman. What he did was legit.

Yet the people who bought his equipment feel anger, that he made a lot of money off them. And now they want revenge.

And there is no hint that the equipment is bad. It was of good quality.

So basically this tells society. If you make a business legally, ethically and get rich. Just by the very nature of you being rich and well off. You are somehow evil. And that others should have a right to come after you and get revenge.

Overall an entertaining if flawed movie.

And the biggest flaw being he's a security salesman, and yet doesn't even have a hidden bunker in his own home as backup.",1398816000,17,1937,4.2684931506849315
5595220,3,B00BEIYGT8,"In 2022, just 8 years from now, the U.S. government has instituted a new holiday. One that has led to peace and prosperity, but at an extreme cost to the less fortunate. For 12 hours, once a year, all crime is legal and people are given the opportunity to release their hatred and rage on anyone they can find. The cast isn't important to a film like this, it's all about the writers cynical message, that behind every smile is jealousy, behind every hand shake is anger, and trust has become a luxury that no one can afford. This Purge is all about the message that is being portrayed, but it has some major holes in the story. If all crime is legal for 12 hours, how come the only thing on peoples mind is murder? There weren't any rapes or bank robberies, nor where there any acts of terrorism or lashing out at authority. It was all about the killing. Most of the Purge is fairly predictable and it is what you would expect it to be. The big surprise comes at the end, which was extremely powerful, and really gives people the opportunity to question the message the writers have portrayed throughout the film. The only notable performance is that of the stars, Ethan Hawke, who was terrific, in a role I really didn't see him fitting into.

5595284,5,B00BEIYGT8,"I do!  I believing in doing good things!  Good things that help people!  The Purge shows viewers the impossible law passing that allows 12 straight hours of committing crimes exactly one day out of the year.  It's legal!  Now at first I wasn't sure what kind of crimes the movie was going for.  I figured it meant petty things such as robbing a cashier man at the downtown convenience store or stealing food in a grocery store.  No!  This is a supposed law being passed that allows murder and rape!  What, really?  COME ON!

Now of course, you can imagine due to the many low ratings here on amazon, many people dislike the concept and question its basis on reality.  No, it's not realistic at all.  I personally think the biggest crime this movie committed is calling itself a horror movie.  It's not really horror in the sense that ghosts and aliens torture people out of their homes.  That doesn't happen.  It's definitely more suspenseful than anything.

Let me mention the flaws, of which there's many (and you probably knew I was going to mention them since it's unavoidable not to notice, hehe).

- Why did it seem like hours before the scheduled purging got underway, the rich suburban neighborhood didn't seem to feel nervous in any way?  Regardless how well protected you are with firearms and regardless how modern and sturdy your installed security system is, wouldn't you at least be *somewhat* nervous?  Wouldn't you show at least a little concern?  We're talking about the strong possibility of death here or at the very least property destruction of some kind, and the family the movie in this movie has a younger son and a teenage daughter.  Isn't it human nature to be scared to death and DREAD this day?  Wouldn't you want to be extra cautious with your kids?  But... these parents didn't seem to care.  It's apparently just another walk down the sidewalk with Beaver and Wally in this neighborhood.

- Let's say those willing to commit murder give in to their sadistic ways since they have a 12-hour window to do so.  Without releasing spoilers, what would stop a man from killing someone a few minutes after the 12 hours are up?  Especially if you go through the kind of torment this family does and murder almost seems necessary to survive.  It's not like the FBI and cops would be able to notice that you committed a crime by only a few minutes after the times up!  Then again if such a law is passed that allows murder, the cops and FBI are probably not too concerned about the day after anyway since it's too much law-breaking to handle at once.

- Why did the family NOT stay in their protected firearm-loaded room the entire time the purge was occurring?  The daughter gets up and leaves because hanging out with her parents is apparently lame... and the son does too... and the parents do nothing to stop them!  I'd be like ""Where do you think you two are going?  Get back here and sit with your mother and me for 12 hours while we wait and watch the camera filming the outside front yard!""  Hey, they could even make it a family night.  It's not like America has any of those anymore anyway.  :)

With all that said, as a movie -a suspense- I'm willing to overlook the obvious flaws and the silly premise and just enjoy it.  While it does bring up a noticeable but never directly stated point that moral issues seem to be tossed aside these days just for the purpose of passing another law, I'd like to think America would *never* go down the path of allowing murders to happen one day out of the year for 12 hours.  This would be the worst possible thing ever, and anybody with a conscience should immediately realize how ridiculous this would be if true.

The fictional storyline itself is just outrageous with MANY twists and turns.  In fact I'm only going to reveal one part, and that's when the younger son is watching the camera footage of his front yard on a TV in his backroom showing a man running, screaming and begging for someone to open the doors and let him inside.  He's begging for his life because a gang of highly unusual murder-happy young adults wearing masks and carrying guns are determined to take advantage of the purging (and basically worship this day) so they are going around targeting homeless people, which this man happens to be.

The boy (played by Max Burkholder from the awesome drama Parenthood) lets him inside believing the man's really running for his life... and right after this all sorts of chaos ensues when the gang realizes the family is hiding the homeless man inside their tightly locked home, BUT... I consider none of the events that take place from here on out predictable for storyline purposes.  At least two MAJOR twists happen, maybe even three.  People you think are the bad guys suddenly turn good in the heat of the moment and vice versa, and the deaths themselves happen to be incredibly graphic.  The mother reluctantly holding a firearm as she roams the dark hallways assuming that nothing would go wrong is a good moment (or perhaps this is all unintentional and she's actually acting poorly in her role- ha, I hope not- would make me look like a big fool for complimenting her!)

The story mostly focuses on the father wanting to protect his family from the gang of misfits that hang around their front yard and threaten to break into their home with back-up vehicles capable of destroying the security around the family's front door if they don't release the homeless man to them (who's now hiding somewhere in this dark, overlarge house and nobody knows where he is).  Here's the real kicker- the main guy from the gang happens to be exceptionally screwy in the head because to prove how serious he is about potentially murdering the family, he turns his gun to the man next to him who he claims is his best friend, and shoots/kills him.  Wow, even if the family WERE able to find and hand over the homeless man, would you seriously be willing to open the front door and take a chance that you won't eat a bullet for your troubles?  I certainly wouldn't trust the guy from that gang.  He just killed his friend!  He proved he's no more than a crazy lunatic himself.

This movie is really crazy.  Thankfully we can all sleep easy knowing that such an annual purging ordeal would never really happen... right?  *waves tiny American flag and nervously sings God Bless America more convincingly than ever before* :)

I know if I was in this situation I'd create a sturdy, well-protected backroom containing a variety of guns, much like the ones the family has in this movie that they mostly neglected to use, and I'd stay there wide awake the whole night shaking and waiting for anything unusual to come through that door... and then I'd react accordingly.  I'd only shoot if I felt my life was in danger.  Hopefully that's what most people would do because actually taking advantage of such a crime-filled night by going through with the committing of them should make you feel really bad and empty inside.  You're now soulless!

I can't help but think there's many different ways to create a storyline out of a 12-hour crime spree.  Instead of creating a suburban rich family hiding and protecting themselves, they could have shown people with less money and resources scared for their lives in the main part of a city, and we could watch THEIR situations develop.  Or perhaps somewhere out in the country such as a farm in Kansas.  Or maybe Florida near Key West.  Or how about the snowy mountains of Alaska?  So many possibilities.

At least the movie does several things right.  It's quality entertainment for one thing, and it's a storyline I've never encountered in a movie before so I feel it's somewhat original.  The parents -despite not feeling as much concern as they should concerning the safety of their children and their own safety thanks to the apparent confident belief that they're safe and sound in their suburban rich home- are good enough actors/actresses.  At least they're willing to die for their kids.  It's Max's character I like the most.  Him and his little remote control car with a red-eyed camera hidden inside turns out to be such a nifty, case-cracking tool!

The ending has its problems though.  I mean now that it's all out in the open (*ahem!* I'm not spoiling what it is!) why take a chance and let it... fade away like nothing happened?  And return to normal after all that?  You can't.  You'd now be watching your back all day/everyday.  You have to finish it.  Finish it by packing your things, leaving and never coming back again.",1397260800,,8560,4.620941020543406

5595288,3,B00BEIYGT8,"I rarely review movies because I think that people lose focus of the fact that it is just a movie when they review something.  Furthermore a movie is meant to entertain and there for if you were able to finish a movie it has done its job in holding your attention and entertaining you.

So, yes, I finished the movie, it held my attention but I must admit toward the end I started to clean so I would not say it did a great job.  I agree with most people in that the makers of this movie missed an opportunity to showcase a wider scope of the event (the purge).  However the narrow scope shown in the movie did provide enough insight into societal actions and reactions during the purge to satisfy a views interest.

Now I will break my rule about treating the movie as a movie.  Its premise is kind of stupid.  The Purge has resulted in the decrease in crime and a growth in the economy (so the movie states) however, I would imagine, the cost to the taxpayers to rebuild after all the mayhem would be pretty significant and similar to what would be spend annually in law enforcement, fire, rescue, and ambulatory services, and rebuilding/clean up.  So, because I was not thoroughly entertained, I am going to take a logical shot at a made up story mainly because the story did make me think, which I guess is good.

However this movie was ridiculous in too many ways too count.

The movie dragged on and on until the climax which was more like a wet drip then a big bang.

I found the concept of the movie interesting but the execution itself was executed horribly.

Interesting and disturbing concept on paper but making a film with that concept in mind was a very bad idea in the end.

The acting overall wasn't bad it was the concept and the way in which it was executed that was the epitomy of BAD .

Not too mention though the movie may have had some suspense it never lasted long because the movie went by like a flash of lightning.

The moment something seemed like it was gonna get interesting it was over and moved on to something else in the film.

In a horror film also most of the time you want too root for someone too survive you always find that person or persons that you like and root for too make it through the end.

In this film however...that was hard too do considering the family the movie revolves around were all for the violence in the beginning and then grew a conscience near the end .

This was ridiculous too say the least.

There are some moments when the suspense is to the MAXIMUM (hehe not really), but this would be classified as a M. Night S. Movie, just for its ""thriller"" and suspenseful moments. This is still a great movie but most HARD CORE CRITICS or dropping it to the level of poopyness that no one wants to go there. It's underrated and it's really fun with friends, so I recommend it, just don't have high hopes for it, it's a unique idea that I haven't heard from any other movie, and it works, it's suspenseful and disturbing at sometimes seeing the family crumble as the movie progresses.",1396224000,,922,4.461538461538462

5595358,3,B00BEIYGT8,"This movie is based on a lot of stupidity that takes you out of the movie and makes suspension of disbelief pretty hard.  Furthermore, the characters and populace at large act pretty stupidly.  But, I must say, I loved the action within the house.  There are quite a few shotgun blasts that will have you flashing devil horns or waving a fist.

The biggest issues:

1) One day a year everyone can indulge in murderous, monstrous rage.  That nearly stops violence in America.  LOL.  Yeah, so the drug wars stopped, the gang wars stopped, domestic abuse stopped, rapists and serial killers and mass murderers all respect the Purge?  The movie says that while not all crime stopped, it has been reduced incredibly because all of these losers of our species respect and love the Purge.  What a load of crap.  So there's my first problem with the film.  Very hard to believe.

2) We have new ""Founders.""  Who are they?  Why are they?  When were they accepted?  Why?  No idea.  The movie does not explain how a nation of gun-toting, freedom-loving people accept overlords.  So there's another problem.

3) The father sells security systems that are supposed to stand up to a night murderous rage . . . really?  Anything allowed.  No cops, no fire dept., no ambulances, etc. are operating for 12 hours.  People can ram trucks into houses, build IED's, set fire to homes, gas a family through their HVAC system, and so on.  So not only is a security system of steel walls stupid.  The father does not arm his family.  He does not train his family in gun-handling.  And he has no control over his teen daughter who almost kills the family.  Oh, and his son who also almost kills the family.

Needless to say, the movie is frustrating.  It does not think through the concept it proposes.  A night of absolute terror and violence looms EVERY YEAR, sanctioned by the government.  Nobody bands together?  Nobody trains?  Nobody stockpiles weapons?  The family does not even have a dog, for god's sake!  On top of that, murderous neighbors show their faces?  If I survive your attack, I am going to kill you next year, dopey!  In this new world, medieval tactics would come into play again: siege weapons, moats, sapping, etc.  It would be the only way to survive.  Nobody in THE RICHEST OF NEIGHBORHOODS tries anything but a . . . security system?  Cameras and walls that require . . . wait for it . . . electricity that can be CUT.  (And is, by the way)

So, NEVER BUY THIS.  It is worth watching only for the action, which is thrilling at times.  Also, the young guy who portrays the leader of a yuppie band of murderers is EXCELLENT.  Very creepy.  Great actor.  Better than all of the experienced cast in this movie.  So, you might want to check his performance out.",1395187200,3,2757,4.560574948665297

But tell me people will limit their criminal activities to one night a year and Im throwing a penalty.  That is the ridiculous premise of The Purge which is a simply and unapologetically a violent home invasion film trying to disguise itself as a treatise on social morals and class warfare.

Its the year 2022 and the United States has recovered from a near total social and economic collapse.  Unemployment and crime has been almost completely eliminated thanks to The Purge a yearly event in which all crime is legal for one night.  Well, crime is a bit of a misnomerWe don't see people breaking into banks, holding up liquor stores, or writing bogus checks.  Seems the only crime left in the country in 2022 is murder, and that we plenty of!

Ethan Hawke is James Sandin, a wealthy sales executive of state-of-the-art home security systems and lives in a swanky, upper class suburb.  With his All-American family consisting of wife Mary (Lena Heady) and two kids, they enjoy a nice dinner before settling down for the nights chaos as if they were gathering around the TV to watch The Brady Bunch.  Only something goes wrong with their plans.  Teenage son Charlie who has more compassion than brains, lifts the security doors to let in a wounded man who is being chased by a mob.  The mob led by their Polite Leader shows up at their door demanding that they turn the man over to them or they will huff and puff and blow their doors downand kill everyone in the house.  Now James and his family have to arm themselves against the onslaught of the mob and try to survive the night.

Its hard to put into words just how stupid of a film this isit borrows (read steals) from films like Fort Apache: The Bronx, The Strangers, and Funny Games, all of which were vastly superior.  In fact Rhys Wakefields performance as the mobs leader channels  Michael Pitts role from funny Games so much that he should have turned over his salary.

The Purge does little to further its class warfare premise and even tosses it out the window completely as one group of rich bastards decides to turn on another group of rich bastards and wastes our time in the process.",1391299200,3,2270,4.567901234567901

So you think you know what it's about from the trailers, and you do...kind of. But the story is far more intricate and full of twists then you would guess. I found the far-more-intricate-then-imagined plot highly entertaining. While there are plot holes in the general idea, I found the movie engrossing enough to overlook them. It wasn't action-packed all the way, but it moved at a good clip and held my interest. It was also very well cast, especially the 'polite leader' of the Purgers. He's enough to give you nightmares all by himself.

All is right in the world, I'm enjoying the movie immensely, and then...then, it all gets ruined. I won't spoil it, but let's just say that absolutely undeserved mercy is given, for no reason you can sink your teeth into, and it really ruined it for me.

5595879,1,B00BEIYGT8,"When I first saw commercials for THE PURGE, it looked like every other home-invasion survival horror film that's been produced over the last several years; gleeful homicidal maniacs wearing creepy masks break into the home of a wealthy white-bread family, and the family has to fight them off. And with Ethan Hawke, one of the more overrated actors currently working, as the star, it had even less attractive qualities to me. But after reading about the concept behind the film, I decided to give writer/director James DeMonaco's film a try, because from a high-concept standpoint, THE PURGE sounded quite exciting.

Well, the concept is still exciting, but the film doesn't get beyond the lowest-common-denominator garbage that it always looked like.

In the United States of the not-too-distant future, poverty and crime are at all-time lows thanks to a group known as The New Founding Fathers (which we never see or hear about in specifics) who are now running the country. To offset the crippling economy and extreme criminality that had plagued the country just prior to the Fathers coming into power, they institute ""The Purge"", a 12-hour period of time where all crime, especially violent crime, is not only legal, but encouraged. At the heart of this film is the Sandin family (Hawke and Lena Headey as the parents, Adelaide Kane and Max Burkholder as the kids). James (Hawke) is a salesman of home security systems, and thanks to the Purge, he's become very successful. Mary (Headey) seems to be a stay-at-home mom, Zoey (Kane) is the mid-teen daughter seeing the older boy her father forbids her to see, and Charlie (Burkholder) is the tween son with a brain, playing with his remote-controlled tank/creepy doll-head. It's the day of the Purge, and they lock down their home for the night, but a homeless man (Edwin Hodge) outside is allowed in the home by the naive Charlie, and a pack of young preppy killers led by Rhys Wakefield (whose character credit is Polite Leader) demand that the Sandins release the ""filthy homeless man"" to their murderous urges, or they will smash down the barricades their house has and kill everyone. Morality and the protective urges are at conflict, but as you can predict, the preppies with their creepy masks and sing-song lunacy enter and the Sandins have to make a stand.

Never mind that the second and third acts of the film play out almost exactly as you would think they would, aside from a moronic and telegraphed 11th-hour ""twist"". Never mind that everything that DeMonaco does with this film, from a visual standpoint, is totally uninspired and uninteresting. Never mind that the performances in the film are of the check-cashing variety, and that the members of the Sandin family are, naturally, morons in this situation. And never mind that James Sandin is a totally moral vacuum of a protagonist; how are we supposed to root for a man whose livelihood has been considerably improved by this event? If that was all the film was going to be, then it could have literally been recycled from dozens if not hundreds of the same type of film over the past several years. What really annoys me is the utter waste of a really powerful social, political and economic commentary that this film all but squanders by focusing on just this one incident with these specific people. If DeMonaco, who also wrote the abysmal remake of John Carpenter's ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 as well as the totally unwatchable werewolf horror-romance, SKINWALKERS, decided to focus more on building a world that these characters inhabit rather than just going to the cheap adrenaline rush of the home-invasion thriller, he might have had something really special. For instance, poverty and homelessness are potentially at such a low rate because it's the homeless and poor people that are being murdered on the night of The Purge. Where are the objectors to this idea? There can be no level of economic calamity and criminal brutality that would be so hopeless that everyone across America believes that The Purge is the solution. Who are the New Founding Fathers? What is their agenda? Is America a totalitarian state now? None of these ideas are explored in this film, other than the question of the homeless people, which is given nothing more than a perfunctory explanation.

So, bad performances, bad script, bad direction all surrounded by a great idea makes THE PURGE an even more painful viewing experience. There's a very interesting film trapped somewhere in THE PURGE, but it's unlikely we'll ever see it.",1390176000,6,4540,4.93848167539267

It starts out fantastic and then 20 minutes in you begin to see the shallow nature.. then by the end you just have your head in your hands going 'why, why, why would you go this direction!?'

I'm sure most of you know the plot.. one night a year, American's get to completely purge their souls of evil by going on a criminal binge. All things are legal, chaos erupts in the streets, no police, no firemen, no hospitals, all of the systems put in place to protect you on a daily basis are gone. And anyone and everyone who wants to take a shot at you has an opportunity to do so - and there isn't a damn thing you can do about it except fight back.

So, with a very horrifying concept in hand, what do we get? We get to see a bunch of rich people fight other rich people inside a house. Yea. A massive, nation-wide concept of horror and chaos... we get to experience it condensed into one house. One family. A wealthy family, who can afford protection, who would have undergone ZERO risk except for their own ignorance, find themselves embroiled in a Keeping up with the Jones' style mess. Basically we get an overly dramatic version of Panic Room... Panic Room may have been better.

Now, I know some of your artsy types are going to talk about the expression of morals, or the juxtaposition of classes or the ironic motif etc. Blah, blah. Who cares. The point is this. It was an absolutely fantastic concept, truly one I looked forward to seeing. It was marketed correctly, the opening scenes set it up correctly, and then someone suffered brain damage and ruined the rest.

I only gave two stars for the idea behind the movie, but I assure you there is very little worth seeing here. If you are a scary movie buff, I'd say watch it just so you can use it as an example as what not to do with a film.",1389225600,3,2039,4.31331592689295

If you're that rich I am sure you could make a fairly decent fallout shelter in the basement or something. Not just steel doors over windows and entryways.

But I like the thought in this movie. The direction it was leading to. The ending sucked. Though and the family was hard to get emotionally connected to. And I found the mother to be just as annoying as the lady trying to kill her. I hope they make a Purge number two and put more effort into it.

and if it was real (thank God its not)  then all the people that went along with it should also die! because they are part of the nasty evil that it is!  so again, the world would end--- ummmmm

5596378,3,B00BEIYGT8,"I was excited to see this movie as I love thriller types like this. For the first half of the movie I genuinely enjoyed it. Maybe 4 star liked it. The idea of a Purge day and the process behind it was a twisted idea, but had great potential for movie of this sorts with many ""What would you do?"" type scenarios. But as the film continued on, it started to lose its thrill. The reasons being:

- I couldn't understand the Son's thoughts...during the purge or life in general. He comes off as not understanding the horror/reason behind the purge - which is understandable. Heck, the adults were a little foggy on the concept. But we are left hanging as to whether or not he agrees/disagrees by the end - even though some of the movies major events circled around him. Maybe some people don't care about what he thinks. But seeing how he was the reason the stranger got in the house, he's the reason the stranger was protected, and he's the reason all hell broke loose at their house... I kinda think his ""motive"" is important!

- What the hell happened to the stranger?!?! So in the beginning he is let in the house. Then through 75% of the movie he's in hiding. Okay. Cool, I guess. Whatever. Then out of nowhere at the end he just pops up and is like ""Heeeeey - saved your life!"" and becomes the hero. Seriously?

- What the hell happened to the daughter?!?! Same thing as the stranger, she starts off as a major part in the movie. After her boyfriend goes batshit she just disappears somewhere in the house. Never to be seen until the end again.

- Last but certainly not least, was the mother's ""hysterics"" acting. It drove me nuts. Who looks for a killer(s) in their house with their eyeballs plastered on the ground while holding a gun ready for a shoot out. The entire time she's scared and hunting for killers in her house she is seriously staring at the floor, crying, carrying a gun. Meanwhile killers 1-6 are right in front of her - literally 2 feet away - and she doesn't see them because she's staring at the floor!! Common sense, people!

Anyways, that's what I thought. It was entertaining but there were a lot of questions about why the characters were being so stupid as well as why characters seemed to evaporate into thin air up until the major sequence at the end.",1387411200,,2282,4.410926365795724
5596379,4,B00BEIYGT8,"You know, the concept behind this film was great: each year, some time in the near future, U.S. laws have changed so that complete lawlessness is allowed on one day of the year. Everything that follows from this concept, in the imagined version of the U.S., is fascinating: companies have swooped in to provide security for people who want to hide in their homes during the purge, and those who go out breaking laws have become vaguely cultish in their once-annual killing sprees.

Okay, so it's a cool concept that really gets you thinking about a slightly alternative way of dealing with deviance.

But what the film becomes is more of an ""I'm trapped in my house with psychos trying to get in!"" type of thing. 90% of the film focuses just on one family (Ethan Hawke's crew) and how they deal with 1) an intruder, and 2) a bunch more intruders thirsty to kill them. So it's a big bloody mess by day break, and even some jealous neighbors get in on the act.

So here's the problem: what happens in this movie is that the really cool and interesting part -- the notion of US becoming governed by a pressure-release killing day -- gets under examined so that we can sit there watching a home invasion movie. Blah. A good idea poorly executed, I say.

UPDATE: I think the sequel to this film is even better than this original. It covers way more ideas about this great societal concept of control through release.",1387411200,,1411,4.52156862745098

5596575,3,B00BEIYGT8,"First, I hate films about dumb people doing dumb things. This had an intriguing concept that was clouded by stupidity that masked as humanity. Basically, it was dumb. However, it did do a fine job to illustrate several good points. When faced with any kind of danger, Always, always take care of your own first. Never put the life of a stranger before your own. Never, ever completely trust others, and for those that don't have children, be glad for it.
Just think, this night could have all been avoided if the young boy, the son, Charlie didn't let in a strange man on the worst possible night of the year. So, was your life worth the strangers life? Was it worth your familys? Think of that before you extend your help to someone else.

SPOILER ALERT:
 Id like to ask the son, Hey, kid, was it worth it? Are you proud that you helped out a homeless person that got your father killed and your family terrorized?
Of course, I can hear the bleeding heart liberals say that this film shows what happens when we lose our humanity. Maybe. Maybe not. I thought it was better at illustrating what can happen when one lets their guard down and puts someone else, a stranger before their own. It was well done in that point. Am I a cynic?

5596620,3,B00BEIYGT8,"Laughable in excess and poorly executed, the 2013 horror film ""The Purge"" is still an interesting take on the most terrifying of occurrences -- the home invasion crime. Such atrocities have been detailed in far more disturbing works including Michael Haneke's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Funny-Games/dp/B003CNBY7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Funny Games</a>, Stanley Kubrick's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Clockwork-Orange/dp/B00125FBTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Clockwork Orange</a>&nbsp;(likely the great inspiration for this film) and Sam Peckinpah's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Straw-Dogs-Unrated-Version/dp/B0002KPHZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Straw Dogs (Unrated Version)</a>. Writer and director James DeMonaco has a good idea, but his film soars off the rails during the frantic second half. It could have been so much more.

In the year 2022, the United States is amazingly crime free thanks to an annual event known as ""The Purge,"" a demented Halloween rendering Shirley Jackson's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lottery/dp/0871292645/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lottery</a>&nbsp;a low-key picnic. It is the one night of the year when residents can commit any crime they wish including murder, with the nation's police taking the evening off. Such a holiday allows American residents to vent their rage without fear of incarceration.

James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) has made a comfortable living selling home security systems protecting well-to-do families from purge criminals. He pulls up to his beautiful home, the kind of picturesque structure one would see next to the par-5 at a country club, and has dinner with his attractive family, including wife Mary (Lena Headey) and his two truculent teenagers (Adelaide Kane, Max Burkholder).

Naturally, the Sandin's home has the state-of-the-art security system. As the purge alarm sounds, a sort of tornado warning siren, James presses a button and huge metal doors slide down to cover the structure. With security cameras surrounding the house, the Sandin family kicks back to watch the ""fun."" At this point, the film loses it.

DeMonaco has assembled a terrific cast for the family, and each actor gives an earnest performance. Hawke especially has evolved into one of the best actors working today. Perhaps not destined for superstar status, his fine work raises ""The Purge"" several notches, akin to his great performance in the recent horror classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sinister/dp/B00BHNQ5XK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sinister</a>.

I don't have a problem with events ratcheting up the suspense, including an injured African-American man (Edwin Hodge) who runs into the neighborhood begging for help. He's being chased by a fiendish gang of Caucasian college students adorned in costumes, masks and machetes. You see, the dirty secret of the purge is low-income residents cannot afford security systems, and thus are the main targets during the night of murder -- a sort of final solution conveniently cleansing the land of poverty.

This thrill-kill cult is led by an unblinking, sadistic ring leader (Rhys Wakefield) with all the subtlety of Charles Manson -- a character so over the top he capsizes the entire film. For multiple reasons, they surround the Sandin's home and prepare to break in, leading to the film's best scene when Hawke's James admits his security system is not foolproof, serving more as a deterrent.

The film enters the neighborhood of dull routine as every person with a gun can fire with deadly expertise, and the method the cult breaks in is akin to Tonto pulling down jail bars with nothing more than a horse and rope. For reasons not entirely clear, the family is separated throughout the spatial house with hallways as endless as Kane's Xanadu.

Less is more with material like this, but DeMonaco does not trust his audience. If you're going to film an analogy exposing a flawed society consumed with repressed violence, don't embrace the mayhem for box office appeal. He's created some interesting characters. Why force them into implausibility and derivative shoot-outs?",1385683200,,4316,6.181666666666667

5596778,4,B00BEIYGT8,"Much better than expected. Based on the previews I kind of expected America after the Purge to be a panacea with a couple of exceptions, and was prepared to be disgusted. That was only the previews, however-- the clear undertones suggest that a whole lot of people have been duped by a small number of powerful and influential politicians; many people are truly uncomfortable with it, and the rest are swayed by a relentless propaganda campaign.

Additionally, it becomes clear quite early that the goal of the Purge is not to ""get your violence out"" like the propaganda suggests, but it is explicitly to get rid of the undesirables-- the poor, the unemployed, the homeless. This is where it gets viciously good-- the ""purgers"" see it as their right to eliminate people they don't like and get a truly perverse pleasure in the fact they are allowed, or even encouraged, to do so by their own government. Their leader, Australian actor Rhys Wakefield, is magnificent as the charming psycopath in a suit who could kill people tonight and sell mutual funds tomorrow.

There are a couple of disappointments-- for instance, for all the hype for the latest security system, how easy it ultimately was to break in (Panic Room this isn't, unfortunately); the overuse of the last-second rescue from out of nowhere; a couple of plot lines that fizzled or seemed pointless.

However, all in all I have been recommending it. The directing is tight, the creepy scenes are really, truly, creepy, and there are a couple of surprises in the mix as well. I give it 7/10 and 4/5.",1384300800,,1561,4.774074074074074

It was mainly about one family's experience during one night of the event. I think that individual stories would have made a good movie, maybe even a good new tv show! Again, it is worth the time to see it once.

I streamed it from Amazon and was quite disappointed. First, I purchased the HD version but was unable to play it due to some incompatibility with my system.

Unfortunately this movie has none of that but some irrational and illogical plot turns that ruin the story. The action is lacking for most of the movie and when the action does finally arrive, this movie strays into something different entirely with some goofy subplot with the neighbors. The acting is subpar as well as I expected a bit more from Ethan Hawke but this movie almost seemed B-movie-ish with its flat acting, dumb storyline and mostly boring predictable action with twists and turns that are just do dumb that it is ridiculous.

The Purge (2013) **
D: James DeMonaco
C: Ethan Hawke, Lena Headey, Max Burkholder, Adelaide Kane, Edwin Hodge, Rhys Wakefield, Tony Oller, Arija Bareikis
P: In 2022, under a nation reborn, with crime & unemployment at an all time low, an annual purge is held in which it is legal to commit any and all crimes, including murder.

On one hand, The Purge is thought provoking and the type of film that will get people talking. Would you participate in the purge? What kind of activities would you or those that you know of engage in during a purge? What would we do for safety if you decided to stay in? Would you band up with your neighbors? Could you even trust your neighbors?

The idea that in trying to be above it all, the film's protagonist becomes savages in of themselves by trying to protect their home is intriguing. There's also a surprising plot twist in the film's final act. Critics and audiences alike have debated about whether the film is able to fully take advantage of its ingenious concept. Whether The Purge fully took advantage of this idea isn't my issue with the film.

My problem with The Purge is that the film mistakes sudden gun blasts for genuine suspense. My problem with The Purge is that their isn't enough teasing & taunting between the protagonist and the antagonist. If there was a purge occurring, if my home was being invaded, some of the emotions I would feel during that time would be fear, apprehension, tension, unease, confusion, disorientation, claustrophobia, etc. - emotions I never once felt while watching this film. That's definitely a problem. My problem with The Purge is that it lacks an understanding of how to craft suspense, terror and panic. Instead, melodrama involving the main characters takes the forefront distracting from the film's main event- The Purge.

Writer / director James DeMonaco knows how to make a good story. He just doesn't know how to tell it, stage it or properly execute it. [R] 85 mins.",1383868800,3,2052,4.752808988764045

5596985,1,B00BEIYGT8,"THE PURGE recalls immediately important works, like the classic short shorty by Shirley Jackson THE LOTTERY, and THE HUNGER GAMES as well.  Unlike those works of literature, THE PURGE is all horror movie clich, plot holes, and video game killings.  Like THE LOTTERY and HUNGER GAMES, it takes place in a fictional USA that has devised a new way of dealing with hatred, crime, and murder. MURDER becomes legalized by the state for a period of time, in order to weed out the sick, poor or marginalized. (Referring to war perhaps?) However, the Purge is a good premise, with an execution devoid of humanity or artistic subtlety.  Hunger Games' characters have meaning and context; they evolve and develop during the film. THE PURGE might have worked well, as a 15 minute film (Its hardly even 80 minutes long, as it is). If they could have had the family all cozy, interspliced with various ""freak out"" murders, while condensing all the running around and hiding, I could have liked the film. Or, if the film showed how unjust the PURGE was to elderly, disabled, or the poor, I would have enjoyed that. (Instead of having these ideas narrated by the ""nightly news"" on their TV sets.) But the film had all the depth and insight of a cheap ""shoot 'em up"" video game. Unfortunately, I had to fast forward repeatedly during an 80 minute long film, barely watching more than 15-20 minutes of the movie.  Like a video game, much of the film had characters running around with a gun in their hands,  thru long dark hallways and big rooms, looking to shoot someone.  The invaders who were shot, were neither tragic figures, nor arch villains. They were at best ciphers.

The major plot hole, was when the 11 year old kid disarmed the security system, in order to be a nice guy for a stranger.  And after he caused all the trouble, the family never said a single word to condemn his behavior. (EXTREMELY unbelievable!) There was absolutely NO REASON for the kid to know the disarm code, especially when the family kept saying he was too young to understand the purge.  The major events in the film occurred, without any context to psychological reality. Its hard to believe, that an entire society could become psychopathic for just 12 hours, and then return to normal. Human behavior doesn't work that way. (which is why the participants in the HUNGER GAMES were so destroyed by the experience.) You either have a conscience or your don't.  The teens who break in, recalled the film FUNNY GAMES, but without any true horror, since you never view the teens in THE PURGE as anything other than evil.  There's no deception, no appearance verses reality.  Imagine a video game, where you just go kill people thruout the game, and nothing else happens. That's EXACTLY what the film reminds me of.

IF you want to explore this premise, that society can condone war or capital punishment, in order to weed out the poor or weak, to feed the darkest drives in humanity, then read THE LOTTERY,  or the HUNGER GAMES.  If you want to watch a video game where everybody gets shot, without using a controller, then check out this film.  However, if you find yourself so bored that you just fast forward between killings to see who survives, don't say I didn't warn you.",1383609600,8,3244,4.674868189806678

5597142,1,B00BEIYGT8,"The basic premise of this movie could have been interesting....with better acting and a better storyline.  Instead, the movie is a thinly veiled vehicle for anti-white bigotry and propaganda.  You probably have some idea of the plot.  One night a year, law enforcement is suspended and anything goes.  The movie is pretty heavy handed in implying that people are universally evil but, limited to one night a year, they behave themselves the rest of the year.  There is some minor suggestion that this may have worked simply because Americans, enraged at all the crime, simply genocide the criminal element every year while law enforcement looks the other way.  In fact, the title, ""The Purge"" has a double meaning.  It is supposed to mean the cathartic purge of evil through one night of sheer wickedness a year.  But a purge could mean a selecting out and eliminating of a problematic element (and has been used that way multiple times in history).  Here is where the movie screws it up.  Those doing the purging are the very caricature of evil and the movie goes out of its way to portray white people, especially rich white people as either cowards who hide behind fortress walls or unreasonable psychopaths.  The victim is, of course black.  Since that is almost the exact opposite of how things are in real life, only this is like the millionth time today, some media has rammed that lie down my throat, the movie gets an F where its poor acting and tendency to drag would give it a D.  D minus, actually for the random scene where the girls boyfriend hides out in the home and attempts to murder her father for no particular reason whatsoever (because... you know....the way to impress a girl is by killing her family).  The magic black guy is, of course, a war hero.  And never mind the fact that black people refuse combat roles for the most part in every war ever waged.

This movie could have not been a total wash if they simply eliminated the black guy as the victim and not went there.  It could, in fact, have been a great movie, if they made him a criminal scumbag, hiding out from the one night a year when law abiding folk are allowed to hunt him down like a dog in revenge.  Throw in a few surviving family of one of his victims.

The movie has nowhere near the honesty, courage or even chutzpah to go there.  But it does far worse than play it safe.  It is a blatant attempt to lie about who is doing evil in our society.  In the end, it fails even at that.....being so heavy handed and unrealistic as to be unbelievable.....revealing its agenda and leaving an overall bad taste in the mouth.",1383091200,4,2611,4.522388059701493

5597274,2,B00BEIYGT8,"Perhaps I'm just too dark and jaded, but in order for a movie to be good you have to care about the fate of the main characters.  Having said that, I'm going to tell you why this movie is bad (spoilers will be included).

You can read the premise of the movie elsewhere, so I'll assume you're familiar with it by now.

It basically all starts with Ethan Hawke's character.  At first it seems like he's taken the necessary precautions to keep his family safe during the purge.  He basically turns his house into a fortress and he's also not afraid to exercise his 2nd amendment rights to owning firearms.  I was impressed by this.  Where he failed however was to take ""The Purge"" seriously and he left the room where he monitors his security cameras and controls the steel doors to his ""fortress"" unattended.

This is where his idiotic little son comes into play and hearing the desperate cries of a wounded citizen begging for help just outside their front door, he decides to open up the steel doors and let the guy into their house.  Keep in mind that all crime is legal right now, so if this wounded citizen wants to come in and murder his whole family, the law is going to allow it.

Right about this same time, the daughter's boyfriend (who somehow snuck into the house despite it being locked up like an impenetrable fortress) decides that this is the perfect night to kill his girlfriend's dad.  So he takes a shot at dad right at the same time the homeless citizen comes through the door.  Dad fires back and kills the boyfriend.  In the midst of the chaos the homeless guy decides this is his chance to disappear somewhere inside the house.

Now let's pause for a second.  If some stranger, on a night where crime is legal, made it into your house, you would think priority #1 would be making sure all of your family members are together and safe and either eliminating the possible threat (the homeless guy) or at least making sure he's not a threat.  But what does dad in his infinite wisdom do?  Well he huddles up with wife and son and leaves his daughter completely forgotten in the house.  The wife even had a chance to corral her but let her decide to walk away because she was so upset about her poor boyfriend getting killed.  Which leads me to another point... she didn't seem to give a crap that her boyfriend just tried to kill her dad, she was only concerned that the boyfriend was dead and apparently couldn't have cared less if dad had been shot or injured in the exchange of gunfire... but I digress...

Long story short a group of young adults with bloodlust and wearing masks had been hunting the homeless guy and they want to finish the job and they demand that dear old dad release the homeless guy to them so they can ""purge"" him from this world... otherwise they're going to pull the doors off their hinges and come in and kill everyone.  Dad initially agrees then has a crisis of conscience and decides they can't just offer the guy up as a sacrificial lamb so he decides they're going to hunker down and weather the storm.  Not the choice I would have made, but I can understand his decision here from a moral standpoint.  Now at this point you would think dad would have learned something from his experiences and have the family get together and stay together for whatever comes their way.  Instead he lets wife, son and daughter wander off on their own throughout the house to fend for themselves.

The mask wearing psychos come in and kill dad, then just when it looks as though they're going to kill wife, daughter and son as well, the next door neighbors come in and kill the mask wearing psychos and appear to have saved the day... only to find out that the neighbors hate this family as well (i almost can't blame them) and they want to kill wife/son/daughter themselves.  The next part you could see coming a mile away... the homeless guy they allowed inside comes to the rescue and saves the family, holding the neighbors at gunpoint.  Now given that crime is still legal for the next few hours, you'd think this would be the perfect opportunity for the wife to not only avenge her husband's death, but to also eliminate this threat altogether.  Instead she decides to just keep them at gunpoint until the timer of ""the purge"" runs out and crime is illegal again, and sends them on their way.

As soon as the idiot son let the homeless guy in, I was hoping he would die for being an idiot.  Then I realized the dad was an idiot for leaving the ""unlock"" button unattended so I hoped he would die too.  I hoped the daughter would die for caring more about her boyfriend that just tried to murder her father, then she did her own father.  Then I hoped the wife would die for letting a perfect opportunity slip away to eliminate her neighbors as a threat.

So in conclusion, not only did I not care about the fate of the main characters because they were each and every one idiots, I actually hoped they would die for their stupidity (but only one did).  Bad movie.",1382918400,13,5004,4.438730853391685

I can't explain too much without spoiling the limited suspense, but I can say this; The first 30 minutes or so, there is some good build up and they explain a lot of what the purge is all about, without boring you. However, once the action starts, you have to start questioning why the story goes the way it did. It almost seems like they started with the ended they intended to have (a moral aspect to the purge), but it seems like they didn't put much thought into making it a good story of how the characters end up getting there. I do think the actors did a good job, especially Ethan Hawke, but just couldn't understand why they didn't put more of a unique story to go along with the premise of the movie.

5597279,4,B00BEIYGT8,"A good movie, but not one to watch a second time. Definitely worth taking a look at on a dark night...",1382918400,,102,3.9047619047619047
5597280,3,B00BEIYGT8,"As with most movies, I am guilty of perusing an internet movie database to see what everyone else thought of the movie I'm about to see.  And like most movies, I normally take this with a grain of salt.  Because we've all been there: one person says the movie sucked - you liked it; and another one says the movie was the best thing since unicorns - you hated it.  So I watched this with an open mind.

The premise is what really drew me in: once a year, the government allows the citizens of the US to basically go all L.A. Riot on people with the intention of 'getting it out of their systems.'  Allowing this has supposedly lowered the unemployment rate and dropped the crime rate the other 364 days.  Taken at face value, this movie could have gone in so many other ways than what the writers/director chose.  Instead, The Purge tells the story from the perspective of a security systems salesperson who appears to be profiting from the annual purge, because, let's face it, if you knew there was a free-for-all-killing-spree once a year, wouldn't YOU want the best security system?  ADT should have paid big bucks to get their name in on this!

Unfortunately, only from the opening credits do you get a REAL sense of how the annual purge feels from purge feed cameras from all over the US.  That's it.  You never get any of this the rest of the movie.  Instead, there's a lot of talk about it and the entire night of purging centers around the Sandin's.  Now, given the fact that this movie was very low budget, I can appreciate the fact that they weren't able to invest a lot in sub-plots and had to resort to shock value in the opening credits (which is basically the hook of the movie); but they could have factored in a lower income family nearby for reasons I'll explain later.

The movie attempts to factor in that even though the purge seems to be openly accepted by society (it's all over the news and radio; even mentioning about how great the economy is because of it), there's still a moral dilemma involved - especially when you see someone begging and pleading for help.  It also factors in that no one is safe from the wrath of human thinking.  And you get the feeling right away that the other people in the neighborhood are jealous.  And it actually executes on these pretty well.  However, there's a lot it missed the mark on.  Aaaaand...go:

1. If it's 2022, security systems (especially the most expensive) are STILL hackable?  I mean, if the purge is such a big event where there is NO law enforcement, wouldn't Mr. Sandin's company create unhackable security systems?  I agree youngsters are pretty nerdy, but c'mon, it was too easy.  And if they were able to easily cut the power, couldn't they have just as easy opened the security doors?  Why even go through the trouble of turning the lights off?

2. Eliminate the boyfriend.  I mean, they actually DID eliminate him, but I meant from the script.  He served no purpose.  He had a brief role and then was killed.  And very shoddy I might say.  Everything in movies must help drive the story along - this didn't.  You immediately get the notion the bf is going to play some role, especially when he's seen in the house after lockdown.  You start to wonder if he's part of the whole master plan.  Instead, he wants to kill the dad because he won't let him see his daughter?  !?!  ""Honey, I killed your dad, the man who raised you and gave you everything you ever wanted, so that we could be together.  Will you marry me?""  Seriously?  Anyway, moving on...

3. Everyone seems way too comfortable that there's a stranger in the house.  And while we're on the subject of the stranger...how about a bit more back story on him?  Why did they want him so bad?  There are literally thousands of homeless people...why that one?  Maybe he was part of a resistance against the purge and were out to stop the people purging.  Like, purging the purgers.  Because this guy was a beast with a gun.  Anything other than he just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.  Furthermore, homeless people normally have a place to go to eat and sleep called ""the shelter""...surely by then there would be a shelter to keep them safe the purge, no?  Maybe that could have been a great premise...homeless people boarded up in a homeless shelter banding together to save themselves from the annual purge.

4. Your boyfriend just tried to kill your dad and there's a bloody stranger in the house, what do you do?  Drag your dead boyfriend to your room, cry over him, ignore the fact he just tried to kill your dad, and ignore that the bloody stranger in your house could be trying to kill you.  Go ahead and run from your parents when they try to help you after the lights go off, too.  Teenagers.  Ugh.

5. I realize it's a big house, but is it so big that others couldn't hear all of the gunshots and not come running to that one spot?

6. Dozens of state of the art cameras to watch what's going on outside and you don't have one single camera watching the INSIDE of your house?

7. You've got a bunch of crafty youngsters who just took out a state of the art security system only to be taken out by a group of ritzy wine drinking neighbors who rush in like agents from the Matrix.  Poor execution.

8. You have a house bigger than most people dream about.  You have a top-of-the-line (albeit very hackable) security system.  You live in a neighborhood not prone to purges.  And yet you're jealous your neighbor has a bigger house than you and makes more money?  And THAT'S your reason for wanting to purge?  I realize greed is powerful, but this just seemed way too rushed.

9. All of your neighbors just tried to mass execute your entire family and you choose to make them wait until the purge is over?  Well that should make for some awkward block parties the other 364 days of the year.  Basically you just gave them 364 days to think about how they're going to kill you.  And you couldn't say anything more clever than a speech about peace?  It just seemed too rushed.

Did anyone else notice the toy that Max's remote toy looked a lot like a toy from Toy Story?

So given a small budget, the movie wasn't that bad.  It could have just been executed a bit better.  A lot of times, I'm happy with the way the story of a movie unfolds; this one, not so much.  The Sandin's narrowly escaping their multi-million dollar safe haven to the confines of the stranger's homeless shelter area and making a stand there would have been so much more entertaining.  It would have given more back story to the stranger and more effectively shown that it doesn't matter how much money you have - you're always vulnerable.  However, some people felt they did something right because there's already a sequel in the mix.  Maybe Mrs. Sandin attempts to purge her neighbors as revenge.",1382918400,3,6835,4.456012913640032

5597334,3,B00BEIYGT8,"I had high hopes for a movie with such an interesting concept, but after the initial set up of the annual Purge, it became just another shoot-em-up.  Of course there were tense moments when people intent on killing were actually in James' and Mary's house and you didn't know when they would jump out.  There are two surprising twists, but you pretty well knew what was going to happen and who was going to die from the beginning.

The annual Purge lasts for 12 hours in which you could commit any crimes you wished without consequences.  It was believed that this was part of the reason crime rates are negligible at this time (year 2022).  The Purge allows people a release for all the hate, anger and aggression bottled up inside them.  James (Ethan Hawke) sells security systems that keep the people safe who do not feel the need to be violent during the Purge.  He is the top seller in his company, and specifically in his own neighborhood.  The night of the Purge, James arms the system.  However, his son Charlie sees a terrified man fleeing toward their house screaming for help, disarms the system and lets him in.  Some arrogant creeps are right behind him threatening James and his family if they don't send the man out.

If you're one who doesn't like terrorizing or the cat and mouse game of the bad guys toying with the good guys, you won't like this.  Not for children obviously, not even teens I'd say but everyone is different and maybe you'll find it not that bad for teens.  While I like thrillers and action movies, this really missed on the thrilling aspect but had some action with a bit of horror in it.",1382313600,,973,4.111111111111111
5597585,2,B00BEIYGT8,and predictable not to mention it was impossible to tell what was going on since it was in the dark with them running around with flash lights most of the time. Could have been a great movie because of the story line but didn't make the grade.,1382313600,2,243,4.191489361702128
5597586,1,B00BEIYGT8,"I'll start by saying that I am true horror fan.  Even when I am marginally impressed with what goes on, I go 2 stars.  So the fact that I give the Purge One Star should tell you something.  Now, I was really looking forward to this movie and wanted to see it in the theaters, but then life happened and I wasn't able to.  The premise of the movie is sick.  I mean, seriously though...why didn't I think of that?  And even the first few minutes are okay and you're thinking ""alright, this could get real good, real quick.""  And then, well, it just doesn't.  There is no substance to the characters and no point in having at least 2-3 of them there (especially the creepy kid with the fixation on electronics and inventions, it's just stupid).  This movie deserves the bad reviews because it has THE BEST HORROR PREMISE IN YEARS!  And they still managed to blow it...not just blow it...but EPICALLY blow it.  The kid with the toys should have taken himself out of the movie and gotten behind the camera to direct or maybe re-write the ending.  'Cause even a child could have done a better job.  Fail.",1382313600,8,1098,4.402985074626866
5597587,4,B00BEIYGT8,I have never been one for the home-invasion sub genre of horror films but i like the approach this one took. The characters could have been more rounded but it is what is. Its a horror film plain and simple.,1382227200,,207,4.2
5597588,2,B00BEIYGT8,"I mean it was cool I guess for a modern thriller... but I mean the acting was meh, and the premise was a little childish. The relationship between the family members was just ridiculous, in no way did it represent a real family. So to end it, I'll just say that I could not relate to the family at all making it very difficult to care about the premise, which I felt was fairly extreme.",1382227200,2,386,4.16
5597589,1,B00BEIYGT8,I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone - The ending made no sense at all - it was a movie that was trying to be a scary movie with no real plot at all.,1382227200,4,154,3.5588235294117645

5597592,5,B00BEIYGT8,"From looking at the movie cover, I thought this was going to be another horror flick. Don't get me wrong, I love horror movies, but the latest releases have been garbage. However, this is not a 100% horror movie and definitely not garbage. It is a cross between a scary movie and a thriller. The suspense is what gets you because you never know what to expect. Ethan Hawke is great and the boy who plays his son was excellent. I don't want to give too much away for those who haven't seen the movie yet, but the concept of the movie does make you think. If this was to happen in real life would the outcome be same. I would think so, but believe the opposite of what the government and law enforcement think. Crime would go up instead of down because the adrenaline to kill is now within people. They would be tempted to do it again way before the end of the year. I don't know what others think, but what I do know is this is one of the best movies I've seen this year.",1382227200,,970,4.137566137566138

5597762,4,B00BEIYGT8,"Good flick, but could've been much better. The concept is great ... One lawless night annually, where anything goes and all emergency services are withheld for 12-hours. The idea: to allow everyone to ""purge"" themselves of all hatred and negative emotion in a single night, making crime go down the rest of the year. I have to admit, the prospect of retribution would be tempting. Who wouldn't make a list? The only question would be who to place at the top ... the Banker, the lawyer or the ex-spouse! However, the movie had some shortcomings. Without spoiling anything, I will say that they could've done a little more with it, the storyline and tempo could've been better and there is a rather large, rather obvious disappointment that kind of leaves you wanting to put the movie's writers on your own PURGE list!

5597766,3,B00BEIYGT8,"The other reviews of this film will fill you in pretty much on the movie. It I worth watching, a predictable, kind of bloody, scary movie.  What I found interesting is that the concept was lifted, almost entirely, from an old Star Trek episode.  Anybody remember it? The moment I began watching this movie, that Star Trek episode sprang to mind.  In the episode, Kirk, Spock and the landing party land on a planet where everyone is peaceful, content and law abiding.  It turns out that the entire populace is being controlled by a master computer that they virtually worship as a god, and call ""Landru"".  The computer controls their actions and thoughts, giving them peace and prosperity, except for one day a year---their ""festival"".  During this day, all controls are turned off, and the entire population goes wild, rioting, burning, raping, murdering.  As one of the characters in episode said---one day a year of complete cancer. By this method Landru purges the negative emotions of the humans he controls, and incidentally reduces the population.

The storyline is intense and the acting is top notch, however, I felt that there was too much left on the table.  Where the story was solid, there are many areas of this movie left unexplored.  The overall product was thin but was well worth the watch.  I will most likely watch it again but I can't see this as a top hit but more of a cult creation much like SAW.

I had read that it was an anti gun director, but I never saw that part.
You pretty much know going into the movie what it is about. The scenes were good and ""popping out""
I thought the guns were portrayed in a realistic way. The dad could fight, but his tactics were no good.
The shotgun was silly, but that's just Hollywood, and that revolver.... What was that? A .454 casull?
Short barrel but monster round.

5598086,4,B00BEIYGT8,"I was skeptical about this film because of the somewhat unbelievable premise, but the ads caught my attention and I finally got a chance to sit down with it.

There isn't a dull moment in this movie, which works well - because if the viewer is given too much time to think about it the suspension of disbelief could crack and you'll wind up picking it apart. The cinematography is done well, and the actors play their parts well, particularly Lena Headey who has that rare ""it factor"" and is destined to break out even further than her role in Game of Thrones. Hawke is on the job as always, it's not the most demanding performance for him, but he plays it well and rarely disappoints.

In summary, if you're an absolute realist and don't have the ability to suspend disbelief for the sake of art and entertainment, this movie is not for you. However, if you enjoy a suspenseful thrill ride, and like movies such as ""Judgement Night"" and ""Attack the Block,"" this one's up your alley and worth a watch.",1381708800,,1001,4.4945054945054945

5598088,1,B00BEIYGT8,"This movie was one of the dumbest, idiotic, part racial, stereo typical, crap I have ever seen. *SPOILER ALERT*  So let me give you a quick run down, you have 1 day out of the year where all crime is legal and this is helps eliminate crime to 1 %. Ok that sounds like a bunch a bull but I'm a watch it and see where it goes its creative and seems like it can be awesome. As I continue watching the movie it gets to the point to explaining more of the situation and rules of the Purge. Basically if you don't have money then you're dead. If you're poor and homeless on the street you're a main target and I find it funny how they had scenes of African Americans acting like gorillas and most of the violence on the screen focusing on minorities acting crazy on the news. Really it's like that ok so at this point I'm feeling a little bla. As I continually watch this I'm thinking this is really bad acting, but in some movies they actually want it to be like that so I even forgave the partridge rich family generic happy go luck acting.
The dad Ethan Hawke creates one of the best security systems every made and is one of the richest guys in the town with a beautiful house and family which is good for a beginning plot you have the conflict which is the system and you have the story building up.
Then it starts to get stupid you have a boyfriend that the dad disagrees with and makes him go and locks up the house for the purge. Then every one has to just be calm and chill for one night, and you telling me they couldn't do that. So you have the security systems on and every thing and for some reason a guy is on one of the security cameras running screaming for help. I don't know how, but they family leaves the security system alone with a boy.
We know kids do things to opposite to there parents, but if I knew my family was in question of that night there is no way in hell my kid would be messing with my security stuff. Then the kid knows all the codes WTF. What sense does that make that's like putting a code on the TV to block porno, but giving the kid the code it defeats the purpose seriously.
So I'm thinking I'm a bite my lip this is going to get better and I started to find my self losing brain cells watching every min of this stupidity. Ok so the kid lets this stranger in which the kid needs a whipping of a life time because he is a spoiled brat. Honestly you don't know what this guy could have did and what he is capable of doing. Okay so you have some coo coo rich spoiled guys come and act a foo. The first thing I notice all rich all white okay so I'm already getting to the point to where I'm like wow seriously. Then let's make matters worst why did they chase this guy down? The Purge is to focus on killing the people we hate and don't like, and that don't have money. Awesome so now I feel like I'm watching an episode of roots where the KKK is chasing a black man and now I'm pissed at the stupidity of the family and the small messages I'm picking up in the movie. At this point I just try to lower my thought and not think too much of it and calm down but every time I calmed down the question stupidity start hyping me back up.
How are you going to have a multi million security system and have it get torn down by a truck wow seriously? The boyfriend even stayed in the house and that is sad how the heck did he get passed the dad like that.  I'm just saying if you use to having a secured house hold every year you don't check the whole house before you lock up like regular people tend to do before they go to bed or some one leaves.
Let's get even more stupid the group of individuals demand the family to turn in the stranger that they let in. If they do that they will not harm any one in the family, now of course it's not guaranteed which would have been my first thought, but they catch the guy. Then this boyfriend of the girl comes out yelling talking about I love your daughter bla bla your in the way then tries to shoot the father like really. Who does that? Do you honestly think she will want you after that you psycho. I already was thinking the girl was stupid to begin with but then when I seen how dumb the boyfriend was I thought they where great for each other.
Well any way dad kills the kid feels a little bad about girl goes run her head in the wall are what ever she is hurt because her boyfriend is dead. Then they start searching for the stranger find him and the movie lags. They decide to help him then decide to throw him into the pit then decide to help him its like make up your dang mind. How are you going to have over 20 min of the movie on a family trying to figure out what to do with a stranger? Any way they don't turn in the guy, the guys that was chasing him pull the door down with a truck and they come in shooting and acting retarded. It was like watching a bunch of clowns from a rodeo shoot each other and do stupid stuff. The villain was a decent villain I mean he made you want to punch the taste out of his mouth at least.
Then through all of this circus and comedy act of a movie they kill the star of the movie what kind of crap was that.  I guess they was trying to be different I would understand if he was the last to die but they kill the star then the family relies on the stranger they saved.  So okay good moral to the story all good deeds don't go to waste, but in this case you already messed up the moral by showing stupidity over resolve. Honestly the whole thing wouldn't have happened if the guy wasn't let in now you got a family with out a father.
Any way the next door neighbor get involved and help take out the guys that break in, the family think they are safe until the neighbor show envy and jealousy about the family. Just because the family makes the most money out of every one in the town and at this point I'm like wow the neighbor acting is horrible. Some how the family get out of a tight situation and one neighbor is killed the rest the wife makes sit in the room and scolded them to wait until 7am when the purge is over. Now I'm thinking to my self you need to be scolding that boy that let strangers in the house. Then lets them go, what make the family thing they want try to come back? I guess they are going to move or some thing all and all this was some thing I can live with out.
Every thing was predictable I think the only time I was surprised is when the father got stabbed. I really didn't like the concept the rich taking out all the poor to make a better world it sounded more like some illuminati type of junk. The acting was pretty bad I mean there is better actors on barney, There was too many questionable things, It's fine for a movie to have some questionable thing but man I should have to question every thing every 10 mins, the things they did was unnatural which I wasn't too surprised at that because most horror movies aren't things we would normally do in the real world, The principals of the movie and plot was bad, It was badly written the language and dialog was horrible that may be why the acting seem so bad, and all and all I can keep going but it was horrible. I bashed and wasted enough time with this movie because if you want to be traumatized with thinking what the heck I was thinking? This is a movie that will haunt your mind.

The days of Siskel and Ebert are long gone. Everyone wants to be a movie critic, rather than just reviewing the movie.

It is not a horror movie. It is a drama based in a near-future world, 2022, and it is certainly not predictable. Well, some things were, but not to the extent that the haters make it sound. This film takes us inside the home of one family during a 12 hour period of terror.

Weird and unusual, the plot is non-traditional and the tension keeps you on the edge of your chair for much of the movie. Acting and stunts were delivered flawlessly. Ethan Hawke doesn't perform in crap movies.

5598154,5,B00BEIYGT8,"This movie was great. It started out a little slow for me though. It's all about the Purge- a Government law that you can kill, rape, steal from anyone for a certain amount of time. No ambulance, or police will help as they are off duty all of this time. The father (Ethan Hawke) installs home security barriers for people's homes and he's sold a lot of them to the families in his neighborhood making him number one in the company. He doesn't realize that people saw the home expansion he added to his home and they are bitter. Once The Purge sirens go off, his son decides to let a stranger into the home which to me was so annoying. The stranger was screaming for help but I'm not sure I would've done that. So now the guy is in the family home which brings the ""group"" of killers who want him dead and if the family doesn't let him go, they will kill them too. There's a flaw to the home security system: In order to keep safe it needs electricity which the perpetrators immediately cut off to the home, break in and terrorize the family. I was impressed with Ethan Hawke's fighting skills and killing them. The movie really got quite intense as he's fighting them. There's a twist at the end and I even re-winded it to watch the end again. I highly recommend this movie. It also makes you wonder what would happen if the Purge was put in place in  our country.

I really regret renting this film. The best character in this film is the main killer. Everyone else is dull and plays to a stereotype. The filmmakers tried too hard to push a point, when the moral should have been: don't be an idiot.

If the characters had any common sense, none of the events would have come to pass. And the story isn't even internally consistent. If the kids were raised in a world where all they knew was the purge, why would they oppose it?  Because it's convenient to the plot.

5598293,4,B00BEIYGT8,"This movie got a lot of bad and lackluster reviews.  Honestly, what did people expect?  A nice walk through the park, perhaps?  Then obviously they were renting the wrong movie!

Yes this movie is disturbing.  Yes it makes you angry and indignant and probably a bit grossed out and disgusted as well.  Isn't that why you want to watch it?  Be honest.

In the movie, it is the year 2022.  Unemployment is at an all-time low of 1 percent.  Crime is way down as well - all in thanks to (according to the government) a yearly government sanctioned ritual called The Purge.  During The Purge, citizens are encouraged to ""purge all their hostile and negative feelings"" by committing any crime they want - EVEN MURDER - without ANY consequences.  There are NO POLICE...no fire department or medical services, either.  On March 22 of every year, for twelve hours, everyone is on their own.

Enter our main characters, an upscale couple called The Sandins.  They live in a rich gated community with their two children.  The husband, James, sells home security systems for his career, and makes a lot of money doing this - naturally, due to The Purge.  Therefore, even though he's not really a BAD person, he does support The Purge (as all good citizens are encouraged to do) since this yearly bloody ritual makes him a boatload of money in his upscale neighborhood.

Unfortunately, all of his neighbors are jealous of how well James is doing financially.

After The Purge commences (there is a scary bull-horn sound and an announcement on the news) the Sandins high-tech security system whirs into action, creating a massive ""lock-down.""  The family assumes they are safe.  However, when the son peers outside on their expensive surveillance equipment, he sees that a bloody stranger has stumbled into their yard, crying and in need of help.  The kind-hearted boy lets this stranger into the Sandin's home - and after that, all hell breaks loose.

A creepy menacing group soon descends upon the Sandin house, demanding the Sandins send the stranger out to them.  ""He was our purge!"" they claim, and they want him back...or ELSE, they will kill the whole Sandin family!

What should the Sandins do?  Should they send this man back out and prove they have lost all humanity, such as others on this horrible night have done?  Or should they risk a deadly home invasion - and the lives of their own family members by not doing what the angry crowd demands?

Now let me be perfectly clear:  This movie will never win any awards.  HOWEVER....if you are looking for plain old suspenseful entertainment....along with a desire to feel grateful that you do NOT live in that futuristic depiction of America - then watch the movie!  It will engage you, I promise.  I found myself talking back to the screen, feeling 100 percent THERE.

The character development is adequate for this sort of movie, I think.  You do get a sense that this is a real suburban family.  There are characters you can route for - which I think is good - such as the son and the bloody stranger, who turns out to be a homeless man.

I realized that The Purge seemed to mostly be about purging society of the poor.  This is indeed a very disturbing aspect of the movie.  Like I said before, though, the movie made me feel grateful for the world I live in now - a world that cares for and helps those in need.  This movie will definitely make you think about things like that!

I think they could have done with out the overly sexy teenage daughter dressed in mini skirt, knee socks, and fake ""school girl"" outfit, looking like an anime character.  Or do they need to toss that sort of cliche into every horror movie to get young male viewers?

All in all I feel The Purge delivered. Before I watched the movie, I was worried I wouldn't like any of the characters.  This thriller is definitely an action packed, edge of the seat ride.  Obviously, this movie should never be viewed by children!  Hopefully, everyone who watches the movie will be deeply appalled by the very idea of it.  If ever anyone thought The Purge was a GOOD idea, I would be very upset!

5598294,5,B00BEIYGT8,"That's the real point behind this movie-the plot, the violence, etc. is all a vehicle to get the audience to think about what course of action they would choose when placed in a very morally challenging situation where lives hang in the balance. In my opinion, this movie easily merits watching again to reconsider the questions it raises. These ideas also extend to the relationship between the individual and society-have you ever been ""thanked"" by a government agent/agency for completing some action in which you actually had no choice? On the other hand, many of the negative reviews of this movie raise valid points. The plot could be stronger, some of the conflict resolution is disingenuous, so if you're looking for a great horror/action/ edge-of-your-seat thriller movie-there are better choices available.

5598386,2,B00BEIYGT8,"When I first saw the trailer for ""The Purge,"" I thought:  that's an interesting (and actually new) idea for a movie.  The ""purge"" is the one night a year that EVERYTHING is legal:  murder, mayhem, torture--ANYTHING to let the good citizens of this country vent.  That is the first big problem I had:  the movie alluded that if you were rich, everything would be fine--you can BUY your safety.  Furthermore, it seemed the only people interested in the purge, were affluent snobs who (I guess) were bored and had nothing better to do.  It seems this has taken care of unemployment, capital crimes, and just about everything else.  That sounds interesting.  And then there's the movie.

Written by James DeMonaco (who also directed), it seems he had no idea what to do with his movie.  There are many scenes that just make no sense.  I won't give any away; you will be able to spot them a mile away!  In fact, this movie is just all over the place.  Its writer and director never knew what he wanted to do with his characters.  There is little backstory.  The movie opens with Ethan Hawke driving home so he can lock down his house and wait until the purge is over.  He sells security systems for the very affluent and feels untouchable in his mansion.  Trouble is, he is VERY touchable.  Trouble starts when his son sees some helpless person trying to find solace before he is slaughtered, and he lets him into their home.  It's all downhill from there.  The final scene just had me shaking my head in disbelief.

The movie is rated R for violence and language.  It stars Ethan Hawke (in a throwaway role) and Lena Headey, who should have stayed on the set of ""Game of Thrones.""

Our movie is set in the not so distant future where unemployment, crime, and poverty are at all time lows.

 And our protagonists are an ordinary family:

*Hardworking dad bringing home the bacon.(He got wealthy as a home security system salesman)
*Stay at home mom who takes pride in her housekeeping. (And a nice house it is)
*Teenage daughter who is dating a boy her parents can not stand.
*Technology geek son.

But this one night is not ordinary. It is the one night of the year that all crimes are legal and all emergency services are off limits. Our family settles down for their lock down with their expensive security system. But at the last minute, a stranger gets in the house. The doors and windows are then secured. And then a group of ""PURGERS"" show up on their lawn. And the family is faced with a dilemma: Do they sacrifice the stranger to the Purgers to save themselves or do they try to save a complete stranger from an unknown fate?

Although, the movie does have psychological issues like this, it does contain quite a bit of violence like close-ups of people getting stabbed and shot in the face.",1380844800,9,1295,4.584415584415584

5598564,5,B00BEIYGT8,"I liked it so well I wanted to get the dvd and watch it again and again.

Unlike Zombies, that in case you were unaware ARE NOT REAL, this could really happen.

The Purge is the ultimate finale of our craziness as seeing ""government"" as the enemy and not wanting government involved in our lives.

Government, in this movie says...""Okay!  For 12 hours one day a year, WE don't exist.  There is no crime that is illegal. There will be no government assistance as far as police, fire or medical.  You are on your own.""

You would think that this would unleash the ""HAVE NOT HORDES!"" to run rampant over all the poor rich people but that is not how it is written.  It is the rich folks who invest in the latest weaponry, sharpen their machete's and go after isolated Have Nots for sport and ultimately, one another.

If I were writing the script for the sequel I would write that the wife and kids leave the gated community whose residence almost annihilate them.  The wife becomes politically active and is working to change this law where her kids have gone to live on the streets and are interested in revenge.  The boy was a computer and mechanical genius who learns how to disarm any security system guided by his late father.

The kids join up with other have nots and form a war machine that will be directed on the gated community that killed their father in the next Purge.
They clean sweep this community including wounding their own mother who comes into harms way trying to stop her kids from going against their pacifist raising.

And then comes the hypocrisy...near the end of the 12 hour period, police of all ilks and the military have formed a perimeter around this community trying to catch the Have Nots  who perpetrated this on these ""poor, helpless"" rich people despite the fact that the law says no crime shall be illegal during this 12 hour period.

The mother, possibly mortally wounded is carried away to...who knows, by her kids and the African American man who she and her family saves in the first PURGE.  They all escape the law enforcement and military round up having come in via para-sail or underground through the water drainage system.

It could be called The Purge II: NEXT YEAR or The Purge II: Revenge of the Have Nots",1377043200,,2253,4.537128712871287

The idea of the movie is very creative, and reminded me of a few laws that have been or are currently in effect. However, the conclusion left me angered, and dissatisfied. Ideally, I wanted a resolution (some change that resulted) due to the events or the purge. At the very least, I wanted there to be a mention of the events that transpired in the movie, and yet there was nothing. That being said, the acting was decent. The ""twist"" at the end of the movie was very apparent to me. If you paid attention, you could see it coming a mile away. Most of the characters were likable (except for the son). He was so stupid and blindly foolish. Another thing that annoyed me was how coddled he was by his mother. At a time like that he needed to realize what his mistakes were so that he didn't continue on the same path. Yet, because of her stupidity, he continued to make the same mistakes over and over again. It was overdone, and extremely annoying. In short, is the movie worth a rental? Yes, only if you are an ADULT! Would I buy it? No.",1371859200,3,1119,4.333333333333333

The film concentrates on one family of some wealth. They lock themselves in their home with steel windows and doors. Unfortunately the outside world has a way of making its way indoors as the film becomes a home break-in movie with a theme, and study in individual character mirroring us as a society. Lena Headey plays ""the mom."" She represents compassion, the ""It is not about who they are, it is about who we are."" The film has some dark comedic moments, sudden plot twists, and things that go bump in the night.

It is very graphically violent. If you are looking for a typical ""horror"" movie, this isn't it. It has more action and suspense than most typical ""thriller"" movies as well.

5598569,3,B00BEIYGT8,"The Purge is a really fun and entertaining movie when you don't think into it too much. On the surface it's a decent thriller about a family being attacked by a group of murderers during a night where for 12 hours all crime is legal. Now, this brings up an endless amount of questions and it gets really aggravating when none of those questions are answered. At no point in time does this movie give any real explanation and it never gets very deep even though this is a pretty original and almost revolutionary idea the plot is malnourished from poor writing.

The acting is atrocious and none of the characters are likeable and at the end of it the whole thing is pretty forgettable except for the idea itself and your own plans and questions that will linger around. Is it so bad that it's an unwatchable movie? Not by any means, it's still very entertaining but it's not scary, intelligent or anything to hype about.

5598570,4,B00BEIYGT8,"The premise behind writer/director James DeMonaco's film THE PURGE is indeed a fantastic one: set in the year 2022, when unemployment nationwide is down to just one percent, and crimes across the board are at an all-time low.  But what if the manner of getting it that was to allow a one-night ""purge"", in which violent behavior was actually sanctioned by the United States government, and largely to rid America of the poor and the indigent?  It is a premise that may seem outrageous; but so too was the idea of a surveillance state as depicted in George Orwell's classic 1948 novel ""1984""; and what has America become since 9/11 but a real-life surveillance state?  Under the right circumstances, it is completely possible that something like THE PURGE might come to pass.

Ethan Hawke portrays a security systems designer whose entire neighborhood, located in the hills above West Los Angeles, owes its very security and safety to his security designs.  It becomes especially important during a twelve-hour time frame from 7 PM to 7 AM on March 21st and 22nd, 2022 known as ""The Purge"", in which violent behavior, including murder, theft, and even rape, will be allowed--and no police or emergency first responders will be on duty.  It is a thing that Hawke and his family, and their neighbors, have gotten used to; and they have also become largely callous when it comes to the potential victims of the Purge, namely the poor who don't have the ability to support themselves with any job or pay approaching anywhere close to what Hawke makes.  But on this particular Purge Night, one of Hawke's children (Max Burkholder), out of the goodness and conscience of his heart, lets a wounded black man (Edwin Hodge) enter the premises, which upsets Hawke tremendously.  To Hawke, Hodge is exactly the kind of target the Purge people want to kill; and when the leader (Rhys Wakefield) of one such Purge group comes to get Hodge, Hawke, his family, and their home come under siege from that group.  Hawke at first advocates handing over Hodge to them (given that the Purge group has already totally crippled what Hawke had once proclaimed a foolproof security system), but his wife (Lena Headey), daughter (Adelaide Kane) and Burkholder, appalled at his descent into cold-blooded ""survival of the fittest"", force the issue.  In the end, they are forced to endure much physical horror and psychological terror until the morning comes.  And does the madness really even end there?

DeMonaco wrote and directed THE PURGE on a budget of just slightly more than $3 million; and apart from the sometimes shaky and unsteady camera work (a trait that came from the quasi-documentary style of films like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and PARANORMAL ACTIVITY), every penny of that $3 million budget shows up here.  There are a number of things that don't quite work the way they should; and some of the acting, especially by Wakefield as the chief Purge instigator, is overly hammy.  In terms of what DeMonaco is basically trying to do with what is certainly a fantastic and crazy premise (one that seems to take a number of shots at right-wing elements of America, up to and including the Tea Party), however, THE PURGE is effective enough.  There is something extraordinarily ironic at rich, upscale people turning on one another, either for harboring a ""filthy swine"" such as Hodge, or for having their supposedly ""foolproof"" security system exposed.  In many ways, it derives its power and plot from many films: the original ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13; A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (the masks worn by Wakefield and his posse); THE BIRDS; NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD; STRAW DOGS (the original 1971 Sam Peckinpah classic); and even THE OSTERMAN WEEKEND (Peckinpah's last, released in 1983).  But these are films that have a kinetic and psychological power that very few other ""horror"" or ""thriller"" films of this kind can have without spiraling into hyper-violent absurdity, and they are films that DeMonaco clearly has learned a lot from.

Hawke does a fairly good job of being a somewhat callous capitalist who grossly underrates the impact that the violent behavior of the night of the Purge will have on his family.  Headey also does a credible job as his wife, who questions his motivations and his morality when, at first, he decides to hand Hodge over to Wakefield, instead of doing the right thing and fighting for his humanity.  In the final analysis, and in terms of its credibility and plausibility, it has to be said that THE PURGE isn't necessarily the best psychological ""horror"" or ""thriller"" film that has ever been.  But it is effective enough to deliver what it promises for its eighty-five minute running time.",1370822400,181,4694,4.901515151515151
5598571,5,B00BEIYGT8,"""The Purge, for its time, is by far one of the most daring and intriguing thrillers and social conscience dramas released in recent memory. While some people might find the concept bewildering to grasp (a 12-hour period known as The Annual Purge involving free, legalised criminal activity), it is nonetheless stronger for consideration than the average ""horror"" film especially when recent discussions about the Second Amendment, poverty, race/class issues, and mental health all have been in the spotlight.

The film, as the trailers might hint, starts off more as a dark and chilling parable and then switch its gears for more conventional thriller devices with the Straw Dogs-like house invasion toward the middle and end of the film. Nonetheless, much of its messages and intrigue are not lost in the mist as many things can be read and interpreted upon (the affluence of preppy university students showcasing their snobbery through racial violence, fear of the very poor and very rich, taking advantage of innocent women).

While much of its glory comes from the themes, The Purge also complements its too realistic for science-fiction, claustrophobic narrative well with intense cinematography, graphic violence, paranoia, and slow-burner pace of frequent domestic threat. Performances are rather good too with Ethan Hawke plays a believably stuck-up security systems consultant and Lena Headey as the fearful yet resilient matriarch of the Sandin family. The soundtrack, with its clever yet unsettling use of Debussy's Claire de Lune, sets to complement a tone to the film that hints paranoia and horror with ""violent peace"" (oxymoronic to say the least).

From a person who hardly goes to see these so-called ""horror"" films (ParaNorman, The Shining, Cabin in the Woods, An American Werewolf in London, and Splice are just a few recent ones I have seen), this one can be construed as more close to horror because of the feeling that you are not safe in your own home but the thriller aspect plays into it moreover due to its realistic albeit futuristic setting. On merit, the film delivers a stronger argument about the trouble vigilantism may bring or provide good or bad and is a good enough film for older audiences to critique and question about much of the film's meaning. On that note, it is also best if you stay in for the credits too so to get the experience of knowing how many of The Annual Purge participants feel glad or feel sorrow.""",1370390400,23,2455,5.041871921182266
