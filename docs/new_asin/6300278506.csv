304080,3,6300278506,"My heading does not refer to the Hulk v. Andre match. At the time, Andre was having serious back problems which later got much worse. If you want to see him in action, watching the movie ""Princess Bride"" is a better choice, and also one where his character is more reminiscent of his true self, as a gentle and caring giant of a man in more respects than one, and, for great moments in Hulk's career, I'd recommend Hulk Hogan v. Ultimate Warrior in Wrestlemania VI, where there's quite a twist at the end when it seems things are progressing just as they always are at the end of Hulk Hogan's matches, and also unusual in being a match between characters who are sort of friends.

Anyway, what makes WM III a wrestling classic is what's arguably the best match ever. It goes down between Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat and Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage, a long display of great wrestling technique, showmanship, suspense and action that is addictively entertaining. A *****+ match

I remember first seeing this around the time of Wrestlemania IV, back when I was so little I still thought wrestling was real, but even considering that the matches are orchestrated and planned beforehand, this is a thrilling one to watch.

Apart from that, Wrestlemania III is pretty much a more mediocre blend of what comes before and after this key match in wrestling history.

If that match is found on any ""best of"" DVD's (I'm not sure what is out there), go for that rather than the Wrestlemania III video.

With the Dragon/Macho Man match pulling it all up, I end up at three stars for this, but if you can't get it any other way, this is worth your hard-earned cash just to watch the most classic bout ever.",1092009600,,1690,4.564356435643564
304081,5,6300278506,"Wrestlemania 3 is one of the most famous wrestling shows ever presented.  Everyone knows about the Hogan-Andre and Savage-Steamboat matches, but this show also contains one of the weirdest matches of all time: King Kong Bundy and 2 midgets vs. Hillbilly Jim and 2 midgets!!  The footage of Bundy slamming one of the midgets is something I doubt we'll ever see again in our PC world.",1085184000,,382,4.7727272727272725
304082,5,6300278506,"""Wrestlemania III"" is regarded by many as one of the greatest Wrestlemania's of all-time and with its indoor attendance record of 93,173, it is hard to disagree. The main event which featured WWF champion, Hulk Hogan defeating the man who many considered to be unstoppable at that time, Andre The Giant featured many historic moments including Hogan's infamous bodyslam of Andre that almost took the roof off the Pontiac Silverdome.
Another match that is considered by wrestling purists to be one of the greatest ever was the legendary battle between Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage and Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat. Many of today's stars look at this classic match as a blueprint for how to pull off a five-star match.
Some other moments saw Alice Cooper accompany Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts to the ring for his match with the Honky Tonk Man, Roddy Piper battled the late Adrian Adonis in a ""hair vs. hair"" match, Junkyard Dog taking on ""King"" Harley Race, and King Kong Bundy nearly crushing punt-sized wrestler, Little Beaver.",1062288000,,1020,4.970760233918129

304084,5,6300278506,"It's debatable whether or ont this is the greatest Wrestlemania but you can't help but give this 5 Stars.  Why?  Well this is what truly made the WWF far bigger, far badder and far better than any other wrestling promotion.  I mean if you can manage to get 93,173 fans into one venue to watch pro-wrestling you must be doing something right!
Can-Am Connection vs. Magnificent Muraco and Ace Cowboy Bob Orton-  A good tag opener.  Rick Martel and Tom Zenk were a good team.  However Bob Orton and Don Muraco are basically punching bags for the Connection. **1/2
Hercules vs. Billy Jack Haynes- An ok match.  Nothing special except when Herc assaults Billy at the end of the match with his chain.  Pretty standard filler though especially considering it ends in a double count out. **
Hillbilly JIm, Little Beaver and Haiti Kid vs. King Kong Bundy, Little Tokyo, and Lord Little Brook- Awful.  Nothing more then a laughable circus match.  Funny though.  Partyicualrily when Bundy squahes a midget. *
Harley Race vs. Junkyard Dog- Too short considering the match stipulations.  Race sells for JYD in a mediocre match.  **
Dream Team vs. Rougeau Bros.- Not bad at all.  The Rougeaus were the good guys here and put on a decent tag against The Dream Team with Dino Bravo.  It ends with the Rougeaus losing but the Dream Team crumbles when The Hammer turns his back on Brutus. ***
Roddy Piper vs. Adrian Adonis- A hair versus hair match.  Roddy's 'farewell' as well but this match mainly consists of Roddy beating up a grostesque looking Adonis.  In the end Adrian loses his hair to Piper and Brutus Beefcake. **
Hart Foundation & Danny Davis vs. British Bulldogs & Tito Santana- A very good entertaining six man tag.  The Harts are the heels here with the referee Danny Davis as a wrestler!  Although a tag championship match between the Harts and Bulldogs would have been better this is still a good match. ***
Butch Reed vs. Koko B. Ware- Nothing memorable.  Standard wrestling filler.  It's not the worst here.  But neither of these wrestlers did anything in the WWF.  Reed wins it but who cares. *1/2
Ricky 'The Dragon' Steamboat vs. Macho Man Randy Savage- Fantastic match.  The best match of '87 for sure.  A great technical match that may very well be the best of both men's careers.  The Dragon ends Savage's lengthly title reign. *****
Honky Tonk Man vs. Jake 'The Snake' Roberts- Another filler match.  Although both men would go on to be bigger stars in the WWF.  Alice Cooper appears in Jake's corner but it doesn't help him win the match. **
Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff vs. The Killer Bees- Meh...nothing much here.  Hard to say this could have been worse.  Especially when Hacksaw  Jim Duggan comes down and costs The Bee the match. *
Hulk Hogan vs. Andre The Giant- The legendary match that changed everything.  Not much of a technical wrestling match however the crowd is so into it that this match and thats what makes this a classic. *****
Overall it's not the best Wrestlemania in my opinion the WWF had made it ot the big time but they hadn't brought out the best yet.  Still legendary though.",1049500800,,3111,4.63919413919414

maybe are just getting into the WWE.I have been watching wrestling since wrestlemania 3 and I got to say that this one is a classic. I agree with someone else that reviewed this that it is
slow and had a lot of bad matches but there were a few great matches as well. You got to remember that these wrestlemania's are old and there not as good as other pay-per views. The Hogan
and Andre match was a classic even though it was fixed when Andre
let Hogan body slam him for the title belt. It is a classic to me because 2 of the greatest Icons in the WWF now the WWE are legends because of this match. However even though Andre passed
away and when Hogan came back to the WWE last year, there is your
proof from the fans and the wrelters on why Hogan and Andre are
Icons and legends and also why Wrestlemania 3 is a classic.",1036195200,,881,4.127906976744186

304089,4,6300278506,"Wrestlemania III will go down as one of the greatest events in World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment history! The Hogan/Andre match was one to behold, since Hogan never expected to put the WWF(WWE) title against this behemoth, who had just turned heel. The other memorable match was, of course, the Savage/Steamboat match for the IC title (which, as of the writing of this review, may be on the verge of extinction). If a WWE fan who has never seen what the company was like in the 80s, they should check it out and they'll know that pro wrestling has drfinitely changed over the years (these days, people like Aretha Franklin, who sang ""America the Beautiful"" at this event, won't go near this environment).

Oh my God! that is bs.(cant say full word.) if you want to see a historic match watch mick foley vs. the taker in the cell. that was great!,1033776000,2,366,4.318840579710145
304122,5,6300278506,"This event STILL is the best one that the WWE has put together. Only Wrestle Manias X-7, X-8, and Summer Slam 2000 even compare to this. The Macho Man-Steamboat match is the GREATEST MATCH of ALL TIME! Nothing before or since has compared to this match. The only exceptions are the King of the Ring 1998 Hell in the Cell Match between Mankind and The Undertaker and the three TLC matches. Hogan vs. Andre is a great match as well, especially when Hogan slams Andre. It's truly unbelievable! Jake the Snake vs. Honky Tonk Man is a very good, underrated match. The aftermatch chaos is great too! Roddy Piper vs. Adrian Adonis is another underrated match. The madness that ensues when Roddy goes wild and beats up Jimmy Hart and Adonis is classic. One of the best parts of the night. This is also the match where Brutus Beefcake becomes The Barber. British Bulldogs and Tito Santana vs. Hart Foundation and Danny Davis is a great match and the chaos at the end is classic, a model for the multi-wrestler mayhem that they use so often now days. Junkyard Dog vs. Harley Race. One of the best short matches in wrestling. Junkyard Dog attacking Race with a chair at the end is memorable. Can-Am Connection vs. Magnificant Moraco and Cowboy Bob Orton is a greta opening bout that ahs many exciting moments and gets the crowd on their feet and pumps them up for the matches later on the card. Hercules vs. Billy Jack Haynes is a slow brawl that ends on a countout, but the aftermatch madness is great. King Kong Bundy, Little Tokyo, and Lord Littlebrook vs. Hillbilly Jim, Little Beaver, and the Haiti Kid is kind of short, but it has one of the greatest moments in wrestling history in it when Bundy gets mad and bodyslams and elbowdrops Little Beaver. A classic moment to say the least. Koko B. Ware vs. The Natural Butch Reed is a semi-boring filler match, but at the end when Tito Santana comes out and roughs up Slick, it gets really exciting. The Rougau Brothers vs. Brutus Beefcake and Greg Valentine is a fair match that features Dino Bravo interfering, a great brawl, Beefacke getting leaving the Dream Team, and Bobby Heenan in the announce position. The Killer Bees vs. Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff is kind of a filler match before the Main Event, until Hacksaw Jim Duggan whacks the Sheik with his 2x4 in a great moment.",1032825600,,2325,4.564593301435407

Other highlights are the incomparable Hulk Hogan and Andre The Giant in pehaps *the biggest main event in wrestling history*. That is not hyperbole. If one were to start collecting videos of the *Sport Of Kings*, this would be a very good place to start.
Do yourself a favor and fast forward through Aretha Franklin. Don't miss the classic oft replayed soundbite by Vince McMahon preceding that: ""...and welcome to WrestleMania III!""

Match 1: The Can-Am Connection vs. Don Muraco & Bon Orton - with the body and the late Gorilla Monson on commentary they made the whole ppv enjoyable,  to the match. this is a good tag team match. the connection are Tom Zenk and a young Rick Martel. good solid match and a good finish.  Rating: ***
Match 2: Hercules vs. Billy Jack Haynes - even though this match has a bad finish its still a good solid one on one match here. Billy Jack is a good wrestler and this is his only wwf ppv apearence. Rating: **1/4
Match 3: Haitia Kid, Little Beaver, and Hillbilly Jim vs. Lord Littlebrook, Little Tokyo, and King Kong Bundy - man Bundy main evented wrestlemania last year and now he is in a comedy match. funny watchin the little people wrestle here and honestly i was sad to see it end Rating: **1/4
Match 4: Harley Race vs. Junkyard Dog - Race was king of the ring at this point and this is a bowing match in which the looser would have to bow....not really a good match. I love the late junkyard dog but he doesn't make that many good matches. anyways Race wins it with the belly to belly. Rating: *1/3
Match 5: The Dream Team vs. The Rougeaus - the dream team is Brutus Beefcake and Greg Valentine...good tag match, valentine turns on Beefcake here which makes the crowd happy b/c they like Beefcake Rating:**1/4
Match 6: Roddy Piper vs. Adrian Adonis - this is a hair vs. hair match and I have never really liked this match for some reason but I do like when they cut Adonis's hair Rating: *1/2
Match 7: Danny Davis & The Hart Foundation vs. Tito Santana & The British Bulldogs - The Dynamite Kid is awesome!!!!!!!! man did I hate Danny Davis and The Foundation here...good 6-man tag match here and a good finish to boot Rating: ***1/2
Match 8: Butch Reed vs. Koko B. Ware - Koko is the biggest jobber in wwf history! and nobody expected him to win....squash match here that lasts 3 min Rating: *
Match 9: IC Champion Randy Savage vs. Ricky Steamboat - Steamboat is god!!! and this is the match.........one of the greatests matches of all time!!!!!!!! I'm sure everybody would agree. Rating: *****

Wrestling of today can not even compare to wrestling in the 80's. At least it was wrestling. My other favorite match, was Roddy Piper vs Adrian Adonis.

However, watching the 1999 VHS re-release of a uncut PPV called WWF WrestleMania III is true experience because what you won't hear on WWE Network or WrestleMania Anthology sets are certain themes composed by record labels such as Ricky Steamboat's original theme (Siruis by Alan Parsons Project), Hillbilly Jim (Don't Go Messin' with a Country Boy) and the closing theme (Who's Zoomin Who by Aretha Franklin). Only on this release though, but WWE these days doesn't want to invest on paying royalties due to copyright.

In this VHS re-release, About the first 40 seconds of this PPV are missing, but it doesn't matter. Ricky Steamboat vs. Macho Man Randy Savage is one of my top 10 favorite matches of all time, and Hulk Hogan vs. Andre The Giant for the WWF Championship was a great main event that this PPV changed wrestling forever because Hulk Hogan's bodyslam on Andre The Giant is still one of the many signature moments of wrestling history.",1454889600,,996,4.757225433526012

7808873,5,6300278506,"Can-Am Connection VS ""Ace"" Bob Orton and Magnificient Muraco(with Mr. Fuji): This was a good way to start off the PPV. Not a bad little match with Can-Am winning in exciting fashion.

Hercules VS Billy Jack Haynes: The match was going pretty good for two men who weren't know for scientific wrestling. The bad part was the ending was a double count-out. The aftermath was awesome with Hercules busting Haynes opening after hitting him with his chains a few times. It might be the first time someone got colored at WrestleMania.

Hillbilly Jim, Little Beaver, and Haiti Kid VS King Kong Bundy, Lord Littlebrook, and Little Tokyo: I really didn't watch much of this match, even though it was kept short. Bundy and Jim was going fine but Bundy drops an elbow on a midget and gets disqualified.

JYD VS Harley Race: One reviewer said both men were past there prime but I disagree. This was anther short but exciting match with a weak finish. JYD hits Race with a chair after bowing to him.

Rogeau Brothers VS Dream Team: It's amazing to think of how many wreslters WWF employed in the 80's. This was a decent tag match with Dream Team winning in the end. Bravo and Valentine double team Beefcake after the match, causing the face turn.

Roddy Piper VS Adrian Adonis: People say Piper's best match was against Bret Hart. However, this is a close second. Piper delivers a perfect story thru out the match and did one helluva job selling it. Piper wins in the end and the new face, Beefcake, cuts Adrian's hair after.

British Bulldogs and Tito Santana VS Hart Foundation and Danny Davis: I can understand Davis from a story point. The match was good but not a classic. The ending was quick and chaotic.

Koko B Ware VS Butch Reed: Everything was going fine until this match. I cant really remember it too well but Reed wins it in the end. Santana attacks Slick after the match.

Randy Savage VS Ricky Steamboat for the IC title: Do I really need to review this match? One of the greatest matches in WrestleMania history and wrestling history. If your a wrestling fan and you've never viewed this match, you got a problem.

Jake Roberts (with Alice Cooper) VS Honky Tonk Man (with Jimmy Hart): Robert starts out strong and beats the holy hell out of Honky Tonk. The match was good with Honky Tonk winning via cheating. Again, the aftermatch was great.

Nikolai Volkoff and Iron Shiek VS Killer Bees: Jim Duggan interferes before the match. The match went down pretty good but Duggan interferes and Bees get disqualified, which is too bad.

Hulk Hogan VS Andre The Giant: The PPV sold this match hard. Is it a classic? Hardly. It was a typical Hogan match with him winning the world title once and for all, passing the torch to the Hulkster.

Overall, excellent PPV. The only bad match was Ware-Reed and I suppose Bees-Volkoff and Sheik was pretty pointless. Every match had a good story to go with it and most matches were kept under ten minutes. If you consider yourself a wrestling fan then you need to watch this. WWF was on there A-game here.",1284681600,,3040,4.578268876611418

No wm up to this point has came close to reaching the attendance record of 93,000 plus fans, Hogan vs Andre, Savage vs Steamboat and much more.  The whole card together wasn't great but still a solid show from start to finish.  Here's the card and my ratings.

***** = Classic; **** = Excellent; *** = Good; ** = Fair; * = Poor; DUD = skip

1.  Can Am Connection vs Muraco and Bob Orton
- Alot of people have given this 3 stars but I didn't think it was that good.  Muraco and Orton didn't do much here.  Can Am dominated about 90% of the match.  Can Am uses some great technicial wrestling and high flying action here.  Martel pins Muraco with a high cross body while his partner does a schoolboy trip from behind.

Rating: ** 1/2

2.  Billy Jack Hayes vs the late Hercules
- The battle of the full nelson.  Both guys use some good power moves.  Too bad it had to end in a lame double countout finish.  Solid performance both men.

Rating: ** 1/2

3.  King Kong Bundy w/ midgets vs Hillbilly Jim w/Midgets
- Short and boring.  The only exciting part of the match is when Bundy slams a midget and drops an elbow on him.

Rating: 1/4

4.  the late Junkyard Dog vs Harley Race
- Another really short match.  The only saving grace behind this match is Race doing some good selling for JYD.  Loved the part where JYD was laying on the outside of the ring and Race tried to do a flying headbutt but missed.  Race wins with a belly to belly suplex and JYD had to bow down to the king.

Rating: 1/2

5.  Rougeaus Brothers vs Dream Team (Valentine and Beefcake)
- Once again we had another really short match that had the potential of being a good match.  They manage to pack in some decent action.  Dino Bravo's outside interference helped the Dream Team win but Beefcake decides that it's time for him to do his own thing.

Rating: *

6. Rowdy Roddy Piper vs the late Adrion Adnois
- this was a hair vs hair match and Piper's last match (well we know that was a lie).  Lots of brawling and crazy selling by Adnois makes this a fun match to watch.  Adnois had a sleeper on Piper but release the hold which allowed Beefcake to interfere and Piper would seize the opportunity and put his sleeper on Adnois for the win.

Rating: **

7.  Tito Santana and Bulldogs vs Hart Foundation and Danny Davis
- Davis was responsible for his bias officiating by screwing Santana and Bulldogs out of their titles.  Match could've been better but the beatings Danny Davis received was very fun to watch.  Davis hits Davey Boy Smith with a megaphone for the win.

8.  Koko B. Ware vs Butch Reed
- Neither one of these men did anything in their careers.  Battle of the jobbers.  Reed wins when Koko went for a high cross body but Reed roll over and grabbed Koko's tights.

Rating: DUD

9.  Ricky Steamboat vs Randy Savage (IC title)
-  A match full of great technicial wrestling.  Match was fast paced with lots of close pinfalls and no restholds.  I can't call this the best match ever in WM history, but it definately is in the top 5.  Match ends when Savage tried to do to Steamboat what he did a month ago when he jumped off the top rope and rammed the ring bell
into Steamboat's throat, but George ""Animal"" Steele pushes Savage off.  Savage goes to slam Steamboat only to have it countered into a small package and Steamboat becomes the new IC champ.
It's very rare that you see a match where the competitors go at and have a fast paced match with be able to perform the moves accurately.  A must see.

Rating: *****

10.  Jake ""Snake"" Roberts vs Honky Tonk Man
- match was rather slow and there wasn't much wrestling involved.  Mostly just Jake throwing punches and Honky didn't look like he was trying.  Alice Cooper came out on behalf on Jake but Honky was able to cheat his way to victory.  Jimmy Hart gets a close up look of Diamian.

Rating: 1/2

11.  Killer Bees vs Nikolai Volkoff and Iron Sheik
- Another short but decent match.  Sheik and Volkoff were working over Jim Brunzell for the most of the match until Hacksaw Jim Duggan comes in and whacks Sheik in the back with the 2x4 for the DQ finish.
Could've been much better if it lasted longer.

Rating: ** 1/4

12.  Hulk Hogan vs the late Andre The Giant
- Okay the match was not a great wrestling match but it got it's point across.  The match is a classic for obvious reasons.  It was the first time in 15 years (or that's what they say), Andre ever lost a match and was ever bodyslammed. Amazing sight to see.  The fans were on the edge of their seat the whole way.

Rating: (for historical purposes) *****

In short, Wrestlemania 3 was not a great show because many of the matches were too short.  There isn't that many good matches to hold the event up but it still has some shining moments.  Their were 2 matches that will stand on in the minds of many wrestling fans.
Andre vs Hogan and Steamboat vs Savage were amazing matches to see.  Slight Recommendation",1113609600,,4976,4.2994594594594595
7808875,5,6300278506,"And I was there!  Along with 93,000 other fans in what was, at the time a new attendance record for an indoor event.  Let me tell you, if you've never been at the Pontiac Silverdome there's two things you need to know.  First, it's VERY loud and with that many fans it was absolutely deafening.  Second the Silverdome had no air conditioning.  Thank God it was early Spring and not Summer as it was Still pretty oppresive with all those people in one place.

Matches included:

1) Can-Am connection vs. Cowboy Bob Orton and The magnificent Muraco.  Good Solid Match.

2) Hercules Hernandex vs. Billy Jack Haynes in a crappy short match.

3) Hillbilly Jim teaming with 2 midgets against King Kong Bundy and two midgets in a hilarious mixed tag match with Bob Ufer doing color commentary.

4) The Junk Yard Dog agains Harley Race.  Includes the worst chair shot in history as JYD barely taps Race and knocks him out cold.

5) The Rougeau Brothers vs. Brutus beefcake and Greg the Hammer Valentine.  Another solid match.

6) Roddy Piper Vs. Adrian Adonis in Piper's ""retirement"" match.  Yeah Right.  Piper wins and Beefcake cuts Adonis' hair.  Fun match.

7) The British Bulldogs and Tito Santana vs. The Hart Foundation and Evil referee Danny Davis.

8) Koko B. Ware Vs. Butch Reed.  Basically a throwaway match.

9) Randy Savage vs. Ricky Steamboat for the Intercontinental title.  One of the greatest Wrestlemania matches of all time.  Two great workers at the peak of their careers.  Numerous two-counts and great action throughout.

10) Jake Roberts with Alice Cooper vs. The Honky Tonk Man.  Solid match again.

11) Iron Sheik & Nikolai Volkoff vs. the Killer B's.  hacksaw Jim Duggan ends the match by clubbing the Iron Sheik with his 2 x 4.

12) Hulk Hogan vs. Andre the Giant.  The most important match in Wrestlemania, maybe all of Wrestling history.  Not a great match technically since Andre was so old and couldn't move well, but momentous for Hogan's incredible feat of strength in a full body slam of Andre and retaining the WWF Title.

No other Wrestlemania has EVER come close to capturing the electricity that was in the Silverdome that day and Hogan's slam of Andre positively sends chills down your spine as the crowd erupts!  Fantastic in every way and historical to boot!",1110326400,,2290,4.743002544529262
7808876,5,6300278506,"Originating from the Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan, this 1987 rendition of Wrestlemania has stood the test of time as the best wrestling event ever produced for mass audiences. Despite its announcing crew repeatedly bragging about the supposed record crowd of 93,000 +, the WWF somehow put all of its classic elements of action, humor, and character development together flawlessly for a magical three-hour production.

Rating Scale: 1 (awful)- 10 (outstanding)

1. The Can-Am Connection vs. the Magnificient Muraco and ""Cowboy"" Bob Orton: The event gets off to a solid start as the Can-Ams salvage a routine match for a fast-paced finish.
Rating: 7.5 - 8

2. Hercules Hernandez w/ Bobby Heenan vs. Billy Jack Haynes: A pretty good battle is wasted by its double count-out finish.
Rating: 7.5

3. Hillbilly Jim, Little Beaver, & the Haiti Kid vs. King Kong Bundy, Little Tokyo, & Lord Littlebrook: A quick novelty match has some amusing highlights including Little Beaver & the Haiti Kid doing a double-team on the other midgets, with a ""little rowboat action,"" as Gorilla Monsoon described it.
Rating: 4

4. Junkyard Dog vs. Harley Race w/ Bobby Heenan & the Fabulous Moolah: Race does a few pratfalls, but he still wins, anyway. JYD, in turn, then crowns the ""King of Wrestling"" with a chair after bowing to him (per the pre-match stipulation).  The match is over in just a few minutes, as both wrestlers clearly  appeared past their prime.
Rating: 5.5

5. The Rougeau Brothers vs. the Dream Team w/ Dino Bravo & ""Luscious"" Johnny V: While the match is notable for setting up the ""face"" turn of Brutus Beefcake, it also leads to the new ""Dream Team"" combo of Greg Valentine and Dino Bravo.
Rating: 6.5

6. Roddy Piper vs. Adorable Adrian Adonis in a haircut match: Billed as his retirement match, Piper gives the audience a great going-away present by humiliating Adonis and Jimmy Hart in grand fashion with some last-minute help from Brutus Beefcake. Terrific pratfalls from Adonis and Hart!!!
Rating: 8.5

7. The British Bulldogs & Tito Santana vs. The Hart Foundation and Danny Davis: This is a solid six-man tag match well worth watching as the Bulldogs and Santana seek vengeance on Davis for his crooked refereeing. The Harts & Davis sneak away with the win.
Rating: 8.5

8. Koko B. Ware vs. Butch Reed w/ Slick: A quickly forgettable filler match (Reed wins) is salvaged only by Tito Santana going after Slick at the end.
Rating: 4.5

9. Ricky Steamboat w/ George ""The Animal"" Steele vs. champion Randy Savage w/ Ms. Elizabeth for the Intercontinental Title: These two guys give a superb effort in an awesome 15-minute action-packed match, which truly defined the event's historical importance in pro wrestling. Although Steamboat wins the championship, Savage proves why he would move on to the big prize a year later.
Rating: 10+

10. Jake Roberts w/ Alice Cooper vs. the Honky Tonky Man w/ Jimmy Hart: It's the big upset of the evening as Honky Tonk steals the win. With Alice Cooper at his side, Jake and his pet snake, Damian, get even with Jimmy Hart.
Rating: 8

11. The Killer Bees vs. the Iron Sheik & Nikolai Volkoff w/ Slick: A mostly dull match (DQ win for the villains) which is not really helped by the 2x4 swinging presence of newly arrived ""Hacksaw"" Jim Duggan.
Rating: 5

12. Andre the Giant w/ Bobby Heenan vs. champion Hulk Hogan for the WWF World Title: Although Andre clearly was not in good health in this historic match, he gives it his best effort, as the unforgettable ending will attest.  It's arguably the peak of Hulkamania!
Rating: 9.5 (for its entertainment value -- not the wrestling)

Of all the Wrestlemanias, buy this one if you can.",1098921600,10,3677,4.8203497615262325
7808877,5,6300278506,"THIS WAS THE GREATEST WRESTLEMANIA OF ALL TIME. HERE'S WHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS CLASSIC PPV'S CARD;

1. BOB ORTON, JR. & DON MURACO VS. RICK MARTEL & TOM ZENK

2. BILLY JACK HAYNES VS. HERCULES

A TIME FILLER MATCH. RATING; 2/5

3. KING KONG BUNDY, LORD LITTLEBROOK, & LITTLE TOKYO VS. HILLBILLY JIM, LITTLE BEAVER, & HAITI KID

ANOTHER TIME FILLER MATCH. THIS MATCH WOULD'VE BEEN BETTER IF IT WAS JUST A 1 ON 1 MATCH BETWEEN BUNDY AND JIM. THE MIDGETS RUINED THIS ONE. RATING; 1.5/5

4. JUNKYARD DOG VS. HARLEY RACE

AN OK MATCH. FORMER NWA WORLD CHAMPION HARLEY RACE WAS KNOWN AS THE KING YEARS BEFORE JERRY LAWLER GOT TO THE WWE. RATING; 3/5

5. JACQUES & RAYMOND ROUGEAU VS. BRUTUS BEEFCAKE & GREG VALENTINE

A PRETTY GOOD MATCH. RATING; 3.5/5

6. HAIR VS. HAIR MATCH

RODDY PIPER VS. ADRIAN ADONIS

A CLASSIC MATCH. THIS WAS SUPPOSEDLY PIPER'S LAST MATCH. BUT, IT WASN'T. RATING; 4/5

7. THE HART FOUNDATION [BRET & JIM] & DANNY DAVIS VS. THE BRITISH BULLDOGS [THE LATE GREAT DYNAMITE KID & THE LATE GREAT BRITISH BULLDOG] & TITO SANTANA

A GREAT 6 MAN TAG TEAM MATCH. IT'S A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO SEE AN EARLIER MATCH THAT INVOLVED BRET HART. RATING; 4.5/5

8. KOKO B. WARE VS. BUTCH REED

BORING. RATING; 1.5/5

9. FOR THE WWE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP

CHAMPION RANDY SAVAGE VS. RICKY STEAMBOAT

EVERYBODY REMEMBERS THIS ONE. THIS IS A BONAFIDE CLASSIC MATCH. HAS PLENTY OF GOOD IN RING ACTION, THE MOVES ARE ALL ACCURATE, AND THERE'S NEVER A DULL MOMENT IN THIS INSPIRING MATCH. ONE OF THE WWE'S ALL TIME GREATEST MATCHES. BEST MATCH OF THE NIGHT. RATING; A WELL EARNED 5/5

10. JAKE ''THE SNAKE'' ROBERTS VS. THE HONKY TONK MAN

A SO SO MATCH AT BEST. ALICE COOPER DOES APPEAR IN THIS PART OF THE EVENT. RATING; 2/5

11. THE IRON SHIEK & NIKOLAI VOLKOFF VS. THE KILLER BEES [BRIAN BLAIR & JIM BRUNZELL]

A SHORT BUT OK MATCH. RATING; 3/5

12. FOR THE WWE WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP

CHAMPION HULK HOGAN VS. ANDRE THE GIANT [R.I.P.]

THIS IS ANOTHER VERY MEMORABLE MATCH FROM THIS EVENT. HOGAN HAD FOUGHT ANDRE MANY TIMES BEFORE THIS, AND HE ALWAYS LOST. THIS TIME, HE WINS AND KEEPS THE WWE TITLE. IN THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED AFTER ANDRE BEAT HOGAN THE FOLLOWING YEAR FOR THE TITLE ON A FRIDAY EDITION OF SATURDAY NIGHT'S MAIN EVENT, NO WRESTLER EVER WAS ABLE TO EXCEED HOGAN'S 4 YEAR WWE TITLE REIGN. HOGAN IS MY FAVORITE WRESTLER OF ALL TIME. RATING; 5/5

AND THAT, WAS THE BEST WRESTLEMANIA OF ALL TIME. NO WRESTLEMANIA BEFORE OR AFTER IT WAS AS ENTERTAINING OR INNOVATIVE AS THIS ONE. THIS EVENT HAS THE RECORD FOR THE WORLD'S LARGEST INDOOR ARENA CROWD. AS SOON AS YOU SEE A COPY OF THIS EVENT, BUY IT. THIS REALLY NEEDS A DVD RELEASE, ESPECIALLY BEING THAT THIS TAPE WAS RECORDED IN EP, MEANING THAT THEY SACRIFICED QUALITY FOR LESS TAPE.",1092268800,,2944,4.566793893129771
