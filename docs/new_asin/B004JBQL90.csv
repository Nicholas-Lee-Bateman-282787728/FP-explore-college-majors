8431852,2,B004JBQL90,My Daughter loves the Hoopla Kidz Nursery Rhymes. We have been waiting for the video to be available and when we recieved it the formatting was not compatible in our home DVD player. Its encoded in PAL formatting which is not compatible in most USA DVD players. It will only play in your pc. I contacted Amazon and they attempted to contact the seller for the proper NTSC formatted disc for USA home DVD players but they sent us another copy still in the pal formatting. There is no contact info directly to the seller so I am not sure how I will obtain this great disc for my daugher to watch. Otherwise we love the production it is such a great trendy set of songs for kids these days.,1310688000,14,687,4.292307692307692
