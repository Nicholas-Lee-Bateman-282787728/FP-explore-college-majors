8531548,5,B008WMGQC4,"This is the only realistic resource I have been able to find for knee- and elbow-counters. Split into convenient menus, with easy-to-follow demonstrations and clear explanations.",1419292800,,178,5.884615384615385
8531549,1,B008WMGQC4,Don't waste youe money. Not very informative. There are better dvds on the market. This dvd is very disappointing. What a waste.,1360800000,,128,4.863636363636363
8531550,5,B008WMGQC4,"It may not be mind-blowing or ground breaking, but that isn't what makes Muay Thai such an effective style anyway. It takes hard work and a lot of practice. This DVD has a lot of great material and is well worth the $$$.",1355529600,7,220,4.1395348837209305
8531551,5,B008WMGQC4,"The DVD's are of high quality and are very professionally done. The counters are very intuitive and to be honest very basic, but that's going to depend on your current level of training. If I were to describe what these DVDs really consist of in a nutshell it would be ""counter attack the opening left by the initial attack"". So if you're new to playing the counter fighter--this will give you a wealth of information.",1355011200,6,418,4.586666666666667
8531552,5,B008WMGQC4,"I must initially point out that I am pleasantly surprised by the excellent quality of the production. I did not expect this from a DVD on Muay Thai.

The DVD provides a precise account of Muay-Thai defense and counters. It concentrates on counters against elbow, knee and clinch attacks and explains in depth the techniques that can be used and how these are carried out.

I very much like it that the fighters show everything in detail - first in motion, then in slowmo and then again fast. Not to forget the performance of the super athletes Saiyok, Kem and Nonsai!

I have learnt a great deal from this DVD and keep on looking at certain techniques before I test them in training. My comment: absolute purchase recommendation.",1348358400,6,729,4.6796875
