7381253,5,B0142G2NM0,"My DVD set arrived today.  I plays in my DVD player with no problems so was very happy that it is indeed the USA compatible region DVDs.  The colors on the screen are vivid and bright.  The sound is very good and once you get used to the Irish accent, the dialogue is clear.  I like that it is letterbox style on my tv screen so that it's not cutting off any of the sides.  I found this show online a few months ago and the more I watch it, the more I enjoy it so was very happy that the BBC finally released a version of the DVDs for the USA market.  Great funny Irish show with a variety of humor.  Some of the humor leans towards adult themes so uptight parents might not want to play this around young kids.",1446940800,63,711,3.964788732394366
7381254,5,B0142G2NM0,"Ever since I found this series on the internet I had to have it only up until now it was only available to play on region 2 dvd players, not in the USA.  As soon as it became available for sale in the USA I ordered it.  I can't tell you how much I have laughed and enjoyed this series. No matter how sad or down you are it just makes you forget your problems and troubles for a little while.",1446940800,29,391,3.814814814814815

Watching the first season, I thought they'll never be able to continually keep this hilarity going, but I've watched all three seasons now and I can't remember when I've laughed so hard.  I can hardly wait to share with my family and friends, it will be so much fun, watching them and I know we'll all be hysterical together.  I just hope we'll be able to get more of these done so they will work in the USA.",1446681600,50,453,4.244186046511628

Im not a fan of British shows, but this instantly became one of my all-time favorite shows.  Youve never seen anything quite like it on American TV:  the foul-mouthed matriarch, the very real kind of raunchy humor we share between friends, and the elaborate sight-gags.  The show itself is funny, but its star, comedian Brendan OCarroll, intentionally tries to break his co-stars, and all of the outtakes, flubs, and improvised moments (even the rowdy audience itself) make it into the final product!  I bought this sight unseen, and Im so happy I did; I haven't laughed out loud at a show like this in a long time.",1522972800,,727,4.6484375

7381367,4,B0142G2NM0,"Like a lot of Irish humor, Mrs. Brown's Boys is on the bawdy side and is recommended for adults only. One can tell a lot about the people by their humor and this series will pull you right into the middle of a modern rowdy Irish family. Irreverent, wether religious or secular, this series goes the whole nine yards. I've watched several segments twice and the second time is just as funny as the first. One word of caution, there are times you'll need an interpreter, mostly during the star's, Brendan O'Carroll, lines. I'd say I miss about half his quips because of the Irish accent.

7381462,5,B0142G2NM0,"We originally saw some clips of this series on the internet and hoped the regular episodes could live up to the short clips we had seen.

No worry there, this series is a laugh riot. It handles serious relationship issues between the members of a small working class family but this series is not afraid to laugh at everything and everyone to successfully mock social standards and class snobbery.

The cast is excellent and never better when the star breaks the third wall unexpectedly on them and leaves in the fluffs and mistakes we don't usually see. No pretense is given about this being filmed before a live audience. Don't be surprised if during the middle of a scene, Mrs. Brown walks off the set , around a wall to pick up her purse left in the kitchen. You just never know what will happen next.

There are a lot of episodes in this set and almost every one has a screamingly funny scene. How many shows can get you to laugh so hard, even when you watch the scene again?

Brendan O'Carroll is excellent playing the lead role with a wink. He takes full advantage of the fact he is playing a woman to add to the absurdity of some of the situations. Yet he does this while providing a fully imagined and sensitive portrayal of an older single mom trying to leap the family together.
 This series deserves a spot on the top ten list of British comedies.",1485648000,3,1359,4.42

7381479,4,B0142G2NM0,"Bought this having never seen it, very pleased with it. Lots of good, silly slapstick laughs with some funny family dynamics. Mrs. Brown is actually a man if you can't tell from the picture-the series creator and writer. Closest US show you could compare it to is Mama's family, but with definite British/Irish humor. Subtitles do help so you don't miss anything. The pilot is included and varies a bit-much better makeup and character development after that first attempt. I enjoyed every episode and special, this is a very entertaining adult oriented comedy (language not suitable for children). The cast seems to really enjoy each other and work well together-many are real family members. Great characters and performances from the cast with lots of running gags.",1483574400,,768,5.103174603174603

7381497,5,B0142G2NM0,"This is a fantastic series that will probably never come to USA television since censorship over here is so inconsistent.  Yes, it's racy and risque at times, but it's hilarious and a well-done show.  If you haven't read Brendan O'Carroll's books that this show is based upon, you owe it to yourself to get them and read them, too.

My wife and I have watched the 3 seasons and the xmas special so many times that you would expect us to be tired of it. You would be WRONG, I have never laughed so hard and so often in my life. The characters in this show are flawlessly performed by each and every cast member, the goofs that occur are left in, and the character of Agnes Brown interacts with the audience in such a way that you feel like you are seeing the show live. A word of caution, the language is somewhat raw and children should not be exposed to this series until they are old enough to appreciate the humor. I recommend this series very highly for adult audiences.",1475193600,,710,4.189781021897811

Most modern comedies give me a chuckle now and then, but that's about it.  By comparison, watching these DVDs, there have been many moments where my ribs ached and I started to get lightheaded from laughing so hard.

I do wish that the language wasn't so strong, as I'd love to share a few laughs with the kids.  But this is adult humor and it is NOT appropriate for children.  I have to admit that if Brendan O'Carroll stopped using the foul language the show would not be nearly as funny, as the F Bomb and other swear words are woven very tightly in with the delivery of the jokes.  So I guess it is what it is.  If you want a Britcom to watch with the kids, I'd recommend Mr. Bean.  Watch Mrs. Brown after the kids go to bed!",1461196800,,837,4.18125

I was at the verge of buying an ""open"" DVD player just to view when this set became available.

I would have bought immediately except my suspicion it would be the best Christmas gift regardless of reasonable price.  The suspicion was correct!

7381692,5,B0142G2NM0,"I'm not surprised everyone is giving a 5 star review! I am so happy to see 'Mrs. Brown's Boy's Complete Series' finally come out formatted for (region 1 for the U.S.A. and Canada.) Due to some of the language used, this is not a show for children but adults. It is the funniest situation comedy series I've ever seen. The Complete Series set has 8 DVD's. Series 1 has two DVD's and series 2 and 3 also each have 2 DVD's and the Christmas Specials are on 2 DVD's. For anyone who may have seen some of these episodes on the Internet and liked them you will be so satisfied with the quality of this set. Clear video and in Dolby Stereo. Brendan O'Carroll (Agnes Brown) and his family and friends have created a very comical series. For anyone who likes to laugh every time they see these episodes, you will want to watch them over and over. You will get to understand their Irish brogue. I highly recommend if you like to laugh, then purchase this set while they are still available!",1449705600,15,980,4.360655737704918
