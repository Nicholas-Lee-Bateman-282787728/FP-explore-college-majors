8381412,2,B002UP8WPI,"I bought this DVD recently.  Although the tap instructions, combos and routines are good, the quality of the DVD is very poor, like a ""boot leg"" copy, with very poor lighting, it's very dark.  Given the asking price for this item, I was expecting top rate quality as I would with any other DVD.  I also purchased another DVD produced by Rizzo and it had the same poor quality.",1277424000,2,376,4.420289855072464
