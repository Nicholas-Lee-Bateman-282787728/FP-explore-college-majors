Just to check that out, I played it on my computer. Sounds fine - sounds like a beach. The low frequency problem is gone. So it must be our TV.

It feels disjointed and awkward, and sometimes shows a city shoreline which feels really out of sync with the ocean sounds. It is fine if you use it strictly as noise while sleeping, or for closed eye meditation, but if I wanted that I would just use my sound machine and use way less power! I saw that it said images and not video in the description, but the other releases from this company are video, so I don't understand why this one is different. I also feel it is a little short. I suppose I will have to try and find another video to use during therapy sessions, and if someone were looking to use it for sleep, I think I would still rather recommend playing a soundtrack through a stereo rather than turning on your tv and streaming device to use this. But I do recommend trying some of the other videos from this company. I have not seen them all yet, but if this is the worst of the group, thats not bad at all!",1431734400,2,1054,4.2227722772277225
