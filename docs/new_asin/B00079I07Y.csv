Vault Assault
-Lupin seems to have found his stumbling block. How do you beat the world's smartest vault? No one can get in, you can't touch the floor, and even Zenigata's on top of things. This is going to be a hard heist and a long night

Snake Charmer
-Lupin is in love again, this time with a woman who has danger written all over her face. But tell that to him. Even with her having a list of dead beaus longer than the Mississippi can't deter this love sick monkey. But what's with the Crocodile Dundee lookalike who keeps popping up?

The Second Time Around Pt. 1 & 2
-The past comes back to haunt Lupin in this two-parter. When an old flame who had died in the arms of Lupin years ago is walking around perfectly fine, things start getting even stranger when zombies are involved and an old Nazi scientist is behind everything. Can Lupin find a happy ending in all this madness?

Emmanuel in Bangkok
-Immortality is up for grabs and Lupin is the tool that ladies are willing to kill each other to use. Fujiko on one side and Emmanuel on the other who want the secret of eternal life and are willing to kill the dapper dunce if he flops this one",1523923200,,1202,4.235807860262009

8046273,4,B00079I07Y,I loved this show based in the comic books of Monkey Punch. It follows the adventures of master thief Lupin the Third nephew of the French Arsene Lupin and his gang composed by Goemon Ishikawa a master samurai and Deitsuke Jigen a cold blooded gunman. Sometimes joins to the band Fujiko Mine a bussom beautiful lady expert in conning and also thieving. Where the most valuable or expensive treasure or antique is Lupin the Third and his gang trying to rob it. The Dvd has 5 episodes that are in order as they originally broadcasted with the preview and even the commercials break. The series are well translated and the voices of the dubbers are quite similar to original japanese. The only flaw in this Dvd is that the English subtitles are the translation of the Japanese version not the English dubbed version. Sound and picture quality are more than average. I will wait for next volume.,1142467200,,891,4.681528662420382

8046276,5,B00079I07Y,"The five episodes on this DVD are the final episodes of Season 4 of Lupin III Part II: The Red Jacket Series. What a great way to end a great season! The episodes on this DVD are (translated titles, but the ones on the DVD will be different):

48. Lupin Laughs While the Alarm Bell Rings
49. A Pretty Woman Has Venom
50. Lupin, Whom I Loved (Part 1)
51. Lupin, Whom I Loved (Part 2)
52. Emmanuelle Is an Angel's Whisper

Lots of excellent adventures on this volume. Episodes 50, 51, and 52 are exceptionally good, but episodes 48 and 49 are good as well. It's one of the better ones overall, but Vol. 11, which comes out on July 12, is even better. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys a good mix of action and comedy!",1106438400,4,730,4.170212765957447
