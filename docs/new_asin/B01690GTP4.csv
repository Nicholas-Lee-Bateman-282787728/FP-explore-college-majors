7464334,4,B01690GTP4,"I am usually critical of these types of gore and horror films, but this one I enjoyed.
No spoilers in my comments ---- Special effects were above average, Acting was really quite good, Plot was actually believable, Scenery was lovely, Gore level was acceptable, The few scenes of nudity actually fit in with the story line and were not just there for the sake of seeing a naked woman!

I rate it a 4 star overall for watchability and enjoyment - a pleasant surprise from some of the rubbish and total crap that is floating around these days!

Is it worth paying for? In my opinion - Yes...... I was happy to pay for it and enjoyed watching the movie! So there you are - take a chance on this one and you might just be pleasantly surprised!",1452902400,11,739,4.3478260869565215

7464338,4,B01690GTP4,"I will try not to spoil too much of the plot, although I am not sure how much that matters with this film. In the small Appalachian town of St. Illwater, Pennsylvania, just a stone's throw from Mildred's 24 hour diner, lives Esmerelda Winfield (Marina Sirtis in a role that screams for Dee Wallace) and her granddaughter Samantha (Bianca A. Santos- see DVD cover). Granny is the protector of the people from wolves, something she passes on to her Samantha to fulfill her destiny...like after she is killed by a wolf in the first scene. The zombie Red Riding Hood comes out of the grave to fight against shape-shifting werewolves because flame throwers and automatic weapons are useless against them...Apparently you need +5 red cloak armor and a +6 wolf sword.

This is an Asylum film, which should say it all. Low budget, bad acting, bad script, but somehow pop culturally entertaining as it mixes Zombies, Werewolves, and Little Red Riding Hood in a rather bad fashion making a statement about who are... or not. There were no vampires or Wookies. Hopefully they will combine this film with their Hansel and Gretal series (that explains why no Dee Wallace) to make a super bad, but entertaining film series...""Wolfnado"" anyone?  Dialogue includes bits and pieces of humor.

This film is not for everyone. Just for Asylum bad film fans.

7464340,2,B01690GTP4,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

As the old adage goes, some people just never learn.  I guess I deserve to be included in the unlearned category, because I keep giving Asylum films a chance.  And (surprise, surprise), I keep getting burned.  Despite the success of its SHARKNADO franchise and the hit TV show Z NATION, The Asylum cannot seem to replicate a winning formula for entertainment.  LITTLE DEAD ROTTING HOOD continues this tradition of non-excellence, and even though I really wanted to like it, Id really prefer to have the 90 minutes back I spent watching it.

The concept, or rather the concept that was pitched in the press release, has a lot of potential.  It said, Something sinister is lurking in the woods, and the residents of the small town nearby are falling victim to its bloodlust.  When the town sheriff discovers that the wolves inhabiting the nearby forest are getting more aggressive and even deadly, he soon uncovers a danger beyond his imagination.  THIS is the movie I wanted to seebut instead, I got something else.  The resulting product is an uninteresting film that makes no sense and offers little in entertainment value.

LITTLE DEAD ROTTING HOOD is actually shot well and does a good job of capturing the small-town atmosphere the script strives for.  The scenery is lush and beautiful, and the location on which the film is shot looks very nice.  Unfortunately, this is where the positives end.

The acting is very sub-par, even for veterans of the screen like Eric Balfour and Patrick Muldoon.  The dialogue is clunky, and therefore the cast delivers their lines as if angry or sometimes confused.

And speaking of confusing, that brings us to the storyline of LITTLE DEAD ROTTING HOOD.  The film tries to bring forth ideas and mesh them into a cohesive plot, but it failsbig time.  The story has huge holes in it, and nothing is explained.  Theres even a big twist towards the end that is surprising, yes, but also makes no sense.  I don't want to get into specifics for any of this in the event you decide to see this movie for yourself.

I wish I could say this movie is so bad that its good, but I would be lying if I did.  Other than a decent cinematography job, the film contains no other redeeming value.  As a result, I cannot recommend this one with a clear conscious.",1451952000,3,2357,4.640096618357488

7464342,5,B01690GTP4,"Little Dead Rotting Hood is an awesome action packed werewolf movie based on the comic and characters created by Buz Hasson, Ken Haeser, and Gabriel Campisi.

This is SUCH a fun movie, and I love it a whole lot. It's filled with tons of action and awesome werewolves. The movie is well written, well acted, and well directed. Bianca A. Santos gives a terrific performance in the film, and Marina Sirtis also has a small role in it. The actors all do a terrific job. You can also read the comic book at the menu screen on the DVD.

7464357,5,B01690GTP4,"This film reminds me a lot of a cross between Underworld and Resident Evil. You will recognize some stars in this movie like Eric Balfour, Marina Sirtis, and Patrick Muldoon. Small town life is usually quiet, serene, and crime free. Ideal for all people. Not in this town! The locals discover what they think to be signs of wild animals near their area but little do they know the true nature of their visitors. Wolves are the least of their worries! They soon come to find out that there are more dangerous things in the forest than wolves, especially near where they live. What appear to be animal attacks start happening and now they must do something about it. What they find is scary and horrific. This film is unrated but I would rate it MA17 for extreme violence, minor nudity, and cussing.

This one has a real story, real acting, real direction, real setups and payoffs.  If you're expecting a hundred million dollar movie, you won't find that here.  Instead, you'll find a low-budget movie with a lot of obvious talent that proves you can tell a believable story no matter the budget.  Even the ending had some of the best CGI efforts I've seen from anything on the SyFy Channel lately.

the action added in to the horror element makes this a very good watch.
Not for children, but good story and kept me guessing... who lives? who
dies? who's the ""badguy?"" Nice twist and well put together. Character
development and acting definitely on par. Hope there will be a sequel
because the possibilities for more development are surely in place,
Comics? Novels? Maybe a video game? Nice use of blood and gore and guts
(and sex) without taking it to the level of cheesiness. The kind of
movie I wish I could produce myself. New word comes out of this...

7464365,2,B01690GTP4,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

There are some movies made to present something new, something wonderful and enchanting when it comes to the world of horror. And then there are those that present something different and yet not so enticing as to make you want to watch them over and over again or to recommend them to others. LITTLE DEAD RIDING HOOD falls into that last category, perhaps not quite bad enough to be called terrible but nothing exceptional either.

The story revolves around a small town with a huge forest nearby that is protected by the Old Wolf Lady. Knowing her time is nearing an end she takes her granddaughter to the woods, kills and buries her and stakes her magical sword into the ground at her grave after which she dies. But the sword brings her granddaughter back to life in the form of a snarling, fang filled protector like herself, digging her way from her grave with no clue what happened.

Cut to the town sheriff (Eric Balfour) who is investigating the death of grandma. While doing so several incidents happen in town involving wolves that are attacking and killing people. With no clue what is going on he holds the State Police at bay while continuing his investigation into what is happening. Hes also dealing with the disappearance of the granddaughter with her boyfriend constantly asking what is going on.

Eventually we learn that a new leader for the wolves, perhaps a werewolf herself (?), is out there about to wreak havoc. Only the new Wolf Lady can take them on, looking more like a werewolf than her opponents. But is she up to the challenge?

Ive thought Eric Balfour was a better actor than most have given him credit for. The fact is he even makes his character here the best thing about this movie. And while its not a total piece of garbage it isn't quite Shakespeare either. It has its moments but feels too spread out and thin even at only 86 minutes long.

This low budget horror film may not have the charm that many so-bad-its-good films of the genre offer but it isn't quite the worst movie ever made. Unfortunately it comes out around the same time as HOWL, a much better low budget werewolf flick that is a must see. This one might make a good double feature with that setting up the better movie, but other than that it becomes a film to pass by or perhaps to watch if it pops up on late night or when the shelves are bare.",1454630400,2,2409,4.488584474885845

8735928,2,B01690GTP4,"The key to a great werewolf movie is the werewolf.  This movie drops the ball big time.  The evil werewolf is a giant CGI mess who looks like a hairless, diseased coyote walking upright.  Scenes involving this creature are so fake and distracting that we almost did not finish watching.  Utter failure.  Not scary.  A man in a suit would have been much better.

That said, the acting is surprisingly good for a low budget flick.  And the idea that these weird forest guardians exist to protect the forest is kind of interesting, but it's never fleshed out well.  They are made to look like zombie-werewolf Red Riding Hoods and we are supposed to assume what we want.  Well, that never works.  You have to explain your creatures to us.  What is their history?  Origin?  What are they?  Why are they?  This movie fails to explain anything.

There are a few memorable characters.  I wish the writing had matched these actors' enthusiasm and professionalism.

Overall, this is a flop which truly had potential.  Writing is key.  Especially in Horror.  This film just lost itself, got lazy.

Better werewolf movies you may not have seen yet:

1) Late Phases
2) Howl
3) Wer

Lower budgets, but incredible thrills.  Enjoy.",1484179200,3,1215,4.721153846153846
8735929,4,B01690GTP4,"I was flipping through Netflix, and saw that Eric Balfour was in this movie, since I have enjoyed everything Ive seen him in, I decided to give this one a watch. If you are afraid of dogs (that were supposed to be wolves), you will probably not like this one. For the most part, when they were attacking, it actually looked real. And when they showed their teeth and were snarling/growling, yea, that could freak someone out with a dog phobia.

The acting was pretty good, and the storyline was believable (for a horror movie). The gore was also decent, nothing really extravagant. The one part that I didn't feel was needed for the movie was to have the sheriffs kids come to town. Nothing much happened to them that added to the movie. They didn't get kidnapped or killed, and the one scene that involved the girl and a wolf, really didn't add anything.

When the monster wolf changed back to human, the transformation was pretty cool. You could see the multiple teats, which I don't really remember often seeing on other werewolf movies. If you enjoy werewolf movies, I would say to give this one a watch.",1481500800,,1108,4.562814070351759

8735931,3,B01690GTP4,"This is a werewolf movie that takes its time getting to the part where were actually convinced its about werewolves and not just wolves in general.  For some reason the filmmakers felt the need to be coy about that aspect, confirming it late in the movie.  Apparently, they could only afford a couple of morphing sequences so they had to use them sparingly, more or less at the same time.  I wasn't impressed.  It is The Asylum after all, and nothing says low-low-low budget like The Asylum.  Even so, they managed to attract the likes of Eric Balfour, Marina Sirtis, and two former soap stars Patrick Muldoon and Heather Tom.  The plot is a bit bizarre.  Grandma (Marina Sirtis) sets her granddaughter up to be killed by a werewolf so she can became the new guardian..........after granny buries her and bleeds over her grave!  Besides the iconic red hood, granny gives her a sword and absolutely no tips on what shes supposed to do, never mind how she is supposed to do it.  Poor Sheriff Adam (Balfour) knows something mighty peculiar is going on but he hasn't a clue.  He goes to Officer Victoria (Heather Tom) for her obvious expertise on wolves.  Theres gratuitous nudity, vulgar language, and a bit of blood.  More of any of that would have helped.

Eh, Ive seen worse.  But Ive seen a whole lot better!  Its entertaining enough, Im keeping it.",1478995200,4,1350,4.637130801687764
