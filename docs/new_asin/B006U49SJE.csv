5019625,5,B006U49SJE,"This movie was actually better than I thought.  Good actors, although T.O. sound like he as reading his lines.  But all in all I really enjoyed this movie. Hope there will be a sequel to see how all the friends are doing.",1334361600,3,221,4.238095238095238
5019626,1,B006U49SJE,Terrible acting in a completely improbable situation. Beautiful people in a one-dimensional movie that could have been great if it hadn't been written by someone who must assume the audience is filled with idiots. Simply put-terrible.,1334361600,3,234,5.527777777777778
5019627,3,B006U49SJE,"When rich guy Dennis dies, he leaves ""something"" in his will for his college friends if they all spend 5 days together in his house. We have seen these type of impracticable ""will"" movies before. The characters include a washed up rapper who still thinks he has a career, a film star who does direct to DVD movies, a porno director, a business man cheating on his wife, A male model, a couple of gold diggers, a women engaged to an athlete and a sports writer who still loves said woman. Ebony (Reagan Gomez-Preston) is the chief antagonist in this group of friends which you wonder how they ever put up with each other in the first place. Dennis was apparently the glue that held the group together. Meagan Good, which is billed as a star in the film has a minor role and is not part of the group.

The first 2 days they spend together, the acting and dialouge are horrible. If you can make it into day 3 the movie starts to get interesting, as if a new writer and cast were hired. Even TO did well. The problem is I couldn't connect with any of the characters, who were introduced late, so when things are supposed to get interesting, I was bored. Days 3 and 4 showed promise and gave us material for the climatic dinner at day 5 which returned to the terrible dialouge of earlier.

There was a feel good ending.

F-bomb, no sex, no nudity, sex talk.",1333843200,3,1352,4.31496062992126

5019633,3,B006U49SJE,Stacey Dash is great actor,1429488000,,26,4.4
5019634,5,B006U49SJE,This is a great movie. I had it recorded on my dvr but wanted my very own copy for my video library. I searched it thru my Prime Membership (Video) and purchased it for a very reasonable price.,1420329600,,193,4.105263157894737
5019635,3,B006U49SJE,"My main interest in this film was to see Terrell Owens and to see what he could do acting wise.  Of course, he could use improvement, but for what I think is his first time out, he was fair and better than the male lead (director?) in this film.  I am not sure how long it took to film, but it is not a quality film and it tries to substitute quality with a nice mansion and illusion of money.

This feature nice looking women, many washed up (Dash) and other known for being Hollywood hoes - and they dressed like it too!  There was also Tatyana Ali, who was in it at the start and the end only!  What was the point of her having been in this?  Most 'actors' were lame and horrible, but Jason Weaver helped save the film and make it watchable.  At least he was serious and had good timing!

In fact, the timing is the main problem with this film - it is off and messes any comedy up.  WHen the timing is bad, the bad acting makes it worse.  Now this is a hood film, so these things are to be expected, but come on.  It had it's moments in the middle end of the film, but it made no real connections to the character of the dead buddy.

Now, the director seems to have a vision of African-Americans to look half white, East Indian or anything but African type black.  If the leads were not half white, they looked like East Indians (still black, but different).  I guess these are the preferred looks for some (Ali looks good, but needs a new man!), but no need for this begging on film.

All in all, this is something to see to say that you saw it and it even hints of sequelS.  We will see...  They need a tighter writer and better director.",1420070400,,1643,4.084375

5019655,4,B006U49SJE,I actually liked the film. It had my attention throughout the entire thing. It reminded me of my high school years a few years ago with my friends. T.O. can't act his way out of a paper bag though.,1395100800,,197,4.076923076923077

5019660,2,B006U49SJE,Did not enjoy this film. Was very disappointed with the acting and I was excited to view it. A little too predictable.,1393459200,,118,4.409090909090909

5019662,3,B006U49SJE,Some of the actors were good but Megan Good was overacting and it really annoyed me. The pace of the film was a little disjointed and the plot was a little far fetched. You are probably better off choosing another movie.,1392595200,,220,4.390243902439025
5019663,5,B006U49SJE,Great to see all of  the African American Actors and Actresses!  The movie kept my attention and kept me wanting more!,1391040000,,118,4.571428571428571
5019664,3,B006U49SJE,"Featuring a cast of beautiful and familiar young, African-American Hollywood actors, this is predictable territory! College friends reunite at a funeral of a peer; will is read stipulating a get-together at the deceased's' digs. If all can stick it out, they'll be rewarded. You can almost predict the types of conflicts that arise; the secret grudges, etc. etc. etc. Absolutely implausible but entertaining as a good TV movie.  The only thing missing was a great music sound track. P.S. the casting of the nearly 50 year old Stacey Dash as a thirty-something continues to work, and as credits roll, you'll see many of the cast members were part of the production as well.",1391040000,,672,4.946902654867257
5019665,1,B006U49SJE,Lots of unnecessarily foul language.  I was unable to see the need for such offensive language on an almost constant basis.  I could not finish the movie.,1389484800,,154,4.666666666666667

5019669,4,B006U49SJE,"Remarkably, the story line was better than we'd anticipated.  Although it was a bit predictable, all in all - really cute movie with some life lessons thrown in for good measure.  I would recommend it for girl's or couple night.  It's light and funny in some places and definitely a conversation starter.",1386547200,,304,4.8076923076923075

5019672,3,B006U49SJE,"The movie was good. Great storyline.
The acting however was at times sub-par. Many of these actors are great in their own right. They seemed to be over-acting during parts of the movie though.",1382659200,,192,4.676470588235294
5019673,2,B006U49SJE,It's star studded and probably Stacey Dash's best work to date...although her bar isn't set high. I guess this movie is just fine if you don't have anything else to watch. I really didn't mind it.,1377561600,,196,4.472222222222222
5019674,2,B006U49SJE,Not the best and not the worst. Wouldn't watch it again. Lots of has-beens trying to be Hollywood. Hardly a realistic plot.,1377216000,,123,4.636363636363637

5019676,3,B006U49SJE,"I liked the concept.  I just think some of the actors were trying too hard.  But, the depiction of how friends behave when they have a chance to get together after their years in college or high school together.  I think we are all a little dysfunctional.",1374451200,,255,4.382978723404255

5019716,4,B006U49SJE,"I thought it was going to be another low budget flick with the usual black actors who don't even act on cue...to my surprise, it wasn't nearly that bad. It's not the greatest movie by far, but definitely a good movie to watch from home. I actually laughed and the characters were very modern. I was pleased. I'm surprised I haven't seen this on BET or something yet, it was a decent movie.",1355616000,,389,4.342465753424658
5019717,5,B006U49SJE,"I have wanted to see this movie because of the storyline and the favorable actors such as Stacey Dash (""Clueless""), Persia White (""Girlfriends""), Megan Good, Stacy Keibler (George Clooney's current girlfriend), Tatyana Ali, and others. It is dramatic but nice to see a bunch of friends reconnecting because of their attendance to a late friend's funeral and reception of money from the man's free will. I would like to see this movie again maybe on DVD.",1353974400,,453,4.973684210526316

5019722,5,B006U49SJE,This actually turned out to be a pretty good movie with a good storyline. I watched it because it was free from amazon prime but I would pay to have a copy.,1351555200,,156,3.90625

The characters in the movie was great but the movie needed a little more storyline.

5019724,4,B006U49SJE,"Admittedly I was bored one night and decided to rent this movie. When I first started watching I have to admit that I was regretting my purchase but since I had paid for it I was gonna force myself to sit through it. But after about 15-20 minutes I was totally into it. It's actually really funny! Reagan Gomez-Preston is HILARIOUS in this movie. She's the main reason I kept watching the movie because I couldn't wait to see what her character would say next! I know she's been around for a long time too but I honestly never realized she was such a good actress!

It was great to see so many familiar faces as well. I think the entire cast did a great job with the exception of T.O. I mean, really??? They couldn't have gotten ""Derwin"" in there to play the athlete?? ;) T.O. is no actor and that was clear...

Don't got into it (watching the film) expecting ""A-list"" and you'll be entertained. Is the movie over-the-top at times? Sure. Is it B-movie, cheesy and low budget? Sure. But that doesn't mean that the performances aren't great and that on some level the behinds-the-scenes folks aren't still capable professionals.

I liked the movie and for a few dollars I'd recommend it to anyone who has an interest in any of the cast members.",1348272000,2,1242,4.462555066079295
5019725,4,B006U49SJE,I received the package in a timely manner.. no problems.. my issue was that something was missing in this production.  I don't know what.. but it fell a little flat for me.. it was too predictable with a lot of unnecessary cursing that seemed to come from mouths of people who probably don't curse so it sounded... weird.  It was just off.  The people were all gorgeous and unrealistic looking.  The guys were nice to look at though.. especially Christian Keyes ;),1346976000,,464,4.621951219512195
5019726,4,B006U49SJE,I really enjoyed this money.  It made me reminisce about my college days and how I have not been in contact with many people.,1346544000,,125,4.208333333333333
5019727,2,B006U49SJE,"This was on prime instant today to watch for free- I got half way thru, had to pause for like 10 min and came back and it was stuck- I reset and found that I now have to rent it- very annoyed with Amazon that I couldn't even finish it....",1341878400,,238,3.78
5019728,5,B006U49SJE,"I loved the plot and the actors.  Of course it had its unrealistic and cheesy moments, but this was a thoroughly entertaining movie with a great cast.  Original plot although a bit predictable.  Definitely one that I would watch again.",1341619200,3,235,4.825
5019729,3,B006U49SJE,"This movie was okay. Nine college friends reunite after the death of their millionaire philanthropist friend, and to receive a six-figure inheritance, must all spend a week together at his mansion as part of a reunion. Old grudges are reunited, and past relationships and secrets brought to the surface.

The problem was there was too much stale dialogue, and most of the characters weren't fleshed out enough, or given enough backstory. The only three characters we really get any attention on is Jamal, the has-been rapper, Gary, the porn director, and Lisa, the fiance to an NBA star. And then instigator Ebony on the final night. Other characters, like Storm and Aaron, are just sort of there to stand in the background, and have very few lines. Even Terrell Owens' character of Jackson is treated as a 'more important' character, even when his reputation is portrayed as negative and unloyal to his woman.

Personally, I wish some characters had more lines and dialogue. I would've liked it if Stacy Keibler as Storm had more lines, as her being the half-White character made her stand out and people question why she would be in the group of Howard University alumni to begin with. The same with Ebony, as her bitterness and nasty attitude is never really explained much. Especially considering these are supposed to be her only friends. It's implied that she's jealous and self-loathing, and that her husband left her to be with another man, but that's as much as we get about Ebony.

Overall, the script was kinda weak, and the directing so-so, but the story had a lot of heart. It's worth renting for a dollar or two. It's a nice movie, but it has it's bumps along the way, so just don't expect greatness.

STACEY DASH  - Lisa: Uptight law student and fiance to Jackson.

TERRELL OWENS - Jackson: Storm's ex and disgraced NBA star, currently cheating on Lisa.

WESLEY JONATHAN  - Brett: Advertising executive in a failing marriage.

JASON WEAVER  - Gary: Adult movie director trying to go mainstream.

PERSIA WHITE  - Trenyce: B-movie actress suffering from depression.

REAGAN GOMEZ-PRESTON  - Ebony: Unemployed jaded b*tch, gold-digger and instigator.

CHRISTIAN KEYES  - Stylz: Effeminate and flamboyant male model. Is assumed to like men.

HOSEA CHANCHEZ  - Jamal: One-hit-wonder rap star of 1999.

STACY KEIBLER  - Storm Cruz: Half-Black fitness model and book author.

MEAGAN GOOD  - Miss Stevens: The will organizer.

KEITH ROBINSON  - Dennis: The late millionaire and glue that bonded the group together.",1341619200,,2576,4.962616822429907

Had very good actors in it so I thought it would have been much better.. but NOT SO MUCH!. I would not waste my money on it unless it was about .99 cause I truly wasted my money on this one. Too much of using the F word at some parts especially when they were all at the table... Just a bit much!.. but that is just my opinion.,1340582400,2,429,3.7252747252747254

5019736,2,B006U49SJE,"And I was... drunk that is. This was a 1-dimensional story with stereotypical characters. Too bad because the plot had potential. But, the characters had no depth. All they did was put each other down and put everyone's dirty laundry out on front street. People don't really talk to each other like that, not anyone I know anyway. If they did, there would be bloodshed! Like I said, it had potential but failed to deliver. I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because I was able to watch it to the end, and I liked most of the cast (great to see Tatyana Ali, Stacey Dash, Persia White, and Essence Atkins).
