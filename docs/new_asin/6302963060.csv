Suspenseful thriller with some good twists and a great cast. Looking for ""Michelle Phillips"" Products?",1392681600,,452,5.366197183098592
7832610,4,6302963060,"The plot is familiar, along the lines of ""Body Heat"" or ""Wild Things,"" in which a seemingly vulnerable (but oh so conniving) woman gets the last laugh on the men.  This is a film that is especially fun for San Diego residents because so many landmarks of America's Finest City are recognizable.

The unmistakable San Diego skyline featuring the green neon lights of the Westin (formerly Wyndham) Emerald hotel, the Crystal Pier Hotel which is a popular honeymoon locale, the Sporting Club at Aventine in La Jolla, Hodad's which (allegedly) has the best burgers on the West Coast, etc., all are familiar to San Diegans.  And the interior of Pacers, San Diego's finest exotic dance club, is familiar to Gentleman Club afficionados.

The cast consists mainly of the handsome and the beautiful TV nighttime soap opera stars (William Devane, Michelle Phillips, Catherine Oxenberg, Jack Coleman, Alan Thicke) as well as some familiar TV supporting cast (Patricia Clipper is adorable in her brief appearance as the sporting club assistant) and San Diego actors cast by Tina Real (including the unforgettable, portly Jack Angeles), plus a ""seen but not heard"" appearance by the lovely Miss Hawaiian Tropic Deprise Brescia.

Although this film is not quite Hitchcock or De Palma, it is a worthwhile 95 minutes of entertainment for those who savor the occasional steamy whodunnit.",1283644800,3,1370,5.125560538116592
7832611,2,6302963060,"This is one of ""those"" made-for-cable thrillers that seemed so popular during the '90s in which great 1940s film plots were ripped off, mixed with a bit of sex, and acted out by not quite a-list actors such as Andrew Stevens.
The plot of Rubdown, whilst a little bit implausible (washed up sports star becomes massuer and is lured into murderous plot with scheming wife of passive rich guy) is sufficiently complicated, and the cast, headed by the always interesting and rather sexy Michelle Phillips, is unusual to say the least: there's Phillips' former ""Knots Landing"" husband Bill Devane in a small but pivotal role, former ""Dynasty"" siblings Jack Coleman and Catherine Oxenberg playing lovers, and even that earnest father from ""Growing Pains"" Alan Thicke.
It's not exactly a sensational mystery film, but it is diverting and interesting, and the relationship between Phillips and Coleman is also unusual given that she is, dare I point out, quite a bit older than him, so I think it is brave (and applaudable) casting.",1064016000,,1024,4.994152046783626
