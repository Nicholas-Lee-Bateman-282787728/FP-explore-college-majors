8659908,5,B00KM65VTM,This vid was pretty cool and taught me several techniques that would have taken me a long time of trial and errors to figure out. Love his style and I can tell hes a cool cat. Im going to order another one of his videos.  He makes it look really easy and walks you through his work and colors step by step.,1521590400,,306,3.935483870967742
8659909,5,B00KM65VTM,"He is amazing and he explains so well every step in the creation of the painting, from the basis, color, values, till the finishing. Ii recommend this DVD to anybody who wants to explore painting techniques in abstracts paintings.",1462060800,,230,4.923076923076923
8659910,2,B00KM65VTM,"I am VERY disappointed in this video, although the artwork is absolutely amazing, as is his control of the brush.  I was expecting INSTRUCTION on how to use mediums, gels, different types of paints, brushes, etc..  There was none of this and I could have saved myself $$$$$$ and just watched the free youtube videos if I just wanted to watch him paint.  I did not want to watch him do a painting. I did not want to listen to lots of music.  And I did not want to get a VERY few bits of information.  I was planning to purchase the other two videos, but after reading the reviews, I can tell that I will be disappointed in the other two, as well.  I needed information, instruction and how-to and I did not get it.  The only reason I am giving this two stars is because the art is fabulous and I received it very quickly... otherwise, I would have given it zero stars (if I could) or 1 star for the lack of information in this video.  I couldn't wait to get it and watch it, and I was SO DISAPPOINTED.  Michael, perhaps you should describe the videos more accurately so buyers know exactly what they will be getting.  I kind-of feel cheated.  : (",1447718400,8,1145,4.2304147465437785
8659911,3,B00KM65VTM,"He is simply an amazing artist and makes it look so simple, although I thought I was buying a instructional video, there wasn't very much narration, mostly music. I was expecting Michael to show and tell some of his techniques and perhaps teach me how to become a better artist. Show more, talk more and you will have a better product that we all will love and enjoy.",1429401600,3,367,4.411764705882353
8659912,5,B00KM65VTM,"Michael's video was very informative, I learnt all sorts of technics, shading and mixing including using a medium that helps the acrylic paint flow smoothly and not dry out too quickly. He is a modern day genius. The video is produce amongst others in a pal system which suits all UK DVD players. I have no hesitation in recommending the DVD, it is well put together and it was lovely to hear Michaels voice  instead of watching him on u tube.",1429315200,7,443,4.469135802469136

8659914,5,B00KM65VTM,"Bought this as a gift for my other half - he had been watching Michael Lang on You Tube for some time and was inspired to start painting. After a few frustrating attempts, he gave up so I bought this dvd to help him on the right track.  Michael is very instructive and shows you on this dvd how to shade and highlight and how to mix the paints and how best to work them.  Very helpful dvd - 2 hours running time so lots of techniques shown in detail.  Arrived much sooner than anticipated which was great as I had ordered it for his birthday but had left it a bit late and thought it would arrive a couple of weeks after - it turned up in the post within a week so he could open it on time.  Would highly recommend Michael Lang.",1427068800,2,728,4.0
8659915,5,B00KM65VTM,Very easy to understand and interesting.,1420934400,,40,5.833333333333333
8659916,4,B00KM65VTM,"I liked his technique, but the making of the video was less than professional. Would I buy it knowing that, yes I would. I can still learn something from his dvd and that's all that matters to me.",1410912000,2,196,4.184210526315789
8659917,5,B00KM65VTM,"I recently received and viewed Michael Lang's DVD, Painting Techniques.  I was excited to know that he would be explaining his painting techniques of using washing and blending while demonstrating an Urban Painting.  He did a good job of explaining the use of an acrylic matte medium to create transparent washes and layering and blending to create an array of colors within the painting.  He first demonstrated how to create and use the acrylic wash on a small geometric drawing.  I found that very helpful because I was better able to understand what he was doing during the Urban Painting demonstration even though he was still explaining the process throughout the demonstration.  He also covers how the different colors and layering of the paint work with one another to create the 3D effect of the painting.  As I stated in my review of the 1st DVD, Michael explains his process in simple to understand terms.  I believe that novice to experiences artists will benefit the most from this DVD.  Highly recommended!",1401580800,13,1019,4.918128654970761
