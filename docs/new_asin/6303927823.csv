It was also the same way when CBS Fox Video put it out on VHS during the 80's. When I saw it on VHS cut and edited,I was turned off by it.

728483,1,6303927823,"Sorry but i'm going to get flamed for this. Spoilers ahead.

I am not a fan of this movie. Not a fan of the dub/audio. The audio sounded really muted at times and hard to understand. There's classic American bastardization of martial arts films via too lazy to call the character by his real name in this film. Not nearly as bad as the crap dub for Nine Demons. The plot is rather ridiculous. The film does have lots of action in it but at times is rather campy. Chiba's mannerisms is a bit silly. You would think as he's ""hulking"" up somebody would interrupt him but nah. They let him get in a full constipated breath session before they get their asses whooped. They also didn't really do much development on Dinsau. On the one hand they paint him as some ruthless bad ass mercenary. However, later on, they then try to portray him as some honorable mercenary. What is it exactly? When Chiba is tied up to a tree, Dinasu blatantly ""fake"" slices his ropes allowing him to escape. How in hell did the Female Yakuza boss not shoot Dinsau for the mess up? When the action is not too over the top I think its ok. The action choreography is more grounded in reality and is your typical block/punch/kick martial arts film without the need for excessive wirework. One action sequence that I particularly liked was when Chiba did a flip escape on a yakuza member in a sit down meeting for the original kidnapping of the oil tycoon's daughter. If you are expecting typical Japanese Action Club acrobatics, this is not the film for you. I tried to have an open mind watching this but it just didn't appeal to me.",1345420800,,1603,4.433898305084746
728484,5,6303927823,"Sonny Chiba as Terry Tsuguri is the biggest badass mofo in Asian exploitation cinema, even badder than Hanzo the Razor. Too bad this version is an edited and poor-quality transfer. Criterion needs to release this masterpiece in a deluxe edition. They could add a commentary track by that film scholar who did the commentary for their recent reissue of Seven Samurai or, if he's unavailable, the guy who did the commentary for the Sansho the Bailiff disc. Also, we need an in-depth documentary examining the creative origins and development of this artistic work.",1319500800,,562,5.053763440860215
728485,5,6303927823,"DO NOT watch this movie on Netflix, I know this has nothing to do with buying this DVD here, but many people use amazon just to see reviews for a movie they will watch elsewhere. Netflix edited out every broken bone or shot of gore in this movie. I didn't even realize the movie was edited until a part of the ending skipped extremely far, I came online to watch the same scene and it turns out he actually ripped the dudes throat out. All I saw was his hand. There are way gorier movies than this on netflix, why they choose to butcher a movie for no apparrant reason I do not know. I was thinking how could Quentin Tarantino like this movie so much, it sucks. But the whole time was because netflix duped me. Just passing on the word to those who browse amazon and look at reviews for movies they are considering watching. If you watch it on netflix you will be dissapointed. I reccommend buying it here instead.",1318809600,,914,4.289017341040463
728486,4,6303927823,I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to other customers. The movie brought back memories of the 70's action flicks.,1315526400,,122,4.857142857142857
728487,4,6303927823,"Sonny Chiba makes a stunning debut as anti-hero Terry Tsurugi in ""The Street Fighter"", about a sort of martial arts mercenary who self-hires himself to protect the heiress of an oil empire from the Yakuza after Terry declines an exorbitant proposal from them.

Though the plot is occasionally a bit loose and tends to go where it wants, like many other Japanese features, this Asian actioner makes up for it, firstly, with surprisingly rich characters. Chiba's character Terry is superficially what one would consider a ""bad guy"", making out with random women, gloating, and mistreating his friend from Singapore. But overall, he still is shown to have a small set of morals, and, though he'll cross the lines slightly, you know he still knows what's right and what's wrong, and he'll protect his client to the death. Other characters, such as Terry's Singapore buddy and a pair of siblings on Terry's trail throughout the movie, are also memorable and quite well-written. The villains, for the most part, though elaborate, are forgettable. Secondly, the infamous fights scenes. Though not as elaborate as, say, a Bruce Lee film, these fights are certainly more brutal. As far as I remember, Lee never ripped a man's meat n' veggies off or gouged his fingers through another dude's head. Even when the fights don't get ludicrously gruesome, they are still pretty brutal and a treat to watch; Chiba's ability is fantastic, though the fights suffer from the infamous ""one guy attacks the hero at a time"" deal. Regardless, despite a slightly loopy plot, this a cool film. If you haven't seen, see it now, or Terry will come for you.

NOTE: My review is based off New Line Cinema's uncensored, widescreen 1996 VHS, available here on Amazon. It's cheap, in good condition, and certainly the true uncut version. A better, surer deal than wading through the legions of bad, cut-up DVDs out there.",1288828800,,1889,4.937106918238993
728488,4,6303927823,"There just some movies that are only meant to be entertaining and no thought is required to watch them, this is one of those movies. The Street fighter has more blood than any film I've seen recently. Plot is a criminal hates the mob and doesn't want to work for them, they try to kill him, he goes to help the poeple the mob wanted him to kill, and he precedes to dismember anyone that dares cross him. In this movie teeth get knocked out, blood get punched out, eyes get gauged out, d*ck get ripped off and throat gets ripped out as well. You can see this is most over the top action movie ever created. You won't be bored.",1245024000,,625,4.1735537190082646
728489,5,6303927823,"This was just an amazing movie, one of the few kung fu movie stars i enjoy other than bruce lee. In this movie, he rips a dudes cock off. What more can you possibly want?",1244851200,,170,3.8857142857142857
728490,4,6303927823,"If you like Kung Fu movies with the whacky sound effects and over the top facial expressions, this is definately up your alley.

The star of this flick is a ""Ninja for Hire"" of sorts. In the beginning of the movie he is hired to save a dude from the hangman's noose. He does an ancient technique to slow the heart and and stop the breathing of the inmate. So when the criminal is about to be hung, he appears to have a heart attack. Now get this. The yare about to HANG this guy, but since they think he has a heart attack, they send him to the HOSPITAL!!! To cover this buffonnery, the warden simply says 'It is the code.""

Well the brother and sister that hired him to save their brother from the gallows, cannot pay him, so of course a fight breaks out. The sister is pretty hot and I only wish she did more high kicks. Unfortunatly the brother has bad timing. He attempts a leaping cobra front kick, but instead of hitting his target (his opponent's chest), he strikes the window and goes right through. Too bad they were at least 20 stories up.

This movie has a few scenes of people falling to their deaths with a nice, rich, red colored paint oozing from their heads.

This ninja man is bad to the bone and kills about 200 people in this movie. The only person he cannot beat is an overweight Karate teacher. The Ninja decides then that he wants to help a deceased billionaire's daughter. He decides to do this 'because I hate punks'.

So the rest of the movie is fighting, fighting, and a little more fighting. This movie follows the old school rules. If you are the hero and you are surrounded by 30 bad guys, they will only attack one at a time. It is best that way anyway. If you fought everybody at once, the camera could not concentrate on each victim. Who would want to miss a dude getting punched in the stomach so hard that a pint of creamed corn comes out of his mouth?? I thought it was a nice touch.

The ninja man has a sidekick, but he meets his doom on a motorcycle atthe hands of a bling swordsman.

The evil chick who masterminds the kidnapping plot is really hot, and likes to play Russian roulette on other people. She get's killed, but unfortunatly, she dies at the hands of the ninja behind an overturned couch, so we do not get to see her 'Death Howl'.

What I liked best about this flick is the dude's facial expressions. Half the movie is close-ups of his deep breathing and opened mouth scowls. There are also plenty of grunts, howls, and 'aaaauugghhhhssss'. His face is pretty talented and can twist and turn many different ways.",1180051200,,2562,4.322916666666667
728491,1,6303927823,"The Street Fighter is a great film but this DVD release is terrible. I was only able to watch about 10 minutes of it. In the 10 minutes, the dubbing went from normal (for a kung-fu flick anyways) to awful. Before I turned it off, the dubbing was so bad that when Chiba hit someone, you didn't hear a noise until 3-4 seconds after the fact. If you just like to listen to movies but not watch them then pick this one up.",1146960000,,418,4.048192771084337
728552,4,6303927823,"'The Street Fighter' isn't one of the classier or more elegant martial arts films, but it's a lotta fun.  The fight choreography obviously isn't as complicated or polished as you'd see in more modern films, or even some of the better films of the time, but it's still pretty cool.  That, and Chiba's gots real charisma and presence, and is a very solid (...)hero.  That's about all you need as far as character is concerned, in this sorta film.  This film was infamously violent at it's release, and while this is gonna fade a lot over 30 years, some of the violence here is pretty amusing and impressive.  I can imagine people falling out of there chairs while watching the (...) scene 30 years ago.  In fact, I could imagine that happening to me now, if I hadn't known about it before hand.  The vomit-punch is pretty nasty, too.  That, and it just generally has a level of intensity and brutality lacking from most kung-fu films. (Note the scene where Terry breaks one dude's arm three times, right in a row.  Painful stuff) The film does take a while to get going, as there is relatively little fighting in the first half of the film, but whaddya expect.  It can't all be fighting.  (And, some movies try to have too much fighting, which occasionally becomes more tedious and repetitious than just having everyone sit around.)  And if avoids the common pitfall of having the neverending 1 on 1 duel.  If two characters fight for more than 4 minutes, it's almost guaranteed to get boring.  Fortunately, Terrry usually has to fight groups of opponents, which is the real way to go.

Yeah, I'm done.  Very entertaining movie.

728553,3,6303927823,"When THE STREET FIGHTER was first released in the United States in 1976, no one had ever heard of its martial arts star, Sonny Chiba.  Comparisons with Bruce Lee were inevitable, but whereas Lee made his mark with rapid punches and kicks, Chiba made his with an odd mixture of deep breathing and straight-ahead jabs and eye-piercing pokes.  The plot is minimal: Chiba is a free-lance hired thug who is paid to spring another thug who is set for execution.  Chiba does this, but his employers refuse to pay off, with predicably bloody consequences for them. Instead, they offer him yet another deal to safeguard the pretty daughter of an industrialist.  At this point, the plot becomes a blurry mess in which cause and effect become locked in a closed loop.  I simply could not make sense out of who was doing what to whom.  About all that I was sure of was that Chiba, with his lust for blood, was one real bad dude who not only defeated his opponents but also maimed them.  Part of my problem, I think, was not due solely to an unintelligible script, but also to a sound track that muffled each word of dialogue that was the verbal equivalent of an equally muffled script.  The power of THE STREET FIGHTER is due only to the graphic mayhem sequences that show how Chiba's punching  bags spit out sugar cubes for teeth and tomato sauce for blood.  There was one truly innovative scene in which Chiba punches downward into some luckless opponent's skull so that the viewer is treated to an X-ray slide of that fist bashing its way into the cranium.  THE STREET FIGHTER was sufficiently different from its contemporaries in that it set a new standard for mayhem that Quentin Tarantino found bravura enough to later emulate in his homage to the chop-socky genre with KILL BILL.  A quarter century perspective between my first viewing of THE STREET FIGHTER and now suggests that this film is remarkable only in that it opened new pathways for what was even then the start of a slowly stagnating cycle of cinematic vengeance.",1066003200,9,2020,4.643258426966292
728554,5,6303927823,"Often confused with the 1994 martial arts video game movie starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, this martial arts cult classic was one of the first movies in cinematic history to earn an ""X"" rating because of violence. Chiba is kung-fu assassin, Terry Sugury, who is hired by the Yakuza for an extortion plot. Using a series of excessively graphic moves, Terry takes out all comers. If you enjoyed the early films of Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan, you will probably want to check out Chiba, who many consider to be their Japanese equivilent. This film was followed by three other sequels though none quite live up to the action in this one. This one is right up there with ""Enter The Dragon"" as one of the very best martial arts films of all-time.",1061856000,10,738,4.598484848484849

But they make the biggest and last mistake of their lives and the let Terry live. When he finds them he is pissed.

728556,5,6303927823,"Notorious for being an especially gory kung fu flick, THE STREET FIGHTER, by today's standard's, isn't to horrible gore-wise. It centers around a mean-sprited kung fu fighter who agrees to help protect a girl from mobsters after her inheritance. Chiba is clearly the Bruce Lee of Japan and this film, along with it's three sequels, is a milestone in the history of kung fu films.

728557,5,6303927823,"When I first heard of the Street Fighter I was skeptical. I saw this DVD and it was cool. It had Soony Chiba as a hired help named Terry Tsurugi. When Terry finds out that he was used by the Yakuza(Japanese Mafia), they try to stop him at all costs. Easier said than done, Terry kicks the living daylightrs out of every body that gets in his way even knoking out one guy's teeth,ripping out a guy's viocebox, and tearing off another guy's balls. To put it plainly Chiba is a more vicious Bruce Lee. The visions of him ripping his enemy's limbs off are cool. He teaches the Yakuza a lesson they won't sure forget. No gang can take on Terry and survive. Beat him if you can, survive if he lets you, which he rarely does. This is not for the weak of heart. Fans of Bruce Lee will surely become fans of Sonny Chiba.

728558,4,6303927823,"As far as I know, this was the first kung fu movie whose main character was a jerk, a far far FAR from admirable guy who used his martial arts to help out crime synidcates and other thugs. Terry Tsurugi is most loyal to whoever has the biggest bank account. The movie opens with him helping a guy break out of prison because he was hired by the guy's brother and sister. When Terry kills the brother and sells the sister into a prostution ring, the convict comes after him for revenge. There are lots of other plots twists as this crazy movie throws in basically everything but the kitchen sink. Some of the fight scenes are really dumb and cheesy, but what do you expect??? REALISM???

Sure, blood and guts aren't the only thing in a movie, but they are often used as a selling point for this one.  Asside from that, the story is good and the main character is interesting and rates very high on the cool-o-meter.  He truely is one bad mother ******.

But instead of going on about the merits of the film, I will instead review The Street Fighter as a DVD. The picture quality is amazingly clear considering the film is so cheaply priced. There's even a Japanese language track in addition to the competent English dub. However, the DVD Audio Set-up menu incorrectly refers to it as Chinese. Also, the Japanese voices do not sync with the mouth movements and there are no subtitles, so watching the film in its original language is a chore even for those who do understand Japanese. There are some other extras on the DVD which seem out of place and irrelevant, but they do add to the ""value"" of such a budget priced disc.

The plot of this film is typical to the martial arts genre.  Basically Chiba, who plays Terry, is caught up in a Mafia situation that allows him to do a lot of fighting.  What makes this film so much fun is how charismatic Chiba is.  His character is very dark and very much the antihero.  Director Shigehiro Ozawa does a fantanstic job conveying the action which makes the film that much more enjoyable.
When The Street Fighter was originally released in the United States it was given a ""X"" rating because of the graphic violent content.  Today some of the bloody deaths are still hard to watch.
