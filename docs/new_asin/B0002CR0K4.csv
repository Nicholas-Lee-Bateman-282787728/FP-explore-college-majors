2076332,5,B0002CR0K4,"I was a bit skeptical about a film with live lions and a bunch of British actors doing the voice-overs.  I was surprised at how well this A&E and BBC original film turned out!  It's witty, clever and entertaining, even for an adult like me.  Kate Winslet is truly enjoyable in the lead role.  I hope she does more voice-overs in the near future.",1098748800,10,345,4.34375
2076333,4,B0002CR0K4,"Not since ""Born Free"" has a movie given such breadth, such tension and hope.  We are privileged to following the breathless perils of Suki and Linus, a precocious pair of lion cubs as they continually get in trouble with every conceivable danger surrounding them- they encounter enough adventures to fuel a series!
As Suki grows, children learn to understand the process of their own development and the courage and curse of their own individuality.
Seamless digital compositing provides a fascinating portrayal that is fun and engaging for adults, and yet compelling and educational for children.
Boasting the vocal talents of Britain's finest personalities coupled with the majestic sweep of the African savannah, ""Pride"" will easily become a classic that parents will want to use to introduce their children to the beauty and drama of the wilder side of nature.",1088294400,9,864,5.215827338129497

2076345,4,B0002CR0K4,"This film encourages an interest in animals which may lead to compassion.  Also, it beats a lot of the other rubbish that's out on the market & tele.  Parents may decide whether it's suitable or not for their child(ren).",1272758400,,220,4.615384615384615
2076346,4,B0002CR0K4,"I happened across this DVD on Amazon and purchased it because it wasn't that expensive. I was actually thinking this was a nature documentary about lions when in fact it's a fictional based movie about a pride of Lions. In the movie the Lions talk, have feelings and there's...DRAMA!

Pride is quite entertaining and because all the footage is from previous nature documentaries it adds a funny twist to the movie because the action is real. There are few CGI smiles and CGI was used to make the mouths look like they talked, but other than that Pride is like a nature documentary with commentary by the lions themselves!!!

I was highly entertained by this movie. Plus, Sean Bean has such a wonderful voice. He absolutely made the movie for me!",1266192000,4,745,4.679389312977099
2076347,4,B0002CR0K4,"Pride is a wonderful BBC film about lions that live on the Pride.  They have english accents which makes it a little silly, and it's live action. They animate the mouths as people have done in the past in many other films.  It's about family, finding ones self, and survival.",1218672000,2,275,4.48
2076348,4,B0002CR0K4,"Set in picturesque Africa, ""Pride"" is an engrossing coming of age tale about three spunky lion cubs and their relationship with their pride.  The pride faces many dangers in the wild especially when a pair of marauding male lions invade their turf.

Majestically photographed, this movie intertwines footage of real lions, elephants, hyenas, etc. with sequences using domesticated animal ""stand-ins"" who can follow human direction. The amazing scenes of wild animals going about their business were recorded by the use of an ingenious ""mini"" camera on wheels which was operated by remote control.  Two mini-cameras were used, one disguised as a rock and one hidden under a pile of artificial elephant dung.

In the fascinating behind-the-scenes featurette included in this DVD, you see the wild animals pawing and sniffing the moving rock/camera and dung/camera when first introduced.  After awhile the animals' curiousity wears off and they relax and accept the camouflaged cameras as part of the natural landscape. The activities captured on film by the mini-cameras are so undisturbed and intimate that they feel voyeuristic. The viewer is drawn into the animals' consciousness.

The lions' nuanced voices are provided by a who's who of the British cinema which includes Dame Helen Mirren, Kate Winslet, Jim Broadbent, and other notable thespians.  The dialogue spoken by the lions is by turns dramatic or suprisingly witty depending upon the situation.  The action sequences are skillfully staged and quite suspenseful.  They get your adrenaline flowing.

""Pride"" is an unusual and satisfying production by the ever reliable BBC.  It is appropriate for viewing by older children and adults. Well done!",1171843200,6,1705,5.39622641509434
2076349,1,B0002CR0K4,"This film is awkward and bizarre.  How can I begin to rate it?  Okay, so the lions' mouths look like they're moving.  Fantastic that someone could film all this with real lions, and get them to stand in all the right places.  I'm sure the lion trainers did a great job, that it was hard to do this etc.  But as a film...It's more  as if someone taped their own bizarre commentary while they were watching a documentary.  Something about the way the voices are all coming from the same plane, as if the speakers are all standing right next to the microphone.  You don't get a sense of distance, either from the sound or the video.  I'm not a filmmaker, but it's lacking something visually--the visuals should help build the plot, and instead they are sort of window dressing.  There is very minimal music, which is odd, and seems to slow the pace considerably. The plot is a vehicle for trendy societal issues, and it doesn't match the visuals at all.  There doesn't seem to be any humor, and it desperately needs lightening up.  The lions are hard to tell apart.  Then, even though it's not rated and I found it in the children's section of the library, there's a lot of adult humor and even some anthropomorphic sexual situations.  A documentary on the life cycle of lions is one thing; sticking modern British/Hollywood cultural mores into the mix is another.  Who is the intended audience for this?  My complaint is not with the story so much as with the entire way in which it was brought to life on screen.  I think I have a new favorite all time worst movie.  Ugh!",1133222400,2,1570,4.46830985915493

8026177,5,B0002CR0K4,"This movie follows the lives of three cubs and their pride as they grow up and learn more about the world and themselves. It's live action with voice actors and CGI effects. I think it is a very cute movie, and it was enjoyable to watch. I've seen it several times now and I always get excited when someone wants to watch it with me.

The effects are a bit dated but I don't view that as a negative. The characters are endearing and the plot is interesting. All in all it's a very nice show that I would greatly recommend to everyone who enjoys animals and nature documentaries.",1473206400,,578,4.302752293577981
