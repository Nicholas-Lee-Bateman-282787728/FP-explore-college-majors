Yeah it was crass and yeah yeah maybe a bit over the top. I didn't go in thinking that I would be watching anything that remotely resembled Shakespeare. I won't give away any ""spoilers"" but will say this, to me it was funnier than Due Date and I got my money's worth and then some!!",1300060800,16,426,4.083333333333333
4345874,3,B004EPYZSA,"The Farrelly Brothers' new comedy, Hall Pass, is about grown men having trouble moving on and is made, without irony, by a pair of grown film-makers who also seem to be having trouble moving on.

In that way it resonated sharply with me: the ""roaring forties"" are a difficult time when unwelcome facts of life (viz., the weighty hunch that best bits of it have been and gone) become harder to disregard. A popular gambit is denial: we believe we've still got the mojo, if only we were allowed to let it out. Hall Pass's premise is a somewhat implausible calling of that particular bluff: alright boys: get it out of your system: you have a week to show you're still, er, cock of the walk. Cue the riotous fun which ensues, right?

You guessed it.

The film is about as diverting, and about as challenging, as you'd expect for a films of this sub-genre. Praise, I suppose, but faint enough to look like damnation. Then again, I don't usually go for frat-house comedies. I have no idea who does, really: but Hollywood keeps making them, so there must be some sort of natural constituency. (I can't believe it's purely the ""John Major"" middle ground of people at the video store who can't agree on anything better).

It is a difficult film because, in an oil and water moment, the Farellies have tried to meld frat-house and romantic comedies (by way, perhaps, of trying to prove they're growing up). If they get away with it, it is because Owen Wilson plays a likeable dad so well, but - again - faint praise.

Wilson's Rick has a mildly wandering eye of the sort possessed by all males of all ages, and no more: he would never dream of acting on it. In a funny, if contrived, set piece he is observed riffing on this with his buddy Fred (Jason Sudeikis) in excruciating fashion on CCTV in front of some po-faced friends. Rick's wife Maggie (Jenna Fischer) concludes, somewhat neurotically, that her marriage is on shaky grounds (patently, it isn't) and that a swift corrective is needed. Fully implausible, but it's a frat-com, so forgive it that. Upshot: Rick and Fred are granted the freedom from their marital vows for a week to get it out of their system (on the supposition they'll be fully incapable of doing anything of the sort).

Thus we swiftly move into a predictable middle act: they guys and their frat buddies congregate enthusiastically and, as fore-saged, talk biiiiig but take no action, hang out at steak houses, chug beer and play golf under the influence of Stephen Merchant's hash cookies (Merchant, as always, is funny: the golf scene otherwise isn't). From here, for the boys, it all goes down hill.

The girls, on the other hand, repair to Cape Cod with the kids and hook up with a minor-league baseball team and have dazzling flirtatious fun-in-the-sun. From there, for the girls, it gets ever more complicated. Like you didn't see that coming.

All this is so much hot air, and would be wholly unremarkable without sparkling characters or outrageous visual gags and comedic set pieces to provide punctuation. Of the former (outside Nicky Whelan's Aussie barista babe, Leigh) there are few; of the latter, as you'd expect from the Farrelly brothers, there are plenty, one or two of the quality of those in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/There-s-Something-About-Mary/dp/B0006GANPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">There's Something About Mary</a>&nbsp;(Wilson's rescue from a spa bath by two nude men being one, the unfortunate plight of a girl with an upset tummy, in a thong, who ""never vomits"" being another).

There are also some spectacular scatalogical mishits (if you'll excuse the visual pun): seeing a fat man taking a dump in a bunker on a golf course just lowers the tone: there wasn't even a golfing pun to leaven it.

It's an engaging enough film, I enjoyed it, certainly - but in targeting, as it does, incompatible audiences (those who like frat-coms and those who like rom-coms tend to be mutually exclusive) it runs a large danger of slipping without trace into the chasm between them

4345877,2,B004EPYZSA,"The Farrelly brothers hit a high point with Dumb and Dumber (which is kind of sad since that was their debut as filmmakers), but it seems like they've been on a downward spiral ever since. There's Something About Mary was probably more popular and there was a little bit of buzz surrounding Me, Myself, and Irene, but everything else the Farrelly brothers have done have either fallen under the radar or everyone has forgotten about for a good reason (i.e. Shallow Hal). So along comes Hall Pass, the first Farrelly brothers feature film in four years. The trailers and TV spots did seem to give the impression that the film would at least be fun and entertaining and the film turns out to be funnier than some may expect, but Hall Pass tends to come up a little short in its execution.

As you can probably guess, Hall Pass gets pretty over the top and raunchy at times. The Farrelly brothers have become notorious for that type of humor. So if getting high off of pot brownies and defecating on a golf course or trying to figure out what ""fake chow"" means doesn't sound like a good time to you, then Hall Pass probably isn't the type of movie you want to see. You'll probably be walking out around the time Rick wakes up in the jacuzzi at Leigh's gym or once you realize what ""Knight Rider"" refers to. The film also felt like it was trying too hard to get laughs the majority of the time. There would be this big elaborate scene where Rick and Fred would try to get laid and it would backfire, but it didn't feel genuinely funny. I found myself laughing at the way certain lines were said in the film and facial expressions more than anything else. The finale of the film also feels really anticlimactic. Events in the film escalate in ridiculousness as the film progresses. The Hangover made something like that work, but you at least had a naked, Korean guy in the trunk waiting to hit you in the head with a crowbar and make the rest of the film fairly unpredictable. Hall Pass tries to cram action, drama, sex, a car chase, and a heartfelt speech into its conclusion. It was like the Farrelly brothers wanted to add a little substance to an otherwise, run of the mill R-rated comedy, but decided to throw in everything they could think of instead of sticking it out and making that one comedy as strong as it could possibly be.

The cast is pretty decent. The chemistry between Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis is what's front and center the entire film. Watching their confidence slowly crumble as they realize picking up women isn't as easy as they remember is one of the key elements to the humor in the film. Christina Applegate is just as funny and is used just as much in Hall Pass that she was in Anchorman while The Office's Jenna Fischer doesn't seem to stray too far away from her Pam Beesly character. Steven Merchant's Gary is used sparingly in the film, but he has some pretty hilarious scenes that steal the show more often than not. His extra scene during the credits of the film is easily one of the highlights. It has all of the outrageous antics that just transpired in the film and then some condensed into about two minutes. The sad part is Gary's fantasy may have made a better movie. Richard Jenkins is probably the highlight of the cast though. He was such a straight shooter, businessman type in Step Brothers and assisted a vampire to feed in Let Me In. To see him go from characters like that to Coakley, a sex-hound who can get any woman he wants, is kind of incredible.

Hall Pass is more than a little disappointing overall. Its vulgar and outrageous humor will win over most who go to see it and, to be fair, it is funnier than expected. However, the film seems to try too hard to get laughs and insists on pushing the envelope far beyond its limits. Meanwhile, the rather action packed finale feels out of place and the last thing Rick says to Maggie makes the entire ""hall pass"" concept a waste of time. All in all, Hall Pass isn't completely terrible but it comes up short in actually being worthwhile.",1298592000,3,4039,4.462787550744249

4346189,1,B004EPYZSA,"This biopic of American heteronormativity was truly a macabre descent into the human psyche. Its deeply somber portrayal of two unhinged, middle-aged, suburban old-bros touches upon the darkest characteristics of the patriarchal sexual double standard. Christina Applegate shines as the unhappy sidekick to the protagonist's wife, and eventually finds a brief moment of sexual liberation, only to be squashed by sexist, ageist sentimentality. Jenna Fischer is the wife of the protagonist, and was ok too. For some reason Snow Patrol was name dropped as if that's a thing, while the soundtrack was clearly curated by a data analyst attuned to the blandest aspects of contemporary musical trends.

4346582,1,B004EPYZSA,"I just saw this movie lately for the first time.  Being a big fan of such Farrelly Brothers movies such as Outside Providence, There's Something About Mary, Dumb and Dumber, and Stuck on You as well as being a big fan of Owen Wilson too; I had really high hopes for this movie.  Unfortunately, those hopes were just never to be after sitting through this total trainwreck.

I hated the way this movie throws in characters in which it was too tough to sort out what their relationship with the 2 main characters were.  That British guy with the fancy house and his smokin' hot wife for one.  Who the h*** are these characters and what relationship did either of them have to Owen and Jason's characters?  It was just vague.  Why should the audience even give a crap about either one of these filler characters for that matter?  Also, who exactly is this Coakley guy?  Either guy's relationship with him was in no way clear at all.  Coakley is a super cool old man granted(played by an unrecognizable 90's stand up comic and actor Richard Jeni).  Also, why does Coakley dress like Rocky Balboa?

I hated how the movie suggested that if given a free pass to party heavy and to be allowed to cheat on their spouses this terrible movie suggested that the husbands/men would be clueless idiots in their endeavors whereas the wives/women would totally rock the lot with how much fun and relaxation they would indulge in.  That's just unfair!  I don't blame the men's guy buddy's finding them way too lame to hang with given that.  Did 2 of them have to be Larry Joe Campbell and that creepy English guy who played Lincoln on Boston Legal?  I can't stand those actors!!

Jason Sudeikis(Tv's Saturday Night Live, Tv's The Last Man on Earth, A Good Old Fashioned Orgy) was only unfunny because the script was ghastly.  He did try though.  Owen Wilson(Bottle Rocket, You, Me and Dupree, The Internship) not only had a ridiculous haircut but he just walked through the whole movie like a he had bad heartburn and he had the personality of feed bag through the whole movie.  I love this guy so for Owen to put absolutely no effort, no energy, and definitely none of his usual in your face charisma into his part was just disgraceful.  Chistina Applegate(Tv's Married With Children, Prince Charming, Just Visiting, Tv's Samantha Who?) is hot and beautiful as always, her acting was decent, but she wasn't given much to do.  Her character does have an annoying neurotic side though.  Jenna Fischer(Tv's The Office) proved sexy but not as beautiful as she would normally be.  She was just annoying all around and way too whiny.

The scenes in this turkey are often times way too slow with very little(if anything) going on.  Especially those scenes where the guys totally fail to have any fun.  I thought those scenes would never end.  Of course this film also resort in gross out jokes as well.  One of which was much funnier in Bad Grandpa than in this movie.

That scene where Owen and Jason went out of their ways to totally bash the English guy and his hot wife proved too rushed, too obnoxious, and not especially funny.  To be fair though it was the only scene where Owen wakes from his coma and tries to deliver some semblance of humor.

This movie was chock full of way too many filler and forgettable characters.  I have already mentioned the ones that are notable in that category.

Most of all I totally despise the way that this movie found it necessary to preach at the audience about fidelity in a marriage.  For a movie that's about two married guys getting one chance to fool around on their wives and vice versa, the whole fidelity thing is one impossibly bitter pill to swallow.

Overall, if you want a funny movie that hits all the right cords, has frequent and good comedic timing, Owen Wilson's charm, energy, and likability, jokes that make sense, a consistent plot that knows where it's going, extra characters that actually contribute something to the movie, quotable lines, more than a little bit of nudity, that has original humor, and likable characters.  Well then you are better off looking elsewhere because this movie completely fails on all of those levels to say nothing of being completely forgettable and duller than dishwater.  If you want a good comedy with Owen Wilson I recommend Bottle Rocket, The Internship, You, Me, and Dupree, Zoolander, and Shanghai Noon and Shanghai Knights, all are a few better examples of Owen's charm, energy, and comedic talent.  Plus they're all a far cry more funny than this total trainwreck.",1471824000,,4548,4.672955974842767

4346719,2,B004EPYZSA,"Thanks to this film, the term, ""Hall Pass"", became part of the modern urban vernacular, and while the term was a big success, the movie was not. For some reason, Hollywood film makers continue to think that Owen Wilson is funny, and maybe he is, but personally, I don't see it. I usually just wind up feeling sorry for whatever loser character he's portraying. In this film, Wilson and Jason Sudeikis play two guys who have been married awhile, and are starting to get bored. After seeing mutual friends of theirs divorce, the couples worry that they're headed down the same path. Thanks to some friendly advice from Joy Behar, the wives decide that the men should get a week off from marriage to do what they want, and the rest of the film, follows their antics in trying to pick up women after being out of the game for such a long time. The premise of the film isn't terrible and usually, Jason Sudeikis is pretty funny, but Hall Pass falls flat on it's face. This is supposed to be a comedy, so why does it take nearly an hour for the story to get to the point? By the time the guys are shopping for dates, I was bored and pretty much done with this film. In the second hour, the film does get a little better, but not nearly enough. Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis are just two very different types of comedic actors and their styles didn't mesh well at all. If anything their antics together were more stupid than funny, and if there's one thing I can't stand when it comes to comedy, it's stupidity that leads nowhere. It was a good idea, but the writing wasn't very good, the actors didn't mesh, and the situations just weren't that extreme or funny.

4347373,2,B004EPYZSA,"The Farrelly brothers, Peter and Bobby, started out strong with ""Dumb & Dumber"" in 1995, continued on a mildly humorous track with ""Kingpin"" in 1996, and hit a home run with ""There's Something About Mary"" in 1998.  Then something not so funny happened.  Their comedies weren't so funny anymore.  Think of ""Osmosis Jones,"" ""Shallow Hal,"" or their execrable remake of ""The Heartbreak Kid.""  With 2011's ""Hall Pass,"" their old brand of outrageous whimsy no longer seemed to pack much punch, the movie looking and sounding more like a raunchy, worn-out television sitcom than a Farrelly product.

In this one, Mr. Nice Guy himself, Owen Wilson, stars as Rick Mills, a good, upstanding family man, a Realtor with a beautiful wife and three young children.  Life is good.  Except that after some years of marriage, he's feeling the itch.  The itch to be free, to date other women.  At least, that's the feeling he has, not that he has ever acted upon that urge.  Instead, he does what most guys do:  He fantasizes and jokes with his buddies about sex and other women.  Of course, this is a comedy, and an R-rated one at that, so the Farrellys have to give us some exaggeration.  Rick and his best friend Fred (Jason Suderkis), therefore, appear obsessed with sex whenever they're together.  That's all they think about, all they talk about, every minute, as they ogle girls nonstop wherever they are.  At least, it's what they do when their wives aren't looking.

When their wives (Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate) do find out how preoccupied their husbands are with their sexual fantasies, they decide to give them the deal of their lives:  a week off of marriage to cat around all they want, to get it out of their systems, so to speak.  The wives give them a ""hall pass.""

OK, that's the premise and the set up, and you can easily guess what's going to happen next, especially with the aforementioned Mr. Nice Guy Owen Wilson as the principal player.  With their buddies in tow to watch, Rick and Fred plan to ""reel in the babes,"" as they say, but they've been out of circulation since college and have no idea how to pick up girls anymore.  Nor do they know where to find women their own age (after all, they're in their late thirties, early forties).  Their idea of a pickup joint is the local Applebee's, and the best alternatives they can think of when that doesn't work out are the local Olive Garden and Chili's.  Yeah, they've been out of circulation a long time, and it doesn't help that they're acting like idiots.  Meanwhile, as the guys are striking out, the wives, on their own, find more action than they do.

Basically, the plot and characters comprise the kind of sleazy material that begs for Charlie Sheen in the lead.  Much of it is simply embarrassingly bad, the guys behaving in a ridiculously juvenile manner and the movie turning sentimental and corny at the end.  It's ironic that the Farrellys originally popularized this sort of sexy romp with ""There's Something About Mary,"" and now it seems as though everyone does it better than they do, particularly since the advent of the Judd Apatow era.

Remember, as I said, Rick and Fred and their friends are in their late thirties, early forties, yet they still engage in poo jokes, masturbation jokes, body-parts jokes, pot jokes, and the like.  It's as though the Farrellys had never gotten out of college themselves.  Or high school, the humor is so infantile.

""Hall Pass"" makes one wonder if it isn't an example of the dumbing down of America.  Or is the movie a part of the cause of the dumbing down?  Let me put it this way:  The funniest character in ""Hall Pass"" is Richard Jenkins as an unlikely swinger, and the funniest parts of the action come during the closing credits.  Even the deleted scene is funnier than anything in the film itself.

As a final nail in the coffin, the whole movie reminded me of a childishly updated version of Billy Wilder's ""The Seven Year Itch,"" the old 1955 film that was sexier through innuendo and funnier all the way around.  Of course, it had Marilyn Monroe in it, so maybe I'm making an unfair comparison.

Video:
New Line video engineers use a single-layer BD25 and MPEG-4/AVC encoding to transfer the film to Blu-ray in its original aspect ratio, 2.40:1.  The results look compressed, the picture very bright, very glossy, and too often very warm and fuzzy.  Definition varies, bouncing back and forth between reasonably sharp and fairly soft.  Colors are rich, to be sure, but they frequently appear too intense, especially skin tones, which make almost everyone look deeply tanned or severely sunburned.

Audio:
There are times when it seems like using lossless sound is a waste of a good thing.  This is one of those times, the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 hardly impressive.  There is a decent stereo spread, the midrange is clean, and the backgrounds are quiet, which is about the size of it.  Otherwise, the soundtrack is mostly just loud, with very little activity in the side or rear channels, a limited frequency response, and a restricted dynamic range.  The music, taken from a variety of commercial pop recordings, puts only a touch of ambient bloom into the surrounds.

Extras:
Disc one of this two-disc, ""Enlarged Edition"" Blu-ray Combo package contains two high-definition versions of the movie, the theatrical cut (105 minutes) and an extended cut (111 minutes), with footage never seen in a theater.  In addition, it includes two Blu-ray exclusives:  an additional, four-minute scene that's cuter than anything in the movie and a two-minute gag reel.  The extras conclude with a mere eleven scene selections; promos at start-up; BD-Live access; English, French, and Spanish spoken languages on the theatrical version; English as the only spoken language on the extended cut; French and Spanish subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Disc two contains a standard-definition version of the movie on DVD and an SD digital copy (the offer expiring June 12, 2012.)  A cardboard slipcover encloses the flimsy Blu-ray Eco-case.

Parting Shots:
If the Farrelly brothers had made this film ten, fifteen years ago, it might have seemed a little more risqu or even original.  Today, ""Hall Pass"" just seems old and tired, about as old and tired as its characters, trying their best to cut loose but unable to overcome their own middle-class limitations.  Owen Wilson, as always, portrays a likeable guy, but ""Saturday Night Live's"" Jason Sudeikis provides little support as his smarmy best friend.  ""Hall Pass"" deserves a pass.",1433548800,,6568,4.836021505376344

4347640,4,B004EPYZSA,"I think the Farrelly Brothers are somewhat misunderstood.

I actually saw ""Hall Pass"" a couple of years ago.  It was either free on HBO or I rented it.  I don't remember.

What I DO remember, is that it was a rather bland movie, until the scene at the gym, when Owen Wilson was in the men's locker room, sitting in the spa, which was at floor level.

He got stuck on the intake valve, and started to panic.  I think he called out for help................................

Two guys that were in a ""state of complete undress"" rescued him.

Because the spa was floor level, the scene was shot so all the audience saw of the rescuers, was from a few inches above the waist, downward............................

I've seen several Farrelly Brothers movies.  My birthday is at a difficult time of year for a party, so what I started doing, was requiring friends and family to attend a matinee, of the most ridiculous comedy in theaters at the time, and afterward, we all go to lunch.

We've seen ""Dumb and Dumber"", ""Ace Ventura"", etc.  You get the picture.

One year, there were ten of us............, including my best friend of 45 years, my 89 year old mother, sister, erudite brother-in-law, etc.

There is genius in this practice.  Since I never get an actual party, I at least get the pleasure of subjecting my loved ones to sophomoric, gross-out humor for 2 hours!  I overheard my above mentioned ""best friend"", tell another guest, while we were all leaving the theater after ""Ace........""  ""I actually gagged...................""

I also got to see my BIL, who likes to think of himself as someone who wouldn't be caught dead at a movie in this ""genre"", not able to keep himself from laughing at gags in ""Dumb and Dumber"".  I was in HEAVEN!

But the really great part, is that if I don't get an actual party, it is at least an activity, and nobody has to feel uncomfortable if they didn't like it.  THESE movies, the group is blasting before they leave their seats!

At ""Dumb and Dumber"", my mom was sitting about 4 guests away from me in my row.

During the infamous, protracted, diarrhea scene, I bent over to see her reaction, and she had her head down, with her fingers in her ears.

After the movie, I asked her if she was okay.  She said, ""Oh, yes.""  ""I was just afraid I was going to have an accident.""  She actually thought some of it was very funny.

But I digress.  ""Hall Pass"" just seemed like a ""white bread"" comedy, until the gym scene, and the view of the two rescuers, included ""full frontal nudity"" and a very good look at two VERY large, semi-erect penises.

In an INSTANT, I knew it HAD to be a Farrelly Brother's movie!  I wouldn't put it past those two, to purposely write a boring comedy, possibly leave their names off the opening credits........., just so they could lull the audience into a catatonic state, then WHAM, wake 'em up with two of the biggest units I've ever seen, and KNOW that loyal fans would recognize their ""signature"" anywhere!  NOBODY else could EVER beat them in utterly tasteless humor!",1414972800,,3031,4.565862708719852

This is one of those movies that I could literally watch every week without getting tired of it.  There is some gross out stuff in here but it is more than tempered by some sweet and mature underpinnings.  Maybe you have to be an older (and married) guy or gal to fully appreciate the humor where this one treads, so it won't necessarily crack up the youngsters who haven't experienced kids, marriage, and the secret desires that are better left in the fantasy bin.  Owen Wilson and Jason Sudekis make great sidekicks and the ladies are well cast and quite lovely.  I could do without the full frontal male nudity which will make most men writhe uncomfortably and feel inadequate in this case -- unless it is reciprocated with a female -- but alas not to be!

In Europe they would laugh at the pathetically weak men--but in Europe a president has a model ""girlfriend"" and a wife and the people view his personal life as his own business.  So we have a way to go regarding that level of maturity--if that is what you would call it.  HOWEVER, so much of this is true regarding marriage--the desirable people we marry become--the same old, same old--and you never see movies about a successful balance of sexuality/ passion friendship and commitment in a long term marriage--but when it work it is the very best of what relationships can be.  Schmaltz, that we actually LOVE our lives, sad that being men means we WANT to have sex with them and they seem to lose interest...strangely sad.",1390780800,,843,4.7465753424657535

4348207,4,B004EPYZSA,"This movie is about two restless suburban dads (Rick and Fred - Rick played by Owen Wilson, Fred played by Jason Sedeikis) who are granted one week off from their long-term marriages to do ""whatever they want"".  Their wives grant them this ""hall pass"" after getting fed up with all their ""girl ogling"" and endless focus on sex, sex, sex.

The idea is, take a week off from marriage, and get it all out of your system, guys!

That's a good set-up for a movie if ever I heard one.

We can kind of guess what follows.  The guys suddenly lose their bravado, and end up eating a huge meal at Applebees instead of cruising for chicks.  Then more ""fails"" follow - bad pick-up lines - a ridiculous segment with hash brownies - girls with ""stomach problems"" - a jealous boyfriend with a crowbar - etc....until they realize the single life isn't what it's cracked up to be!  No surprise there...we could have predicted this would happen.

Meanwhile, the wives, who have gone to stay at a relative's home, are having the time of their lives.  Fred's wife (Christina Applegate) is flirting with a hot young college guy, and Rick's wife (Jenna Fischer) is spending time with a very attentive baseball coach.

For awhile, we think Rick is going to get busy with a sexy coffee barista....I won't give any spoilers here about what transpires (or doesn't transpire) with that particular plot....

All in all, this is an entertaining movie to watch.  You always wonder, what's going to happen next?  Yes, the movie is made by The Farrelly Brothers, so naturally it contains some ""gross out jokes"".  Some viewers may be offended.  Of course this movie is NOT for young children - that should be obvious from the theme.  However, I would recommend watching ""Hall Pass"" at least once....you may not want to buy this movie, but I am not afraid to admit that I enjoyed it.

As a married woman, I thought I might be MORE offended by the plot....but I wasn't.  If anything, the movie makes the ladies look much better than the guys!  Yes, the movie is a bit clich....and yes, it can be a bit sophomoric....and it's certainly not very deep or psychological or anything like that.  But so what?  It's entertaining and humorous in parts...and delivers a nice ending that leaves you feeling pretty good.  So...what's wrong with that?  Watch it!  (But rent first).",1379548800,,2334,4.65036674816626

4348340,1,B004EPYZSA,"For about 40 years now, we have seen lame ""comedies"" about emasculated, clueless men in counterpoint
with ""level headed"",""more mature"", ""More qualified to be head of household "" ""manage the money and the bedroom"" = sexually dysfunctional/eunuch/frigid females.
And this is helping us ...how? Establish men as bumbling inept, chronically erect baboons, and this is supposed to make us laugh til it hurts?
Simple fact, females are ""receptive to sex"" around ovulation. That's it. They are covninced that they  have utterly no obligation to their husbands ongoing, almost daily need for sex. And so...these men find someone with whom to have sex...and the marriage dissovles, children's lives permantly perverted for life...and this is ..whose fault? Virtually all married men have to masturbate, because their wives ""feel little or no obligation"" to their husbands...He may make a good mindless mule to pull the marriage wagon...he's
good for carrying out the garbage, fixing the car, or typically anything requiring mindless, dirty, physcially exhausting.. grunt work.
There are a number of reasons for marital failure...but wives becoming mocking, scolding, ridculing frigid eunuchs very soon
after the honeymoon is over, is the most common reason for martial failure,,,and the extramartial affairs caused by the female's egregious, and inexcusble failure at sex. Oh, and if you think it's bad in their 30's and 40's...wait til menopause and vaginal atrophy! This movie is designed to hold men up to mockery and ridicule..and to excuse and justify the monumental failure of women in the marriage bed...and it's epidemic. Shame on all wives who think of their husbands needs very rarely if at all. They are divorcees going somewhere to happen...be sure to talk about this on your cell phones while driving, ladies, so you can have both a car crash and a marriage crash.

4348403,1,B004EPYZSA,"I haven't read any reviews that pointed this out yet but it's bugging the crap out of me while watching the film.  It seems like the whole plot was meant to make you buy things companies spent a lot of money to advertise and the writers didn't give two craps about covering that up.  There is a scene where the guys talk about how awesome Applebee's is and make it seem like a great place to hang out and be cool.  Then they throw in a reference about how you'll get laid by all the hot chicks at Chilli's.

All of this is repeated several times throughout the movie.  Frankly product placement isn't all that unusual these days so I suppose otherwise you wouldn't notice it but the plot and acting is horrible.  The actors don't seem to give a damn about trying hard and again the writers didn't give them much to strive for.  So many movies these days fail to make you like the protagonist before they start the plot going and this is another in that line.  Bathroom humor is again borne out here and I really have a hard time finding the laughter in this childish work too.

Finally im sick of this marriage is lame Hollywood kick.  What happened to just creating bold characters instead of weak willed losers. Ugh.  Avoid this movie at all costs.",1361664000,,1250,4.367965367965368

Owen Wilson & Jason Sudeikis star are those guys whose wives give them a ""hall pass"" for one week which allows them to go out and sleep with as many women as they can without any consequences.  They of course can't pick up women as they are older and out of the game, but when Owen Wilson actually has a chance to sleep with an attractive woman at the end of the film, he realizes how much his wife means to him.  The film is filled with the raunchy humor of films like Wedding Crashers, but it is a little too derivative to be a classic like that film.  It has some clever jokes and nice performances especially from Mr. Wilson and Jenna Fischer as his wife.  Mr. Sudeikis is amiable, but Christina Applegate is grating and annoying as his wife and you could see why he may want to stray. Richard Jenkins is pretty funny as what should be an over-the-hill player.

4348655,2,B004EPYZSA,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was the ""Hall Pass"" DVD. Yaawwwnnnn! It was a frivolous but mildly amusing story of a couple bored married men longing for the party, party, party days of their younger single life. Somehow, I felt as if I'd heard that story line before. Yaawwwnnnn! I might add that the parties they longed for seemed as boring as the basic plot of this movie. After a few routine marriage-type clashes with their wives, it was proposed that they be allowed to be free from marriage for a week break, what was called a ""Hall Pass."" It was proposed by the wives and, of course the husbands leaped at the opportunity to be free and unmarried, at least for a week.

The movie chronicles the events of the Hall Pass week and it bored me to watch it unfold in a predictable fashion. I might add, that I was single for over five decades and know the single life well. It's not as glamorous and fun-filled as Hollywood depicts. I think memories are filled with the pleasant times and the less-pleasant events fade away. Anyway, night after night of the Hall Pass week went buy with the main result of them getting tired and longing for home and family. Some of the incidents depicted are amusing to watch, but most of them are just embarrassing. Is that good comedy? Being embarrassed by what you're viewing? Well, I guess that's some people's idea. This movie was so cliche-ridden and predictable that I began to long for the ending. Meanwhile, the wives also had a marriage-free week, something the husbands had devoted little thought to, and they fared somewhat better. All in all, the movie was tiresome, albeit with amusing parts here and there, and I guess that's the kind of movie that fits the end of a long busy day.

4348657,4,B004EPYZSA,"Channel surfing--unless it's during the fall when football, the NBA, and playoff baseball are in full bloom--is usually an empty gesture.  If you haven't found anything in the plethora of channels to hold your attention, chances are slim you won't hit paydirt methodically moving the channel changer up and down.  So imagine my pleasurable surprise when I came across HALL PASS, a Farrelly brothers comedy that looked so lame during its theatrical run it gave me zero desire to see it; yet the moment I dialed it up on the remote and began to witness the trademark Farrelly sophomoric humor--along with a surprisingly engaging and clever dialogue--I was hooked for the long haul.  HALL PASS is as hysterically funny as it is unabashedly over the top; the story of two horny and bored husbands getting a week long ""hall pass"" from their exasperated wives scores intense comedic bliss.  And naturally, irony of ironies, while the guys' efforts to score end in one disaster after another, the wives almost fall into extramarital adventures.

Owen Wilson (sporting a ridiculous haircut) and Jason Sudeikis play the husbands with wandering eyes; in denial they are well past their prime as ""babe magnets"", they embark on a booty quest that had me donkey braying, time and time again.  Meanwhile the beleaguered wives, played by Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate, suddenly find themselves having to hold at arms' length the amorous intentions of a summer league coach and one of his players.  The guys' capers are fruitless, often with dire consequences, culminating in a seduction scene whereby Wilson's character shows his true qualities by turning down the affections of a stunning bombshell (Nicky Whelan).  Imagine my surprise when treated to a tender and thoughtful ending--but stay tuned through the closing credits, as the Farrelly boys have some more zingers coming your way.  HALL PASS is raunchy and disrespectful and irreverently outrageous; in other words, one grand adult comedy.

But my youngest son (he's over 21 - I write that because I do believe this should be a movie for the over-18 crowd) called me and recommended this movie - thought I'd enjoy the humor - and I decided to give it a try.

I'm glad I did.  It definitely had some ROFL moments in it.  Was the whole thing hilarious? No.  Did it stay funny enough to keep my interest? Yes. There were some truly memorable moments - Jason Sudeikis in his van and the looks on the two cops' faces; the jealous male barista especially at the end of the movie; the spa scene with Owen Wilson; and more.

It was great watching these over-the-hill guys trying to relive their glory moments from high school. And there were actually some thought-provoking moments, too, so it wasn't all fluff.

4348696,4,B004EPYZSA,"I have to prelude the review by saying that, one time, an Internet tough guy/girl called me a jerk on this forum.  He/She said that I panned every movie in every review I ever made, which was a flat out lie because I've given glowing reviews to 'Robocop' and my favorite album of all time:  Slayer's 'Reign In Blood'.

I went to the video store the other day for the first time in fourteen months and browsed over the titles.  I've worked with Peter before, so I grabbed this one because I like him, the movies are always good for a few laughs and if I'm actually stepping foot in that place I have to leave with something.

I can honestly say that this was the funniest movie I've seen in a decade.  I don't quite understand the myriad of negative reviews where the majority are questioning how old someone has to be to find this amusing.  I simply say you have to have some degree of personality and then you have to understand that this is actual adult situational comedy (and not the Jerry Lewis kind).  What I find brilliant about this particular adult situational comedy is that there's about 95% truth in every aspect of it and it never seems to me that the movie is trying too hard to be over-the-top (and there are many 'over-the-top' scenarios, here).

I'd give this 4.5 Stars if I could.  The only negative I'll give it is that no movie is worth 5 Stars (unless it rhymes with Schmotocop) and there's about a 10-15 minute window where there's a van destruction scene that's relatively needless/pointless.

I don't think The Farrelly Brothers are trying to trick you into thinking you're watching Dr Zhivago, here.  This is a comedy with a lot of anatomical and crass humor...and it's VERY funny.  It's also very truthful.  Guys like looking at girls regardless of how many years they've been married or how in love they are with their significant other and women are dirty, cheating dogs (for the most part).",1327190400,,1919,4.540697674418604
4348697,3,B004EPYZSA,"This movie had the potential to be great because of the relate-able premise. It had some serious moments and some funny moments. The problem with this movie is the not-so-great moments...

This movie is about 40+ year old men who get a second run. Obviously it's targeted at late 20's and older crowd. Knowing this, why did the writers feel the need to include teenage humor like waking up with another man's exposed genitalia in your face? As a grown man I can assure you that was more disgusting than funny. Did anyone really laugh when they flashed a scene at the end of someone getting sodomized in prison?

Now think about the stories/jokes/issues that this movie addresses:

-Getting older and missing your partying days
-Realizing that you don't miss it as much as you thought you did
-Realizing the freedom you seek applies to your girlfriend/spouse as well

Plus relatable issues like that one guy friend that you know wants to sleep with your wife if he had the chance. Or that attractive co-worker/old friend that's drooling all over you now that you're off the market. Or having the desire to party hard - only to realize that you're so out of touch you don't even know where to begin. With these issues it's clear the movie is targeted to 30-ish and older so why bother including toilet humor that puts off the very demographic they're trying to appeal to?

4348809,1,B004EPYZSA,"There are lots of movies touting stupid acting guys (and an increasing number of gals - way to fight for those equal rights, ladies!), overflowing with bodily fluids, sophomoric sexual one-liners, random acts of nudity, and usually some kind of mind alteration. These movies used to just be scenes strung together via dumb jokes, but thanks to The Hangover and its inexplicable Oscar nomination, now they try to pass off as farce. A farce needs clever writing and insightful satire to work well. However, the writing has become so awful and lacking in creativity that no matter how much I prepare myself for movies like this; they always let me down because they end up far more stupid than funny, and far dumber and juvenile than I anticipate. How low should expectations be?
The latest movie in this growing genre is Hall Pass, a movie I proudly lump with Step Brothers as: Worst I Have Ever Seen.  Once again, two suburban 30-40something guys find themselves in bizarre situations thanks to their complete lack of common sense and intelligence. The dopes, thanks to their 14 year old sexual maturity (obvious gawking at passing women and personal gratification in the car outside the home),  get a week away from their more-attractive-than-would-make-sense wives to get it out of their system. Let the madness begin. I've seen episodes of Gilligan's Island that worked better than Hall Pass.
What bugs me about this movie and Hollywood entertainment as a whole, is how often guys are portrayed as sex-obsessed, parentally challenged, clueless, spineless, geeky, immature morons. Yet, in every case, they are married to superior-in-every-way women who for unknown reasons tolerate these idiots. What does this say about how we view gender roles? Is this the concept of marriage that our society reflects, as seen in the mirror of Hollywood?

4348812,3,B004EPYZSA,"Hall Pass was relatively boring.  The humor was never really consistent or exciting enough to please me.

The storyline is about two men who are granted fictional hall passes by their wives that enables them to do whatever they want for exactly one week.  These hall passes were given to the husbands after they screwed up and got into a fight with their wives.

Of course the focus here is on sex since one of the wives brought to their husbands attention that the only thing men think about is sex.  I liked the response by the husband ""It's because we're wired for sex!""

So what do these men do with their hall pass?  They attend adult parties and try to score with the ladies and... that's about the only thing they really do... throughout the entire film.  WAY too much storyline downtime for me.

This is most certainly a comedy intended for viewers 40 years or older because if you're young like me, you won't find much in the way of humor or entertainment here.  The jokes are in between intelligent and juvenile, which isn't a problem in itself- it's that the storyline never picks up and GOES anywhere particularly amazing.  The movie feels like it's stuck in a loop where it *tries* to pick up and progress, but always falls back to a comfortable, forgettable groove.

Alright, there's really only two segments that seemed memorable to me.  The first is when one of the men is pleasuring himself in his parked vehicle while listening to rock music and the cops drive by and witness this dirty act taking place, and the other funny part is near the end during a car chase segment and there's a guy on the roof of the vehicle swinging a club at the windows while the cops persue after the car.  That's about all she wrote as far as laughs are concerned.

I'm noticing that Owen Wilson is really growing older.  I've never noticed it before.  We all grow older of course so I'm not necessarily complaining about it.  On the flipside it's not only remarkable that Christina Applegate still looks young, she's also as attractive as ever.  I'm starting to develop a thing for Jenna Fischer as well.

Overall, short on the actual laughs turns out to be this movies downfall, but for older folks out there searching for a mild comedy, you may find something appealing here.  The younger folks should look elsewhere.",1323475200,,2319,4.580097087378641

I had purchased Inception from Target on June 12, 2011 for $29.99. When I attempted to redeem the digital copy, I found it had expired on May 6, 2011 -- over a month before I had purchased it. I contacted Warner Brothers about what had happened, and the representative told me there was nothing I could do because they adequately posted the expiration date on the DVD insert, the redemption Web site, and on the box. Two of those methods are moot because you have to open the box before finding out the information. The expiration date is on the back of the DVD in fine print, meanwhile the  ""+ digital copy"" is in very large print on the front of the box. How many times do you look at the back of a movie before buying it? So obviously Warner Brothers wasn't helpful, and Target wouldn't take the movie back even though some of the ""product"" had expired before purchase because I had opened it. I have unsuccessfully tried to resolve this with the corporations involved, so I'm warning the public directly now to prevent it from happening to other consumers.",1321747200,20,1193,4.5488372093023255

Not the case here.  I thought some of the humor overly crude, and could have been tamed down.  However, some of the stuff in here was so funny that you better not have a mouth full of anything or you'll have a mess on your hands.  Ex. There's a scene where Owen Wilson's character and his friend are in a house and think they are alone.  In fact, they're on a closed circuit TV system bashing the owners in front of all their friends and families.

They should paint her and hang her up in a art museum. The movie was a huge let down and didn't really fit the plot description it was a lot of dead air and i don't think i laughed once! Owen wilson definitely took a step back in his career with this film and i love the guy! Don't ever pay to watch this film.

4348933,5,B004EPYZSA,"Not sure if it was the wine or what, but my husband and I definitely got 5-stars worth of laughs out of this. Part of it was the cast, which was excellent for this kind of comedic material - Owen Wilson married to Jenna Fischer (of The Office) and Jason Sudeikis married to Christina Applegate. The basic premise is that the Jenna and Christina characters give their husbands a week off from marriage. They try to get laid (sort of), while the women discover it may be them that needed the break. The best demographic for this film is definitely the 30/40-something-with-kids-and-a-minivan crowd.

It's a Farrelly brother movie, so there is plenty of gross-out humor, but I thought it was actually funny, as opposed to most gross-out humor which completely misses the mark. I grimaced at a particularly gross scene involving a nicotine-addicted flake picked up by Jason Sudeikis's character, but I also laughed, and at the very least it was not a scene I had seen before.

I think much of the credit for the movie working goes to Owen Wilson, who is at his soulful, quirky best here, although all four leads were great. Don't get me wrong, this is not a masterpiece, but it delivers on what it claims to be - a romantic comedy by the Farrelly's, so I felt it deserves 5 stars in its category.",1316217600,,1292,4.588744588744588

In a way, the certain lack of unpredictability made it even funnier. So, the premise is two of the guys in a group of friends are granted a one week marriage hall pass by their wives, in the hopes that they will recapture their desire to be around each other and maybe rekindle the flame. They are basically not married for one week, and stay in different cities from their wives for that week. There are no rules...if they want to find some young hottie to spend time with, they can. Of course, the guys have both been married so long that they've forgotten how to actually be single. Plus, they wrestle with conflicting emotions regarding their hall pass. I won't tell you much else except to say that the guys find themselves in a plethora of compromising and embarrassing situations. As an added bonus, this movie shows both perspectives...both guy and gal, so you can watch this with your significant other and not feel like you are doing anything wrong when you are laughing at the situations the characters find themselves in. Enjoy!

p.s. If you are easily offended, don't watch this movie. It is all about sex and relationships, cheating and not cheating, and a few penises make their way onto the screen as well.",1315094400,,1342,4.615062761506276

I was literally awaiting cameos from Vince Vaughn and Will Ferrell, instead of the actors, I got reincarnations of characters they played in the aforementioned films.

Of course, these guys were not going to cheat on their wives, duh.

What could have been a decent movie was almost unwatchable. Of course, a mandatory car race occurs at the end, which does nothing to enhance the quality of this movie.

Dude...I don't watch movies to see that kinda crap. I don't know why some movie producers & directors feel that there needs to be that kinda crap in movies. It was perfectly funny on it's own without that kinda stuff. There was also this part where one of them brings a girl to a hotel room and she has an issue...was kinda disturbing.

It seemed like they were trying hard to go the Hangover route, but also trying to make it into a good-hearted comedy. Similar to the 40 year old virgin. which is probably why the two main guys were such geeks. I didn't find myself caring much about them and their situations.

I don't mind the raunchy crude comedy, but if you are going to go that route. You need to go all the way and be over the top. The whole thing seemed too scripted and didn't really flow.

Also, this movie should not be an hour and forty five minutes long. They need to have a director's cut and throw out about 20-30 minutes. I actually stopped it at an hour and thirty minutes.
I should have stopped it a lot sooner.

Possibly a record for any movie in history thus far.

A couple reviewers said ""laughed til I cried"" or ""hilarious""-- what movie did you watch?  I mean, I am being completely earnest right now when I say those viewers must have been drinking heavily or smoking some really interesting things before watching this. I read mixed reviews beforehand, so I knew it might not be great--but I really wasn't prepared for how much I would actually hate it.

Let me just say, I am not a comedy snob. I laugh at everything. I'm rarely offended. Also, I watch SNL, which is why I love Jason Sudeikis, but this movie just fell short at every angle. What could have been a clever plot that set up loads of hilarious situations was instead boring, slow, and unimaginative. I constantly felt like I was waiting for something funny to happen, but it NEVER did. The lackluster dialogue between actors Wilson and Sudeikis truly let me down the most. Each attempt to be funny morphed into something disgusting(once again, not offended by this, just revealing that you should expect projectile diarrhea.) Only it wasn't funny-gross, it was just sad-gross--like watching Kathy Griffin live life on the D-list...and that analogy directly correlates to the movie, in case you do in fact, watch it.

As a result of the trailer, I went into this movie expecting a lot more than I got.  Yes, it had some funny moments.  Yes, I did laugh out loud a few times.  But it really wasn't more than an average movie.  Perhaps my review would have been a bit different if I went into the movie blindly, just having caught it on TV randomly or something.

With that said, the Austalian girl in the movie who played the Barista in the coffee shop is SMOKING HOT, and I honestly might watch the movie again just to see her topless!

Owen Wilson is a really fun guy and I love his personality.  Every time I see him now, I think, why did this guy try to kill himself a few years back?  If he wasn't in this movie, it would have been horrible.  Jason Sudeikis, I didn't care for much in this role.",1308614400,18,1036,4.251282051282051

4349214,2,B004EPYZSA,"What does it say when the best parts of a film are in the outtakes?

Pathetically derivative screenplay and predictably average direction. Pretty much what you would expect mixing  '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fried-Green-Tomatoes/dp/6305212112/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fried Green Tomatoes</a>' with '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hangover/dp/B003VQZ5BO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hangover</a>'.

The best gag: Stephen Merchant in one of the outtakes. One could say that his most prominent presence comes at the end - and takes place there too. X-D

Yikes, I'm going to have a difficult time watching/listening to the man when he does his bit on the Ricky Gervais Show and the upcoming '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-Idiot-Abroad-The-Bucket-List/dp/B003Y734AO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An Idiot Abroad, The Bucket List</a>'. {:-D

4349215,4,B004EPYZSA,"The movie itself, you can judge.. It has its moments, but is no Me, Myself, and Irene IMO...

There is an extended cut of the film (Enlarged Edition) which runs approx 6 minutes longer and has an additional 8 scenes. Sadly, other than one in particular.. the scenes are nothing too special nor do they change the film drastically. The movie is a mixture of comedy and seriousness (more towards the end). Sometimes the serious scenes outweigh the funny ones..

The additional scenes that are added in the extended version are listed below:

1) 30 min. Day One: The guys pick up Gary from the house. Apparently, his wife doesn't know about their plans because he climbs out of the first floor window. He suddenly falls down and limps the rest of the way to the car..

2) 43 min. Day Three: Rick and Fred finally start to put some effort in their pick-up attempts and are standing in front of a hip club. At first, the doorman doesn't want to let them in, however, they bribe him with 50 dollars. Still, he thinks that he might lose his job if he lets them go inside. The camera then cuts to Rick, Fred, and the doorman (who just lost his job) as they all eat a hot dog. =)

3) 47 min. Day Five: Rick has lunch and leaves a message on his wife's voicemail inbox. He says that he misses her and the kids. Then, the waitress brings him a free dessert made by the cookee. Rick looks around for her but suddenly, the cookee says that the dessert was meant for the other blond guy the cookee apparently has the hots for. Rick looks sad.
Cut to the office. Rick tries some online dating but again doesn't really succeed. Fred thinks that it's not the best idea to use a photo that shows Rick with his wife and family. Suddenly, Fred comes up with an idea that is to backfire later on. Apparently, they can't make strange women like them enough to sleep with them, so they should try to hit on women they already know.
Subsequently he visits one of his old friends - Missy - and brings her some Greek food to break the ice; he does that because he rememered that her last name had a Greek origin. Too bad that it was her ex-husband's name. Fred explains her how his vacation week from his marraige works and hopes to be able to sleep with Missy. However, she's not really satisfied with his clumsy hit on and slams the door in front of him. Fred is frustrated and doesn't understand why she did this. Not too funny..

4) 67 min. Day 6: Rick tries to impress Leigh (the hot blonde from the coffee shop) in the club by putting a huge snake around his neck. After a quick cut we see that this wasn't the best idea. This is the funniest additional scene, hands down..

5) 68 min. Day 6: Rick dances on the bar without wearing a shirt. In the extended version he also breaks a glass.

6) 69 min. Day 6: Rick's bill in the Club adds up to 1400 dollars because the drinks are unbelievably expensive. He tries to skip out on the tab but doesn't succeed.

7) 69 min. Day 6: Rick shouts to the bartender that he shouldn't dare to put a tip on their bill.

8) 69 min. Day 6: During the scene transition the theatrical version instead shows the women's motel.

All and all, nothing too much added that makes me want to just buy the combo pack with extended version..If you end up with just the theatrical version, I'd say your just fine and are not missing much. Hope it's been helpful..Enjoy

4349306,3,B004EPYZSA,"Some comedies sneak up on you.  You think they're going to be brilliant and then they fall flat, or you think they're going to be stale and vulgar and end up being delightfully complex.  The latter is the case with HALL PASS.  It's a relatively simple premise: two middle-aged men get ""hall passes"" from their wives, which means they get to spend a week being single.  Predictable shenanigans ensue: horrendous pick-up attempts; gross-out gags; dick jokes; drug and booze binges; a redemptive finale.

And yet, HALL PASS manages to carve something original.  Not only do Rick and Fred get a week off, but so do their wives--and therein lies much of the depth of the film.  Granted, we're not talking a masterpiece here--it's the Farrelly Brothers for crying out loud, and note the absence of two stars in this review.  HALL PASS isn't transcendental of its buddy-raunchy film genre; it falls victim to the same flaws, the same generic traps.  Yet, there is something in this film that makes it better than much of its ilk.  Putting your thumb on exactly WHAT that saving grace is can be tricky, though.

The casting is definitely a plus.  Owen Wilson is in good form--he can hit or miss, and here he mostly hits.  So to does Jason Sudeikis, despite some rather flat writing for his character.  The casting of their wives is truly inspired: the pairing of comedy veterans Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate is utterly delightful, and provides an emotional depth that would otherwise be missing (she's typecast, but darn if Applegate doesn't have great dramatic chops as well).  Perhaps the truly original thing here, at least the part that makes the film stand out from its peers, is how it tackles middle age.  These aren't young AMERICAN PIE frat boys; these are over-the-hill, settled-down, one-beer-a-week dads who have been given a chance to sow their wild oat.  HALL PASS isn't great, and it's heavily flawed--but yes, it may just surprise you a little, which in this day and age is cause for celebration.",1307923200,2,2013,4.822157434402333
4349307,5,B004EPYZSA,"""Are you sure Applebee's is the best place to meet hot women?""  After Rick's (Wilson) and Fred's (Sudeikis) wives decide the best way to fix thier marriages is to give them a ""Hall Pass"" (a one week break from being married).  What starts off as a blessing soon becomes more then they can handle.  I was not sure what to fully expect from this movie. I expected funny but I was ready for dissapointment.  I was wrong.  This is a laugh-out-loud movie from start to finish.  Very raunchy in parts, but it is a Farrelly Brothers movie so that is expected.  The casting is great and Wilson and Sudeikis do a great job of playing off each other.  I do have to say that Richard Jenkins (not really known for comedic roles) is the perfect choice for his part and almost steals the movie from everyone.  This is the funniest comedy to be released in a long time.  While it does have a few serious moments it is more consistently funny the ""The Dilemma"" and even more so then ""Just Go With It"".  Owen Wilson is back to ""Wedding Crashers"" form and it is great to see him be that funny again, it's been a while.  This is a definate must see and you will laugh so hard your face will hurt.  Overall an excellent comedy that will not dissapoint.  I give it an A.

Would I watch again? - Absolutely I will, I would buy this!

4349310,5,B004EPYZSA,"Owen Wilson's character no matter the movie usually annoys me so much that I cannot sit through the entire film, but this one he actually was halfway decent of an actor.

If you like raunchy comedies, then this is right up your alley!",1301788800,2,404,4.5479452054794525
4349313,2,B004EPYZSA,"Remember when the Farrelly Brothers made funny films? Remember ""There's Something About Mary""? Their new film ""Hall Pass"" desperately wants you to remember this connection. ""Mary"" seems to be the watershed moment in the Brothers' career and raised our expectations too high, I guess they hope we will be fooled into believing ""Hall Pass"" is as good... Is any good...

The new film is funny, at times, and contains the required necessary Farrelly gross out gags (which are also funny), but you expect more from the Brothers; many, many jokes don't work, the film stars Owen Wilson who is spectacularly miscast and the film looks like it was made at an old shopping mall. The film is a wash, a mess and a trial to sit through..

Rick (Wilson), a realtor, is married to Maggie (Jenna Fischer, TV's ""The Office"") and is best friends with Fred (Jason Sudeikis, ""Saturday Night Live""), an insurance salesman, who is married to Grace (Christina Applegate). Both men are adults who act as mature as the horny teenagers they wish they still were. Rick watches an attractive young woman walk by while he is with his wife, upsetting her. The two women talk with their friend, Dr. Lucy (Joy Behar, WTF?) who mentions that she gave her husband a 'hall pass' many years ago. He didn't use it, but the idea of it reinvigorated their marriage.  After much discussion, Maggie and Grace decide to give it a try. Rick and Fred are ecstatic and their circle of buddies, Gary (Stephen Merchant, Ricky Gervais' producing partner), Hog-Head (Larry Joe Campbell) and Flats (J. B. Smoove) want ringside seats for the week of debauchery.

There are a few laughs in ""Hall Pass"", but these seem few and very far between. When you are sitting in a theater, watching a comedy, and you sit for long periods of time without laughing, what happens? The film seems very long. Worse, when you do find yourself laughing at the silly, stupid humor and the gross out gags, you remember back to ""There's Something About Mary"". These filmmakers once made a film that was so funny I had to watch it again to catch all of the jokes I missed the first time. ""Hall Pass"" doesn't suffer the same fate. What happened between the two films? Did they forget how to make us laugh?

When we first meet Rick and Fred, there seem to be a lot of opportunities for laughs. But these opportunities seem to evaporate in thin air. I think a lot of the problem arises from the casting, Owen Wilson is miscast. Rick is supposed to be the moral center of the film. Yes, he jumps at the chance to use his hall pass, but he also seems the most conflicted about it. Wilson usually plays the schemer, the mover and shaker, the liar and this provides him with something to so, no matter how annoying it may be. In ""Hall Pass"", he doesn't have this and it makes him seem boring. He can't do anything with the character to make him seem interesting and worth watching. He simply whines through most of the film.

I haven't really liked a lot of Owen Wilson's work in the past few years, have I? Yet, I keep going to his films. He seems to continue getting work with filmmakers I admire or hope to enjoy, yet he is often the worst thing about the film. In ""Hall Pass"", he isn't the worst thing, but he doesn't add enough to redeem it either.

Jason Sudeikis plays Fred who, unlike Rick, doesn't seem to have a moral compass. Or at least he doesn't seem to care as much about cheating on his wife. And he relishes the outlandish things Rick does. And these antics provide most of the laughs in the film.

Jenna Fischer and Cristina Applegate play the wives. I'm not sure if these roles are supposed to be completely humorless, but they are. The two women realize that if there husbands get a hall pass, they should get the same. So they head to the shore. There, they meet two guys who start to pour on the charm. The husbands are cheating, why can't they?

There are two or three gross out gags providing the most memorable moments in the entire film. But that's a bit of a double-edged sword. I'm thankful the gags are there, but it is disappointing they are the best and most memorable bits of the film. In a better film, they would only be an accent. But that would be in a better film.

A lot of the little story lines and some of the characters seem to go nowehere. Rick is attracted to a beautiful, younger Australian woman who works at the coffee shop he frequents. Her co-worker, a nerdy guy who looks like he would be at home at an open mike poetry night, takes offense and an instant dislike to Rick. He sees him oogling his co-worker. Every time Rick comes in, the male barista tries to stand in his way. Again, an amusing idea but it doesn't go anywhere. The filmmakers are only interested in getting Rick and the young woman together. And this seems to take forever.

The Greek Chorus surrounding Rick and Fred are a mixed bag, It is an amusing concept; three nerdy, equally childish men trying to live vicariously through their 'heroes'. But nothing really develops and they disappear for at least half of the film. Stephen Merchant is the most memorable and has a funny moment during the credits. Honestly, if the entire film were of the same quality as these last few moments, we would have another ""There's Something About Mary"".

Richard Jenkins plays Coakler, a man both men revere for his skills with the women. Fred and Rick refer to him many times throughout, their circle of friends also seem to revere him. But when he makes an appearance, very late in the story, he is completely forgettable. It wasn't worth waiting for him and the anticipation only serves to highlight how disappointing this usually very talented actor's participation is.

Joy Behar pops up as a published author. I guess she is supposed to be modeled on Dr. Laura, and friend of Maggie and Grace, Why Joy Behar is in this film is beyond me, way beyond me, a space galaxy beyond me. She isn't funny and doesn't seen as though she is supposed to.

Perhaps the most perplexing thing is how cheap the film looks. It seems like the entire film was shot in a shopping mall because every scene seems lit incorrectly, it appears harsh, fake and the light washes out all detail giving everything a flat look. I don't normally comment on such things unless it is really noticeable or really bad. In ""Hall Pass"" it is both.

""Hall Pass"" is a big misfire. The few jokes don't make up for the interminable amount of time spent waiting for them to happen. The Farrelly Brothers' next film is ""The Three Stooges"". Originally, Jim Carrey and Sean Penn were going to star. That would be interesting. But both dropped out. Now Andy Samburg is the big headliner. Should we take a cue from Carrey and Penn and get a ""Hall Pass"" for the Farrelly Brothers' next film?",1301011200,6,6773,4.517551020408163
