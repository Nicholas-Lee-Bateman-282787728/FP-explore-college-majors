5948635,5,B00EVU3RWS,It's not my typical movie but I enjoyed watching it. The story is captivating in its own way.,1409702400,,93,4.222222222222222
5948636,4,B00EVU3RWS,"Gal pretends to be Guy
  (for ""his"" newspaper column

Gal sees Guy
Gal sketches Guy
Gal uses Sketch for her column

Guy seeks Guy, to kill Guy
But can't find Guy because Guy doesn't exist

and if you think all of the above is weird,
IT GETS WEIRDER

I can't quite give this movie five stars, though then last fifteen minutes of the movie were five stars.

It was a fun diversion for a boring Monday afternoon when i should have been doing my homework for the OCW program at MIT.EDU

Now, if I can get Mr. Know It All to motivate me to do my self-paced Calculus a little bit faster.",1408924800,7,581,4.125
5948637,2,B00EVU3RWS,"uh, that was absolutely ridiculous. girl has advice column under moniker Mr. Know It All. needs a face for her column. finds man in theater. uses his face. he's recognized all across town. he's a hitman and is out to kill mr. know it all. the man and woman meet twice and suddenly are head over heels. some realllly stupid hitman stuff happens. and it turns out she doesn't care that he's a hitman.

but the man i quite attractive and the moral of the story is...don't sit around waiting for life to happen because you're too scared to pursue it. and something about evil monkey feet.",1408233600,6,584,4.457943925233645

5948639,4,B00EVU3RWS,"Funny and quirky romantic comedy.  It's pretty good, u gotta find out how it ends!  hahaha.  some wacky scenes and crazy story line with some twists.  made me laugh. easy to watch and kick it.",1406505600,5,192,4.4

5948643,2,B00EVU3RWS,"I'll give them a little credit, here. They were aiming for a lighthearted romantic comedy, and they hit it on the nose.

This being said, everything about this movie screamed 'mediocre,' from the music choice to the script. While this concept could have been shaped into something unique and beautiful, the writing proved drab and made the characters out to be complete, utter idiots. Usually I fall head-over-heals for corny rom-coms, but this one needs a bit of work.

The actors have the potential to be great, and the script- if edited properly- could have been something wonderful. I can tell that those in charge had something beautiful in mind, and it is a shame to see the work and intelligence of all of these people being wasted on something that is so predictable and conventional.",1490745600,,792,4.8161764705882355

5948646,2,B00EVU3RWS,"Cute but awkward. There's not really much to it as a story and the characters aren't very convincing. All-in-all seemed like a school project, rushing through specific plot devices and storytelling tricks, but without substance.",1487462400,,228,5.542857142857143

5948656,4,B00EVU3RWS,The story is very funny and script is top notch. Unfortunately the leading actor and actress had no chemistry to make the budding romance seem plausible.

5948661,1,B00EVU3RWS,"The leading man is a hit man.  I guess I should have guessed from the title, but I thought it was metaphorical, not literal.  The dark comedy aspect of joking about killing people just is not humorous to me.  I liked the leading lady except she 1) kept lying and taking advantage of a stranger 2) was stupid enough to think picking a random guy off the street to be the face for ""Mr. Know It All"" made more sense than hiring an actor or model  and 3) she started shooting people and acting like it was no big deal.

I guess the scene where they were making out and she was telling him she loved him (after having one walk, one meeting, and one dinner with him) while he was debating what weapon to kill her with while he embraced her was supposed to be funny.  I found it kinda sick--especially when he actually held the knife pointed at her as if he was about to stab her while he was kissing her and she was talking about how she'd fallen in love with him.

Oh, but it's all okay because she ends up partnered with the hit man and about to have his baby...and her boss ends up dating a stupid hit man.  Not as stupid as most of the hit men in the movie, who seem to be comic relief...except they aren't funny, just idiotic.

Plot holes?  Don't get me started.  Stupid from start to finish.  (Seriously, a successful hit man is not going to mind the lady staring at him and sketching him for two hours during a movie?  If he's THAT oblivious, how does he do his job?)",1479427200,,1468,4.144876325088339

Plus, I've seen a couple of the actors in other things and liked them so I can only assume the flaws in this movie were the terrible direction and weak script. It was entertaining enough not to warrant 1-2 stars (which I reserve for movies that I am literally screaming at the screen) and worth every penny of the free screening through Prime.",1478217600,,520,4.427083333333333

5948731,5,B00EVU3RWS,"First, addressing something important; noticed a number of reviewers talking about plot holes, and there aren't any.  This film borrows on some French Film styles of storytelling with some well foreshadowed film noir references, and is largely presented in a delightful spin on traditional film noir themes such as those used in films such as Casablanca that also included many such classic storytelling themes and atmospheres.

To follow this excellent story this is not a film to be watched while multi-tasking, and if an audience member is unable to track all of the story after a maximum of two viewings, you may consider you're watching/sharing/attempting to share this fantastic film experience with someone who's very distracting when it comes to watching movies, it may be time to broaden the cerebral stimulation of media choices in order to truly appreciate this film, or it could simply be time to look into seeking a professional capable of treating Attention Deficit Disorder because despite the film's wide array of considerably well developed characters and related storylines (especially considering this is barely a 90 minute feature), the story is actually very easy to follow with all of the story elements flowing very smoothly into one another.  In fact, this review will go so far as to declare, the film's makers and editors should all receive multiple academy awards for not only staying within the limited budget of what is clearly a low-budget independently produced film with a production value so high that it obviously required the utmost attention to detail in the field of project management, but also cutting together the film in such a way that the entire story flowed together so nicely to its conclusion.

This is not a formulaic romantic comedy by any means, and with Hollywood so obsessed with mass producing romantic comedies solely with star power behind the actors' names more so than the actors' talents; it becomes abundantly clear from the leadership example set by the entire crew and cast of this film with definite emphasis on the terrific performances of the two leads that this film told a great story in such a unique way that its divergence from being a traditional romantic comedy in such a way as to require the audience's attention while also endearing it is the kind of storytelling there needs to be more of not just with romantic comedies, but media in general that is so commonly mindless.

A few of the characters were goofballs, but nonetheless they'd standards and reasons of their own within the story to be in the situations they were in, and while the twists weren't necessarily predictable, they weren't surprising with exception to one brilliant aspect of telling any story ""timing.""

The timing of all of the story elements was often surprising; although not shocking, but nonetheless, a ""surprise"" is nothing other than a ""surprise.""  All of the surprises were not only interesting, they were at times left with a little mystery and continued to give this great story some of its momentum as well.

The most pleasant element of this film was indeed the romance because the chemistry between the two leads was both tactful and completely tenable through the screen with that kind of intense presentation of two people coming together being so rare in romantic stories for nearly the past 20 years of film.  In essence, it really makes the audience want everything to go well so these two characters can be together no matter the situation.

This is an endearing romantic comedy that is highly recommend to people who meet the following criteria:

1 - Have at least a small dark streak to your sense of humor because if you're lacking one, this film isn't for you.

2 - Must not give into presumption because this story does require the use of mind and memory in an intelligent manner - For EXAMPLE; It's been noticed some reviewers did not follow the story well, but also are arguing with the film's points about the kind of weapons the hitmen were using; however this reviewer has worked with law enforcement in the past professionally and is trained on how criminals that perform wetwork do their business, so this reviewer can declare .44 calibers are not an unusual choice for hitmen (provided sniper rifles are excluded from the discussion since they're very different weapons compared to sidearms) because .44 calibers come in a variety of models many of which are lightweight, easily concealed, and can have various types of customized ammunition with a large variety of modifications for accuracy depending upon the choice of .44 caliber while also being easily silenced, but not very loud to begin with when compared to some .22 caliber and even 9mm weapons.  If one is to have worked professionally with law enforcement, one is trained to know what to look for in the event one encounters a suspect with a concealed weapon.  It can honestly be said that the filmmakers clearly looked into the subject of wet work criminals likely by looking at police and non-classified FBI reports (the Freedom of Information Act a.k.a. FOIA is a beautiful thing), and were clearly very well researched on the subject while portraying it both well and relevantly in the story with special emphasis on some of the character dialog that occurred between two of the characters in a scene where they were in a bar making comment about other characters besides themselves talking about a .45 caliber weapon (not going to provide too many specific details about the scene because not into spoiling a good story, but confident an attentive viewer will spot this scene with ease).

3 - Raise your expectations of romantic comedies - This film definitely sets a new standard for the genre.  Don't expect completely mindless entertainment, but also understand that this film is not difficult to understand.  Nobody's expecting the performance of calculus equations to find the Higgs Boson by enjoying this well portrayed story with a variety of great story telling and noir atmosphere elements.

4 - Don't watch tired or with more than one glass of wine.

5 - Watch with someone who shares an interest in watching a great film without being a critic (or a talker) during the film because they'll take away from an otherwise excellent film that does indeed set a new bar for the entire romantic comedy genre.  In short, hold hands, enjoy yourselves, and if you like, be film critics after completely watching the film.  ;)

This is a great romantic comedy that is cerebral, funny, and entertaining with a great cast, intriguing characters with some having intriguing friendships, and two leads that absolutely warm the screen with their chemistry.

Don't miss out on this mildly dark, yet warm romantic comedy that is in spite of its complexity, easy to follow, easy to enjoy, and easy to fall in love with.  <3

5948810,5,B00EVU3RWS,"Quirky doesn't begin to cover this movie with a description.

The premise has been done before but the honesty of the characters pulls this plot through.

I'll hit the downers first. There are plot holes big enough to drive a bus through. For the techno geek, yeah OK a hit man isn't going to use a 9mm, Sig Sauer or not. Note to the producers, it would have been a .22 and the weapon and the hit man part ways within a few minutes. The scenes not including the main character are not well stitched into the main flow of the plot. The scenes should have been left out and additional scenes from the main plot included.

The main characters pull this movie through as does the bright scripting. We have two people conflicted and cut off from the lives they should be leading. The woman because of a broken home and the certainty that any wish will turn bring grief. The man, and for once a complex personality not a cardboard cut out who is only the object of desire, who can't imagine how much more there is to a life. It was fascinating to watch them interact working through how to make different lives and experience work together. It was more pleasurable watching attraction turn to love.

This is a flawed film and yet somehow all the better for it. It is in the end a movie that screams about overcoming perceived limitations and grasping life.",1427500800,2,1350,4.431451612903226

5948846,4,B00EVU3RWS,"Put me down with the 'I likes its"".  Not your typical romantic comedy story-line.  Were there some plot holes?  Sure, it was meant to be comedy not action-drama.  Although, I still haven't figured out where she got the second pistol in the apartment?
The final scene needed more attention.  It seemed to have been thrown together, almost as an after-thought.
  Very credible performance from the cast, Ms. Chorstecki was charming, Mr. Brown reminds me of young Pierce Brosnan.  (Did anybody else get that too?)  Cliff Saunders can start taking over Joe Pesci's roles, since Joe has retired.",1412467200,4,590,5.0

At times the acting wasn't the best but it definitely had some funny parts and really its not suppose to be real life its off the wall and that is what makes it fun.  I thought they had some good chemistry which makes it work at the movie goes on!  Not a great review but I did like the movie n wanted to offset the naysayers!!!!,1410998400,,393,3.949367088607595
5948850,5,B00EVU3RWS,"Were there a few holes in the plot? Yes. Were some of the scenes with other hitmen/henchmen/mob people stupid? Yes. Did I have a little trouble understanding what was going on during the scenes with the other hitmen/henchmen/mob people? Yes. I would have only given this movie 3 or 4 stars because of those problems except for a few reasons. 1. It left me feeling at the end like I'd watched a pretty entertaining movie. 2. The movie actually had me giggling like a school girl during certain points. 3. The chemistry between the two main stars was strong. 3. The main story was somewhat original and interesting even if it did have shades of ""Grosse Pointe Blank"" to it.  And most importantly, 4. Jefferson Brown. Where has he been hiding? He was so engaging in this movie. So good looking and funny. It's no wonder that she got over him being a hit man and planning to kill her so fast. I'd be pretty stupid and awkward around him too. So because of these reasons and because I already want to watch it again, I give this movie a high rating. Don't go into watching this movie thinking it is serious. It is not a high quality movie, but it is entertaining and has several good moments. Last half is better than the first. I was left wanting more, but in this case, that's a good thing.",1410134400,23,1287,4.407563025210084

8609968,2,B00EVU3RWS,"Truly terrible romance plotting.
HUGE SPOILERS AHEAD:
There are a lot of flaws here, but the big one is the writing of the romance.  She's a self-pitying ditz and a liar and he's a hitman, so already they're hard to like, and then he falls in love with her because she's kind of pathetic and she falls for him because he's gorgeous and then he finds out she's filmed him without his permission and she finds out he's been hired to kill her and they bitch at each other for the rest of the movie.  It's not just that they're unlikable as written, it's that there is absolutely no reason for them to ever be together.  If you want audiences to believe in a relationship, you have to show that relationship building, trust in the partnership, which does not happen here.  They're both attractive and they like the same music, which is a start, but they're both such awful people and they treat each other so badly (well, she treats him badly, he just thinks about killing her with a knife in his hand while she's got her arms around him) that any ""now they're in love"" declaration falls flat.  And the coda at the end is ridiculously trite.  I made it through the whole movie because I kept waiting for them to fall in love instead of bitch and moan and it never happened.  Terrible romance writing.",1514678400,,1296,4.420168067226891

8609976,4,B00EVU3RWS,"Sadly, this movie's story had potential if a major studio had accepted it, then put some serious money behind it. But this movie was so low-budget that the story could not be more fully developed. There were some nice twists and turns thought up here, but they look they had to be cut short for budgetary reasons. Another 20 minutes added for more development would have been nice. Also, the sets looked cheaper than any tv movie set. The acting was excellent, as was much of the dialogue, so it's a shame the writer could not have sold the story to a major studio. But I still give it four stars for the story and the acting under the severe budgetary limits imposed.",1493596800,,668,4.439024390243903
