1990227,3,B0001DCYJG,"With four Angelina videos I was eager for more to be released.  When this came out I though my wait was over.  But when I received my order I realized what had happened.  This video contains two stories (not four like the others) and both are in earlier collections.

First is The Ballet Tickets from ROSE FAIRY PRINCESS.  Angelina will do anything to see her ballet heroes perform.  If only she had tickets to the performance.

Second is Two Mice in a Boat from ANGELINA IN THE WINGS.  Here Angelina must learn how to cooperate with the tough guy Sammy as they are teamed together in the annual boat decoration competition.

These are good stories but if you have ROSE FAIRY PRINCESS and ANGELINA IN THE WINGS, you will already have these stories.",1148342400,66,748,4.56390977443609

8010435,5,B0001DCYJG,Angelina ballerina movies are always a hit! My 4 year old daughter absolutely loves them and it teaches a good lesson! This one only had two episodes but we replay them over and over.,1382054400,,183,4.411764705882353
8010436,4,B0001DCYJG,I bought this for my great-granddaughter and she loves it. I think it is just about the best DVD I bought for her so far. I even enjoyed the characters and plot.  Good for children without violence.,1310860800,,198,4.351351351351352
8010437,5,B0001DCYJG,"We love Angelina Ballerina and all her friends and neighbors. She is a typical little ""girl"" with typical issues and the stories are told with a sweet gentleness, even when things go wrong. This was a gift for my little neice and she loves to watch AB now!",1296000000,,256,4.354166666666667
8010438,5,B0001DCYJG,"I bought this DVD and another Angelina Ballerina DVD for my grandchildren about 3 years ago. My granddaughter was then aged about 4 and my grandson 2. They both loved them. My granddaughter had started ballet classes. I would say this DVD or any of the other DVDs would make great gifts for young children. They are not very expensive like some of the other children's DVD's and a fun, and teach kids important lessons in life.",1295913600,2,427,4.558441558441558
8010439,3,B0001DCYJG,"First off the artwork in this cartoon is very pleasing to the eye. It's makes the whole cartoon feel warm and gives it that timeless feeling. As an adult even I was interested enough to see the cartoons once. I will assume your little girls will want to watch this over and over again; this dvd is not long enough for that. The cartoons are short - about 10 minutes each. My biggest problem is I wish it had more cartoons than just the 2, but their still good to watch..I'm not sure I would recommend this as a first dvd to buy, however. I personally would look into one of the others that have 4 cartoons. The girls love Angelina to pieces, so we didn't pass this one up even though we expected more.
On this dvd is features young children doing ballet. The moves the instruct are simple and Angelina's voice is there to cheer them on as they try the different ballet moves. The first ballet is a reenactment of the episode Second is Two Mice in a Boat episode - a little girl and boy put on costumes one is a pirate the other is a princess.
This dvd is worth a watch to every aspiring young dancer.",1288915200,2,1100,4.193396226415095
8010440,5,B0001DCYJG,"My 3 1/2 grand daughter just began dancing lessons, so of course I wanted to introduce her to Angelina.  This was the perfect ""lst"" DVD to view. She was mesmerized by its content AND... erased whatever trepidation she had of mice.",1254960000,,230,4.609756097560975
8010441,5,B0001DCYJG,I love the Angelina Ballerina video series.  They inspire young dancers while teaching them the life skills necessary for the art.,1247529600,,130,5.190476190476191
8010442,5,B0001DCYJG,"My granddaughter is 3 1/2 years old and loves this active little dancer!  The accents are British (Judy Dench and her daughter speak the star roles) but easily understood.  Angelina is a bit self-centered but ultimately she comes through for her friends.  My granddaughter asked to go a ballet class after seeing the DVD (many, many times) so we enrolled her and she loves the class.",1223769600,2,383,4.7727272727272725
