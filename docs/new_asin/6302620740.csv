493269,5,6302620740,"This movie, in my opinion, was brilliantly done.  Eddie Murphy plays Marcus Graham, a suave marketing executive with a big ""little black book.""  His calculating style of romancing women, and his diverse  range of buddies (a romantic - unknown actor, and a racist - played my  Martin Lawrence) give us interesting dialogue during their luncheons, etc.
Enter Robin Williams, who plays Jacqueline Broyer, Marcus' new boss.  She's gorgeous, witty, and turns the tables by playing him.  A first for  Marcus, who then goes downhill until he starts dating Angela, played by  Halle Berry...
This movie is filled with stars and gorgeous women, but in  a tactful manner.  Murphy is brilliant, and the humor is great as well.",912556800,,714,5.0256410256410255

By the time I sat down to watch it again, my rental expired.  They should consider timing the rental window by the actual time you spend watching it. If I pause, I should be able to pick it up in a few days. Maybe allow 2 complete views rather than just a 48 hour window.",1518912000,,435,3.9431818181818183

When will studios understand they can tell a good story without inappropriate language and behavior. Amazon Prime has nothing to offer...no way of getting edited versions or clean viewing options and worst of all...most of the programming is not included in Prime and you still have to go through a third party",1500768000,,505,4.952941176470588

493439,5,6302620740,"This movie is older than me just by a few years, but I Still admire Eddie's classic films and his earlier work. Anyway this is one of Eddie's most underrated movies, It's just as funny as Coming To America, Trading Places, and Harlem Nights. A great cast of actors who were in their prime, Halle,David Alan Grier, Martin Lawrence, and Chris Rock just to name a few. Best performances by Halle Berry, John Witherspoon and Eartha Kitt. Surprisingly enough was that Grace Jones happened to put up a hilarious performance of Helen Strange embarrassing Marcus at the diner scene. The movie had great pacing because there wasn't a single dull moment i could find. Overall very funny movie, great movie to watch with a girlfriend at a home theater or simple television set.",1499212800,,766,4.7669172932330826
493440,4,6302620740,"IMO, the last funny EM film.

I just felt the need to comment how the most critical reviews of this movie at the time of initial release was the absurdity of a corporation managed and employed full of black people.",1499126400,,214,4.35
493441,4,6302620740,"I've been wanting to see this film for a while and I finally got to watch it on Prime. It really is a very nice movie. It showcased many of the Brother and Sisters at the early rise of their acting careers. And It showcased many Melenated  Folks who we liked seeing on film. The story is a romance story but its not too cheesy, its a little raw, its, a little funny, a little sad, a little embarrassing, and yes...a little cheesy.

The soundtrack is exceptional also. It features a good mix of different styles of music performed by folks who are actually talented! And the audio quality is excellent too!

Folks forgot or don't realize how Eddie really did represent the Melenated point of view, and showed and proved his commitment to making cinema with ""Black"" folks fully and well represented.
I'm buying this. That's why I was looking for it, to add it to my permanent movie collection.
 I'm glad it was in prime though. There are not enough ""higher end"" Melenated films offered in Prime. They  have the channel that you can subscribe to, but why do I have to go there to get some of the strong stuff? Feel me now...",1498953600,3,1121,4.422330097087379

  UPC: 8-83929-30381-6
  RELEASED: 2002-09-24

TITLE:  Boomerang (1992)  R  1:56:31
  Eddie Murphy, Robin Givens, Halle Berry, David Alan Grier
  Reginald Hudlin (Director)

  This is, in my opinion, one of Eddie Murphy's funniest movies, by far  with its elegant role reversal of the dog (Eddie Murphy) getting dogged with a taste of his own medicine from she-dog (and, yes, I do know there is another word for a female canine, but it has certain rather negative connotations that don't apply in this instance) Robin Givens. Plus, add young versions of Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence and Tisha Campbell, the surprisingly funny Grace Jones, along with the ageless talent of Eartha Kitt to the mix, and step back and watch the fireworks. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

  See the other reviews for more detail and/or other opinions regarding the plot of the movie.

VIDEO:  1.78:1  Color  480p  MPEG-2 (8.4 Mbps)

  Within the confines of the DVD format (and, I'm sure, because of its SUBSTANTIALLY higher than average bit-rate), this transfer exhibits very-good to frequently excellent picture quality. This film features richly saturated colors, good contrast and very-good shadow detail. In addition, relatively fine detail (for a DVD) is evident in the brighter scenes and in many of the close-ups of actor's faces and their clothing. Also, there are no obvious artifacts such as banding, specks, white dots, hair-lines or color fluctuations to detract from the image. Overall, this movie's presentation on DVD has very good picture quality, and should satisfy all but the pickiest viewers.

AUDIO:  Dolby Digital 5.1 (448 Kbps)

  The audio quality exhibited by the Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack on this DVD, while not a lossless high-definition soundtrack, is an example of what can be accomplished with the format when you put forth the effort  it sounds GREAT! The surround channels were very active and very directional, dialog was cleanly recorded and is natural sounding and is well-placed, and ambient sounds (which were used to convey the location of the on-screen settings and actions) were very effectively integrated into the soundtrack. Also, surprisingly, there are a few (granted, very few) occasions where deep, energetic bass is evident. In addition, the well recorded music (featuring many Soul and R&B hits from the time period) sounds fantastic  as it is utilized very effectively in the front AND surround channels. This is a very fine example of cinematic sound design, particularly for a romantic comedy, which should satisfy all but the very pickiest of listeners.

493638,3,6302620740,"Made in 1992 with Eddie Murphy playing swanky advertising executive Marcus Graham, Boomerang presents a time capsule of the era with fashion of the day, and actors and actresses at different stages of their careers. With an overly predictable plot the film benefits more so from the talented personalities and the rare instance of having Murphy, Halle Berry, Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence and many others in one movie.

493734,5,6302620740,This is one of Eddie Murphy's better movies.  There's role reversals.  The people look good and mostly act better.  I thoroughly enjoyed the movie as I'm sure if you like Eddie you will too.,1379116800,,190,4.529411764705882
493735,5,6302620740,"Eddie was so handsome, I'm surprised he didn't make more romantic comedies like this one.  If you haven't seen it, and you've only seen white movies, well, this one is sort of like Mike Nichols' Working Girl but if the latter was told from Harrison Ford's point of view and if he was much more of a player.  But otherwise picture Robin Givens as the beautiful, power-hungry executive that Sigourney Weaver played, and young Halle Berry plays the Melanie Griffith part, right down to Halle looking sort of ordinary and plain (if you can imagine such a thing) and blossoming into a beauty only later on after she wises up to how a girl get s man like Eddie Murphy.  Anyhow maybe Working Girl isn't such a good comparison, because Harrison Ford would have had to have had a whole posse of other hound dogs intent on nothing but carefree bachelor sexgames with pretty girls or actually any female with two legs, and he didn't.  For Marcus (Eddie Murphy) much of the fun of the chase is comparing notes with his best buds David Alan Grier and Tyler (Martin Lawrence), and much of the drama comes from Eddie meeting his match with Jacqueline (Robin Givens) who teaches him a lesson in how a female player can be twice as deadly as the male and she re-sets his heartstrings.

Robin G. is awesomely beautiful in this movie, truly at her peak, and she's made up and dressed to kill.  You can see how even a strong man like Mike Tyson was putty in her hands.  Indeed the movie must have partially ricocheted off Robin's status as the most hated woman in America (at the time), an unfair sobriquet, but it works well for her in this picture.  If you liked her in Head of the Class and in The Women of Brewster Place you will be happy to see she does some Oscar-worthy work here yet alas, she just hasn't had the breaks to win the contested Academy Award for best actress.  Even in this movie, although she was billed above Halle Berry, even she must have seen the way the cards were being dealt by our heavenly father, because Halle's star was on the rise, and hers had nowhere to go but down.  Halle is good in this movie, don't get me wrong, but she's no Robin Givens!

But when you look at the movie now, both Halle Berry and Chris Rock look like teenagers, like teenagers pretending to be stars.  Meanwhile on the other end of the scale, Eartha Kitt and Geoffrey Holder are performing variations on their respective nightclub acts, with their distinctive voices giving rise to the most hilarious TV commercial ever filmed, with Grace Jones as ""Stron-Jay,"" pronounced in the French style.  Jones steals the show every scene she's in, and she's the one who must have brought the gay guys' butts into the movie theaters of 1992, because some of her lines are still outrageous and that TV commercial for her own perfume, well, you have to see it to believe it.  Better than anything in Mad Men that's for sure.  Now if this were a black version of Mad Men Eddie would be Don Draper, Robin Givens Betty Draper, and plain Jane Halle Berry could be Peggy Olson, the secretary who becomes a copywriter, but it's not, and there you are.",1378166400,,3120,4.477954144620811

493790,5,6302620740,"Having more than established himself as a huge comedic success during the 80's Eddie turns his attention here to what might ammount to his first adult oriented comedy. In this film Eddie portrays Marcus,an advertising exec at a big cosmetic company marketing a brand called Lady Eloise,herself played by the late Ertha Kitt. Eloise herself is on the cusp of retiring and Marcus is preparing for her departure all the while pursuing another interest:women. He's definately the ultimate player who always gets the dog angle to his head when an attractive lady catches his eye. He and his buddies,one played by David Allen Grier and the other an overly race concious Martin Lawrence all find Marcus's antics ammusing as he nitpicks over his dates over everything from ones ""jacked up"" feet,whom he left hanging in bed to Lady Eloise who tries,apparently successfully to seduce him. Of course this gets him nowhere as she is only a figurhead. This is pointed out to him by fellow exec Jaquiline,played slyly by Robbin Givens who is basically his female doppelganger and even Marcus is surprised how she continually plays him by standing him up with little apology and gossiping about him at work. Romantic triangles aside there's also the arrival of the new company head Strange' (pronounced Stron-Jay) played by the one and only Grace Jones,a very butt wild and haughty woman who creates some wild laughs as she emmerges from an airlifted crate on a chariot run by men instead of hourses,throws her undergarmets in a mans face and makes a complete fool of Marcus at a dinner after learning of his alleged escapades with Jacquiline. Tired of being humiliated by a turn of chance he soon turns his romantic interest on the genuine,charitable minded Angela (Halle Berry),the former girlfriend of his buddy Tyler. This sets the two apart to a degree as Tyler concerns himself with how Marcus would treat a ""nice girl"" such as Angela and his concerns prove valid as another sexcapade with Jacquiline deeply hurts Angela. In the end Marcus discovers he and Angela have a deeper love and in the end is re-thinking his player ways to be with a decent lady. This film has it's fair share of adult oriented raunchy humor and some good guest appearances by Chris Rock and Geoffrey Holder,whose character Nelson produces a hilariously warped TV spot for Strange's new perfume line due to a distracted Marcus's decision to give him full creative leeway on the project. With all the humor of the film it has a pretty good message in the end about what being a real ladies man means;that you can maintain your masculinity and still treat your lover with due respect. It's an entertaining film I've enjoyed for a long time and a very good feather in Eddie Murphy's cap if I may say so myself.",1271635200,2,2773,4.815513626834382

That is being purely selfish and a sign of pure stupidity. Men like that give a bad name to our gender. I think Marcus deserved more punishment that what he got (getting the tables turned on him).

493799,5,6302620740,"Man has this movie aged well.  Boomerang was crass, raunchy, vulgar and funny as hell to boot. It was Eddie Murphy in top form just the way we like him.

Plot/story: Marcus Graham(Eddie Murphy) is a marketing executive with a player mentality who meets his match with a gorgeous boss by the name of Jacqueline(Robin Givens). Marcus eventually tries to cope after getting p-whipped and played by Jacqueline.

Opinion: Boomerang was funny as hell back then as it is funny now. The interactions between Eddie Murphy, David Alan Grier and Martin Lawrence characters are funny as hell. Grace Jones's character Strange' is a riot. I still lmao at the restaurant scene where Strange' loudly proclaims her favorite part of the female anatomy 20 times in front of everybody. Eartha Kitt's Lady Eloise is a hoot also. John Weatherspoon is just as funny as David Alan Grier's character's father. Boomerang works because it doesnt just rely on the comics being funny alone(like most comedies do). Its material is funny in its raunchiness and the chemistry between everybody works. I would strongly recommend this movie any day over the recent busts that Eddie Murphy has starred in. 5 stars.",1225670400,,1179,4.974619289340102
493800,4,6302620740,"Boomerang was not a huge success for Eddie Murphy, but I think it is a very entertaining film that unfortunately was too racy to appeal to a family humor audience, but not raw enough for the raunchy crowd. As a romantic comedy, it is perfectly adequate, but what really made it entertaining for me were the incredibly talented women.

Legendary Diva Eartha Kitt has done it all. She was born in South Carolina, but she sang and danced her way out of poverty, and by the 50's she had performed with the Katherine Dunham troupe on a European tour, soloed at a Paris night club, and was the toast of the Continent. Orson Welles called her ""the most exciting girl in the world"". Kitt was virtually exiled from the United States after making anti-Viet Nam war statements during a White House luncheon with Lady Bird Johnson in 1968. However, she was welcomed back to the White House by Jimmy Carter who took office in January of 1977. She played Cat Woman #2, after Cat Woman #1, Julie Newmar, on the Batman TV Show. Eartha Kitt was a good friend of actor James Dean. She had a sexy Christmas hit song with ""Santa Baby"". She was a guest on the very first Late Night With Conan O'Brien, and her Raving Diva came out, as she berated the poor Conan as a talentless hack. Her name can be seen on a Marquee in the famous cult film Plan 9 From Outer Space.

In Boomerang, she plays Lady Eloise, the figure head for a cosmetics company. For a lady of 65, she is surprisingly sexy, and she has great legs.

Robin Givens got her start on The Cosby Show, then was on the TV sitcom Head of the Class. Her marriage to heavy weight champion Mike Tyson in 1988 thrust her into the spotlight, but the troubled marriage lasted only a year. On the 28th of January 2004  she accidentally struck an 89-year old woman with her SUV in Miami. That is something she has in common with Halle Berry, who also had a car accident, and was charged with hit and run. Both Halle and Robin also dated Boomerang co-star Eddie Murphy.

In Boomerang, she plays Jacqueline 'Jackie / Jack' Broyer. Murphy's character is a womanizer, a successful ad executive who beds and discards women at an alarming rate. The tag for the movie is ""The player is about to get played."" Jackie gives him a dose of his own medicine when he finds out that due to a merger, she is his new boss. She turns the tables on Marcus, using him for her own pleasure, but keeping him at arm's length when he wants to take the relationship to the next level. In short, she treats him just like he treats all of his conquests. This makes for quite an amusing reversal of fortunes, as when he makes her a romantic dinner, but she wants to watch the Knicks game and drink beer.

Halle Berry is yet another amazing Black woman. She has had her ups and downs. She looked great as Cat Woman but the movie was a catastrophe. She was placed on three years probation and ordered to pay $13,500 in fines and penalties after pleading no contest on May 10, 2000 to a misdemeanor charge of leaving the scene of a traffic accident. The judge also ordered the actress to perform 200 hours of community service and to make restitution as determined by the outcome of civil litigation arising from the February accident when she was driving a rented Chevrolet Blazer and ran a red light and crashed into another car on Sunset Boulevard. She showed great commitment to acting when playing a crack addict in Spike Lee's Jungle Fever. She didn't bathe for days. Halle Berry is the first Black woman to win the Oscar in the lead category for her role in Monster's Ball.

In Boomerang she plays Angela Lewis, a creative woman who quietly steals Marcus' heart, only to have her own heart broken. A sadder but wiser Marcus Graham finally realizes that she is his true love, and struggles to win her back.

I've saved the most outrageous diva for last: Grace Jones plays Helen Strang&eacute;, a model hired to be the face behind a new fragrance. She is very far out there, and she crosses over the line several times. Her scenes are shocking, to say the least. Her first appearance on screen is way over the top. Don't want to spoil it by telling you what happens, but watch out for it. She really puts the 'boom' in Boomerang. There is a great scene where she storms off and hops in a cab set to the music of her own hit, ""Pull Up to the Bumper.""

Eddie Murphy shows a lot of range, though he only plays one character in this one. He is a charming player, a dog, really, but he has a sensitive side. He thinks he is all that, yet he doesn't really take himself too seriously:

Marcus Graham: Check it. Like Jet magazine. This is my mack daddie vibe I am giving you. In all its splendor.

He is given ample support by sidekicks, Tyler and Gerard, played by Martin Lawrence and David Alan Grier respectively. John Witherspoon and Bebe Drake also shine as uncouth country parents who embarrass the nerdy Gerard:

Mr. Jackson: I bet we've eaten everything on a pig from the rooter to the tooter.

Chris Rock plays Bony T, who is trying to work his way up from the mail room:

Bony T: Hey Marcus, I been working here about 8 days, been on time most of the time even when it rains. Don't you think it's about time we talk promotion?

Last but not least, Geoffrey Holder is Nelson, a commercial director whose slogan should be sex sells, but who has to be carefully watched lest he go too far. Nelson would be the kind of director who would have thought of the 'wardrobe malfunction' when Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake performed for the Super Bowl Halftime show.

Holder is from Trinidad, and besides being an actor, he is also an award winning choreographer, costume designer, and director. He is the 6'6"" tall bald man with the hearty laugh most familiar as the Uncola Man in soda commercials from the 70's and 80's. Upon winning the best-director Tony Award in 1975, he said in his acceptance speech, ""Just try making that out of a cola nut!""

493813,4,6302620740,"Okay, so everyone knows/remembers Eddie Murphy went into the 1990s on a roll:

--Trading Places

--Beverly Hills Cop

--BHC II

--Coming to America

--Harlem Nights

All of those were blockbuster movies, hilarious, appealing to wide, mainstream audiences and well-deserving of all the praise and $$$ he made off those films.

In my opinion, 1992's ""Boomerang"" was the last great film Eddie Murphy did and one of the good things about this movie is that it's a comedy nothing like Murphy's prior work.

Viewers who like funny, twist-ending kind of romantic comedies will really get into this film.

Without giving away too much of the plot, I'll just say the gist of this movie is that for all the men (playas, pimps, dawgs) out there that one-night stand, wam-bam-thank-you-ma'am women who are fooled into thinking they've hit a relationship jackpot, ""Boomerang"" turns the tables.

Eddie Murphy stars as ""Marcus"" an executive in an advertising firm chasing foil ""Jacqueline"" played by Robbin Givens.

As the two eventually hookup and do the damn thang (wink, wink), Marcus falls in love with Jacqueline who plays him.

A long, dirty-laundry list of hilarious events ensue afterward when once Marcus ""gets played"" and finds himself enduring several of the indignities, inhumanities and out and out disrespectful treatment from the opposite sex he was guilty of treating in these same fashions.

This is one of the gender roles, turning-the-tables-to-see-how men-like-it-when-the-shoes-on-the-other-foot kind of romantic comedies.

This came out my freshman year of high school and everyone I knew loved it and totally got what the point of what this movie was trying to say about (then) modern relationships in dating.

Bit parts for Halle Berry, Lela Rochonn, Tisha Campbell, Grace Jones and Eartha Kitt make this movie probably the sexiest for some of the industry's sexiest women!!!!

Not a movie little kids will relate to, but preteens through any adult that's got ""stories to tell"" about odd relationships they've had will really enjoy this picture.

And just remember this was one of Halle's first big movies before her career took off ... worth watching just to notice the difference(s).

Highly recommended.",1142899200,2,2215,5.2266288951841355
493814,5,6302620740,"How can you not love Boomerang and better yet why isn't it being recognized as a classic. Eddie isn't just funny he also showed off his talent to be a good actor. You don't just get a comedy you get an interesting film about the life of a man who didn't know what he had until he lost it. You get a movie about a man who thought he was a real playa until he met not only his equal but also a woman on an entirely different level. Robin Givens kills her character and puts the fear of god into men by letting them know that women do what we can do and do it better. Halle Berry digs in as the beautiful girl that falls in love with a man that loves a girl that's playing him but he doesn't realize he had something just as good waiting for him until the end.

To be truthful not only does Eddie get played he gets outshined by these two beautiful actresses and can't really catch up. The funniest thing has to be John Witherspoon playing David Allen Greer's father and he shows you the reason why we never want to bring our girlfriends around our parents. Boomerang is a classic and can't be given anything under five stars because it's just done so smooth. So if your looking for a good love and comedy flick then this is definitely what you need.",1141776000,3,1247,4.131687242798354
493815,5,6302620740,"This is the best film of its kind ever made and personally my favourite movie ever. It is very underrated. Everyone wants to know how attraction works between men and women, and guess what?this film is like a universal manual just for that.

The detail that is explored here in comtemporary dating is phenominal, the research was clearly very well sourced and accurate down to even facial expressions. Eddie clearly demonstrates that he is a real-life player by the fine and almost coincidental acting performance he offers. Comically, Eddie was naturally Eddie here, and the bouncing between Alan Grier and Lawrence was convincing as they tried to depict three childhood friends.

The casting was amazing.. Eddie Murphy, Halle Berry, John Witherspoon, Martin Lawrence, David Alan Grier, Robin Givens, Chris Rock and someone who always always goes unmentioned Lela Rochon!!!. Lela is a very good actor and is also the prettiest and sexiest woman in the flick. Why other people don't pick up on this is completely beyond me.

Bottom-line is that people just aren't making films like this anymore, with the magic and style that Hudlin conjures. Others like ""two can play that game"" and ""the best man"" or ""the brothers"" are very very poor when stood up against Boomerang. The best thing would be a sequel to this movie with original cast, as it really is the best mix between comedy, education, & love issues. The only people I believe could pull it off are Reginald himself, John Singleton or maybe Martin Lawrence as a director (thin line between love and hate).",1132617600,,1561,4.927756653992396
493816,5,6302620740,"Besides painting a satisfying portrait of ""upwardly mobile profesional black Americans,"" ""Boomerang"" is an appealing look at the oft-times amusing and tumultuous struggle between the sexes.  Eddie Murphy, who served as producer, is wonderful as the ""player"" who gets his comeupance from a female equal, in the well-proportioned form of Robin Givens.

A stellar cast that features legends Eartha Kitt and Geoffrey Holder, then up-and-comers Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence, and a pre-Oscar Halle Berry, established performers like Lela Rochon, Tisha Campbell, and David Allen Grier, and an over-the-top Grace Jones makes this a classic in the truest sense of the term.

Watch the film with director Reginald Hudlin's commentary.  He provides colorful insight into the pivotal use of New York locations, costuming, casting concerns, the importance of background music, film economics, and unintentional social commentary.  Many times the director's ""chat"" is dull; that cannot be said for the words of this talented young man.

""Boomerang,"" like the word implies, is a film that warrants ""return"" visits.",1119139200,5,1098,5.5843373493975905
493817,4,6302620740,"Simply put, Eddie Murphy has made some critical errors in judgement with films.  This is an exception.  A grown up comedy with wit, style, grace, and even some class to boot.  An all-star cast (Martin Lawerence, Robin Givens, Halle Barry, David Allen Grier, Eartha Kitt, and a very, very young Chris Rock) highlight a well written, well directed comedy that has heart and soul.  Also features a great soundtrack.",1114992000,,412,4.927536231884058
493818,4,6302620740,"Eddie Murphy stars in this romantic comedy as a ""player"" who often brags to his two best buddies (played by David Alan Grier and Martin Lawrence) about his conquests. However, he meets his match when he falls for a workplace beauty (played by Robin Givens), who pretty much treats him the exact same way he treats his conquests. The strange thing about this film is that, in the beginning, when we see Murphy using all of these women, we start to think, ""this guy is a no-good dog, and deserves to get a taste of his own medicine."" However, when he finally *does* get a taste of his own medicine, we start to feel a little sad for him.

In this flick, you can also find such appearances from Grace Jones, John Witherspoon and Halle Berry, who plays the platonic friend of Murphy's character when he is down-in-the-dumps. This is a hilarious film, which should provide many with large doses of entertainment.",1107388800,13,907,4.598765432098766
493819,4,6302620740,"Boomerang is a good film. Eddie Murphy is at the top of his game here, and the Hudlin Brothers fresh off ""House Party"" do a good job writing and producing their second film. Unfortunately, what make the movie fall flat are the lackluster performances of the supporting cast. Even though it's not as good as the Classic Beverly Hills Cop or Coming To America, it's still one of my favorite movies.

Eddie Murphy is great as Marcus the womanizing executive. He's a dog who is soon to have his day when he runs afoul of Robin Givens. Sadly, this is where the story starts to fall apart. Murphy and Givens just don't have the onscreen chemistry to make this romantic comedy work. That's not Robin Givens fault at all. One of biggest flaws of Boomerang is the screenplay and its poorly written female characters. None of the actresses had anything to work with here, since most of the female characters were extremely underdeveloped. With a stronger script I think Robin Givens would have been able to hold her own with Murphy. Halle Berry is sweet here as the office good girl who helps Marcus change his misogynistic ways. David Alan Grier is the ""Nice Guy"" and Marin Lawrence is hilarious stealing every scene he's in. It's a shame the story gets lost in all the stargazing, because it truly is a great premise.

That's the other weak spot Boomerang has: the Casting. There are just too many stars here and that prevents the viewer from seeing the characters in the story. For all you stargazers, there are appearances by Lela Rochon, Tisha Campbell, John Witherspoon, Geoffrey Holder, (7up man for you 80's kids) Grace Jones, Chris Rock, and Ertha Kitt. And that's the main problem here with Boomerang: No one blends seamlessly into the background of the film and becomes characters the way the supporting actors did in Coming To America. Worse, because there is no synergy among the actors onscreen most of the performances of the supporting cast are flat and uninspired. No one shares any chemistry with Eddie Murphy or each other onscreen. Everybody seems to be just doing ""Their Thing."" I remember watching this film in the theatres back in 1992 and most of the audience was pointing their fingers at the screen calling out actor names. That really ruined the movie for me back then.

I think Boomerang had the potential to be a true classic. With a little tweaking to the screenplay and some unknowns cast in some of the smaller supporting roles this film could have actualized the potential of the wonderful premise. With it's flaws, it's still a wonderful movie that shows what a group of talented African-American filmmakers, producers and actors can do if given an opportunity to make a movie.",1103760000,,2701,4.754797441364605
493820,4,6302620740,"Based on a story about an urban metrosexual player , who gets burned ( broken hearted )by a woman who uses the same tricks that he does to women , is a turning stone , for Eddie Murphy's film career. This is a transitional film. It's funnier than Eddie Murphy's latest roles. But it's not as funny as his earlier ones ( Trading Places , 48 hrs. , Coming to America , ect.. ). Atleast not , on his part. However , his "" downplayed"" performance , helped Chris Rock's, Martin Lawrence's, Robin Given's , David Allen Grier's , and Hally Berry's performances, stand out. Eddie Murphy is so instinctively funny , that I believe he intentionally made an effort to water down and tame his character. Either, due to his attempt at becoming a ""serious"" actor or internalizing his parenthood respnsibilites by consciously making an effort to change his image , accepting his role as a leading , visible black actor. Pick your own choice , as to why ...but there's no denying that he could've been funnier. However , on a contrasting level...his acting has never been better , up to that point."" Boomerang"" marked the maturing of Eddie. The young , daring , over the top, juvenile, and flamboyant comic died , in this film. The budding , mature , comedic , actor , replaced him. Plain and simple. ""Boomerang"" isn't a great film. However, it's a respectable one. And the addition of young and up coming actors , make this a memorable film. Great soundtrack and direction. The script is good also. But when you mix that with obvious scenes of improv from creative actors/actresses....it only gets better. I recommend this for any Eddie Murphy fan. But if you only like the early SNL Murphy...you'd be better off getting the Murphy films , made, previous to this one. And seek some counseling..because you're obviously incapable of change.

The cinemetography is beautiful...Everyone looks great, sets, costumes, all of it...well done.  And the characters are not caricatures of how Black people ""act"" in the corporate world , in love or just living life.  Eddie's playboy character truly gets his just rewards by way of Ms. Givens well acted character, Jacqueline Boyers. She goes for what she wants, (in life and in romance) gets it and moves on if it gets too intimate.  (How stereotypically male of her LOL!)  I actually liked her in this, her work wasn't forced or overly smug as she usually can be.

It is a fun film, so many great cameos and characters.  Grace Jone's scene in the restaurant and actually all of her scenes are hysterical. Geoffrey Holder and Eartha Kitt? absolute Gems!
Like Coming to America, I think Murphy hit on something that AFrican AMerican viewers have always looked for in Tv and film...non caricatured treatment of the kinds of stories that all lovers of film  want to experience and enjoy.  Ten years later, with films like Brown Sugar, Love and Basketball

I watched this movie because it was rip-roaring funny, subtley race-conscious, and because the sistahs were Phhhine, slammin, and the brothers were educated, cultured, and well-spoken (except for the Martin Lawrence character, but he was great too).  In other words, it felt great watching buppies (black yuppies) on film, with not a finacial care in the world.  They looked great in corporate America making artistic decisions, swinging business deals, deciding to quit their jobs on principle and FIND themselves--wow.  The vicarious pleasure was almost too much for me.  Now add all that to some of the funniest comedic material ever and you have a classic.  Every scene is a gem.

Supportingly, Grace Jones as Strange was phenominal  as she, without effort dominates every scene that she's in.  The boardroom  and restaurant scenes are two of the most unforgettable scenes in cinema  history.
Other characters to note:  Halle Berry as Angela Lewis (who  writes Marcus a reality check), Chris Rock as Bony-T, Eartha Kitt as Lady  Eloise, Martin Lawrence and David Allen Grier as Marcus's homeboys,  Geoffrey Holder as ""Nasty Nelson"" and Lela Rochon as one of  Marcus's ""dates"" (with bad toes).

This film was the second on the T-120 tape. While I consider Coming to America to be a classic in my opinion, I also must note how great Boomerang is. It too has many fine performances.

Eddie Murphy is the man I wish I could be! He's good-looking, has a great job, an apartment in Manhattan and is blessed with the abilities to seduce all kinds of beautiful females. Some of those women end up hating him for life while others only end up desiring him forever. Robin Givens and Halle Berry are at their best in this film. Both shine and both more than hold their own with Murphy, a veteran of film by the time this movie was made. This film is really a dramedy. It has drama and comedic moments that hold true today. For instance, the racist salesman's reactions to three African Americans in the high end store is a riot! But Murphy's response to his ignorance is even more funny.

I recommend this film. I give it Four and a Half Stars out of Five. Buy it and you won't be disappointed.",1520467200,,1125,4.252336448598131
