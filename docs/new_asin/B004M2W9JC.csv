8435430,4,B004M2W9JC,"Stick with Seasons 1-3.  They are as good as TV gets.  However, the Christmas specials are nowhere near as good.  They feel forced and have none of the magic of the earlier episodes. They should have stopped after Season 3.",1520553600,,223,4.525

If you love British humor you will love this. Great

Highly recommended.",1403481600,2,173,4.4375
8435434,5,B004M2W9JC,"When it first hit the screen, the Royle Family was a comedy unlike all that had been before it. It quickly became a classic in its own right. With a very different style, it is quite possible that its different format and realism may not be understood by some, in the same way that Last of the Summer Wine's gentle comedy may be seen by some as dull or pedestrian, when it's one of the best comedies of all time. Maybe you just have to be from up north, but given the popularity of both, clearly it has a wide appeal - at least within the British Isles.
It's not fast moving. It rarely leaves the Royles sitting room. It does go to the kitchen sometimes.  It's very close to real life. And it's responsible for some moments of comedic genius that rank up there with the best. While not wishing to spoil it for those who have never seen the show, all I can say is the rendition of Mambo No. 5 is up there with Morecambe and Wise's 'Stripper' sketch, and when Grandma inadvertently gets a touch of gas, is a moment of genius.  As are Jim's teasing of the neighbour's weight issues, or his cynical observations on, well just about everything from the son-in-law to the government, the neighbours to close friend Twig. Yes, it helps to have grown up in the UK to get some of the humour. But it's one of the most original, funny shows ever to see the light of day on the BBC. There are a couple of episodes that are a bit more Corrie than they are comedy, but the rest is so well written and acted that the occasional drama can be forgiven.
For Royle Family devotees, this compilation has everything. Which is a little reminiscent of Dave's questioning of Twig, when they are discussing satellite television. Again, another classic, understated moment where the obvious is simply funny. It's not slapstick, and it's not a series of fast-paced sketches. It's how funny family life can be, with a cast of wonderful characters from the hapless and hopeless Dave to the bickering brother and lazy sister, who almost certainly gets her drive from her wise-cracking dad, Jim, who has a love-hate relationship with his hard-of-hearing mother-in-law that's 99 percent sarcasm and disbelief and one percent affection. Maybe.
Being from northern England and being a devotee of all things Britcom (with one or two notable exceptions), it is impossible to give this anything other than five stars, in spite of the occasional dip in quality. Oh, and a reminder that this is a Region 2 DVD that will only play on a region-free DVD, but the good news is you can order one right here on Amazon for less than the price of this DVD set. The region-free DVD is essential if you want to watch this, and this is essential if you want some classic, but unusual, British comedy with writing of the highest quality.",1363564800,6,2786,4.525793650793651
8435435,1,B004M2W9JC,"Such great British stars, and all they do is ""sit 'round the tele"".  Clearly, this is what the social welfare state breeds.  ""American Idol"", ""Survivor"", etc. present a mirror to the viewer....""The Royle Family"".  I understand British comedy, but this is like British sarcasm at the lazy people on the public dole.  Maybe that's why it was the #19 British Sitcom.  It ISN'T very funny...unless you want to laugh at the people that elect our representatives and watch such tripe.

Look for the stars in other things like ""Keeping Up Appearances"", ""Clatterford"", etc.",1309392000,2,565,5.021505376344086
