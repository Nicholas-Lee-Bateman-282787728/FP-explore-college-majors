They were often just ludicrous, which proved too distracting for me to keep track of what was actually happening on the screen. I got really, really frustrated, then irritated. During some of the more interesting scenes, my brain was  occupied with trying to translate the bad subtitles to language that was more appropriate to the nature of the characters and of the film.  Argh!  I wish I understood enough Hindi so I didn't need a translation.  The other Bollywood movies I've seen so far have had excellent subtitles, and it didn't even seem like I was reading translations, they merged so well.",1331596800,,770,4.892307692307693
8438090,3,B004QFS4RG,"n the film an NRI doctor played by Madhavan comes to India to find a bride. He decides to get engaged to Kangna Ranaut who is hell bent on not getting married to him. She wants to get married to her lover, played by Jimmy Shergil. She is a complete opposite of what a Indian bride should be, she smokes, drinks and is a loud mouth.
This should have made for a very interesting film and in parts it is but although the director Anand Rai finds a good subject, he somehow manages to mangle and mess it up. There are several scenes which bring a smile to your face but it only because of Madhavan who is wonderful as the hapless doctor, infatuated with the unattainable women. He keeps it together. The rest of the cast are strictly mediocre. Kangna Ranaut sparkles in scenes but she tries to play the uncouth bride with too much intensity. Deepak Dobriyal as Madhavans pal is superb and Jimmy Shergil is wasted. The movie has one of the best songs of the year, Yun Hi sung by the velvet voiced Mohit Chauhan. This tune alone is one of the best things about the film. Overall a decent watch.
