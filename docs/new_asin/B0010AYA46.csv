8237588,5,B0010AYA46,"This is the last word in Choctaw vids. I remember learning about a casino and there was dancing and music too. The Choctaw are a very complex people with a rich history and this exhaustive 12 minute vid peels away that history generation-by-generation and almost moment-by-moment, like a blooming onion from the app menu at Outback Steakhouse. I would highly recommend this vid to anyone that is interested in the Choctaw people or just great vids in general.",1361836800,,459,4.897435897435898
