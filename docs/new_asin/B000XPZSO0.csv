8229088,5,B000XPZSO0,"This is a very sweet and funny movie. The actors are likable, and I really enjoyed the relationship between Martin and Russell. This is an independent movie that was made awhile ago and flew under the radar. Definitely worth watching!",1488672000,,234,4.875

8229090,4,B000XPZSO0,"I heard about this from a friend who saw it at a film festival and thought it was funny.  A small budget  sort of road trip comedy about two dumb guys trying to do whatever they can to win back their lost loves. Definitely worth a rental, if you can find it. As far as independent movies go, it's well done with a lot of laugh out-loud stuff.",1360022400,2,342,4.014705882352941
