3005005,5,B000XPZHN2,"In 20 minutes I received 10 simple steps to correct undesired behavior!  As a busy Mom I don't have time to read a couple hundred pages of a parenting guide.  I LOVE this simple 10 step program and it really works.  Don uses real life examples that occur every day in my household.  I was able to quickly watch this DVD and implement some of these fabulous techniques with my five year old.  We now have a calmer more direct mode of communication, both of our behavior is more positive & everyone is much happier!  Thank You Don!!",1203552000,4,530,4.357142857142857
3005006,5,B000XPZHN2,"WOW!!! Finally a video that takes all that psycho babble and puts things in laymen's terms.

Every Parent and even non-parent need to buy this dvd. I'm a martial arts instructor with a degree in Psychology with a behavior emphasis that has been using behavioral techniques with our students and staff alike for years. I was sooo impressed at the ease Don has taken in developing such a comprehensive tool that anyone can understand. I've only had the DVD for less than 24 hours and have already watched it 3 times and have already told my staff, sister, friends and student parents they need to get this dvd.

Thank you Don for a tool that will change lives!!! I've already implemented mandatory staff training to help my instructors in the classroom and will continue to tell every parent I meet about your program.

You Rock!!! When's the next DVD coming out?",1203465600,3,861,4.688741721854305

8229065,5,B000XPZHN2,"I think everyone should have to have some child rearing education.  I always here how parents do it differently with child #2 and child #3 - they learned on the job.
I wanted a little cheat sheet so that I could start early with child #1.
This video was so easy to watch and so easy to understand.
It's not as much disciplining as it is giving information to your children and creating expectations through that information.
When we sat to watch the video, my husband said, ""makes perfect sense.""
We have used the tips successfully ever since.",1229990400,,543,4.540816326530612
