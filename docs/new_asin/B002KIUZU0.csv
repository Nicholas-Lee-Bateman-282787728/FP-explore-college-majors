3940851,5,B002KIUZU0,"I didn't realize people this incredible existed.  While most kids doodle designs of boats and planes, Karl actually followed through with his childhood dream and built not one but two functioning submarines by hand!  Whether you're into the amazing footage of 6-gilled sharks or the story of how Karl got to where he is today, it's definitely a must see!",1254009600,3,354,4.883333333333334
3940852,5,B002KIUZU0,Awesome!!!!  For less than the price of some crappy drinks at a crappy bar you will be intoxicated by this documentary.  You will want to grab your old Dacor dive gear and do your best Jacque Cousteau impersonation.  Just don't touch the sea anemone.  I accidently found out about this documentary just goofing around on the internet.  Then I read an article in Outside Magazine.  I patiently waited for the documentary to be released and I was not disappointed.  If this documentary does not spark your inner explorer maybe crappy drinks in a crappy bar are your thing.,1253750400,6,570,4.755102040816326
3940853,5,B002KIUZU0,"This film is awesome. Incredible footage of deep ocean creatures. The fact that this guy built his own submarine and is going 2,000 feet into the ocean is proof that if you put your mind to it, you can do anything.",1253577600,,214,4.2439024390243905
3940854,5,B002KIUZU0,I purchased this movie about a month ago and I must say it was one of the greatest Documentary / film I have ever laid eyes on. Paulie Dinatale is a GENIUS!,1252540800,,156,3.90625
3940855,5,B002KIUZU0,"This documentary stands out on its own just by the incredible underwater film but that is not what captured me. What is incredible is that a person, with no formal training, can design and build their own sub. This movie is about a dreamer who does not know he can't do something. As I followed his story through the movie I began to think about what dreams I had that I thought were ""impossible."" This in an inspiring story and what better place to fulfill a dream than under the beautiful waters off the tropical island of Roatan.",1249948800,4,532,4.438775510204081
8372030,5,B002KIUZU0,Awesome dive with Karl Stanley in the Idabel!,1520553600,,45,4.75
8372031,5,B002KIUZU0,"Very interesting movie. I heard about this guy from a friend who lived in Roatan and decided to buy the movie. I, myself, am a diver and would love to build my own submersible. It's very inspiring that his family supported him to such an extent. I don't know too many families who'd allow their kid to quit school and fund them to build a submersible in the garage.",1416614400,,365,4.304347826086956
8372032,5,B002KIUZU0,"Dove with Karl last year and loved every ft of our trip with him!  Watching this DVD after meeting him was even more of a treat!!  He is a simple man, with a huge love of the sea!  To meet him was funny, he seems such an ordinary guy, soft spoken, a bit aloof and yet, the ideas that must be going through his head probably run faster than a freeway!  Everyday, tinkering with this and that with the sub and you know he is working out more details for another sub in the future!!  This is his baby and it shows in all his hard work and attention to detail!  I felt comfortable and totally safe and secure in the belly of Idabel :)  Can't wait to go back for our next adventure with them!",1413158400,,687,4.007352941176471
8372033,5,B002KIUZU0,"This was a very frank short movie about Karl. He is definitely a unique person and that is the center of the movie. If you look closely will see how Idabel has morfed a bit over the years. I believe Karl is in the planning stages for his next sub. If you have any doubts about diving in Idabel, don't let it stop you. Go dive! Seeing the world at 2,000 ft. is unbelievable. There is so much life. Karl does some amazing piloting of Idabel. You are only feet away from the rocks and abundant life. This beats any trip you could imagine of flying to the moon.",1391558400,,557,4.1192660550458715
8372034,5,B002KIUZU0,"An excellent film about a controversial character and his submersible. I know the next time I go diving in Roatan, Honduras I will take the 1500 to 2000 foot dive",1389052800,,162,4.433333333333334
8372035,5,B002KIUZU0,"Good film about a guy with a great and unique business.
Good if you are interested in personal submarines and aquatic adventure.
Pro seller with fast shipping.",1272240000,,159,4.925925925925926
8372036,4,B002KIUZU0,"""A View From Below"" explores the obsessive drive that led the young American, Karl Stanley, to begin construction on a homemade submarine in his backyard when he was just 14-years old.  At the age of 24, he began taking tourists on deep water expeditions from Roatan Island, off the coast of Honduras - sometimes going as deep as 2600 feet.  Undeterred by those who argue that only professionally-designed and certified submarines can possibly be safe, Karl created a unique underwater craft that allows him and his passengers to get up close and observe fascinating and in many cases undocumented deep sea creatures.  His long track record, he argues, and his careful attention to the safety of his craft, more than makes up for his refusal to subject his submarine to the prohibitively expensive regulations of the professional certifying bodies - even while he insists that he is aware of the regulations and adheres to most of them.

The film is beautifully shot and presents a range of perspectives on Karl and his work - the opinions of other professionals in his field, those who know him well and those who find him to be a strange character.  It doesn't have the feel, though, of a merely informational television video - gorgeous undersea imagery, and impressive visuals dominate over talking-head style interviews.  Plus, the interviews are interesting and above all Karl is a fascinating man, whose passion and drive is both inspiring and yet appears to border on obsession.  Watching him, though, it's hard to imagine a better life than one in which an unbridled devotion to dreams fulfills itself in a satisfying way of life.

I couldn't help but wonder, for a moment, what Werner Herzog might have done with this material -- since Karl strikes me as exactly the type of person Herzog likes to investigate in some of his documentary works (like Dieter Dengler in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Dieter-Needs-to-Fly/dp/B000M7FO0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Dieter Needs to Fly</a>&nbsp;or  Timothy Treadwell in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grizzly-Man/dp/B000BMY2NS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grizzly Man</a>).  In some cases the film's take on Karl may have been excessively literal, and didn't go far enough for what Herzog calls ""ecstatic truth,"" but might have.  There are moments - as when Karl discusses the occasion when his parents sent him to a strict boarding school in order to curb his impulsiveness, and his lingering resentment betrays itself.  Or when, on a submarine dive, Karl tells his passenger that Bugsy committed suicide over a woman by diving too deep -- and then, to the passenger's surprise and ours, he reveals a skeleton in diving gear as Bugsy himself.  Or when a gigantic shark, larger than the submarine, circles in slowly and devours meat that Karl had attached to his craft.  I did like the balance in emphasis between the person and the undersea he explored, and think it wouldn't have been as strong a film if the filmmakers had chosen to make it more about the underwater explorations than about the man who made them possible.

Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in the ocean, or who ever had a dream and let it die because they were told or felt that it couldn't possibly be practical.",1266883200,,3350,5.29433962264151
8372037,4,B002KIUZU0,"I've been waiting for the availability of this DVD since before February of 2009 when my wife and I dove with Karl Stanley to 2000 ft in his submarine Idabel.  This film does an excellent job of both telling the story of Karl Stanley and his submarines, and also showing what a dive on the Idabel can be like.  Deciding to dive with Karl requires a personal risk/reward assessment and this DVD (in addition to the numerous articles that have been written about Karl) is an excellent resource for making that decision.  As a documentary film, it is informative and entertaining.  The editing is excellent, with neither too much nor too little time devoted to any single aspect of the film.  Technically, the video and audio is also completely professional.  As scuba divers and naturalists, the absolute highlights of the film for my wife and I were the incredible fish and other sea creatures that are found only at these depths.  While we saw some of these on our dive with Karl, the majority of them we had only previously seen in still photos, if at all.  As Karl points out, there's a vast, mostly unexplored world down there.  We would have preferred more such footage, but understand that this film isn't meant to be solely a nature documentary.  Karl has done what few have even attempted.  This is his story.  And this DVD tells that story very well.",1265068800,2,1358,4.635983263598327
8372038,5,B002KIUZU0,"I thought for a couple months about writing this review.

I waited months for this video to be released because I had known about a sub on Roatan Island south  of Honduras mainland.  I was too cheap to admit interest in going on his sub.  When I came back to the States I read and watched and looked at everything I could find about Karl Stanley and his sub, the glorious creatures I had missed seeing. I have the indescribable feeling that I might have done something really exciting in my life if I had just paid the money and taken the ride.  I still don't know exactly where on Roatan he is but I am pretty sure it is near where the collectivos( public vans)  first enter West End.  I wish I had known that then.  I never even got to see the sub.

Some day I will go back .  Karl Stanley will be my first stop. Buying this video is a great investment.  For $12 you can see a little of what would cost $500,$800,$1200 (per person).He only takes 2 passengers and he can go down 2500 feet in about a 4 foot sub and visit 20 foot prehistoric sharks.

YOU have a choice to buy the movie on Amazon.com before or after you go to Roatan to visit Karl Stanley. You can also visit Stanley Submarine web page.  I hope his previous customers get word of this video. They would be jealous of us.",1255737600,2,1286,4.137096774193548
8372039,5,B002KIUZU0,"Karl Stanley is an amazing man with an incredible passion for underwater exploration. His remarkable energy and enthusiasm will make you realize that even your biggest dreams are not impossible to reach. After watching this movie, you will want to jump into his sub and see the mind-blowing view from below yourself (which is possible if you pay him a visit in Roatan).",1254009600,2,369,4.873015873015873
