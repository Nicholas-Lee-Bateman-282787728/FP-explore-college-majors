7994971,5,B0000A0DUP,"If you like sideshow acts then you really should buy this video.

I'm pretty jaded and thought I'd seen pretty much everything but there were acts on this DVD that amazed me.

The extra video of Lucifire was absolutely mind blowing....just wait till you see what she does with fire.",1270598400,,282,4.62
7994972,4,B0000A0DUP,"This DVD is short, 49 minutes long, and dated, coming to us from 2003. Hardly an ""inside"" look at the Sideshow/Freak phenomenon, it's an entertaining snapshot of where this phenomenon was in 2003. The names have changed, the venues have changed, the acts have mutated (if you will), Jim Rose is running a Vegas-style variety show with little ""freak"" appeal, and a few real freak shows, such as the 999 Eye Freak Show out of Austin, are starting to come back with a twist: caberet-style singing freaks; but that shouldn't stop the viewer from finding this little featurette an entertaining one.",1262649600,3,593,4.881188118811881
