8236961,1,B000JUBF28,I am very disappointed in this DVD.  I was expecting a movie not clips from the news media. It is a poorly done production and lacks quality.  Generic for sure. You can hardly hear the narrator as the music over powers the voice. Where's the story line? I found it hard to follow and that it would not be a good witnessing tool. It would be very confusing to a non-believer. I've seen better productions by high school students. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS DVD as I've seen other productions regarding the Alpha & Omega that gave a very clear message.,1253750400,,550,4.435643564356436
