5656022,1,B00BMXT8BQ,Just Don't lol... and the verbal vomit I am writing is only to fill the required word count for a review,1374192000,,104,4.0
5656023,1,B00BMXT8BQ,"I skipped the ten minutes of credits, caught the opening, the strip club and the cheesy ending.  Even the music was bad. What I can not believe is that someone got a credit for the pentagram artwork.",1373846400,,199,4.378378378378378
5656024,4,B00BMXT8BQ,"I have read some of the reviews and actually cannot believe what I was reading. I know people are entitled to their own opinion.  I purchased this movie via itunes first and then purchased a blue ray copy (even though I don't own a blue ray). I watched this movie on my own and I was a bit freaked out. But freaked out in a good way. I get scared at some of these types of movies and that is why I won't watch them. I was on the edge of my seat during some parts. I absolutely LOVE the music in this movie. This is what made me buy the tracks from itunes.  Little bit different side of Slam Bang but I love them. I really liked the cameo appearances in the movie as well. To me this is a different type of horror film and anything that has to do with Satain scares me anyway.  SGL love you guys, great job.  I look forward to the next one.",1372636800,,839,3.9176470588235293
5656025,5,B00BMXT8BQ,"This movie is a departure from your typical Vampire movie. The growth of the characters and the interaction was captivating. When it was over I found myself wanting more of the story. Cinematography was excellent, soundtrack was awesome. Highly recommend for those that don't want to watch just another vampire move.",1372464000,3,316,5.215686274509804
5656026,1,B00BMXT8BQ,"I don't think I made it even 10 full minutes into this godawful piece of dreck. The actors convey about as much emotion as a slice of moldy cheese. I hope they didn't get paid for their ""performances"" because if they did, the studio got ripped off. Worse yet, paying them would only encourage them to continue ""acting."" I'd rather put my eyes out with a sharpened stick than watch these losers again. And for the record, I'm a fan of several amateur series that appear on YouTube--and they're all better acted than this little slice of cinematic torment. In all honesty, I can't speak to the quality of the screenplay or plot since I couldn't watch the damned thing past the first few minutes, but I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that it probably sucked, too, because a good screenplay should have at least drawn the financial backing to hire someone other than high school dropouts found on a street corner as stars. Don't even waste more of your time reading this review--even this is more than ""Jezebeth"" is worth. Just go find a decent movie to watch.",1371945600,,1058,4.515625
5656027,4,B00BMXT8BQ,"I thought I would take a chance on this movie despite some of the harsh reviews. And, I'm glad I did. Not a Bad movie. I can't believe some of the bad reviews on this film, although I noticed that some of the ""Bad"" Reviews used the Directors name Damien Dante as if they may know him. This is actually a very Cool Vampire Film. The story kept me intrigued, and although the acting is a little low budget at times, Bree Michaels who plays Jezebeth is HOT and Delivers on every front. Lot's of Hot Vampire Babes, Gratuitous Nudity and The Soundtrack is Amazing... I'm glad I decided to Watch this Movie despite the harsh reviews!!! Definitely worth the watch!!!",1371859200,,659,4.454545454545454
5656028,1,B00BMXT8BQ,"Yeah, seriously, horribly & ridiculously awful.  After watching 1/2 the opening credits, I jumped around to see if it would prove to be something more than I would expect from an 8th-grader's flip camera.  It did not.

But if you're wondering what a ""flip camera"" is, have a looky:

5656029,5,B00BMXT8BQ,"I first saw Jezebeth at the Portage theatre in Chicago. I never saw a vampire movie this wild. I mean, there's a cemetery scene where a girl get's bitten on her butt, very graphic. Torture scene with candles and another torture scene with the help of a hammer. A demonic guitar solo performed by Jezebeth. This movie had a ton of music in it, like a vampire musical in a way. Then I bought Jezebeth on a 4 pack dvd called ""Superpack Vampires"" and the hi-def picture quality and the 5.1 surround sound kicked my ass.

Okay, I know this movie isn't ""Gone with the Wind"" but the director got this right. Finally a vampire movie with a new vision. And I can't wait for the next one. Jezebeth 2 Hour of the Gun.",1362873600,2,706,4.268656716417911
5656060,1,B00BMXT8BQ,"what do a rental house, a cemetery, and a strip joint have in common?...this nonsensical witch/vampire movie attempted to string a story by filming entirely in those three places...you can tell everyone involved with this ponied up their time and cash without once asking if this was a stupid idea--",1391558400,3,299,5.0
5656061,1,B00BMXT8BQ,This was the second worse movie I've seen in my entire life- barely a plot and terrible acting. Middle schoolers could have made a better movie.,1382313600,4,144,4.576923076923077
5656062,1,B00BMXT8BQ,"OK, so, for me this might have been good - teen girl finds grimoire, invokes demon, hi-jinks ensue. Too bad they foul up every possible thing about the flick.

I watch a lot of indie, micro-budget horror, and this is just awful. What it really amounts to is about 40 minutes of cheesy Heavy Metal videos strung together with four to six pages of dialogue. The grimoire prop looks like a sketch-book with two pentagrams drawn in it, the 'satanic ritual' consists of the chick turning slowly in a tiny pentagram, spouting a half-dozen demon names in a goth dress. They did manage to afford a fairly nice set of vamp fangs, but that's the whole FX budget. No actual efforts are made at acting or directing. The director probably thought he did OK on the music videos - they do stink slightly less than the rest of the film.
Abject crap.",1378080000,9,833,4.480263157894737
5656063,5,B00BMXT8BQ,"Jezebeth had really great rock music. I bought the soundtrack because of it. The main actress, Bree Michaels, was really gorgeous and played the role well. The movie as a whole was well-paced and extremely exciting throughout. Damien Dante is a superb director and writer who keeps the pacing perfect throughout. The storyline is interesting and easy to follow. It really is a movie to watch and will keep you sucked in from the very beginning.

Damien Dante is already a star in the movie world, but he will most definitely be somebody to watch out for in the years to come. Any movie he does is a winner. I will definitely be looking out for Jezebeth 2 and all other works by him!!!",1377561600,,684,4.516129032258065
5656064,1,B00BMXT8BQ,"Only made it about 5 minutes Just plain HORRIBLE!
I think it was made with a 50 dollar budget... don't waste your time",1376611200,,118,4.173913043478261
5656065,1,B00BMXT8BQ,"There are bad movies, and I've watched plenty of them.  This is a rare kind of bad movie that makes me regret liking bad movies.  This is a new kind of awful.  It's like the people who made the movie hate movies.  Don't be like me.  Don't  watch this one.",1376524800,,255,4.0
5656066,5,B00BMXT8BQ,"Outstanding film I rate as ten because of the clearly defined theme and description of human nature under unwitting seduction. Or is it unwitting? The final soundtrack at the end of the credits re emphasizes the theme of the movie as evil being a power based obsession of one or a group, an example being the ones condemning Annabelle Wick. One might want to watch this film more than once because it is cerebral requiring some reflection and introspection.

5656067,2,B00BMXT8BQ,"While I only gave this flick two stars and that means ""I don't like it.""  It doesn't really mean that.  It was like watching a very bad wreck on the highway.  You know the people in the wreck are experiencing pain and suffering but you can't stop watching; you're fascinated.

I really enjoyed the music but the flow of the movie was very choppy and it was hard to figure out where they were going.  The acting for the most part was bad, very bad.",1374624000,,447,4.211764705882353
5656068,1,B00BMXT8BQ,"I have scratched my head until it bled trying to figure out what the heck I just watched?  Was it part rock video?  Was it an audition video?  Was it found footage? Or was it someting else? Well whatever it was it is not meant to be viewed by the public at large. I try to make allowances for low budget movies whenever they show promise, but this flick (if you can call it that) is nothing more than a piecemeal of clips from a cemetery, a home, a stripclub and a church (implied). When you combine that with god awful acting, writing, editing and direction by all parties and silly voiceover dubbing it adds up to this train wreck. The one and only saving grace with this movie is the soundtrack and thats if you are into metal. The disjointed story plays out more like an advertisement for metal bands than a horror story. My computer kept restarting this movie over and over and over like it was punishing me for choosing to watch this nightmare. This movie is truly HORRIBLE TO WATCH  not because of its scary (its not) story, but because of its disjointed and nonsensical writing, acting, direction and editing. The opening credits take about ten minutes to get through and  will give you a pretty good idea of whats in store if you continue watching.  I mean this from the bottom of my heart ""Please Avoid This Retched Movie!!! -10 stars

8571172,1,B00BMXT8BQ,"This is a low budget demonic vampire film. Jezebeth (Bree Michaels) is an old spirit, well at least 1873 who lives on in a modern day Jezebeth. Her roommates are concerned about her fascination with the dark arts, especially when she uses the cheapest Tarot cards available.

The film consists of three things: bad acting, strippers, and metal music. Normally strippers and metal music in any film rates three stars. However the acting in this one was so bad, like Jezebeth, it just sucks the life out of anything.  Most of the cast lists this as their only film credit.

What is unbelievable, it has TWO sequels planned.  Now available on a vampire film four-pack for the price of one DVD.
