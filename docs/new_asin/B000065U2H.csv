1709957,4,B000065U2H,"This is a great dvd for the beginner. After doing it a few times, you pick up the moves easily, so it doesn't bore you to death with explanations of how to do the actual moves. So in this aspect, its' great.
 I would like a more advanced work out like this, so hopefully the next level will be coming out soon. But there is really nothing else out on the market.
There is the workout to music, once you learn the routine, which I use all the time now.
Great product just wish the next level was available.  Scott are you listening?!!",1059609600,7,533,4.165048543689321
1709958,4,B000065U2H,"I love this video.  I discovered it at the library and loved it so much that it was overdue for 11 days.  The moves are very easy to learn.  Had it down for the most part the first time I followed the tape.  I felt invigorated, refreshed, and could not believe the workout I got.  There are a lot of hand movements, but you are primarily working the thighs.  Great for beginners or inconsistent exercisers.  The instructor is also great.",1047600000,4,437,4.3875
1709959,2,B000065U2H,"I bought this DVD with hope that I would lose a few pounds and learn a little Tai Chi. I did neither.
In terms of actually learning Tai Chai, this DVD falls short. I found that Mr. Cole did not give explicit instruction. It seemed that I was expected to either know the Tai Chi forms before hand, or to follow his lead and ""pick it up"".  The pace of the exercises, are fast - meaning that Mr. Cole switches from one form to the other with little advanced warning or preparation. There is a nice feature on the DVD that allows you to jump to a specific form, so I guess if you chose to redo an exercise you would be able to do so relatively easily.
I gave this DVD only two stars one for the quality of the DVD and the other for the artistic touches.",1040515200,10,749,4.026845637583893
1709960,5,B000065U2H,"I was looking for a weight loss exercise or program and this DVD magically appeared to me at the library. After a week of review I bought one. Scott Cole does a great job of instructing the new student to Tai Chi. I only had to lose a few pounds but I wanted a program that was fun and easy and this seems to fill the bill.
Thanks, Scott, for doing such a great job!",1033257600,7,366,3.8933333333333335
1709961,5,B000065U2H,"I highly recommend this DVD for those of you who are bored with the 'normal' routine of workout tapes that leave you exhausted and not really inspired. With Tai Chi you remain relaxed while learning the graceful and beautiful movements. There are no jarring or forceful movements here, everything from the music and the locations flow wonderfully. Scott not only teaches you the basic movements to follow, but also how to accept yourself and the world around you. Also, an added bonus are the nutrition and menu tips to aid in weight loss. Although I am only just beginning my journey to weight loss, I know I will be successful thanks to Scott's inspiration. I look forward to purchasing his other DVD's as well! So if you are in the market to break from the hard working, and breathless world of workout videos, this one is for you. You will feel graceful, energized, and inspired ... and there are not many other videos out there that can promise you that.",1029024000,25,959,4.647058823529412
1709962,5,B000065U2H,"I used the Scott Cole's Beginning Tai Chi prior to buying this.  I  enjoyed it, but after awhile it became a little boring.  However, I recommend trying that video out before you jump into this one.  Scott Cole's Beginning Tai Chi video explained and carried out the moves at a slower pace.  I think Scott Cole's Discover Tai Chi-Weight Loss is a great video.  I have had a lot of fun doing it.  The routine is easy to catch on. It goes at a great pace for both releiving stress and getting a work out.  I believe Scott Cole is a wonderful instructor.  I hope you enjoy it.",1140652800,7,573,4.231481481481482
1709963,5,B000065U2H,"I did this workout today because I had a headache and I didn't feel like doing any of my step aerobics or low-impact aerobics workouts.  But I still wanted to do something to move my body.  This was just right because it wasn't too strenuous.  I really enjoyed it.  I had a little trouble with some of the moves, but nothing too difficult.  I could still move.  I know next time I'll do even better.  It is really wonderful to still be able to do some form of light exercise when you just don't feel all that great.  The production quality is excellent.  I like working out one-on-one with Scott.  The setting was very relaxing, even in the studio.  Scott has a very low-key manner about him.  He is calm and encouraging.  I like that in an instructor.  He is very motivating.  This is an excellent addition to a regular exercise library.",1137456000,7,838,4.421052631578948
1709964,2,B000065U2H,"I am not a Tai Chi person, but the forms should be similar to most of Kung Fu. I had taken some at a gym once and the forms here are not close to the ones I had then. He is in good shape, but not sure that this is how he got that way. It is a fast paced tape, but not one that you will learn the moves from easily. Might have to play it a few times to catch on. Maybe my view is clouded, but not what I expected.",1128988800,6,412,3.4408602150537635
1709965,5,B000065U2H,"Scott Cole does a good job of teaching Tai Chi and touching on the way it can be instrumental in weight loss and everyday life. He covers the concepts of balance, focus, the strength and beauty in slow as well as up-tempo movements, and working within your comfort level - not over extending. I am very new to Tai Chi and find this tape fun, enjoyable, enlightening, and a bit of challenge.

Side note; If you have never done Tai Chi before, I would recommend getting the ""Tai Chi for Beginners"" (different presentor) before doing this one so that you can learn and understand some of the solo formations and movements better. Not that this one is hard to follow, Scott Cole is a good instructor, it's just the way I started out.",1124582400,7,729,4.481203007518797
1709966,4,B000065U2H,I like that the dvd teaches you the steps then repeats them. It's fairly easy to learn. I also like that there is slow and fast pased moves.,1124150400,3,140,4.035714285714286
1709967,4,B000065U2H,"Discover Tai Chi for Weight Loss was my first-ever experience with Tai Chi, and I enjoyed it more than I had anticipated.  Instructor Scott Cole describes it as an ""interval-type workout,"" which means that you alternate between slowly flowing through the movements to performing them at a more upbeat tempo.  The workout begins inside a large, airy studio, and Scott starts with an 8-minute warm-up consisting of gentle arm and leg motions.  One frequently-used transition move is called monkey-bear, which basically means swinging your arms in front of you as you lightly move from side to side.  Following the warm-up, Scott moves into a 21-minute segment of what he says are traditional Tai Chi postures.  Unlike in yoga, these postures are dynamic and consist of simple movements linked in a flow.  Scott introduces each posture first at a slow pace, then speeding it up to tempo, a pace that is brisk but still easy to follow.  The movements range from a basic ""Brush Push""--pushing one arm forward while sliding the other backward--to slightly more strenuous Tai Chi kicks.  During this section, I could definitely feel my heart rate increasing, although this was not a steady effect given the variable pace of the workout.

Once you have learned all of the postures, Scott moves to an outdoor setting, where he combines all of the movements together in a continuous flow.  He repeats the entire series of movements twice:  the first time, he cues the movements via voiceover instruction, but the second time, there is no cueing whatsoever.  Because the postures were so simple and straightforward, I found that I was able to follow along even without the cues, although I did have to keep a close eye on the TV in order to keep up with the transitions from one movement to the next.  Following the flow segment (about 13 minutes), Scott returns to the indoor studio for a 6-minute cool-down and stretch; he also includes some work on body acceptance in this segment.  The total time for this workout was 48 minutes.  Overall, I found this video to be an enjoyable introduction to Tai Chi that provided me with a good, light cardio workout.  I think that this workout would be well-suited to beginning exercisers who are looking for a gentle, low-impact exercise program or more experienced exercisers who enjoy doing a lighter, relaxing workout now and then.",1116374400,42,2365,4.9045226130653266
1709968,4,B000065U2H,"I identify with myself as a runner and normally don't stray too far from that. I have been recovering from injuries caused by my unwillingness to branch out---that is, I haven't been stretching enough and I've been overdoing it. I can't stand doing nothing and have been making an effort to try new things.

This was a nice departure and I liked the ""tempo"" workouts that move through the routine at a faster pace. This is not the traditional slow movements I associate with Tai Chi. I've picked up the moves after two viewings; the transitions are a bit of a challenge for me. At first, I wished, like the other reviewers, that there was more instruction as I have never taken a class or had any other instruction in the moves. In particular, the sequence filmed in Hawaii was difficult to follow as the camera angle changes at inopportune times; admittedly, this is shown after the step by step instructions. For me the purpose was to focus on ""letting go"" and I have decided to do just that and enjoy without putting to much emphasis on doing the moves perfectly. I would imagine that from a weight loss stance the idea is to just keep moving.

Overall, this is a nice DVD: the choreography (for what it is) is good, background music is enjoyable and Scott Cole provides a a calming and encouraging vocal instruction.",1101686400,29,1320,4.588983050847458
1709969,4,B000065U2H,This workout was definitely different than anything I've ever tried before. It is incredibly relaxing yet invigorating. I have a bad back and was able to do all of the moves relatively well. I only gave it four stars for one reason. I think there could have been a little more explanation on some of the movements. I felt that my legs were wanting to do one thing whilst my arms did another. Kinda like when you try to pat your head and rub your belly. I think there could have been a better way to explain the integration of the movements. After a few more tries I'm sure I'll get it down. I would definitely recommend this to others though! :) Happy Tai-Chi'ing!,1092268800,6,664,4.362903225806452
1709970,2,B000065U2H,"I mistakenly assumed with a title of ""DISCOVER Tai Chi"" that Mr. Cole was going to teach me the traditional moves of Tai Chi.  This DVD appears to be an individual's idea of an aerobics program using Tai Chi moves.  I've only been stationed in one place that offered lessons and fell in love with Tai Chi, but only had time to attend for the first few moves.  I've read a couple books describing the art, but thought I'd benefit from being shown the moves.  This is definitely NOT the aide I was looking for.
This guy is probably a great modern dancer and aerobics instructor, but he races through his moves with little instruction or explanation of what one should be experiencing; proper breathing, stance, muscle concentration etc.
Don't recommend it unless you're bored with your current workout and know Tai Chi well.",1074816000,15,822,4.6875
1709971,5,B000065U2H,"I found this DVD at the public library and liked it so much that I ordered it for myself. This is a very good workout and it took me a good month before I could do the entire sequence in one session. And Tai Chi, if done in the right mind set, lends a certain clarity to your entire day. I am still amazed that Tai Chi is such a good workout. You can really feel the heat from following Cole's regimen.
An important note though; please take a Tai Chi class, even just one, with an instructor before jumping into the DVD. There are certain things about posture and stance that no DVD can instruct you in.",1068595200,14,603,4.11864406779661

7961543,5,B000065U2H,"Scott Cole really does it. His products are worth buying. I bought it, even though I don't have to lose weight, to use for exercise and balance. It does the trick. Mr Cole explains the exercises with the how to and the why. I have bought other products of his and never went wrong.

7961544,5,B000065U2H,"Discover Tai Chi with Scott Cole has helped me get out of my sedentary slump.  I'm from the Midwest (Chicago to be specific), and I'm sure that many of us, in general, experience the Winter weight-gain and slightly more sedentary life style during the colder months.  It's already May, and normally I'd be working out hardcore either at the gym doing weights and cardio, or starting another round of P90X to whip myself back into Summer shape.

Unfortunately, I've been feeling worn down and tired from full time work and full time school.  I went to Miami for Spring Break this year, and I honestly looked like crap!  I've just been too exhausted to actually start another intense workout regimen like I would have normally done in the past.  Discover Tai Chi with Scott Cole is exactly what I needed to get my butt back into gear to start exercising again and to regain my focus on living healthily.

This workout DVD is excellent for the Tai Chi beginner.  The movements can be a little confusing at first, but you don't need to be a choreography expert to follow them either. Once you are able to copy the basic movements shown within the exercises, it's smooth sailing from there.  It also helps that Scott Cole is animated yet calm and encouraging throughout the workouts.

I still break into a light sweat while working out to the tempo-ed exercises.  Though intense at times (in a good way), overall this workout DVD is very calming and relaxing.  I've never encountered a workout like Tai Chi before, and I like it.

If you're looking for a moderately challenging workout that's not obnoxiously intense, and that can also help to calm and center your mind, body, and soul, this is the workout for you.",1335916800,,1710,4.66
7961545,5,B000065U2H,I love it. Not once did I have to stand on my head or get on the floor. This is new to me and I love it.,1325635200,,104,2.888888888888889
7961546,5,B000065U2H,"The video is very good quality, for the price, unbeatable! The workout is great, a little fast paced if you're new to Tai Chi, but for someone who has a little experience it is excellent. My 5 year old even does this workout with me, she loves that she gets to ""dance and do karate"" at the same time.",1291680000,,300,4.101694915254237
7961547,4,B000065U2H,"This video features a tai chi introduction that is not exactly traditional. It is front view oriented though. This is usually bad for people who cant translate what they are seeing into body motion. But you can mirror him exactly and he calls out the actual leg or arm u are using if you mirror him. He'll raise his left hand while your raising your right and he'll say ""right hand"". This is enough reason to recommend it. Even if its simplified, even if he's a little smarme. Its easy to mimic from the start. Not a struggle that your going to throw down after one try because theres no one there to straighten you out.",1170806400,,620,4.353448275862069
7961548,5,B000065U2H,"This is a great alternative workout if you're looking to vary your exercise.  The production is great, the music perfect, and Scott Cole a patient and clear teacher.

I started with his Tai Chi for Beginners DVD and I think you would want to do this as well.  Highly recommend that DVD, too.  Great combination of meditation and exercise.

This DVD is a perfect next step after the beginning DVD.

If you are looking for a peaceful, mindful way to exercise, you couldn't find a better DVD than this one.  As a former runner and cancer survivor who needed something more gentle and soothing, this is a great find!",1168128000,4,612,4.559633027522936
7961549,5,B000065U2H,This DVD helps me to wake up and move.  I am glad I purchased his Tai Chi for Beginners and Tai Chi AM/PM workouts first since they accustomed me to the type of movements Tai Chi includes.  I enjoy his discussion of the moves and his thoughts on life in general.  Hopefully it will help me to lose a little weight and tone up.,1156723200,5,326,4.0625
7961550,2,B000065U2H,"I have 3 of Scott Cole's Tai Chi workout tapes. I was very happy with the other two Scott Cole Tai Chi workout DVDs that I use. I have to say that this one is disappointing to say the least. In my opinion, I shouldn't have bought it in the first place. I enjoy the slow meditative movements involved in traditional Tai Chi and this DVD is none of that. I was better off buying a Cardio workout or a Billy Blanks Tae Bo DVD if I wanted to have a nice traditional weight loss workout.",1141862400,6,482,4.03125
