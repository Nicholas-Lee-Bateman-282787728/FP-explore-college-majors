7975516,4,B00007ELFX,"As an ultra-distance runner and intermediate yogi, I've been looking for a practice that would get my blood flowing on off-days without injuring me between runs. I read the reviews for this and thought I'd give it a shot.

Turns out, it's a great - if shorter - practice. Thom and Beryl move through all the basic postures, beginning with a series of sun salutations, all *actually done to breath.* As a big vinyasa fan, I love this, because the flow of the movements don't leave room for extra breathing between postures, until a series of 5 breaths on downward dog at the end of each salutation. Then they move into standing chair and through the standard standing poses (triangle, twisting triangle, right angle, Warriors 1 & 2), and close with asana postures, after each of which another sun salutation vinyasa is performed. It closes with deep breathing & relaxation in corpse pose.

Things I love:
1) Thom performs the modification of a pose while Beryl goes deeper into the full pose.
2) This is a no-frills practice. No kooky music, and almost no speaking from either Thom or Beryl, except to guide you through the postures. The room they're in is a plain room with simple mats. This practice provides nothing to distract you from hearing and seeing what they're doing.

Things I don't love:
1) It's short - literally, a 30 minute practice, with about 15-20 minutes of detailed instructions on various poses at the end.
2) I wish they'd do more balance and upper-body strengthening postures - but that's probably a function of time.

Bottom line: This will be a go-to practice both on running days when I need a better cool down/stretch, and on off days when I don't have time for a full practice but still want to get blood flowing!",1377216000,2,1741,4.6797385620915035
7975517,2,B00007ELFX,"The instruction on this video is too fast.  There is no time to properly get on pose before it goes to the next move.  Also, the voice is not coordinated and lags behind the demonstration.",1267228800,,188,4.3428571428571425
7975518,4,B00007ELFX,"I don't normally do yoga, but this workout has me thinking that I was missing out.  They talk you through the positions and  you do them often enough that you don't have to feel badly if you don't get them on the first try.

 I have recommended this workout to other runners.",1176768000,,275,4.230769230769231
7975519,4,B00007ELFX,"Although the production and sound quality of this DVD are not the best, it does provide a good, short, and no nonsense power yoga workout.  It has one great chapter called Detailed Instructions.  When you go into this chapter it lists most of the poses used in the workout.  You can chose any or all of the poses, and you will get detailed instructions as Thom and Beryl demonstrate the pose.  If you are not familiar with the poses, this would be a great place to start before jumping into the workout.  The workout moves along at a quick pace, and there are a lot of down facing dogs.  The 1st part of the workout has a lot of repetition (they do a series of poses and then do the same series about 2 more times), but the 2nd part of the workout introduces many new poses.  Some of the poses include warrior, down & up dog, expanded leg stretch, sun salutations, spinal twist, triangle, and half bound lotus.  The set is nothing fancy, a plain room with a sky/cloud background.  They have a voice over instructing Thom & Beryl what to do next.  As one reviewer pointed out, it was a little bit wierd at the end when all of a sudden Thom just disappeared,I found myself staring at the TV for a minute wondering if he was going to come back or not! I have read several articles about how yoga is beneficial to runners because it makes them more flexible, and helps to strengthen ligaments around the knees and throughout the body.  Workouts like this definitely make me feel better after a long run!",1049587200,5,1499,4.375451263537906
7975520,3,B00007ELFX,"Yoga for runners is important because inflexibility for runners means injuries. Although the series of moves is useful, I find myself distracted by three flaws in the video. Little warm-up precedes the quick, strenuous moves. The sound quality in few places is poor. Most annoying, at the end, Thom disappears right before Birch leads a relaxation segment. I'm supposed to be relaxing and find myself wondering where he had to go. Everything else is done professionally and well, so these flaws mystify me and, unfortunately, distract me.",1046563200,23,538,5.195402298850575
7975521,5,B00007ELFX,"This is a short, hard-hitting workout.  But, if you are an athlete, this video can greatly enhance your training program.  Like Astanga Yoga from which it is derived, it is intense but will provide an excellent way to cross-train for flexibility, balance and strength.
There are also sections on correct breathing, posture alignment and deep relaxation instructions.
This is a wonderful video and I highly recommend it.",1044835200,8,419,5.2388059701492535
7975522,5,B00007ELFX,"This DVD is well chaptered and filmed nicely.  Beryl and her husband Thom Birch perform a 30 minute routine inside a sparse room with a wooden floor.  Not much to look at, but I find that really doesn't matter with yoga anyway, as there isn't much chance to look at the screen.
This is a modifed Ashtanga sequence that is about 30 minutes long.  Very nice for short practice days.  The DVD is very well chaptered and has more instruction as a separate chaptere after the workout.  I highly recommend this for anyone interested in a shorter routine.  They did a great job putting together a good sequence of postures that flows, and also discuss someof the more cerebral aspects of yoga (which can be avoided if that is your choice).",1042329600,17,732,4.549618320610687
