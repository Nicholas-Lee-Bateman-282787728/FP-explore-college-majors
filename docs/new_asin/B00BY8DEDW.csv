5682020,5,B00BY8DEDW,"Typical roosterteeth stuff, really obscure humor and its totally worth your money. Comes with a decent amount of original content. I would say this though alot of shorts from the best of rt shorts dvd has already been uploaded to youtube so thats sort of dissapointing. Other than that great buy.",1391990400,,296,4.823529411764706

5682025,5,B00BY8DEDW,"It is a great film that combines the two great best of shorts, so if you don't want to buy both separately, it comes in one case.",1377216000,,129,3.814814814814815
5682026,5,B00BY8DEDW,"There used to be another review that said this was a scam, and that this DVD is available on the Rooster Teeth site for much cheaper. In actuality, this particular item is NOT available in the Rooster Teeth store - this is a single-case two-disc set, featuring the FULL ""Best Of"" DVDs for Shorts and Animated Adventures. The only bundle in the Rooster Teeth store is the ""Best Of"" bundle that features three cases and three DVDs - best of Shorts, Animated Adventures, and Red vs Blue. My guess is that Rooster Teeth made this product for those of us that already purchased the ""Best of RvB"" DVD when it came out, and only need the best of Shorts and AA to complete our collection.

So in short, this is one case, but two DVDs - the best of Shorts, and the best of Animated Adventures. You don't get both cases like on the Rooster Teeth site, but you get both FULL DVDs (for a little cheaper - both DVDs on the RT site are 9.95 each plus shipping).

If you like Rooster Teeth's content, why haven't you bought this yet???",1373587200,6,1020,4.335078534031414

8575430,5,B00BY8DEDW,Rooster Teeth are really funny and these shorts are some of their best live action skits. The narrative mode is also really funny.,1441584000,,130,4.695652173913044

8575437,5,B00BY8DEDW,"This DVD is a little different. The guys come up with a story to tie every single short together, which leads to some pretty insane claims. I love RT, and though I've seen all of the shorts online, this (to me) is totally worth owning.",1392076800,,235,4.2444444444444445
