8652850,5,B00JPKBG1I,"Other reviewers missing the point.  This documentary, along with the subject, is pure genius.  Just like Hannett wasn't the same old predictable BBC engineer/producer, neither is this documentary the same old slick-craft.  What it is: pure unadulterated L7FE.",1491782400,,259,5.7631578947368425

8652853,2,B00JPKBG1I,"A book with these contents would be much more bearable.  In fact, my impression is that all this is is pieces of book research, poorly videotaped on, yes, video tape (not memory cards), not lit for the camera, and only incidentally mic'd, as archival material to be used during said book authorship, and only as an afterthought cobbled together as a very long series of discussions and reminiscences about the life and times of the subject.  In fact, the liner notes give credence to this impression.  Having read the reviews on Amazon's UK site, I was really expecting a bit more.  No, of course you're not going to get a big budget slick documentary like you would for a top commercial act like U2 or whomever, but there are many ways in which this video could have been greatly improved without breaking the bank, keeping in mind that the ""interviews"" are of fairly recent vintage, not contemporaneous with Hannett's life.

Firstly, proper broadcast or film style interviews might have resulted in more engaging dialog.  Mostly here the guests are allowed to ramble indefinitely, and the editing does little to tighten the pace.  Oddly, in the middle of a stretch of long dialog, sometimes brief snippets of another guest abruptly appear before a return to the previous shot.

A simple video lamp, along with staging shots away from bright sunlight at adverse angles, would have improved the scenes considerably.

Putting a decent microphone consistently within range of the subject's voice would have been quite helpful.

Choosing a cheap modern camera instead of a hodgepodge of tape based formats (including VHS) would have kept the picture much clearer.  It felt at times like I was watching a VHS multi-generation dub, which may not be too far from the truth.

Having said all that, one can overlook certain shortcomings if the content is compelling enough.  Having collected about 15 books as well as several videos on Joy Division / New Order / Factory topics and countless recordings of these and related artists, it's save to say that the Hannett story is one in which I'm fairly well interested, even though not necessarily a hardcore fan of his every production to the same degree.  Also, it's not that I object in any way to the inclusion of many obscure characters from his early years; but when they are left to wander aimlessly through their memories, while appearing blurry on the screen and at times hard to understand, it's just not that entertaining of a film, which is, especially for the premium prices being charged, a shame.",1416960000,,2550,4.872685185185185
