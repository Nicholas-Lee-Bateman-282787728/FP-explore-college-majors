8634807,3,B00HRGRQHU,"LAX vs. New Church - Street Fight - I was amped to see a reunion of LAX, I remember their great hardcore matches from back in the day . . . however this is not one of them. It stays mostly as a basic tag match with barely using any weapons. Rather lacking.

ODB vs. Jackie - Hardcore Match - Unlike the previous match, this one was at least trying to live up to it's stipulation. It's not bad, and has comedy here and there, but it's the same kind of match you'd see on Impact. Not bad though.

Bad Influence vs. Generation Me - Ladder Match - Clearly the match of the night. This was more of what I expected for this DVD. The match was very fast-paced, lots of crazy stunts, and a barrage of bad landings that just blew my mind.

Storm/Magnus/Holly vs. Aces & 8s - Six Man Hardcore Elimination Match - Unfortunately there was hardly any weapon use and almost all of the eliminations happened in 45 seconds. You'd think a hardcore match with Bob Holly would be awesome, but this lacked.

Hardcore Battle Royal - The funniest match on this card, I loved it!

Joseph Park vs. Judas Mesias - Monster's Ball - It's more like a standard hardcore match since there's no barbed wire or thumbtacks (regular in Monster's ball matches) but for a basic hardcore match its satisfying. I didn't expect much with this Joseph Park character, and while this won't top their matches from 2007-2008, it's satisfying for this dvd.

Team 3D vs. Jeff Hardy/Runt - Tables Match - This match felt very underwelming, especially being the main event. It was only about 8 minutes and seems more like a match you'd see on impact instead of main eventing a PPV.

Overall its not bad, but not great either. It does live up enough to being a hardcore-themed ppv and gives you that TNA hardcore fix, but much like the other ONO dvds, get them for a lil cheap.",1405382400,,1828,4.390532544378698
8634808,3,B00HRGRQHU,"The LAX-New Church tag team match was acceptable with solid wrestling to boot. The ODB-Jackie Moore-NO-DQ match felt more like a comedy bout then a actual fight. The Bad Influence-Generation Me-$20,000 Tag Team Ladder match was a highspots fun-fest. The 9 Man Hardcore Gauntlet match was stupid but the fun kind of stupid so enjoy it for what it's wroth. The Hardcore 6 man tag team elimination match between the team of James Storm,Magnus & Hardcore Holly against the Aces & Eights(DOC,Knux & Wes Brisco) was sloppy and better off as a house show bout then a PPV match. The Monsters Ball match between Joseph Park & Judas Mesias also felt like a bad comedy bout too. The Jeff Hardy/Brother Runt-Team 3D-Tables Match was not great but pretty good. I give this PPV a 6 out of 10.",1390176000,,778,4.644927536231884
8634809,3,B00HRGRQHU,"This PPV is part of the ""TNA: One Night Only"" series which are just stand alone PPV events (shows that occur outside the current storylines & happenings on IMPACT Wrestling) with each one having a special theme.  This edition is based on superstars of the past & present having a night of hardcore action with each match having a special stipulation with Mike Tenay & Jeremy Borash doing commentary on this show.

Street Fight Match: L.A.X. vs. New Church - Both teams started out with some moves focusing on the head such as headbutts & tornado DDT & a big boot that stopped one man dead in his tracks before the match turned into a four way brawl on the floor with various weapons used from a chair to a road sign along with the ringside enviroment as well.  This was a decent brawl but came off more like a relaxed No DQ match than a street fight.

No Disqualification Match: O.D.B. vs. Jackie Moore - Former allies with the common bond of being two of the toughest knockouts in history went at it here with the fight going in & out of the ring while using various feminine products in various ways such as vasoline, sprayed with shaving cream, hit with a broom, and choked with a vale.  For what it was, the brawl was entertaining.

$20,000 Ladder Match: Generation Me vs. Bad Influence - Both teams started out double teaming each other in the opening moments with the ladders coming into play not soon after leading to some highlights such as a ladder being one man while he was climbing another, the classic Terry Funk airplane spin, ladder superkicked while around one man's neck, a cutter off the top of the ladder, back body drops & monkey flips onto the ladder, one man suplexed onto the outside hitting a ladder on the way down, and the sight of how one man was knocked off a ladder only to springboard off the ropes into a somersault plancha.  This was definitely the match of the night as everyone took & gave some hard hits here.

Hardcore Gauntlet Match: Gunner vs. Crimson vs. Guido vs. Funaki vs. Sam Shaw vs. Johnny Swinger vs. 2 Cold Scorpio vs. Shark Boy vs. Devon Storm - This match was held under Royal Rumble rules where it was a battle royal with a new participant coming in at timed intervals with the twist being that each participant would come in with a weapon to use during the match leading to seeing various unusual items such as a dust pan & umbrella & plastic guardrail along with some of them used like a golf club crossface & whatever was in Shark Boy's bag.  This match had some giggle moments with the items used but wasn't anything special past your normal battle royal.

Hardcore Elimination Match: James Storm & Magnus & Bob Holly vs. Aces & Eights (D.O.C., Knux, Wes Brisco) - Storm & Magnus recruited the former ""Hardcore"" Holly into this match based off his past experiences in this environment but was pretty much just another average tag match that told the story of one man being isolated from the other teaming building to the hot tag with a small amount of weapons eventually starting to appear towards the end of the match along with a series of back to back eliminations making this match really nothing special past the surprise appearance of Holly in the beginning.

Monster's Ball Match: Joseph Park vs. Judias Mesias - Before I get started, it should be noted that the story behind this match was Mesias & James Mitchell came to the event looking for Abyss but challenged his brother when they couldn't find him yet the history package they showed about Mesias' past in TNA still contained the storyline that Mesias & Abyss were brothers with Mitchell being the father.  Parks tried to pay ""cat & mouse"" only for Mesias to use the weapons to beat down Park causing Park to resort to desperate tactics & some of the weapons himself with both men going back & forth using some of the items like a chair & kendo stick resulting in the typical ""Joseph Park"" match where he still came off acting very inexperienced & questioning himself at times which definitely hurt the match was it didn't live up to the ""hardcore"" standard this match is known for more.

Tables Match: Jeff Hardy & Brother Runt vs. Team 3D - Hardy was the surprise partner for Runt who was out for revenge for being setup during Bully Ray's wedding months earlier as we were treated to a classic Team 3D promo before the match as they singled out the smaller Runt right away & even bully the referee who wasn't having any part of it while taking cheap shots whenever they could to keep control of the match while Hardy & Runt worked together including taking a pages out of Team 3D's own playbook with the match resorting to brawling both in & out of the ring from both teams.  This was a good tables match.

Despite this event being setup a night of hardcore action, only two of the matches have replay value while none of the rest of the matches were bad & unwatchable but easily forgettable once it was over so I would try to seek out the two matches elsewhere or get this event on a rental/stream.",1389225600,,5021,4.490131578947368
