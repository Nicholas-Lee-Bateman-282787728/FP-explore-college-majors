I love everything about this movie itself, the music, the art, but the picture quality of this blu ray is hideous. Someone needs to get serious about restoring this film and stop pedaling trash. People go to blu ray to get the most out their TV's and to get the best possible quality of the film they can get. This release is a total rip off.",1307318400,35,423,4.108433734939759

4404941,4,B004LV3VQE,"First, it needs to be noted this is NOT a kid safe movie.  Sex, full frontal male and female nudity, drug use (not just marijuana), gore, strong language, terrorism, mild racism are all present here.  If you want a sample, grab the magazine.  Basically, if you don't mind them reading a Playboy while watching softcore porn and hearing remarks about Jewish stereotypes, then this is just what they need.  If not, stay away.

Movie-wise, the film is still one of the most influential pieces to be viewed in cinematics.  The art and material give you an idea of the culture during the time it was made.  It was made on a shoe-string budget, compared to other movies of that time, and they still introduced new animated technology that animators like Ralph Bakshi would use in future movies (Fire and Ice) and game companies currently use to make games.  The story isn't the best, but it is entertaining.

Quality is about as good as the VHS version.  I was hoping for an updated or color corrected version where the colors are faded, but this is another Laser Disc version copied to Blu-Ray.  Worth having for it's cinematic value, cultural significance and the excellent artwork.",1514678400,,1178,4.753694581280788

4404959,3,B004LV3VQE,"Really, this is another two and a half star film.  The positives are the scope of imaginations placed in the motion picture format.  The negatives are the aggrandizement of the hard rock counter culture that was at its height in the 70s and 80s.

I've always been of the opinion that the science fiction fan base is a lot larger than the producers of this film and other scifi offerings give the American public credit.  And by ""fan"" I don't mean someone who exclusively watches the genre, but someone who likes a good film and doesn't mind a fantastic journey outside everyday experience.  If you look at the huge amount of scifi films cranked out in the 50s and 60s you'll note that none of them placated to ""nerd culture"", but were meant for everyone.

Which is why I hate this film in spite of also liking elements of it.  This film, by the producers' own admission on the documentary on the DVD and bluray, was created by way of marketing psychology.  The film doesn't stick with the original stories, but tweaks them to make them appealing to the young counter-culture generation that was alive at the time.  And it angers me and makes me hate this film because it didn't need to be, but they did so for safety (to guarantee money back on the film) by placating to what they thought would be the core audience.

I like animation, and the scope of imagination in this film is impressive.  But it didn't need the sex, it didn't need the drugs, and the black humor (unless it was in the original material) also didn't need to be.  But, to spice up the material, that's what these guys did.

Who knows.  Maybe they were right.  I personally have my doubts, but I do see their logic.  Either way, the tawdryness of the film, having grown up with hard rock white kids who perpetually did drugs, drew  explicit sexual graffitti on bus seats and school desks and chairs, the kind of kids who broke all kinds of laws, were obnoxious on all kinds of levels, and, on top of that, had a sense of racial privilege as well.  That audience was big, but they weren't as large as the mainstream movie going audience, who, if this film had been appropriately executed, could have appealed to the everyday 70s movie goer.  If a nation like Japan, far more conservative and racist than the US can over hope to be, create animated material with sex and violence for adult viewership, then one wonders why Hollywood producers hadn't learned the lesson.

And that's what I think of this film.  It could have been better and been a bit more memorable as a mainstream classic with a different kind of cult status, but instead has the counter-culture legacy that it does.

A missed opportunity.  Watch at your own risk.",1491177600,,2699,4.5309917355371905
4404960,5,B004LV3VQE,I LOVE this flick! First saw it at all night summer movie bash in the 70's. Thank goodness this version takes the left-to-right slow roll out! (Was that really happening? Or was it the result of too much beer and other things?),1490572800,,227,4.428571428571429

4404974,5,B004LV3VQE,"Heavy Metal (1981) is definitely the classic cult film in that its approach (goofy plots, strange characters) coupled with very good animation,  give it a distinction as being an original in its genre. The film is about a mysterious green orb that can have deadly consequences to those who mess with it. It appears in 8 different 'episodes' that comprise this film. I describe this film as being D&D with technology; the time that this film debuted (1981) was a time when D&D was wildly popular. The episodes remind me of a world of fantasy with accompanying violence and strange happenings. Heavy Metal is a fun film, despite its strangeness; I was thoroughly entertained and very impressed by its ability to depict incredible imagination that borders on twisted, yet keeping a level of respectability. We are taken aback by the nudity and violence, all the while appreciating its human elements. This is the perfect midnight film, and it has very good song choices that are just enough in the background to not dominate the story. The special features are extensive, and really depict a genuine effort into bringing one of the most unusual animated films to life. Heavy Metal has been assimilated into our culture slowly, but still resonates to this day, and for that I'm very happy; this film is an incredible experience, all things considered. Essential.",1469750400,4,1358,4.956140350877193

Showed this to my gf's teenage son and he was blown away and had new respect for me on my 'film knowledge'. I made sure to warn him the music and animate were 'old school' but he really digged it. He felt this way as well when he watched my Fight Club dvd as well. LOL!",1467849600,,499,4.365591397849462
4404976,5,B004LV3VQE,"This is a combination of a many small stories with a little tidbit to tie them all together, clever and good in my opinion. If you have read Heavy Metal magazine in the past it feels a lot like that, just moving and with awesome music (and the music is great if you are into 80's metal (is there anything else?))
Some of the shorts are better than others, or that is how I thought when I was younger when I watched it the first time or 10. Now a days I like them all, though the funnier ones are still the best, none are bad. The aliens that steal a congressman is one of the funniest ""Do we have any of that Niborg left?"" still cracks me up. And to hear someone say ""Give me a break!"" still sounds like the trial of Stern, and the zombies that follow are not as creepy as they were 30 years back.
I wish they would make more like this.

The picture was remastered/converted beautifully! Images were crisp and full of depth. The soundtrack came through beautifully in 5.1.
Now, this is not a single story with modern Pixar quality animation. When this was made the home computer barely existed and animation was done mostly by hand, one cell at a time.
Think of this as several short stories, all by different storytellers and artists, but all following a common theme. One of the things that made this so groundbreaking when it came out was the adult themes in an animated picture. There are bare breasts, off-screen sex, drug use and major violence. This ain't no Loony Tunes! And then tie all of this together with a soundtrack form some of the biggest rock bands of the day.
It may be a bit of a trip down memory lane for those of us that came of age in the 70s but younger generations that appreciate high quality animation and ""big hair"" music will enjoy this BluRay.",1455408000,5,1184,4.511627906976744

If you like the movie and the sound track then you owe it to yourself to buy a copy of the sound track on either vinyl or CD. It's frakkin' awesome.

I love this movie. And if someone in Hollywood ever takes a few minutes to pull their head out and they remaster the film I'll be more than happy to purchase another copy.",1423872000,4,638,4.096

4405037,5,B004LV3VQE,"So if you do not like sci-fi, Heavy Metal magazine, or some good early 80's hard rock, this movie is not for you.

However I enjoy all three of those so I REALLY enjoy this movie. To be honest... I saw it in the theaters at least 5 times when it came out.

The story/stories are fun and exciting. The fact that each story is written and animated by a different person so that you get a really cool feel to what was going on in this genre at the time is what this movie was about. The cast is classic and identifiable instantly. The soundtrack even today ROCKS!

This movie was in pre production in the late 70's so anyone knocking the animation should really try and put that in perspective. In 1982 this was some ground breaking processes.

If you thought this was a Oscar nominee and was the best choice for a first date movie? Shame on you for not watching a trailer! This is not ""Driving Miss Daisy"" or ""Raging Bull"" and never tried to pretend it was.

If you are looking for some nostalgia, some classic animation (by today's standards), some award winning writers (in this genre), and a hard rocking soundtrack... This is for you!

So you need to buy this on Blu-Ray? If it cost the same as the standard wide screen disc go for it. I am not sure I see much difference though and I have had this in every format since I paid over $100 for it on VHS when it first released.",1407628800,2,1377,4.216730038022813

4405045,5,B004LV3VQE,"I have read all the reviews concerning Heavy Metal on Blu-Ray. While everyone is perfectly entitled to their own opinion, I offer this most HONEST review. I will not confirm nor deny the review's ranging from 1 Star to 5 Star. I merely submit my own life's journey surrounding Heavy Metal.
Firstly and most importantly, we must keep in mind that this piece of work was created over 33 years ago. Long before CGI was available. Back when cell-to-cell hand art work was State of the Art. This movie was, at the time, the best American audience's could ""party"" too. Aside from Anime, HM was America's answer to the last of the post-hippie counter culture. Being that 1981 was a year stuck in the midst of cold-war thinking, Generation X was still seeking a foothold anywhere we could, HM exemplified in Cartoon form, what we as wandering spirits were doing... Sex, drugs & Rock and Roll. Or Heavy Metal music to be exact!

Now, the HONEST, personal-self disclosure. Of all reviews I have read, not one person spoke of what MOST of us ORIGINAL movie viewers were doing in 1981. There were good reasons for HM being a ""Midnight Showing!"" Sure, the overt sexual content and sexual innuendos seemed to happen from start to end. Rather it was more likely the dregs who patroned the theaters. As I was only 17 at the time, most of my fellow viewers were nearly the same age, doing the same thing! We partied our asses off before walking into the theater, sat in those pot-smoke filled screenings, (of course I helped the cause), and left more rowdy than hell!

Try running HM durring the daytime? Did those theater owners think they might attract a better, family friendly crowd? No way! HM was made for us! The Stoners... Some scenes as the Loc-Nar tells, is filled with ""Cocaine"" laid out like a road map on the spaceship! Uh, was one to think it might be table salt from another Galaxy that these Aliens required? Hey, if SEX is something every species does, with gleeful indulgence, why not drugs?

Although not a single reviewer wrote of this BLATANT fact, as much as the ""oh so sexual content at the drop of a G-string"", maybe the FEW people who actually read these reviews (like myself), might derive a clearer picture of WHAT THIS CLASSIC WORK OF CINEMATIC ART INCLUDES!

Look, this was another lifetime ago. 33 years has passed. I do not do those things anymore nor do I""run"" with that crowd. I am a responsible parent now with 2 great kids. They are the loves of my life. Those ""partying days"" are  long gone too! Many years ago. I have been teaching my kids of the dangers that drug use and abuse will do!

As for HM, it really doesn't compare much to what the content kids can find on the internet today. Would I allow them to watch HM with me? NO! This is not a kid friendly movie. I have had the VHS version in my collection since it's original release. Yet as my home theater system has been revamped into Blu-Ray and DVD based, I have not actually seen this classic for years. Way too long! This Blu-Ray was a gift from my wife over the holidays. No sooner than I pushed the play button, that haunting tune sent chills down my spine. I was taken back to those days and nights of ritual ""party to the theater"" and sat still until closing credits.

To the nay-sayers about the inability to clean up for a Blu-Ray. I tend to agree that more work should have been put into upgrading picture quality. If this was the best that could be done, then selling it on Blu-Ray is no more than rehashing the same product with the GLAM of Blu-Ray for the almighty dollar. As for the musical choices, well, I LOVE HEAVY METAL MUSIC! If this makes me bias then so be it. The only true METAL MUSIC on the soundtrack of HM is Black Sabbath's ""Mob Rules."" I guess Blue Oyster Cult and Sammy Hagar could qualify. But Devo?

In any case, HM is a cult classic. It is Nostalgia for those who chose not to admit all I just put out there. Or it could be reflections of what you were doing, how you were living and with whom you lived it. This is the basis for Nostalgia. A smell. Sound. Phrase or voice. Heavy Metal on Blu-Ray has captured the essence of what once WAS! I couldn't recommend this disc any higher. It is simply a masterpiece that is timeless!

Put aside the ""boobage"" as one reviewer said. Keep the rampant sexual situations in a purely funny context. Allow HM to be the ""grainy, 1981, cheesy storylines"" movie for what it is. This is a fabulous movie. Does a couple of the story artistry work lag? Yes. But watch the others that are STILL, to this day, incredibly well drawn! For instance, ""B-17"" is a haunting chapter drawn with talent of the highest order! What a shame that this tale didn't get a longer budget to be told. I think this was the best story, purely out of the realism in the artists effort! Chilling!

Overall, this is a story of Good vs. Evil. The Loc-Nar seeks out ""Girl"" as if it wants to fight another day. The only difference between HM's variation of Good vs. Evil compared to today's reality, is that it is greatly dumbed down... for the Stoner. Let it rest.

This is my personal, HONEST review of Heavy Metal on Blu-Ray. To the 3,4, and 5 Star reviewers and the 2 and 1 Stars... We NEED to lighten up people! It's only a movie. Just enjoy it......",1388966400,7,5269,4.416065911431514
