3897439,4,B002BWP2IK,"If this is the two hour pilot from SciFi then this is my review.  It looks like it will be a good program, it's like a cross between 'X-Files' and 'Fringe' and 'The Mentalist'.  All three programs have a smart woman who works for a government agency partnered with a quirky male.  In fact the woman on 13, Fringe and Mentalist all seem to buy their pants and shirts from the same store (Tight body fitting)!

From what I can tell, the Warehouse is the place where they took the ""Ark"" at the end of the first Indiana Jones.  There it sits with a lot of other metaphysical and super-natural stuff and inventions that were way before their time or our time or whatever.  The three leads are all very comfortable with their characters and the secondary characters (Mrs. Fredericks played by CCH Pounder especially) add just the right little extra to make the show enjoyable.  Each week the agents will be sent out to find/rescue/destroy/kidnap/etc. some one or something related to one or more of these strange objects.  How they go about it will be the premise of each episode.

Here's hoping that they don't try to make the two agents a couple but keep them as slightly off-center friends.  The woman who runs the bed-and-breakfast would be a good match for the crazy guy agent.  It will depend on how they choose to fill out the story and backgrounds of the agents that will determine whether this becomes a success or a flop.

3897509,4,B002BWP2IK,"The show's premise is interesting and original, the story writing is mostly very good and the ensemble cast do engage us and make us care about them. There is enough variety from episode to episode to keep viewers watching, and the warehouse itself is a character in its own right, not merely an exotic setting. As we learn the warehouse's backstory, and the backstories of the characters the series gains depth and credibility. However, there were a few elements that I found weakened the show. The characters try too hard at times to be zany and wacky and their repartee could easily date the show quickly. At times the show stretches narrative credibility, even defined by its own narrative parameters. Some of the artifacts are a bit silly and there was for me too many deus ex machina style entries into the stories. Overall, well worth watching and strong enough to satisfy sf and fantasy viewers.",1516752000,,903,4.794871794871795

3897735,3,B002BWP2IK,"Season 1 took a turn for the worse when they introduced the character Claudia Donovan, who is a mouthy, know-it-all, shallow woman with lots of cliche, attitude, and whining.

3897840,5,B002BWP2IK,"These disks work great in my Panasonic and Sony Blu-ray players. I was concerned they would not play since they were a UK import but they work like any other blu-ray disk I own.

These have a picture quality and sound that is as good and better than the Warehouse 13 dvd disks I borrowed from my library that were released in the United States.  Currently there is a big price difference between this UK import and the Warehouse 13 Complete Series released in the United States. I am very happy with this UK import.

The disks come with extras including interviews with the cast and crew, bloopers and deleted scenes.  I have not compared the UK import and the one released in the US so there may be difference but I am happy with the extras. While this has the two Warehouse 13 episodes where Fargo comes to Warehouse 13 and where Fargo gets stuck in a computer game and needs to be saved by the Warehouse 13 gang,  it does not have the crossover episode, which was a Eureka episode, where Claudia goes to Eureka. I cant remember if the American released dvd version has the episode.

When the disks first start, the language option as well as the  icons which have the episodes, extras and option to use closed captions, are different from the American dvd released version but they are easy to use. I have watched the extras and used closed the captioning without a problem.  As mentioned the episodes both in terms of picture and sound are as good as and better than the  American released dvd version I have seen.

Warehouse 13 was a fantastic series that along with Eureka got cancelled way too early. There is nothing as good on television now so I am enjoying this great series.",1484179200,7,1686,4.480392156862745

with all the extras the previous dvd's and blu-rays have the only major difference is
It has the Ratings at the bottom on left side of box

3897843,5,B002BWP2IK,Best ever,1483920000,,9,4.0
3897844,4,B002BWP2IK,"I like this show for a few reasons.

In one case, it is very similar in tone to The Librarians in that you have magical thingies that are floating around in the world that need to be controlled.  So *somebody* has to run around collecting and cataloging them.  Enter: Warehouse 13.  I'll always watch at least 5-10 episodes based on that premise alone even if they are put together on some 5th grader's iPhone on Youtube.

Warehouse 13 is just a *little* more adult in language and setup.  So, for me, I could watch The Librarians with kids or the very elderly and not be embarrassed, but I think I'd take a pass on watching this most of the time with the under-ten set.  So if they are old enough to have had ""the talk"" (11 or so in my book) then they will be able to handle the very minimal adult themes.  But everybody has a different road here and it isn't as risqu as a soap opera or anything.

The big and I mean REALLY BIG difference for me is that this is a much more American show and has a much more American focus than The Librarians.  It aims for inclusion without tokenism and generally, I think, hits it.  Almost.  I mean to say instead of the same old wands and swords and holy grails being left lying around in public parks and people's attics to be chased down by white folks who are oh-so worried, you have this amalgam that is very American -  e.g. Harriet Tubman's thimble that absorbed magical shape-shifting properties as she led her charges along the trail to protect them being sought after by the Warehouse's Director Mrs. Fredericks, facilitated by Artie, and  sought after by the weakest members of the ensemble in the field.

So that's my take.  I like this show.  I wish it had had more traction, as this is the kind of show that really helps facilitate and develop  sense of Americanness to modern life and adventure stories.  I appreciate seeing people like me and you (and YOU!  and you too!)  doing fantastic and dynamic things together.

It feels almost right for what American shows should look like in the inclusion zone.  It gives almost everyone a sense of belonging and place without resorting to Artie yelling ""Oy Vey"" every ten minutes and Fredericks snapping her neck.  It is such a low bar to hit, but so many shows either ignore it or miss it entirely. This show at least *trys* and most of the time almost hits it.",1483920000,3,2359,4.419953596287703
3897845,5,B002BWP2IK,Its great to binge a show you haven't seen in a while. Sale price was 50% of what I was expecting!,1483488000,,98,3.7142857142857144
3897846,1,B002BWP2IK,"I was a little concerned that this might not play in my player, but it did fine. Frankly, I am amazed at the amount of material for the price.  It's a good digital transfer, although does not play in surround sound although it says it is DTS encoded.  The menu is fairly clunky and the chapters could have been much better placed.  All in all, a good value with some disc authoring shortcomings.

IMPORTANT UPDATE!  A week after I purchased this product, I discovered that there are major authoring problems with the discs.  The episodes are terribly out of order.  I went online and see that this has been a long standing problem that was known back in 2011.  I have contacted the seller and as yet, have not received a reply.  I also contacted Universal Pictures UK via e-mail and received a reply that basically said ""We get a lot of e-mails and may choose not get back to you.""  Really??? Are you kidding me?  In addition, there is nothing on the discs that identifies the episodes enough to even discern what order they should be in so if one wanted to keep the discs and just shuffle them around, how would one know what the next episode should be?

3898089,5,B002BWP2IK,"I have been waiting for about two years for this to be released on blu-ray and the fact that a UK version that was region free came out which was actually cheaper than US based versions of the DVDs, was great.

I initially had some issues playing these discs on my blu-ray player, but it was the fault of my player, not the discs themselves. I had to set the ""auto"" feature for resolution off and select 1080 instead of letting the player choose (between 480, 720, 1080), which would result in the screen blanking out every few minutes. I've had this issue with my Sony blu-ray player on a few US based blu-ray discs that are new, but not with others...

The high resolution quality is otherwise spot on for these discs. I mostly look at skin texture to see if its really coming through well and saw no problem here. One thing for US purchasers to be aware of with these is that the UK/European menu system for discs is different from ours. They use a list of symbols for options such as ""play all"" or ""choose episode"" or ""special features"" with no text or caption explaining the meaning of the symbols. (I image everyone across the pond automatically knows what these symbols mean). So the little arrow that we interpret as a ""play"" button in the menu is their ""play all"" and the little TV screen icon is their version of choosing from a list of episodes. The asterisk symbol is their icon for special features... You get used to it after viewing a few discs but its not intuitive right off the bat.

Warehouse 13 was unique and fun to watch. Its sad to see it died after four and a half seasons, but it was fun while it lasted.",1464739200,39,1629,4.3519736842105265

Strongly written and very different characters that bump into each others corners and raw spots, interesting artifacts well linked to historical figures and places.  Some weak writing from time to time, like having them sometimes jump to conclusions on insufficient evidence in later episodes which the observant and intelligent agents shown in the pilot episode would not do.

3898804,4,B002BWP2IK,"I have been watching a lot of these Amazon tv series as I recover from surgery. I like Warehouse 13. The 3 main characters are Artie, who's like this chubby teddy bear mid-age guy with some rough edges, but brilliant and the expert in all things WH13. They draft these two secret service agents, Myka and Pete, and work out of WH13 in the middle of nowhere, South Dakota. Their leader is the mysterious Mrs. Frederic. There are also characters added, like Claudia, and Leena.

Myka and Pete go out looking for artifacts from the deep past that have special powers, as tracked down by Artie. There's a villain in the midst too, and all sorts of relationship issues going on with all the characters.

It's a comedy/sometimes drama, as they usually end up in trouble, but like Batman and Robin from the TV series, no matter how dark the situation looks, they always seem to prevail. I highly recommend this series. I've already started season 2...I think there are 4 or 5 seasons total. enjoy!",1441670400,,990,4.619318181818182

Pros: They have some cool gadgets and old advertising signs.
Cons: Acting by the female lead is pretty bad. The female agent in the 2nd? episode would have been a better lead in my opinion. The male lead is Ok. Watching these two would give you a very low opinion of secret service though. Their juvenile antics may amuse your 12 year old.

I think the directing is bad and the writing is not much better. I started watching ""Firefly"" which has less sci fi elements but is better entertainment overall.",1440806400,,567,4.4

I fell in love with Mika the same way Pete did and I laughed and cried along with all the characters as they spent their days in endless wonder. When I first started watching it, I figured it was a rehash of the original Friday the 13th series in that every week the team tracks down dangerous objects which give their user deadly abilities. I believe the producers gave a nod to the old series by using the same number. However, the characters of Warehouse 13 have much more depth, are so much better flushed out and there is a level of mirth throughout the series which makes it much more real. I could have enjoyed this series for an additional five seasons.",1438819200,,718,4.286764705882353

3898996,5,B002BWP2IK,"I watched Warehouse 13 on SyFy fairly avidly. The stories were extremely out of order, and the narrative for the main story ( about the Warehouse as a whole) lost a bit. Each episode is mostly self-contained, but key elements make understanding the show as a whole easier if you watch the episodes in sequence, or at least know where each episode fits in to the greater whole. I can watch the episodes repeatedly since I like the characters, and the story lines are excellent. So, the benefit of seeing the stories in sequence helps quite a bit both in understanding and enjoyment.
Also, I like Myka almost as much as I like ""HG"" :-), a later series addition",1438214400,,658,4.53781512605042

3899074,3,B002BWP2IK,"Program has some charming aspects, and is very much a replay of some older themes. The first 3 shows were fun but became formulaic and story line is beginning to drag on each new episode. For science fiction, it is fun and has a nice interplay of old stories and other fictional ideas (including Alice through the looking glass) but the stories are becoming less and less fun with additional episodes. It's a bit disappointing that the young woman who becomes a new team member also becomes tiresome in her naivet and repeating her mistakes that unlock all sorts of previously contained mysterious objects over and over again, which lead to having to recontain the same objects. Sometimes mysteries are best enjoyed when not everything is explained in great detail.",1437436800,,765,4.892307692307693

3899166,3,B002BWP2IK,"Interesting and original premise--a warehouse where the U.S. government Secret Service keeps the ""artifacts"" (a loaded word in this series) that have been responsible for X-Files-like events. The artifacts come from legend and fiction--an invisibility sword; a warrior spinal parasite; an ancient Native American power talisman; fourth dimensional apparitions; Lewis Carroll's (Alice's) looking glass; various power devices that empower and corrupt (a la Bilbo Baggins) etc. etc.  Saul Rubinik shines as the crusty and eccentric curator of this vast warehouse (interior looks like Brobdingnagian blimp hanger). The two agents, played by Eddie McClintock and Joanne Kelly do well enough, and there's a recurring attempt to generate some romantic current between them, but it comes off as rather forced. They play two-dimensional standard characters modeled after who knows how many crime-fighting partnerships where the analytic one is always seesawing with the intuitive one, etc. etc. You will perhaps enjoy four or five episodes; after that it's a pretty predictable pattern with a different McGuffin in each one. Some fun ""steampunk"" props make it interesting for prop-watchers, by the way; Tesla's name comes up a lot.",1436745600,2,1222,5.641304347826087

I am only in episode 2 but look forward to the next 3. I realize I am watching it made in 2010 so if it turns into chasing zombies because of the author Cherie Priest and World War Z, I will hate it. I enjoy the references to Tesla and H.G. Wells and Edgar A. Poe. I hope Jules Vern will also make an appearance. All the characters play together in such a fun way; I find it reassuring that there are mysteries to solve or not.

Still if you enjoy the genre, I think you will find the personality of the characters work well and the CGI, while not so seamless is well crafted and imaginative. I guess the most unique quality of this work is the steampunk-esque blend of the old (as in centuries old historical artifacts) mixed with new technology. It is also weird that members of the Secret Service get drafted into a more secret faction, so its like the Secret Secret Service that the Secret Service doesn't know about.

1. I had never seen it
2. It was available for free with Amazon Prime

4. I like Saul Rubenek

It's an okay show if your suspension of disbelief is set to maximum. The idea is that the warehouse at the end of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" exists and is called Warehouse 13. Saul Rubenek plays the head of a group of ""gatherers and protectors"" of paranormal objects. Each episode centers around the effort by a male/female, regular guy/smart person team to find and acquire or render harmless a dangerous paranormal object.

I think this is our third time through the entire five seasons. I like being able to watch multiple episodes in an evening; there is more continuity in my mind. The acting is excellent in Warehouse 13, and has a sense of lightness, silliness and fun, which I find refreshing. The imaginative sci-fi plots and ideas are creative. The camaraderie of the characters is, of course, its primary pull. There is something appealing about friends who 'have your back'; reliable and trustworthy people who, despite their own quirks and challenges, have your best interest in mind. It is a comfortable and entertaining show to watch.",1432944000,,776,4.7555555555555555

That is where all the action stems from in Warehouse 13!  My 13 year old son and I watch it together.  The episodes are intriguing, they keep your interest and it's great for tweens, because it's clean language with great plots that are irresistible.  The episodes are linked and the whole story grows more fascinating with each one.  I highly recommend.",1430265600,,496,4.709302325581396

3899515,5,B002BWP2IK,"This show is just pure fun. And it's got a lot of nice historical references tossed in that give it a connection to reality. You do have to keep in mind that a 'connection to reality' is as far as it goes. Other than mentioning historical figures and objects they may have possessed, it's not historically accurate.

But it takes those historical references and makes then fun. The show does a great job of developing the characters and making you like them. Over the course of the show you watch them grow as individuals and as a team. And you find yourself genuinely caring about them.

If you enjoy world history and fantasy and adventure genres AND can deal with a show that takes a lot of liberties with history, you should enjoy Warehouse 13.",1429488000,,748,4.533333333333333

3899531,3,B002BWP2IK,"This is kinda of a quirky take on the old Friday the 13th series. Some of the plot ideas are obviously taken from the original but with a twist. Instead of a little shop as a front you have a big government warehouse in the middle of no-where aka not California, or New York. It is watchable, and decently acted. I think it tries to capture whatever it is that makes Eureka work, but just doesn't.",1429315200,,397,4.2368421052631575

3899533,5,B002BWP2IK,"I started to watch this based off of seeing Allison Scagliotti on a video of Table Top with Wil Wheaton, and wanted to see her acting prowess and quickly fell in love with this show. Suffice to say that this show is about 2 detectives that have been chosen to round up rare and potentially dangerous artifacts from around the globe.

I knew nothing of this show when I started to watch and I've been hooked ever since. The best way to describe it is: if Indiana Jones existed today, and had futuristic technology at his disposal, as well as being in a sliver of the X-Files domain.

I highly recommend giving this show a whirl is Science Fiction or Indiana Jones pique your interest.",1429228800,,683,4.456

3899606,5,B002BWP2IK,Great show. All the seasons are good. It is light and fun. If you are seriously into all the vampire stuff and heavy sci fi this isn't it. It is fun and probably something the family could watch together. A thousand times better then the Librarian if you have seen that. Similar.,1427414400,,279,4.384615384615385

Plot points that I was actually interested in went unexplained I wanted answers so badly I couldn't pay attention to the rest of the story. Was there a story? Like other reviewers said, there HAS to be an air of believe-ability for a sci-fi show to work. This had ZERO. How this show got renewed for a second season let alone a 2nd episode and title's like ""V"" got cancelled is beyond me. TV has really taken a dump lately. Sci-fi used to be a good channel to watch too. Anyone else remember the ""Taken"" miniseries? Those were the days.",1426118400,2,616,4.412280701754386

3899712,5,B002BWP2IK,So many science fiction series focus on life in space or fearful monsters.  It is refreshing to watch a series where odd things can and do occur but everything is linked to what many would call common items.  If you enjoy reading or watching scifi you will love watching Pete and Myka hunt down the many items that belong in Warehouse 13.,1425168000,,338,4.435483870967742

If you are looking for a fun, light-hearted adventure comedy, this is for you. I'm enjoying it and look forward to each new episode.",1425081600,,302,4.611111111111111

3899717,5,B002BWP2IK,Season 1 of Warehouse 13 is just fun.  I thought it was going to be a rip on the X-files but it is much more light and fluffy.  The writing and special effects are nothing great but anybody who likes Sci-Fi will find lots to like in the references to history and culture.  The multi-episode plot arcs are nicely done and reasonably suspenseful.  The season is increasingly addictive and well worth watching.,1425081600,,407,4.611111111111111

3899720,2,B002BWP2IK,"I watched 20 minutes of the first episode. It was very contrived and tedious. Put Warehouse on the shelf! If you can't grab me in the first 20 minutes of a pilot, why would I bother watching any more of this series?",1425081600,,215,4.142857142857143
3899721,4,B002BWP2IK,The first season is always the hardest for any show. The cast has to gel with the audience and each other. You have to create a significant interest in their well being. Most of the struggle in the first season seems to be with building a cohesive team while getting the audience to invest in the characters. I think that the first season of Warehouse 13 is certainly doing what needs to be done. The fact that there are several additional seasons points to that. However I don't know that it necessary leaves you panting for the next episode. It is definitely worth watching in order to make your own decision.,1425081600,,611,4.513513513513513
3899722,5,B002BWP2IK,Great show.  Good cast.  Interesting.,1425081600,,37,6.2
3899723,5,B002BWP2IK,"If you stick with this show for the first season and let the characters develop, I can promise you that you'll be hooked and have to watch the following available 4 seasons! The writers have a great sense of humor and don't be surprised if you even learn some history!

usually must be wrapped up in 40 to 50 minutes or so, the leaps and short cuts
to conclusion are less than satisfying.  I'll pass on future seasons.",1424822400,,401,4.527777777777778

3899928,5,B002BWP2IK,"It's silly and dumb at times, but is never apologetic about it. It gleefully embraces its ""SciFi mixed with fantasy"" vibe, with just a touch of steampunk thrown in. The show is fully committed to its nerds-go-on-adventures theme.

It's just good, dorky fun. We don't get enough of that these days. I'm glad (and surprised) it lasted as long as it did, and sorry it didn't last longer.

Bonus for the Eureka crossovers! (Which was an even more dorky but enjoyable popcorn series)",1418774400,,478,4.746987951807229

The premise sounded interesting so I decided to buy this (I waited until it went on sale).  I found the show to be very entertaining. I like the idea of having a ""secret"" warehouse (leave it to the government) with lots of ""paranormal"" objects. Some good laughs and drama. I enjoyed it so much I went ahead and ordered seasons 2 and 3 right away (they were on sale at amazon too).

Warehouse 13 has a similar themed plot and while the story does have it's melodramatic and rather far-fetched moments it does do a few things quite well.  The personalities of the two main characters (Pete and Myka) are a stark contrast to one another which is typical in shows like this (or any show for that matter where two unsuspecting individuals are thrown together as ""partners"") but in this case it works quite well and makes for some interesting and humorous character development and dialogues.  Other main characters also contribute really well to the series, most notably the smart and quirky ""Claudia"" who frequently finds herself caught up in her own mischief.  The artifacts are often pretty cool and the stories, mysterious and engaging so its worth checking out!",1416355200,,960,4.98125

3900015,5,B002BWP2IK,"What a great surprise! I am halfway through the fourth season but I'm commenting on the first season in hopes of encouraging potential viewers to give this show a shot.
I was bored one night cruising for a show to watch and have no idea why I decided to give this show a chance but I am sure glad I did!
The first episode did not grab me right away; it wasn't bad, it wasn't good but something about it did make me want to see where the show's creators were trying to take this.
At first was underwhelmed by the special FX and my initial thought on their gadgets was that the show's budget was holding them back from cooler props and visuals, yet something about the show kept me engaged. I think what kept me engaged was that I wanted to see their explanation of the world they were creating.
The show's strength is the cast and characters, they are all likable and bring  their own unique balance to the group, and as you progress through the seasons the bigger strength is how they mesh together as a family. It seems that the actors genuinely like each other and have bought 100% into the show and their characters, which is evident in the onscreen chemistry and moments where you can believe that the cast is actually laughing or crying with each other in those moments.
The writing is a strength as well as. You are always transported into their world and taken on fascinating adventures in each episode that occasionally have some edge, that usually don't take themselves too seriously, that have some PG-rated humor that only adults will get, but episodes that never get too dark and are never too far from a joke or a laugh. Some episodes you wish they could last an additional 20 minutes or more because the story is moving along so well but then seem to wrap up rather quickly because, I'm guessing, the 42 minute time limit is up.
I have learned to love the steam punky gadgets as they are not the emphasis of the show; they are neither show pieces to show off special effects nor are they crutches in dull spots or where they've written themselves into a corner.
If you are able to suspend belief for the first few episodes and let the characters and the show's premise get fully established the characters will take over and carry you on an entertaining adventure every episode.
My only gripe with show through out has been how they get around so damn fast. It's not so much of a problem but a fun observation that is quickly forgotten, but one that I thought writers were surely doing on purpose and would eventually explain through an ""artifact"", however, I'm still waiting for it half way through the fourth season.
All-in-all it's a great and fun show that most anyone of any age can enjoy. It will endear itself to you before you know it making you sad to know that there are only five seasons.
Give it a watch.",1415491200,,2830,4.4423076923076925
3900016,3,B002BWP2IK,"It's supposed to be 'science fiction' but should be categorized as a techno-fantasy.  I've seen 3 episodes so far so.

The protagonists behave with each others much as 9 or 10 year old brother and sister might squabble which is at considerable odds with their employment as Secret Service agents with considerable experience and senior enough to protect the President.

While it has its moments most viewers will be feel comfortable with it as it employs many familiar cliches.

It's shallow and cartoonish.  For example in the last episode I watched one of the protagonists had a fight with a couple of museum guards and rendered them unconscious either by the blows delivered or from the guards (who are just doing their jobs) hitting their heads on the stone floor.  The protagonists show no concern over the plight of the guards who probably have damage to their jaws and teeth, certainly have concussions, and need medical attention.  Well that's a familiar Hollywood hack.",1415491200,,978,4.96319018404908

It's set in the present but because they are a warehouse full of artifacts, they often delve into the past as well.

3900214,5,B002BWP2IK,"I found this in a bargain bin at my local Barnes & Nobles.  I had been looking for it because it sounded good and it turned out to be really good.  Heres a review of the episodes, with synopsizes from the box.

1. Pilot:  Secret Service Agents Pete Lattimer and Myka Bering re reassigned to chase down reports of supernatural activity and find new objects to store at Warehouse 13 for its caretaker, Artie Nielsen.  An above average start to the show. A-

2. Resonance:  Pete and Myka must stop a team of bank robbers who use an unusual weapon to hypnotize their victims, while Artie pinpoints the Warehouse 13 Security breach.  Starts off great, but the ending could have been better.  A-

3. Magnetism:  Pete and Myka head to upstate New York in search of a mind-altering artifact, while Artie investigates the Warehouses mysterious energy surges.  Now this is an excellent episode through and through.  A+

4. Claudia:  The Warehouses security breach is revealed, and this brings up a dark secret from Arties past.  Another perfect episode that is my second favorite of this season.  A+

5. Elements:  When a thief steals a sculpture with the help of a Native American artifact, Pete and Mykas investigation leads to the discovery of a sacred place  and theyll do all they can to protect it.  A

6. Burnout:  Pete and Myka must complete the dangerous and unfinished mission of a long-dead Warehouse agent who died while on the hunt for an artifact.  A very interesting episode.  A+

7. Implosion:  Pete and Myka return to Washington to intercept a samurai sword to be given to the President, where they discover that someone else is also going after objects that belong in the Warehouse.  A great episode that introduces a great villain.  A

8. Duped:  A simple mission to Las Vegas gets complicated when Myka starts behaving strangely.  The worst episode of the season, but its not bad.  B

9. Regrets:  Pete and Myka investigate a rash of unexplained suicides at a Florida prison.  Meanwhile, Claudia decides to change a light bulb  with the help of an artifact  The Pete and Myka plot is perfect, but the Claudia subplot is a little annoying at times.  Still, I was crying towards the end of this episode, so it deserves a good rating.  A-

10. Breakdown: Pete, Myka and Claudia become trapped in the Warehouse, with energy levels reaching critical mass.  Meanwhile, Artie is questioned by the Regents and Mrs. Frederic.  A

11. Nevermore:  On a visit home, Myka discovers that her father has half of an artifact once owned by Edgar Allen Poe.  Meanwhile, the other half is wreaking havoc in an Oregon high school.  A

12. MacPherson:  The team discovers MacPherson is auctioning artifacts hes siphoned from the Warehouse shelves.  Pete, Myka and Artie track him down, ready to seal his fate, but is it all a trap?  The best episode of the season.  A+

Not only do I already have the next 2 seasons, I also got the first seasons of Alphas (which I also love) and Eureka (which I haven't seen yet but am really looking forward to it) to try.  Looks like the SyFy verse will be one of my favorite shows.",1407974400,,3107,4.634686346863469

3900229,5,B002BWP2IK,"Loved Warehouse 13 when it was on Sci-Fi channel but I missed the last season. I decided to watch the whole show again and it holds up well. The characters are fun and easy to relate to except for the way too beautiful Joanne Kelly (Myka Bering). She is such a fine actor that you forget she was supposed to be the beauty. Eddie McClintock should be in everything, he is that good. Saul Rubinek owns every scene he is in. Allison Scagliotti, what can I say: beauty, fun, physical, comic, manic, someone I would love to have a beer with and wish my son could marry. He feels the same way. I didn't get enough of Genelle Williams but her quiet presence was a great addition to the show. Glad to see the CCH Pounder is going to the new NCIS spin off because she carries enough gravitas to play the first female president. Then there are the stories. So engaging, so fun, so mysterious.

But it is certainly not my type of TV show. The acting is ok, a little exaggerating, typical for kids' shows. It is probably good for kids.

3900248,5,B002BWP2IK,"The series starts off a little slow in how it builds and sets up arcs but it has an excellent premise and quickly becomes fun and engaging.  The actors and actresses generally do a very good job and seem to really enjoy themselves in their roles.  The scenes are usually well shot and directed, and the scoring/music is quite good as well.  Unfortunately, the special effects (particularly the visual effects) are wildly uneven.  They vary between high quality (for television), merely sufficient, and sadly inadequate.. Most often they lean toward the latter most.  The show itself is an excellent diversion, enjoyable to watch or just to have on in the background.  It would seem to be able to appeal to various different groups (individuals, couples, families), has many fun guest stars and only gets better over the course of its run.",1406592000,,838,4.907801418439717

Agents collect artifacts from people who don't understand their power or are using the power for their own selfish gains.

I love the premise of the show, especially all the references to great people throughout history. The dialogue is witty and for the most part natural, and the chemistry is one of the best for a formulaic save the day in 45 minutes kind of show. I can watch this over and over.",1403827200,,567,4.67

The show is well written, and well acted with a combination of drama and humor that really pulls the viewer in. For those who are completely unfamiliar, the show centers around Pete and Mica, two secret service agents who are drafted into a new job gathering artifacts for ""America's attic"" as their new boss Artie nicknamed it. The artifacts are imbued with magical powers, usually by the (famous) person that owned them. Louis Carroll's mirror, Edgar Allen Poe's book and pen, etc... all the artifacts have powers and side effects that range between humorous and deadly.

3900342,5,B002BWP2IK,"This is a great show! It's lots of fun!
If you have enjoyed watching Eureka or some of the other light hearted Science Fiction shows on the SyFy Channel, you might enjoy this show.

The idea behind this premise is that some items are so imbued with and tied to the people and events surrounding them that they contain power. No one can explain why and no one can control this power. So in order to protect the world, these items must be contained.

Warehouse 13 is the thirteenth warehouse, with twelve others before it, and presumably more coming after it. This series follows Mycah, Jake, and several other characters as they travel around the world, collect these items.  During this series though they come across people that want to use the items for personal profit or power or revenge. This only adds to the story and excitement of the story.

Overall, I loved watching this series and will most likely enjoy watching it again.

Worth the money. Enjoy.",1402444800,,959,4.650887573964497

3900344,5,B002BWP2IK,"Have watched this show for years and sorry now it is over.  Love going back to the early episodes and re watching them.  It is a silly premise that has a special group of agents responsible for capturing and neutralizing ""artifacts"" that may be causing trouble in the general population.  The cast is what makes this show work so well.  They are quirky and charming with real weaknesses and they and the show do not take themselves too seriously.  Light entertaining fun.",1402358400,,471,4.695121951219512

3900352,3,B002BWP2IK,"I just finished watching the very last episode of Warehouse 13, and my feelings are somewhat mixed. One the one hand, I really loved the characters and the idea and the kind of Saturday morning cartoons for grown-ups feeling that this show gave me. Unfortunately, the writing gave out during the third season and the show turned into a another jumble of bad cliches, lazy plotting and poorly executed story arcs. There were a few exceptions, but overall the lapse in writing made a good show mediocre.

My advice is to watch season 1 and 2, but only watch 3, 4, and 5 if it's free and you don't have anything better to do. There is one  exception: the episode is Season 5 called ""Savage Seduction"", is actually pretty funny.",1402012800,,724,4.561538461538461

It was entertaining but for me, even fiction has to make some sense.  The warehouse was supposed to be a top secret place and yet they kept adding more and more characters who ended up knowing it.  The storyline about H.G. Wells just didn't make any sense at all.  And you'd think that if the warehouse is supposed to be a secure place to store all of those weird objects, those objects would not be just sitting on shelves from where they could fall off and create chaos.  But those things are the fault of the writers - the acting and the chemistry between the two main characters were decent.",1401580800,,733,4.27536231884058

3900379,5,B002BWP2IK,good show.  often the intro pilots are pretty boring because they have to give you all the background for the entire series in 1 show.  they did all that...plus it was an interesting show.  too bad it's now off the air.,1401062400,,219,4.2926829268292686

The show gets a little long in the tooth in later seasons, but early years, it is worth a look.",1399852800,,393,4.090909090909091

3900408,5,B002BWP2IK,Warehouse 13 was a great show from the start. I enjoyed the stories they told and the characters were all well developed.

This series ,like the series Eureka, had me hooked with episode 1. The casting was perfect. The byplay between the boyish Pete and the fastidious Myka with the erasable Artie thrown in for good measure, made for a great series. I wanted more instantly. This series has it all. Human interaction. Personality conflicts. Villains,. Mysteries to be solved. The sudden appearances of Mrs. Frederic who then just isn't there are priceless. It's a series where you get to know the characters and feel like you're part of the warehouse family. The final two episodes air soon. It's too bad Claudia isn't a real person because when she heard about the show being canceled I know she would have got on her trusty computer and said ""Oh no, you don't stop the Claudiometer !""

Goodbye Warehouse 13 your memories will echo in my vault of forever.

It's a very unique show, with great acting, solid character development, and a really creative blend of history, sci fi, special effects, and of course, fascinating antique artifacts.

3900425,3,B002BWP2IK,"These two clowns are NOT believable as ""Secret Service Agents."" Their constant bickering is juvenile, tedious, and makes the show feel more like a sitcom than a paranormal thriller. Joanne Kelly's ridiculous hair, make-up, and wardrobe, along with her unnaturally-enlarged lips, are a constant, irritating distraction from the story line. Eddie McClintock has all the sophistication and appeal of a fifth grader. Only thing missing is a laugh track. You wanna be able to take Federal Agents seriously, but these two make that impossible.

As for the story line, it's enough to keep you vaguely interested, which is why I grudgingly gave it three stars. But the show's lack of subtlety is a huge problem. The supernatural realm is so conspicuous and easily accessed that it's practically commonplace. This makes an ongoing ""covert"" investigation seem implausible, even unnecessary. You got burglars using music to paralyze multiple victims, magic chairs causing entire groups of people to commit physical (even sexual) assault, robotic parasites jumping on people's backs and controlling their actions... It's all happening in front of scores of witnesses! How could the government possibly be investigating such events ""in secret""? Why even try? I just don't buy it.

If you're looking for something akin to the X-Files or Alias, do yourself a favor and keep it moving.  But if you're not particular, have some time to kill, and can watch for free with Amazon Prime, it's kinda worth watching, I guess. Or, at least you can have it on as background noise while you do other things around the house.",1399420800,,1598,5.138461538461539

Saul Rubinek, who plays Artie, does a great job; he is funny, smart, and the perfect caretaker of the Warehouse 13 where the government stores ""artifacts"" that can be used to commit crimes, injure people, and cause disarray in our lives.

The 4 main characters were already annoying me, and then a new one shows up in episode 4 that comes off like a Juno wanna-be. I couldn't wait for the next episode so she would go away, but then they kept her on as a new main character! Also the lead actress's duck face over inflated fake lips are very distracting and annoying to look at. This would be a good show for kids, but for an adult with a brain it's pretty lame. There is just no depth to it whatsoever.
It's still has a fun concept, and if I had seen this when I was 12 I would have loved it, so I'll give it 3 stars.",1398729600,,887,4.016949152542373

3900455,5,B002BWP2IK,The show is very well done for the limited budget they appear to have.  The main characters (Pete & Micah) are almost sweet and heartwarming to watch.,1398470400,,150,4.555555555555555

3900458,3,B002BWP2IK,This is not a bad drama/mystery/thriller. A little tame and corny but it would be suitable for younger folks a parent wants to remain somewhat unjaded. It's reminiscent of Eureka.,1398297600,,179,5.0
3900459,4,B002BWP2IK,"Entertaining, this series has good plot and very good character development you really get to know the characters Would strongly recommend it.",1398211200,,142,5.5

3900461,1,B002BWP2IK,"Cool idea, terrible execution. Weak acting, corny writing and decent special effects. Reminds me of late night spook shows from the late 80s early 90s.",1398124800,3,151,5.08
3900462,5,B002BWP2IK,Just discovered this show through Amazon Prime.  The acting is great and the writing is clever and witty.  Can't wait to watch all seasons!,1398124800,,139,4.75
3900463,4,B002BWP2IK,"Good and quirky. However, it feels a bit recycled. I'm definitely getting a Fringe vibe with a little Supernatural sprinkled in. I'm curious to see where it goes.",1398124800,,162,4.821428571428571
3900464,5,B002BWP2IK,I love Science Fiction especially the kind that uses special gadgets and such.  I also love the chemistry between between Latimer & Bering.  Artie is great and Claudia really adds to the mix. Thanks for such an interesting and entertaining show.,1398124800,,245,4.951219512195122

3900466,3,B002BWP2IK,It was okay but the show had some stupid ideas at times. I guess the science fiction was a bit much for me at times.,1398038400,,116,3.68

3900470,4,B002BWP2IK,"While the idea of magical ""artifacts in the wild"" that need to be bagged, tagged and stored in the warehouse is very over the top, the characters and story give me lots of laughs.",1397779200,,179,4.294117647058823

3900474,1,B002BWP2IK,1st episode did not draw me in. Looks like the typical male/female love hate relationship. I didn't like the story so far.,1397692800,,122,4.590909090909091

3900477,5,B002BWP2IK,Warehouse 13 is a good fantasy show that keeps everyday thing in the background of Fantasy Generated Objects and it makes you smile at times,1397520000,,140,4.64

3900479,2,B002BWP2IK,Wasn't bad but not worth spending time on to commit to. Better sci fy type shows out there to watch.,1397433600,,100,4.05
3900480,3,B002BWP2IK,It was interesting but very long-winded.  It could have been cut to improve the experience. Some of the premises were very creative.,1397433600,,132,5.0
3900481,5,B002BWP2IK,I enjoy these episodes very much. They have good drama and excellent varity--there is lots of action to keep the sessions alive. One of the better shows in my opinion.,1397347200,,167,4.6

3900483,5,B002BWP2IK,This show is incredibly written. It is exciting to see what kind of artifacts there are from episode to episode. I started watching the series on amazon instant video and was completely disappointed when I found out there were only six episodes left. Love this show and I continue to watch the series over and over again.,1397347200,,321,4.649122807017544

3900485,3,B002BWP2IK,"The series started out pretty exciting, but as time wore on, it became apparent that the series had an agenda.  First of all, Myka is portrayed as the smart one while expressing her sexuality via low tops and tight pants, which I do not really mind too much, but Pete is portrayed as a dummy doing stupid things most of the time.  I  can't imagine professional SS Agents behaving like that.  Also, I did not like the new character Steve and the gay thing with him.  Pretty much screwing up the storyline.  There are several good shows, but some really stupid ones.",1397260800,,564,4.480392156862745

3900494,5,B002BWP2IK,"I've enjoyed this series on SyFy and am loving seeing it on Prime now.
The premise that mystical objects have been collected and stored away so that they can't harm us is very charming.
I like Arnie the caretaker, his mellow amanuensis who has intriguing powers, his assistant who shows up in the 3rd episode and is with us ever after, and of course the two Secret Service agents who are on the front lines most often.
Good concept and lots of fun to watch.",1396742400,,457,4.3882352941176475
3900495,4,B002BWP2IK,Some episodes were a bit dry but over all a good season to watch. Very entertaining as a series. Endearing characters.,1396656000,,118,4.666666666666667
3900496,2,B002BWP2IK,"This show is so far into the unbelievable that it couldn't find its way back, no matter how hard it tried. The acting is OK, but the storyline is so absurd that it's not even entertaining. A true waste of time.",1396656000,,210,4.146341463414634

3900498,4,B002BWP2IK,I enjoy the interaction between the main characters and I always enjoy Mrs. Frederic and Artie.  The show has an interesting premise that there are objects in the world with mysterious properties most of the objects are from historical figures we are familiar with which in my opinion makes it even better.,1396656000,,306,4.884615384615385
3900499,5,B002BWP2IK,I enjoyed watching the series.  I hope Syfy continues the series! I can't wait to finish season 3 and 4.,1396656000,,104,4.2
3900500,2,B002BWP2IK,I liked the idea of the show.  It became increasingly annoying watching the interchange between the two main characters.  It was completely unbelievable that the lead woman was affiliated with the Secret Service.,1396656000,,212,5.393939393939394
3900501,5,B002BWP2IK,I was hooked from the first episode.  This is a really great show. I wish there were more seasons.  Love it. Love it. LOVE IT!,1396569600,,126,4.0
3900502,5,B002BWP2IK,Great show with a strong first season. Season one assembles the cast and arranges the elements of what became my favorite show currently on the air.,1396483200,,148,4.730769230769231
3900503,2,B002BWP2IK,"I gave two and a half episodes a try.
I really liked the premise but the writing and directing seemed so bad that I have to give the cast a pass along with my sympathies.
I hope they were paid well at least and enjoyed their time in Canada.
Somebody mentioned that their characters seem ""high school stupid"" for their apparent age.
I agree. Apparently that's the target audience. No room for Boomers here.
Normally this type of series should be exactly what I crave from being an X-Files etc. fan.
This is just weak. I'm surprised it ever got past the first season.
I guess there's always something for everybody to enjoy in this world .
I'll look for something else.",1396483200,2,667,4.475409836065574

3900524,2,B002BWP2IK,I got 3/4 of the way though the pilot and I just couldn't watch it anymore. None of the characters are engaging and the plot proceeds at a glacial pace.,1395446400,,152,4.1

3900530,5,B002BWP2IK,"I've heard about this series, but never watched it.
Well, I took some time to watch the first episode and enjoyed it thoroughly.
I felt some of the acting was forced and overly done to help create humor and character  bonding but felt the story was good enough without jamming weak humor down our throats'",1395446400,,305,4.545454545454546
3900531,3,B002BWP2IK,It is enjoyable enough to come back for more but lots of holes are not filled (what happened to that magic poker chip) and lots of things that are not believable (like the door to the dark vault magically opens and stays open when the entry keypad is smashed.,1395446400,,259,4.3061224489795915
3900532,5,B002BWP2IK,"This show is a clever concept essentially pitting the forces of government (for the good, oddly enough in contemporary culture) against the mysteries of the unknown and often unknowable mystical forces of the universe manifested in ""artifacts"" that must be collected and corralled.  These artifacts are at the epicenter of disturbances of normalcy in our world which are identified by the curator of Warehouse 13 (it apparently being the 13th in a succession of warehouses all of which have suffered unknown fates in the past) who then send his agents to recover said artifacts, neutralize them and bring them to the warehouse for safe containment.  The warehouse is clearly meant to be the same warehouse that the ""Ark of the Covenant"" from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and the premise is good.  This show takes that original tease from 30+ years ago and runs with it, adding great gobs of pseudo-science and quasi-mysiticsm to add the feel of The Outer Limits while also suggesting a little touch of conspiracy theory in terms of who is actually running things (but not at the fever-pitch of paranoia that the X-files generated).
Overall clean entertaining but not nightmare-inducing fun for 10-and ups (and their parents) to enjoy.",1395446400,,1231,5.0245098039215685

3900537,5,B002BWP2IK,"My 11 year old son and I both really enjoy this show.  It has enough of a story line that is different than the usual cookie cutter types for me and the special effects are great for my boy. Gone is almost all of the dirty words and blood/guts are essentially non-existent. Political agendas are also absent and you don't always know who is good and who is bad in this series.  We just finished watching season (1) and are anxious to start season (2). If you like sci-fi, action adventure and a good story line this is a show worth considering. I believe it will appeal to people across multiple generations and diverse backgrounds.

3900556,4,B002BWP2IK,I really enjoy this show due to its original concept of items being imbued with special properties due to certain life events of their creators or owners. I think Pete and Myka have a great partnership and that Artie is the perfect grumpy old man.,1394323200,,247,4.511111111111111

I've found myself laughing hysterically, and then wiping the tears from my eyes.  Every episode has me looking forward to the next.  As I'm only on the first season I was sad to see that the 5th and final season will be upon us soon. But as it happens in every good book or movie there has to be an ending. Until then, call me

3900561,5,B002BWP2IK,"I have seen every episode of all 4 seasons and can easily say seasons 1 & 2 were far better than season 3, which in turn is better than season 4.

I love the dynamics between Pete and Micah.  Artie is still somewhat of an unknown and is far more eccentric than later seasons.  Mrs Frederic is awesomely mysterious.  The early episodes suffer from the same thing all early episodes suffer from -- but once characters and plot threads settle down, the series is immensely enjoyable.  It is not for hard core science fiction buffs but put your tongue in your cheek, sit back and enjoy.",1394150400,,582,4.452830188679245

The main characters are way too un-interesting, and the second episode did not help it was way to lame for a lack of a better word. The show has potential, maybe I'm giving up on it a bit too early, but if its this bad early on the season I really don't have my hopes up for the rest.",1393977600,,423,3.8735632183908044

This reminds me of an updated ""X-Files"" with humor, but instead of dealing with aliens, the oddities are artifacts. The main characters are likeable, with the exception of Mrs. Frederic who is a bit on the scary side. Pete and Myka, Secret service agents who get transferred unwillingly from their jobs protecting the President to the Badlands of South Dakota to become Warehouse 13 agents, are just opposite enough to create some fun tension, but always manage to complement each others abilities. Artie, the brains and manager of the Warehouse, obviously knows what he's doing, but doesn't let others know more than he wants. Leena, proprietor of Leena's Bed and Breakfast, where the Warehouse Agents live, has the ability to read a person's aura and sense their life force. She also seems to be a friend and counselor to everyone, and appears to want to be more than friends with some of the characters. As the season continues, other characters are brought into the Warehouse and more relationships evolve. All in all, good fun with lots of suspense.",1393891200,,1152,4.852791878172589

The writing is clever (much better than Torchwood, for instance), the acting is good, and the plot is familiar yet entertaining. Anybody who watches Eureka, Dr. Who, Torchwood, or X-Files will feel at home with this show, which may not make it the most original piece of television. Warehouse 13--I'm convinced exists in reality under the guise of an ""Amazon fulfillment center""--is worth checking out.",1393804800,,474,5.089743589743589

3900659,3,B002BWP2IK,I can't comment on this since I have never watched it. My guess is someone visiting watched it. Nice to have the option for visiting guests.,1390867200,,140,4.423076923076923
3900660,3,B002BWP2IK,"I am a sci-fi/fantasy afficianado, and to pull off ""suspension of disbelief,"" you need writers that understand human nature enough to create characters capable of making and learning from their mistakes.  A sense of humor doesn't hurt.  A successful series, in my opinion, needs this along with the usual adventurous risk taking, believable settings and story lines, and episodic endings that leave you wanting more.

That said, this is not the best series out there.  The Myka character is flat with no personality or direction.  Her voice is grating and her condescending attitude is equally irritating.  I like Jack's character but Myka makes a terrible ""straight man"" for Jack's comedic wit.  Talk about opposites!  The Artie character is fun but superficial.  And you just KNOW that Mrs. Fredericks has a teleportation device since she's here one minute and gone the next, but if that's the case, how could she not provide insight into the missing Joshua? Or not have THAT device locked up in the warehouse for safekeeping?  The best thing this series does is to bring in the Claudia character.  I'd watch this series just to see her!  The writers certainly did this character justice, and she's so much fun you have to just fall in love with her!  She has the most depth, but all of the characters in this series are pretty superficial.

This series reminds me of Fringe meets Indiana Jones meets X-Files.  The warehouse idea clearly comes from the Indiana Jones series.  The characters, interaction and story lines are similar to Fringe.  But unlike Fringe, which was one of the best series EVER, this one leaves you with a ""take it or leave it"" feeling after each episode.  I mean, who made all of these ""artifacts"" and, if they're such bad news, why aren't they destroyed?  The writers would have us believe that there are quite literally millions of ""magical"" items lurking, lying in wait for us to happen across?  And that all of these would be safely housed in some regular, broken down warehouse in the middle of nowhere?  With one part-time guy minding the store?  Hey, a couple of well placed implosion bombs and that warehouse would be toast and no worries for anyone.  Anybody think about that?

If you've got nothing better to do and no other, better series to watch, this is a good way to kill some time.  But if you want quality Sci-fi, stick with the likes of Fringe, X-Files, SG1, and to a lesser extent, Falling Skies.",1390867200,,2441,4.768496420047732
3900661,4,B002BWP2IK,"This is another good scifi network show. Good characters with good chemistry. Too bad the network always cancels these shows after 5 seasons or so...But, they continue to come out with good replacement shows so that's OK, I guess.",1390867200,,230,4.923076923076923
3900662,1,B002BWP2IK,This show was not what I was expecting. Did not care for the story line. Did not finish watching one show.,1390867200,,106,4.095238095238095

3900664,5,B002BWP2IK,"I love this show. I watched it first on Netflix and have loved it every since. Now with the final season coming soon(*sobs*), I'm watching the entire four seasons over again. I love Pete's randomness, Myka's intelligence, Claudia's sass, Artie's sarcasm, Mrs. Frederick's ninja-like entrances, and Steve's deadpan humor. I'm going to miss it when it ends.....But I suggest you watch this show...If you love supernatural, funny, and thrilling shows, this is the one for you!",1390608000,,473,5.2368421052631575
3900665,2,B002BWP2IK,"Poor to good acting at best. Some of the content is too silly. A grown man acting like a child doesn't seem to fly for an FBI agent. I know people have a sense humor, but it seems childlike. I had my hopes up and set my bar on X-Files. But felt more like gmGOONIES",1390521600,,264,3.8181818181818183

3900668,3,B002BWP2IK,Its a good series but not much to expect. Some of the episodes are really boring. Found second season better than first.,1390435200,,120,4.5
3900669,4,B002BWP2IK,I enjoyed it but my wife could not sit through a single episode because she thought it was so ridiculous and unrealistic. I obviously enjoy fantasy more than she does.,1390435200,,167,4.6
3900670,5,B002BWP2IK,I love the Syfy channel and decided to watch one of there series and got hooked on the show. I enjoy science fiction since I was a child and still do and I'm in my 60's.  Can hardly wait to start to Season 2,1390348800,,207,3.7045454545454546
3900671,5,B002BWP2IK,"This show has it all! I am a huge fan of the supernatural eg. the X-Files, Supernatural, Eureka, etc. This show held my interest from day one and I've found myself cursing the off-season days awaiting each new season. The characters are very well-developed and often quirky and hilarious. Every episode is action packed with its' own mission. I give it two thumbs up and a bowl of popcorn! My friends and I got through a whole winter watching this show on Netflix for our weekly girls' night adventure. It appealed to all of us despite our differences in tastes and interests. Good job, Eddie McClintock!",1390262400,,604,4.7075471698113205

3900679,5,B002BWP2IK,OK magical objects must be stored and protected to keep society safe. What is amazing is the enormous number of objects and size of the ware house. The team never disappoints with entertaining drama action and comedy. It just makes it so believable that you want to join the team.,1389830400,,280,4.62
3900680,5,B002BWP2IK,"Fun show to watch.  It is quirky and strange, but that's what this show is all about.

3900686,5,B002BWP2IK,"This show was an unexpected winner! It subtlely takes you in and grabs you, and makes you laugh, makes you feel nostalgic (if you like sci-fi and enjoyed those kind of shows) and keeps you involved, with good feelings.  A little feeling of star trek reminiscing (with some of thestars as well!) a little feeling of fringe, some seriousness of x files, and mix it up with the old time spy comedy of get smart (but in a modern, NOT slapstick way) and occasionally throw in some ghost busters nad indiana jones ... and more.

The gadgets are fabulous, and the one-liners are funny without anyone telling you that they are ""very funny!""  Every time I see Artie put something into the warehouse shelves, I am reminded of the last scene in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" when they shoved the box which house the Ark of the Covenant into a huge warehouse.  So we know where the Ark is - it's in Warehouse 13, and Artie has is catalogued!!",1389398400,,535,4.621052631578947
3900707,4,B002BWP2IK,I find this show entertaining. It is like Indiana Jones meets National Treasure. (I hate when they make you add more words to submit your review when you've already said what you wanted to!!),1389398400,,191,4.647058823529412
3900708,4,B002BWP2IK,"I was able to catch a few of these shows when it was first on, but couldn't keep up on it. Now with Prime, I'm watching the entire series. Good show, though I'm not too fond of the two main characters. Artie and Claudia, though are great and save the show. As in all series, some of the shows are better than others, and I won't list any specifics as everyone will have there own favorites. But it's a cool show to watch, and sci-fi/fantasy fans should enjoy it.",1389398400,,462,4.202247191011236
3900709,5,B002BWP2IK,"i have been a long, loyal doctor who fan for decades, but I have to tell you, having seen all of the series, especially series four, this show is as good as anything in the fifty years (yes, I have seen them all) as put out, and I am very pleased that this is the north American answer to doctor who.

I enjoy the fact that all of the protagonists are flawed, and, yet loveable;  I love the, ""madcap,"" I enjoy the wit, and watching the actors grow into their roles as well as the improved writing--every series stronger than the previous one.

in short, if you enjoy doctor who, and are true fan of the series, you will enjoy WAREHOUSE 13.  I was extremely sorry to see it go.

by the way, I gave the five stars for the entire four seasons, not just the pilot.  Really, give it a chance.",1389312000,,787,4.144736842105263

3900711,4,B002BWP2IK,"I enjoyed the ""tongue in cheek"" humor of the science fiction as well as the amusing relationships of the characters.

3900713,5,B002BWP2IK,Original and entertaining.  An interesting take on a scifi series.  If you like creative scifi you're likely to like this.,1389225600,,122,5.05
3900714,5,B002BWP2IK,It is very entertaining and i love the actors.  It is diffferent from all the other sci fi i've seen.,1389225600,,101,4.05
3900715,5,B002BWP2IK,I love this show I've watched all 4 seasons over and over again .... I couldn't get enough of pete and micca and that sooo hot assistant of artie's wow.  anyway yeah its a great series and I hated for it to end,1389139200,,210,3.883720930232558
3900716,4,B002BWP2IK,I have enjoyed getting introduced to this show.  The story itself is interesting.  The two main characters get me laughing all the time at their interactions.  Can be a bit cheesy at times but that might be because it is a little older a show.,1389139200,,243,4.355555555555555
3900717,4,B002BWP2IK,Actually a pretty good show. The characters are fun and some of the stories are interesting. I like that each episode is complete within itself yet there is a connection between them.,1389139200,,183,4.75
3900718,4,B002BWP2IK,"It's rare to find a new idea in sci fi that's interesting, compelling and (almost) believable. Combine that with some very good character development, good acting and good writing and you've got something. This was a hit because of the characters, I think, as much as it was because of the premise and the plot devices. And even though it's a little hard to believe that this is possible, it's not so hard that we can't imagine a world where this is possible, or a group of people we'd rather explore it with. The quirky, and likeable characters make it though, and I found myself being entertained by most episodes. I also like a sci fi series that isn't too preachy (about social problems, e.g.), and doesn't take itself too seriously (Eureka is like that too).
4 out of 5 because it just seems so unbelievable that the world has to be saved from artifacts every week. I know they need to keep it interesting, but 'suspended disbelief' has its limits.",1389139200,,953,4.578947368421052
3900719,3,B002BWP2IK,"Syfy has hits and misses and this is a little bit of both.  In general, it's a fun romp through supernatural items located in standard world places, but there are some gaping plot holes and some very frustrating characters.

I mostly watch it when I'm not sure what else I want to watch because it's good time filler.  I wouldn't call it a show I love though.",1389139200,,359,4.3283582089552235

3900724,5,B002BWP2IK,"It has all the action, dma, and comedy I would expect to love. The explanation to artifacts beginnings is still not found, but that's what ties you down to discovering the unique story created by Warehouse 13. It's a show that develops with some room to let you figure out yourself what is going on. It's just utterly amazing, by my standards of course.",1389052800,,353,4.53125

Character development is good over the years. Hope SyFy doesn't cancel another good show. I think the only thing really wrong with the show is the network it's on.

I would recommend this show to my friends.",1388966400,,379,4.263888888888889

3900731,4,B002BWP2IK,"I have been watching these Warehouse 13 episodes on the treadmill and love them. They have clever but relatively simple plots with appealing characters, some suspense and a bit of humor. There is no gratuitous sex or violence. The episodes build sequentially to some extent. The references to history are charming as is the overall plot premise -- a secret warehouse in remote South Dakota where artifacts with supernatural powers are collected and safely stored.",1388966400,,463,5.1866666666666665
3900732,3,B002BWP2IK,It's creative.  Not the same ol thing like a doctors show or a crime show. I also like the actors,1388880000,,97,3.85

3900734,3,B002BWP2IK,Solid history pieces and limited violence. Always enjoy when SciFi mixres with history.  Some of the script lines make one smile.,1388880000,,129,5.142857142857143
3900735,5,B002BWP2IK,"Had seen Warehouse 13's past seasons, but had not seen the series pilot or first season.  This explained several plot lines that are alluded to in subsequent seasons.  A great beginning to a super series.",1388880000,,204,4.8

The two agents that used to be Secret Service are sent all over the world on assignments to find these ""artifacts"" that are causing problems in peoples' lives. It is fun to see what happens to them as they collect these artifacts and try to bring them to the warehouse.",1388707200,,434,4.506329113924051

3900751,2,B002BWP2IK,The first couple episodes of Warehouse 13 were just good enough to keep me interested enough to watch 4 or 5 episodes.  Then I realized the writing and the acting were not going to get any better so I stopped watching.  This might be a good series for the 10  14 age group.,1388620800,,273,4.113207547169812
3900752,3,B002BWP2IK,Watched half a season and lost interest. It was OK but I just thought it was a bit far fetched. I never really appreciated the characters. Their personal problems were too easily solved at the end of an episode. Too convienent.,1388534400,,227,4.560975609756097

It beat my expectations, and have started watching Season 2.",1388361600,,251,5.097560975609756

3900768,5,B002BWP2IK,"Really enjoyable show, in so many ways. It's got a satisfying mix of adventure, historical atmosphere, and character evolution - just the right amount of each ingredient, and not too much of any one to be tedious and boring. I love the concept of gathering artifacts that have strange powers imbued by people in places and history, and anything goes in an unlimited universe. The characters are great and the actors do a fine job bringing them to life. My favorite character is Claudia and her relationships with Artie and Jinksy are pure gold. The first season was fantastic and every season gets better and better. I've seen them all and now I'm sad to see it end.",1388275200,,666,4.6525423728813555

The streaming or whatever you call it is slow and sometimes we have to wait for it to catch up (a little frustrating).
Over all we give the program a 4 star.",1387756800,,299,4.0508474576271185

3900782,4,B002BWP2IK,"Well, you'll have to suspend ALL disbelief for the premise, but get past that and it's just plain fun. Interesting, quirky characters make the show along with some great one-liners. Safe enough to watch with kids, it's surprisingly clean of graphic sex (some innuendos off and on), gore, and the depressing story lines that are so common these days. You can have fun and a few insights on the human condition without the dreck. Lots of fun that I enjoy watching with my college-aged daughter and she enjoys watching with me.",1387497600,,524,4.769230769230769

3900788,4,B002BWP2IK,"If you like science fiction with a investigative twist, this is an enjoyable show. The characters are interesting, well played, and likable. The male/distaff tension is nicely done and adds to the story line. Maybe not Emmy material, but good entertainment.",1387238400,,257,5.2926829268292686
3900789,4,B002BWP2IK,I love the special effects in this series. You also get to learn a bit of history as they sci fi their way through the episodes. I recommend!,1387238400,,141,4.071428571428571

3900794,5,B002BWP2IK,"Sweet show with great quirky stories and memorable characters. How many other action-adventures can you say that about? Maybe The Princess Bride. It's a continuing story in the ""quest"" tradition - you'll see.",1386979200,,208,5.333333333333333
3900795,5,B002BWP2IK,hadn't heard of this series until amazon listed it as a suggestion i might like; we gave it a try and my wife and i both love it,1386979200,,128,3.607142857142857
3900796,4,B002BWP2IK,I love SyFy and this actually gives me a fill when I need a little un-reality in my life. The idea behind the artifacts have special powers is definitely imaginative and interesting.,1386979200,,182,4.71875
3900797,3,B002BWP2IK,Not my cup of tea. Once the pilot was over the series seemed a little slow and predictable. I watched 6 episodes.,1386892800,,113,4.181818181818182
3900798,4,B002BWP2IK,Overall it's a good quirky show that is great to watch commercial free on amazon. I had never heard of the show till I stumbled on to it looking for something to watch.,1386892800,,168,4.121212121212121

3900800,5,B002BWP2IK,After Eureka was looking for something to similar stumbled on to this. I enjoy this show as well. Love the comedy in the show. I find my self waiting to see what artifact it will be this episode that will start the trouble !!!,1386806400,,226,4.159090909090909
3900801,5,B002BWP2IK,Best SyFi Channel series of its time... great story line and adorable characters. Continuity of tge stoy lin is never ending,1386547200,,124,4.9523809523809526
3900802,3,B002BWP2IK,Unique show.  The artifacts used are imaginative and add to the color.  I've only watched the first 5 or 6 episodes so far and hope that the characters continue to develop.,1386460800,,172,4.516129032258065
3900803,4,B002BWP2IK,It is an entertaining show.  The show has an original theme to it that is different and imaginative.  Will watch again when time permits.,1386460800,,137,4.666666666666667
3900804,5,B002BWP2IK,I am enjoying the time I spend with these characters. the concept is good. it has been done before but not as good as it is here.,1386374400,,129,3.814814814814815
3900805,3,B002BWP2IK,Really cheesy but addictive. Acting is poor but each program has a new twist to it. Late late night entertainment.,1386374400,,114,4.75
3900806,4,B002BWP2IK,"One of those series that keeps you wanting to watch just one more before bed. Each episode has a plot, and the series has one as well. Good interaction between characters. After cutting the cord to tv several years ago this is the first series I've watched since getting my first tablet.",1386374400,,287,4.538461538461538

3900809,5,B002BWP2IK,"I tripped across the quirky series and fell in love with it. It's just plain fun to watch. No drama, no reality garbage, just a nice show.",1386201600,,138,4.148148148148148
3900810,5,B002BWP2IK,"This show is absolutely entertaining! It's very well written and it's easy to believe that what you are seeing is for real. The characters are believable and work well off of each other. I can see that this show could continue for a long, long time and never run out of new ideas.",1386201600,,280,4.30188679245283

3900813,5,B002BWP2IK,"Love this series! It's ""The X-files meets Moonlighting"". A loveable pair of government agents are recruited to protect the world from all ""supernatural"" things  in the universe that go bump in the night. From the oddball to the sinister, ""his"" gut feelings combined with ""her"" systematic attention to detail create the perfect pair. Throw in a quirky manager, a homeless girl genius, the ""witchy"" Leena (in the best of ways) and the mysterious ""Mrs. Frederick"" and you have a cast of characters you will just fall in love with!
Warehouse 13 is brain candy at it's best. Something sweet to enjoy!",1385769600,,595,4.891089108910891
3900814,5,B002BWP2IK,"I find the cast to be excellent actors, and the basic storyline to be very interesting. I like the sci-fi twist on the belief that paranormal researchers hold, that an object or place can hold residual energy from past owners or events. Not the best sci-fi I've seen, but certainly entertaining enough to deserve a great rating.",1385683200,,328,4.771929824561403
3900815,4,B002BWP2IK,"Great show , concept and performance by most actors. Fantastic sound tracks!!!! You don't have to love riding motorcycle to love this show. It will easily get you involved without losing interest all the way through the 5th season!",1385683200,,231,4.948717948717949
3900816,3,B002BWP2IK,Pretty bad acting but the plot is ok although predictable. The pace of the show was pretty slow as well.,1385510400,,104,4.25
3900817,1,B002BWP2IK,the show is not believable.  Poor acting.  It can't seem to decide whether it wants to be a drama or a comedy.,1385510400,,110,3.9545454545454546
3900818,4,B002BWP2IK,"As long as you accept this for a low-budget show of the sci-fi genre, you should enjoy this series.  The characters are fun, if not the best actors, and the story lines are entertaining.",1385337600,,186,4.470588235294118
3900819,4,B002BWP2IK,"I'd probably give it 3.5 stars, but I like to round up.  It is an interesting show to watch a few episodes, but I just don't identify well with a character that is a high-ranking secret service agent, yet comes off as being a little dumb.  But I can see why people like the show itself.",1385164800,,286,4.089285714285714
3900820,5,B002BWP2IK,Love it. Wish there were a lot more seasons. Great cast. Very addicting  can't get enough of this show. We watch with our children they love it.,1385078400,,144,4.333333333333333
3900821,5,B002BWP2IK,"Great imagination!

Characters are interesting and the stories behind the artifacts are creative. It's like the Librarian movies and maybe a bit of X-files with humor!",1385078400,,167,5.423076923076923
3900822,4,B002BWP2IK,This  is a really different type of show.  Kind of a more timely mission impossible with a science fiction feel to it.,1384819200,,118,4.318181818181818
3900823,2,B002BWP2IK,"Warehouse 13, Season 1 Pilot, Hard to follow. I kept watching it thinking it would get better. It never did. It was hard to follow",1384819200,,130,4.24
3900824,4,B002BWP2IK,"This show is fun to watch but hard to suspend disbelief when watching the special effects. It is also and hard to believe the ""magic"" of the situations which are so far from possible that cannot be considered scifi. I like the humor of the show and love the characters. It is entertaining and mysterious. I like the warehouse and all the artifacts in it and I would recommend the show to all scifi fans.",1384646400,,403,4.386666666666667

3900827,5,B002BWP2IK,This is really a fun show to watch!  It reminds me of a cross between X Files and Fringe but with more comic relief. The characters are great together.  The show's underlying topic of artifact retrieval allows for many episodes of creative content.  Watching season 2 now and loving it so far too.,1384473600,,297,4.566037735849057
3900828,3,B002BWP2IK,"This show could be awesome (and at times it really is).  The stories are all intriguing but, in my opinion, the acting leaves a lot to be desired.  To me, most of the time the actors seem to be kept on a short leash by the director and are unable to really ""let loose"" and be free to use their full potential as artists (the entire cast has tremendous potential).  For a diversion, I enjoy Warehouse 13, but it is not at the top of my ""must see"" list.  I would watch for free as a Prime Member for sure... but would think twice before paying for any of these episodes again.",1384387200,,574,4.098214285714286

3900831,3,B002BWP2IK,"after watching a couple of episodes, I discontinued the series. there just isn't enough meat in the episodes to keep me interested...too much emphasis on the actors and lame humor than on the story and experiences....the episodes feel TOO structured, like the directors/producers are trying too hard.",1384387200,2,300,5.404255319148936
3900832,4,B002BWP2IK,A fun show. The caricature is good. The picture is clear. I liked watching the show. It's just very fun.,1384387200,,104,4.25
3900833,2,B002BWP2IK,Not my type of show.  I have had trouble getting into the series.  I find the plots to be unrealistic.,1384387200,,102,4.05

3900836,3,B002BWP2IK,Sci fi lite. Fun for the family. Nicely done and cute. But this is no Battlestar Galactica!  Come on syfi channel.,1384214400,,114,4.428571428571429
3900837,4,B002BWP2IK,The premise is interesting - who knows what the government has hidden away?  The characters are quirky and amusing; the plots little far fetched at times but it's still fun to watch.,1383955200,,182,4.6875

3900839,5,B002BWP2IK,just a really well done series. It does not try to make believe but it makes you use and enjoy your own imagination.,1383782400,,116,4.086956521739131
3900840,5,B002BWP2IK,"Warehouse 13 is smart and funny; it doesn't assume that its viewers have the intelligence level of half-trained baboons but instead doesn't hesitate to reference literature,  music, TV & movies, sometimes with little more than just a piece of a line that the writers assume we have the brains to catch onto and integrate. It's nice to find a show that doesn't dumb down, but that actually teaches, and it's a shame that they've chosen to end it in just the 5th season. As for the ""great pipes""...Man! can Claudia sing or what? if the show hadn't already captured me, the music would have managed the job quite nicely. Shame on ScyFy for bowing to whatever twisted pressure to end this, probably to be replaced by zombies or monsters. Time to go back to reading books, I suppose...Guess it's good they don't care about their viewers...like whether they keep them.",1383696000,,862,4.746666666666667

3900846,5,B002BWP2IK,"warehouse 13 is actually pretty good,  this show is not  just your monster or villain of the week type show,  it has it's own ground story aspect that help keeps you in tune to like the characters to see what happens to them next.",1383350400,,230,4.181818181818182
3900847,3,B002BWP2IK,Warehouse 13 great story line.  The acting leaves a little to desire but as awkward as it is at times it still provides a humorous entertainment value.  I love the creativity of the writers and the gadgets they come up with.,1383177600,,224,4.439024390243903
3900848,5,B002BWP2IK,"SyFy has always been a favorite of mine. With Warehouse 13, I enjoy the mixture of the supernatural with historical artifacts. These artifacts have dangerous powers and so have to be kept in the middle of nowhere for public safety. The plots are clever, as special agents have to retrieve an escaped artifact or track down a new one causing havoc in the world.",1383177600,,360,4.640625
3900849,4,B002BWP2IK,"It would be just like our ""smart"" government to have a ""secret"" department that had to track down and hide wierd stuff  without ever trying to find out what made it tick.

3900858,4,B002BWP2IK,This program provides light entertainment. Quirky personalities portrayed by the actors create some of the boxes from which they have to escape and also their means of escape at times. Nothing deep here and nothing deep intended. This is just for fun and reminds me of Dr. Who.,1382918400,,277,4.791666666666667
3900859,4,B002BWP2IK,"Enjoyable characters and setting, with natural - but slow by today's standards - evolution of plot. Not much Syfy can be said to be comfortable, cozy (sometimes dozy) viewing.

The acting is good and nobody has to be superhuman to pull off the plots.  Conceptually it's unlikely, but that's actually a big part of the allure of the thing, it's a fantasy show.  When you look at it from a deeper perspective and pay attention to the details it is surprisingly well written and researched.  The only reason I don't rate it higher is that the recurring plot can , at times, become tiresome.",1382400000,,571,4.4

3900881,3,B002BWP2IK,"mixing sassy ""juvenile"" dialogue among the main characters with a pretty good premise makes this series more about relating to the ""selfie, twitter age group"" than to those of us who subscribe to more thoughtful, MATURE fare!  lots of superficial dazzle and ""B-Movie"" graphics doesn't help either.  Shallow, cheap thrills!!  Won't be bothering with viewing balance of season two or all of season three.",1380412800,,402,5.25
3900882,5,B002BWP2IK,"Fun show! Good sci-fi. I give it five stars because it is original, clean and fun to watch.

3900896,4,B002BWP2IK,"I wasn't really expecting to like this show to be honest. When it first started it seemed corny and more of a office-romance type concept. Then the cool stuff started happening and laser guns started blasting people. That made it much more interesting. Every episode (that I've seen so far) unveils some new item or lost treasure that has a secret power. From the aspect of unexpected creativity, the show is pretty cool. I'd recommend at least watching the first five or six episodes to get a feel for the show.",1379462400,,512,4.637362637362638

3900898,2,B002BWP2IK,"I hate this show!  It's too silly for words.  I bought the first season because I fell for the rave reviews and in a nutshell, this show is far too campy.  I can't believe it has such a following because in my estimation, the 2 main characters are not compatible at all.  The juxtaposition of old science and new comes across just as unbelievable as the characters.  I will immediately resell this set.",1379376000,,402,4.4520547945205475

What a fun way to brush up your historical knowledge than to watch Mica and Pete solve the artifact mysteries!  My boys are 10 and 14.  We do not watch a lot of TV.  This was one we picked to watch as a family and it has proved to be a good choice.  It is OK for the kids (rating), and holds dads attention (action) enough to be enjoyable!  Good Job!.",1378771200,,526,4.138613861386139
3900913,4,B002BWP2IK,"Warehouse 13 is not new in its formulaic use of the science fiction genre. It has the usual cute girl and hunky ex-frat boy type, whose actions can be predicted far in advance.  The entire thrust of the story line is held together by Saul Rubinek who plays super nerd Artie. There is a major studios collection of CGI's which are pretty damn good most of the time. Overall, I feel that this show is not time wasted as SO many other shows are, like Revenge. (insert your own candidate here) Check Warehouse 13, out, it actually has some funny bits.",1378771200,,547,4.415841584158416

Since this particular season has come out, of course Seasons 2 and 3 have also come out and I am looking forward to purchasing Season 4 when I have the money to purchase it.  I really enjoy the various actors;  Joanne Kelly is really great as Secret Service Agent Myka Bering and Eddie McClintock and Saul Rubinek are really fantastic.  I also enjoy watching Allison Scagliotti as new agent Claudia Donovan; she is super cool.  Anybody who likes science fiction TV shows will really enjoy this show as well as Eddie McClintock loves being a part of something that's really cool in his mind.  I should also say that Saul Rubinek has become a favorite actor now because of his earlier role he had on ""Star Trek, The Next Generation"" where a character he played there literally abused Brent Spiner's character of Data in a particular episode.",1378425600,,956,4.627218934911243

The interactions between all of the main characters in this show make you want to tune in week after week.  The creative storylines are also a lot of fun.  The show never takes itself too seriously.

The premise of the show involves two secret service agents recruited by the mysterious Mrs. Frederic and reporting to the grumpy Artie to collect supernaturally powerful artifacts.  Their standing orders are to ""snag it, bag it, and tag it"" and store everything in the top secret Warehouse 13

The show had a nice 4 season run which makes it worth investing the time in watching, and SyFy gave it a 6 episode arc to close out the series.",1378252800,,762,4.734848484848484

3900935,3,B002BWP2IK,"This show is enjoyable, just not smart, challenging, or memorable. That doesn't really mean anything either, my real problem is that there's nothing about the show that makes sense. Allow me to illustrate. Eureka exists within the same fantasy as Warehouse 13 and while most of the ""science"" used in Eureka is completely fiction, there is an attempt to reconcile cause, effect, policy, and interpersonal relations. For instance, if an artifact in Eureka cannot be explained, it is studied and held under close scrutiny and high security as with THE artifact in Section 5. Such items are considered extremely rare in Eureka. In Warehouse 13, every famous person in the history of the world created some precious and powerful Artifact, now residing in or soon to reside in Warehouse 13. The best example I can give you is that of the large Looking Glass, that allows your reflection to interact independently from you, from which a tag dangles identifying its owner as Lewis Carrol. There is never any attempt to explain how these items came into being, just that they need to be collected.
It's a show without an identity. Either it is 1) mindless entertainment for the family, then spoiled by inappropriate language and innuendo,  2) an adult sci-fi mystery ruined by shallow writing and a massive silly streak, or 3) a program specifically designed by the writers to be an easy paycheck. They just print up the formula with blanks to fill in like a Mad Libs book. None of which really allows the show to give viewers a reason to keep watching with any real investment.",1377907200,,1569,4.83271375464684

Claudia is my favorite character, she is full of wit, and smart. Mrs. Fredericksburg is next, she is mysterious, and runs the ship. Artie keeps everyone in line in a bungling way. Keep the series coming. I've enjoyed every episode!",1376352000,,350,4.754098360655738
3900964,5,B002BWP2IK,"I could want the show over and over again.  I love the mix of history and fiction. The basic story is artifacts are items connected to some historical or mythological figure or event. Each artifact has been imbued with something from their creator, user, or a major event in history. The Job of the warehouse agents is to ""tag and bag"" those items.  WIth a mix of dark humor and clever writing.. Warehouse 13 doesn't disappoint.",1376352000,,428,4.618421052631579

3900970,3,B002BWP2IK,"Like my title states, this feels like an attempt at copycatting the Walterverse created by JJ Abram's Fringe.  If it had succeeded it would've been fine and entertained.  First the similarities.
1. Both are cop shows, both FBI secret divisions.
2. Both secret FBI divisions deal with ""fringe"" science events that are to be kept from the general public for our own good.
3. Warehouse 13 tries to conjure an eccentric but comically loveable intellectual in, similar to Fringe Division's Walter Bishop.
4. Both feature a reserved and frustrated female lead not getting the professional recognition they so richly deserve.
There are more similarities but the above is more than adequate for my meager review.  Check it out for yourself.  Now, on to the differences within the above similarities and in my humble opinion where the show fails.  This review is about Warehouse 13, so although I think it is an attempt at a Fringe clone I'll refrain from detailing where Fringe may have gotten right what this show did not.
1. Warehouse 13's secret division feels unfunded, neglected and ostracized from legitimacy.  Given the mind boggling immensity of the title's namesake warehouse and the funding that would be commensurate with it's size, it simply is not believable.  Case in point; Las Vegas, Nevada's ""the Area"" which may or may not be fictitious, is openly discussed by local military and civilians alike.
2. Warehouse 13 is huge and full.  The show would have us believe that there are so many unexplained, paranormal events or X-Files if you will, that a warehouse of this proportion, if not larger is needed.  Where did the money to build this colossus come from?  Again, I don't buy it, it just doesnt add up.
3. The unmemorable female agent, formerly a star until her latest mission is botched by her arrogance and lack of teamwork with her soon to be warehouse partner, looks out of place and not at all like a G-woman.  She reminds me of a reality show contestant pretending to be an Agent.  She embodies the cunning of a Girl Scout selling Thin Mints.
I wanted a new show and sadly will have to look further than Warehouse 13.",1376265600,,2135,4.787465940054496

3900972,5,B002BWP2IK,"With Amazon Prime you can watch first three seasons for free on Roku.  It's the kind of mystery/adventure that leaves you smiling at the end.  Much like Eureka while there are bad guys, sometimes even they manage to be rehabilitated.  Unlike Dexter and Breaking Bad, there is a lighter, sweeter quality to the way in which tales are told. Each episode leaves you smiling.",1376179200,,371,4.765625

3900980,5,B002BWP2IK,Very entertaining.  I don't know why I didn't watch every episode when it was originally broadcast.  Need more this good.,1376006400,,121,5.0

3900987,1,B002BWP2IK,Couldn't get into it. The storyline is very unsophisticated and lacks the ability to keep you interested. More appropriate for young teens.,1375660800,,139,5.363636363636363

3900995,4,B002BWP2IK,This is a very fun and enjoyable TV show.  It is so obviously off the charts from reality that it is interesting and it also has internal congruity.  It is cute and it doesn't take itself too seriously.  Even the arch villain is more of a caricature than an ugly evil force.  Very nice sy-fy!,1375574400,,292,4.254545454545455
3900996,5,B002BWP2IK,"This show does not take itself too seriously.  Think X Files with a sense of humor.  As far as scifi goes, some may think it's a little cheesy, but for me, that is part of the charm.  I love the characters they have created, and as the series goes on, the backstories are filled in nicely.  Pete's cultural references make me smile, as do his impressions.  Pete and Myka have as good chemistry as a platonic relationship allows.  As I watch more seasons, the show grows on me more and more.",1375488000,,490,4.329670329670329

3901000,4,B002BWP2IK,"Lighthearted science fiction that's just fun to watch.  It's the characters that really make the show interesting, the way they play off each other, and the stories aren't too bad either.  The show started off a little slow but seemed to get more interesting with each episode.  Season one had a bang-up of an ending, so I'm off to watch season two to see how things work out.  Good entertainment.",1375228800,,397,4.628571428571429

3901002,4,B002BWP2IK,It is a good funny move.  There is a lot of pro acting in the part of the main actors. The plot and development is quite amusing.

3901008,4,B002BWP2IK,Was a little skeptical when I watched the pilot but by the third show I knew I had to finish the season. It's slightly predictable but still fun to watch. Started Season 2 already.,1375056000,,180,4.323529411764706
3901009,1,B002BWP2IK,"Got the ""did you know"" email from Amazon Prime. Did I know that I was entitled to ""free"" streaming video with my Prime membership? No, I didn't. So I went online and tried it. I have a reliable 50 mbps internet service, no problems at all with Pandora, Netflix, iTunes, etc. The third time (in the first 10 minutes) Amazon told me my speed was 384k therefore not fast enough for streaming, I shut down the service and watched the show on Netflix. No problems, of course. Show was great, service on Amazon was not.

A little Haunted Collector with a big dose of Supernatural and give it a cheap history lesson and it comes to Warehouse 13. Not extremely witty at times but with a limited budget and no big network hassle it works well. If you liked Supernatural or Haunted Collector this will fit right in. Hmmmm. Wonder why so many shows and movies have recovering alcoholics in them now?,1374796800,,498,4.670454545454546

3901027,3,B002BWP2IK,"There's a scene at the end of ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" where, after they've wrested the Ark of The Covenant  from the Nazi's, who got it first, the Ark of The Covenant is seen being taken by forklift to its resting spot in a US Federal warehouse, the implication being that, as awful as its powers have been demonstrated to be, being ""lost"" in a government warehouse (as the retreating camera suggests will happen) is about the same as being lost in the desert, so we're all safe.  This is where the premise of Warehouse 13 picks up, using of course the cultural knowledge of Area 54 (or is it 51?) as something of a credibility booster.  Someone, it doesn't seem to be The Government itself, goes around and picks up super powered Artifacts that have potential for aiding World Evil, and locks them up in this, the 13th in a series of warehouses (the other 12 burned down, as we learn), where, one man, aided first by one, then two, young women, keeps them safe and locked up;  with two Secret Service agents co-opted to find, ""bag and tag"" artifacts still out there, and bring them in.

An Artifact can be anything.  Lewis Caroll's (""Alice In Wonderland"") mirror, with the apparently psychotic Alice trapped inside;  Edgar Allen Poe's pen, and diary.  Studio 54's disco ball (don't ask).  The premise could be as scary as a right wing nutjob's nightmares, where everything he contacts scares him, but instead such ideas come as more of annoyance.  The tag line for the show runs something to the effect of ""We take the things we don't know or understand and lock them up in a warehouse"".  Funny, but not so long ago, we would have brought in the scientists to find out what we don't know, and don't understand, which is how we got to the Moon, and built the Bomb.  And cured polio.  But now we're a society where the recent GOP convention made a big joke out of being a ""Fact Checker"", and even the government hating conspiratorialist conservatives didn'f find that alarming, so this is a show for the times.

In practice, the show runs as something of a Sci-Fi ""Castle"" with a handsome, young, unmarried,  odd-couple of sleuths, in this case Secret Service, dumped together, solving crimes that either involve an artifact; or trying to prevent someone from getting an artifact;  or often, in the beginning, going out and retrieving something that has the powers of an artifact, from someone who may not even know its significance.  Eventually, the story arc brings in an agent who's gone to the dark side, and things get a bit more interesting towards the end of Series 1.  Still, for my tastes, things resolve too neatly, too quickly, for this type of show.

In any case, when it's been revealed that the loons at the NSA are spying on everybody on the planet, clearly demonstrating that the Government in real life has gone wack-o, would we even want people running around locking up all these ""dangerous"" things in one central location, under one man's control?

Such questions will only ruin your pleasure in this show.  That's the real challenge of this series:  Watch But Don't Think.",1374624000,,3094,4.648897058823529

3901080,5,B002BWP2IK,"Has some of the weird and strange stuff of X-Files and Fringe, but with a more lighthearted and sometimes quite funny attitude, like Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

The series starts off with a couple Secret Service agents being re-assigned to a very top secret department called Warehouse 13, a repository for artifacts of great power: things like Excalibur, Icarus' wings, Poe's pen, Lewis Carrol's Looking Glass, Lizzie Borden's compact, possibly the Holy Grail, and thousands and thousands of other things that have been imbued with power. They also seek out new artifacts as they are created, to bring back to the Warehouse. This Warehouse is the thirteenth in human history; the first was built by Alexander the Great.

I think this is a simply wonderful show with cool ideas, some really good writing (concepts AND dialogue), and a cast that works really, really well together.",1373500800,,879,5.055172413793104

The plot lines are unique as they try to ""sna and bag"" the items from history before they can cause further problems.

There was one season, 3 or 4 I believe, when the plot lines fell off a little, but it has now regained its momentum. Give this show a tumble. I think you will thoroughly enjoy it.",1373155200,,473,4.314606741573034

3901134,5,B002BWP2IK,"This is a very entertaining series. A popcorn series if you will.

The pilot of this series is not that bad, but it didn't scream ""watch me!"" either.
However, if you stick to it, you'll find a series akin to the X-Files,
except that this team of investigators are knee deep into the paranormal stuff.

The character development it's intriguing and quite good; a good recipe to keep you watching.
And the acting is good as well. I initially confused the quirkiness of the characters with that of the actors,
but as the series develops, you begin appreciating the main actors a bit more.

Further episode continues the hunt of mysterious ""magical"" artifacts,
but haven't fall into exploiting the most common paranormal stuff so far into the first season.
Which speaks volumes of the writing in this series.

This is an aspect that is most satisfying as well. As you follows each episode,
you see a team of investigators following evidence in a logical manner.
An when they hit on a piece of evidence, it's one that you as an expectation could have
caught if you had paid attention.

I'm looking forward to furthers episodes",1371945600,,1121,4.728205128205128

However, I would like the series so much more, if presented as a dramatical genre, science fiction, as opposed to a comical  genre science fiction. For example, I am getting tired of the immature garble exchanged between the two main characters.... if the storyline was non-fictional, the characters would be ""more mature,"" and would be able to interact with each other 'professionally."" And, that is why ""Warehouse 13"" is ""okay."" And, I've had to ""take a break"" from watching the season...

3901178,4,B002BWP2IK,"If you want to kill a TV series, make it repeat the same plot, each episode.  Every series which only lasted a few seasons, died for this reason:  i.e., Star Trek died because it never really furthered any long-term plot, but was always an encounter with some alien issue, each time.

Ahhh, but Star Trek has a loyal cult following, you'll counter.  Right-e-o.  Why?  Because the cast and script were so perfectly balanced, you didn't CARE that the theme was mildly varied each time, whether Klingon or Ferengi or Q or (older Star Trek).. tribbles.  You didn't care that the set was obviously plastic or plaster;  the cheesy special effects, didn't matter;  didn't matter, that the makeup was obvious, the fight scenes faked.  For the cast and script, made you love it all anyway.  Same, for the Dr. Who series.

So Warehouse 13, similarly has great cast, good script (after the Pilot), wonderful ensemble chemistry.  And it's more realistic, with good special effects.  So you don't care how predictable, each episode.  In fact, the reason I started watching, was to see Saul Rubinek 'do his thing'.  I'd never seen the other actors, until this series.  Love them all.

I know the plot before it begins, just a question of which 'artifact' will do what to whom, and which way they solve it.  Psychic energy stored in some object, having to be balanced against other objects in a warehouse no one is supposed to know about -- far better idea than the popular Area 51 stuff.  Yet by itself, not important.

For here, it's how the actors do what they do, the lines, the HOW that matters more, than the story itself.  Is there a longterm plot?  I don't see one yet.  Nor do I care.",1370736000,,1678,4.610169491525424

The characters started off awkward and quirky, but quickly developed into stylish and funny. I find myself wanting to watch more, and have spent entire days watching episode after episode. You know you like a character when you look up the actors bio on-line to see what else they've done. I also like that the artifacts have authentic historical connections.

This show takes some well known and some not well known characters from Earth's history and their artifacts and creates fantastical crimes and problems for the agents of Warehouse 13 to solve. The characters in the show are not always believable (it is a SyFy show after all), but that adds to the unpredictability and thus entertainment of the show. The agents themselves come with quirks, hang-ups, and are evolving and changing over time (so there is more than just the obvious plots evolving.)

3901258,5,B002BWP2IK,"This slightly quirky SF series is a gem of intelligent writing. The characters have a depth and complexity well above the norm, and the plots are engaging. There's a good mix of drama and humour, and there is never a feel that the show is being 'written down' to some lowest common denominator.

Personally I would rate it as the best SF show since Torchwood, and one of the few that can stand comparison with classics like DS9 and Babylon 5.

The flavour is a bit like 'Torchwood meets Indiana Jones' - surprises and high tech with a dash of steampunk, and a sprinkling of fairy dust. While it can't be called pure 'hard' SF, very little can these days. The fantasy elements are kept in control, and given the initial presumptions, everything else is consistent and logical. In many ways, there is less gratuitous 'magic' than in Star Trek with its all-powerful holo-decks and infinitely mutable transporters and flux capacitors.

Equally refreshing, except sometimes for the annoyingly childish Pete, all the characters act intelligently, with motivation and reason. There are no plots kept in motion by dint of characters missing the obvious or indulging in scriptwriter-driven stupidity.

Even over the course of the first season, the characters grow and develop, and the tapestry of the tale is woven into a rich picture.

Highly recommended, especially for those who find other SF series too insubstantial or annoying.",1352332800,,1424,4.991561181434599

3901269,2,B002BWP2IK,"This is a Sci Fi show so it may end without any reason what so ever or it may have a confusing ending because Sci Fi might want to wrap it up quick.  I've been watching it and have been trying not to get invested in the characters for this reason.  Maybe if the show ends and has a real ending I'll buy it but basically I'm looking at this like another Sci Fi from people who can't spell SCi Fi.

A good show about some of the worlds greatest secrets are guarded by white people.  Like most shows on Sci Fi these days it sports a mostly white cast that heroically saves white people from supernatural creatures.  I don't want to spoil anything but I will say one thing.

I love science fiction, but the stuff on SciFi channel is usually far too hokey and unbelievable.  We discovered that the show is available on DVD, which opened the doors for us.

Due to the great selection of actors, and the wonderful personalities and situations written into the script, Warehouse 13 has quickly become an all-time favorite, along with its spinoff, Eureka.

If you like hairy happenings done with humor by a great cast and top-notch characterization, then Warehouse 13 is for you.  (And if you're lucky, you'll find out where Warehouse 2 was, 3,000 years ago . . .)  This show is like the proverbial book that you just can't put down.",1339632000,,759,4.704545454545454

Sound familiar? It should. Back in 1987 Fox ran a series called Friday the 13th in which a pair of cousins tack down cursed objects and return them to an antique shop that had belonged to their late uncle. The original show was original and downright spooky, and Warehouse 13 manages to be be as spooky as the original show with a good deal more humor. I discovered it while poking around the Sci-Fi shows on Netflix, and it's become a favorite of mine. Highly recommended for weekend late night viewing with friends.",1338681600,,708,4.764227642276423

The lead guy is annoying. Nothing else can describe him, he is childish, petty minded and annoying. The lead girl is better, but not much. The quality of script leaves a lot to be desired - some of the lines make the actors seem very poor, but they can't be as bad as they appear in some scenes - nobody would employ them if they were, so the script is pretty lame at times.

The characters are incredibly boring, one of the main characters basically acts like a poorly portrayed child, the others aren't too bad, just not that interesting.

The plot of the show itself could do a lot.. but it doesn't. Instead of unraveling a mystery behind the objects, it just shrugs it off and basically says who knows, who cares. And just about every famous person they can think of in history they just say it belonged to them, not adding this to overall the plot or anything. And the ""villain"" kind of has no real back story, just some guy that used to work there randomly screwing with them.

The show is about a couple people that seem to have no clue how to do their job nearly getting themselves killed every episode trying to place random objects in a vat of goo and store it in a warehouse.",1315180800,14,983,4.395604395604396

Unfortunately, it's saddled with two weak starring actors.  Pete is hard to see as the male lead.  Not too smart, or capable.  Myka has the classic female TV go-getter role, so no personality (though wait for Season 2).

However, Artie, Claudia and the artifacts themselves (usually) keep the show watchable.  Worth getting when on sale.",1310774400,4,481,4.864197530864198
3901304,4,B002BWP2IK,"It's taken two seasons on Sy-fy before I finally checked this show out properly. Actually, I checked out the pilot when it first aired but I didn't watch for long enough (which is to say I only watched the first hour of the two hour pilot) to get a proper feel for it. Or maybe I'm just really in the mood for science fiction involving a team that researches/stops strange things (Primeval, Torchwood, Doctor Who, Sanctuary, Fringe, etc). I didn't originally like it because the first hour felt derivative, but it turned out that the first hour was meant as more of a set up to show how main characters Myka and Pete of the secret service end up working in the middle of nowhere for Warehouse 13.

The plot: By-the-book Myka and child-at-heart Pete get sent to Warehouse 13, a secret government project responsible for detecting, subduing, and acquiring dangerous artifacts somehow imbued with a strong emotion/ability from its previous owner (a piece of driftwood from the Titanic freezes people, a personal makeup compact that made Lizzie Borden kill her parents, Lewis Caroll's Looking Glass...). Pete is suited to this job because he has a sort of sixth sense for danger and Myka has a photographic memory. They work with Artie who is in charge of the day to day running of the warehouse, Leena who gets vibes of people's auras (yeah, that one's a head scratcher but okay, if Pete has a sense for danger I'll go with this one too), and Claudia the teenage wiz kid who gets added to the group a few episodes into the series. They also have the occasional visits from Mrs. Frederic, a woman who seems to never age, can seemingly appear and disappear suddenly, and is the caretaker of the warehouse (giving her a special connection the building and providing her with a mental inventory of all the artifacts in the warehouse).

The show started a little weak, but quickly gets better as they build on the characters' pasts and the mythology surrounding the warehouse:

  The Characters- In truth, I find Myka and Pete's back stories to be the weakest on the show, perhaps because their issues are resolved so early on that it doesn't really play a role for that long in who they are. (Myka, for example, has a poor relationship with her father but finally forges a better relationship with him during the show.) It is only when they bring Claudia into the picture and establish her as a part of the team that the show really finds its voice. The reason for this, I think, is that Claudia changed the dynamic. They went from being co-workers to something closer to a family. Artie is the dad, Pete and Myka are the older siblings, Claudia is the kid sister everyone looks out for. Some people would put Leena as the mom, but I don't particularly care for her, she isn't much of a character at this point. This family dynamic is what makes the characters and by extension the show more loveable. We also delve into Artie's mysterious, different-named past, which is always exciting. He's sort of the guy working towards redemption because of past mistakes.
  The Mythology- here is where things get a little strange but interesting. There have been twelve previous incarnations of the warehouse that have been built in a new location for one reason or another. We have learned in the last two seasons that the warehouse is alive to some degree or another and forms some sort of neural link with its caretaker (in this case Mrs. Frederic). We also learn that they consider Claudia ""destined"" to become the next caretaker. What exactly the caretaker does is a little non-specific, besides mysterious appearances and having a lot of authority. How or why is unclear and though she seems uncertain, that's a step I would love to see the show take. It would give her a more definite and necessary role on the team (right now she and Artie sort of do the same thing). Another question is whether being the caretaker makes you vampire like in that you never age and you theoretically live forever unless you are specifically killed by something.

Overall, I think the show has gotten a lot stronger and I'm finding myself really enjoying it. Can't wait for it to come back though the show, having been renewed for a third season, has yet to have been given an actual return date. Can I be the only one who kind of hopes for some residual effects from the abandoned transference of caretaker power?",1308614400,,4389,4.661498708010336

The cast is wonderful and appropriately quirky and can pull off drama when needed. Too bad SYFY didn't keep The Dresden Files, it would have worked great with this and Eureka.

3901315,4,B002BWP2IK,"- Dr. Artie Nielsen to his new Agents: ""And that is exactly what we do here. Take the unexplained, and we just safely tuck it away in this super-sized Pandora's Box. Well, actually, Pandora's Box is over in aisle 989-B. Empty, of course.""

X-FILES rubbing up against INDIANA JONES is the tantalizing concept at the heart of WAREHOUSE 13, although, come to think of it, TNT's THE LIBRARIAN movies are even closer to theme. And to top it all off, the show's writers lob in an element of screwball. After saving the President's life at a fancy soire, two gifted Secret Service agents are reassigned indefinitely to the badlands of South Dakota, to the off-the-grid government storage facility called Warehouse 13. Except that Agents Pete Lattimer and Myka Bering are as incompatible as two partners can get. Lattimer is an intuitive maverick, but sort of all over the place. Agent Bering is strictly by-the-books and with a meticulous eye for detail, but she's highly irritable and uptight (although she does loosen up some as the season progresses). I guess they really are Mulder and Scully revisited. Or maybe David Addison and Maddie Hayes? Because there's a pervasive light tone to the series.

Both agents regard their reassignment as a sort of punishment, and on the surface you can see why. Stuck in one of the Dakotas, gazing at a fugly structure in the middle of nowhere, and with a weird, messy-looking person offering them cookies and a tour of the place. But inside the ridiculously vast Warehouse 13 is a whole new job description. Or as Mrs. Frederick, cryptic director of the Warehouse project, puts it, this new gig is ""an invitation to endless wonder."" Now Bering and Lattimer find themselves investigating paranormal occurrences and - for the world's peace of mind - confiscating dangerous mystic artifacts and storing them in the deep confines of Warehouse 13. ""Snag it, bag it, and tag it,"" as the show's motto goes. Long as they don't run out of that neutralizing purple solution.

There's such a neat factor involved around the artifacts: From the Tesla gun and the Farnsworth communication devices that the agents use to Edgar Allan Poe's pen which can bring its writer's words to life to Lewis Carroll's mirror which houses a vile spirit to Harriet Tubman's illusion-casting thimble. And because most of these knick-knacks are supernatural in nature, you don't get mired in scientific jibber-jabber. This show can pretty much come up with any wicked awesome relic it can think of. As a sports guy, maybe my favorite is the football which circles the planet when you throw it, eventually returning to the thrower like a boomerang.

The agents take their orders from Dr. Arthur ""Artie"" Nielsen, the secretive Agent-in-charge who acts as caretaker to Warehouse 13. Artie is fussy, and more than a little high strung, and a perennial crankypants. In other words, actor Sal Rubinek perfectly inhabits the role. Eddie McClintock and Joanne Kelly play the two squabbling Secret Service leads and they're instantly likable, very un-Rubinek-like. I love the barbed repartee between Pete and Myka. They exude that heat. It shouldn't be long before the fans are clamoring for them to pair up.

If I were to do one of those word association games and this show was mentioned, my immediate response would be ""helluva lotta fun."" WAREHOUSE 13 shares a similar thread with its sister series SANCTUARY, except that where SANCTUARY is mostly somber and moody, WAREHOUSE 13 is very much tongue-in-cheeked, and this in a way allows its audience to breathe. Pete and eventual newcomer, that cool genius teen Claudia Donovan, are unrepentant wiseacres and, as mentioned, even Myka loosens up some. And, occasionally, the episodes plonk the characters in humorous situations. Maybe my favorite episode of Season One - other than the ""Pilot"" - is the wild ""Breakdown"" episode, in which the Neutralizer Processing Center (which keeps the artifacts dormant) goes on the fritz, leaving Pete, Myka, and Claudia  trapped in a warehouse full of artifacts gone haywire. This is also when we meet the mysterious Regents, to whom Mrs. Frederick answers. ""Duped"" is a close second because it offers a different look at Myka. In ""Duped,"" Myka is caught at ground zero when the Studio 54 disco ball (which unleashes trapped desires) and Lewis Carroll's mirror clash. This episode also features Erica Cerra and Niall Matter (both from EUREKA, but playing different characters).

Other noteworthy episodes: ""Resonance,"" if you're a fan of Tricia Helfer who here plays a sexy FBI agent. ""Burnout"" expands the Warehouse 13 mythology as Myka and Pete find the skeleton of a Warehouse 13 agent in the basement of a police precinct. Don't get it twisted, though, there have been bits of world-building and the establishing of thru arcs from jump. The weird ""haunting"" of Warehouse 13 in the early episodes would lead to Claudia Donovan's arrival. We learn of Artie's shady past, and its present-day ramifications. We peek into the Dark Vault, in which the most dangerous artifacts are safeguarded. And in the last arc, the agents come face to face with the greatest threat to Warehouse 13, one of its former agents James MacPherson. This guy is a nasty customer and has a beef with Artie. He also has a knack for consistently staying several steps ahead of Artie and the agents. MacPherson's machinations leave us all hanging in Season One's taut final episode. To be honest, I loved the pilot and but wasn't so into the next four or five episodes (not counting ""Claudia,"" which is pretty good). But with ""Burnout,"" things pick up and the show begins building momentum all the way to the season ender. If you're not watching this show, I say you're missing out on something good. If it's an incentive, Season 2 even features a crossover with the excellent EUREKA.

WAREHOUSE 13 - SEASON ONE presents all twelve episodes on three discs and features the following bonus stuff: cast & crew commentaries on 4 episodes (the ""Pilot"" episode with actor Saul Rubinek; ""Claudia"" with actors Joanne Kelly, CCH Pounder, Allison Scagliotti, & producers Jack Kenny and Drew Z.

Artie, is the perfect leader for this crew,  Mrs. Fredricks, gets even more complicated with every episode.  Pete, and Myka, they are a whole show on they're own. Though, I don't agree that Pete is total screw-up, as a few reviewers have mentioned, although, to me his character is still developing.  His cookie fetish, and his somewhat childish sayings are just part of himself that he is protecting himself from others.

Visually, it's very appealing:  attractive cast, fascinating sets, interesting premise, good special effects.  How frustrating that the plots were so BORING and the characters so 2-dimensional.  Why is it, even now in the 21st century, that script writers still think a ""strong' woman is one who has little sense of humor, is aggressively in-your-face with men while at the same time dressing like date bait, and is secretly longing to put a relationship in front of a brilliant career?  The women are offensive stereotypes--but so are the men.  The male lead is such a typical Peter Pan whose tongue hangs out when he sees an attractive woman, is condescending, patronizing (""I should take point--I should be the team leader!), and predictable.  Who needs to watch another narcissistic male act out his fantasies?  The plots are dull and the conclusions are pathetic.

You had me in the first ten minutes when Secret Service Agents Pete Lattimer (Eddie McClintock)and Myka Ophelia Bering (Joanne Kelly) were bickering like competing siblings. Dr. Arthur ""Artie"" Nielsen (Saul Rubenik) is their caring but grouchy boss. I could watch Rubinik read a phone book. He is the best character actor I have ever seen. And speaking of character actors here are some that bring the fun and quirky to the show:

* Genelle Williams as Leena is the innkeeper and helps in the warehouse.

* Allison Scagliotti as Claudia Donovan is the baby sister agent of the group, and watched over by Artie and Mrs. Frederic.

* C. C. H. Pounder as Mrs. Irene Frederic - Warehouse13's keeper (emotionally and physically) and who hilariously appears and disappears when you least expect it.

The show revolves around a Raiders of the Lost Ark type government warehouse that has a team of agents bag and tag history's famous artifacts that cause death and devastation when they are in the wrong hands. Emotions (or sometimes plain greed or even stupidity) cause awful things to happen and Myka and Pete are sent to investigate and retrieve the items without causing further damage to anyone or anything.

The series starts out with the usual two leads attracted to each other but arguing and that has wisely been less a feature of season 2. They don't need that tension and the characters are better off as friends.  But here this series begins it journey and it has a few uneven moments but overall it's just alot of fun.  The dvd set looks great and is worth adding to your collection.  Sure this series has influences from past sci fi shows however this one also is a bit on the mystical side because many artifacts they hunt have 'powers'.  Saul rubinek really adds alot of presence to the whole affair too.  This show just keeps getting better and they do need to make more than just 13 eps a season. They have four lead characters to provide stories for and 20 eps could easily provide them with more adventures.  I think the overall emphasis here is on entertainment and who cares what it's comparible too? I don't , I just enjoy this show. Just like I enjoy the great 'being human' on bbc america.
(that's a plug) but wharehouse 13 leaves me with a smile every episode and it's not a dark show like battlestar gallactica ( loved both versions!) but I don't watch this for darkness, it's got humour and fun galore and likeable leads so it's well worth your time.

3901348,2,B002BWP2IK,"I gave this series a chance because the idea was dreamed up by Jane Espenson, who wrote so many wonderful scripts for Buffy. After seeing the finished product, I assume she simply passed on the idea and left the development to others - because this has none of the wit, charm and style I associate with her writing.

First problem: the characters with the most screen time are annoying in the extreme. It seems that every series must now have a man and woman who perpetually snark at each other, with underlying sexual tension, in the hopes of keeping viewers hanging in for the moment when they tear each other's clothing off - after which said viewers will all go away, never to watch again. This is surely the most tired trope in existence. It was great when it was Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell in My Girl Friday, but that was really because the actors and the script were legendary. Now it's just sad that writers believe that every show must have two characters who argue constantly. In this case, it's particularly annoying since the sniping is not witty, and feels so very contrived. Must every show be for adolescents or, worse, 40 year old adolescents?

Second problem: Clumsy exposition, in which the woman agent must explain to the man agent every reference that goes back more than two weeks since, apparently, he never had no schoolin' and don't know nothin' about nothin'. Ok, he's dim. Why should we be subjected to ongoing attempts to educate someone who has managed to reach maturity without knowing much more than my four year old niece? I frequently find myself cringing with embarrassment while watching these characters - not a feeling I enjoy overly much. Cultivated stupidity really is not appealing.

Third problem: Weak stories that are poorly written, flat and predictable, with no real story arc and no discernible ideas. The predictability alone isn't enough to sink them, but the fact that there's no intrinsic interest to be found in the ""magical"" objects, or the utterly forgettable characters, or the plot, leaves little to hope for.

Having said this, there's Saul Rubinek, who is a delightful actor and always worth watching. I don't believe he can carry this show by himself, however, since the other two main characters have so much screen time in which to act stupid and make faces at each other. Have I mentioned they both have the most annoying facial mannerisms? Someone may think their grimacing endearing (to each his own) but I think it's idiotic and there's a limit to how much of that kind of thing I can tolerate.

There's one more thing that might incline people to give this show a chance: the wonderful steampunk look of the devices that have been built (obviously very lovingly) for the agents' use both in and outside the Warehouse. They're delightful but, again, not likely to be enough to keep viewers tuned in.

I'm not one of those people who give a new show only one chance to hook me. I don't think that's fair. But this show has a lot going against it, most particularly the boring scripts that are devoid of ideas, and the infantile main characters and their strange facial antics, so it's unlikely that I'll be tuned in much beyond the first season.",1280102400,42,3212,4.726785714285715

3901355,3,B002BWP2IK,"In ""Warehouse 13,"" an off-the-grid arm of the U.S. Government tracks down historical artifacts that are best left untouched by human hands.  Examples of such items are books, mirrors, swords and chairs, some of which were possessed by famous figures from history.  Once the artifacts are retrieved, they are returned to Warehouse 13, a massive repository located in the remote American midwest.

While the show is generally well written and presented, it lacks the must-see pull of shows such as ""Battlestar Galactica"" and ""Lost,"" falling more into the ""Sanctuary"" category, where special effects tend to dominate a decent story that might otherwise lack a pervasive story arc.  Translate that as: Usually, the two main characters track down an item, stick it on a shelf at the end of the show and end with some amusing banter.

The aforementioned story arc (or, perhaps, series arc) revolves around the man, Artie, played by Saul Rubinek, who operates the warehouse.  His mysterious background as a former warehouse agent is touched upon in several episodes, along with details about his partner's betrayal and the group behind warehouse operations.  While this arc IS present in the first season, it suffers from a lack of mystery or surprise.  When you find out about something, you might say to yourself, ""Okay.  That's that.""  On ""BSG"" and ""Lost"" there's more of a WOW factor as information is revealed.

Unfortunately, the show sucked.  Three basic reasons:
- It was predictable. The ""twists"" were pretty poorly done. I found myself telling my wife what was going to happen about halfway through the show.
- The main characters sucked. The childish yet charming rulebreaker with the heart of gold (like a C grade Richard Castle with no money and a vague footballer mentality) teamed up with the irritating rule follower with the heart of gold (the overachieving career-first woman character from way too many shows). Oh, and the romance angle was trite in the extreme.
- The show couldn't decide who it was aimed at.  The main characters acted like children, which is fine when the show is for kids, but grating when its for adults.

There were some OK special effects occasionally, but thats par for the course these days. That said, many of the effects were awful (including the long shots of the inside of the Warehouse - you'd think they would have tried hard to get that right).

I loved the movie trilogy and felt the heavens were really smiling on me by giving me a tv show to continue their tradition.
I'm just pointing all this out to show how I was so perfectly positioned to fall in love with Warehouse 13.

Sadly, all that promise came to nothing!
For the reviewer who said the leads did not inspire rooting...I rooted for them anyway. I actually began to grudgingly give a fig about the main characters. This did not extend to the later-introduced psycho-stalker-techie nerd-cool-young/hip-ANNOYING-Claudia.

I gave the show every opportunity to rise above its swirling cloud of mediocrity. I reminded myself that even Eureka (especially&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eureka-Season-3-5/dp/B0032JTUX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eureka: Season 3.5</a>) had downright dreary, who-cares days. I waited patiently for someone to write an actual cohesive series of events to replace what appeared to be random wandering through half-developed ideas and story lines. I valiantly watched the entire season, stifling the urge to reach into the screen and tidy up the rather confused warehouse (which was also physically untidy).
It actually felt like the show was meant to be a one-off mini-series, or something, and everyone - actors and writers - went through each episode as though it would be canceled at any moment.

Sadly, at the end of season 1, I felt as drained of goodwill as I had been with the ill-fated relaunched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bionic-Woman-Volume-One/dp/B0012IXBNC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bionic Woman - Volume One</a>. (I actually heaved a sigh of relief when that one was canceled as it freed me from what I felt was my duty to support anything to do with the classic show in particular, and science fiction in general.)

Again, sadly, I would probably feel the same relief if Warehouse 13 were canceled, because I DID watch it to the bitter end, lest I miss out on THE MOMENT...you know, the one on which Simon Cowell continually  harps.
WH13 should at least get a MAJOR overhaul before returning.
It's such a GREAT concept....how did it manage to not achieve its potential?

Before voting on my review, please note that I WANTED it to succeed... I still do. Watch the TNT-Made Librarian Movies, and you'll have an idea what I was expecting it to live up to, or even surpass. And there's nothing wrong in calling for growth, especially in a new series. (My attempt to not get completed voted down, but oh well....)

I firmly believe that there are more than even 13 great episodes wandering around somewhere in that disheveled warehouse, trying to find a map. Or a broom. Or a writer to think at least 5 episodes ahead.
I just hate that I am dreading its return...'cause you know I'll be watching every episode regardless of my review.

3901359,4,B002BWP2IK,"Combine ""The X-Files"" with Indiana Jones and add a dash of ""Sanctuary,"" and voila -- you have ""Warehouse 13.""

Yeah, Sci-fi/SyFy's latest series isn't exactly the most original or unique show out there, but it is strangely endearing. After a round of rather generic standalone episodes, this series bounces off once it introduces a main villain and a plot arc -- and while there's little romantic chemistry, the lead characters are a likable bunch with some nicely handled character development.

After a weird incident involving an assassin and an Aztec bloodstone, Secret Service agents Myka Bering (Joanne Kelly) and Pete Lattimer (Eddie McClintock) are summoned to a run-down warehouse in the South Dakota badlands. An eccentric agent called Artie (Saul Rubinek) informs them that this is Warehouse 13, which holds dangerous and bizarre ""artifacts"" -- and their new assignment is to collect and neutralize new artifacts.

Among the problems they encounter: a young man possessed by a strange Italian power, bank robberies using music, a teleportation experiment gone wrong, a device that channels enough energy to fry people to a crisp, a katana that can slice through light, a mirror that switches Myka with a malevolent creature, and a prison whose occupants are driven to madness by the ghosts of their pasts. But the most dangerous problem is a former agent of the Warehouse, who is now determined to grab the artifacts for his own purposes -- and destroy Artie and the others as well.

Despite being pretty derivative of ""The X-Files"" at times (skeptical strict female agent paired with quirky wild card), ""Warehouse 13"" has a pretty brilliant concept -- basically it's about a place that seals away any dangerous historical artifacts. Among the artifacts: Poe's pen, Lewis Carroll's mirror, a Studio 54 disco ball (which plays ""I Will Survive"" when disturbed) the Tesla gun, a giant steampunky computer and a wishing kettle that produces ferrets.

The stories are a solid blend of action, grimy sci-fi (the warehouse is a pretty bleak-looking place), and a bit of comedy on the side (one of the Important Artifact-Seeking Questions is, ""Do you smell fudge?""). While the first few episodes are rather generic one-offs, the plots become tighter and more intense about halfway through -- and the addition of the sociopathic MacPherson and the Regents adds a new level of potential to the arc storyline.

Downsides? The dialogue can be painfully cool-kiddish at times, especially when Claudia is being annoyingly self-referential (""Couldn't any genius whiz-kid?""). And the romantic chemistry between Kelly and McClintock is almost nil.

But Kelly and McClintock make a solid supernatural-detective duo -- he's a quirky pop-culture-loving weirdo (although I just can't see him as a Secret Service agent) with a weakness for cookies, while her almost-fanatical devotion to rules/plans is explained by a tragic personal loss. Allison Scagliotti does a good job as the erratic ""whiz-kid,"" although her character can be annoying. But Saul Rubinek is the ruling force in this series -- a quirky, gruff, antisocial man who is haunted by the many agents lost in pursuit of artifacts. He's absolutely brilliant.

""Warehouse 13 Season 1"" is pretty derivative at times, but it's also strangely endearing and quite fun. The best part is, it seems to be getting better with time.",1267660800,116,3372,5.185661764705882
3901360,3,B002BWP2IK,"I will not cover so much on individual plots. Basically, it's a nice show to watch to pass time. Fans of X-files can watch it to re-live the guy-lady agent partnership investigating paranormal occurrence. This time round, they are working under the cover of the Secret Service agents. What they are hunting are not aliens but artifacts own by people triggering the occurrence.

All the artifacts are kept in a magnetic ziplog bag to be de-sanitised (the ghostbuster part) and ultimately store in the warehouse. Watching this show, one can't help feeling that the writers are trying hard to re-live through the old memories of past achievements by great Americans. Of course it's a little peppered with other artifacts from other cultures and nations. But somehow, their fates are intimately tied to the United States. So its like a nostalgic ride of history.

On another positive note, it does raise the hopes to viewers that you may have one day specialized on something and become someone great. For that matter, some intimate items you possess may capture your energy and aspiration, becoming an artifact with special powers for potential Warehouse 13 storage.

Overall, I give it a 3 stars for being a entertaining nice show. In terms of originality for paranormal, I think the X-Files still tops.",1266192000,3,1301,4.986175115207374
3901361,5,B002BWP2IK,"I originally was interested in this series because I had heard that Rockne O'Bannon (Farscape and various other scifi shows) was connected with it and that Joanne Kelly ""Myka Bering"" was in it.  I was not disappointed.  Sure it's not as deep and dark as Farscape got, but you know what, after watching Farscape (and I LOVE Farscape) I was ready for a fun, lighthearted, let's watch this little family grow up together show.  WH13 does this.  I love the banter between Pete & Myka and Artie & Claudia. They all work so well together that it is a joy to watch.

I've re-watched most of the eps several times over since the show started and even after it finished it's first season run on SyFy.  That's how much I love this show.

If you're looking for Friday the 13th, X Files, or any other show WH13 has been compared to you'll be disappointed because while it may have similarities to those shows, WH13 IS NOT those shows. Yes the Warehouse is very similar to the one at the end of Indiana Jones and I think this might be one of the many things I LOVE about it.

It's fun, quirky and very enjoyable to watch.  I can not WAIT for the DVDs.  HOWEVER, if they do not include the music from eps 8 ""Duped"" on the DVDs I may not buy them because that music makes an awesome eps even more awesome!",1261353600,13,1290,4.271604938271605

3901363,2,B002BWP2IK,"I agree with a previous review... I can't make myself watch more than 3 episodes. The female lead is grating & anxiety ridden. Her waify looks, & bee stung lips also contribute to an unbelieveable & annoying character!

The other main characters are somewhat amusing. But this show falls way short of Brit TV's 5 STAR shows such as Sancuary & Torchwood. For whit, humor, fab plots, suspense, & sexiness check out those shows instead.",1255651200,,433,4.773333333333333

There is a caretaker and a male and female agent who go out to retrieve new items.
The characters have excellent chemistry right from the start and a lot of fun and some seriousness ensues.
The items themselves and their properties ,when mixed with the characters,makes the show really special and sometimes hilarious.
A conspiracy arc develops involving another character or 2  later in the season.

3901369,2,B002BWP2IK,"It is very hard to resist being sarcastic when reviewing this pilot of Warehouse 13. My guess is that the writer(s) hope that we will be so drawn in by the actors that we won't notice the obvious flaws in the basic premise.  That approach definitely works if the actors are likable enough. So the BIG question is, do these actors have what it takes.  I found the host at the warehouse 13 guesthouse to be very interesting. I would enjoy seeing her character expanded.  She seems to know a lot more then she says.  She also seems a little bit of a tease...  The lead male actor seems to be going for the ""Jack"" from Stargate image.  Dumb, intuitive, kind, and adventurous.  That approach can work as long as he appears sincere and well intentioned.  So far it is kind of iffy if he is the type of guy we would really want to be with on a team.  The lead woman actor seems to be going for the ""anal retentive"", well read,  ""poor little misunderstood childhood"" image.  That approach can work as long as long as she has some redeeming characteristic that makes us want/need her on the team.  So far she seems totally replaceable.  The warehouse manager's character makes very little sense at this point.  However his character is based on the premise that we buy into the whole warehouse 13 concept.  You have to be able to believe that the US government is so stupid that it would tuck away objects of proven earth shaking scientific value in a warehouse without a vast number of scientists studying them.  The reader might say: The ""stargate"" was locked away in a warehouse for year and we seemed to buy into that.  Ah, but we were given a loophole on that.  We don't get to see the ""stargate"" stored away for years untouched with no one studying it after its power was seen.  Once the purpose of the ""stargate"" was determined it was locked away because it was ""too dangerous to be used""...  Maybe the writers could use the ""too dangerous to study"" approach for warehouse 13...  Bottom line: they need to do something to make the premise more believable.  Or, they could go the other way and make the show an obvious joke.  However, that is kind of risky because then it would only appeal to the slapstick audience.",1247961600,4,2214,4.466334164588528

3901374,2,B002BWP2IK,"First, let me say that I like Joanne Kelly.  I first noticed her in the ""Dresden Files"" as Bianca, the vampire-ess(?).  I think if we had a little more Bianca, Dresden would have hung around much longer.  But in ""Warehouse 13"" she doesn't seem to be very believable as this action-oriented agent ala Olivia Dunham in ""Fringe"".  The character, Myka Bering (as in over-bearing??), comes off as way too controlling to the point where she ends up being just plain irritating.  Not good to have the main character be irritating.

Playing her trusty side-kick, Eddie McClintock does indeed work better as Pete (keep your sunny side up) Lattimer.  Saul Rubineck comes over the best as the outwardly quirky curator, Artie Nielson.  You get the feeling that he really understands that the world and the things in it can be quite different than they seem.

Maybe the problem here is that it honestly does come too close to ""Fringe"" to dismiss the similarities and I cannot avoid a comparison.  Frankly, I think the casting of Joanne Kelly was a mistake--possibly a fatal one.  Where ""Fringe"" challenges the viewer on multiple levels, ""Warehouse 13"" seems to be a fairly weak knockoff of several shows--""Kolchak--the Night Stalker"" being somewhere in that mix.  Anna Torv is totally believable as FBI agent Olivia Dunham, while Joanne...well.  The same great casting can be said for the rest of ""Fringe"" cast, while Werehouse 13 simply doesn't compare.  (Well, maybe Artie--he'd be neat in a ""Fringe"" episode.)

While I'll concede that there's so much exposition that has to be done in a pilot, all you have to do is to compare the pilot of ""Fringe"" and maybe Kolchak or, for that matter, the X-Files to see how better series approach the problem.  For me, I'll Tivo this thing (won't buy it).  Now that Myka considers this assignment up to her standards of importance, maybe Kelly can inject something that makes her character a little more palatable.",1247529600,5,1941,4.8689024390243905
3901375,5,B002BWP2IK,"Ok.. It took me awhile to realise that SyFy was SciFi. I keep wanting to rewrite it... SyFi? :-)

Anyhow.. I really enjoyed this pilot. I caught it on USA and thoguht it was a new series. I noticed it was 3 hours and commercials weren't rolling regularly... That's when I decided it was a show of some kind... I searched cable for the next one and found nothing... so I went to the computer and kept seeing that Warehouse 13 was a new SyFy show.

I was confused.

I wondered if SyFy was a new USA name for a certain hour of TV. After a bit of searching (And visiting SyFy's website)... I realised that it was a new show. An awesome show.. that I'm looking forward to viewing regularly.

ABOUT THE SHOW:

- It reminds me slighty of XFiles... A little bit of Ghost Busters... and a little bit of your typical detective show.

-In the pilot.. the two detectives were just starting to warm up to the idea of working with eachother. They would find strange supernatural objects and neutralize them (this is the only ghostbuster aspect).

- I liked the references to past masterminds .. and the technologies supposedly created that were now being stored in the warehouse.

- The direcor created a great world to explore.  I think there are an endless number of possibilities. (I was a little disappointed that all of the technologies weren't futuristic.... Actually.. some of them were down right dated).

- I liked the mystery behind all of the mind reading....

Apparently it's free on amazon :-) ... So you should check it out!",1247270400,2,1524,4.525547445255475
