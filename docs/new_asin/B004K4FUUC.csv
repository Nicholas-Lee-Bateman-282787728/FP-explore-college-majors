4392751,5,B004K4FUUC,"Lark Rise to Candleford is a charming BBC period drama that tackles myriad themes, and is adapted from Flora Thompson's semi-autobiographical novel. In the first season, young Laura Timmins (Olivia Hallinan) leaves her village of Lark Rise to work as an assistant to the postmistress in Candleford, Dorcas Lane ( a brilliant Julia Sawalha who first impressed me as Lydia Bennet in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pride-and-Prejudice-Restored-Edition/dp/B00364K6YW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pride and Prejudice (Restored Edition)</a>). Through the course of the first season, Laura discovers that she enjoys living in the more affluent town of Candleford, and experiences the pangs of adolescence, including romantic entanglements. Dorcas Lane, the kind-hearted and sensible postmistress also goes through some pangs of her own, largely to do with her friendship with squire, Sir Timothy Midwinter (Ben Miles) who is married to the beautiful and composed Lady Adelaide (Olivia Grant). In the first season, viewers got to see the themes of marital strife, conflicts between the upper and lower classes, romantic entanglements, and other issues played out.

By the second season, both Sir Timothy and Lady Adelaide have moved to London, but there is still plenty of drama in Dorcas' life with the arrival of James Dowland (Jason Merrells), a former inhabitant of Lark Rise, a local boy who has done well in life. A young clockmaker, Fisher Bloom (Matthew McNulty) comes to town, and Laura finds herself attracted to Fisher, though he seems oblivious to her charms, initially. Laura's parents, Robert and Emma Timmins (Brendan Coyle & Claudie Blakley) who have always been a very close and loving couple find themselves facing some marital strife in their marriage, and this second season takes an intimate look at their dynamics as a couple.

Season Three sees the introduction of a significant new character, Daniel Parrish (played by Ben Aldridge), a young journalist who arrives in Lark Rise with some life-altering news for the Timmins. The independent and strong-willed Dorcas Lane continues as Candleford's postmistress, and experiences some human drama of her own, taking on a role that she finds fulfills her immensely. Unlike previous seasons, Dorcas' story is no longer the only dominant thread this season, as other characters begin to get more screen time, such as postman Thomas Brown (Mark Heap) and his devoted wife Margaret Ellison (Sandy McDade); Minnie the maid (clumsy and awkward yet so innocent and plain speaking); the wise and at times clairvoyant Queenie Turrill (Linda Bassett) and her simpleton husband Twister; young Alf Arless (John Dagliesh), the Pratt sisters, Ruby and Pearl (Victoria Hamilton and Matilda Zeigler), and others.

In the final season i.e. Season Four, viewers only get to watch six episodes. There is also a significant absence in the form of actor Brendan Coyle (who played Robert Timmins). In the story, Robert's character is portrayed as having gone off to work elsewhere to send money home to his family (in actual fact, actor Brendan Coyle had landed a meaty role in the period drama&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masterpiece-Classic-Downton-Abbey-Original-UK-Unedited-Edition/dp/B0047H7QD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey  (Original UK Unedited Edition)</a>). The first episode sees the introduction of a new character Gabriel Cochrane (Richard Harrington)who has lost his once flourishing foundry business to the bank and who is also recently widowed. Luckily for Gabriel, Dorcas offers him a job and a home and the people of Candleford welcome him into their fold. Gabriel however is intent on reclaiming his former position and vows to get back at the people who have cost him his livelihood. Emma Timmins finds herself at wits' end when the money sent by her husband Robert is lost by her son Edmund. In the second episode, Daniel Parrish who runs the local paper, organizes a poetry writing competition and Laura gets upset when there is insinuation of favoritism toward her (since Daniel and Laura are courting). In the third episode, Thomas the postman is ecstatic when he is put in charge of the church bazaar but clashes with the new reverend, forward thinking curate Reverend Marley. The reverend's relationship with Emma Timmins also gives rise to gossip. In the fourth episode, Alf and Minnie's love is tested when Alf wins the title King of the Fair and Queenie finds herself upset at Twister when he does something behind her back, involving a pig Queenie won. Episode Five revolves around a cricket match where Daniel is intent on victory against a neighboring town. Only problem is that Daniel's fledgling team lacks superior players, until he finds an unexpected star player. The final episode sees Gabriel working on an invention that may restore his wealth and standing, and it also focuses on the developing attraction between Gabriel and Dorcas. But are these two strong-willed and fiercely independent souls too independent-minded for their own good?

Frankly, I was rather underwhelmed by this final season. The actors did an amazing job in their roles, yet the stories just appeared to lack the extra 'something' that made the previous three seasons so special and incredibly addictive. None of the episodes in this season (well, except for the final episode perhaps) seemed to engage me as deeply as some of the episodes in the previous seasons - Dorcas' torment regarding her relationship with Sir Timothy Midwinter and the impact on Sir Timothy's wife (one of my favorite episodes was the one where Sir Tim's wife finds the abandoned girl and insists on raising her as their own given their childlessness, and then goes berserk when she finds Dorcas and Timothy have been sort of 'plotting' behind her back); the exploration of Emma and Robert Timmins' marriage and the episode where Emma tries to assert some independence and find her own 'voice'; the romance between Thomas and Ms. Ellison (their courtship is so comical yet sweet); the episode where both Candleford and Lark Rise come together to help with the harvest and the way the two communities deal with tragedy, and many more. I also did not care much for the character Gabriel Cochrane and felt the chemistry between Dorcas and Gabriel lacked credibility.

Despite the flaws in this season's episodes, I still gave it five stars if only because the acting was top-notch and the cinematography was spectacular as always. I will miss this series dearly and can only hope that the BBC will bring the cast back for at least a TV movie and tie up the loose ends - it would be a nice treat for the fans of LRTC.",1298332800,103,6762,5.320860617399439
4392752,5,B004K4FUUC,"English country life could never have been as poetic, pictorial, and enchanting as this dramatization of the lives of those living in and around the two 1880's towns of Lark Rise and Candleford. Even the DVD's music puts a sanguine sugarcoating on the period. All of this is to the delight of the viewer of this masterfully done TV series sure to endear any North American who has a tender video heart toward Victorian Britain. Perhaps, consider it a British mutation of ""Little House on the Prairie"" or ""The Waltons."" A more earthy twist to ""Upstairs Downstairs,"" another Brit historical period series not to be missed.

This set has 6 episodes of the commoner Lark Rise village and the more sophisticated Candleford. The short 8-mile separation allows for much intermingling, bigotry, conflict, forbidden love, political and economic interaction. It is not a family saga, not a nobility bloodline dramatization, but a saga of struggles and lifestyles of different kinds of personalities, each caught in their own born-into world, and interacting with another different, and not always understood, class of folk.

Darling Laura Timmins (Olivia Hallinan), Lark Rise born, was sent to Candleford to learn the trade of postmistress. She is the spark caught between the two towns (sometimes world's different.) Her mentor is Dorcas (Julia Sawalha.) Plenty of past characters returning to make it a continuation in cast and story from the previous season.
 The cast is an assortment of either the die-hard, disheveled, working class or the Candleford higher class, shy of nobility range. Cast individuals make this memorable.

One episode travels into the next with carryover from earlier material. If you have the time, watch all 6 back to back. TV viewers must have waited impatiently for the next installment. Episodes has multiple plots so it is hard to break down the 6 episodes into short summaries. And with carryover from one episode to another, it's more like moving to Lark Rise or Candleford and living with the good people (and the bad). A delightful scenic experience even Disney has never matched.

Ah, Queenie (Linda Bassett), an old bee keeper, a favorite of mine, will make you laugh and cry, perhaps in the same scene. She can only be upstaged by her hubby, Twister (Karl Johnson.) Love that pair. Ruby (Victoria Hamilton) is back without her man, oops. Thomas (Mark Heap) is a postal delivery man who yet helps keep Christianity alive and aloud. Laura's ma, Emma (Claudie Blakley) is here, but pa, Robert is off working elsewhere. Well, the list could go on.

Locations and sets to dream of as a vacation spot. Costumes to dazzle, delight, and disgust, depending upon the event. Every emotion you have ever felt in your past will be repeated sometime throughout this English town saga. The adapted books by Flora Thompson have never been read by this reviewer, but I can't imagine them being as fine as this TV series (and I'm a book lover). A superb British cast has perfected this story.

Subtitles? Yes!
Downside? Only 6 episodes, you'll want more.
Recommendation? BUY NOW! It's that good.
If you have not seen Series 1, 2, & 3, get those first. Watch them in order. It's worth every wee farthing.",1297987200,99,3215,4.953617810760668
4392753,5,B004K4FUUC,"Lark Rise to Candleford is in season 4 and having viewed  the first 3 seasons at least twice I think it is one of best. . From script to acting.this show excels at presenting a  ""slice of life"" of normal folk. The main story line is the interaction between the people in the poor hamlet of LarkRise and the well to do more progressive residents of neighboring Candleford. The post office is a main background as is the local Wagons and Horses Pub of the hamlet folk. Julia Sawalha ( BBC Pride and Prejudice's Lydia) is the postmistress has so much charm it is ""her one weakness"" .The cast is not lacking in talent or appeal.",1297555200,32,624,4.370689655172414

4392795,1,B004K4FUUC,I was unhappy to discover that the DVD was not compatible with the player my mother had.  This was a gift for my mother and she was not able to play it.

4392802,5,B004K4FUUC,"This is more than two neighboring towns competing. Yes, there is conflict and personalities that clash, but there is also a deep searching for truth and for intimacy and for the honesty deep within a persons' soul. This series fleshes out most of the characters over the many seasons until you feel close to each one. They become friends and family with all the warts one would expect.",1515888000,,385,4.676470588235294

4392813,5,B004K4FUUC,"Well worth your time! But beware... you will want to binge on this series! It is hard to say, ""Just one episode tonight!"" And it is well worth seeing the second time! A wholesome series for folk who are tired of the BBC pushing the edge all the time with profanity and sex. Instead there is love without sex and laughter without raunch.",1515715200,,336,4.349206349206349
4392814,5,B004K4FUUC,"We've rewatched this series several times over the years, and love it equally each time.  I give the series 5 stars, but shame on BBC for ending the series so abruptly in its fourth season.  This is the one time I can say - I enjoy the series more than the book which inspired it!

4392820,5,B004K4FUUC,"Loved the series and couldn't wait to watch each episode.  I watch all four seasons (3-1/2 really!) back-to-back over the course of 3-1/2 weeks.  Characters were perfection.  The last season was rushed compared to every other season, so it seemed to end awkwardly.  Still highly recommend it.",1509926400,,292,5.148936170212766

4392823,4,B004K4FUUC,"This rating is for all 4 seasons.  Overall, the show is great for everyone in the family.  It's entirely innocent, full of good morals, humanity, social awareness, kindness and love.  It has moments of real humor that made me laugh out loud.  The only reason I took a star was one season where Christians were genuinely mocked while pagan beliefs were held up as the 'correct' way of worshipping.  The church and those in it were held up as ignorant, shallow, uptight, ineffectual and lacking in human kindness while pagan beliefs were shown to be lovely, humane, magical, effective and above all, the most moral thing people could do.  The message got very preachy in one season to the point of discomfort.  I almost stopped watching, but I'm glad I didn't.  The show corrected itself and the insults toward Christianity ended.  The finer points of the show endured to the end. All in all, this show greatly entertained me for four seasons.  One of the finest shows the BBC (or anyone) has ever made!",1508976000,3,1001,4.7011494252873565

4392827,5,B004K4FUUC,"Lark Rise to Candleford is a story of great wisdom and heart. One of the best if not the best series based on a book that I have ever watched. Excellent in every way: acting, script, scenery, sets. I loved it and will watch again.",1507507200,,230,4.133333333333334
4392828,3,B004K4FUUC,"I loved the first season.  It was everything it was supposed to be.  From season 2 forward, it was clear that agenda driven writers got hold of it.  It became preachy and totally against the demographic that the original series was meant to address.  We started to see the ""evolution"" of the women's movement, the feminization of men, removing strong men from the cast, anti-religious themes (making fun of people of faith with comical depictions of believers), etc.

They couldn't figure out why they lost their audience?  That's why.",1507075200,5,535,4.955056179775281

Since watching Season One, I have come home from work nearly every afternoon and joined the people of Lark Rise and Candleford, and watched them tackle life's difficulties together.  During its four seasons, I was able to leave the realities of my stressful, complicated life and relax at the edge of a golden wheat field.  I am disappointed that there were only four seasons and will miss the charming characters...especially Queenie and Dorcas. They made me forget that there was unkindness in the world.",1506038400,,563,5.043010752688172

It's rare these days to find a tv show that teaches so many valuable life lessons. The characters are all so different, but you come to appreciate the uniqueness of each one.

Laura was barely present in the last episode, and Robert was not in Season 4 because he was starting on Downton Abbey. Just a couple of things I noticed including a loop hole or two with the Arlesses. But I loved this series. I'm a fan of Brendan Coyle, Claudie Blakley, and Ruby Bentall who is in Poldark. It was so nice to watch Julia Sawalha different from silly Lydia. I only ever seen her in Pride and Prejudice. They are all brilliant actors.

One sees poverty (and what misery it can cause), plus love, and everything between drudgery to refinement. I loved the interaction of the fortunate and unfortunate and how even with little, many of the characters were able to enjoy life with its sorrows as well as with its brighter moments. Well acted, and the story line was wonderful. Loved the language spoken and the manner of expression of both the educated and the uneducated. A real, genuine treat.

Characterisation, never a strength, became even closer to caricature, and the story lines were mostly beneath notice. Brendan Coyle (did he leave to make ""Downton Abbey""?) was even more crucial to the success of the series than I had realised; his absence just pointed up the deficiencies of the show itself. For all the talents of some of the other cast members, this truly ended with a whimper..",1483315200,2,465,4.753086419753086
4392980,5,B004K4FUUC,"All of Lark Rise are excellent. We have enjoyed watching them and couldn't get enough of the simple life-style with it's innocence. The step back into the past, the glimpse of life as it was in the late 1800's and the endearing characters as they weave their way through Victorian life made us all yearn for that sort of quiet, uncomplicated living.
If you like Old England and it's quaint village life you'll love this series; unfortunately it's only too short with it's four seasons.  The acting is commendable and believable; this is a show worth the watching and I know we'll be watching it again and again.

4393009,5,B004K4FUUC,"We love the series, however, the streaming keeps stopping and with a long hesitation it will begin again. Only to stop again.
We've called customer service and we've rebooted and followed their instructions only to experience it all over again.
We've talked to a tech support person and went through another process to experience the poor streaming again.
A third call now into customer service and the usual remarks that it's our TV or device. Honestly?
On no other app or program does this poor streaming occur. We watched the entire series of Downton Abby and had minimal issues.
The last customer service person further advice uscand said she would make a return call to inquire of our reception within a couple of hours.
Imagine that, No return phone call.
We are VERY discouraged!!!!!
Plus all Represenatives are Very difficult to understand their English.
Very disappointed and dissatisfied!!!!!

Filled with humor, common sense, and compassion, the episodes hold ones interest.
Lovers of BBC presentations will recognize actors from several other series, such as Call the Midwife, Downton Abbey, Pride and Prejudice.

How they dealt with the changes that all of us have to handle as the years progress. Some called it progress, others called it losing a simple but better way of life.

4393233,5,B004K4FUUC,"We love this series.  The acting and character development is of a high caliber.  Brenden Coyle, aka Mr. Bates in Downton Abbey, once give again gives a first rate performance.  The series is filled with so many unique characters who make one laugh and cry.  If you like late 1800 series you must see this one! The only criticism I would give the final series is that some loose ends were left hanging.  Like why didn't Brendan Coyle show up for ending.  Nothing was said about him nor Nan or Alfs parents who went to find a home.  I just like clean tied up endings.  But still loved this series.",1474848000,,596,4.3545454545454545

Every story has just enough drama to make it interesting but not enough to cause stress or anxiety.  Every episode has a happy ending.  If you want an English show that is entertaining but not too thought provoking, this is the one.  It is a cross between Little House on the Prairie and Downton Abbey.",1473206400,,415,4.554054054054054

I was hoping for more of a ""big finale"", ends a bit predictably and quickly and with no mention of the main character's future, detailed or resolved (the writer of the book).  From what I have heard, they ended the series abruptly (only 6 eps as opposed to 10 like in the previous seasons) because the BBC creator/writer left the series and BBC felt they couldn't do it without him...alas, a fun series to escape the norm.

If you like period pieces that show how we have developed into the industrial age, you will enjoy this. They start out walking town to town and by horse and get into railroad in season 3. Prejudices between ""city"" and village folks are handled in a very constructive and loving way. There are behavior lessons to be learned in every episode.",1472774400,,478,4.7023809523809526

Takes you back to a rather (in my opinion) unrealistic story from the late 1800s.  Very idealized.  But that didn't stop me from enjoying the stories.  Season 4 wasn't the best of the 4 seasons, but at this point, we are so attached to the characters that we enjoyed it never the less.",1469318400,7,452,4.385542168674699

Oftentimes the plight of ""women's rights"" can often make their female characters unbearable! Laura and her mother, especially Laura  sometimes got too close to this mark and that was when they seemed too brash and froward; but, at least it wasn't as bad as the Dr. Ogdan character from The Murdoch Mysteries!(She was sooooo unattractive as a feminazi!

As this was a shortened season, as well as the last, these resolutions made good sense and good viewing.  My understanding is that this series lost their writer, and this is the reason for the shortened and final season.  These characters are so dear that I agree with not continuing with another writer, but sad for the abrupt ending. Worth watching, again and again.",1466467200,,484,4.670588235294118

As with many series that have to wrap up story lines well before hoped, the pace of the final two episodes were out of sync with the previous seasons. I do have to say that the cricket episode with Margaret was poignant and delightfully resolved. Definitely my favourite of all four seasons.

4393871,5,B004K4FUUC,"So sad to see Lark Rise to Candleford come to an end.  Season 4 was bittersweet.  Wasn't sure what to expect given the limited number of episodes in this final season, but it did not disappoint.  Numerous loose ends were tied up, and several story lines were brought to a happy conclusion.  Unfortunately Brendan Coyle was off making Downton Abbey, so he never actually appeared in Season 4. Nonetheless, this gap was filled by the expansion of the roles of the Pratt sisters, Minnie, and the new love interest for Dorcas Lane.  So sad to see these characters go, but the final show left us with both smiles and tears.  Needless to say, this entire series has been a real treat and I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a sweet escape to Victorian England!",1465516800,2,758,4.5777777777777775

The humanity and touching wisdom in the way characters are portrayed, slowing revealing the reasons for their behaviour are truly moving. Everyone involved in this production should be cheered to the rafters and begged for an encore. I hope, as do all I know also, that the screenwriters will be asked to take the series on from where the books end, and never stop giving us new tales of this golden idyll, where the community sheltered those living within it's boundaries, as an extended family does, as opposed to our dislocated times. If you watch this series, you will be fully rewarded, your only regret will be that you can't enter the screen and stay forever in Candleford. The performances by everyone are rich with humanity, pathos, comedy and utterly stunning. I have grown to love everyone that lives there and everything about Candleford, so will you.

The first three seasons had 12 episodes apiece so I was thrilled that Season 4 only had six episodes... This series was interesting and captivating although the perfection of ""the ever so helpful"" Dorcas' life was getting irritating by the end.  Only after I had watched episode 6 did I realize that it was the final episode and I was DONE!

One of the things I found compelling about watching this series was seeing so many actors and actresses that have appeared in other period dramas.  Queenie is in the current Call the Midwife, Mr. Timmons left for Downtown (not oxford :-) Ms. Timmons and Dorcas were in Cranford.

4393966,5,B004K4FUUC,"My One Weakness - Dorcas Lane
First, as a long-time, huge film/movie Fan, over the past 10 years I keep returning to the Classics, and have loved Reading and Watching anything to do with Charles Dickens genre (David Copperfield, Oliver Twist, Bleak House, Great Expectations, etc, etc)
Why? because Hollywood has shifted to a consistent menu of young, brainless Super-Heros, all sugar-coated, laughing stock productions via wholly-dependent on a Humongous diet of CGI + Special Effects. How many Transformers, X-Men, Captain America, Fast&Furious, etc, can one take?. Just to clear, I love CGI + SE, but ONLY in the Sci-Fi genre ... Yes, more please!

That said, the BBC has long been known as the undisputed world leaders when producing both Modern & Period Drama for TV, and locally featured on PBS in the US.

As a linguist, I'm really interested in local and regional Dialects. One of the other reasons I have become such a Huge Fan of BBC, is to re-acquaint myself with the ""King's English"", so succinctly and properly spoken in various dialects, meters, and tones; along with the proper Manners of the day.
It's a absolute Joy to hear and enough to induce a diabetic coma in a wordsmith.
In addition, it clearly marks the distinction between the British English and our American one(s).

An adaptation of Flora Thompson's autobiographical novel ""Lark Rise To Candleford"", set in 19th century Oxfordshire, in which a young girl moves to the local market town to begin an apprenticeship as a postmistress.

After Pride and Prejudice, Jane Eyre and then Cranford, I thought that the BBC had peaked. Man, was I wrong. After watching other UK suggested titles like North & South, The Paradise, Daniel Deronda, Bleak House, Cranford, etc, and then Lark Rise, all my doubts were removed at once, as I fell in love with all the characters, especially Julia Sawalha (my own one weakness), who surpasses herself, obviously moving away from her most famous role as Lydia Bennett in Pride and Prejudice, and she totally Rocks My Twister - Dr. Seuss Socks!

Story-line - The hamlet of Lark Rise is sleepy, and just as enthralling as the 'modern' town of Candleford. All the little stories within each episode, as well as those expanding throughout the entire series, make it a joy to watch, while being excited to see the next episode, and the next ... The characters in this little community manage to rise above their conflicts, see past each others' foibles, with an inherent support and love for each other.

I was surprised by just how much we ALL have In Common, simply because it transported me into my own past and tapped into my solo & family experiences, good/bad behavior learning curves, superstitions, constant dramas ... all in my very own Northern New Mexico, rural/farming/ranching hamlet, and just down-the-road to our nearest tiny, Town, with its own downtown, tiny Square with Clock.

Lark Rise is a great example of how much we are all experiencing the SAME dramas and foibles in 2016, that is depicted in this 19th century series. Even the Characters feel exactly familiar to me, albeit, with modern Names. I have known People like Twister, Emma & Laura Timmins, Thomas Brown, Alf Arless, Dawn French & Queenie ... Havent we all?
Seems like the character played by Dawn French received a lot of ""hate"" reviews before. I believe that is is merely People ""projecting"" their Family members, whose alcoholic (or addition) personality, drama, irresponsible behavior and Girth, is playing back some form of family-own related sense of family-related humiliation. Dawn French ""Nail's"" her character being appropriate for our own present AA circumstances.

This Period Drama Series is reinforced by a gorgeous soundtrack, beautiful camera work, amazing sets, scenery, and costumes, seamless fine directing (via 13 Directors), and a rich cast of interesting characters. Each episode focuss on one or two of the little anecdotes of the story.

The production values are exquisite; the costumes are colorful and ravishing, with the sets lavish and the scenery is gorgeous. The scripts are of exceptional quality, funny, poignant and endearing, and the direction and story lines are exquisitely fine. The acting is also truly OUTSTANDING, Julia Sawalha is a sheer delight especially, and well supported by Dawn French, Linda Bassett, Sarah Lancashire and Mark Heap.
My Own One Weakness - Julia Sawalha!

Set locations - The landscapes were ""extraordinary""... without a doubt a rival to many of the great landscapes in Cranford, Jane Austin, and Downton Abbey. Lark Rise is based on Juniper Hill in North Oxfordshire near the Northamptonshire border.

Downton Abbey, has also run it's own course, with some of it's actors that ""made their bpnes"" in Lark Rise, Cranford, and others, before Downton.

Can't wait for the next BBC Period Piece ... I hope that it's more of the same, as my table is full of delights and my fireplace is crackling ...

Until next time ... Aloha from the Hawaiian Archipelagos ...

4394210,4,B004K4FUUC,"I like this show but its beginning to disappoint. I thought one of the main themes was strong women who define their own social roles. But eventually it all falls back to being a mother or wife. It  is never quite carried through that the women have the right to opinions and are not ""nags"" or ""butting in where they don't belong"". The show, in a weird backhanded way, keeps saying that indeed they are. It also makes you feel that women are unfulfilled unless they adopt or borrow children that are strangely available. The behaviors and points of view are modern but projected into the past, and it isn't as convincing as something written in the past. I don't believe there would be all that public kissing on the high street between Laura and various young men. Mrs. Timmins would never rush into the tavern to fight with her son and insult her neighbors. But there are still many great moments in the show, so I keep watching...and enjoying.",1460851200,,946,4.564705882352941

4394360,3,B004K4FUUC,"A charming series but after a while the characters' sweetness or earnestness or self-righteousness or nobleness (depending on the character) can become somewhat boring/predictable and/or irritating.  So, we watched it over an extended duration but interspersed with some edgier programming.  The period costumes, depiction of the times, and social mores are interesting.  The episodes intermittently weave (still) timely issues - such as women's rights and freedoms - into the scripts.  A few of the characters (ex. Queenie and Twister) are just great, portrayed by very good actors.",1416960000,,583,5.666666666666667

After episode 6 was over, I click for ""next episode"" only there wasn't one....  :(  Such a tremendous let down.  The acting was not bad, it was the writing and just the feeling of, ""That's it, that's it, that's how they are going to leave it.""  Grrrrrrrrrr....  very frustrating.

In an earlier season the distance between the towns was measured to equal 8 miles, yet these people come in and out of each other's towns like it was a few blocks....drives me crazy every time. 8 miles each way is 16 miles every trip, and yet they can do it and be home before dark.",1412726400,,427,4.219512195121951

Circa 1895 is portrayed as a more content time than now, even though many lived day to day wondering if they would earn enough for food and to pay their rent. They must have put more trust in our creator than we do nowadays. They got by somehow. Farms I know about were small back then, and were meant to sustain the family. What surplus the family didn't use was sold so that things like shoes could be purchased.

The only trouble with this is that this whole series in bundled in with Season 1 and in order to get to the subsequent Seasons, one must go back through the whole of Season 1, clicking ""next"" at the bottom of the screen until you get back to where you stopped watching. Obviously one is not normally going to watch all 4 Seasons at one time so this get a bit perturbing after having to do it several times and by the time I got to this Season I just skipped ahead to watch the 7th and final episode.

4394590,3,B004K4FUUC,"Season 4 was not as good as the other 3 seasons.  It had some good and some not so good.  The characterization lacked depth. Some of the characters annoyed me. You feel the lack of Mr. Timmins, and Emma Timmons turned into a downright harridan. Twister made me want to punch someone, preferably him. Laura was wishy washy and fought with her boyfriend to the point that I thought he was going to just leave the show. And last of all, Thomas and Margaret. She seemed so out of character in the last two episodes. I was glad that there were only 6 episodes in this season.",1405641600,,570,4.317757009345795

They managed to do what most series cannot do - maintain the highest quality in story line and acting season after season. On a funny note, I just recently found out that Julia Sawalha also played Saffy on Absolutely Fabulous. She always looked familiar but I could not place her.  What a great comedic character she was on Ab Fab! I am a fan!  But all in all, Larkrise is  of the best tv watching experiences you could ever have.",1404691200,,549,4.20952380952381

Although most story lines are tied up, the viewer is left wanting resolution to all--especially how marriage and continued careers resolve for Dorcas and Laura, how Thomas and Margaret adjust to a baby, how Alfie and Minnie adapt to marriage, and how younger siblings and Sydney develop as young adults.

4394652,5,B004K4FUUC,"Thoroughly  enjoyable and relaxilng to watch! Several comical charectors keep the show lively. It's a show you can ""sink into""",1401840000,,126,5.3
4394653,5,B004K4FUUC,"This series is very family friendly. It is about the inhabitants of 2 communities (one poor and the other rich) whose lives are intermingled. The joys, triumphs, and sorrows are shared by all.",1401667200,,192,4.848484848484849
4394654,5,B004K4FUUC,"At first the pace of the show seemed slow and uninteresting until I found it soothing and a welcome change from the nerve-jarring crime shows on regular TV. Chases in Lark Rise and Candleford were either on foot or horseback without explosions. Soon the characters enchanted me and I looked forward to seeing them in my spare moments. I would love to be the woman Emma was. The restraint in sexual matters was refreshing.

As a whole I found the show endearing and uplifting. If only there were more.",1401667200,,500,4.617977528089888
4394655,5,B004K4FUUC,I thoroughly enjoyed the characters.  It was an interesting look into the lives of people living at that time. Couldn't wait to see what happened next.,1401580800,,151,4.8076923076923075

4394657,5,B004K4FUUC,"Yes, it takes a while to get through 4 seasons but it's worth it. It's amazing how certain characters unexpectedly become your favorites as the series develops. Minnie is a treasure!",1401580800,,182,4.903225806451613
4394658,4,B004K4FUUC,"I just started watching this series. its a great story line. and the characters stories and very well done.
I still have many more shows to watch but it holds my interests as I love the time it takes place.",1401580800,,206,4.175
4394659,5,B004K4FUUC,I like this because I am a fan of British drama and British comedy.  The actors do a wonderful job.  Dawn French is great and all the others are so captivating.  I was very happy to be able to watch this for free on Amazon prime whenever I wanted and the whole series.  It made it worth the price of the Amazon prime fee this year.,1401580800,,331,3.9696969696969697
4394660,5,B004K4FUUC,This is a another great series.  The characters were interesting and you seemed to know them.  I didn't want this to end.  I will definitely watch again and again.,1401494400,,163,4.551724137931035

4394662,5,B004K4FUUC,"Lark Rise nearly turned me off in the beginning.  Too tame.  And then they got rolling.  Powerfully good acting, story lines well laid out, quiet lessons -- totally well put together.  You could teach kids from it.

Season Four seemed rushed.  It's only 6 episodes long and, frankly, I was left thinking it should have been just a little longer.  I felt a bit as if I were being pushed out by tired hosts.  Were they constrained by time that year?

That said, some of the themes were exceptionally well handled in this year (especially the theme of honesty and responsibility), and as in all the other years, the acting is worth watching carefully.  These people know their craft.

I found the series restful.  And, though understated, the poverty of the Lark Risers really stuck in my mind.

No violence, no swearing, just daily living and how they lived it -- with some lessons thrown in.  It's a win in my book.  I've seen it 3 times now.  And, yes, I'll watch yet again.",1401321600,,974,4.511494252873563
4394663,4,B004K4FUUC,"This series is a little more sentimental than I like but once you get in to it it's enjoyable.
I've seem most of the cast in other BBC performances and they're great. The story lines depict a much simpler time and at first it seemed a little sugary to me but it has a good message.",1401235200,,281,4.035714285714286
4394664,5,B004K4FUUC,I loved every season of this delightful series. The British are unparalleled in producing films and series with charm and beauty. The characters in this delightful story are endearing and humorous. I especially appreciate a series that brings each character's story to a happy conclusion. I highly recommend From Lark Rise to Candleford to anyone who would enjoy an escape to the exquisite English countryside among engaging friends.,1401235200,,433,5.382352941176471

Too bad for the actors and for all the viewers who loved it.",1400889600,,312,4.777777777777778

4394677,4,B004K4FUUC,I have enjoyed the entire series but thought that the Season 4 series was abruptly ended.  The slower pace of the series was more enjoyable.,1400630400,,140,4.6
4394678,3,B004K4FUUC,"We were very disappointed to see that Mr. Timmons left the show (probably to become Mr. Bates on Downton Abbey). Also disappointed that the series ended after the 4th season, probably due to the loss of key actors. We still found it a wholesome, refreshing program, though, and, while there was little ""pizzaz"" involved, it was down-to-earth entertainment. We watched all the episodes of all four seasons.",1400457600,,405,5.059701492537314
4394679,4,B004K4FUUC,"This was a wonderful series, even Season 4 was good although not as good as Seasons 1-3.  Robert Timmins was sorely missed in the final season.  The last episode tried to show everyone lived happily ever after but I'm not sure it was realistic.",1400457600,,244,4.5227272727272725

4394681,5,B004K4FUUC,BBC did very well with this.  The story lines in Season 4 were better than those of the first 3 seasons.  It is a shame that they canceled it.  It's like loosing old friends.,1400371200,,174,4.0588235294117645
4394682,3,B004K4FUUC,"I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED Season 1, 2 and 3.  Could not wait to watch each show!  Amazing storytelling.

But Season 4 - not so good.  Only six shows long, and clearly not the quality of the first 3 Seasons.  Don't know if they switched writers, directors, or because the major character ""Robert Timmins"" was mysteriously not on the show any more.",1400284800,,342,4.540983606557377

4394685,5,B004K4FUUC,"The writing is so good, and the characters continue to develop in fascinating ways. There is increasing harmony between Larkrise and Candleford. This series is something we need more of - a vision of the way the world could be better. There is so much wallowing around in the darkest sides of life. The media needs to catch on that where we put our collective attention - that grows!",1400112000,,383,4.565217391304348
4394686,5,B004K4FUUC,"Great family entertainment...America could produce this caliber of program if they wanted too.

4394688,5,B004K4FUUC,"Love this program and have to say was disappointed that this was the end of it on Prime. There were some gaps in the storyline from season 3 to season 4, and wondered if there were episodes that were not available from Amazon.",1400025600,,226,4.27906976744186

4394691,5,B004K4FUUC,I enjoyed every episode of this series. Each left me thinking how grateful I feel to live at a time that a program as good as this is  to watch when I have time to watch.  I am enjoying my Amazon fire so much because there are programs like this available for me. I enjoyed the singing and music as well as the stories. I found it great fun to watch as well as thoughtful.,1399852800,,372,3.9466666666666668
4394692,5,B004K4FUUC,We love the wholesome family and neighborly relationships in this show. It takes you back to times when life was hard but everyone pulled together. The lack of violence and immorality is so refreshing. The only thing we hated was it had to end. We wish it could have gone on longer.,1399852800,,282,4.4423076923076925

4394694,3,B004K4FUUC,I didn't think that the writing was as good in this season. It felt as though the writers were tired of the characters and now that they had developed them they didn't quite know what to do with them.,1399852800,,200,4.153846153846154
4394695,4,B004K4FUUC,"This series was just finding its way at last when its creator bailed. Maybe wrenched his back laying on heart-warm with a fire hose.  Well worth watching though even though its boob as bard shtick was old early. The usual wonderful Brit players. Unfortunately, a few of them are playing characters you'll just hate. Parental Warning for Twee.",1399852800,,342,4.896551724137931
4394696,5,B004K4FUUC,WONDERFUL STORY LINE WITH GREAT CHARACTERS. I WAS SO SAD WHEN I SAW ALL THE EPISODES (FREE AT AMAZON PRIME).  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE,1399852800,,135,4.625
4394697,4,B004K4FUUC,Great series but there were only 6 episodes.  The picture quality was excellent and the sound was very good.  If you are an Anglophile and like Victorian era pics then you'll love this series.,1399766400,,192,4.617647058823529

4394699,5,B004K4FUUC,"I liked this quaint, interesting drama, set in two small hamlets in turn-of-the-century England.  The story was easy-going and very well acted.

4394703,5,B004K4FUUC,I love the whole series of Lark Rise to Candleford. The characters are delightful and the stories touch on some very real and very common human experiences.  Too bad there aren't another 10 seasons to enjoy!,1399507200,,207,4.75

4394714,5,B004K4FUUC,"The setting, costuming and excellent cast make this BBC series a high quality production. One is ""drawn in"" to the characters and story quickly enjoying the developing personalities. It is one series one doesn't want to end!",1398902400,,224,5.081081081081081

4394718,3,B004K4FUUC,The story has run its course.  Most of the actors are so good that they can make things work even with the weak storyline.  The show stopped after this season for a reason.  Nothing surprising or interesting going on.  The latest actor was either weak or didn't have something suitable to work with.  You could easily skip this season.,1398470400,,335,4.610169491525424
4394719,4,B004K4FUUC,This last season is much shorter than the first three.  The absence of Brendan Coyle is noticeable.  I was not as drawn into this series compared to the last three.  Still enjoyable and sad to see this end.,1398470400,,206,4.368421052631579
4394720,4,B004K4FUUC,I have watched season one thru three and enjoyed them all. Season four was equally loved but way too short. It didn't seem to be complete. Laura and Mr Timmons weren't even in the last episode. Didn't seem to tie the story together. Loved but disappointing.,1398470400,,257,4.608695652173913
4394721,5,B004K4FUUC,"Like the rest of the series, Season 4 is fantastic.  If you're an anglophile, a lover of period pieces, can appreciate fine performances from an ensemble cast, or ever loved such series as Little House on the Prairie or Anne of Green Gables; this is the show for you!  Every single episode, from Season 1 on, is funny, touching, dramatic, thought-provoking, and leaves you wanting more.  The last episode seemed just a little rushed, but there was a lot to tie up.  It didn't really bother me...at least not as much as knowing there wouldn't be any more of Lark Rise or Candleford.  A true British treasure.",1398384000,,607,4.635514018691588

4394723,5,B004K4FUUC,I have thoroughly enjoy all four seasons of the Lark Rise to Candleford TV series.  This type of programing is sadly lacking in recent years and I hope the BBC reconsiders and decides to produce more of such programs.  I discovered the program this month April 2014; and watched all four seasons instead of the currently available prime time television.  I was extremely disappointed that the final season only contained six episodes.  I am very fond of the Downtown Abbey Series; but I enjoyed the Lark Rise to Candleford series more.,1398211200,,535,4.846153846153846
4394724,5,B004K4FUUC,"Thank you to the actors, and everyone else who is involved in the making of this series.

4394726,5,B004K4FUUC,"I thoroughly enjoyed all seasons. Couldn't stay away, binge watched.  They don't make series like this anymore.  It's about relationships, community, caring.

4394727,5,B004K4FUUC,The location used for this series is a wonderful insight into how it was to live in England all those many years ago. Well worth watching.,1398124800,,138,4.346153846153846
4394728,4,B004K4FUUC,"My only problem with this series is that I wanted more. I loved the characters, found that I could identify with their situations and wished for more.",1398124800,,150,4.592592592592593
4394729,5,B004K4FUUC,"Season 4 is a very short (6 Episodes), as I must conclude that the departure of actor Brendan Coyle, who played Robert Timmins...who went to the now acclaimed series Downton Abbey (Mr. Bates), caused the writers of Lark Rise to Candleford to draw the season and the series to a conclusion. This is abundantly obvious as episodes 1-5 are very good episodes (as usual), but give no indication to the viewer that a conclusion is in the works. Episode 6, from the very beginning gives you the immediate impression of a writer bringing characters & relationships to a point where the viewer will be somewhat satisfied with the outcome, and for the most part...not want or need more to know what happens to who. EXCEPT FOR LAURA!!!!! HELLO??? Although there are numerous strong characters in this series, I have always considered Laura Timmins (daughter of Robert Timmins) the focal point of the series, and the one who documents the lives of those in her community. I'm fairly certain that she and Daniel end up getting married, but you never know with Laura. She is so very strong, and her opinions come with conviction...that it will take a unique individual for Laura to see as her mate.

All of this said....this was such a wonderful series, with superb writing and a strong cast. I put off watching Season 4 as I realized that it was the final season with only 6 episodes to emerse myself into. If I could rate the series higher than 5 stars...I certainly would. And if the writers ever decide to revisit Lark Rise to Candleford, I am quite certain that they would have an audience so ready to see where & what their favorite actor(s) are up to. Love love love this show. Watch it. You will Not be disappointed.",1398124800,,1711,4.628289473684211
4394730,5,B004K4FUUC,The beauty of most BBC series is that they're timeless and Lark Rise to Candleford is exemplary.  I didn't want it to end as the characters became part of my life.,1398038400,,163,4.258064516129032
4394731,4,B004K4FUUC,A happy ending to a great series. I'm guessing that Brendan Coyle's (Mr. Timmins) new role as John Bates in Downton Abbey was a major contributing factor in closing the series with only six episodes in season 4,1397779200,,210,4.552631578947368
4394732,5,B004K4FUUC,Sorry to see that it stopped production. Enjoyed the wholesome themes of the series. Watched the entire run season 1 through 4.,1397779200,,127,4.818181818181818

4394734,1,B004K4FUUC,"Seasons 1 and 2 were good, 3 started to taper and 4 was as satisfying as week old Thanksgiving dinner leftovers.  I watched it partly out of guilt, partly because I thought surely they wouldn't end it this terrible (which they did) and partly because I had already invested so much time into it.  End with Season 3 and you won't feel cheated.",1397779200,4,342,4.412698412698413

4394743,5,B004K4FUUC,This is the fourth season in a character study of village and town folk in rural England. Both places are populated with intricate characters as well as simple souls. The show is not all sugar coated it shows that people are not good or bad but are a delicate balance of both. There are good moral points made in most of the episodes and I found it very fun to watch and not nearly as predictable as it could have been.,1397347200,,419,4.185185185185185

4394747,5,B004K4FUUC,"With all the trashy demonic shows on American tv, it was a relief to find a show like this.  The acting is top notch and the narrative is fun and interesting.  Hollywood...  you're freaking fired!",1397347200,,196,4.542857142857143

4394752,5,B004K4FUUC,This series has been great.  The only drawback is that all good things must come to an end. You will enjoy it!,1396828800,,110,4.0
4394753,4,B004K4FUUC,"Like ""Call the Midwife,""  "" Larkrise to Candleford"" is a period piece with a heart.  Set in the late 1800s, its characters are grappling with real human dilemmas: struggles of the heart, how to live in a culture where roles are rigidly set by gender and class; and dealing with the inevitable ""demon"" of industrialization and the changes it will bring.  It is a show about real community, and how it can save us; and it always gives a lesson about how we don't have to keep our secret selves hidden in order to experience real love and friendship. As this was the final season of the series, I found myself very sad to part with these characters.  You will find many seasoned British actors here, recognizable from other PBS and BBC productions.  They infuse their characters with grit, flaws, and a continual openness to what life is bringing.",1396828800,,844,4.6375838926174495

4394761,5,B004K4FUUC,"There were wonderful characters in this entire series, and I enjoyed seeing the culmination of four seasons of growth in age and personality. Each of the endearing people had become such comforting presences, so it was hard to let go when the last episode ended.
The one exception was the complete absence of the character 'Robert' played by Brendan Coyle. We were to believe that he had gone to another place to earn money to send home to his struggling family, but I could only think that the 'other place' was 'Downton Abbey' where he went on to woo and marry Anna.",1396569600,,568,4.578431372549019
4394762,5,B004K4FUUC,"This is one of the best BBC drama series ~ Unfortunately, it ends without conclusion.  Sort of leaves you hanging - seems like a lot of the British shows on Amazon Video do just that - no conclusion to the series. Very disappointing",1396483200,,232,4.395348837209302

4394765,1,B004K4FUUC,"Lark Rise had the most endearing of characters for the most part.  Loved the period, loved the class warfare, such as it was.  The ending was pretty poor, leaving a  lot of unanswered questions and characters that just disappeared.  The writers wrapped it up quickly and left us hanging.  I thought it was interesting and overtly obvious that the producer had a distinct hatred for Christianity as the so called Christian characters were portrayed as buffoons and hysterical hypocrites.",1396396800,7,486,5.10126582278481

4394767,5,B004K4FUUC,"I was sad to see it end. With only six episodes in the last season it felt a little too quick to end for me, but as they say all good things must come to an end. I read that they had to cancel the show because one of the main creators of the show left. I respect the producers for closing down the show rather then let it decay in quality like so many other good shows do when the main creative visionaries or actors for the show have ether left or died. better to go out on top then to drive a good story into the ground.",1396396800,,522,3.7981651376146788

4394780,5,B004K4FUUC,"This is one of the best shows I've seen set in this timeframe! I LOVE it! They created some of the most ""human"" characters I've ever seen on a show.

4394806,5,B004K4FUUC,"I really enjoyed this series and the production values were very good. I felt I was entering a special place and watched an episode a night and couldn't wait for the next. The stories were well done and all the cast were brilliant. It is old fashioned in a good way with small town characters that are bound and involved in each others lives. It is a coming of age saga and also the story of grown people with very real emotions and challenges. I especially loved the postmistress and her ""one weakness"". The story reminded me of the Anne of Green Gables stories. It was emotionally satisfying and every episode had humor too. I couldn't wait to watch the next episode and now I want to watch it all over again! I recommend this to anyone who likes human stories that depict the family of man in a warm and wise manner.",1395273600,,819,4.359477124183006

The story line kept our interest without to much sensationalism. I would recommend this series to anyone who is tired of the same old thing, and enjoys good clean entertainment. Do be advised that there is a small amount of witchcraft, a few subtle innuendo about pregnancy, and a slight bent toward feminism.",1394841600,,480,4.865853658536586

4394825,5,B004K4FUUC,"My wife initially started watching this series and I would occasionally watch when I had time. However, I began to notice my 7y/o daughter's interest, so we be began watching it as a family. Even my 5y/o son watches with us and at least seems to enjoy it!  None of the racy themes that are frequently present in Downton Abbey, so I feel free to watch it as a family.",1394582400,,366,4.228571428571429
4394826,4,B004K4FUUC,"I was addicted to this show. The acting was wonderful and the story lines very interesting. It ended rather abruptly and I didn't think that Dorcas's romance with Gabriel was not developed as well as it could have been.

4394830,5,B004K4FUUC,All of the characters became real and easily believed.  I could get lost in the story and not realize the end of each episode was near.  I have shared this with friends and have told them not to miss this wonderful series.  I'm sure I will revisit each episode in the future.  I hope there will be a season 5.,1394409600,,309,4.1
4394831,5,B004K4FUUC,"To say that ""Lark Rise to Candleford"" is a classic is simply an understatement.  It is among my all time favorite shows on the planet and may even be #1.  Give this as a gift to someone (or to yourself).",1394409600,,203,4.05

4394834,5,B004K4FUUC,"I am American, so I am endlessly fascinated with British life in the pre-industrial age.  There is so much education hidden in this witty little series.  The later seasons are not as ripe with class-based and political quandaries for the characters; it's more personal demon type stuff.  (I think this is because the main character's father, Robert Timmins, now of Mr. Bates fame on Downton Abbey, is missing.)  Nevertheless, thoroughly enjoyable -- a nice, slow-paced, beautifully filmed work that has no violence, no bad language, and no nudity.  It's reminiscent of Little House on The Prairie for me.",1394323200,,604,5.122448979591836
4394835,4,B004K4FUUC,"A pleasant, predictable closing to a pleasant, predictable series. The one unexpected quirk was that there was no definitive closure for Laura. Could there be more to come?",1394236800,,172,5.178571428571429

4394843,5,B004K4FUUC,"This was, by far, the best television program my wife and I have ever seen.  Virtually every actor deserves a ""best supporting actor"" award, and every episode was riveting from the opening credits to the closing credits.  In the very first episode, we're introduced to the main characters, and we're immediately drawn to them as each one possesses qualities, and values that are easy to identify with.  The biggest disappointment came at the end of Season 4, Episode 6; when we realized that that was the end.

I understand that all stories have to end, but I can't help but feel that the producers could have done more with this one; they left us with too many unresolved issues, which could have been resolved with one more season.  None the less, don't miss this program!",1394064000,,774,4.703703703703703

4394845,5,B004K4FUUC,"Even though the season was ending...and you could tell...it was refreshing to watch a few more episodes.  I do believe that the last episode or two was rushed.  Still want to hear about their lives and feel like the faithful viewers were robbed of so many more stories.  If they had made maybe six more episodes they could have gone out on a high note.

The setting, the characters stay with the viewer.",1393632000,,387,4.608695652173913

Maybe I missed the information (I watched the series over a period of time and may not have picked up on some details) but what surrounded Dorcas's adoption of her son, why did Robert not return, what happened to the original blacksmith?

4394886,2,B004K4FUUC,It left you unsatisfied. To this point it was one twist after another with happenings and it was as if they decided to wrap it up quickly and not put much thought into the end. To this point however it was sheer enchantment.,1392249600,,224,4.232558139534884
4394887,5,B004K4FUUC,Loved this series.  I miss the characters and the wonderful stories.  Each show always taught great life lessons in the way The Walton's did so many years ago.,1392163200,,159,4.642857142857143

4394896,3,B004K4FUUC,"My comments are solely based on episode 1, where I thought that Dorcas character should have evolved as the series progresses.

4394926,3,B004K4FUUC,"Which broke my heart. The series changed after that, the writers slipped up writing for Mrs. Timmins and they weren't able to ever regain their footing.

The make up artists apparently changed because even Laura Timmins looks a bit worse for the wear, and the Pratt sisters makeup does them less justice than usual, and the postman's wife looks a little unfamiliarly painted. It's a mercy, really, that they ended the series in six episodes instead of the customary 12 of the previous series. At least they leave everyone seemingly happy, except poor Mrs. Timmins, in their swift wrap up of storylines. For that I am grateful.",1391299200,,626,4.850467289719626
4394927,5,B004K4FUUC,I have so enjoyed this series. My favorite characters were the lovable outspoken Minnie and the ever proper Mr. Thomas Brown.

4394931,3,B004K4FUUC,"I really liked the first 2 seasons but the third started to get repetitive. The fourth and final season - which is just a half season - is supposed to tie up loose ends. It does and it doesn't. Season 3 suffered by a lack of character development; all had become stereotypical by this point. In season 4, it is worse. Brendan Coyle is gone (to Downton?) but his character is supposed to be away working. John Dagliesh seems bored to tears with his Alf Arliss character. Dorcas and the Browns finally get what they've so long desired, which is heartwarming. The beautiful sets and costumes remain and are still a pleasure to see. All in all, an uneven season but worth watching if you've already seen the previous 3.",1391040000,,715,4.507692307692308
4394932,4,B004K4FUUC,"""Lark Rise to Candleford"" is a well-written drama series punctuated with lots of humor and occasionally some pathos. Much of the acting is first-rate and the production values (especially design) are superb.

What stops me from giving the series five stars is the inability of the writers to refrain from looking at the late 19th century through an early 21st century lens. I realize the series is based on memoirs written by a woman who did live from the late 19th through the mid-20th century. In all honesty, I haven't read these memoirs (although I would like to). However, I'm fairly certain the author did not offer all of the opinions and observations spoken by the characters in this series. And many of those opinions and observations (especially concerning feminism, religion, and the impact of technological innovation on rural society) simply don't sound plausible coming from the mouths of people who are supposed to be living in the period from 1895-1898.

Having said all that, I enjoyed the series tremendously. I found it a wonderful escape from daily life and an all-round satisfying source of entertainment. I adore Julia Sawalha's Dorcas Lane, admire Mark Heap's Thomas Brown, and feel great affection for Sandy McDade's Margaret Ellison Brown. Oh, and the little boy who plays Sydney is more or less irresistible.

Though I find the the series flawed as an introduction to British social history, I highly recommend it as an entertainment--which is obviously what it was intended to be!",1390953600,,1507,5.044176706827309

4394935,3,B004K4FUUC,"Not as good as the first 3 seasons; somehow the spirit was lacking in most of these episodes.  Nothing interesting was happening with Laura, after she chose Daniel, which made sense, even though most of us we're rooting for Fischer.  Robert was absent from Lark Rise, and this removed the dynamic of the Timmons family from the tapestry; Dorcas' possible new partner, Gabriel, just didn't have the appeal of the others.  But overall it's. a great series, a joy and a relief from all of the 'edgy' programs full of vulgar language asnd behavior.  I've recommended if go friends.",1390867200,,577,4.797979797979798

There was some drama, but not over the top as in Downton and certainly none of the cheap frills designed to tear at the watchers hearts in such drastic ways: Sybil (sp.) gone, Matthew gone, Thomas the jerk, Anna being raped!? Larkrise to candleford was able to resonate with both those who understand town life and those who understand farm life. This last season seems rushed, maybe because they knew it was all coming to an end. We will buy the series and watch it with our grandkids down the road someday.

The stories incorporate serious family issues, ethical and moral dilemmas, as well as many other aspects of human behavior whether during times of struggle or victories, and was laced with great humor.

The episode in Season Three concerning the harvest and measles outbreak in Lark Rise is so well done it should win a prize for excellence. The cast is perfect and the setting beautiful. We appreciate this family friendly storyline with a minimum of off-color scenes and are beginning  to appreciate it even more in some ways than the acclaimed Downton Abbey series which sometimes leaves us feeling too much assaulted by scandal.,1390348800,,537,5.090909090909091
4394948,4,B004K4FUUC,I thought this series was really good.  I was sorry that it was cancelled.  I thoroughly enjoyed it because it kept my interest and it was pretty clean of sex and violence.,1390348800,,172,4.34375

I must say that the last season was a little weak in story line.  The writers seem to struggle with how to end the series and although they brought "" a sense"" of closure to the circumstances of some Lark Rise and Candleford residents, there were still quite a few unanswered questions. I would have liked to see the series continued.",1390348800,,446,4.6923076923076925
4394951,5,B004K4FUUC,"I slowed down watching these because I was so sad that they were ending so soon.  If you like period family dramas, then this is for you.  The acting is wonderful and everything wraps up the way you hope that it will.  I do agree with previous reviews that the last season seems very rushed and as if they tried to pack everything into one episode.  But I'm the kind of person who HATES hanging endings, so that was actually ok for me.  It would be lovely if they would bring it back for a 5th season. . . .(also, re: Brendan Coyle, I wasn't too sorry to see him leave.  He kind of plays the same character over and over again.  I get it, it might be that his face lends itself easily to playing this type of man, but his character in this was almost a copy of his character in North and South and also to some extent Bates in Downton!)",1390262400,,836,4.060975609756097
4394952,4,B004K4FUUC,"i have enjoyed every minute of every episode, and like everyone else was sad to see it end. i must agree with most other reviewers that while season 4 is still enjoyable and entertaining, because it was only 6 episodes, it felt a but hurried to tie up the loose ends. i wish it could have been stretched out to 10 episodes, there was certainly enough action to warrant that many episodes. instead they crammed it all into 6 episodes. but of course it was still well performed, with interesting storylines. just be warned, it will seem a little lacking compared to other seasons. certain strings were tied together, but others (i won't spoil anything) were not resolved. oh geez just thinking of how this could have at least been extended for a full season...the possibilities would have been quite entertaining! too bad!!

 also, just as a personal opinion, i found the attraction between dorcas and gabriel not quite believable, especially compared to the attraction between her and sir timothy or even james dowland. not sure if its because gabriel isn't as handsome (just being honest!), but really they did not have a romantic chemistry and i found it hard to believe she would ever fall for him (or him for her...). i wish they would have picked an actor that had more chemistry with her, it would have made the season wrap up better. i almost wish that post office inspector from season 1 would have popped back in, he was easy on the eyes... ;)

nevertheless, lark rise to candleford is still an excellent series and i am sad to see it end. however, i will surely come back to it in the future as the acting is absolutely splendid and i just love period pieces, especially with this setting of small town/rural england. beats the heck out of charles dicken's london for me any day!",1390176000,3,1788,4.616352201257862

4394960,5,B004K4FUUC,"Lark Rise to Candleford is a very sweet, loving series.  I am about to finish season 4 and find I am having withdrawal feelings for the characters. I suppose if Brendan Coyle were to continue with Lark Rise to Candleford, there would be future seasons.  I watch Downton Abbey with Brendan Coyle.

The stars are well cast in Lark Rise. There is a quality of maturity in the characters that is so refreshing.  Problems there will always be, but the problems are solved with such understanding and success.  As I watched the women walking through the streets with their dresses dragging along behind them, I wondered how long it would take to fray the hems and wondered how dirty the hems of the dresses became.  This is a period series showing the women dressed to the nines and the men dressed for work. A bit of history is coming to an end with this series.  Farewell.",1389830400,,868,4.5256410256410255

I'm so sorry there isn't more to see of this.  I fell in love with every single character and appreciated their imperfections and vulnerabilities.  Even the characters I started off not liking, I grew to love and saw them as special people.  How disappointing to now have to go and find something else to watch, knowing most everything else won't even come close.  The one fault of this series is this:  I did not care for the way certain things happened without explanation.  For instance, what happened to Nan?  No word, no explanation.  Why didn't Ruby's suitor come to meet her sister and call on her?  No explanation.  Other gaps were present too and were just never mentioned.  But I couldn't find it in myself to deduct even one star off for these random strange occurrences, because the stories were just so good, so warm, so loving and it really takes you away from every day life.  Why can't we have shows like this in the US, where not every actress is a model?  There are so many mature women in this series, strong women characters, women that do not look as if they've had gobs of enhancements done, it was just terrific.",1389830400,,1304,4.560344827586207

4394993,5,B004K4FUUC,"This is a charming and worthwhile series that both my 16 year old daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed.  It was my daughter who noticed that ""Dorcas Lane"" was ""Lydia"" from the 1995 A&E version of Pride and Prejudice.  I may have never made the connection, the characters are so different, although both have spunk.

This series features endearing, well-developed and vibrant characters, an excellent story line with continuously interesting developments along with sage wisdom, humor, and many heartwarming moments.  I've laughed, chuckled and cried with the inhabitants of Lark Rise and Candleford.  Although not avoiding difficulties, misunderstandings and heartbreak, this series celebrates families, friendship, community and the attributes and attitudes necessary to sustain them -- acceptance, forgiveness, courage, loyalty, forebearance, etc. In the last season, there seemed to be more emphasis on faith. I missed Robert Timmons (Brendan Coyle) in the last season and was amused that the new character, Gabriel Cochrane (Richard Harrington) seemed to be offered as his replacement and even resembled him. Both the character and the actor were a welcome addition and added interest and appeal.  The delightful ""Minnie"" (Ruby Bentall) was introduced just in time to add hilarity to the series and to give it a lift.

I could have watched several more seasons and was sad to see the series end, but the writers ended it with care and gave the viewers several sources of satisfactory closure.  The ending didn't feel rushed even with all the loose ends being tied up.  Although I would have liked a different ending for Ruby Pratt's Pontefract liaison but perhaps that is wanting too much.",1388880000,,1690,5.299625468164794

As much as I love Downton Abbey- I think this program has shown a better and much more realistic view of the working class and the wholesomeness of the hardworking 'poor' people.
The ending was put together quickly as they had to make it all come out right but I feel they had no choice as I understand they were gobsmacked to find out they were being cancelled.

The main characters' acting got on my nerves from season 1 and i started to only listen to avoid Docas' simpering and Laura's batting her eyelashes whenever she got upset. Dorcas never really seemed to have anything nice to say. Very selfish if you ask me. and the ""hamlet"" storylines, for all i knew it almost could have been straight out of a modern trailer park. Honestly i only really enjoyed Mr. and Mrs. Timmons, and Queenie. They held the show together for me. i can not believe i watched all the way through it. took weeks though. only watched when there were no new episodes of my other favorites. It is an okay series but kinda boring and dragging and kept losing characters without much ado. weird but i guess that's British Tellie for you.",1386288000,,882,4.553459119496855

Even though it is set in the past the problems that the people experience in Lark Rise and in Candleford are relevant to people today because they are problems rooted in human nature. I enjoyed the games and songs and work of the time period that the author was trying to record because customs were changing fast.",1386288000,,598,4.930693069306931

What about William & Margaret (and their hopes for a baby), what about Laura (did she finally marry or did she stay at the post office), what about Dorcas (& the several men who came into her life), What about the fold in Lark Rise and the sisters.  So many ways to have gone on!  I will miss the times spent with these wonderful characters.",1386028800,,422,4.172839506172839

4395043,4,B004K4FUUC,I really enjoyed the series Lark Rise to Candleford. The series was well written and there was a great ensemble cast. The writing in seasons one through three had a lot of interesting twists and turns. I was anxious to see how the series ended. Season 4 was still pretty good but I enjoyed the first three seasons a little more. I was a little surprised about the way that they chose to end the series. Overall season four was still pretty good.,1384992000,,445,4.373493975903615

4395048,5,B004K4FUUC,"Really, really appreciate this charming series. It tugs at my heart. I absolutely love the way everyone makes mistakes, accepts the consequences, forgives, tries again, and allows others the same freedom.

4395052,4,B004K4FUUC,"I enjoyed watching this series.  I like period pieces and this one hit the spot.

The characters were wonderful, with good casting and acting.  Every character had their own unique personality.  You got a taste of the more proper upper class and the laid back lower class.

I did find that the characters acted a bit immature at times, especially when it came to dealings with one another about love and attraction.  It was also a little unrealistic with how the classes mingled.  The other unrealistic thing was how there were hints of Atheism when it came to Dorcas's views.  I felt that in this time period, speaking of Darwin and such would not be taken well in this time.

--------Spoilers---------

I'm going to discuss some of the characters here now, because I feel it's interesting to read what other people thought of them.

I loved Minnie's character.  She was full of life and you could tell she felt emotions to the extreme.  She was also pretty amusing.  I have known someone similar to this in person so these people do exist.  I really was impressed in the scene where she told off Mrs. Arless.  She really was a dynamic actress and her spirit was admirable.  Usually characters who are proclaimed as ""unattractive"" get sulky and depressed but Minnie stayed positive and knew her good traits so this was nice to see in a tv show.  I also noticed how since Alf's mother was so full of life, it made sense that he chose a girl who also was very spunky.

I liked Dorcas Lane also.  I thought she was extremely pretty and even though she was a bit older of age, she had a beauty which shined.  She was a model of grace always showed a proper face to the public, serving them delicious foods.  I noticed she seemed very good at showing when she was sad underneath but was mustering up a smile to greet people with.  This sort of sad look though did seem to get a bit repetitive as she often wore it.  Probably my favorite scene with her was on the prankster night.  It was nice to see her having some fun.  I wasn't really happy with who she ended up with though.  I didn't really see what spark was between her and her choice, and the guy honestly seemed a little shabby in dress and I hated his stringy bangs.  She was more suited imo to someone more prince-ly or king-ly.  I couldn't help but feeling she just clung on to this guy because he was a man and around.  I felt that her original love interest was more suited for her, and I found it sad that he ended up sticking it out in a less-than-ideal marriage.

My other two favorites were Twister and Queenie.  Twister was pretty hilarious with his quips and strange gallivanting personality.  I liked his dynamic with Queenie: the wise strong beekeeper of the town.  I admired Queenie's character.  She seemed to hold the town together in a way.  Though I wondered sometimes where they got their income from to stay in their cottage.  My favorite scene with them was definitely the dragon fight.  It was pretty amusing- you got to see their dynamic come out here, and their reconciliation after the fight was sweet.

I thought it was a little odd that even though Laura Timmins was the narrator, she was not one of the strongest characters and did not often become the center of the show.  I didn't think this was a bad thing as her character wasn't that great, although it did seem odd that her narrative at the beginning and end seemed to have quite a bit more wisdom than her character did.  I suppose it could be her narrating as an adult with a more grown-up mind which could explain it.

The Pratt sisters were quite interesting too.  They came off as sort of the more sinister meddling characters at first, but then showed their softer sides.  I saw some symbolism there where they were always dressed in black at first, yet once their characters got softer they changed to brighter clothes.  I admired the elder sister for her strength, and the younger one for her heart (Though Ruby's constant teary-eyedness got a tad annoying).  Regardless, they made a good team.  I was disappointed we never got to see Ruby's love interest though.

Anyway, I could go on as there were more interesting and likable characters, but I will stop there.  What I really loved about this series was that not one character was all good or all evil.  They all had their faults and showed both their good and bad sides.

One point of disappointment in the show for me was when they showed the ""ghost.""  This show seemed to be set in a realistic world, and I felt that the ghost spirit contradicted the setting in this series.  I felt it would have been better if they had left us guessing who the girl really was, leaving it open to be a real person who was caught up in the story of the past.  Yet when they showed her basically disappearing in thin air, I found this to be out of place and a little silly.

Overall, I really enjoyed this series.  It was a fun ride and I was sad to see it end.  I will miss this world of Lark Rise and Candleford and wish they would make more seasons.",1384300800,11,5039,4.416304347826087
4395053,5,B004K4FUUC,"Each time I watch this wonderful collection of home spun stories  it  is like going for a visit with good friends in a special time and a special place. The actors were true to  the characters, and each one came to life in a very real way.  So sorry they are no more.",1384300800,,267,3.981132075471698
4395054,3,B004K4FUUC,"This series gets a bit trite toward the end, no chemistry in the love interests, they should have stopped at series 3",1384300800,,117,4.363636363636363
4395055,3,B004K4FUUC,"I watched the entire series within a couple of weeks, and the one thing that kept bothering me was the constant lack of continuity. While the general story lines and characters were interesting and engaging, many times characters would just drop off of the series, never to be seen, or heard of, or spoken of again. There were so many loose ends leftover by the end of the series that I had to wonder if the producers had any clue at all about what their jobs were. It seemed to me--especially in the later seasons--that the writers and producers just gave up, or just didn't care about the series anymore.

The final six episodes were very rushed--especially the last episode--and I cannot believe that so many characters--including the main character, Laura--didn't appear for even a moment in the last episode. Heck, there were main characters that didn't appear at all in the final season. I've noticed this trend with BBC programs, where actors and actresses seem to jump from job to job without satisfactorily completing their roll first, and no one seems to mind the mess it makes of the series' plot and story lines (Downton Abbey is a great example).

In conclusion, it was a fun way to waste some time on my days off, but I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone. It's sad, because most of the actors/actresses did a fantastic job throughout the series (those that actually stuck with it). But, in the end, I don't think that the producers or writers did the cast any justice at all.",1384214400,13,1493,4.673003802281369

4395106,3,B004K4FUUC,unfortunately as the seasons progress the story line is slipping somewhat. It is still ok but could be better so only a three,1380499200,,125,4.478260869565218

4395112,5,B004K4FUUC,"The only problem is there is not another season.  I was so involved with the characters all due to the writing, directing, and the performances of the actors.  Not to mention the beautiful two towns of Larkrise and Candleford.  Thank you to who ever brought this story to life for me and the many others who have and will watch.  Lovely just lovely.",1380067200,,349,4.492063492063492
4395113,4,B004K4FUUC,"This show is so well done.  I must say that like other reviewers of this season, I am disappointed that it felt rushed to a climax. It almost feels as if it was decided to end the season part way through so the last 2 shows were made to finish everything up.  It wasn't a very satisfying end to the series.",1379894400,,306,4.0

4395118,5,B004K4FUUC,"Simpler times are shown in this series. You are drawn into their live and you get to know and love so many of the characters. Alfie was, by far, my favorite. He was a wonderful character.

The scenery in this series is gorgeous.

This is a show I will go back and watch again.",1379462400,,276,4.092592592592593

4395121,5,B004K4FUUC,"Delightful characters facing and coping with timeless life issues. A look at life in a gentle, kind community that also faces its dark side. Every episode is carefully and tightly constructed. I only wish there would be another season.",1379116800,,235,5.051282051282051
4395122,5,B004K4FUUC,"Not sure why all the other Lark Rise to Candleford episodes are in Blu-ray and this one is not , but I bought it anyway. The quality is still very good even though there are less than the usual amount of episodes. My understanding is the director decided to leave and the powers that be put the kibosh on it. A  shame. Anyway, if you love the other episodes, you'll have to buy this to finish it out.",1379116800,,400,4.128205128205129

4395127,5,B004K4FUUC,"I love all the BBC period series very much! I get great enjoyment from watching them. The story lines are well written, the acting is fantastic, costumes & sets delightfully accurate.
I have one problem with their series, they seem to just stop them. They have a tendency to speed up the story lines just to meet that end. Sad that they don't continue with these wonderful stories. I read reviews on their wonderful series and it seems that the majority of people feel the same way. Why start something wonderful that people love to watch only to run it for a season or two and abruptly end them? I don't understand that, if it was not received well I could understand cancelling them but when people love them why stop them?
I hope the BBC which has a fantastic history of making great series would consider this when they decide to cancel a series. I wonder who the person is that makes those decisions, maybe they need to check to see what the public, not just in the UK wants but what people all over the world would like to view. I think they need to hire another firm to do their statistics on what is being watched and what isn't.
I certainly hope the BBC doesn't do what the U.S. television stations have done and go with nothing but so called reality tv, there are many more people trying to find other options to watch series in the U.S. because like me we are really getting sick of the so called reality TV shows. Hope the U.S. television stations wake up and get rid of this mindless dribble they consider entertaining! It seems that U.S. stations, even the National Geographic Channel have jumped on this reality bandwagon, which is very sad that there is nothing educational, or even entertaining on U.S. tv, hundreds of channels with absolutely nothing to watch. It seems in the U.S. anyone doing anything can become an instant television star and have no acting talent at all, just get out there and do anything and you can be a star. What's next? The sitting watching commercial channel? Oh yeah we already have that it's called watching a TV show and having a commercial interrupt it every 2-3 minutes to sell us something!
Come on BBC more of the period dramas and wonderful entertaining series!!!
Thank you from an avid BBC fan in the U.S.",1378857600,,2260,4.514634146341463
4395128,5,B004K4FUUC,"Great characters.  Some are silly, but most are lovable and handle difficult situations in realistic and caring ways.  The show gives a good idea of the difficulty of living off the land in the late 1800s in England and how they managed to make a go of it under very difficult conditions - up to the time of the railroad coming in and changing their lives completely.",1378512000,,367,4.462686567164179
4395129,5,B004K4FUUC,"I absolutely loved this series. I am so bummed out that they cancelled it so soon. Apparently a lot of other viewers felt the same way. I hope they will come back with maybe some 2 hour specials, like some other series have done.",1378425600,,229,4.2272727272727275
4395130,5,B004K4FUUC,"We thoroughly enjoyed the whole series of ""Lark Rise to Candleford"". We could hardly wait for the next episode.  It is a clean and refreshingly wholesome series, which we greatly appreciate. We especially liked how through out the series, the characters became richer and the story lines more complex. This is one we will watch many times over. We were sad there weren't many more seasons, and that the last season was only half as long as the other 3 seasons! Please bring more like it:)",1378339200,,488,4.674418604651163
4395131,5,B004K4FUUC,"This was a very interesting series.  I truly enjoy the PBS and BBC shows.  It makes me realize how much to be thankful for in these times versus in the 1800 and early 1900's.

4395139,5,B004K4FUUC,"What a disappointing end to a great series. This cast, crew and production team put together a truly exceptional story that continued to feed our enjoyment through every show we've watched. For it not to still be in production is disappointing
I often wonder what happens when a series such as this just ends.
Each of the final episodes was entertaining and enjoyable. Although a short season, we were able to watch a simple end to a fabulous season.
We will miss this show immensely.",1377561600,,484,4.705882352941177
4395140,5,B004K4FUUC,"I really didn't want this series to end. The love, values and the fear of progress were always part of the stories. People showed their vulnerability, acceptance of the hand they were given and played but there was always hope and faith to keep them going. Faith in themselves, their neighbors and the land. In these trying times it really did ""take a village"" because everyone needed each other for things big and small. Beautifully written.",1377561600,,442,4.828947368421052

4395145,5,B004K4FUUC,"Though the setting is a couple centuries and an ocean away this product is relevant today.  People must work through life each day using what they have to attain what they want and the people they want in their life.
Psychology, faith, politics, class division, needs and wants, love, failures, success.....all the drama of today has existed in one form or another throughout the years.

The characters are charming and their depth is revealed as the series progresses. Their resolutions to the challenges they encounter are sometimes comical as well as clever. The acting is excellent. The whole family can watch this.  It beats the staged ""reality"" shows.  I watch it for free on my Kindle Fire HD through my Prime Membership.",1376524800,,516,4.5978260869565215

4395164,5,B004K4FUUC,"This is a series that the whole family might enjoy.  I watched it at night in bed to wind down and feel relaxed so I could sleep.  No violence or language issues.  It's a story about two villages/towns where one is where the fieldworkers/laborers live and the other is for the folks with more income.  It shows the differences but also how we are all the same and valuable members of the villages.  One young lady has moved from the 'low to the high' city to work in the post office with the postmistress/owner.  It's quite unusual for this to happen, but shows the absolute power of a person who works hard, has good moral character and the perseverance to achieve what she wants.

The actors seem tired of the characters they're playing. the scripts turn darker, but also thinner, an odd  mix. Certainly missing Brendan Coyle who was off being valet on another show. The last  episode is thrown together in slap dash fashion to get the happily ever after feel, but doesn't  ring true. Still, I wouldn't have missed it. A bad grade for this series is still high related to anything else around",1375574400,,511,4.473118279569892

4395197,5,B004K4FUUC,"Lark Rise, the ""poorer step-child"" of the town of Candleford is a village where the residents are, for the most part, content with their simple way of life. Laura Timmons, the eldest of 7 children of a stone-cutter and his wife, is sent to work for their cousin Dorcas Lane, the Post Mistress for the more affluent Candleford. Laura sees a different way of life there. The Candleford Post Office is the heart and soul of the town. It is where townsfolk meet to pass along news and gossip and to seek advice from the wise Miss Lane. It is also the Post Office for villagers of Lark Rise, so there is much back and forth between village and town.

This series revolves around the lives and loves of residents of both places and follows their stories over the years. You will meet many colorful characters over the course of the series. Some heroic, some pitiful, some hateful at times. But you'll find yourself cheering on many of the people you'll meet and wanting very much to be able to help others.

If you love a good period-piece from the BBC you'll no doubt enjoy Lark Rise to Candleford.",1374364800,,1093,4.4874371859296485

4395206,5,B004K4FUUC,"Lark Rise to Candleford is truly the best BBC series I've seen through the years.  Yes, all you Downton Abbey fans (I'm one, too) Lark Rise is even better than Downton.  Focal character, Dorcas Lane, is the quintessential ""Celtic heroine"" in the image of Brighid, herself.  Dorcas owns the Post Office and the Forge, so is at the very center of the community and indeed holds the Candleford town together as its clear and present fount of wisdom.

Meanwhile, in Lark Rise, the characters are as realistic and likeable as Miss Lane/Dorcas ... Queenie the herbalist/druid woman of wisdom, Robert as the struggling artist/stonemason, and Emma the everywoman w/ a heart of gold and steely determination.  All the Lark Rise folks show us what life is like in the hamlet just outside of Candleford.

The sense of community and interconnectedness of the population portrayed is an attitude I try to adopt and live in this current American Facebook, Twitter, et al, society.  The characters' foibles and idiosyncrasies are timeless, but their deep care and acceptance of each other, though disagreeing with each other occasionally, is an admirable trait that needs to be emulated and fostered.

The makers of the series ended it rather abruptly - baffling for such a great show and we're still upset about it every night now when the kids go to bed because we ""ran out"" of our new favorite show.  So bummed....  (yeah, I know we didn't pay for it and so can't say we got ripped off, technically...but it sure feels like it!)  We enjoyed it while it lasted; I just keep thinking that they must've made a spur of the moment decision to end the show because the script just was NOT set up well for it at all.  Well, I'm sure you've read other similar reviews; I'm not saying anything new.  Now we're almost done watching London Hospital - another great series...another one that is too short, but we've learned to brace for disappointment in that department.

Subtly addressed class distinctions and the impact of invention and progress were exposed in ongoing themes.

This series exhibited the morality, kindness and love of the characters for each other with every episode.  Quite a contrast to the many shows that celebrate ""dysfunctional"" families. The period costumes were also a delight to the eye. It was nice to see that all the main characters became settled in their lives at the end of the series. Hopefully, there will be other series like this in the future.",1370044800,,532,4.659574468085107

4395270,5,B004K4FUUC,"The entire series was wonderful.  I am assuming that the 4th season was the last, just with the story content.
I am sorry there will be no other shows, but I did enjoy all the seasons.  I have even purchased the book, so
that I can really get into the whole bunch of characters.  Well worth watching!!",1369526400,,301,4.245614035087719
4395271,5,B004K4FUUC,"This season wraps up the story lines.  It is altogether a charming world to escape to, but I only gave it 4 stars as it was a limited number of episodes with just that purpose; it felt a bit more constrained than the previous seasons.  Still, sorry to see it end.",1369526400,,263,4.137254901960785
4395272,4,B004K4FUUC,This season was not quite the mesmerizing as the other three and the ending was too predictably wrapped.  I am always disappointed with one of the main characters disappears.,1369440000,,174,5.0

4395278,3,B004K4FUUC,"While I enjoyed the entire Lark Rise to Candleford series,  pay heed to all the reviews stating that this shortened final season is too rushed.  A new character is quickly added to tie up loose ends and this feels rather fake to me.

Robert Timmonds (who apparently moved on to  the greener pastures of Downton Abbey) must not have been available and is sorely missed.

Laura, who feels like a main character throughout, is too much in the background. I wish that the filmmakers have given this series a better send off.",1368921600,,520,4.608695652173913
4395279,5,B004K4FUUC,"The best series I have watched perhaps ever, highly recommend. I enjoy the following of all the relationships and the struggles and joys of them. Also the disparity between working classes and how they worked through differences",1368921600,,228,5.1891891891891895

4395281,3,B004K4FUUC,I was disappointed on the way the last season ended.  The usual they get married ending.  No real original stories.,1368489600,,115,4.7
4395282,5,B004K4FUUC,"As we watch each episode we are eager to see the next.  Although we could watch one after another, we choose to savor the previous for a day or two before going one to the next.  Thus prolonging the enjoyment.",1368489600,,209,4.2
4395283,5,B004K4FUUC,There's a lesson in every episode that can touch lives in the everyday life. Each actor/actress's character were played very well and the episodes are addictive. So get ready to Enjoy....a step back in time.,1368489600,,207,4.942857142857143

I will say that the story line remains very high quality even after three seasons. Again I highly recommend it.",1368403200,,306,4.482142857142857

4395286,4,B004K4FUUC,"Please tell me there are more to come. The characters are charmingly flawed, yet redeemable. Twister is the one who occasionally shows that he too may yet make it - slow progress. I love Dorcas Lane most of all . Julia Swalha is the perfect Dorcas!",1368230400,,248,4.413043478260869

4395291,5,B004K4FUUC,Such a great story.  So sad BBC decided to end the story.  You can really get into the story and its characters,1367971200,,111,4.0

4395294,4,B004K4FUUC,"Again, many of your favorite characters are present in Season 4. The subplots are worked out so that you feel that there is a happy future in store for them all at the end. But, I felt that the last series really could have used at least two more episodes to bring the flow of the characters' lives to a smoother ending. I was puzzled by Season 4 being shorter than its predecessors until I read another viewer's comment that the show was going to finally be cancelled.  Therefore, the writers of the series had only a limited time to conclude Lark Rise to Candleford. I think they did their best to bring closure to the characters' lives, but I do feel that these last episodes were ""sped up"" in pace to try to create a conclusion. I was left wanting more, which shows how involved I was in all this whole series!  If you enjoyed the first 3 Seasons of Lark Rise to Candleford, then you will want to see how Season 4 concludes the series! However, you will probably wish the creaters were given more time to satisfy the viewers need to watch all the characters lives end with the same wonderful, old-fashioned pace created in the first 3 Seasons. I really enjoyed all the episodes of Lark Rise to Candleford!",1367712000,,1209,4.417040358744394

4395301,5,B004K4FUUC,"The last of the Candleford series. We watched and enjoyed every episode. It a testment to human nature. While the times and technlogy have changed, the day-to-day experience of life still has the the small (and sometimes large) ups and downs.

Candleford is the charming town, while Lark Rise is the hamlet. The tension and cooperation between the two added to the amazing character acting sets this series apart!

It's got the comfort and familiarity that comes from village life before technology dominated us all; combined with the wide variety of personal drama, some self-inflicted, some imposed from elsewhere... all of it sorted out in entertaining episodes. Wonderful character actors, Excellent meandering plot and top-shelf writing. We admire the attention paid to period dress. beautiful and helpful in creating the set for the audience.

The development of each evolves over time, and you find yourself wanting to know what characteristic will surface in the next set of circumstances faced.  In Seasons 1 and 2, I found the episode plots to be more complex with the storyline multi-layered than in Sessions 3 and 4.  By the last few episodes, the writing had deteriorated and the plots were a bit too simplistic.  However, overall, I enjoyed the series.",1366761600,,474,4.7439024390243905

actually develop over time just like real human beings.  A wealth of character types acted by true professionals.
Not a single car crash, knife slashing maniac or demeaning description of another human being.
It makes the cost of Amazon Prime a true bargain.  My wife and I sat through every single episode
together at night after dinner.  We laughed, cried, and enjoyed TV again together as a couple.  We used the
internet to learn more about that period of life in England too and also find additional work by the actors. First Class!",1365811200,,651,4.716814159292035

4395336,5,B004K4FUUC,Very enjoyable-We rationed the episodes so that they would not end too soon. Unlike many BBC programs we were able to understand the dialogue. Wwe miss dialogue on most because of the strong British accent-too much for some of us Americans.,1365465600,,240,4.878048780487805

The ""final"" episode does leave one hanging a bit and it would be nice to see the BBC continue this series to its conclusion. It was cancelled despite high ratings, go and figure. While this season is excellent, it does leave one wanting for more...especially for the outcome of Dorcas Lane!",1364601600,,426,4.618421052631579

4395352,5,B004K4FUUC,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST SERIES I HAVE EVER WATCHED.  I JUST WISH THERE WERE MORE SEASONS.  THE ENTIRE FAMILY CAN WATCH THESE EPISODES AND THEY TEACH SO MUCH ABOUT HUMAN FAILURES AND TRIUMPHS WHICH IS A PART OF ALL OUR LIVES. IT IS SIMILAR TO AN ENGLISH VERSION OF LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE.,1364515200,,292,4.196428571428571

4395359,5,B004K4FUUC,"I have become obsessed with BBC 19th century costume dramas.  With Season 3 concluding for Downton Abby, I was on the hunt for a new series to fill in my night time void and came across this series.  I instantly fell inlove; and while I still love me some Dowton- secretly, I kind of started liking this show a bit more. I've finished this series and am on the hunt again.  With a 6mos old that has yet to completely sleep through the night, these shows keep my unwanted awakeness pleasant.",1364083200,,490,4.362637362637362

Yes, most of them came from the one character, Dorcas Lane, but there were other wisdoms that were noteworthy, too.  I enjoyed all of the characters. They were well developed and with purpose. This series satisfied me as much as Downton Abbey though it does not have the level of wealth and it takes place, historically, prior to Downton.  It was the perfect series to satisfy me during the breaks between the Downton seasons.  I wish there were more than 4 seasons of Lark Rise.",1364083200,,571,4.461538461538462

4395367,5,B004K4FUUC,This is a wonderful series.  I love the story line and the characters.  The only thing that I can say I didn't like was how it just ended mid season.  Wish they would have continued on and at least wrapped up some of the story lines.,1363737600,,233,4.021739130434782
4395368,5,B004K4FUUC,"My wife and I have greatly enjoyed the Lark Rise to Candleford series.  We enjoy the beauty of rural England and the 19th century setting.  The characters are so believable that one gets to know each one and forgets he is watching playacting.  For us, watching the shows has become brief excursions of  total immersion into a community of genuine people in which we comfortably fit.  The plots are simple on their face but complicated in their unwinding.  Why complicated?  Because people are emotional creatures whose demeanor often belies their inner feelings.  These stories of ordinary people interacting in their day-to-day lives are manna from heaven for those of us who will not waste our time watching gratuitous violence and sex.",1363737600,,738,5.041322314049586

4395372,5,B004K4FUUC,Amazing! I love the this show so much and wished it would have more seasons and the actors are amazing. I recommend this to any of us who were raised poor and now have a middle class life as it brings back many memories as to what to be proud of for coming from humble beginnings.,1363392000,,280,4.017857142857143
4395373,5,B004K4FUUC,I loved this whole series! Season 4 was no exception. Just wish they could have found a way to keep it going! It was good wholesome viewing for the whole family. The plot and cast were fantastic...you just couldn't wait for the next episode!,1363392000,,241,4.5

4395377,5,B004K4FUUC,"Good story plot; suitable for the entire family.  Characters draw you into their lives, and, for a few moments, you actually live in a simpler time in Lark Rise or Candleford, your choice of a hamlet or a town.",1363219200,,210,4.384615384615385

4395379,5,B004K4FUUC,"I hate TV. I hate trying to sift through the banal and inane and downright crap, so instead I surf through Amazon streaming on my PS3. I get to watch all the things I've missed over the years, including my favorite Brit TV. Lark Rise never disappoints. What a lovely, refreshing time to spend with people who had real problems, who still practiced kindness and helped each other. I know things were harsh in those days, it's been well-depicted here. But I also remember a kinder time in America when we cared more about one another than we did a dollar - as do these people.

You'll fall in love with the characters, particularly Emma Timmins as played by Claudie Blakley who also played Charlotte Lucas in the Colin Firth version of Pride & Prejudice. She is a lovely actress and absolutely stole the series.",1362873600,,809,4.5793103448275865
4395380,5,B004K4FUUC,I loved it.  I only wish that there were more to watch.  The characters were rich and full in every respect.,1362787200,,108,4.095238095238095
4395381,5,B004K4FUUC,"The characters felt so real to me, that they became friends and aquaitances. There were times when they evoked genuine feelings.

I was so involved, I yearned for more when the series was over.",1362614400,,193,4.676470588235294
4395382,4,B004K4FUUC,I really enjoyed this series.  Tells the tale of two villages that are somewhat dependent on each other with different classes of people in each village.  Charming stories and some excellent characters and good story lines,1362614400,,222,5.138888888888889
4395383,4,B004K4FUUC,"I only give this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the not-quite-believable setting.  These towns appear to have the best dental care, hairdressers, and clothiers around.  Could have used a little more mud and dirty fingernails.
That said, the stories are wonderful taken as a snapshot into human behavior and personal interactions.  There are quarrels that do and don't get resolved.  There are resentments that do and don't smooth out.  There are well meaning people put down and weak people that can't seem to get past their weaknesses.  Overlaying all of this is the love friends and families have for one another, and the fact that these townspeople are stuck with each other for life and have to learn to get along.  In our mobile society today, it is a breath of fresh air.  As one reviewer said, this is a fairy tale series, and I add that it is a fairy tale that rings true on many levels.
Highly recommended.",1362441600,,916,4.611111111111111
4395384,5,B004K4FUUC,Why must I write something?  Why can't you take the five stars and let that be?  It was a good period movie well done.  Characters were well developed as well the story line.  I'd like to see more.,1362441600,,197,4.105263157894737

4395388,5,B004K4FUUC,"Lark RIse to Candleford Seasons 1-4 are all worth watching and may actually be addictive.  With the exception of one episode that follows a traditional British Christmastide dalliance with spirits, the various intertwining story lines are absorbing in both historical references to the mores of the late 19th century but also in characters whose personalities and relationships evolve in universally interesting ways.  The end of the series left me wishing for more.",1362182400,,466,5.458333333333333
4395389,5,B004K4FUUC,"There is something special and magical about this series. It is not a ""pollyanna"" show; some have compared it to""Anne of Green Gables"" but the characters are much more multi-dimensional, so human, with all the faults and frailties humans have. There is a realism to the series at the same time there is an optimism to it.  And yet it illustrates how idyllic life could be, making it look so simple that happiness is fully within our grasp.  You will love each and every one of the characters - even the unlikable ones. There is such a poetry to the commentary, a sort of spiritual enlightenment. I especially like the wit and wisdom of Queenie, the village beekeeper and medicine woman. I also love the spinster Pratt sisters (local dressmakers) and seeing the romance of Thomas Brown (postman) and the preacher's daughter Margaret unfold.  All of the actors are exquisite and perfectly cast.  Did you ever read something so beautifully written your skin tingled? It's like that. Funny too. It isn't preachy just elevating.  Each season is better than the last; my favorite is season 4.

In many period dramas the characters are either close to perfection (next to sainthood)--or living a life of debauchery (often the affluent who have all the advantages of life: looks, money, intelligence). I don't want to watch either. I don't enjoy Downton Abbey because I don't wish to dwell on just how dismal life is for people who have everything. People who have been given everything and have nothing. In Lark Rise to Candleford there are people who have a lot less and yet are thoroughly living and enjoying their lives.  Despite the difficulties of life (for everyone, no one is exempt), I prefer to aspire to happiness.  It breaks my heart that the series ends here:  the characters are all so dear to me and the series a source of spiritual enlightenment.",1362096000,,1854,4.786833855799373
4395390,5,B004K4FUUC,"Please, please, bring us another season of Lark Rise to Candleford.  It's true that several couples have found the love of their lives but Laura still has not committed.

4395391,4,B004K4FUUC,This final season  ties up all of the loose ends. Mr. Timmins' character is still referred to but he's no longer physically there as the actor moved away from Lark Rise and is now living as Mr. Bates at Downton Abbey (now that he's out of prison). Very like able characters in this period piece. Really enjoyed all four seasons.,1361836800,,328,4.466666666666667

4395396,4,B004K4FUUC,"Although I'd loved the whole Lark Rise to Candleford Series...Season Four was a disappointment. Definitely felt like school a month before graduation.

4395400,5,B004K4FUUC,"Lark Rise to Candleford is one of the very best family value based TV series to date. It's not about rank and privilege like Downtown Abby, but more about the problems facing common families in turn of the century England.

Good examples are set for young adolescents near puberty. Coping with the rigors of change, age and poverty are prevalent throughout the series.

I wish there were more to this series. I would buy it if there were.

I would definitely recommend it to all who enjoy good wholesome human interest stories.",1361145600,,527,4.706521739130435

4395426,5,B004K4FUUC,"I am just very confused why season four is being priced at nearly the same price as previous seasons when this set has 6 episodes and previous seasons contained 12.  Hmph...  That is my only beef.  It is really a lot cheaper to just buy them and download them instead.

But as far as the show itself is concerned, this might be the best season of them all.  Whereas most shows end with struggling ratings or actors just phoning it in, the cast and writing remain terrific throughout this season.  We don't get to see Robert Timmons again (no spoiler there), as the actor was either filming Downton Abbey or had some other contractual issue.  But the rest of the core cast is dazzling.  There are even a couple of surprise return characters.

The series is a drama, but is never really melodrama.  The plots are subtle and mostly involve the characters learning from mistakes or learning life skills from others in the towns.  In one episode we see the shock at a female attempting to play an off season, 'friendly' cricket match.  Situations typically involve work (or lack thereof), morals, neighborly differences, or even the effect a new lodger has on a house.

There is a reason the British went up in arms about this series being cancelled and there being only 6 episodes, but I think that ending the show while it is strong is a good thing.  The ending is quite good and leaves the viewer with a sense that things will go on and the towns of Lark Rise and Candleford will have to accept the coming changes - good or bad.

What a wonderful series this has been.  I applaud BBC for bringing quality shows to those of us in the 'colonies' (lol!), the states I mean.  If you haven't started watching this series, then you really should start with season one for the full dramatic effect.",1340236800,3,1789,4.5062111801242235
4395427,5,B004K4FUUC,"In the final season i.e. Season Four, viewers only get to watch six episodes. There is also a significant absence in the form of actor Brendan Coyle (who played Robert Timmins). In the story, Robert's character is portrayed as having gone off to work elsewhere to send money home to his family (in actual fact, actor Brendan Coyle had landed a meaty role in the period drama Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey). The first episode sees the introduction of a new character Gabriel Cochrane (Richard Harrington)who has lost his once flourishing foundry business to the bank and who is also recently widowed. Luckily for Gabriel, Dorcas offers him a job and a home and the people of Candleford welcome him into their fold. Gabriel however is intent on reclaiming his former position and vows to get back at the people who have cost him his livelihood. Emma Timmins finds herself at wits' end when the money sent by her husband Robert is lost by her son Edmund. In the second episode, Daniel Parrish who runs the local paper, organizes a poetry writing competition and Laura gets upset when there is insinuation of favoritism toward her (since Daniel and Laura are courting). In the third episode, Thomas the postman is ecstatic when he is put in charge of the church bazaar but clashes with the new reverend, forward thinking curate Reverend Marley. The reverend's relationship with Emma Timmins also gives rise to gossip. In the fourth episode, Alf and Minnie's love is tested when Alf wins the title King of the Fair and Queenie finds herself upset at Twister when he does something behind her back, involving a pig Queenie won. Episode Five revolves around a cricket match where Daniel is intent on victory against a neighboring town. Only problem is that Daniel's fledgling team lacks superior players, until he finds an unexpected star player. The final episode sees Gabriel working on an invention that may restore his wealth and standing, and it also focuses on the developing attraction between Gabriel and Dorcas. But are these two strong-willed and fiercely independent souls too independent-minded for their own good?

Frankly, I was rather underwhelmed by this final season. The actors did an amazing job in their roles, yet the stories just appeared to lack the extra 'something' that made the previous three seasons so special and incredibly addictive. None of the episodes in this season (well, except for the final episode perhaps) seemed to engage me as deeply as some of the episodes in the previous seasons - Dorcas' torment regarding her relationship with Sir Timothy Midwinter and the impact on Sir Timothy's wife (one of my favorite episodes was the one where Sir Tim's wife finds the abandoned girl and insists on raising her as their own given their childlessness, and then goes berserk when she finds Dorcas and Timothy have been sort of 'plotting' behind her back); the exploration of Emma and Robert Timmins' marriage and the episode where Emma tries to assert some independence and find her own 'voice'; the romance between Thomas and Ms. Ellison (their courtship is so comical yet sweet); the episode where both Candleford and Lark Rise come together to help with the harvest and the way the two communities deal with tragedy, and many more. I also did not care much for the character Gabriel Cochrane and felt the chemistry between Dorcas and Gabriel lacked credibility.

Despite the flaws in this season's episodes, I still gave it five stars if only because the acting was top-notch and the cinematography was spectacular as always. I will miss this series dearly and can only hope that the BBC will bring the cast back for at least a TV movie and tie up the loose ends - it would be a nice treat for the fans of LRTC.",1336089600,5,3746,4.8515625
4395428,5,B004K4FUUC,"Lark Rise to Candleford is a charming BBC period drama that tackles myriad themes, and is adapted from Flora Thompson's semi-autobiographical novel. In the first season, young Laura Timmins (Olivia Hallinan) leaves her village of Lark Rise to work as an assistant to the postmistress in Candleford, Dorcas Lane ( a brilliant Julia Sawalha who first impressed me as Lydia Bennet in Pride and Prejudice (Restored Edition)). Through the course of the first season, Laura discovers that she enjoys living in the more affluent town of Candleford, and experiences the pangs of adolescence, including romantic entanglements. Dorcas Lane, the kind-hearted and sensible postmistress also goes through some pangs of her own, largely to do with her friendship with squire, Sir Timothy Midwinter (Ben Miles) who is married to the beautiful and composed Lady Adelaide (Olivia Grant). In the first season, viewers got to see the themes of marital strife, conflicts between the upper and lower classes, romantic entanglements, and other issues played out.

By the second season, both Sir Timothy and Lady Adelaide have moved to London, but there is still plenty of drama in Dorcas' life with the arrival of James Dowland (Jason Merrells), a former inhabitant of Lark Rise, a local boy who has done well in life. A young clockmaker, Fisher Bloom (Matthew McNulty) comes to town, and Laura finds herself attracted to Fisher, though he seems oblivious to her charms, initially. Laura's parents, Robert and Emma Timmins (Brendan Coyle & Claudie Blakley) who have always been a very close and loving couple find themselves facing some marital strife in their marriage, and this second season takes an intimate look at their dynamics as a couple.

Season Three sees the introduction of a significant new character, Daniel Parrish (played by Ben Aldridge), a young journalist who arrives in Lark Rise with some life-altering news for the Timmins. The independent and strong-willed Dorcas Lane continues as Candleford's postmistress, and experiences some human drama of her own, taking on a role that she finds fulfills her immensely. Unlike previous seasons, Dorcas' story is no longer the only dominant thread this season, as other characters begin to get more screen time, such as postman Thomas Brown (Mark Heap) and his devoted wife Margaret Ellison (Sandy McDade); Minnie the maid (clumsy and awkward yet so innocent and plain speaking); the wise and at times clairvoyant Queenie Turrill (Linda Bassett) and her simpleton husband Twister; young Alf Arless (John Dagliesh), the Pratt sisters, Ruby and Pearl (Victoria Hamilton and Matilda Zeigler), and others.

In the final season i.e. Season Four, viewers only get to watch six episodes. There is also a significant absence in the form of actor Brendan Coyle (who played Robert Timmins).

I know some have criticized the last season, but I thought it was well done. I grew to love each character and the meanderings of their lives. Old Twister, though, he was one of my favorites. He was a true curmudgeon, but a lovable one! Dorcas was a treasure as well. My advise? Watch the last season!!",1315958400,,459,4.411764705882353
4395435,3,B004K4FUUC,"If season 4 is any indication what would have happened to Lark Rise had it continued, I'm glad the nail was put in the coffin.

There are six episodes for this season and only one really caught my attention. That was the one where Mrs. Brown was going to play cricket. I thought that one captured the magic of previous seasons. The rest were pretty dull. The pig episode with Twister felt like an older episode as well, but I hated Twister as a character so I couldn't stomach the episode. I know others loved this season, and I wanted to as well, but I think the writing was lacking. Minnie was also bothersome. I think she became more annoying as the series went on.

The last episode deals with change coming to Lark Rise. I thought this should have been weaved throughout the previous 5 episodes. Anyway, season 4 is wrapped up with a nice little bow. Overall, it was a good season but not the greatest, and I wish the BBC would have allowed additional episodes to be made of this season. Perhaps then  it would have been better.

It's nice to watch the final 6 episodes so you can see what happens, but it isn't necessary. I'm sure everyone can figure out what happens on their own, if they let their imagination run wild.

I strongly suggest people renting this from blockbuster or netfix. I think the price for this DVD set is too high for what you get.",1313280000,3,1360,4.380952380952381

The production of this series was extraordinarily well done, and the actors were amazing. I would advise anyone who watches it to view all 32 episodes first, then watch the extra features afterwards, starting with the last DVD in the final season (4)which includes a discussion of the village in which Flora Thompson, the author of the book on which the series is based, grew up. After that piece, go back from the beginning of the series and watch the extra features; not all the DVD's has extra material, but at least one in each season does. Fascinating material and very well presented. The producer and everyone who worked on this series, have gone to great lengths on authenticity of costume, tools, politics and practices of that time. I'm already looking forward to watching the series again, but for now, I have purchased Flora Thompson's book, ""Lark Rise to Candleford, a trilogy"" whose 500+ pages promise to provide several days of delightful reading.",1312243200,6,1266,4.707207207207207

I also came here to find out why I only got 3 episodes, but after reading that other people had 6, I looked and my DVD holder just needed to be flipped over. The other one was on the other side of it. So I still have the pleasure of those last 3 episodes to watch tonight.

I can't get enough of Lark Rise to Candleford.

I'm annoyed though, because they are canceling it, so I'll think of some negatives that I wouldn't have otherwise mentioned, <grin>, along with the positives.

NOBODY could be better than Alf, Twister, Twister's wife, Queenie, Dorcas Lane and, last but definitely not least, MINNIE! I adore Minnie! I also loved Thomas and his wife, Pearl and Ruby, and all the rest. I will miss each and every one of them.

If there WERE any negatives, I might include:

What were they thinking as they wrote the part for Laura?! Boring.

1) Laura's part was boring even though they kept giving her new romances.

2) Each season when a new young man came to town, you would just know that Laura has a new love.

3) Laura got her boring side from her father. The only excitement in his life was when he fell off a ladder or lost his job, although he had values and ideals which he fought for, he did it in a boring way. Okay, maybe it was more 'realistic' than boring, but he I would say that he demonstrated a low-key passion for all that he believed in.

I think I'll go back and watch Season 1 again and mope. I wish they hadn't decided to cancel the series.",1308873600,,1543,4.203389830508475
4395443,3,B004K4FUUC,"Season four (4) of the BBC series ""Lark Rise to Candleford"" brings to a close this series.  Having watched Seasons 1-3, I, of course, desired to see how it all ends.  Once again, in viewing Season four (4) of ""Lark Rise to Candleford "", I derived a break from my usual viewing habits of watching Murder Mystery/detective shows and intense dramas by watching this beautifully filmed program about the lives of some extremely nice folks living in early ""Victorian times"" in the very poor village of Lark Rise and the ""better off"" village of Candleford in England.  Once again, the times that are portrayed are so innocent and the problems that arise to be solved are, to me, so inconsequential.  However, they are indeed solved without any violence or cursing by some of the nicest, most wonderful people that I have ever seen on the big or small screen.  All of the ""happenings"" are seen through the eyes of Laura Timmins and mainly happen in the post office in Candleford where Laura is learning to be Post Office Mistress from Dorcas the super-good and kindly headmistress--Dorcas is acted by Julia Sawalha of ""AB FAB"" and ""Pride and Prejudice"".( By the way, the character of Laura's super good almost self-righteous father is gone in Season four working in London; however, her mother takes his place in the ""goodness department""  weeping,  worrying and ""gnashing her teeth""  a lot more in this season thus her father is not missed too much.)

In Season four (4), I had a great deal of trouble putting my cynicism aside because I found all of the characters to be just too intently good and the situations to be just too farfetched (i.e., the episode about a snake was very unbelievable to me and a little too ""preachy"" for me to deal with).  I am rather glad the series has ended because I really do not think that I could take another season of all of the ""goodness"" that is being portrayed.",1308441600,3,1895,4.6467065868263475

We are left to assume that Laura marries the journalist.  Laura's father is gone the whole time, however, it is only briefly explained why he had to leave.  The relationship of Dorcus is completed to a degree but no marriage ceremonies just promises.

I assume the series was dropped very quickly half way through the fourth series.  I feel like I got ripped off by paying almost the same price for the other series that were double the amount of episodes or more.

Also, we could do without Queenie's fortune telling through out all four series.  These are occult practices not Christian for sure!

I have to concur with other reviewers that this season was rushed and that I am DEEPLY disappointed that BBC decided to discontinue it.  I did feel that despite the rush, they tied up the loose ends I wanted to see tied, albeit faster than I would have liked.  Only one I would have liked a bit more closure on was Ruby and her fella from Pontefract.

Brendan Coyle definitely was missed, I kept hoping for a surprise appearance and am a bit disappointed BBC didn't manage to coordinate that.  That said I think they acted around his absence relatively well and the other characters gave very enjoyable performances.

4395455,4,B004K4FUUC,"My only negative comment is that it is only 6 episodes where other seasons are longer.  But the story and the characters remain true.  If you have seen the other seasons, do not hesitate to purchase this one.",1304294400,3,208,4.447368421052632
4395456,5,B004K4FUUC,"Lark Rise to Candleford is one of the best movies we have purchased in some time.  We enjoy the English period classics and this one is perfect.  We have all 4 series and just hoping there will be more to come.  I must admit, there were a few scenes that could have been omitted, they really didn't add to the movie and I felt they were a little far fetched but, that was just my opinion.  On the whole, it was a very interesting and thoroughly enjoyable movie.

The post mistress, Dorcas Lane is more or less the main character. She is single, attractive and very opinionated, she does not hesitate speaking her mind, even though there are times it is not wanted or welcomed. Laura, the young girl that comes to live and work at the post office is cousin to Dorcas. She is just precious, although a typical young girl she is very responsible and level headed for one so young. Thomas, the mail carrier, Queenie, better known as the bee keeper and her husband Twister are all three excellent in their rolls.  There is humor, happiness, seriousness, love and sadness.  All well carried out throughout the movie.

If you enjoy English movies, this is definitely a must have.",1304121600,4,1172,4.521327014218009
4395457,2,B004K4FUUC,"It was a disappointment. Brendan Coyle, Laura's father, left the cast in the previous season, presumably for his role in Downton Abbey. His leaving could have been handled a little differently or at least adequately addressed in this season. That created a glaring hole in the storyline, for me.  Everything seemed rushed, condensed to the point of absurdity. There were far fewer episodes.  Things about the characters that seemed like little flaws were suddenly magnified. Julia Sawalhas smirks and expressions really started to get on my nerves and I found myself wanting to throw an imaginary cream pie at her. Don't get me wrong, I admire her as an actress! The young woman who played Laura, while enchanting in so many ways, had the annoying habit of moving her head a lot every time she spoke. I guess because the stories, for me, weren't as good as the other seasons, some of the characters seemed more like caricatures of their former selves, I started focusing on these things instead. Dawn French's coming back was nice. I'll miss the two sisters, and especially Queenie and her husband. Wish things could have been different with this season: more story, less feeling like it was a rushed and careless ending to what had been an enjoyable, gentle romp through time.",1304121600,54,1277,4.880184331797235

Was very disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!

4395459,3,B004K4FUUC,"I have been obsessed with the previous seasons of LRTC as they have so successfully presented the themes of change and community ethics at the turn of the nineteenth century.  The fourth season has been a disappointment in the high standards that the other seasons set.  Unlike those successful portrayals, this season tells the stories without the interconnectedness of the people of the two communities and the elemental layering of meaning.  The folks who constructed the original series 1-3 were masterful in drawing the events and perceptions of the characters together to ""teach"" (what an outmoded notion)ethical lessons.  In those plots the characters grew in their humanity.  Season four was written as though it were fulfilling a contractual obligation.  That said, the charm of the two communities still had greater appeal than 99.9% of what is fictionalized on American TV.",1303689600,3,884,5.2785714285714285

Definitely, buy the whole series!  I am deeply disappointed and puzzled by it's early demise.  Surely there was a wealth of plotlines yet to be used.  If you're listening BBC, we want this one BACK!!!!!",1303603200,5,458,5.121621621621622
4395461,5,B004K4FUUC,"I LOVE this series.  The stories are endearing and the characters are so true to life. I feel like I am related to them.  They aren't perfect, and the writing is based on this fact...everyone working out their personal imperfections, and seeing the good in others rather than dwelling on their weaknesses.  If only we could all be as wise, and sweetly humble as Dorcus Lane, she is my one weakness.

I did miss Brendan Coyle this season as Robert Timmins (no doubt busy filming Downton Abbey), and I was neither happy nor sad to see that the stories branched out more from whom it used to be mainly focused upon...Olivia Hallinan as Laura Timmins.  I was SO EXTREMELY HAPPY to see Dawn French return as Caroline Arless, she is a joy to watch.  I hope she sticks around...on the show, and on the show.

Very well done, and I hope there will be more seasons to come!  These people are beloved family.",1302912000,,898,4.466257668711656

4395465,1,B004K4FUUC,"I can see why there will be no season 5. Season 4 was a rush job, they tried to tie the ends all in one episode and it ruined the final season. Dorcas married the last man standing(he never smiles), Mini married Alfie after his mother returns from prison & has an overnight epiphany on how to be a good/reformed mom, Laura & Daniel discuss Laura's writing ability & not much else. And Twister wasn't even in the last episode, nor was Mr. Timmons who not was even in season 4. Guess he was too busy with Downton Abby. They might have just as well had stopped with season 3. I guess this is why they lowered the price. So very disappointed.",1302220800,12,638,4.237704918032787
4395466,5,B004K4FUUC,"Not for cynics, this gloriously sentimental view on life in small-town/village England at the end of the 19th century is superbly written, directed and acted.  It's certainly easy enough to condemn non-gritty reality, but this series has been -- and continues to be -- at the top of its game.  Beginning with actors such as Julia Sawalha, Linda Bassett, Kurt Johnson and Claudie Blakley and such fine directors as Sue Tully and Patrick Lau, the individual stories which comprise the overview of these two small communities make for the kind of drama that cannot help but be compelling.  Missing however -- probably because he was shooting BBC's other great show, DOWNTON ABBEY -- is Brendon Coyle.  It is rare to find such excellence anywhere on the tube, so invest in the four seasons of LARK RISE TO CANDLEFORD.",1302134400,,813,4.869565217391305

4395468,4,B004K4FUUC,"Season 4 is the final season. There are six episodes only and the fact that they are rushing to a conclusion means that they are not as good as the previous 3 seasons. Still quite entertaining but you get the feeling that things are winding down. The final episode rushes along in order to make sure that all of the loose ends are tidied up. Contrary to the blurb, Brendan Coyle does not appear in this season. Be prepared to feel disappointed. The high production standard is generally maintained but the writer and director were hamstrung by the BBCs desire to dump the show as soon as possible. Quite why the Beeb took the unusual step to dump a show which has had very good viewing figures for these series is beyond me. Because of the hurried ending I have awarded 4 stars which is a pity because I have really enjoyed watching this programme. It has been my one weakness.,",1298764800,394,878,4.459627329192546

I bought all the avalible seasons of it and hope somehow someway they continue to make more like it.

8432369,4,B004K4FUUC,"Like many others, I did enjoy this series, enough to watch all four seasons, and rather obsessively. It made me want to find out what was going to happen next in the lives of the characters. However, another reason I wanted to find out what was going to happen (that was probably unintended) was that practically every single episode had some kind of strange curveball that came out of nowhere that the characters seemingly accepted without question, and the viewer was supposed to, too--and which never got resolved, or discussed, or even continued in another episode. Another reviewer here noted the lack of consistency, and this contributes to that feeling.

For example, in season three (this is a spoiler alert, though only for one episode), a seamstress comes to town and is hired by Pearl, and they become best buddies until--she turns out to be some kind of liberal feminist wacko who wants to dress in men's clothing (their idea of a wacko, anyway)! Where did that come from??? She eventually leaves for a more legitimate reason, and the incident is never referred to again, and once again we are left with a lot of questions that never get answered. This is far from the only example of strange, confusing, odd and completely unexplained turns in the storyline of each episode.

I do want to repeat, however, that this is a delightful series and I really enjoyed watching it, even if it often left me shaking my head at its oddball twists and turns. At least you could say it wasn't predictable!",1526688000,,1505,4.740458015267175

8432373,5,B004K4FUUC,"A wonderful series! It was too bad that it ended so abruptly, and even in a short season at that. The characters in this series were well developed and interesting; it would have been nice to see them go on. The one character I found a bit bland was Laura, ironically the pivotal character for the series. She changes very little once she makes the initial adjustment to Candleford. It's too bad the story ends just as Dorcas gets to break out of her secure life and make a change for love. The rest of the story would have been very good material, especially with Minnie and Alf marrying, and progress bringing change to the way of life. I think the BBC missed a chance with this one!",1525824000,,685,4.359375
