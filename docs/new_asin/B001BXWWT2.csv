8285242,5,B001BXWWT2,We had worked in the San Joaquin Valley of California running programs to help Mexican-American farm workers and moved to DC to work for an international self-help housing program. Shortly after our move to DC we attended the Mobilization to End the War in Vietnam. There was such a large crowd that it was difficult to tell what was happening. One thing was clear: the police and military were attacking the anti-war protesters and many were seriously injured. It was a frightening experience. The Chris Marker film does a good job of capturing the actions of the protesters on both sides.,1368662400,5,590,4.851485148514851
