Sick Girl runs along the I am a distrurbing type of movie rather than a scary one.  So no out of the our seat jumps here.  There are also some good laughs along the way but this is by no means a horror comedy.  For its budget (not much) it worked well with they could do.  Gory scenes are not cheezy effects but rather look honest and believable.

Be prepared to listen intently.  The sound is horrible.  You can barely make out what they are saying and the sound effects and music are overly loud.

3883095,4,B002A00IXW,"Imagine sitting through the most gloriously depraved mutilation/rape scene you've ever seen - I won't give away the gory details here, but I honestly think it may have outdone anything to be found in ""Der Todesking.""  Not the most disturbing rape scene, per say - it's going to take a filmmaker with a LOT of balls to take that title from ""Irreversible"" - but just the most deliciously conceived and executed trasho-horror exploitation ever.  Now imagine that scene set to ""Mr. Blue Sky"" by ELO - such genius would be cause to throw up your hands in thunderous applause!  Which I did.

This scene is one of many gems to be found in ""Sick Girl,"" writer-director Eben McGarr's smart, sick, and shockingly good independent horror film, which will be released on DVD August 25.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sick-Girl-Special-Edition-DVD/dp/B002A00IXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sick Girl (Special Edition DVD)</a>&nbsp;(...and no, it's not ""Mr. Blue Sky,"" but it may as well be - Aaron Moreland and Dennis Haggerty's ""Familiy Tree"" is as perfect a throwback to such 70's vocodered summer-fun-in-the-sun classics as one could hope to find).  Smarter than your average slasher film, it's the story of Izzy, a somewhat unhinged teenage girl who spends her time slitting throats, splitting heads, and doing unspeakable things to nuns.  She also has three victims tied up in her barn, who she occasionally visits to dole out increasingly sadistic acts of mutilation.

That said, where the film transcends is that it also displays, and really centers on, another side of Izzy - a teenage girl who has been forced to raise her little brother Kevin on her own when their big brother is sent to Iraq.  We see that Izzy cares deeply for her little brother, and feels affection and appreciation for kind neighbor Barney (played by McGarr's brother John) who consistently steps in to help raise Kevin.  I always love movies that present psychos with their own sense of code: it is a credit to McGarr that Izzy does not kill a kindly stranger who comes to her aide halfway through the film, nor that she senselessly kills a rat that comes into her possession.  In the hands of a lesser director these would have simply called for more scenes of carnage - despite the bloodbath this girl unleashes, she comes to have a ""character,"" and it's in keeping with her character that she does, or does not do, the things she does throughout the film.  That's very impressive for a film which contains a graphic dismemberment.

Credit is also due to actress Leslie Andrews - she gives Sleepaway Camp's Pamela Springsteen a run for her money as cinema's most convincingly cheeky slasher girl.  There are so many scenes which have an impact that hinge on her performance, and she nails it every time.  In one scene in particular, when she makes full advantage of a young bully's developing sociopathy, it is her control and her understanding of character that keeps the scene from being at all campy - it's an effective and chilling scene, and one of true horror that, at least for me, was totally believable despite its extreme grimness.  That she doesn't then set the boy loose to continue down his path is, again, a credit to the filmmakers - she knows that kid is sick, and she uses it to her advantage, but that kid's not going anywhere.  He's a bully - bully's are ""bad.""  Again, without the right performance, such nuances in ""code"" are lost on villains - it's why we're able to quietly feel for Henry in ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer,"" and why by the end of ""Sick Girl,"" we kind of don't want to see anything bad happen to Izzy.

There's a humorous subplot in the film involving Kevin's teacher, Mr. Putski, and his missing rat (I can't remember the rat's name right now, but it gave me a chuckle).  I am glad for this subplot, if for no other reason that it brought back to horror cinema one of its lost sons, ""Fright Night's"" Stephen Geoffreys, as the teacher.  It was essentially a cameo role, but it was good to see ol' Evil Ed again.  And again, it lent for another great character moment - Izzy, despite her brutality, rescues and returns Mr. Putski's rat.  How can you hate someone that returns someone's beloved rat?

I really love this movie, and am glad that McGarr is giving a fresh new voice to horror - I look forward with great anticipation to see what he does next.

3883098,3,B002A00IXW,"Sick Girl (Eben McGarr, 2007)

I actually grabbed this sight unseen looking for the Masters of Horror episode directed by Lucky McKee, so what I actually got was something of a surprise. A pleasant one, but a surprise nonetheless. Not a bad little film at all, though rumors of its extremity have, in my estimation, been somewhat exaggerated. That's made up for by a compelling, if at times confusing, story and some solid characters.

Plot: Izzy (Actors' Leslie Andrews), the title character, is a lovely young thing who went nuts when her older brother went off to join the military. Her younger brother is getting bullied at school, so Izzy (after an opening scene that, as far as I could tell, connects to nothing else and is just there for the shock value) kidnaps the three bullies and forces them to turn against one another. The top dog ends up shackled in Izzy's barn along with a poor, innocent couple who honestly don't deserve what's coming to them. Really. It's not nice.

If you're looking for flat-out extremity, there are a few movies that should be in the queue before this, but not all that many. Still, while it holds up relatively well against both genre classics like The Devil's Experiment and new flicks like Philosophy of a Knife alike, it never really pushes any more gory envelopes than filmmakers like Brian Paulin (Fetus) or Ron DeCaro (The Gateway Meat) are pushing; if you've seen those and had no problems holding onto your dinner, this one probably won't bug you much, either. The difference is that most gore films that go for extremity are low-budget, badly-acted messes with little attention paid to the characters. Sick Girl resembles the genre's more nuanced movies (Deadgirl being an obvious example) in that McGarr, while writing the screenplay, obviously thought about Izzy far more than most gore filmmakers think about their main characters, and had enough talent to transfer a lot of what he was thinking to the page without making it overly obvious that that's what he was doing. Izzy, then, becomes a well-rounded and intriguing character for this sort of film. There are some times when Andrews' acting isn't quite up to the task--she's much better at running around chopping folks up than she is at emoting--but she's good enough for most of the movie to pull this off. Many of the minor characters are neither as well-acted nor as fleshed out (the main bully being the exception), so this becomes a movie driven solely by Izzy's character and the gore. It almost works. Any number of things could have been done to push it that last bit over the edge, but none of them actually happened; that is often the case with basement-budget features, and you really can't blame anyone for lack of cashflow. Eben McGarr did the best he could with what he had, and while it is very much a vertical-market film for the gorehounds in the audience, it does what it does well enough to get a recommendation from yours truly. ***",1260489600,3,2961,4.756809338521401
3883099,5,B002A00IXW,"Let's cut to the chase. The creator-provided synopsis goes, ""A girl who wants to protect her little brother, f___ her older brother and torture everyone else out in the barn."" Any questions? Well, while undeniably accurate, the film isn't quite as simplistic as this would suggest. Izzy (Andrews) is left to bring up her young brother (Trepany) after her older sibling heads off to Iraq with the Marines - both parents are absent, and the reasons for this are, interestingly, never made entirely clear, though we have some evidence for Izzy's involvement. The only one who helps out is Barney (McGarr) a biker who plays Santa Claus at the local hospital, but it's soon made clear that Izzy is entirely capable of fending for herself. Especially when a proto-thug at the local school decides to pick on her kid bro.

Izzy is an intriguing mix, a character somewhere between Juno and Dexter; to those she loves, she is fiercely loyal, yet anyone else had best not cross her, or the results will be horrific, in ways beyond your imagination [certainly, at least one sequence goes well beyond our imagination!] I think it's her sheer cold-blooded approach that is the most chilling thing here, and Andrews is simply phenomenal in the role, possessing a calmness which is completely unnerving. Even when engaging in brutality of the most appalling sort, you suspect her heart-beat rarely goes above 85. She even takes time out to lecture small children on the evils of bullying, where her philosophy is, ""There's nothing wrong with hurting things smaller than you - providing you also take on things bigger than you. Then size is irrelevant."" Cold: very cold. If you want to peer into the abyss which is the very darkest corner of the human psyche, then this is low-budget cinema at its brilliant best. However, you should be aware that you might see things you will not easily forget.",1260057600,6,1880,4.838509316770186

This movie is not for everyone. I was not expecting much when I rented this on Netflix, but I was pleasantly or unpleasantly surprized. This movie was not made on a big budget, hence the reason I wanted to watch it in the first place. The acting is really good and sometimes believing (some actors in this flick are just horrible).

3883101,2,B002A00IXW,"There is a new subtype of film that has emerged within the last half decade or so that exists almost solely within the horror movie genre. These films are based around one, or both of the the two main stays of the exploitation diet, sex and violence. Some examples of this new subtype include Gutterballs, The Hood Has Eyes, Defenceless, Baise Moi, and Blood and Sex Nightmare. Possibly an off shoot of the slightly less recent Torture Porn horror subgenre, this new subtype takes things one step further, and dares to do that which the big studios are afraid to do. Though I do respect the overall gist of their approach, and have absolutely no problem with extreme offensive underground cinema that dares to flip the bird at the Hollywood system, and doesn't mind going straight to DVD, the problem is that the majority of these films are technically not any good. They all suffer in one way or another from bad lighting, inconsistant audio, poor visual quality, horrible acting, shabby directing, and terrible scripts. Sure, most of them contain all the sex and adult oriented debauchery that anyone could ever want within an exploitative sleaze fest, yet, usually there is zero subtlety and nuance to make all this depravity anyway seductive or emotionally compelling. One can argue that subtlety should not be sought after in such low brow mindless entertainment, but I feel that without a decent understanding or use of these subtext, that any film, no matter what the subject matter may be, ultimately becomes boring. All the naked bodies and splatter by themselves does not make up for a film that doesn't know how to use them properly.

Silence is Golden.

What seperates Sick Girl from its contemporaries is that it actually tries to have real characters and deeper meaning by attempting some sibilance of a drama. This means one of two things. First and foremost, the level of gratuitous sex, and scantly clad women, is greatly reduced when compaired to other films in its subgenre. The only sexual scene that does take place is near the end of the picture, and is only there for shock value purposes. It involves Sick Girl cutting the genitals off of one of her captured male victims and making a strap on out of it by attatching it to what appears to be a railroad spike stuck through a piece of wood. She then proceeds to rape one of her tied up captured female victims with this crude home made device. More quirky then horrific in its exicution, the graphic scene is set up like a kind of clumsy music video with a shrilly recorded annoying buble gum pop song as its main soundtrack. Outside of this, most of the film consists of dialogue, lots and lots of dialogue, and sadly, most of it is painfully embarrassing to sit through. The plot, if you want to call it such, is really just a facade to bolster and explain Sick Girls super tough image and awesome killing abilities, while at the same time working as a superficial excuse for further scenes of graphic blood shed. Sick Girl is really just another film about one of those walking human death machines, you know the type that are mostly nomadic in their romantically self induced isolation? Sick Girl is a kind of modern Spaghetti Western- Shaw Brothers action hero, who is so otherworldly skilled and tough, that she might as well be of supernatural origin. This is by no means an original premise for a film, and it has been one that has worked to great effect many times in the past. The problem here is that everyone involved in this film is too amateurish to pull off this idea effectively. There are many one sided conversations throughout Sick Girl, in which she explains her views to one of her many subdued and gagged victims, but these moments go over like a ton of bricks. That is because they where designed to be powerfully moving important speeches, but are instead delivered with inept wooden acting, and self consciously stilted dialogue. It is almost as if writer and director Eban McGarr didn't receive his own memo explaining what kind of movie Sick Girl was suppose to be. If all these attempts proved one thing, it is that this really is a film made by laymen.

Death on Two Legs.

If there is a saving grace to this film, it was likely accidental rather then conceptual. Usually a film like Sick Girl would use that old time tested revenge outline, in which the victim of a horrible crime rights the injustices done to them by going on a killing spree. What makes Sick Girl so different, is that she is not a victim of anything more then mere annoyances. The people she tortures and kills, are not really harming anyone in any serious way, they are just being jerks. It is here that Sick Girl managed to inadvertantly tap into something that could of really made for an outstanding cinema experience. Lets face it, people can really be lame. We have all had those moments in which we where so perturbed, that we secretly wish that the object of or anger would spontaneously combust or get struck by a falling safe or lightning bolt. Each of us also share that same retained mixture of rage and regret from the many bad experiences in our pasts with either bullies or authority figures. Though I don't think that Eban McGarr really hit on the potential of this idea, or even really realized what he was getting into, Sick Girl almost works as a sort of guilty pleasure in which the people that most upset us in our daily lives, get dealt the ultimate karmic justice. Despite all the hope I had when I bought this film, or how badly I wanted to like it, I just couldn't muster anything within myself to make up for Sick Girls many tedious pit falls. The worst of which being a script full of incredably horrible dialogue. It was a nice try, I give him that, but the best I can do is give all those involved in this project an E for effort, not my recommendations.",1257897600,2,5857,4.596558317399618

3883105,2,B002A00IXW,"This movie looked interesting in that it was an independent production and the storyline looked decent enough. I checked it out  and I was wrong. Pretty far wrong at that.

The lead character, Izzy, has gone off the deep end. It seems she got this way when she learned of her brother's death in Iraq. (at least this is about all we're given as evidence). She is so screwed up she waaaayyyy overreacts to things. I won't recount the plot as others have already done so. We know that people snap. We read it in the news on a regular basis, but I simply didn't believe it here. Maybe it's because the horrible acts she performs are prolonged. In some cases they take days and she is able to hide the fact from the people around her and still maintain a logic (a clever logic at that) to justify what she does. She even waxes philosophic during one scene. These atrocities then go well beyond the realm of ""crimes of passion.""

As for the nuts and bolts of the movie: There are some real problems there as well. Yes it is low budget but that sort of thing only bothers me when it is accompanied by lousy acting and directing as is the case here. It also fails at the script/dialogue level. Whenever there was prolonged dialogue going on I got the impression I was listening to the writer and not the characters. Maybe it was due to the writing, but maybe it was due to the actors doing a poor job delivering their lines.

All that being said you would do better by seeing a movie like ""The Girl Next Door"" which deals in the same madness but gives the viewer far greater believability.",1255910400,5,1581,4.349152542372881

Her motivations are revealed at the very end of the film... but until that point, the movie seems to be quite pointless. Essentially we're shown a bunch of abduction and torture scenes. The movie tries to win viewers over with shock value. However, fans of the ""torture porn"" genre will probably find Sick Girl's violence and gore to be rather tame and uninspired. For example, there's a sexual assault scene that's so unrealistic (and acted so poorly) that it has zero emotional weight. It's more pathetic than traumatizing. In addition to these issues, Sick Girl has an extremely low budget (and it shows!). I can't recommend this movie to anyone for any possible reason.

The film pushes things to the edge. In this feature children are tortured and killed. A nun is urinated on. And people in general are tortured and killed with a graphic manhood removal scene. The arm breaking scene made me cringe.

Izzy is clearly psychotic. Her quiet mousey way is entertaining.

The extra features included a public service announcement that I loved. It was pretty funny.  There is also some biographical material about Leslie Andrews who grew up taking bloody, dead photos of herself.  Not for everyone film, just those with a sick sense of humor.
