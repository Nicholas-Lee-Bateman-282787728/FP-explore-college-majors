3959224,5,B002NALPHW,Four good vampire movies for a nice price I had to get this I like this collection alot and plan on keeping it.,1354752000,,111,3.869565217391304
3959225,4,B002NALPHW,"I got this DVD to upgrade my old VHS copy of Nadja, a very slow and offbeat vampire classic from 1994. With grainy B&W photography that sometimes lapses deliberately into a pixilated look, you have to be in a patient and artsy mood to get into this. But the acting by Elina Lwensohn and Peter Fonda as descendants of Dracula and Van Helsing is strong, and the mood is conveyed successfully despite a low budget. The same cannot be said for the other three movies on the disc; Undead Express and Vampire Wars are unwatchably amateurish, and The Case of the Whitechapel Vampire, while well photographed, does too much violence to the character of Sherlock Holmes to be bearable either. Still, one out of four isn't a bad batting average for this low price.",1347840000,3,754,4.634328358208955
3959226,2,B002NALPHW,"I bought this because it was on super sale and basically rounded out free shipping.

Effectively it was ""free"" and that made it easily worthwhile. Had I paid for it, my view may well have been different - very different.

The case of the Whitechapel Vampire was actually quite good - it was surprising to discover a reasonable quality Sherlock Holmes tale in the mix, and overall I must admit I quite enjoyed it.

Nadja was a black and white affair, it was rather esoteric for my tastes but I could understand others giving it something of a cult status. I skipped past it after it failed to hold my interest some 20 minutes in.

Vampire Wars was something I just couldn't put any credibility to, the sets, the costumes, the storylines and the actings I personally felt were at best junior college type productions - the special effects were worse. I rarely get very negative about purchases but this one is more likely to leave the watcher dead bored than undead thrilled.

The Undead Express was not as good for me as Whitechapel, but significantly ahead of the others as it investigated potential psychoses in youth rather than what the movie aimed to portray as the true underlying causes of the childs issues. Plausible storyline with decent acting.

Two out of four for free on a single double sided disc.

If you're really into this genere, you may well get substantially more from the quartet than I did - if it's just a passing thought of purchase there may be other choices available.",1330300800,,1494,4.636363636363637

8374947,5,B002NALPHW,I only bought this because I wanted The Undead Express which I watched when I was little! I grew up loving vampire movies. It arrived today and it brings back so many memories!,1524096000,,176,4.363636363636363

8374952,5,B002NALPHW,My husband loves these kinds of movies so he's begging me to buy more,1456790400,,69,4.0
8374953,1,B002NALPHW,"Four attempts to make films of the vampire genre into art turns out to be tacky, tasteless messes. Especially ""Nadia,"" an awful remake of ""Dracula's Daughter,"" which made me wonder why they bothered. It was overlong and boring. Even the hints of lesbianism didn't liven anything up.
The other three were your standard ""creepy type"" films that would never make it into any theatre, but populate the commercial ridden horror channels on cable tv.
As I understand it, some of them made it into ""cult classic"" status, though I could not understand how or why.
They are not funny; they are not scary; none of the characters deserved any sympathy.
These dogs can easily put someone to sleep while watching them.
Fortunately, the collection was dirt cheap, so I wasn't too put out of pocket.",1428105600,,784,4.814814814814815
8374954,4,B002NALPHW,"Three of the movies in this Collector's set were truly stunning and can easily be recommended and one was a total failure. The movies I liked were The Undead Express, Vampire Wars and the Case of the Whitechapel Vampire. They were just the kind of vampire movies I'm looking for. Bloody, scary, good acting and great specialeffects. And I also liked the fact that they followed the rules what vampires can and cannot do. The one I didn't like was Nadja. I'm not a fan of David Lynch and the movie was so boring that I had to stop the DVD after just 20 minutes. But this vampire box is still a bargain and three of the movies are well worth the money that you pay for this product.",1377648000,2,680,4.27906976744186
8374955,3,B002NALPHW,I enjoyed some of these movies but a couple was out there. Joe Lando makes a great vampire as well as Peter Fonda was great.,1374451200,,124,4.0
8374956,5,B002NALPHW,The other 3 films are trash but Nadja is a fantastic slow burn vampire film that any fan of the fanged should own and it is way cheaper to buy this combo pack then Nadja by itself.,1366416000,,180,3.891891891891892
