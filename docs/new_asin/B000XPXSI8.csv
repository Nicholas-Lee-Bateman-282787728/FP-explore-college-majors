8229051,2,B000XPXSI8,"""Ballad of a Colt,"" all nine minutes and twenty-two seconds of it, is the true account of a colt that slipped down a steep slope away from its mother. Yavor Nedelchev, credited as director, writer, producer, star, and a few other things, climbed down, camera in hand, to try to rescue the colt while others led the mother along a long route to the colt. (The idea is that the colt would not move without its mother to lead the way.)

There is no great drama here. We do not see the colt's fall but instead see the small, obviously frightened horse standing uncomfortably at the base of the slope after the fall. Eventually, the mare makes it to the colt, and the pair of horses is led away with relative ease along a road.

What sinks the film for me is a combination of factors. First, the director presents this film as a moral tale about the importance of positive thinking. Second, he frequently cuts back to shots of himself as he narrates the tale, casting himself in the leading role of the rescue. As far as I can tell, though, he did little more than climb down the hill and film the frightened colt. There is also the music, little more than a loud, incessant drum beat. (The subtitles are also rather poor attempts at English. You get the idea most of the time, but they clearly are not the product of a native English speaker.)

In the end, I found the film did not do anything to elevate itself above the animal-in-peril segments one often sees on television. Still, the colt is cute.",1196899200,,1497,4.416666666666667
