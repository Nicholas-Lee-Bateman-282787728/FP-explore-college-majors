8721036,4,B00ZVSH2SO,"I have 5 other versions of Ma Vlast*, but opted for this DVD because the prospect of actually watching it performed in Smetana Hall during a recent Prague Spring Festival was too good to pass up. Plus, it featured not only the Czech Philharmonic on ""home turf"", but also their late music director Jiri Belohlavek, who died in May, 2017.

This is a beautiful rendition, and being able to see it in this historic hall was quite emotional. Also, I think you really can learn something extra about how pieces like these are scored and written if the DVD contains astute, modern camera work to highlight some aspects of the performance that may not always be evident in the sound picture of a CD alone. And this one does.

I believe this is the same 2014 performance (or set of performances) that were more recently issued on CD by Decca. Belohlavek shapes the cycle beautifully, and builds up the intensity and level of emotion as the cycle progresses. Tabor is tremendous, and Blanik, the last tone poem, really shines out in culmination. There are other performances that cast some of the individual tone poems in brighter primary colours than here; for example, I agree with Gramophone that the conclusion of Sarka could be more energized and played with more fire. But that's more of a nit. This piece runs over 75 minutes in its entirety, and if you want a more cohesive whole instead of just a chain of rousing tone poems....decisions probably need to be made. And this is a very satisfying whole.

The sound quality is very good, although not as crystal clear as the more recent CD. This is something I'll keep coming back to.

*others I have: Talich, 1939; Talich, 1954; Ancerl 1964 (all these on Supraphon); Kubelik, 1988 (Orfeo); Kubelik 1990 (Supraphon). All of these are special in their own way.",1527984000,,1804,4.699367088607595

8721038,5,B00ZVSH2SO,"This recording by Belohlavek from the 2014 Prague Spring Festival neatly replaces his earlier recording made in 2011 at the same venue, the Smetana Hall in Prague, but with the students of the Conservatoire. That was much admired but this recording trumps the earlier one in two important respects - it offers surround sound in addition to the stereo available on the earlier recording and, importantly, it features the Czech Philharmonic instead of the excellent student body of the earlier disc.

The Czech Philharmonic play all six of the tone poems that make up Ma Vlast as to the manner born and their identification with the music is one of total and convincing empathy. Belohlavek favours a cohesive approach to the orchestration so there is musical gain with the more bombastic poems. The orchestra is significantly enlarged and viewers may find it interesting to note the extra players involved. The woodwind are doubled from two to four players per part, the horns become six instead of four and the harps number six which might be necessitated by their position of the stage behind the strings. The extra players only play at climatic moments and are balanced throughout the orchestra so that the orchestral sound is not really affected. The other instruments of the orchestra are increased to compensate with the exception of the percussion - with the one triangle still able to be heard!

This appears to be a HD recording made for TV and offers crisp imaging if not quite matching the increased definition of a Bluray presentation. The sound is clear and well-balanced throughout and that is a fine achievement given the construction of the historic venue which obviously was not designed with acoustics in mind. There are apparently no plans to issue this recording in Bluray format in the future so there would be no point in waiting for that eventuality.

This very nationalistic music is here given an idiomatic performance by the leading national orchestra who will have played the music countless times. The same identification with the music applies to the conductor and the whole experience of this 'live' concert is greeted with rapt attention by the packed audience.

This disc from 2014 is an obvious contender for intending purchasers of Ma Vlast and neatly updates Belohlavek's earlier stereo 2011 DVD.",1444435200,6,2329,5.025906735751295
