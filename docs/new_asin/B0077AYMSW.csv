8511604,3,B0077AYMSW,"I read the reviews and purchased it anyway.  They were right, it is an okay effort, but I was hoping for more details.  I did learn something in spite of myself.",1464307200,,161,4.161290322580645
8511605,2,B0077AYMSW,"Lovely -- if you want to see islands only from the air. A bit boring without a few people and some of the landscape visible from on the land itself. I sold the DVD for one dollar, and felt lucky to get that.",1449014400,,207,3.8372093023255816
8511606,5,B0077AYMSW,Breathtaking journey. Worth repeating.,1435622400,,38,8.75
8511607,5,B0077AYMSW,Aerial views and nice narratives in the local accent. Plus you learn how to pronounce the names of the islands featured.,1390348800,,120,4.761904761904762
8511608,5,B0077AYMSW,Excellent view of the Islands I have personally seen (does make me a bit homesick) and leaves me with the desire to see the rest of the Islands.  Very well done!,1388448000,,161,4.193548387096774
8511609,5,B0077AYMSW,"I absolutely love these DVDs.  They perfectly capture the wild beauty and incredible colors of Scotland.  I enjoy watching them and reminiscing about the scrambling I did in some of the areas pictured.  When I miss the highlands, I watch these DVDs.  The music is a little hokey, but after awhile I got used to it.  Everything fades away in the beauty of these islands.",1387843200,,369,4.615384615384615
8511610,4,B0077AYMSW,"Firstly not sure if I am reviewing same programme as mine is Islands of Scotland, and is 6 part production covering the same islands as Scotland Islands ~ packaging is also different.
The previous two reviewers ~ almost put me off purchasing this DVD collection but I am so pleased I ignored their comments and made the purchase.
Yes ~ its a birds eye view of the islands ~ and the scenery is magnificent ~ there are so many islands to observe ~ it would be impossible to view so many islands ~ if commentator gave more specific details of each island. The commentary is interesting and informative ~ in history and culture of the islands. The soundtrack ~ although not Scottish, is soothing and relaxing ~ and I have enjoyed and savoured every last minute of the programme.
My only disappointment is that my home island of Bute is not featured ~ but then perhaps another programme covers the Clyde coast islands.
In my opinion ~ its an excellent DVD and would recommend others to purchase.",1372550400,4,990,4.598870056497175
8511611,1,B0077AYMSW,"This 2 DVD set is about 150 minutes long. It includes; Isle of Skye & The Small Isles, Orkney Islands, Islay, Jura, Colonsay & Gigha, Shetland Islands, Mull,Coll,Iona &Tiree and the Western Isles. There are no extras or subtitles. Sometimes the subtitles would have come in handy, because at points it is hard to understand the narrator, especially as he is pronouncing place names. Maps are only shown for an instant, which does not help in a viewer's understanding. The music in the background could have been more suitable for Scotland. At times it is thumping with drums and beats in the background that does not lend any atmosphere.

There are many occasions spent flying through the clouds, more time is spent looking at clouds than one is allowed to look at the sights. Even then, buildings and towns buzz by and the aerial view is so high up that the few people you can see look as large as ants and even large ships and manor houses and castles appear as toys and doll houses. There is a cliffside road where we are told drivers need to keep their attention for any danger, but we are again at such a height; it looks like a mere garden footpath.

I love Scotland and one just longs to see the real beauty of it. You cannot get an appreciation for its majesty from hundreds of feet in the air. This DVD is a disservice to a beautiful and magnificent country.",1359936000,10,1367,4.485943775100401
8511612,1,B0077AYMSW,"Scenic view taken from (perhaps) a helicopter, and a voice-over -THAT'S IT!

The scenery is stunning, but the way it get presented will make you feel as if
you had watched the whole DVD after only watching for 3 MINUTES (Yes, I feel that it's even less than 5 minutes!).
For the audience to know the islands more instead of only a vague impression on the views presented,
they should provide supplement info and more DESIGN.
No captions is a critical drawback since the narrator has some accent.
and everything is displayed in SMALL sizes.

In sum, I wouldn't recommend for collection.
It's perhaps nice to check it out from a library, though you are fine if you don't.",1359072000,4,669,4.61344537815126
