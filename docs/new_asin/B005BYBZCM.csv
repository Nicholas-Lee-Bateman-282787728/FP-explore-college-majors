4650287,5,B005BYBZCM,"This DVD is a must have for any long time wrestling fan. I've been watching wrestling since I've been 2 years old (1985) and its crazy to have been a fan through all of this and then sit down and watch this DVD. You can tell that Bret Hart is definately the more sincere individual in this DVD. Might be the best documentary dvd the WWE has ever put out. I know some people don't like the fact the some of the matches have already been released on DVD but if you want a definative Bret/Shawn dvd you have to include their most memorable matches. The only matches that haven't been released on DVD are Hart Foundation vs. Rockers in Japan, The ladder match (which I had on VHS),The match from wrestling challenge in 1990, and the IC title match from April 1992. I wish this would have been a 4 disc set with more matches (some of my favs are Macho/Hitman vs. Flair/Shawn, Survivor Series 97, and some more of the Foundation vs Rocker matches, maybe some bouts from 94 aswell)",1319587200,,974,4.357142857142857
4650288,5,B005BYBZCM,"First, this DVD release will end up probably being hated by a vast majority of wrestling fans that view it. Why? Because it shatters several myths that wrestling fans have enjoyed discussing for years. Things that fans have believed and thought were real are denounced by both men in the interview. So, if you prefer to hold onto the myths and legends surrounding these two, you may want to actually skip this release. With that said, this is easily one of WWE's best DVD releases ever. It's right up there with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-ECW/dp/B0001Y4LZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rise and Fall of ECW</a>&nbsp;and for many will surpass it. This set is all about the lengthy sit down interview between the two men. It's not all about Montreal, and Jim Ross (the host) stresses that both men's careers weren't defined by that one night, it's a discussion on how both men came up in the wrestling business, first as friends, then bitter rivals and how they managed to make peace in the end. You'll hear both men talk about their tag team careers and what they thought of one another early on. You'll hear how excited Shawn was to see Bret become champion because he viewed that as Bret paving the way for him to achieve the same goal. You'll hear Bret discuss how he admired Shawn Michael's wrestling ability and would go to bat for him several times to Vince McMahon. You'll also hear how the seeds were planted for their rivalry, which was a work in the beginning, but became legitimate hatred later on. Both men get emotional, numerous times, during this interview. As a fan of both, it's hard not to get choked up right along with them as they relive the most emotional parts of their careers. They speak from the heart and hold nothing back. I've seen every WWE DVD documentary released and this one will move you, especially if you've followed both men's entire careers like I have. Many stories and myths about their rivalry and hatred for one another are squashed by both men, which I still believe will upset a lot of fans. I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't give away the meat of what was discussed in the interview, I'll just leave it at that. Just know that many of the cool stories and conspiracy theories people, and wrestling journalists have talked about for years, will be proven to be just that... stories and conspiracy theories.

As for the matches, there's nothing here we haven't really seen before, with one exception. They included a rare steel cage match from these two that you won't find on any other DVD, so it's cool to see it here. The infamous Survivor Series match is not included on this DVD set, but instead is an exclusive bonus match on the Blu-ray edition:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-Shawn-Michaels-vs-Bret-Hart-WWE-s-Greatest-Rivalries-2-Disc-Blu-ray/dp/B005BYBZBS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE Shawn Michaels vs. Bret Hart: WWE's Greatest Rivalries 2-Disc Blu-ray</a>.

Needles to say, this is a must buy for any fan of Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels. It's a tremendous look back on two of the most important careers in wrestling history. Their discussion is an unfiltered look at what made them great and clears the air on the more controversial parts of their legendary careers.",1319500800,24,3352,5.148623853211009
4650289,5,B005BYBZCM,"I'm going to try to keep this brief, as I could probably write thousands of words about this.  I am only going to review the portion where the two legends sit with Jim Ross for a face to face.  These two guys, sitting next to each other, looking older... truly surreal.  Bret's honesty during this and his emotion is beyond moving.  All of the stories that he told in his book that sounded suspicious have all but been confirmed here.  He puts it all out there for everyone to see.  Shawn says things of self awareness that his 1998 self probably would have super-kicked him for saying.  Interestingly, you still see moments of the old Shawn tripping over some fibs and trying to bite his tongue when Bret lets him know how he really felt.

Overall, very few punches are pulled, and you get the idea that these guys needed this more than the fans needed to see it (and we want to see it pretty badly).  There are touching moments that would surprise fans and non-fans alike.  Nothing like the story that these two have will ever be matched, and hopefully (and ironically), Shawn will be the guy that Bret gets to sit down with, have a few drinks and talk old war stories well into their old age (as he very emotionally touched upon in an extra on his DVD set from a few years back after the passing of nearly all of his old friends).

Finally , this is easily one of the best DVD""s or pieces of video the WWE has ever put out.  I can't speak for the fans that are too young to have truly remembered the depths of this whole thing, but as someone who watched these guys start out as tag team rivals and end up hugging in the ring twenty years later after everything that they've both been through... more than a tear was shed.  10/10",1318291200,28,1732,4.292307692307692

This is the first in this series of famous rivals. Rock-Austin was scheduled for release but WWE keeps on juggling there dvd schedule so I don't know if that'll be released but I think they want to see how this dvd set sells first. Basically Hart and Michaels sit down and go over various topics about there feuds together. It should be a really interesting dvd. I don't own a blu ray player yet and it seems the blu ray out does the dvd on the set. I cant believe they wouldnt put the infamous Montreal job on the dvd set.

4650322,5,B005BYBZCM,"Bret is one of my all time favorite wrestlers. He was being honest and open in the interview, while Shawn was getting caught in his lies as usual.",1404950400,,146,4.25
4650323,4,B005BYBZCM,"For over a decade, fans knew of the Bret Hart/Shawn Michaels rivalry inside the ring and many knew of the rivalry outside the ring. Whether they did shoot interviews or whether it was in their books or their DVDs, Shawn and Bret never failed to mention each other. A lot of the time it was a lot of negative stuff. But here, for the first time ever, Shawn Michaels and Bret Hart sit across from each other and discuss their long history with each other, dating all the way back to 1989.

For nearly an hour, fans are treated to hear Shawn and Bret tell their stories with Jim Ross sitting in the middle of them, asking the tough questions and mentioning the hard to face topics. In a way, you could tell that Shawn and Bret really needed this to truly bury the hatchet. Sure they shook hands and hugged on a live episode of Raw but this was making amends on a whole different level. After the Montreal Screwjob, no one thought they'd see the day that Shawn Michaels and Bret Hart ever stepped foot in the same room as each other again but this DVD proves otherwise.

Shawn and Bret discuss their history beginning in 1989 and slowly delve into their encounters in the early 90s and transition their way into their more known 1996 feud and eventually hit the golden topic on the 1997 Survivor Series to their reconciliation in 2010. When I first heard that this documentary was being released, I bought it just to hear their discusssion on the Screwjob alone. And I know I probably wasn't alone in that either. It was so interesting to hear their thoughts on that infamous night and the emotions and controversy surrounding it. This DVD is really intense and at some points it even gets a little awkward. This isn't 1996 anymore. This was 2011, so both Michaels and Bret were more mature and professional doing this. Both men get emotional at various points throughout and we get a few intense moments of silence.

I bought this DVD solely for the documentary and not the matches. But viewing the matches on the next 2 discs, I was really bothered. The 1997 Survivor Series match isn't even on the DVD. It's on the Blu Ray but not the DVD. So what was perhaps the focal point of the entire Shawn vs Bret DVD and they couldn't be bothered to even put the damn Screwjob Match on the DVD??? Not even WWF segments between Bret and Shawn are on the DVD version. So basically if you want to see all the goods between Bret and Shawn, you have to buy the Blu Ray version. That really pisses me off that they screw over DVD buyers and only treat the Blu Ray buyers because in reality, everything that was on the Blu Ray should've been on the DVD but it's not. That's the only thing that robs this DVD of getting its final star to make it full blown 5 star DVD

Overall: Shawn vs Bret is an amazing DVD and despite WWE being jerks and robbing DVD owners of  classic moments, I'm proud of them at the same time for releasing this DVD as I'm sure fans of both Bret and Shawn had been waiting since 1997 to see a moment like this finally come through. Hopefully they do more Rivalry DVDs like this down the line. Maybe a Austin vs McMahon or Undertaker vs Kane or Lita vs Trish. Both this Greatest Rivalries theme has potential to become perhaps the greatest DVD series the WWE has ever done",1399075200,,3277,4.365573770491803

4650325,5,B005BYBZCM,"Shawn Michaels and Bret Hart, two legends of the ring as well as two of my all-time favorite wrestlers. Also we have Jim Ross (Good ol' JR) doing the interview. You can't go wrong with this one-kudos to WWE. The documentary was very well put together and I felt that Shawn and Bret did an oustanding job. There were some emotional pieces, but it was almost worth it in the end. It seemed that Shawn and Bret were very genuine and honest. It's hard to expect anything less out of these two. Jim Ross was good as well. I also like that Shawn and Bret's hall of fame inductions are included in full. Overall, I highly recommend this collection, not only to Shawn and Bret fans, but to all wrestling fans. This set may even interest non-wrestling fans. Ya never know!

4650326,5,B005BYBZCM,"If you're a 90's kid like myself, you more than likely watched the ""battles"" between these two. It was cool seeing their side of it and the politics that played a role in their rivalry.  If you're a fan of either wrestler than this is a must see.",1388793600,,246,4.125
4650327,2,B005BYBZCM,"Holy moses, is this guy ready to build himself a statue.  EVERY SINGLE TIME that someone else is going to get a push, or main event status, he takes it as an insult.  Whether it's Shawn Michaels, Diesel, Bob Backlund...anyone.  He always thinks they're not worthy of it and that it's a slap in the face somehow.  Hey, maybe Rick Flair wasn't thrilled about just being a ""placeholder"" champion before he lost to you.  He would have every reason to whine the way you do, wouldn't he, since he'd been wrestling for years before you even started... but he didn't.  But every time he is expected to lose, or drop the belt, it's ""disrespect.""  Just look at his book:  It seems like after every single significant match he has, someone is coming up to him ""with tears in their eyes"" telling him how amazing he is. Seriously, you could make a drinking game out of it.  The most disturbing part of the book is a brief throwaway where he mentions that as part of a promo trip to Israel, they visited the Wailing Wall I think it is, and he makes a point to say that he put his hands into handprints that allegedly belong to Jesus... and he just has to mention that they're the same size.... wow.  Okay, um, what are you getting at?  That indicates such a sick and disturbing martyr complex.  I almost wanted to stop reading right then, not because I believe in jesus or anything (I don't... I'm atheist), but that he makes such a point of mentioning it.  To what purpose, exactly?  This guy needs some serious help.  There's always an excuse for why business was down when he was champion... but if it dipped when someone else was, it was all their fault.  Go figure.  Of course all of the Bret Hart fanboys have inflated this thing's rating with scores of 5-star reviews, but that was a built-in audience.  Stay away from this.  It is non-stop self hagiography by Bret Hart.",1383782400,,1864,4.445427728613569
4650328,4,B005BYBZCM,"Really interesting, sometimes awkward sit down with Bret and Shawn. I grew up a much bigger fan of Bret than Shawn, and that kind of made this more painful.

The first disc has both men going over their careers sitting side by side and some really great stories are also told by these two, the other discs are their matches throughout their respective careers, now mind you I didn't get the blue ray so I didn't see the extras on there so i won't comment on that Im sure they are great though. After watching this myself its nice to see these two gentlemen bury the hatchet and remain friends to this day, I watched them both as a kid and found myself torn between the two at times.  Anyway I suggest you watch it if your a fan of these two I never thought I would see the two of them shake hands let alone make a dvd together, another great addition is JR as the moderator. Just one thing though, Shawn does talk a little softly and lets bret do most of the talking so id say turn the volume up on him.",1376092800,2,925,4.0271739130434785

4650343,5,B005BYBZCM,"This set has one of the WWE's best documentaries. The entire feature is Jim Ross sitting with Bret and Shawn exchanging stories about their similar paths to the top and the crumbling of their professional relationship.

The matches are great. Watching Bret and Shawn evolve from tag team competitors to intercontinental champions to the top of the WWF brought back many memories.",1365811200,,379,5.112903225806452
4650344,5,B005BYBZCM,"It was very compelling to watch since the works going into a Wrestlemania rematch got taken out of context and it turned an ugly real life battle over respect, but I did have a few gripes with it:

- It needed to be longer. Given the material from a 23 year span, 2 hours just wasn't enough.

- Stuff being overlooked like the ""Wrestling With Shadows"" documentary and film crew involvement, Bret's creative control clause as it was major issue heading into Survivor Series 1997 since McMahon refused to honor it. Also, both men's title accomplishments post-Montreal (Bret's tag, US, and world wins and Shawn's last world title win). I know Bret wasn't happy in WCW mainly due to being held down as a top guy, but they still could've at least mentioned that.

- Bret has gone back and forth on some stuff since reconcilng with the company and Shawn which is expected for the best interests of all parties, but one thing that bothered me was on his 2005 DVD, Bret was offended that Shawn told him to get out of the ring. Now Bret said that was never an issue? Uh...okay?

- Given his attitude problems and dislike for Bret back then and the fishy timing of the forfeit a month before Wrestlemania 13, I think it was easier for Shawn to give up the title instead of doing 2 high profile jobs back to back (Sid and Hart). I wish Shawn would've admitted his ""career ending"" knee injury was a lie /exaggeration to further resolve things.

- Even if you were on Vince's side for the Montreal ""Incident"" (I guess Screwjob isn't PG friendly) or weren't a Hitman fan at all, it was easier to connect, and maybe on the matter even sympathize, with Bret because he was personable and came off as real. I didn't really get that with Shawn. I saw a man struggling with how to handle his guilt. Lots of stammering and repetition. For a guy whose born again and said multiple times he ""didn't care"", it just seemed like HBK had issues about coming clean or fully admitting his wrong doings. Given the environment, I just don't understand why Michaels would still insist on protecting his image. He didn't do a very good job of presenting himself to smooth things over with his haters and it shows.",1364083200,,2181,4.497474747474747

For wrestling fans, this tells the story of this historical rivalry. From being good friends to hatred. And neither truly hold any punches, which I liked. I could tell it was genuine. And it's nice to see that they can sit down and actually discuss everything, from the early days to the Montreal screw job.

Hart, especially, comes off well in this as he seems to reflect a bit more. After that incident, his life didn't go all too well. But he shows how he got over it, got rid of the hate and found a way to forgive. Despite it being the zany world of wrestling, his reflection on being able to forgive is inspiring.

The one thing that really threw me off was not including the actual screw job match on the DVD and having it as a Blue Ray extra. Though this rivalry went well beyond incident, that is one most people will remember and I think the WWE did a disservice by not including it on each set, hence the 4-star rating.

This is definitely one for wrestling fans though and I'd highly recommend it.",1357603200,2,1225,4.29004329004329

The whole feud with Shawn Michaels and Bret Hart was one of the main matches in WWF back in the 1990's that made me a wrestling fan.  And just as interesting as the matches themselves is the real-life, behind-the-scenes drama that Bret & Shawn experienced.  Two of the best in-ring workers ever and their best matches together are profiled.  The whole documentary was interesting to say the least, though it does feel somewhat forced and revisionist history[kinda like Bret was trying to hard to get along].  Both guys have interesting sides of their accounts of what happened both in and out of the ring with both having failing memories at times.  Overall, it doesn't take away from the documentary though and both guys seem at peace with the whole Montreal situation.  Any true fan of pro wrestling will appreciate this honest and candid account of one of the most authentic feuds in history.",1345852800,,943,4.748466257668712

Der eine (Hart), man mu&szlig; es ihm ja trotz aller eigenen Schuld, die auch er dabei tr&auml;gt, hier schon zugestehen: als Betrogener. Der andere (Michaels) als ein, auf gewisse Weise, besonders anschlie&szlig;ender Nutznieser der ganzen Situation ... und, was nur verwerflich bleibt: zumindest doch schon Mitwisser der ganzen Szenerie.

- / -

Dieser unr&uuml;hmliche Ausgang des letzten Matches dieser beiden, geplant als Titelverteidigung, am Ende der Survivor Series 1997 ist inzwischen in die Wrestling - Geschichte eingegangen. Vincent Kennedy McMahon zeigte hier (den Fans) vor allem, was ihn ja vielleicht zu einem guten Gesch&auml;fsmann macht, ihn rein menschlich betrachtet, aber immer wieder komplett disqualifiziert.

Der ""Hitman"" ging einen Tag sp&auml;ter zum damaligen Konkurrenten, der WCW, bei dem er bereits einen Vertrag unterzeichnet hatte und schwor anschlie&szlig;end, nie wieder vor eine WWF Kamera zu treten, nicht noch einmal mit Vince McMahon zusammen zu arbeiten bzw. &uuml;berhaupt jemals wieder an einer Veranstaltung seines ehemaligen Arbeitgebers mitzuwirken (was so nat&uuml;rlich auch deren sp&auml;tere VHS, - und DVD Ver&ouml;ffentlichungen usw. mit einschlo&szlig;).

Die WWF hielt sich hier weniger daran, das eines Tages Ruhe und Frieden einkehren k&ouml;nnte. Bereits bei der Beerdigung (!) seines Bruders, Owen Hart, der durch einen tragischen Ringunfall 1999 t&ouml;tlich verungl&uuml;ckte, wurde dessen Trauerfeier durch Kamerateams seitens der WWF mitgefilmt und so versucht, das noch zu vermarkten.

- / -

Schlie&szlig;lich tauchte Bret Hart, nach &uuml;ber 12 Jahren WWE (fr&uuml;her) WWF - Abstinenz dann doch am 04.01.2010 wieder bei einer Montagsshow ""RAW"" auf und begrub dort seine langj&auml;hrigen Differenzen mit Shawn Michaels im Ring &ouml;ffentlich (f&uuml;r die Fans) mit Handschlag und sogar anschlie&szlig;ender Umarmung.

In Wahrheit hatte man sich schon vorher privat zusammengesetzt und alles endlich professionell geregelt. Der Auftritt an diesem Abend fiel dementsprechend etwas ""frostiger"" aus (Emotionen und Reaktion von Michaels), was aber so abgesprochen war.

Anschlie&szlig;end f&uuml;hrte er seinen bereits 2003 verstorbenen Vater, Stu Hart, anl&auml;&szlig;lich der Feierlichkeiten in die WWE Hall of Fame ein.

Sogar ein paar Jahre zuvor, 2006, bei seiner eigenen WWE - Hall of Fame Einf&uuml;hrung k&uuml;ndigte derselbe Bret Hart noch an, sollte er Shawn Michaels backstage begegnen oder ihn w&auml;hrend der Veranstaltung irgendwo innerhalb des Publikums erblicken, w&uuml;rde er sofort abreisen und so nicht seine dort bereits geplante Rede halten.

Und auch am darauf folgenden Tag, bei der Wrestlemania 22 Gro&szlig;veranstaltung, bei der eben alle Hall of Famer des jeweiligen Jahres (besonders medienwirksam) nun noch einmal vorgestellt werden, blieb er selbst fern. Nur die restliche Hart Familie nahm dort eben stellvertretend f&uuml;r ihn teil.

- / -

Aber, nach Shawn Michaels - ofiziell - letztem Match, - am Ende von Wrestlemania 26, sah man es doch deutlich (gefilmt hinter den Kulissen), das beide M&auml;nner sich wirklich verst&auml;ndigt haben. Damit ging eine Rivalit&auml;t zu Ende, die beinahe episch ist.

Mit Vince McMahon hatte sich der ""Hitman"" bereits Ende 2009 verst&auml;ndigt und auch, wieder einen neuen Vertrag unterzeichnet. Ihre Feindschaft (dh. vor der Kamera !) sollte nun in einem Match, ebenfalls bei Wrestlemania 26, damit offiziell enden.

Ebenfalls mit Ringrichter Earl Hebner einigte sich Bret Hart bereits Jahre zuvor wieder. Besonders von ihm war Hart am mei&szlig;tens entt&auml;uscht, nachdem er sich den ganzen Betrug damals nochmal als Aufzeichnung ansah.

Was hier aber geschah ... bzw. geschehen ist, bleibt dennoch einzigartig. Zum einen, weil abseits der offiziellen ""Fehden"" immer auch eine reale Antipathie, zumindest zwischen Shawn Michaels und Bret Hart bestand. Zum anderen, da der Betrug, dieser sogenannte ""Montreal Screwjob"" von 1997 ebenso real passierte.

Und, falls es jemand noch nicht wu&szlig;te, nicht die einzige unsch&ouml;ne Aktion dieser Art seitens Vince McMahon bzw. der WWF war ! ! ! Einige Jahre zuvor, 1983, geschah n&auml;mlich ein &auml;nlicher Vorfall mit dem damaligen Champion, Bob Backlund. Auch ihn betrog man.

Dennoch, w&auml;re es nicht zu diesen Ereignissen gekommen, h&auml;tte es m&ouml;glicherweise niemals eine Attitude &Auml;ra der WWF gegeben. W&auml;re es nicht geschehen, h&auml;tte diese WWF sich m&ouml;glicherweise nie gegen ihre besonders starke, ehemalige Konkurrenz (WCW und ECW) durchsetzen k&ouml;nnen ... bzw. diese sp&auml;ter &uuml;bernehmen und so das Monopol halten k&ouml;nnen.

Wie man sieht, geht es hier um weit mehr, - viel mehr als nur um die Rivalit&auml;t zwischen Bret Hart und Shawn Michaels.

4650381,5,B005BYBZCM,"I had already read Shawn's book about two years ago, and when I heard WWE was coming out with ""Shawn vs Bret"" Blu-ray collection with an in-depth sit down interview conducted by Jim Ross, I knew I had to read Bret's book as well. I had to be impartial, and wanted to get a better understanding of this epic rivalry by hearing from the two sides. Now, both books were written long before the reconciliation between these two Hall of Famers, so it was great to see the transformation between how they once thought, to how they are now. The emotions emanating from these two could be felt, and I've always felt more for Bret because he went through so much. But you also have to feel for Shawn because he had to carry the guilt of being the S.O.B. that did what he did. For anyone who is a fan, who gets wrestling, and wishes to look behind the curtain and to see the real men behind these larger than life characters... you can't go wrong.",1340496000,,937,4.299435028248587
4650382,5,B005BYBZCM,"The documentary alone is worth the price of the DVD/Blu-Ray. The documentary is quite long, which is a good thing, because it gave Michaels and Hart plenty of time to chew on topics we all wanted to know like: what did these two guys *really* think of each other, behind the scenes stuff on the ""screw-job"" and first impressions of each other just to name a few of the topics. The interview/discussion between the two and J.R. is kind of tense. While the guys did laugh and stuff, there wasn't a lot of eye contact between Michaels and Hart which speaks volumes to me. I think it shows that the two have reconciled their differences, but they don't plan on being bffs anytime soon, which is understandable given their history and their personality types.

What about the extras? Well, if the documentary sucked then this dvd wouldn't be able to sell. Michaels and Hart didn't have a ton of matches, so the match selection is kind of weak, but the ones that are included are solid matches worth watching. Keep in mind there aren't many though. The other extras like interviews, promos and stuff are enjoyable as well.

If you're a WWE historian, Michaels and/or Hart fan then you will enjoy this dvd. Buy it.",1340150400,,1207,4.609302325581395
4650383,5,B005BYBZCM,"I loved this dvd.  It's the most candid, real interview I think either of these men have ever given.  They explore every aspect of their feuds over the years, not just the events leading up to and including the Montreal Screwjob.  I also think it's nice that they were able to sit down and act like men for once and hash out their differences instead of being childish and doing it behind each others backs.  Jim Ross does a great job interviewing the men as well.  Included as extras in the dvd is almost every one of their matches...as single comptetitors and as tag team competitors as well.  Every important match is in there.  If you specifically want to see the Montreal Screwjob match however, you must purchase the blu-ray as that match is not included on the regualr dvd.  It's a blu-ray exclusive.",1336608000,,807,4.555555555555555
4650384,4,B005BYBZCM,"I liked watching the main interview with Shawn and Bret. They talked about how they loved the idea when the Rockers and Heart Foundation had great matches together. They talked about how they were closed buddies afterwards. They talked about how things started to change in the WWE. They helped make the WWE what it is today. They made changes and proved that they can make better matches showing what they can do in the ring than what bigger guys were doing back then. Then, they talked about how they showed regular sized guys can be the WWE camp too.

They talked about how they grew apart from being closed friends to just friends and finally hating each other. Then, they talked about all the rumors, lies, truth about their matches and behind the scenes lives. It was awesome to learn about what they really did and the truth behind it.

What I just didn't like about it was Shawn speaking skills. He can't really do a good interview. He awesome performer and his matches are great, but he just doesn't know how to express himself. He likes to talk in a lot of pluses and use the ""YOU KNOW"" all the time. He can talk and more than half of what he said was ""YOU KNOW"". Please, Shawn learn how to express yourself! It gets ignoring hearing him saying those words over and over again. I'm thinking to myself, do I really know? Why am I watching this then? Just tell me Shawn!

On the other hand, Bret knows how to do a well spoken interview. You can listen to him and he knows how to express his feelings and what he thinks about situations. He thinks first and then says it. Sounds easy but it's not. Many people don't know how to take some time to sync up with their minds and express feelings. Many people freezes up and does what Shawn does. Bret great interview and well said! Thanks for the insight!

Get this DVD to find out what really went on with these two.",1335657600,,1870,4.364942528735632
4650385,5,B005BYBZCM,"I finally got around to ordering and watching this DVD. As a fan that watched these two come up through the WWE ranks, and as someone who sites Bret Hart as a personal hero, this DVD was a MUST. I ended up getting it for my birthday and today I took the time to watch it.

To hear these two legends speak of their careers and to have the always excellent JR conducting the interview was almost to unreal to believe. The interview delivers and I for one was completely satisfied. Listening to Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels talk about how things started off with mutual respect and degenerated into a personal rivalry with each guy taking very personal verbal cheap-shots at each other week in and week out on national TV during the late 90's was so incredibly fascinating.

As a fan I watched this unfold as it happened. I was glued to RAW in those days and it was so great to see the classic clips and segments with the two guys involved talking about how this all came to be. Of course the Montreal incident was discussed, the emotion from both men, as they reflect on those events was moving.

I can't say enough about this DVD. I am a die-hard Bret Hart fan, and this DVD delivered. I have to use another day or two to go over all the extras. It is nice to have all those matches in one great place.

The one thing that I was wishing, is that Bret never had that stroke. If Bret and Shawn could have a match today they would school everybody currently employed in todays WWE.

If you were a fan this is a DVD for you!",1334793600,,1519,4.224137931034483
4650386,5,B005BYBZCM,If you were a fan of the attitude era. You know the Story between these two great stars. What an awesome look at what behind the scenes reactions between them. This is a must own.,1333238400,,179,4.142857142857143
4650387,5,B005BYBZCM,"This is one of the best WWE Home Video releases in a while. The main part is a new interview with both competitors sitting down with one another and discussing their mutual rise and falling out. This also goes in-depth on the infamous ""Montreal Screwjob.""I really hope this starts a trend and WWE releases more ""Greatest Rivalries"" videos.",1332028800,,339,4.862068965517241
4650388,5,B005BYBZCM,"Just saw this today. This was an honest sit down interview between two of the greatest WWE performers of all time. I felt that Bret came across as very open and honest. That's not to say Shawn didn't, but I believe Bret was a little more so. It's great that these two have finally aired their issues with one another and have finally come to point of forgiveness and healing. Great stuff. Highly recommend this DVD. Well worth the money.",1331942400,2,437,4.475
4650389,5,B005BYBZCM,"I have seen bits and pieces of this and it looks great but I'm writing just to get an idea out there. How about a WWE Rivalries: Ultimate Warrior vs. Hulk Hogan shoot interview such as this one.

Just saying, I think it would be a big seller. I know they only wrestled twice but the longterm rivalry is really big and I think a lot of older wrestling fans would love it.

WWE please look into this.",1329350400,,398,4.089743589743589
4650390,1,B005BYBZCM,"Read Bret's book and watch his DVD he had released in 2005, and then watch this. His stories don't match each other and he comes across as a big liar. They take shots at the 80's and all of the big guys, and that is just plain stupid! If it were not for Hulk Hogan WWE would not be here today. Bret even makes the claim that back in the 80's kids would go home talking about his tag matches instead of the matches Hogan and the other big guys would be in.

This DVD makes me sick! Bret even called Hulk Hogan boring! That made me laugh because I have heard a lot of people bash Hogan but calling a man who got the biggest pop from the crowd almost every event he was at back in his wrestling days boring is a pretty stupid comment. Get over it Bret, Hogan is better than you are and he always will be you big cry baby!",1326931200,3,818,3.927710843373494
4650391,5,B005BYBZCM,This was a really great interview featuring the two that explores the rumors and tension involved with their personal relationship. It wasn't a rewrite of the events that happened. I enjoyed it a lot.,1325894400,,200,4.911764705882353
4650392,5,B005BYBZCM,"One of the best phenomena's of wrestling is that the truth, is better than the storylines that wrestling conjure up. This was the utmost human drama and the honesty that both men had in this documentary was amazing. Jim Ross does a great job moderating and I think Bret Hart gets the vindication that he surely deserves and Shawn Michaels gets to put Montreal behind him for good. Michaels should get a lot of credit because he does his best mea culpa and it is without question easily believable and sincere. To Bret's credit he also comes across as less mean spirited and more forgiving. It was something I think both people needed. Bret is my favorite wrestler and I am glad he got to do this. This showed me a different side of Shawn Michaels and I was glad to see it. Worth buying for sure!",1325548800,3,795,4.414965986394558
4650393,5,B005BYBZCM,"I have all the dvds but this one is unique how both superstars are sitting right next to each other. Notice how quiet hbk is. Real detailed in depth the beginning, middle and now. Highly recommended!",1325203200,,199,4.555555555555555
4650394,2,B005BYBZCM,"The sit down interview was excellent. I hung on every word spoken by both Hart and Micheals because as a fan I have always found the ""Montreal screw-job"" to be so incredibly intriguing. To get the information first hand from these superstars was worth the price of this DVD set. Which is why it is important to note just how great the interview was because not only could the match selection have been stronger, but much more relevant. I could overlook many matches not being here, but the actual match that brought all the drama in the first place should be included in this DVD set (It's flat-out wrong that the amazing Montreal match be provided exclusively to the BLU-RAY release). For many, this compilation will be the first taste of the Hart-Micheals saga so they should have access to the Montreal bout on DVD. I have been there since day one, seen and heard it all. All that was missing for me was this interview so I am very grateful for this WWE release. But for those who wish to have the full effect of this incredible chapter in sports entertainment will have to find the missing  pieces elsewhere.",1325030400,6,1112,4.56
4650395,4,B005BYBZCM,I thought this was a pretty decent release by the WWE and something any longtime fan would enjoy. I was interested in hearing the story of the Montreal incident from both Bret and Shawn. Another thing I was interested in was the ladder match for the IC belt in 92. Great match and the best part of this set. My only gripes are that I wish the main feature wouldve gone on a little longer. They couldve added a few more subjects to discuss. Also including the iron man match is a waste since most anyone buying this probably has the other Bret and Shawn releases. Overall though it's a good set to add to your collection.,1324944000,,620,4.3076923076923075
4650396,5,B005BYBZCM,"I bought the Blu-Ray and loved it from start to end.

Whoever gave this 1 star is and ID 10 T.",1324598400,,94,3.4761904761904763
4650397,5,B005BYBZCM,"Well, i can't say much about this cause is a gift for my husband, but as far as I can see is a excellent option to whom happens to love wrestling, the blu ray edition has a mtach that the dvd version hasn't. Long life to Bret Hart!",1323993600,,231,3.8333333333333335
4650398,5,B005BYBZCM,"For anyone who followed the Montreal Screwjob this is a must see.  Finally, all sides of the story are revealed first hand and a satisfactory ending to this fued takes place.",1323475200,,174,4.612903225806452
4650399,5,B005BYBZCM,"I bought this DVD with hopefully a little more insight into the 2 greatest wrestlers of all time imo. It was more than worth it. Just to see the emotion made it worth it. The minor qualms I do have wasn't with the actual contents of the DVD, but the condition the DVD was received in. Disc 2 was missing the holder to keep the disc in place and therefore has a very noticeable scratch that makes me miss out on one of the matches but what can ya do? Definitely worth the purchase nonetheless.",1323216000,,492,4.189473684210526
4650410,5,B005BYBZCM,"I never thought I'd see these two great icons in the same room together, and they don't want to kick each other. This dvd I have to say for me was very intense. I had only become a Bret Hart fan recently and I was in tears when he and HBK finally on that historic night on Raw made peace. This dvd really shows you how they both have put things aside and now they're ready to start a new leaf. It's a must have for all wrestling fans.",1322956800,,434,3.8876404494382024
4650411,5,B005BYBZCM,Great DVD!!! A certain collectible for all HBK (and Bret Hart) fans!!! Thank you for the quick shipment!!!  Clear DVD!!!,1322352000,,120,5.0
4650412,5,B005BYBZCM,"Excellent interview conducted by Jim Ross and excellent matches make this a must own for any true wrestling fan. Just going on the Blu ray version on this one, but it's an excellent release by WWE.

Plenty of never before released matches, highlighted by the 1993 steel cage match called by Gorilla Monsoon and ECW's Raven before he was Raven! Can't go wrong with this set.",1322092800,,373,4.651515151515151
4650413,5,B005BYBZCM,"So here we are with another DVD to review and I got to say that this one was good although some of the matches we have seen many times before.  I do hope that this is a series that the WWE continues to do as I think it would be a great series to continue.  The set starts with a documentary where both Bret and Shawn sit down with Jim Ross to discuss their feud (did you ever think you would see the day?).  It is a great documentary from start to finish and very well done.  It pretty much starts with how they started out and then we get into how they started as opponents on tag teams.  Bret of course was with the Hart Foundation and Shawn was with the Rockers.  The disc then goes into how they competed against each other for the IC title and some early world title matches.  After that we get the whole 1996 era where Shawn would be made the world champion.  I do like and found it interesting that at first Bret thought Shawn would be a good choice to be champ and then Shawn would talk to him about how when he is champ he's going to go up against Kevin Nash and then Scott Hall then Kid then Hunter, all of his friends and that made Bret rethink his original feeling on Shawn as champ.  After that then we get into the 1997 era and of course Montreal.  This is probably the part that everyone will be looking forward to but really the whole set is just a great piece of history in your fingertips.  Lastly, we get into them making peace with each other after like 13 years and what the future holds.  This documentary is one of the best that the WWE has done in some time and it is priceless.  Disc 2 and 3 are the matches and they are great.  The first one is a tag match with the Rockers against the Hart Foundation at MSGin 1989.  This is a great match that has been released before, but only like once so if you've never seen it this will be a treat for you.  I have said it before that I personally own around 10 of their matches maybe more and honestly they do a lot of the same spots over and over in the matches so really if you've seen one of their matches then you've seen them all.  The next one is Shawn vs Bret from Wrestling Challenge in 1990 while both were still in tag teams.  It's a rare match that hasn't been released before and it's pretty good.  It's a good preview as to what was to come from these two.  Then we get a real treat with another tag match but this time from Tokyo Dome in Japan in 1991.  This is a fantastic match and in this one they do do some different things that is just great.  This is one that I got to say I am suprised the WWE put on here but I am glad that they did.  This one really is worth the price of the set alone.  Next is the first ladder match in WWE for the IC title between the two.  This one has been released before and is really a substandard ladder match.  Bret Hart has said time and again that this was just basically an exhibition match.  He wanted to use this type of match at Summerslam 1992 because Shawn was originally supposed to take on Bret before Bulldog got the match, but Vince wasn't sure so Bret said that he and Shawn would demostrate the basics of the match and then Vince could view it and make a decision.  After viewing the match, you can see they played it very safe.  Still, it was an ok match.  The next one is another match that I don't think has been released before as it is an IC title from Syracuse NY.  This is a classic match, very well done between the two.  Up next is a world title match from Survivor Series 1992 where both men were in the main event.  This is probably in my opinion the best match that both guys have ever had.  This match is ultra good with counters for counters, chain wrestling, mat wrestling and a little bit of high flying mixed in as well.  This one is a very very very good match.  The last match on disc 2 is a world title cage match from Utica NY.  This is another rare match that hasn't been released before and it's ok.  There's nothing really special that happens in the cage, it's just ok.  On disc 2 we get the Iron Man match from Wrestlemania 12 where Shawn wins the world title.  This is a fantastic match where we get to see both guys ply their craft for over an hour.  This one just keeps you on the edge of your seat.  One thing to look for is how unprofessional Shawn is at the end of the match when he tells the referee (you can read his lips) he tells the ref to get Bret out of the f'ing ring.  Talk about being ignorant.  Then you get Bret Hart's induction to the Hall of Fame, his return to Raw and finally Shawn's induction to the Hall of Fame.  All in all a very good set.  One thing that bothers me is honestly the one thing that made their feud sizzle was the Montreal Screwjob and if you buy the regular DVD set it's not on there!  Really?!  They do put it on the Blu Ray set but not the standard set.  I think they may do that so people pay more money and buy the BR set but just to let the WWE know:  Not everyone owns a BR player.  The rest of the BR extras are pretty substandard and not really worth going into.  Again, great set just wish the WWE had included that Montreal match on the standard set and here's hoping that the WWE continues this series.",1322006400,,5213,4.041015625
4650414,5,B005BYBZCM,"I haven't watched wrestling on tv in yrs, and I ordered this DVD only bc a friend had recommended it. I am so glad I did. This DVD was nothing short of amazing. Shawn Michaels and Bret Hart are two of the greatest wrestlers ever imo. Watching their sit down with JR and hearing about their history with each other was very intriguing. And re-watching all the matches between these extraordinary athletes reminded me of why I fell in love with professional wrestling to begin with. I look forward to watching the DVD of these two Hall of Famers over and over and over again!",1321142400,,573,4.466666666666667
4650415,5,B005BYBZCM,"One is from Texas, the other from Canada, one was trained to become a wrestler, the other was brought up in the business from birth. One is Shawn Michaels, the other is Bret Hart and this is a look at their careers, how they grew up, how they succeeded in the business and also how the personal issues would cause a rift between them that lasted for almost 13 years.

-Jim Ross welcomes us as he will be interviewing Shawn & Bret, in between every match or set of clips both men talk about many things both in and outside the ring.

-Both talk about how they debuted in WWE as part of a tag team and how they both wanted to work with each other. From there the story continues to evolve, from tag team wrestling to their singles pushes, their clash at Wrestlemania XII, the bad blood that brewed throughout much of '97, the infamous screwjob. Then how their personal lives were effected since then. The tension stayed between them until early 2010 when they met face to face on an episode of Monday Night Raw.

Other things that are discussed include Bret's feelings towards Shawn changing after Shawn's match with Diesel at Wrestlemania XI, his time in WCW, the reasons he left WWE and plenty of other good topics. Thankfully the interview segments are quite good, at times emotional and at least honest especially on Bret's side.

Matches Include:

-11/25/89, The Rockers vs. The Hart Foundation: At the most famous arena Madison Square Garden we see these two great teams face off. Both of their styles mix very well, good fast paced wrestling between Bret and Jannetty early on, with each man countering the other on some occasions. Anvil uses his power but its countered by both Rockers who uses their quickness. The Foundation work over Michaels with some nice double teaming and submission moves. The rest of the match is back and forth action between both men. The 20 minute time limit expires, resulting in a draw. Great, great match here. 9/10.

-2/10/90, Wrestling Challenge, Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels: While they were both still part of their respective tag teams, Breat and Shawn faced off in this rarely seen TV match. They trade good wrestling holds and Bret does his best to keep the faster Michaels on the mat, though Shawn does get in a couple of moves too. Both their tag partners get involved and the ref calls for a double dq. 5/10.

-3/30/91, The Rockers vs. The Hart Foundation: From the Tokyo Dome, we have an even rarer tag match, between two of the best tag teams the WWE has ever seen. You get the expected great double team moves from all four, while Neidhart uses his power to throw around the smaller Rockers. The action stays at a good fast, constant pace with both teams trading momentum. Bret ends up reversing a crossbody by Shawn into a cover that leads to a three count. 8/10.

-7/21/92, Intercontinental Championsip Match, Bret Hart (Champion) vs. Shawn Michaels: From a house show in Portland, Maine for the Intercontinental Title. The very first WWF ladder match is a good technical bout, with very few uses of the ladder. Bret goes shoulder first into the ladder, Shawn gets slingshotted into the ladder in the corner. The finish comes when Bret dropkicks Shawn off of the ladder over the top rope and out of the ring, Bret then climbs the ladder and grabs the belt to retain the title in about 14.5 minutes. 7/10.

-4/29/92, Intercontinental Championship Match, Bret Hart (Champion) vs. Shawn Michaels: Good but short wrestling match, Bret works on Shawn's arm with an arm bar, while Shawn uses the speed edge to wear down Bret. Shawn almost has the champ beat on a couple of occasions and does end up winning via countout, but he doesn't win the title. 6/10. Nice post match where Shawn punches out the ref then Bret comes in and beats Michaels out of the ring.

-11/25/92, Survivor Series, WWE Title Match: Bret Hart (Champion) vs. Shawn Michaels (I.C. Champion): These two have never had a bad match and this is no exception as both brought their A-games and Shawn had some good momentum having just won the I.C. title a couple of weeks before. Shawn really stepped up his game and had the Hitman on the ropes on several occasions, but Bret pulled out the victory after catching Michaels jumping from the top rope and trapping him in the Sharpshooter to retain his title in about 25 minutes. 9/10.

-12/1/93, Steel Cage Match, Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels: Yet another rare match between these two, this time in the steel cage structure. Its fairly hard hitting as both make good use of the cage, Bret gets the back of his head rammed into the cage wall a few times and both actually wrestle quite a bit too. At the end both are climbing over the top of the cage, Shawn's foot gets caught in the cage wall and Bret drops to the floor to win the match. 7/10.

-3/31/96-Wrestlemania XII-60 Minute Iron Man Match for the WWE Title, Shawn Michaels vs. Bret Hart (Champion): Not as good, but not as bad as the praisers and detractors say. I liked it, though would hardly call it ""the best match ever"" though it is on my Top 50 list of them. The man who scores the most falls in the 60 minute time limit wins the match and the belt. There were plenty of wrestling holds put on by both men, though in the beginning Shawn was beating Bret with wrestling moves and holds, but then after the match was back and forth for the most part. Although Bret got Shawn in the Sharpshooter in the last 30 seconds of the match, Shawn didn't give up and the match ended without either man getting a fall. But president Gorilla Monsoon came down and restarted the match, stating that there must be a winner. Michaels hits Sweet Chin Music to win the WWE Title about 2 minutes into the overtime period. 9/10.

-4/1/06, Bret Hart's Hall of Fame Induction Speech: Stone Cold Steve Austin cuts a funny speech before introducing Bret Hart, The Hitman gives a good emotional speech where he talks about his time growing up and his career. Its certainly the highlight of the 2006 Hall of Fame speeches.

-1/4/10, Raw, Bret Hart's WWE Return: Easily one moment I thought I'd never see as Bret made his return to WWE television, he cut a good promo in the ring mainly thanking the fans for their continued support. Shawn Michael's music hit and these two finally meet face to face on live TV. The promo these two cut was pretty good and kinda eerie given all that happened in Montreal years back. It ends with both of them shaking hands and hugging which truly did finally put this issue to rest.

-4/2/11, Shawn Michael's Hall of Fame Induction Speech: There's a nice montage of comments from various superstars talking about Michaels before they show a video package of his best moments in his career. Triple H tells some funny stories but then says he's here to induct his long time friend into the hall of fame before introducing the man himself. Shawn gives a very good heartfelt speech about many things in his life, his career, how he misses the fans and how he gave his all to them. Its a great speech that sees some of his friends from the past celebrate with him, Kevin Nash and Sean Waltman as the show comes to a close.

Blu-Ray Exclusive Content

-2/3/97, Raw: Live from the Toronto Skydome we get this good promo, where both banter about a couple of topics mainly their dislike for each other. Stone Cold Steve Austin hits the ring and attacks Bret. Sid then hits the ring and back from commercial break Shawn and Bret face off, Bret grabs the title belt and hands it to Shawn then walks off.

-5/12/97, Raw: The Hart Foundation is in the ring with Bret in a wheelchair, but he sends them back to the ring. Bret then cuts a promo and calls out Shawn Michaels, this leads to a good promo where it ends with Shawn superkicking Bret out of his wheelchair. The Foundation hits the ring and battles with Shawn up the ram, Austin comes out and both take it to the Foundation before the refs break it up.

-5/19/97, Raw: Once again the Foundation are in the ring and Bret cuts another promo first bashing the U.S. and then Shawn Michaels, who then appears on the titan tron and cuts his own promo where he says if they have a match that each of the Foundation members must be handcuffed to a ring post. This is also the promo where Shawn says the famed ""Sunny Days"" line, in reference to Bret possibly being with at the time WWE Diva Sunny.

-11/9/97, Survivor Series, WWE Championship Match, Bret Hart (Champion) vs. Shawn Michaels: This of course is the infamous Montreal Screwjob match and even without knowing that prior to watching it, you can just feel that something is not right. Both men brawl outside the ring for a good while, with Bret beating on Shawn slamming him into the guardrail and steel steps. Once they get in the ring the match officially starts and the canadian crowd is on fire for Bret everytime he has the edge. Once Shawn gets Bret locked in the sharpshooter, the ref Earl Hebner calls for the bell early and thus the screwjob occurs. 8/10 for the match, 12/10 for the aftermath where Bret spits on Vince McMahon, just too bad the rest of it wasn't included.

-The First WWE Ladder Match: Bret and Shawn both talk about having the first WWE ladder match, where Bret talks about how he introduced the idea and how it was more of a demonstration of the ladder match concept. Shawn also says he enjoyed doing the match as well.

-Summerslam 1992: Bret talks about how the British Bulldog wasn't really prepared for their match at Summerslam, he had a bad staph infection (allegedly according to Bret) and wasn't in the best of shape coming into the match. He also says he basically had to carry Bulldog through the match and that Davey wasn't very appreciative at the time of the push he got. Shawn chimes in saying he worked with Rick Martel at that event and that he was finding his way and not at the level he would be at years later.

-Winning the WWE Championship for the First Time: Bret talks about winning his first WWE championship from Ric Flair and how he found out that he would win the title that morning before the event.

-Bret's WCW Regrets: Very choice words by the Hitman for Hulk Hogan, Eric Bischoff and WCW as a whole.

-Cameras Rolling Between Takes: Some funny outtakes from both guys, very good stuff.

While maybe not the most groundbreaking DVD ever, there is some good insight from both guys especially Bret and the stories told are very good and many fans will enjoy this DVD. The matches are also quite good and its nice to see the Montreal Screwjob match included even if its just on the Blu-Ray set.",1320883200,4,10576,4.529874213836478

4650417,5,B005BYBZCM,"Simply put, this DVD/Blu-Ray  I got the Blu-Ray) is freakin' awesome. It's a very frank, open and honest discussion between Jim Ross, Bret and Shawn over the attitudes, feelings, opinions, grudges, whether personal or professional, that plagued these 2 rivals over the course of a 10-12 year span or so leading up to Montreal and the feelings and issues that affected both men in the years that followed right up to and including present day, which peaked with the very real and intense real-life in-ring confrontation/reconciliation between the 2 men in January 2010 on Raw, one that nobody in the business, especially the 2 men involved, let alone their millions of worldwide fans would ever thought they'd ever ever see. Bret comes off as much much more emotional during the interview but Shawn is admirably open and honest and refreshingly candid are both men as they each take their shares of responsibility for the things that happened and ultimately put them into the respective positions that they found themselves in on that fateful night at Survivor Series '97. To anyone who has ever been plagued by questions or the mysteries surrounding the long-standing animosity between these two, this DVD or Blu-Ray, the interview specifically, provides some if not most of the answers you would seek. Jim Ross did an outstanding job conducting this interview, asked the tough questions, asked the right ones and got the story, pretty much all of it. Best DVD set WWF/WWE has put out in years; as a fan of both men, I highly recommend this one to everyone, as both men would almost certainly make anyone's list of top 10 or even top 5 greatest of all time, if they know what they're talking about, that is. Overall, just a great, great addition to my collection, as it would be to anybody's.",1320451200,,1792,4.837133550488599

4650419,5,B005BYBZCM,I have been a wrestling fan for 20 years. my two favorate wrestlers growing up were bret hart and shawn micheals. so I couldn't wait to get this dvd set. i am just going to cover the 2 hour interview because I'm sure that's why people would buy this. First off kudos to all three men involved in this interview. Jim Ross doesn't pull any punches when it comes to his questions. and he also doesn't show any favortism for bret or shawn during the interview. he realizes this is mearly a means for bret and shawn to get everything off their chest. In a weird way this was kind of like couples therapy.  They start out by going over both mens careers and rises from tag team to single stars. They talk about the infamous 2 out 3 falls rockers hart foundation tag title match where the ropes broke during the match. you could tell both men were dissapointed because they had a lot of ideas for this match and they wanted it to be really special. and it was evident that early on before any of the controversy they were actually friends. bret says that shawn used to come over to his house and such. it is also very clear both men wanted the other to suceed in their singles careers. they wanted to pave way for the smaller guys to make an impact on the main event scene. the most interesting part of the documentary was when they discussed what the plan was going into their classic iron man match.  they discuss what was real and what wasn't real about their feud and how it got out of control. They really don't pull any punches when it comes to the montreal screw job. you could tell both men wanted closure as they both get very emotional especially towards the end when they discuss when bret came back to raw and why shawn waited so long to patch things up with bret. so i recommend this set for any wrestling fan that's interested in wrestling history.,1320278400,,1855,4.327586206896552
4650420,4,B005BYBZCM,"Bret and Shawn are pro wrestling's version of Leno/Conan and Shaq/Kobe.  Two great performers in a bitter real life rivalry that fascinated hard core wrestling fans ending with one of them ultimately being pushed out.  At the 1997 Survivor Series in Montreal Bret Hart lost the WWF championship to Shawn Michaels when WWF boss Vince McMahon, Shawn Michaels and referee Earl Hebner executed a pre-planned finish to the match that was known to all in the ring except Bret Hart.  Dubbed the Montreal Screwjob it's one of pro wrestling biggest backstage controversies that's sparked years of debate about who was right and who was wrong between wrestling fans.

Hart would eventually return to WWE after 12+ years away, reconciling his relationship with both the company and with Shawn Michaels in a public handshake on a televised RAW in Jan 2010.

The main feature is a 2 hour sit down interview with both Bret and Shawn with Jim Ross serving as the interviewer.  The first thing is this is about as close to a shoot interview you'll ever get from an official WWE release.  Shawn and Bret speak with inside perspective.  You hear a lot of wrestling terminology that probably more dedicated wrestling fans would be familiar with.  For exmaple Bret talks about dropping the title to Shawn and putting him over at Wrestlemania 12 and the planning of the match that occurred the morning it happened.  I'm not sure if WWE has ever allowed such an open perspective to any of it's DVD releases and it's pretty mind blowing to hear Bret and Shawn talk like that.

The meaty portion is both men discussing their real life feud and the cover a lot of topics...

* WM11 - Bret talks about how he felt Shawn turned himself babyface at the expense of Kevin Nash.

* WM12 - Bret goes over with how he wasn't happy with how  he was portrayed as champion heading into the match.  Also they go over Shawn telling Bret to ""get the F out of my ring"" at the end of the match and Hart storming out of the Anaheim Pond.

* Feb '97 - Both talk about Shawn dropping the WWF title w/out jobbing to anyone due to what most think was a fake knee injury.  The knee injury threw out plans for a Hart/Michaels WM13 main event.

* Bret talks about his disappointment at having to face Steve Austin instead of Michaels WM 13.

* They do talk briefly about the various promos they gave on TV and how it ended up with both men working themselves into a shoot.  Sunny Days is one of the more infamous promos from Michaels and it is mentioned but not really talked about in great detail.

* The angle where Shawn superkicked Bret in his wheelchair to close Raw and how it made things just a whole lot worse between the two.

* Montreal - the definite highlight of the interview.  They go over a lot of things like exactly why Bret refused to drop the title at the '97 Survivor Series, how the screwjob was planned out with Shawn and why he agreed to go along with it and whether Bret had a hint it was coming.

* The post Montreal years are touched briefly.  With Bret it's his WCW years, his stroke, hall of fame induction.  With Shawn it's his back injury suffered at the '98 Royal Rumble and 4 year retirement until returning to WWE in 2002 as an active performer.

* Than the reconciliation on Raw in Jan 2010 and how much of what they did in the ring was pre-planned.

* It closes with thoughts from both of what could've been had they handled the situation much better back than.

JR as the interviewer is awesome.  He doesn't show favoritism to either man and asks poignant questions to both at various times in the interview.

The only criticism I can think is Bret does most of the talking and Shawn stays silent quite a bit.  I suppose it's Shawn giving Bret his time to get burdens off his chest but I did wish Shawn chimed in a little more on a couple topics.

Another small negative is they do ""fast forward"" through certain portions of their careers to fit the 2 hour time frame, meaning they don't cover every single topic.  Off the top of my head they don't talk about...

* The backstage fight in 1997 where Bret ripped a clump of Shawn's hair.

* Summerslam '97 Bret vs Undertaker match.  The finish involved Bret spitting in Shawn's face.

* Booking Davey Boy Smith to drop the European Title to Shawn at One Night Only '97 in front of Bulldog's dying sister.

* Bret's contract situation in the months leading to Montreal (his 20 year contract that Vince McMahon wanted out of and his promised ""30 days of creative control over his Hitman character"")

* What finish was Bret expecting at Survivor Series '97.

* The post Montreal angles on Raw (the Bret Hart midget, Jim Neidhart joining DX for one night)

The way the interview is done it's geared towards the wrestling fans who are familiar with the history between the two men.  So if you're new or are a casual fan and just getting caught up on who Bret Hart was, than this would probably be a rental.  If you were a 90's kid who grew up watching Shawn and Bret every weekend on the old syndicated WWF shows, than this is highly recommended.  I'm not sure if it's the greatest WWE DVD release ever, but it ranks high up there because the Hart/Michaels reconciliation is one of the rare happy endings you'll find in pro wrestling.",1320019200,,5265,4.449895615866389
4650421,5,B005BYBZCM,"Before the days where the internet & social networking became a huge part of the media exposure in wrestling, there was rarely a feud in wrestling where the fans knew that not only was there tension between the two ""characters"" on screen but also exposed real life issues between the two men in real life.  This was possibly the biggest feud in the history of the business to happen under those same conditions with different stories & explanations of various events between the two men being told for years.  For the first time ever, the two men are face to face to finally tell the story together of everything that happened in-front & behind the scenes of their rivalry in Greatest Rivalries: Shawn Michaels vs. Bret Hart.  Now this is a completely different presentation than anything WWE has ever done before where it wasn't a documentary full of various clips & various people giving their opinions on the subject at hand.  This was Bret Hart & Shawn Michaels in the same room at the same time being interviewed by Jim Ross in regards to the history & issues between the two men with a small video package being highlighting the careers of both men before going into the different timelines being discussed.

The interview begins with both men talking about the start of their careers with their tag teams of The Hart Foundation & The Rockers with Bret telling his first impressions of Shawn, Shawn talking about how the talent of The Rockers saved their butts, what made the Hart Foundation different from other teams, the issues both men had with ""dinosaurs"", and memories of the infamous night that The Rockers beat The Hart Foundation for the tag team titles.  They move on to talk about the start of their singles careers & how important the Intercontinental Championship was to both men, their early friendship, and the moment Bret discovered they were in direct competition with each other.  WrestleMania XII was heavily discussed next as far as Bret's feelings on his title reign leading into the show, how Shawn started to play politics with ""The Kliq"", what was & wasn't planned that happened, and how everyone else started to read into things & create their own storylines off of things that weren't really there.  The issue of ""respect vs. trust"" was really the heart of soul of his conversation here as both men talking about Shawn ""losing his smile"", how they worked themselves into a ""shoot"" with their promos, how Bret telling Shawn to trust him led to the ""Sunny Days"" comments, and both men describing in detail about everything leading up to Survivor Series 1997 starting the one thing that Shawn said to Bret that began everything causing the entire screwjob to be setup as a ""mob hit.""  The aftermath of Montreal from Bret going to WCW & holding a grudge for such a long time caused him to ""lose his smile"" was discussed before going into how the Hart Dynasty & WrestleMania 25 helped him want to patch up his differences with Shawn before both men gave their feelings on the night they finally buried the hatchet on RAW & ending the conversation with their thoughts on finally making peace with each other.

DVD extras include both mens Hall Of Fame inductions & Bret's return to RAW in Jan. '10.  Blu-Ray extras also include bonus promos including a face to face interviews on RAW from Feb. '97, and two promos from May '97 with the significance of both of these two being discussed in the documentary.  Extra Interviews are also available on the Blu-Ray with both men discussing the setup behind the first Ladder Match, what the original plans were for SummerSlam '92, both men's thoughts on Bret winning the WWE Title for the first time & along with what Bret originally thought when Vince wanted to talk to him that morning he was winning it (I got a laugh out of it), Bret's thoughts on his time in WCW, and interview outtakes (some were funny).

Matches Include:
Rockers vs. Hart Foundation - Both teams where babyfaces here so the crowd was split between both teams. Rockers got the early advantage by using their speed before the Harts were able to recover & work for Shawn for a long time. This was a very athletic & heavily competitive match as each team had so many close near falls & got more aggressive as time went on to the point where the result didn't solve anything & had to have wrestlers come from the back to separate both teams.
""MSG"" Nov. '89
[Shawn Michaels: My Journey]

Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels - This singles match happened when both were members of their respective tag teams & even had their partners in their corners.  This match was short (around 5 mins.) but the chemistry between them was noticeable here as they were able to keep a pretty fast pace & did more action in this small time than some of the other top talents did in a longer time period.  The match really picked up when their tempters started to get hot as fist were flying with the tag partners getting hit causing them to get involved in the match.  This was more of a short preview for their later matches more than anything but a good TV match for that time.
""Wrestling Challenge"" Feb. '90

Hart Foundation vs. Rockers - This is a rare match from the Tokyo Dome in Japan that featured japanese commentary.  There were various stalemates early but clearly showcased both teams offense as time goes on the Rockers had more flashy moves & had the speed advantage while the Harts were the more aggressive & technical team.  Both teams did double teaming throughout the match such as Rockers making pinfall attempts on Niedhart after each tag trying to tire him out while the Harts would work over Shawn while the referee was distracted.  Very competitive match where it came down to that the losing team didn't get beat more than they got caught.
Mar. '91

Ladder Match: WWE Intercontinental Champion Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels - Two years before the more famous ladder match between Shawn & Razor Ramon would happen at WrestleMania, the very first ladder match in WWE history happened here.  Both men went away from their usual strategy in matches of wrestling & were brawling more with Sherri becoming a distraction from time to time.  The ladder was used as a weapon here with Shawn ramming it into Bret while Shawn was later given a slingshot into it.  It wasn't anywhere near the standards of this type of match today but the purpose here was just to show the concept of the match which it did achieve.
July '92
[The Ladder Match]

Intercontinental Champion Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels - They were evenly match causing Shawn to resort to tactics like pulling hair in order to keep Bret grounded before Bret was able to use Shawn's leverage against him to take him to the outside.  Both men showcased their technical skills as Bret went to work on Shawn's arm with an armbar & hammerlock while Shawn worked over Bret's back after whipping him hard into the corner & even caught Bret with a superkick right in the face as he was coming off the top ropes.  This was a good encounter that picked up the pace over time with a surprise ending.
Apr. '92

WWE Champion Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels - This one of those matches that have been classified as a ""lost classic"" because it's a high quality match that have gone down as one of the best in both mens careers but always gets overshadowed by other encounters that are more famous (or infamous) for one reason or another. This was the first singles match between both men on PPV, Shawn Michaels' first PPV main event, and for those Survivor Series historians...this was first of 3 times Bret & Shawn would face each other at this event but the second of 4 times they were involved in the same match & this match was exactly 5 years (give or take a few days) before the ""screwjob"". Shawn Michaels walked into this match as the Intercontinental Champion after defeating British Bulldog for the belt around a week earlier so the added story to this match was that Shawn had the advantage since he recently beat the man who Bret Hart at the previous PPV. This is a match that I can't describe as words wouldn't do it justice as they went around 30 mins. here in a classic performance that showcased the new era that WWE was going in where it was built on athleticism & wrestling. Again, a lost classic that made both men walk out with more credibility than they walked in with.
Survivor Series '92
[Greatest Wrestling Stars Of The 90's]

Steel Cage Match: Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels - With their rivalry renewed a month earlier during the elimination match at Survivor Series, they settled the score (for the time being) here in the cage.  Shawn attacked Bret right when he entered the cage & took some hard hits throughout the match such as the back of his head hitting the cage, being swung off the cage & crotch the ropes, and hurting his own knee stopping Shawn from escaping at one point.  Shawn took some punishment himself such as hanging off the top of the cage by his hair while Bret resorted to using the ring ropes to stop Shawn in way that every man felt it.  This wasn't a ""bloody massacre"" of a cage match but they put on a good performance (as usual).
Dec. '93

Iron Man Match: WWE Champion Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels - Just like they did the first Ladder Match, both men also did the very first Iron Man match in WWE history & for those who don't know the rules, the match has a 1 hour time limit & the man with the most decisions at the end of the time wins the match while it should be noted that Shawn created his own ""WrestleMania Moment"" before the match got started with his entrance.  Shawn worked a different style than expected with him grounding Bret with various takedowns while Bret used the same strategy by keeping Shawn down with headlocks before Shawn moved into working over the arm with armbars & a hammerlock.  Things started to pick up when Shawn caught Bret off guard with a head scissors that took him to the outside before attempting a Sweet Chin Music that missed Bret & knocked out someone else before returning to working over Bret's shoulder with various holds & even using the ringpost multiple times as Shawn kept trading his offensive style from the high flying with a crossbody onto Bret on the outside to grounded wrestling with the Perfect-Plex.  Bret started to get more aggressive with his offense like the coming off the top rope with a knee into Shawn's head & started focusing on his back after the backdrop over the post onto the outside with moves like the backbreaker, back suplex from the top rope, and throwing Shawn into the corner so hard that he went over the top rope & his Jose on the outside.  Both men started showing signs of the exhaustion as the match kept going as Bret beat on Shawn until he was out of breath before both men started pulling out all the stops like Bret's suicide dive onto the outside & Shawn executing separate moonsaults & head scissors off the top rope.  The final moments were very intense while everything that also happened after we heard a bell was controversial in it's own right but it doesn't take away that these two men delivered a quality performance.
WrestleMania XII
[From The Vault: Shawn Michaels; History Of The WWE Championship]

(Blu-Ray) WWE Champion Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels - 18 months in the making with the special conditions that this was to be one on one with no outside interference with Shawn ""being Shawn"" on the way to the ring & completely disrespecting the Canadian flag.  This was going to be a war & you could tell that right away as they had a match before the actual match got started.  Both men started brawling everywhere with the fans getting their punches in at Shawn in the crowd, both men being thrown into the steps & ringpost while also being choked with flags, backstage referees & officials like Pat Patterson getting hit for getting in the way of these two, and Bret trying to break Shawn's leg with the figure four around the post like he did months earlier.  However, it was the final moment of this match & what happened afterwords that will always have this moment live on as the ""Montreal Screwjob.""
Survivor Series '97
[Best Of Confidental]

This was a very unique WWE presentation that finally gave the fans a more overall sense of everything going on & also a bit more closure in terms of the rivalry between these two.  Although normally I don't have a heavy amount of DVD repeats on sets, this is a chronicle of their feud against each other so it was welcomed here but I would have suggested adding the 2 Out Of 3 Falls match here over their Madison Square Garden tag match since they actually discussed that match instead of the MSG one while moving the some of the repeats to the Blu-Ray & keeping the ""Screwjob"" & other bonus materials on the regular edition.  In the end, this is something I would like to see future installments of when it comes to other famous feuds in history so I would definitely go out of your way to get.",1319932800,2,12967,4.569827586206896
4650422,5,B005BYBZCM,"Bret Has Been My Role Model & Fav. Since 1990. The guy is a hero to me. Shawn is a great wrestler and performer. We all know about this rivalry if you watch WWE back in the 90s. Anything regarding Bret, I usually purchase and I just finish watching the 1st disc of this DVD and it was very emotional. It put tears into my eyes. To see what Bret had to go through and what Shawn had to do for the business. I already know how great the matches are. I definitely recommend this DVD to anyone !!!",1319846400,,493,3.98989898989899
4650423,5,B005BYBZCM,"well this is the best wwe dvd ever in my opinion and i agree with everybody posting here but i notice that both wrestlers shawn and bret and jr skip somethings that happend for example both wrestlers they never talk about the fight they had in the locker room  when shawn talk about sunny days and bret confront shawn in the locker about that and thats when both had a scuffle and bret manage to pull some hair of shawn michaels and bret saying i got precious hair of shawn michaels in my hand this was told by bret in his book and also another thing they skip is if bret really had sex with sunny jr skip that knowing the talk was about sunny but jr skip that question, another question skip is why shawn never let jose lotario enter the ring to celebrate his victory in mania 12 also i discover that both shawn and bret lie about some questions but despite that is a 5 star dvd i recommend it",1319846400,,894,4.167630057803469
4650424,4,B005BYBZCM,"The main interview/documentary is great, no complaints there.  My only few complaints is that one, how in the world did they manage to mess up the commentary on the Survivor Series 1992 match?  You can hardly hear McMahon and Heenan, they're so muted...it's one of my favorite matches ever, and to have the audio messed up on it is really disappointing.  The only other complaint is the match selection, they should have included the tag match which the Rockers won the tag titles at (they talk about it in the interview).  Why leave it out?  Why not include the 1993 Survivor Series match?  Could have made this just that much better.",1319760000,,635,4.675675675675675
4650425,5,B005BYBZCM,"Shawn Michaels vs. Bret Hart: WWE's Greatest Rivalries. What more do you need to say than that? These two really had something special together in the ring that kept viewers glued to their tv's. Their rivalry came when the ""muscle heads"" were on their way out or at least getting out of the Title picture. Bret & Shawn proved that you don't have to be a big man to be a World Champion.

When these two spoke, I really felt their anger and bitterness toward each other and when you are able to generate that, whether it's real or worked, you have a great rivalry.

The interview is one of the best interviews I have ever seen or heard. I really can't say anymore beyond that. You just have to see it as it is worth the price alone!

4650427,5,B005BYBZCM,"'WWE: Greatest Rivalries - Shawn Michaels vs. Bret Hart' is a great documentary that is highlighted by a candid, honest 2 hour interview segment with both of these legends side by side.  There's not a lot new here for smart fans that know the whole story, but it's great to hear it coming from Hart and Michaels themselves.  There is plenty of emotion in their answers, and not much is ignored in the process.  The one thing that was new to me is that even up until 1996 the two men admit they were still friends and had respect for each other.  It wasn't until 1997 that things really took things for a bad turn, and the fault is on both men's shoulders.  I wish a little more focus had been put on subjects like WM13 and the rematch that never happened, Owen Hart's death, and the ""Sunny Days"" comment that Michaels made, but this last topic was touched on and basically it was said without being said that the comment was real and legit.

With these WWE discs, the matches presented are never the total package that you want to see.  They do this so you have to buy multiple discs if you want all the content you are interested in.  The focus is and should be the main interview segment.  WWE notoriously puts out a lot of mediocre/substandard documentaries, but this is one of the few that is worth buying.  If you want to learn more about these 2 legends or just enjoy the surreal process of seeing them sitting next to each other, you can't go wrong picking this up.

***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1319587200,,1498,4.391304347826087
4650428,4,B005BYBZCM,"I went into this DVD set with a lot of hope and promise that this was going to be the greatest thing ever produced by World Wrestling Entertainment.

Honestly, it was a little overhyped.

Now, that's not to say it's bad, because it's not by any stretch of the imagination. But at the same time, it didn't deliver in some areas.

If you're like me, you weren't watching in the '90s (I personally started watching in 2001) so you are unfamiliar with some of what's talked about. You know about the whole Montreal screwjob (because WWE still tries/succeeds in making money off of it) but you don't know much else about what was going on. This set does debunk a lot of the myths about the real relationship between Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels and does it very well. For me, I'm not a big fan of all the pomp and circumstance that WWE provides and this DVD was a breath of fresh air as it was right to the point- here are Bret and Shawn and they're going to tell you what's up. That's great. I love it. Keep it up. At the same time, it was promoted that this DVD would be ""riveting"" and ""controversial"" and ""emotional"" and I suppose it is, but it falls flat in the controversy and emotion areas. There is nothing controversial about it. Bret didn't say anything that Shawn disagreed with and vice versa, no one said anything that made the other one angry and they started fighting in the middle of the interview. As far as emotion goes, if you've seen ""The Best There Is, The Best There Was, The Best There Ever Will Be"" and ""Heartbreak and Triumph"", then you've seen all of the emotion that you're going to get out of these two. The only really emotional part was at the end when they talk about reconsiliation.

The real sticking point for me was that it seemed to be all about Bret Hart telling his side of things. Shawn really didn't get involved enough for me to think that this was that big of an issue where he needed to explain his side of things. We all know about Shawns past and his spiritual healing and he has held himself accountable for his part in all of that. This DVD felt like it was Bret's turn to be accountable for his part in it as he was still somewhat upset when he made his DVD and didn't really explain it in depth like he does here.

Now, is the product worth buying? Yes, it absolutely is. Especially if you're a fan of both of these performers like I am.

But is it the greatest DVD set ever made by the WWE and nothing before or after will ever be as good?

No, it isn't. 4 stars was generous, but 3 stars was too harsh.",1319587200,,2547,4.25
4650429,1,B005BYBZCM,"This set is one of those dream sets wrestling fans had been waiting for. And, if this had been released as a one disc set, containing only the interview segment on disc one, it would have definitely been a 5 star release.

But, that didn't happen. and WWE Home Video released a half-assed set that isn't worth buying.

First off, the back of the set says it has ""approximately 9 hours"" of content. If by ""approximately"", they mean 7 hours of content, then that's 100% correct. The discs run 2 hours for disc one, two hours for disc 2, and 3 hours for the mostly worthless disc 3.

And the content of discs 2 and 3 is why I rated the set so low. In the documentary, they take quite a few minutes to discuss a match between the Hart Foundation and the Rockers from Saturday Night's Main Event where the Rockers won the WWF Tag Team championship, but the match was never aired for various reasons. Wouldn't it have been nice to see that match on this set? Well, you won't. WWE didn't feel it necessary to include it in the extra hour of blank space on disc 2.

And the biggest problem... if you buy the regular DVD version of this set, the infamous Montreal Screwjob match isn't included anywhere on the set. Let me repeat that, in bigger type... THE MONTREAL SCREWJOB MATCH ISN'T ON THE REGULAR DVD VERSION OF THIS SET. In fact, nothing from the most important year of the Bret/Shawn rivalry, 1997, is included on the regular DVD version of the set. Disc 3 skips from the Wrestlemania 12 Iron Man match directly to pointless Hall of Fame inductions. Now, call me crazy, but wouldn't you think that some of the important moments discussed in the interview segment, like the ""Sunny Days"" promo, or the Montreal match, sould be included on the DVD? Well, they're not. In fact, most of Disc 3 is eaten up with pointless Hall of Fame inductions, when the disc space could have been better used for more matches and promos from the Bret and Shawn feud of 1997.

Oh, sure, you can get these promos, and the screwjob match itself as exclusives if you buy the Blu-Ray version of the set. But, if you don't have a Blu-Ray player, or just don't want to buy the Blu-Ray version of the set, you're screwed like Bret in Montral.

Bottom line... disc 1, the interview segment, is worth watching if you're any type of wrestling fan. Bret and Shawn are mostly honest, explode some myths, and finally put the specter of Montreal to rest. The interview is what Attitude Era WWF fans have been waiting for, and is most definitely worth watching. And the matches included on disc 2 are very good, and belong on the set. But, there was space for more, and what's lacking is almost as important as what's on the set.  And that's the reason this set isn't worth buying. Wait until it's out on Netflix or Amazon Prime for streaming, or buy it from some third party seller for under 5 bucks... but don't waste your money on this horribly produced DVD set.",1319587200,10,2927,4.439478584729981
