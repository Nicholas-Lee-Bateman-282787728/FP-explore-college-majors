3682753,5,B001L9EXNE,"This is one of the few movies he will actually watch all the way through! We have a Jeep and he loves to go ""Jeepin'"" and he loves going to the airport, so best of both worlds!  Love it!",1267833600,,186,3.769230769230769
3682754,5,B001L9EXNE,"My 3 year old son loves this story. It is an original story that is engaging even for adults. The animation is very good, of course it wasn't done with a Pixar type budget but it still is quite good. It is a fun story with some music and teaches a kid not to give up on your dream and to realize that when dreams come true that they may not be exactly what you imagined.",1265500800,5,370,3.8815789473684212
3682755,1,B001L9EXNE,Lame story line and whoever edited the music video at the end should have paid more attention to keeping the backup singer's skirt down and kept in mind this is supposed to be a childrens video,1264464000,,193,4.388888888888889

3682761,5,B001L9EXNE,"This is a really cute movie for kids,my little Grandkids love it. It shows that your dreams can come true,maybe not 100%,
But by adapting to your abilities you can come close. If you love old Jeeps or have a Jeep,You and you're Children will enjoy this movie.",1395878400,,259,4.416666666666667
3682762,4,B001L9EXNE,"nice show, kids enjoyed it. more for younger kids ages 7 and younger but enjoyable even for adults to watch.",1391731200,,108,4.45
3682763,5,B001L9EXNE,"I gave this, along with a fleece ""Tugger"" blanket to my great nephew (age 2) and really liked it and watched it often.",1385769600,,118,4.173913043478261
3682764,5,B001L9EXNE,This movie has the grandchildren glue to there sit. The boys relate to it as they have dreams of flying. The ending is sweet.,1385510400,,125,4.25
3682765,3,B001L9EXNE,"My 3 year old grandson loves jeeps, so I thought he would enjoy this movie. However, it did not keep his attention.",1379894400,,115,4.2727272727272725
3682775,4,B001L9EXNE,"Great movie to get my son into learning about Jeeps.

Just try to ignore the Christian overtones and let your kids enjoy the movie.

My son watched it a few time, so he must have liked it.",1366156800,,188,4.054054054054054
3682776,5,B001L9EXNE,"i bought tugger for my son as a new born and it was the first animated movie he watched. Now, at 4 1/2 he still loves the movie even with the glitch it has developed in the middle due to a scratch from MANY ""miles"" of playing. I myself, a jeep enthusiast love this movie so i'm gonna buy a few more so i got some backup copies!!!! it's a great story for kids showing them that they should never give up on their dreams and the importance of true friendship and adventure. My son is now a jeep lover himself and loves the rare sight of a chance to see a ""real"" tugger and usually spots them before me and yells out ""there is a jeep willys just like Tugger!!!!!",1365897600,,659,4.038167938931298
3682777,3,B001L9EXNE,"My 3 year old loves loves loves Jeeps.  My older son wrote a Santa letter for him and asked for a Jeep movie of all things, so I found Tugger.  It was okay.  He watched it once and got distracted, and never asked for it again.  I'm sure he will watch it again, but it is a little slow or maybe too long for a little one.  It fit the bill for the Santa gift though.",1356912000,,364,3.736842105263158
3682778,5,B001L9EXNE,"Since this movie was for my son, I rated it 5 out of 5.  The animation leaves much to be desired, but my 4-year-old loves it!  The story is cute, which also helps make up for the animation's shortcomings.",1356134400,,204,4.205128205128205
3682779,4,B001L9EXNE,I felt the artwork was really done well.  Most everyone dreams of flying and this little jeep displayed his desire to fly by being persistent.  Everyone needs to set their goals high and work toward achieving them regardless of negative stumbling blocks.,1327881600,,254,5.023809523809524
3682780,5,B001L9EXNE,"My 3 year old grandson loves this movie, he never tires from watching it. I have watched it with him and it is and awesome show.",1323388800,2,128,3.9615384615384617
3682781,2,B001L9EXNE,"Let me add a dose of reality to the reviews. This is a very low-budget production. The storyline is more predictable than most kid movies, and the CGI quality dates back to the early days of CGI. The graphics bears no resemblance to Pixar, Dreamworks, or Disney productions. See for yourself, watch the trailer at [...]
While our 3-year old likes the movie (our 4-year old doesn't), and we have not warmed up to it after seeing it too many times to count. Usually, we can appreciate a movie after watching it numerous times (like ""Over the Hedge"" or ""Open Season""), but not so with Tugger. It's just not well written and the graphics are too dated to enjoy.",1321833600,2,657,4.529411764705882
3682782,5,B001L9EXNE,DVD is a great gift for anyone who loves to fly or dreams to.  Kids of all ages will enjoy this.  History buff will love the Willys Jeep.,1288483200,,137,3.857142857142857
3682783,5,B001L9EXNE,"Grandchildren ages 2,3 and 4, parents, including dad in Marine Corp, and grandparents, alike. all loved this movie...
A best kept secret.  I highly recommend.",1271116800,6,158,5.32
3682784,5,B001L9EXNE,"Tuggo is what my 22 month old calls Tugger. We also discovered it on Netflix instant streaming and it had everything this boy loves, trucks, planes, crashes and music. The first time he watched it and Tugger crashes he got real quiet, turned around and looked at my husband and I and sadly said, ""Tuggo Crash."" It was so cute. I finally came online to find a copy. Any little one who is into anything with wheels will like this movie. While I admit it isn't on my top favorites it is definitely one of his, and since it's a kids movie that's how it's supposed to be. I highly recommend this movie for any little boy. (or girl if she likes trucks, my daughter seems indifferent, but maybe it's bc she's only 10 months). If your kid likes CARS, then they would most likely like Tugger.",1269216000,4,783,4.333333333333333

8317701,4,B001L9EXNE,We gifted this to our nephew for Christmas. He loved it but his parents thought it was obnoxious. I haven't personally watched but they've encouraged me to experience it for myself.,1427414400,,181,4.870967741935484

8317704,5,B001L9EXNE,"Very cute cartoon about a jeep that had dreams to fly and never gave up on pursuing a rather bizarre and what appears to be an unattainable dream.. Or is it?

I own a 1976 cj7 jeep.. Not quite a 1941 MB willys but still in the same family..

And your family will enjoy this sweet, simple and unique story..

Now, I'm waiting for a story about a cj7 jeep... ;)",1421193600,,359,4.028169014084507
