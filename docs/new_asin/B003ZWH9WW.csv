I've watched many wrestling videos and he does an excellent job covering various techniques.

I highly recommend this video series for anyone patient enough to watch.",1424822400,,247,5.3076923076923075
8411148,5,B003ZWH9WW,"Purchased this series for a young man who wrestles every year in high school. He viewed the video series. Next thing I know, he invited his wrestling buddies over to view the videos. (BIG HINT) When I asked him how he liked the videos he said, ""Yeah, they are really fun and I actually learned some new moves!"" There you have it folks. A fun, instructional video that a wrestler is willing to share with his high school buddies and that actually taught hit something! Pin!",1370044800,,472,4.5
