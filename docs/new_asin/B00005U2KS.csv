1663800,5,B00005U2KS,"Although all six episodes in this series are good, only three are really exceptional and will go down in ""AbFab"" history as classics.  They are: ""Paris"" (the girls go on a vacation to Paris- Edina and Saffy actually bond, if you can believe that! It's very touching, almost!); ""Small Openings"" (Saffy writes a ""Mommie Dearest""-esque play that Edina and Pats initially object to, but then later become friends with the people that play them!  Patsy, incidentally, is played by a man!); and ""Menopause"" (Patsy's bones become very brittle and start breaking.  Edina and Saffy's reactions when Patsy gives herself a shot of pain medication is BRILLIANTLY HILARIOUS!).
Lots of extras here: the ""Mirrorball"" special that features all of the main ""AbFab"" actors in different roles (not as funny as ""AbFab"" but still well worth your time); great commentary from Jennifer Saunders; photo gallery; outtakes/bloopers, etc.  My only complaint, and it's minor, is that the ""Who's Who Guide to the stars of AbFab"" is a bit hard to read.  It looks like handwriting on a piece of graph paper- and even on my gigantic television, it was a bit hard to make all of the writing out.  They should have just used a font that was easier to read.
The DVD's come packaged in a plastic case, unlike the last set that came in a cardboard case.  The plastic is a lot better and durable than the cardboard, so this is good!  The design elements of the case are the same as the last set (it's just a different color), so at least the two sets basically match when they sit on a shelf together.  It's so annoying when things in a series aren't designed likewise, so it's nice to see that Warner Bros./BBC Video did this correctly!
Oddity: all of the extras appear on both DVD's.  This is not a complaint, I just thought it was sort of strange that they are repeated within the same set.
And no... ""The Last Shout"" does not appear on this DVD set.  The rights to that are owned by a different company, hence the reason why that's not out on DVD yet.
Edina, Patsy, and Saffy are just as fab as ever!  Hopefully there will be another series of episodes soon!",1013558400,53,2124,4.58994708994709
1663801,5,B00005U2KS,"What is amazing about AbFab is how well it picks up after being off the air for so many seasons. The writing is fresh and lean, and it seems that there are more jibes against Edwina than there used to be. The show is delicious and mean, and they have rarely held back in their humor. It works on so many levels, and the new episodes have some scenes that I needed to play over a few times because they were hysterically toxic.
The added features are also delicious and fattening. The 4th season DVD is packed to the gills with fun, and makes the complete series DVD seem pale with its special features. This is definitely worth having, especially since it appears the AbFab ladies will probably return with more nastiness next season.",1012953600,,734,4.485074626865671
1663802,4,B00005U2KS,"Though it is delightful to have Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley back in our homes for another go-round of boozing, bitching and brawling with Saffron, the magic that was the first 3 seasons of ABFAB is not here.
I would have to second Thomas Pease's observation that perhaps these episodes would've been better left in the can or on the shelf. It's not that amusing moments go missing, but that the sharp wit and punchy satire on everything ""now"" in modern society (fashion, sex, and shopping, and oh yes, the Internet) have been played before in the first seasons, and with greater pleasure by Saunders and Lumley. It's almost that the party has been over for days, and someone forgot to wake the girls from their latest hangover.
All the same they're having more fun here in these six vignettes than most American sitcoms have in entire seasons, if the current domestic TV climate is any indication...",1012435200,4,907,4.7834394904458595
1663803,5,B00005U2KS,"Ab Fab was one of the funniest shows on tv, and that hasn't changed. Maybe it's just me, but these newer episodes aren't as fabulous as the older ones on the 4 DVD set. Maybe they've just had to tone things down a bit, some of the magic is gone. But, these sweeties are still something to be cherished and enjoyed. The price is right for this box set and there are some great goodies to be owned as well. The only thing I wish they had added was ""The Final Shout"". Anyway, this is still a solid buy for the bad girl in all of us.",1012262400,3,529,3.953271028037383
1663804,4,B00005U2KS,"I love that Jennifer Saunders decided to bring back Eds and Pats- but I wish she had kept most of these scripts as warm-ups.  They don't quite jell, although they do get better as the season goes on.  I do like that the the relationship between Saffy and ""Titticaca"" has started to mirror Eddie and Pats in a delightfully twisted way, and there are some great cameos from Fleur, Bo, and the various ex-husbands.  But some of the jokes fall really flat- it seems at best disingenuous (and at worst, dysmorphic) for someone as pretty as Ms. Saunders to keep referring to herself as fat and ugly; a lot of the Saffron jokes are not really as funny now that Julia Sawahla has gained weight, and the jokes about Patsy are not as funny now that Joanna Lumley has started to look a bit old. (but that could be me)
There will be at least two more seasons coming, so I would see if A) they scripts improve, and B) if they release a boxed set.  But if you have not gotten the original boxed set of the first three seasons, by all means get the deal that Amazon is offering; the set of the 1st three seasons is a gem, and the inclusion of ""Mirrorball"" on this disc, and getting basically for free, is too great to pass up.",1011744000,10,1211,4.252173913043478

Edina & Patsy are the life of the party. Edina also has a disapproving daughter named Saffron, a whacky assistant Bubble, and lets not forget Edina's Mom. This show basically follows the fun & fashionable lives of Edina & Patsy. Episodes in season 4 are: Parralox, Fish farm, Paris, Donkey, Small Opening, & Menopause. This season was from 2001, and it comments on what is going on in the world such as Parralox. Episode parralox is poking fun at the botox craze of the time. This show is fun, and funny.

I think the excesses and ego of the two leads wears a little more as time goes on.  The cast is top notch I think Jane Horrocks is a genius and we see too little of her in the States (watch the movie Little Voice for one example) and Julia Sawalha grew up ding Ab Fab and you can see her here in Candleford, Cranford, Pride & Prejudice, etc.).

1664200,5,B00005U2KS,"Well, I like British humor (except for Benny Hill, which is too slapsticky for me). I enjoy the clever dialog, but there are a lot of sight-gags and physical humor in ""Ab-Fab,"" as it is known across the pond.

If you take the most outrageous skits from Monty Python, and turn it up to eleven, you get the level of humor in these shows. They are pretty raunchy, but it is mostly in the characters attitudes towards drugs and sex. The humor is adult, but there is nothing really ""blue"" by American sensibilities.",1374624000,,510,4.483870967741935

1664267,5,B00005U2KS,"After ""Absolutely Fabulous"" went off the air in 1996 there was an outcry from its hardcore fanbase to bring the series back to television. This was due in part to its tremendous success in Britain as well as its North American audience who discovered Edina, Patsy, Bubble, Saffy, and their cohorts via different cable channels who bought the series during the mid to late nineties. In this tremendous and beautiful boxset ""Ab Fabs'"" six episodes from its fourth season are here to view in all their wonderful glory and enjoyment and the girls have never looked better or acted more wicked! Highlights are the episode entitled ""Paris"" where the girls go to France as Patsy has a photo shoot and Saffy tags along to go sightseeing; in ""Donkey"" Edina tries to lose weight again with terrible results; and finally in ""Small Opening"" Saffy has written a tell-all play about her life with her mother and her mom's alcoholic friend! Among the bonus features are 12 minutes of outtakes, commentary by Jennifer Saunders and producer Jon Plowman, the original pilot episode ""Mirrorball"" is included (the first time it has been available on DVD) and much more.

1664273,4,B00005U2KS,"After a hiatus, the Ab Fab team wanted to do something.  What came out of this was an pilot called Mirrorball.  But then they decided that they had not finished with their Ab Fab characters. They decided to make six more episodes.

Disc 1:

Parralox - This is their take off on the Botox rage.  Patsy has found a more potent version of Botox called Parralox and has had injections.  Edina is to appear on AM TV and Patsy thinks that she should get some injections to make her look better on TV.  In a drunken state Patsy injects Edina to their usual disastrous results.

Fish Farm - Saffy is having the back garden redone and has hired a young cute landscape architect (Crispan Bonham Carter).  It turns out that he is younger brother of an old friend of the girls and he has the hots for Edina.  Edina sees marrying him and moving to his family's country estate.

Paris - The gang goes over to Paris for a fashion shoot.  Edina and Saffy for a mother daughter piece and Patsy for a former model shoot.  But Saffy wants to see Paris forces Edina to see her Paris.  But this of course doesn't work out and Saffy gives in to her mother and finds a way to bond with her by seeing Edina's Paris. This is one of the best episodes of the series.

Donkey - Edina goes on a diet to slim herself when at a dinner party, the girls say she uses her fat to be a crutch.  This is another great episode with great style and unexpected depth.

Disc 2:

Small Opening - Saffy's play gets produced at a small West End theatre.  But everyone is hiding the fact that it is an autobiographical play.

Menopause - This is a another final episode for the series.  Patsy is suffering from low bone density because at ""42"" she has gone through menopause.  Therefore, Saffy sets up a Menopause Anonymous meeting at the house.  Edina's business is once again going under do to a blunder by Bubble.  This episode has another hilarious visit by Mo Gaffney.

DVD EXTRAS -

Episode Commentary by Jennifer Saunders and producer Jon Plowman

Disc 2 -

Who's Who - Cast Bios, Again

Let's Get Celebritied Up - Bios on the guest cast

Absolutely Confused - For those that are impaired on anything British including who the Spice Girls are, this will clarify things like who the Prime Minister of Britain is.

Before Ab Fab - Two French and Saunders sketches. The first is about two editors putting together a frivolous women's magazine.  The second is a take off of Silence of the Lambs with Jennifer as Clarisse and Dawn as Hannibal.

Joanna Lumley Talks About Modeling - A two minute interview Joanna did when she was a model in the early sixties.

Mirrorball Special - Well the cast is back together but this time they are struggling actors and singers.  Vivienne (Jennifer) has had one role in the last five years and that was for a commercial.  Her daughter, Freda (Julia) is currently rehearsing Hedda Gabbler.  Jackie (Joanna) is Vivienne's best friend and a faded disco diva looking for a comeback.  Vivienne has a chance for the lead in the musical version of Angela's Ashes and let's see how the girls screw it up.  Also appearing is Jane Horrocks as a Swedish bar maid who is also auditioning for the show and June Whitfield as Dora Vermouth a faded actress who has been touring with the same show for fifty years going from the star to the star's mother to interesting old lady.  This is only mildly funny and you can see why the next year they decided to do Ab Fab 4.

1664297,5,B00005U2KS,"ABFAB as some of us fans call it is quite possibly one of the zaniest, craziest, sickest shows to come out of Britain to date. The premise is simple. There's Edwina (Eddie), her friend Patsy and Eddie's daughter Saffron (Saffi). Eddie is an overweight, immature, compulsive, undersexed, selfish, fashion misfit who worships LaCroix and everything he designs. Patsy is a drunken, non-working, oversexed, chain smoking, spend thrift, fashionista, self-centered, alcoholic, leach. She's also Eddie's best friend. Saffi is the plain jane, level headed, smart, prudish, straight laced dauther of Eddie and her father who happens to be gay has left her mother for a gay black man.

Poor Saffi even though the child of the house more often than not has to be the adult of the house. She fixes her mom breakfast when she comes in from a hard night of boozing and partying with Patsy. Patsy and Saffi hate each other and continually snipe at each other.

Aside from storylines, ABFAB is very difficult to describe because many of the funniest bits are visual. You have to see and hear everything. One funny episode has Saffi off to college for the first time. Eddie tries to guilt her into staying home but it doesn't work. That morning Eddie drives to the college and barges her way into Saffi's class with a can of something and a can opener and asks Saffi to open the can for her because she doesn't know how to work the can opener. Madness. It's very funny.

You should watch all of the episodes because there's not a bit of sanity in any of them. You've got to have this!

Not suitable for young children though. It's barely suitable for grown ups!",1132185600,,1644,4.697916666666667

But with that said, even a lame Ab Fab season is better than none at all!",1123718400,3,361,4.1571428571428575
1664299,5,B00005U2KS,"I couldn't think of a better title. lol.

Anyway, I don't know why people don't like this season. I actually think it's the best season. It has some of the best episodes. The first three seasons were great, but I still like the fourth better. I bought this DVD mainly because it had a lot of cool extras (this is the only series I own of Ab Fab).

Here's an episode overview:

1)Parralox- Patsy gets parralox and pressures Edina into getting it as well so she'll look good on TV when she goes on Richard and Judy with Twiggy. Saffy tries to get a New Labor job. It's not one of my favorite episodes, but it's got some great parts (I don't understand the whole exchange between Candy and that other girl in the club, even after watching it with the commentary.) Anyway, pretty good episode. 8/10

2)Fish Farm- This isn't one of my favorite episodes, but it does have some good gags in it. Edina finally goes on a date again with a supposed wealthy person, but a shocking (to them) secret is revealed. 7/10

3)Paris- Patsy begins her modeling career again for a special photo shoot of young and old models as well as a mother and daughter shoot. Saffy, Edina, and Bubble join Patsy on her way to Paris. The relationship between Edina and Saffy begins to blossom, but Edina's idea of sight seeing does something that causes a riff between them again. A hilarious episode. 9/10

4)Donkey- A Sex and the City-type episode. It begins with a usual dinner with Edina and her friends and Edina is told that she's too fat. Determined to be the fast racehorse and not the donkey, she engages in an exercise program and gives up booze. But sometimes things don't always work out. Absolutely hilarious episode. 10/10

5)Small Opening- Saffy's written a play about her life and Edina is horrified at what kind of play Saffy's written, and just HOW fat is the actress playing her? This is definitely one of the best episodes in the whole show's history. I love this episode and I'm so glad that I have the chance to watch it whenever I want to now. 10/10

6)Menopause- I'm just gonna write what's on the back of the DVD because I don't know how to describe this fantastic epiosde. Womb prayers echo all around the house as Eddy and Patsy join Menopausals Anonymous. While Edina rails against the group hugs, a new, altogether fluffier Patsy is about to emerge...

I absolutely love this episode. With a peek into the future life of Edina and Patsy as old women, another great episode from Series 4. 10/10

EXTRAS: Commentary by Jen Saunders and Jon Plowman on all 6 episodes (hilarious); Mirrorball special featuring the original cast in different characters (Jane Horrocks is HILARIOUS in this); Outtakes; Photo Gallery; a Who's Who guide to the cast, the celebrity guests, and the various references made throughout Series 4; two sketches from French and Saunders that started the whole show of Ab Fab (""Modern Mother and Daughter"" and ""Woman's World"", hilarious stuff); and a clip from 1967 with Joanna Lumley talking about modeling (a very interesting clip)

SOmething is missing from the usual bawdy, unapolgetic humor. Still it is funny enough but not as memorable as the first 3 seasons.",1106265600,,270,4.313725490196078
1664301,5,B00005U2KS,"Well, being a religious watcher of Ab Fab since the beginning, series 4 really doesnt stand up to the orginal 3 series.  But i totally understand why. It was quite a long break the producers took b/t series 3 and 4.  But don't get me wrong, series 4 is a delightful season.  I love it! I am giving it 5 stars because of the humor, the characters, the dvd extras, and just because it is Ab Fab.  Here is a brief episode guide:

1.  Parralox- Edina has started a new TV production company.  Patsy has taken up parrlox injections to preserve her ""beauty"".  And Saffy is applying for a New Labour job.  Its a good start for a good season.

2.  Fish Farm- Edina and Patsy return from a Marilyn Manson concert.  And Edina finds that her new male gardener is quite a catch.  See what happens!!

3.  Paris-  The gang goes to Paris for a fashion shoot that Patsy is going to be in.  Edina and Saffy go on an all out tour de paris.  And Patsy just cant seem to get her 60's fashion poses out of her.

4.  Donkey-  Once again, poor Edina needs to lose weight.  She bites the bullet and starts a new excersise program.  Will she be skinny enough to be called Sarah Jessica Parker?!

5.  Small Opening-  My favorite episode from series 4.  Saffy is making a play about her life and doesnt want Edina to know.  But once Edina finds out...well, you'll just have to see what happens.  A great story line!!

6.  Menopause-  The last episode in series 4.  Edina is worried that she may have menopause, so Saffy forces her into a menopause anonymous group...in her living room!!!

This ability is rare, as she brings each individuals' experience into each scene, and the continuity is exemplary! One feels that one is pulled into the comedy as if one were part of the action.
Strangely, however, this didn't go over as well in England as it did here in the United States. Jennifer deserves national exposure for her brilliant work. Her work is a 10 on the comedic richter scale. In a word: genius !",1076457600,,759,4.62962962962963

1664306,4,B00005U2KS,"A fantastic attirbute t this series is that is has been going for over ten years, and in BRistish Comedy, this is a true feat!
The jokes have worn a little thin, and Saffy seems to have become some kind of paranoid shadow of herself - however the episode where she writes her own play - which steals jokes from previous series episodes is hysterial, particualry as Patsy is played by a drag queen! The series is a must for all fans. The big plus is that it introduces new ideas for series five - which I am lucky enough to be watching in the UK at the moment. Series 5 is back to the roots and is far funnier than any of the other series put together. Eddie is about to be a Granny! The best jokes are here, and the most funniest visual gags make the next series the one to own and watch over and over again. But you need series four and the Christmas special ""Gay"" to make sense of the new direction the characters take. Hats off to you guys for turning what could have been a national disaster into one of the funniest comedy moments of 2004!!!",1067472000,4,1046,4.157635467980295
1664307,5,B00005U2KS,"After an absence of five years from our televisions, Jennifer Saunders brought her internationally famous, multiple-award winning British sitcom, Absolutely Fabulous, back to millions of loyal viewers. The show was instantly welcomed back by the BBC, who broadcast the entire six episodes in late 2001. The ratings weren't as high as earlier series where 12 million tuned in regularly, but still enough to be considered a tremendous success in the UK. Series 4 is noticeably not as funny as the first three series, but still funny enough to be considered Ab Fab classics.

Series 4 opens with the rather disappointing ""Parralox."" Eddy is due to appear on Richard and Judy in a few days, and she's ecstatic. If only she could get rid of all those wrinkles on her face - Patsy has just the thing in illegal injections! As the first episode of this new series, this episode doesn't seem to have a point and never really gets to its objective before it ends, resulting in a rather lifeless episode. This said, the episode does have some great bits with guest stars including Michael Greco, Stephen Gately and Richard and Judy, but it isn't up to the quality standards such as the Series 2 opener, ""Hospital."" The next episode is the brilliant ""Fish Farm."" Eddy and Patsy arrive home from a Marilyn Manson concert in their mosher gear. These first few minutes have some hilarious gags, which are some of the best in the show's history. Also, Eddy discovers she has a garden attached to her house and Saffy wants it re-designed. Expect Eddy trying desperately to impress the sexy gardener, but going too far, resulting in disastrous consequences such as inflatable bras!

""Paris"" is another classic episode. Eddy and Patsy are due in Paris for a fashion-shoot, to which Saffy hesitantly agrees to attend. While Patsy struggles to figure out how to pose for pictures in the modern world, Eddy takes Saffy sight-seeing around Paris. But just how long will Saffy survive when she agrees to do things her mother's way in Paris? Especially when they take a trip to the top of the Eiffel Tower!  In the great episode ""Donkey,"" Eddy is desperate to lose weight to impress her friends. She goes on a strict diet routine, and discovers she has a muscle in her arm! She's doing great and looks rather stunning on her final night out. She's really impressed with herself, until she makes the remark that she looks like Sarah Jessica Parker! Her friends giggle and respond with ""You're still too fat!"" The episode is also done in a Sex And The City style, in which the main character (Eddy) narrates the daily events of the other characters much like Carrie Bradshaw in the hit US sitcom.

""Small Opening"" is another one of my favourite episodes of this series. Saffy is producing a play about her life with her mother and Patsy, which she doesn't want her mum to know about. Eddy finds out by mistake through a phone call which she mistakes from her son Serge but is actually a scene from Saffy's play, so she calls the police. Patsy is frantic trying to hide all her drugs as the police arrive, with some hilarious scenes. Eddy is furious with her. Despite Edina's fury, the play goes ahead. Reluctantly, Eddy and Patsy turn up at the play and surprisingly find themselves enjoying it when they remember all the real-life quotes they said to Saffy years ago! The final episode, ""Menopause,"" is very good, but not the best one in this series. Womb prayers echo all around the house as Eddy and Patsy join Menopausals Anonymous! While Eddy detests this new group, Saffy has horrifying new visions of Patsy as a traditional housewife. These scenes are excellent and the episode finishes with what Eddy and Patsy will be like in decades time!

OVERALL GRADE: 10/10

Series 4 contains some great DVD extras, such as commentary by Jennifer Saunders and the Producer, Jon Plowman. Also included are 12 minutes of Out-Takes, Photo Gallery, Scene Selection, Behind The Scenes Interviews and the full pilot episode of Mirrorball, the Absolutely Fabulous spin-off which was transmitted on December 22nd 2000. All in all, Series 4 is essential for all you Ab Fab fantics out there, and with guest stars such as Ruby Wax, Marianne Faithfull, Anita Pallenberg, Dale Winton and many others, is another brilliant series from Jennifer Saunders!",1049241600,7,4311,4.811066126855601

Can Patsy handle being in front to the camera and act like a fabulous model again? Will Saffy make the cover as she flashes Paris? Will Eddie get lucky (with opposite sex that is) and is she any good? Would you like Patsys opinion on that, after all she watched that whole thing.

1664309,4,B00005U2KS,"After over 5 years after its last episode the Internationally acclaimed, award-winning British sitcom returned in late 2001 with its fourth season. Times had changed and quite clearly so had the programme. In an effort to keep with the ever-changing times and contemporary trends, Jennifer Saunders seems to have slightly adapted a more diverse approach to her writing. Though the fast, witty dialogue consistently flows, there are flaws in some of these episodes albeit only minors ones but don't capture the pace and magic of the origanal 3 seasons. Still there are more things to recommend it and fans of the series will surley be satisfied. Edina (Jennifer Saunders) and Joanna Lumley are as vile as ever, though Edina's self-obsessed dieting plan seems a little out of character and even as though ideas were wearing a little thin. But the cast carry this off with finesse regardless and both Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumleys timing is stil impeccable though the punchlines don't come quite as thick and fast as they once did. The first episode of the series, Paralox seems a little lost and not quite sure of which direction its trying to head but things pick up from here on with Fish farm where Edina hires a gardener who she thinks is a rich aristocrat and so sets about seducing him. There is a hark back to the good old days of the origanal series with some masterful comic playing by Saunders and Lumley whilst Paris is where Patsy gets involved in a magazine photoshoot and Edina and Saffy (Joanna Sawalha) begin actually bonding as mother and daughter (until the amusing climax). Donkey sees Edina frantically trying to take a detox and this is perharps one of the weaker episodes in this season whilst Small Opening sees saffy take her play about Edinas life onto the stage. The last episode is consistently amusing where Patsy and Eddy join Menopausals anonymous. The ending is another look into the future of Eddy and Patsy where they are hilariously seen as old women whihis distinctley reminiscent to the last episode of the third season in 1995. Still it remains amusing as does this series on the whole even though not eclipsing the first three seasons. Jane Horrocks turns up playing a pretentious daytime television presenter and June Whitfield as Edina's batty mother who is even more dizzier this time. Also included on this DVD is the television special, Mirror Ball starring the same cast and distinctley has the feel of an Absolutly Fabulous episode. A well comprised DVD with some interesting extra features included as the bonus. Highly recommended and a classic comic gem!",1036368000,6,2607,4.900452488687783

In addition to the new characters Katy Grin and Lady Candy are nice touches. The fact that Eddie had put down her Lacroix, who gives a cameo in the Paris episode, for a little more toned down style like Burrberry is a nice change.

1664315,5,B00005U2KS,"I waited 6 months from the time I first saw the new episodes (and watched them many times since) until now to write this review with some perspective. Ab Fab takes repeated viewings to fully comprehend what is going on all around, to the side of, and behind the main action. It was worth the wait.
To try and compare this series with the original 3 is like trying to compare yourself with who you were 5 years ago. Two different animals. Alike, yet compellingly different. So it is with Ab Fab.
Jennifer Saunders has wisely tweaked the characters with slight growing pains, small doses of mortality and post millenium lives. Everyone has moved forward, albiet at different speeds. Yet all the old excesses and mannerisms, like old friends, have followed. Deja vu with a hiccup.
I give this 5 stars because it is still the only thing on television that makes me laugh OUT LOUD. Except for French & Saunders, but she's in THAT also. Coincidence?
Vintage Jennifer Saunders genius.
Brief episode rating:
1.) SMALL OPENING ep. 5 - This was the one I was waiting for. The whole ""is it a bee?"" bit kills me. Hysterically funny, as good as ANYTHING done in the past! One laugh after another.
2.) MENOPAUSE ep. 6 - Another laugh riot for the collection. ""Stand on the bloody bin bags"". Again, as good as anything done in the past.
3.) FISH FARM ep. 2 - The more I watch this...the better it gets. The Marilyn Manson bit is a classic for the ages.
4.) PARIS ep. 3 - Mother and daughter bonding. Average, but with some good laughs.
5.) DONKEY ep. 4 - Another diet for Eddy and, Patsy showing forehead?! A bit predictable but more good laughs.
6.) PARRALOX ep. 1 - They can't all be the best. Too much, too fast. There are still some good laughs.
BONUS: All the extras are outstanding. Commentary by J.S. , the MIRRORBALL special, outtakes, guide to the guest stars, photos, etc.",1019433600,4,1867,4.5266272189349115
1664316,5,B00005U2KS,"The other reviewers have done a pretty good job in describing what you will get if you purchase ""Absolutely Fabulous"" Series 4.  So, all I've got to say is if you are a fan of this series, then you will not be disappointed with Series 4.  Some have complained that Series 4 is not as good as Series 3 or the other series.  However, you must keep in mind that there was a five year break between the 3th and 4th series, not to mention that I have always found that the first show(s) of any Abfab season are not as good as the ones that follow.  It seems as if the show warms up and starts cooking as it moves along.
And just when you think that there wasn't anymore that could be covered, Jennifer Saunders goes back and finds more.  I am really impressed with this DVD and can't wait for Series 5 (if there is one - does anyone know).  Of all the videos I have sold in my collection, I have not sold my Abfab 7 VHS tape set and I'm not selling this DVD.  Not only is this show hilarous, but it brings you back down to earth.  If there's a time when you find yourself obsessing over trends or fashion to excess and have highly unrealistic expectations about how you should look or you start valuing style over substance, pop an Abfab tape or DVD in and come back to earth.

Now, based on the original series and the ""Last Shout"" movie, I can see why so many people flipped for the whole she-bang.  I loved those original shows myself, and they are worth buying because they are funny--inspired, tuned-in to the zeitgeist, scabrous, etc etc etc . . . all things that series 4 is not.  I couldn't wait to see the new shows once they went to air.  Then they aired--I could feel myself desperate to laugh, but nothing.  Not one single laugh.  In fact, I felt embarrassed watching it all.  What on earth happened?  Series 4 is forced, utterly lacking in timing, mean without insight, and completely joyless.

Edina (Jennifer Saunders) and Patsy (Joanna Lumley) live in a world free of responsibility where shopping, drinking, affairs, high fashion and the 1960's sexual revolution are the highest virtues. Saffron (Julia Sawalha), Edina's daughter, lives in the real world of practicallity, education and accountability; and attempts to keep Edina & Patsy from going totally out of control, but usually fails.
The combination of these diametrically opposed personalities is totally hilarious and fun as you ponder just how far Edina & Patsy will go as well as seeing just how much more conservative Saffron will become.
I highly recommend the purchase of the this 2-DVD set of the fourth season.  If you don't have the first three seaons, I would highly recommend getting the 4-DVD set of the first three seasons also.",1017619200,3,910,5.066666666666666
1664319,5,B00005U2KS,"Now, let me just say first that I am a HUGE Ab Fab fan. When I first discovered ""Patsy"" and ""Eddie"" back in 1992 through a video clip by the ""Pet Shop Boys"" ironically enough, I have been enamored with those wonderfully wicked women who almost became like part of my family. I bought the DVD package of the first three seasons and still cherish them to this day.
 Well, when I wrote a review of this DVD for series 4, I goofed big time. And I am sorry for this but I was dead wrong on my first impression of this box set. Which is why I felt compelled to edit my review quite a long while after I posted it. About a year ago, I wrote a very harsh review about those new seasons of Ab Fab right here on amazon.com, giving it 2 stars. At that time, I wrote among other things that:

 -I was startled to find out just how unfunny and even irritating the new stuff was.
 -I wouldn't buy the DVD package of the new season even though I have the first three seasons in my collection.
 -I didn't plan on watching the new episodes more than once since I didn't feel they could stand the scrutiny of repeated viewings.
 Well, what do you know... A year later, I have to eat those words because, not only did I buy the DVD box set of season 4 after all, but I must also admit that I have watched every episode just as many times as the ones from the first three seasons. True, I have to state that some plot lines and situations feel a bit like rehash from earlier material but overall, my earlier criticism was way too hard. Which is why I decided to give this five stars this time around.
 Maybe it's because I had expected so much out of the new stuff because of my deep bond with those wacky characters that my ""pen"" was so vicious in that first review. Or maybe it was due to the fact that I simply wasn't in the right frame of mind when I first watched them which tainted my impression for a while afterwards. But I can admit it when I'm wrong and have to say I wasn't fair in my statement that the new material didn't live up to the original.
 It is true that some of the dialogue sounds a bit like what we heard in the original three seasons and some of the situations seem forced. But still, even though I wouldn't qualify them as ""perfect"", the episodes still contain enough laugh and can hold up very well on repeated viewings. I know because I have seen them all dozens of time since then.

 The strongest point in Ab Fab is without a doubt the acting. The three leads have made the roles their own and you can feel they really enjoy playing their parts. With each story told in ""satire"" mode and every line uttered in high camp, this series is like an ode to the art of being politically incorrect.
 Here, you get two aging women called Edina Monsoon and Patsy Stone, drugged and boozed out of their minds crawling through life, desperate for some fun and ""fabulousness"". And their antics is nicely balanced by Edina's daughter Saffron which acts like a responsible adult while dressing in drab clothes. This is all you need to know to enjoy this show and I am pretty sure you will, if you like camp comedies of course.
 About the DVD itself, it contains 6 episodes along with some nice special features: a nice outtakes segment (hilarious, even more funny than some of the lines from the episodes), the full ""Mirroball"" pilot which was a series Jennifer Saunders tried to get off the ground at BBC that wasn't picked up (and maybe it's just me but I found it quite boring honestly), along with a short interview with a very young Joanna Lumley (Patsy) from her modeling days.
 Therefore, I would tell you to buy this DVD package if you are a fan of the series but would recommend that you watch the first three seasons first if you've never seen them before since there is a sort of continuity to the show. It would make your experience with this new series more enjoyable if you had a sense of the history for those characters. Hope this was helpful!",1017446400,,3955,4.271390374331551

1664321,5,B00005U2KS,"I am a huge Jennifer Saunders fan and I thought that these episodes of AbFab are just as amazing as the first 3 seasons.  I think some might be daunted when watching these new episodes of AbFab because there are a few things that have changed in the series, but what did you expect?  The characters are still just as shallow as they have ever been.  Besides, a series can not stay the same forever or it would just be the same old thing all the time and become boring.  You can't compare the first 3 seasons of the show to the 4th because there has been a 5 year hiatus.  Ideas change, the world changes and television changes. I think by changing things a bit Jennifer Saunders has created more trouble and more laughs for the characters.  The jokes are just as dry, witty and humorous as the first episodes and I applaude her for that.
Plus, the dvd has an amazing selection of extra features like the commentary from Jennifer Saunders where she tells how she got inspiration for the jokes and episodes.  The out-takes are absolutely hilarious and filled with funny moments from the cast.  Also, one of the best features is the full length pilot episode of ""Mirrorball"" which was going to be Jennifer Saunders' new series on the BBC.  It has the entire cast of AbFab playing different characters, and it is fun to see their wide range of acting abilities.  Plus, the episode was actually quite funny. There is a lot of slapstick comedy in it.  So, all in all, I would absolutely recommend buying this dvd collection. It is a must have for any AbFab fan.",1015891200,3,1555,4.459363957597173
1664322,4,B00005U2KS,"If you're a fan of the original three seasons of ABFAB like me then this fourth season might feel like a bit of a let down.  It seems that all the characters have been changed in slight ways that somehow messes with the magic formula created originally.  Saffy seems a bit more aggressive, Edina more cruel, patsy more alive and Gran more ditzy than ever.  edina seems to have been beaten down and is ready to do things that she never wouls've dreamed of doing in the first series (dieting) and Patsy has lost that far off, dazed drugged out aspect and is now playing a dominatrix, trying to be a model and other such asprations.  It makes for some funny situations, but it's doesn't quite feel like ABFAB.  In no way are these shows bad, just not as fabulous as the originals.
The DVD itself has terrific production qualities.  The picture is widescreen and colors are bright and crisp.  The menus are easy to navigate and there is pleny of bonus mterial.  OF that bonus material, ""Mirror Ball"" is the best.  It's a pilot for a  series Jennifer Saunders was working on that features all the actors of ABFAB, but in different roles and in a different setting.  it's quite fun to see them doing different charactes for a change.  Too bad it never got picked up.  My only qualm with the DVD is that the text on the character bio screen (as well as a few others), is terribly hard to read.  This is a consistant problem with DVDs and why the makers of these things don't realise that we actually might want to read what they've put so much time and effort into is beyond me.
For die hards, this set can't be missed, but people who are new to the show should check out the original three seasons first.  Remember that sin is in darling.",1015632000,23,1732,4.385579937304075

I was wrong and I still don't understand why.
The DVD is wondrous to behold: hilarious out-takes, that gem of an interview with Patsy in her model days. I remember almost arriving at fisticuffs in Muriel's with the late great Jeff Bernard for slagging her off as a Booker Prize judge. Bright ladies, both, and a show that has lost none of its lustre.
