6554208,3,B00M2FJT12,"I was hoping ""Hangover 3"" would be a remake of 1 and 2 when Alan (Zach Galifianakis) avers ""I will never change."" For those who complained that ""Hangover 2"" was too much like the original...be careful what you ask for.

This film builds upon the events from the first film for plot and humor. Our threesome must capture Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong) or else Doug (Justin Bartha) will be killed by crime boss Marshall (John Goodman). Goodman revives his famous potty line from the ""Branded"" scene of ""The Big Lebowski"" which might go unnoticed among the 100 or so F-bombs dropped in the film.

The plot was boring compared to the other two features. This film relies on the delivery of over the top jokes from Zach Galifianakis which incorporates bizarre dark humor. Without this, the film is a bust. Good use of classic rock lyrics incorporated into the film.

No need to rush out and see this on the big screen.
