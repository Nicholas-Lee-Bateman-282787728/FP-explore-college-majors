8006879,5,B00015NN9Y,"I have loved taking yoga classes in the past; I like doing yoga frequently but now can't afford to go to class. This tape gives the simple and direct guidance and clear instruction in order to practice and really do the work. She does all but come out of the ""tube"" to make corrections. It has turned my search for a home practice into a time and event I look forward to each day. What a break to have found this video!",1134259200,,419,4.121951219512195
8006880,5,B00015NN9Y,"I have watched a lot of yoga videos, always hoping (usually without success) to find one that is easy to follow, well produced and designed for use by an average person (including men!).  I just bought Yoga Anytime Anyplace after a friend recommended it and I'm happy to say that it is the first yoga video that fits the bill perfectly.  It is hands down the best yoga video on the market.  The video is beautiful to watch, easy to follow and above all inspiring.  As opposed to some yoga videos that are are overly gimmicky or over-produced, Yoga Anytime Anyplace provides direct and technically superb instruction. By the way, take a look at Yoga 3's website (yoga-anytimeanyplace.com) -- it has lots of great information.",1086652800,,724,4.768
8006881,5,B00015NN9Y,"Yoga Anytime Anyplace is beautifully done!  It is unusual to find an exercise video that is as attentive to artistic detail as this one. Not only is it a complete routine that is revitalizing and refreshing to do but the use of rich colors and wonderful music interwoven throughout makes it fun to watch again and again. Ameeta Nanji is easy to follow; as her clear voice helps to still and focus the mind, she encourages the body to stretch a little bit further. As a Shiatsu practitioner I find this to be a good complement to my daily exercise program.",1078012800,,555,4.4950495049504955
8006882,5,B00015NN9Y,"I've tried several other tapes, however they never sustained my interest visually. This tape is just beautiful with excellent instruction and the most fabulous music I've ever heard on a Yoga tape. I look forward to practicing with Ameeta at least 3 times a week, and haven't tired of her soothing voice yet.",1076025600,,308,4.830188679245283
8006883,4,B00015NN9Y,"This video has simple instructions and poses for any beginner.  I found the Yoga video every helpful for people unfamilar with the Yoga practice.  It discusses how Yoga works the body and the mind without being flowerly.  The poses are so basic and comfortable, that any beginner can use this video to gain strength without feeling like a pretzel.",1075766400,,347,4.8474576271186445
8006884,5,B00015NN9Y,I started this yoga program last month  and enjoy following Ameeta Nanji's close attention to detail and find it encouraging and relaxing at the same time.  I have been using this tape two times a week and find that I can move my body more easily. I am a beginner yoga exerciser and definately recommend this tape. I plan on continuing and look forward to strengthening my body. The tape is visually beautiful and Ameeta is very encouraging.,1073779200,,441,4.641025641025641
8006885,5,B00015NN9Y,"I never thought I'd like yoga, and never thought I could do it, until I did this tape with Ameeta Nanji. Her demonstrations are easily followed and there was nothing intimidating at all. After just a few weeks of practicing Yoga Anytime Anyplace 3 times weekly, I already feel better. My aching back is more flexible and my hips are loosening up. Try this tape!!!",1073606400,,363,4.6
