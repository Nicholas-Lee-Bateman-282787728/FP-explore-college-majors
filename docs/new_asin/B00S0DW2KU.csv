6938193,5,B00S0DW2KU,"In 1980,Sherman Hemsley and the late Isabel Sanford were ""movin' on up"" for the seventh season of The Jeffersons. An actors' strike delayed the start of the 1980-81 season for at least most series. Here's what happens this season: George's(Hemsley) and Louise's(Sanford) granddaughter Jessica Jefferson celebrates her first birthday. Well,maybe there is no celebration but I know she was born the preceding season. The Jeffersons' son Lionel(the late Mike Evans) and his wife the former Jenny Willis(Berlinda Tolbert) still frequently visit Lionel's parents frequently,with Lionel's and Jenny's daughter Jessica in tow,of course. Louise,Jenny and Jenny's mother Helen(the late Roxie Roker) patronize a male strip club and surprisingly discover Helen's white husband ""Terrific Tom""(the late Franklin Cover) and ""Gorgeous George"" dancing. The Jeffersons' live-in housekeeper Florence Johnston(Marla Gibbs) babysits Jessica. Florence entertains Jessica by staging a pretense fight(with puppets) between ""Sweet Florence"" and ""Mean George"". There's the four-part episode where Florence and the Jeffersons vacation in Hawaii at the same time that Tom and Helen are. The most touching situation of all is where Florence quits servicing the Jeffersons only to return a short time later. A fight between Florence and the Jeffersons led to this. Florence sought employment at a hotel thus Gibbs being given her short-lived spinoff CHECKING IN,premiering in early 1981. After a fire destroys the hotel,Florence continues servicing the Jeffersons and Gibbs returns to the parent series. In Florence's absence both George and Louise each interview their new potential housekeepers. They're both hired but neither accepts,so exit them and re-enter Florence! Despite a few differences,George and Florence love each other(not romantically,of course). The recently departed Paul Benedict as the Jeffersons' English next-door neighbor Harry Bentley leaves the series for the next two seasons. There were only 20 half-hour episodes this season,marking the second shortest season of all 11(season 1 was the first).",1228953600,20,2094,5.868852459016393

6938235,5,B00S0DW2KU,"Season 6 of this classic TV show was released on DVD back in 2007. It's 2012 and still no word on season 7! What's up with that? I do know one fact about a company called ""Shout! Factory"". Now they seem to pick up alot of these cancelled tv shows that Sony Pictures began releasing in the first place. Take ""All in the Family"" for example. ""The Jeffersons"" and ""All in the Family"" was sort of being released in the same time frame. Both shows made it to season six then stopped for the longest time. Next thing I know I read that ""All in the Family"" was getting picked up by another company. ""Season 7 is on it's way from Shout! Factory for All in the Family"" it said. This company is picking up the rights to most (some) of these cancelled tv show DVD's. Since they finished ""All in the Family"" hopefully ""Shout! Factory"" will concider picking up ""The Jeffersone"". Let's hope so.",1350518400,3,880,4.33939393939394
6938236,5,B00S0DW2KU,"Confused as to WHY this and additional seasons are being withheld.  Considering most ""material"" that's offered on DVD, it's confounding why this classic series is being kept from the public that holds it so dear.

6938238,5,B00S0DW2KU,As a fan of The Jeffersons for years I am hoping SHout! factory will pick up the remaining seasons of this show. Season 6 of this and All in the family came out what seams like years ago and Shout! did pick up All in the Family. Shout! Factory are you listening: PLEASE DO THE SAME FOR THE JEFFERSONS. I will forever be greatful!,1282089600,4,329,4.15625

6938240,5,B00S0DW2KU,"I just can't understand what sony is doing yet they have all of these new sitcoms released very fast and the shows haven't even finished airing yet. There's just no reason at all no poor dvd sales or nothing, and that goes along with ALL IN THE FAMILY also with their delayed release. Come on sony already we're waiting.",1266537600,4,320,4.440677966101695
6938241,4,B00S0DW2KU,"This i really starting to get old, or more accurately, we are, while we continue to wait for the video labels to complete these Television Collections.

I am currently waiting on a number unfinished TV series to be released on DVD from various labels. Some have been delayed by years... For example, Knots Landing comprises of 14 seasons, yet Warner Bros. insists on dragging out the release dates. Only the first two seasons have been released so far, with the Season One originally released in March of 2006 - that's 4 years ago!!! At this rate, we can expect this series to be completed in 28 years, if at all!!!  The same issue holds true for The Jeffersons, as well as a number of other notable shows like 'The Lucy Show'. Releasing one season every 2-3 years is ridiculous, and just plain bad business. I, for one, refuse to start collecting any additional TV series on DVD until I see evidence that the label has released the entire series in a timely manner. If the studios don't want my money, that's fine with me.

Here's hoping that Sony will finish the job they started...

(The rating above is based on the original content of 'The Jeffersons: The Complete Seventh Season', providing we ever get to see it again.)",1266105600,6,1226,4.610091743119266
6938242,5,B00S0DW2KU,"I collect a lot of Dvd collection for shows back in the 70's. The Jeffersons happens to be one of  the collections. I am very upset about seeing that sony is releasing all in the family season 7, but what about the Jeffersons season 7. I among others have been waiting for this Dvd collection to come out about 3 years now. Why is sony dragging tail about releasing this dvd. I hope that they bring out the Jeffersons season 7 around the same time.",1244592000,2,448,4.270588235294118
