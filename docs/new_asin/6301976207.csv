417244,4,6301976207,"I have seen almost all of Joan Crawford's films, and I think this is one of her finest performances. She is fortunately paired with Clark Gable, and they have remarkable chemistry together. It is their combined talent and star presence that make Strange Cargo such a good film. Joan plays the typical tough girl, but makes her character a lot deeper than lesser actresses could. She goes through most of the film wearing no makeup (very unusual for Crawford), and loses the artificial restraint that plagues so many of her performances. She approaches the role without holding anything back (much like in Humoresque and Rain), and she shines.  It's a refreshing performance for any Crawford fan to watch, because we enjoy these rare glimpses of the excellent actress and beautiful person that were beneath her glamorous facade.  May I also add that without makeup, Joan Crawford is still tremendously beautiful and captivating. She has excellent bone structure and large, wistful eyes. This film proves that it wasn't the makeup and artificial glamour that made Crawford beautiful (as some authors would have you believe), but something from within. That's what this movie is about.",1024704000,9,1182,5.119170984455959

417246,5,6301976207,"Strange is putting it mildly.  In this uniquely off-beat gem, Crawford is Julie the trollop and Gable is Verne, who's sentenced to Devil's Island.  A fascinating excursion into allegory has Ian Hunter giving his greatest performance as Cambreau, the PRESENCE, in human guise: The Catholic Legion of Decency had a fit when this character was shown; in light of what's allowed in films today, this is hilarious!  Because of Hunter's Christ-like consciousness, the condemned men are intolerant of his presence.  When he is seen by Gable to be near death by drowning, Gable realises that he cannot let this mysterious but undeniably decent man die, so he rescues him from the inevitable.  Both Joan and Clark play well together in their final teaming and, because of it's offbeat theme, the movie tends to linger in the memory; many consider this to be the best of all their movies in which they appeared together.",947721600,7,910,4.921568627450981

417285,4,6301976207,"I saw this movie on TCM many years ago starring Joan Crawford and Clark Gable. Crawford plays Julie, a loose woman, who stumbles upon Gable, a brute, in a penal colony. His rough handling of Crawford thruout the film was abhorrent. They should have made his character more gentle, then he would have been charming instead of despicable. The acting in the film was fine, including Ian Hunter and Peter Lorre. Hunter was the ""Anointed One"" so to speak, who appeared out of nowhere- the Bible toting ""Savior"" who brings Salvation to the men in their direst moments. Toward the end, Crawford and Gable were also affected. This is one of Crawford's and Gable's better films. Above average. I like it.",1476662400,3,695,4.75206611570248

I did love this movie, it is about my favorite movie theme:  redemption.  It successfully tackles the Biblical idea of how faith in God can change people and it clearly and dramatically presents the Christian gospel.  Ian Hunter is the perfect foil for Gable's bitter, hard hitting, fast talking rascal. Joan Crawford plays a compelling lost soul: cynical and world weary. The dialog is fast and clever and Crawford has some great lines:  ""Don't tap your heart, you'll break your fingers.""

417329,4,6301976207,"""Strange Cargo"" is the 8th and final pairing of Joan Crawford (who got top billing) and Clark Gable.

Gable was MGM's biggest male star and he was paired with several of their leading ladies. The most famous pairing was with his great friend (whom he called ""Sis"") Jean Harlow (6 films, the last 5 all top 10 box office winners), but he was paired 7 times with Myrna Loy and 8 times with Crawford.

Clark Gable (1901-60) was one of the biggest stars of the 20th century, and a pretty good actor to boot. He's best remembered as Rhett Butler for ""GWTW"" (1939), for which he received one of his three Oscar nominations:  the others were for ""It Happened One Night"" (1934) and ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1935). My favorite Gable flick is ""Run Silent Run Deep"" (1958). Gable plays a hardened thief imprisoned in a French penal colony.

Joan Crawford(1905-77) plays a brassy prostitute working in the town alongside the prison. At the time of this film, Crawford was MGM's biggest female star. Her marriage to Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (1929) and then Franchot Tone (1935) and her success with films like ""Possessed"" (1931), ""Grand Hotel"" (1932), ""Dancing Lady"" (1933), and ""The Women"" put her at the top. Despite her achievements to date, her best years were ahead, with two Oscar nominations (""Possessed"" in 1948 and ""Sudden Fear"" in 1953) and one win (""Mildred Pierce"") in 1946. Crawford is wonderful in this role, which seems to have been written for Jean Harlow.

Albert Dekker (1905-68) co-stars as the mastermind of the prison break and a tough guy to boot. Dekker appeared in more than 50 films and is best remembered for his villainous roles - Big Jim Colfax in ""The Killers"" (1946), the evil Dr. Thorkel in ""Dr. Cyclops"" (1940), the evil Dr. Soberin in ""Kiss Me Deadly"" (1955) and the evil railroad man Pat Harrigan in ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969). Dekker puts in his usual good performance and shows that he's a physical match for Gable, but his cockney accent sometimes fails him.

Ian Hunter (1900-75) plays a member of the breakout crew who has an uncanny ability to predict the fate of others. Hunter is probably best remembered for his role as King Richard in ""Adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938) and his recurring role on the TV series of the same name.

Paul Lucas (1891-1971) plays a serial killer and the one prisoner who is able to resist Hunter's charisma. Lucas won the Oscar and the Golden Globe for his performance in ""Watch Over the Rhine"" (1943), a considerable feat considering  he was up against Bogart (""Casablanca"") and Gary Cooper (""For Whom the Bell Tolls""). He's probably best known as the Professor from Disney's ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"".

Eduardo Ciannelli (1889-1969) has a small role as an inmate. We know him best from his performance as one of the most evil characters in film history, the head of the Thuggee cult in ""Gunga Din"" (1939). In 1961 he won the Tony for ""The Devil's Advocate"" (1961).

The great Peter Lorre (1904-64) has a small role as Mousier Pig, a character interested in Crawford. Lorre was unique. He gave unforgettable performances in films like ""M"" (1931), ""Casablanca"" (1942), and ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941) among the nearly 100 films he made. Paul Lucas and Lorre were good friends and fellow Hungarians, but they shared no scenes in the film.

Frank Borzage (1893-1962) started as an actor in silent films and then became a director. He was heavily influenced by German director F.W. Murnau with whom he worked. He won the Oscar for ""7th Heaven"" (1927) and ""Bad Girl"" (1931) and specialized in films in which love must conquer adversity. This was Borzage's first film with a religious motif, and his later films would reflect this influence.

Franz Waxman (1906-67) provides the score. Waxman was nominated for an Oscar 10 times and won twice (""A Place in the Sun"" and ""Sunset Blvd""). He was a favorite of Hitchcock who used him in 4 films and earned 2 of his Oscar nominations (""Rebecca"" and ""Suspicion""). Sometimes Waxman's scores can overwhelm a film, but in this case he is in perfect harmony with the script.

Robert Planck (1902-71) is the cinematographer. He lensed more than 100 films and was nominated for an Oscar 4 times - ""Anchors Aweigh"" (1945), ""The Three Musketeers"" (1948), ""Little Women"" (1949), and ""Lili"" (1953). His work filming the voyage in a small boat is excellent.

The film is basically a love story set against a prison break, but superimposed on this theme is a religious story about redemption and belief in oneself and in God. At various points, each of the characters gets to assess his/her life and to decide how they will spend the rest of their time on Earth, regardless of how long or short.  The love story is pretty standard stuff, performed well by Crawford and Gable with Lorre as the antagonist. The prison drama is also pretty standard stuff. What sets this film apart is the religious subtheme, and while it isn't well crafted, it is certainly interesting.",1301270400,4,4949,4.771929824561403
417330,5,6301976207,"""Don't tap your heart. You'll break your finger."" -- Crawford to Gable

Director Frank Borzage, the greatest romanticist ever to work in Hollywood, had made films of enduring beauty and sentimentality in both the silent and sound era. His ability to handle sensitive subject matter was never put to the test in the way it was when he signed on to film Richard Sale's ""None Too Narrow...None Too Deep"" for MGM, however. He would have to balance the fire between stars Clark Gable and Joan Crawford with a story having delicate spiritual overtones. The end results are a unique cinematic masterpiece in which Borzage shows his audience it is never too late.

Lawrence Hazard's sharp and sometimes racy dialog sounds as if Howard Hawks had been standing over his shoulder, telling him just how to write Crawford's character. She is very much the embodiment of how his world weary and leery men view women. But Borzage will allow the delicate spiritual message to reveal what is underneath, and in the heart. It is as if Borzage is filming two stories at once, from different eras, and in very different genres. Yet he somehow makes it work; both as entertainment and something more substantive. Gable's charisma is on full display here and Crawford has one of her finest moments onscreen in a scene opposite Ian Hunter that plays like an apology for Rain.

Gable's Verne is a thief being released after sixteen months in solitary confinement for his fifth escape attempt in three years. He seems incorrigible, and destined not to make it out of the penal colony alive. But Grideau (Frederic Worcock), the head of the island's prison, sees something worth redeeming in Verne. Allowed to work outside the prison walls down on the wharf, he runs into Julie (Joan Crawford) and they begin the first of many salty exchanges which caused the film to be condemned by the Legion of Decency. It also is what kept viewers entertained as a much deeper and more spiritual story begins to unfold. It would be this aspect of the film which would tip the scales against it in the eyes of the Legion of Decency, which today seems ridiculous.

When Verne sneaks out to get a load of Julie dressed up, (""Grief ain't what I came after, Baby"") and she promptly turns him in, sparks are flying everywhere. But in the meantime, a mysterious prisoner who carries a small bible that no one remembers having ever seen before, shows up to replace Verne for the returning head count. Fans of Borzage know in that exact moment there's much more going on here than a racy late 1930's romance. What follows is a unique blend of entertainment laced with a spiritual message which finally collide, leaving the viewer mesmerized by what they've just seen.

There is plenty of action and conflict, with a jungle and an ocean between Verne and freedom. Paul Lukas, Albert Dekker, Howard Bromberg, and Eduardo Cianelli are a few of his fellow escapees. But it is Ian Hunter's Cambreau who seems to always know what's going to happen, and how to get there. While Gable and Crawford spar, he helps those who might not make it find peace before their light dims, and seems to know what's in their hearts. Crawford is marvelous as she struggles against believing but knows it must be so when Cambreau is the only one who knows she's been saying silent prayers for them all. Verne may be the toughest nut to crack, however, as only in a storm on a boat does he realize he may have just thrown his salvation, and future, overboard.

Peter Lorre plays to perfection the lovelorn stool pigeon, M'sieu Pig, who Crawford's Julie finds so replulsive she comments hurtfully that he's the one man in the world she could never get low enough to touch. Franz Waxman's score complements nicely the photography of Robert Plack and art direction of MGM's Cedric Gibbons to create an atmospheric film pleasing on all fronts. Gable and Crawford were always good together and are fantastic here, their back and forth containing a rare edge. It is the spiritual tone and message, however, which make for a one-of-a-kind movie experience. Another truly great film by a true master of both nitrate and celluloid, Frank Borzage.",1245542400,12,4164,4.760387811634349
417331,5,6301976207,"In this movie there was both a rare sense of innocence and sensuality that made Joan's part even more multi-faceted! Joan plays Joan in this 1940 MGM classic, staring with her number one leading man, Clark Gable. Much of this masterpiece is shot on a boat and outside and Joan looks all the more stunning and natural! I've added a couple pictures&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/here/dp/6301976207/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">here </a>&nbsp;for you! BTW, ""Strange Cargo"" will be shown on TCM on Fri., 1-11-08  @ 9:00 a.m.!

Why was Miss Crawford such a fascinating and unconventional star...?

Miss Crawford was a first-rate star, who worked her a-s-s off to get to where she was! And, do you know what she did once she got there? She worked 10 times harder...! Joan had the longest and most impressive film career of any star during Tinseltown's famed Golden Age of Cinema! Joan's career lasted 5 decades! And her career proved to be more loyal to her than any lover or husband! Miss Crawford was always known for her fashion-sense, classical beauty and the ability to constantly re-invent herself (half a century before the Material Girl was a household name!)

Joan Crawford started her career in 1925 as a flapper, playing in bit parts as a contract-player for the most glorious studio in town, MGM. She was nothing more than a glorified prop, unbilled in her first film, ""Lady of the Night."" Soon, Joan was promoted to leading-lady, appearing in such critically-acclaimed pictures as, Harry Langdon's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tramp-Tramp-Tramp/dp/B00004Z4W3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tramp, Tramp, Tramp</a>, and Lon Chaney's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Unknown/dp/B0000B1O9L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Unknown</a>. But it wasn't until Joan accepted the role of Diana Medford, in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Our-Dancing-Daughters/dp/6302048982/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Our Dancing Daughters</a>&nbsp;that she became a bona fide star! By the end of the decade Joan had more than 20 pictures under her belt!

In the 30's when many silent stars were bowing out gracefully, Joan was back with a vengeance! This time Joan was the little shop girl that Depression-Era American ladies (and maybe even some boys, too) could really identify with. Miss Crawford could be seen acting in such famed movies as, ""Letty Lynton,""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rain/dp/B00011D1MC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rain</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sadie-Mckee/dp/6301978242/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sadie Mckee</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grand-Hotel/dp/B0009S4IKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grand Hotel </a>, and one of my personal favorites,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forsaking-All-Others/dp/630241346X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forsaking All Others </a>. Some of the 25 classics that Joan also made during the 30's include:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dancing-Lady/dp/B000F7CMPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dancing Lady</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Laughing-Sinners/dp/630278705X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Laughing Sinners</a>, Dance, Fools, Dance, Chained, ""No More Ladies,"" The Gorgeous Hussy, Love on the Run (1936), The Bride Wore Red, Mannequin (1938) and of course one of her most popular ever, The Women !

""No more goddamn shop girls,"" Joan was once quoted as saying to MGM chief-honcho, Louis B. Mayer. In the 40's Joan yet again came back in another one of her many incarnations, this time as the society matron in such movies as, When Ladies Meet (1941), Reunion in France and Susan & God. In 1942 Miss Crawford donated her entire salary from Columbia's They All Kissed the Bride to charity and then she turned around and fired her agent when he didn't do the same! After 18 years of being a member of the MGM family, Miss Crawford took a huge gamble and decided to branch out, this time working for the actor's studio, Warners. Joan's first film for Warners, was her most famous movie, and it garnered her the Oscar for Best Actress; playing the title role in her defining-film, Mildred Pierce . Joan also made a slew other first-rate pictures during this period, such as: Humoresque, ""Daisy Kenyon,"" and Flamingo Road (1949). Moving to Warners really paid off for Miss Crawford, because she also received her second Academy Award nomination for Possessed, playing the harried Louise Howell! Of course, Miss Crawford had all the time in the world to donate to the war-effort. Joan was often seen at the Hollywood Canteen entertaining our boys; ...how many of today's movie stars get off their pedestals to do this?

The 50's marked a very pivotal time in Joan's illustrious career. Because in the next chapter of her picture resume, she played the determined and strong matriarch in many wonderful dramatic cinematic masterpieces. Such as, Harriet Craig, Queen Bee, ""Female on the Beach,"" The Damned Don't Cry, ""Goodbye My Fancy,"" The Story of Esther Costello and Autumn Leaves. Miss Crawford also received her third Academy Award nomination playing Myra Hudson in RKO's Sudden Fear. And never one to be typecast, Joan made a big splash in Johnny Guitar, playing a tough saloon owner in the wild-west! Also beginning in the 50's, Joan took up the campaign as official spokeswoman for Pepsi-Cola; a coveted role that she enjoyed for more than 18 years!

In the 60's Miss Crawford didn't slow down for a second! Nope! She came out swinging. Joan made the whole country ask in droves, What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? . In one of her most well-known pictures ever, Joan played Blanche Hudson, opposite another very talented actress, Ms. Bette Davis, in this gorgeous Warners film! Throughout all the 60's Miss Crawford was known as the ""Scream Queen."" She stared in such cult-favorites as, Strait-Jacket, Della, I Saw What You Did and Berserk! It was also around this time, that Miss Crawford penned her autobiography, A Portrait of Joan Crawford.

Even in semi-retirement, Miss Crawford still always kept busy during the 1970's. This time she was the Hollywood Legend, and everyone knew it! When the movie studios weren't knocking on her door, she switched to television. In one of her last television appearances, Miss Crawford played the part of Joan Fairchild in ABC's ""The Sixth Sense: Dear Joan: We're Going to Scare You to Death."" She also wrote her second book, the best-selling My Way of Life. And, Joan always found the time for some of her favorite charities; donating her talent and time to The Muscular Dystrophy Association and The American Cancer Society. Of course, Joan also made time to speak to her good friend and journalist Roy Newquist. Mr. Newquist was actually the only writer that Miss Crawford chose to speak to during the late 70's, and his thoughtful (and unprecedented) interviews with Joan were published in the 1980 book, Conversations with Joan Crawford.

Miss Crawford perished a second time when the majority of the public threw her away and vilified her as a lunatic. But this death was much more painful. Because not only were Joan's films forgotten, but all of the good she did during her lifetime was also completely erased! Could a violent and crazed-alcoholic have accomplished just half of what Miss Crawford did in her life? And, could they have pulled it off with such perfection, like Joan always did? As far as I'm concerned, it's preposterous to think that Miss Crawford would have ever done anything to put her good name or her livelihood on the line. The true Joan Crawford was kind, compassionate and generous to a fault. Joan was a self-made lady who worked for everything she got. She just wanted to keep her head above water in a man's world where women didn't have a voice or a choice. Miss Crawford never for a second forgot where she came from or who she was, and she never for a moment let her beloved fans down! All Joan wanted was for someone to give her a chance and believe in her.

If you're interested in learning about the true Joan Crawford, I recommend watching some of her pictures. Joan has always said that her true biography is on film. As you may know, Joan has a very detailed movie library that may look intimidating at first, since it is so long and impressive. A good place to start is her boxed set , which includes some of her greatest movies. Miss Crawford also has a second set  that will be out next year, too. And, I recommend reading Conversations With Joan Crawford, because this book showed the true Joan Crawford. I also recommend these books, as well: A portrait of Joan;: The autobiography of Joan Crawford , Joan Crawford: Her Life in Letters and Joan Crawford, a biography. And there will be a new book about Joan out by Feb. '08, Not the Girl Next Door: Joan Crawford, a Personal Biography; which is supposed be the most accurate and comprehensive biography ever penned!

Shortly before her death, when asked if she would do it all over again, Miss Crawford bluntly said, ""It's difficult to answer that question because part of me believes in Predestination - you know, someone up there is pulling the strings, what ever will be will be."" In the end, after all has been said about her, Joan was just a person looking for some happiness; she just wanted to make it through the night, no different from the rest of us.",1196553600,11,9675,5.564538043478261
417332,4,6301976207,"I was watching this movie last night primarily because I like Gable as an actor.  The movie started out in much the same way most movies did back then; setting the stage for the eventual mild action and not-so-mild romance.  I was watching but doing other things at the same time until I realized that the dialogue was gradually elevating itself to a level well above ""just another Clark Gable movie"".  I found myself focussing on the interaction between the characters; reluctant comrade prisoners escaping from Devil's Island.  The characters were diverse with little focus on their criminal background (except for Paul Lukas's Bluebeard-like past).  Some had strong allegiances with others while others were just in it for themselves.  The discussions that they had were as though written by one of the better playwrights of that era although I had never heard of the writer, Richard Sale, before.  There were moral issues and material issues discussed and there were some noble sacrifices involved.  Eventually, the escapees returned from their own little world to the ""real"" world and, not coincidently, the dialogue returned from the exceptional to the banal.  The ending was standard Hollywood fare.  However, I will gladly see this movie again for the bulk of the movie between opening and closing that puts ""Strange Cargo"" in a higher class of film.

The acting was very good with top honors going to Gable, Joan Crawford and especially Ian Hunter whose role was the one that grabbed my attention the most.  Oddly, one of my favorite character actors, Peter Lorre, was generally unimpressive in his role.  Gable's role called for his character to be shrewd, sinister, and selfish.  He comes across very well although, being Gable after all, he succumbs to the allure of Joan Crawford in the romantic ending.  I'm sure that ample credit for this movie's success lies with Frank Borzage.  The film had the look of a perfectionist who made sure that the lines were delivered with meaning and character rather than just good enough to get by with.  This is definitely one of Gable's top ten films; maybe even the top five.",1163203200,2,2127,4.946478873239436
417333,4,6301976207,"A religious parable aboard a small boat containing penal colony escapees. Ian Hunter is the Christ-like Cambreau who has a mysterious effect on everyone; Joan Crawford is Julie, the fallen woman; Clark Gable is Andre, the tough guy who falls in love with her; Paul Lukas is Hessler, the Devil figure; and Peter Lorre is Cochon, the scuzzball who also desires Crawford (he's also referred to as M'sieu Pig, an apt name). Hunter tries to keep everyone on the straight and narrow, and when Hunter defends Crawford for bringing Lorre aboard ship (her motives are good), Gable knocks him overboard. But his mysterious pull works like magic on Gabe, and he dives in and saves him. Crawford and Gable become lovers and return to the colony. The opening scenes are powerful, thanks to the tight script, and Gable and Crawford just about set the screen on fire. Banned at first in parts of the country because of some of their antics (later tamed down), the movie offer up a lot of excitement and a fine cast.",1149897600,4,1000,4.6875

BTW, ""Strange Cargo"" will be shown on TCM on Fri., 1-11-08  @ 9:00 a.m.!

Why was Miss Crawford such a fascinating and unconventional star...?

Miss Crawford was a first-rate star, who worked her a-s-s off to get to where she was! And, do you know what she did once she got there? She worked 10 times harder...! Joan had the longest and most impressive film career of any star during Tinseltown's famed Golden Age of Cinema! Joan's career lasted 5 decades! And her career proved to be more loyal to her than any lover or husband! Miss Crawford was always known for her fashion-sense, classical beauty and the ability to constantly re-invent herself (half a century before the Material Girl was a household name!)

Joan Crawford started her career in 1925 as a flapper, playing in bit parts as a contract-player for the most glorious studio in town, MGM. She was nothing more than a glorified prop, unbilled in her first film, ""Lady of the Night."" Soon, Joan was promoted to leading-lady, appearing in such critically-acclaimed pictures as, Harry Langdon's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tramp-Tramp-Tramp/dp/B00004Z4W3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tramp, Tramp, Tramp</a>, and Lon Chaney's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Unknown/dp/B0000B1O9L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Unknown</a>. But it wasn't until Joan accepted the role of Diana Medford, in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Our-Dancing-Daughters/dp/6302048982/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Our Dancing Daughters</a>&nbsp;that she became a bona fide star! By the end of the decade Joan had more than 20 pictures under her belt!

In the 30's when many silent stars were bowing out gracefully, Joan was back with a vengeance! This time Joan was the little shop girl that Depression-Era American ladies (and maybe even some boys, too) could really identify with. Miss Crawford could be seen acting in such famed movies as, ""Letty Lynton,""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rain/dp/B00011D1MC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rain</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sadie-Mckee/dp/6301978242/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sadie Mckee</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grand-Hotel/dp/B0009S4IKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grand Hotel </a>, and one of my personal favorites,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forsaking-All-Others/dp/630241346X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forsaking All Others </a>. Some of the 25 classics that Joan also made during the 30's include:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dancing-Lady/dp/B000F7CMPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dancing Lady</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Laughing-Sinners/dp/630278705X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Laughing Sinners</a>, Dance, Fools, Dance, Chained, ""No More Ladies,"" The Gorgeous Hussy, Love on the Run (1936), The Bride Wore Red, Mannequin (1938) and of course one of her most popular ever, The Women !

""No more goddamn shop girls,"" Joan was once quoted as saying to MGM chief-honcho, Louis B. Mayer. In the 40's Joan yet again came back in another one of her many incarnations, this time as the society matron in such movies as, When Ladies Meet (1941), Reunion in France and Susan & God. In 1942 Miss Crawford donated her entire salary from Columbia's They All Kissed the Bride to charity and then she turned around and fired her agent when he didn't do the same! After 18 years of being a member of the MGM family, Miss Crawford took a huge gamble and decided to branch out, this time working for the actor's studio, Warners. Joan's first film for Warners, was her most famous movie, and it garnered her the Oscar for Best Actress; playing the title role in her defining-film, Mildred Pierce . Joan also made a slew other first-rate pictures during this period, such as: Humoresque, ""Daisy Kenyon,"" and Flamingo Road (1949). Moving to Warners really paid off for Miss Crawford, because she also received her second Academy Award nomination for Possessed, playing the harried Louise Howell! Of course, Miss Crawford had all the time in the world to donate to the war-effort. Joan was often seen at the Hollywood Canteen entertaining our boys; ...how many of today's movie stars get off their pedestals to do this?

The 50's marked a very pivotal time in Joan's illustrious career. Because in the next chapter of her picture resume, she played the determined and strong matriarch in many wonderful dramatic cinematic masterpieces. Such as, Harriet Craig, Queen Bee, ""Female on the Beach,"" The Damned Don't Cry, ""Goodbye My Fancy,"" The Story of Esther Costello and Autumn Leaves. Miss Crawford also received her third Academy Award nomination playing Myra Hudson in RKO's Sudden Fear. And never one to be typecast, Joan made a big splash in Johnny Guitar, playing a tough saloon owner in the wild-west! Also beginning in the 50's, Joan took up the campaign as official spokeswoman for Pepsi-Cola; a coveted role that she enjoyed for more than 18 years!

In the 60's Miss Crawford didn't slow down for a second! Nope! She came out swinging. Joan made the whole country ask in droves, What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? . In one of her most well-known pictures ever, Joan played Blanche Hudson, opposite another very talented actress, Ms. Bette Davis, in this gorgeous Warners film! Throughout all the 60's Miss Crawford was known as the ""Scream Queen."" She stared in such cult-favorites as, Strait-Jacket, Della, I Saw What You Did and Berserk! It was also around this time, that Miss Crawford penned her autobiography, A Portrait of Joan Crawford.

Even in semi-retirement, Miss Crawford still always kept busy during the 1970's. This time she was the Hollywood Legend, and everyone knew it! When the movie studios weren't knocking on her door, she switched to television. In one of her last television appearances, Miss Crawford played the part of Joan Fairchild in ABC's ""The Sixth Sense: Dear Joan: We're Going to Scare You to Death."" She also wrote her second book, the best-selling My Way of Life. And, Joan always found the time for some of her favorite charities; donating her talent and time to The Muscular Dystrophy Association and The American Cancer Society. Of course, Joan also made time to speak to her good friend and journalist Roy Newquist. Mr. Newquist was actually the only writer that Miss Crawford chose to speak to during the late 70's, and his thoughtful (and unprecedented) interviews with Joan were published in the 1980 book, Conversations with Joan Crawford.

Miss Crawford perished a second time when the majority of the public threw her away and vilified her as a lunatic. But this death was much more painful. Because not only were Joan's films forgotten, but all of the good she did during her lifetime was also completely erased! Could a violent and crazed-alcoholic have accomplished just half of what Miss Crawford did in her life? And, could they have pulled it off with such perfection, like Joan always did? As far as I'm concerned, it's preposterous to think that Miss Crawford would have ever done anything to put her good name or her livelihood on the line. The true Joan Crawford was kind, compassionate and generous to a fault. Joan was a self-made lady who worked for everything she got. She just wanted to keep her head above water in a man's world where women didn't have a voice or a choice. Miss Crawford never for a second forgot where she came from or who she was, and she never for a moment let her beloved fans down! All Joan wanted was for someone to give her a chance and believe in her.

If you're interested in learning about the true Joan Crawford, I recommend watching some of her pictures. Joan has always said that her true biography is on film. As you may know, Joan has a very detailed movie library that may look intimidating at first, since it is so long and impressive. A good place to start is her boxed set , which includes some of her greatest movies. Miss Crawford also has a second set  that will be out next year, too. And, I recommend reading Conversations With Joan Crawford, because this book showed the true Joan Crawford. I also recommend these books, as well: A portrait of Joan;: The autobiography of Joan Crawford , Joan Crawford: Her Life in Letters and Joan Crawford, a biography. And there will be a new book about Joan out by Feb. '08, Not the Girl Next Door: Joan Crawford, a Personal Biography; which is supposed be the most accurate and comprehensive biography ever penned!

Shortly before her death, when asked if she would do it all over again, Miss Crawford bluntly said, ""It's difficult to answer that question because part of me believes in Predestination - you know, someone up there is pulling the strings, what ever will be will be."" In the end, after all has been said about her, Joan was just a person looking for some happiness; she just wanted to make it through the night, no different from the rest of us.",1143072000,11,9675,5.564538043478261
417335,5,6301976207,"When I first saw this film, I knew nothing about it,  and, consequently, had no real expectations. The kind of  film it turned out to be, however, I would never in a million years have guessed. This is definitely an unsung gem of a film and one that deserves broader recognition.

The film begins in a penal colony, Devil's Island,  located deep in the heart of French Guiana. This penal colony is filled to capacity with men that the world has forgotten and who live day to day, devoid of hope. Is it any wonder that some of them long to escape? Verne (Clark Gable) is one such prisoner, a petty thief and con artist, who has just come out of solitary, where he was caged like an animal for having tried to do just that.  This roguish and insouciant thief promises the warden that he will try escaping again, even though he has less than three years left on his sentence.

When sent to work upon the docks as part of a chain gang, Verne meets a woman by the name of Julie (Joan Crawford), a dance hall girl who catches his eye. A tough talking broad and graduate of the school of hard knocks, Julie trades barbs with Verne, as she has yet to meet a man whom she can trust. Despite her acid toned words, however, there seems to be a palpable attraction between the two, and Verne has every intention of seeing her again.

Meanwhile, a mysterious stranger, dressed as a prisoner, slips in amongst their ranks. The newcomer, Cambreau (Ian Hunter), seems to know the names of the other prisoners. While the prisoners he encounters claims not to know him, he seems to know them quite well. As Cambreau likes to say, they have met but simply never made a connection. There is a very peaceful and spiritual quality about the Bible toting Cambreau.

Later, a prison break is planned by a hard bitten criminal named Moll (Albert Dekker). With a small band of men,  Moll executes his escape plan, double crossing Verne and leaving him behind at the last minute. Moll escapes, taking with him the religious Telez (Eduardo Giannelli), a killer who prays to be forgiven, Hessler (Paul Lukas), a cool customer who is in the habit of marrying rich women, taking their money, and then killing them, and Cambreau, as well as several others. They must traverse a tropical jungle fraught with multiple dangers before they can reach the shore, where a boat will be lying in wait for them in order to take them to the mainland and freedom.

Back at the prison, in the wake of the discovery of the escape and the ensuing confusion, Verne manages to escape again, hoping to catch up with his nemesis, Moll. Along the way, he runs into Julie who is in a bit of a predicament herself, having been ordered to leave the island for reasons connected to Verne.  Julie and Verne join forces, traversing the jungle and making it through alive. They meet up with Moll and his surviving accomplices on the shores of the beach, where a boat is waiting to take them to freedom. Verne and Moll square off, however, with Verne emerging victorious and taking over the leadership role.

Once on the boat and at sea, further difficulties arise. Under Cambreau's quiet influence, however, a number of epiphanies occur. Even the most hardened of them repent at the last. By the time they get to shore, however, only Cambreau, Julie, Verne, and Hessler remain. They find refuge in the home of a fisherman, whom they entreat to help them.  After refreshing himself, Hessler leaves, unrepentant to the last and looking for a new victim. Cambreau, in bidding him goodbye, tells Hessler that he doubts that they will ever meet again.

Meanwhile, Julie wanders off only to run into the unctuous M'sieu Pig (Peter Lorre), an unsavory little man who knows Julie from the island and has desired her, despite her repeated rebuffs. He follows her, knowing that Verne must be with her, and discovers where they are hiding out. He then  threatens Julie, telling her that he will let the Warden know where he can find Verne, the man whom Julie now realizes that she loves, unless she does his bidding and goes off with him. Julie then decides to make the ultimate sacrifice.

When Verne sees M'sieu Pig and Julie together, he draws the wrong conclusion, and an embittered Verne leaves the mainland with Cambreau, planning to go to Cuba in the fisherman's boat.  While on the boat with Verne, Cambreau finds himself overboard during a storm, and Verne must make a soul-searching decision. What he decides will change not only his life but Julie's, as well.

Based upon the novel by Richard Sale, ""Not Too Narrow, Not Too Deep"". this 1940 film is truly amazing. With its allegorical, religious overtones, compelling story, and unlikely setting, the film almost defies description. Ian Hunter is superlative as the Christ-like Cambreau, infusing the role with a very spiritual quality. It is difficult to believe that the then powerful Legion of Decency condemned this film when it was first released, in part because it believed that Hunter's portrayal of the mystical Cambreau was somehow  not reverent.

Clark Gable is terrific as the roguish Verne, a man who discovers that at the center of his being is a core of good. The exchanges between Verne and Julie are highly charged and passionate, resonating with their chemistry. Joan Crawford`s luminous beauty really comes through in this film, especially in those scenes where she appears to be devoid of make-up. She also displays a touching vulnerability that is central to the character of Julie. Director Frank Borzage outdoes himself with this film, one that I believe to be among his finest. Exacting stellar performances from the entire cast, he not only makes this improbable story  work, he touches  the viewer's heart. Bravo!",1124755200,12,5730,4.720440881763527
417336,4,6301976207,"Joan Crawford plays a woman stranded in Central America, near the infamous Devil's Island penal colony... She finds herself at first repelled and then drawn to Clark Gable, who plays a rugged yet  ethically principled convict.  He is determined to escape, but needs to take along several of his more unsavory cohorts along to make the plan work. Included among them are Peter Lorre, as an oily, untrustworthy smuggler who has the hots for the unwilling Crawford, Paul Lukas as Hessler, Gable's cutthroat rival for power in the escapee band, and Ian Hunter as a fellow known as ""Cambreau,"" a beatific, learned Christ figure whose presence in jail isn't well explained, but who hovers near Gable and acts as his spiritual conscience as ruthlessness and banditry beckon.  Somehow Crawford winds up among the escapees as they slog through the swamps and then cross the ocean towards freedom... The scenes in which Lukas and Gable first debate -- then duel -- over her fate are remarkably raw and foreboding.  The Cambreau subplot -- can men live like Jesus?  Could Christ sway the darkened hearts of modern man? -- is a bit cloying, but the final struggle for Gable's soul at the end is emotionally resonant, and despite the hysterical tenor, one of his most powerful onscreen performances.  A great cast and an unusual script, and oneof Crawford's least irritating performances; she's actually quite appealing in this role.  Worth checking out!",1041465600,23,1441,5.00418410041841
