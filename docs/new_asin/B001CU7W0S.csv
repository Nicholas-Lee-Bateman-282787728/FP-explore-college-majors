8289735,1,B001CU7W0S,Couldn't watch this movie because it consisted of just a few chopped up scenes. It was obviously a reject. At least it didn't work on my player. Maybe there's a secret to how to view it.,1433289600,,186,4.194444444444445

  Story is okay if you love Jackie, which I do!",1260748800,,219,3.8444444444444446
8289737,5,B001CU7W0S,"I bought a big stack of DVDs called ""100 action classics"". The stoolie was one among them and made it easily to the top of the stack as the best flick among the 100 (and there was some serious competition). It is not an aciton picture but a nice romantic comedy, the like they don't make any more. The story starts in Weehawken, New Jersey where the main character makes some money as - you guessed it - a stoolie for a police officer. He runs away to Miami with 7500 Dollars, the department's money he should have passed on to a criminal to compromise him. Once in Miami he starts spending the money fast on fancy clothes etc. - but he still isn't a success with the opposite sex. Until he finds a girl who spends her holidays in Florida in a vain search of romance, and they hit it off. In the meantime the police officer responsible for the Weehawken desaster is in hot pursuit (he has to take a holiday and  travel in his personal car). He catches up with the romantic couple and they start a kind of menage a trois trying to get the money back the stoolie has already spent.

I am aware that all this sounds pretty flat, but the acting and the dialog are really good and amusing. As a European I did not know Jackie Mason before, but I immediately liked his acting stile and his pacing. He is very convincing as the ""walking doormat"" with a low self esteem. I found the romantic scenes between Mason and Marcia Jean Kurtz very sweet - neither of the two are  beautiful in the conventional sense but that has never been an obstacle for true love. Both characters are rater complex and their cicrumstances difficult, but they make an effort to turn the relationship into a success and the viewer can feel with them. The use of locations is very good in this movie, especially Miami is shown from many different angles, I particularly liked the Baroque garden in which the couple takes a walk, a place as enchanted as the whole movie.",1233532800,3,1936,4.372222222222222
