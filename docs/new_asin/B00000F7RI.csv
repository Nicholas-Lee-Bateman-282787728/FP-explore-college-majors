7907478,3,B00000F7RI,"This video is very misleading.  Due to the packaging of this tape, the consumer gets the faulty idea that this is another Commando Cody series. Instead, it is another rehashing of Radar Men From the Moon.  Instead of the 12 chapter serial, what you have here is the reedited version of the serial cut down to 85 minutes with the finished product a short featurette.  In my opinion, if you're able to get your hands on the full 12 chapter serial, you will get a much better idea of the story line.  If you can't get your hands on the serial, then this is your second best opportunity.",1407196800,,583,4.37037037037037
