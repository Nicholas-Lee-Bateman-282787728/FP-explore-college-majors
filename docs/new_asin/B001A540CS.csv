The concert attendees on the beach in Calif. were treated to the impressive vocal style of the first Brit to bring rocking blues interpretations to our shores back in 1964.",1503014400,,278,4.673469387755102
8276028,1,B001A540CS,"Having been a fan of the Animals years ago, I was expecting a sample of the old band's style. I was totally disappointed. It was tailored to suit today's modern bands style nothing like they were back when I was a youngster. I have got a small collection of the old British groups & they are nostalgic, but NOT this one. Even Eric's rendition of the ""House of the rising sun"" was far removed from the band's earlier renditions. I recall that when the ""Moody Blues"" were looking for a lead guitarist, Eric gave them a bunch of applications that he had received, & the one chosen by the Moody Blues was ""Justin Hayward"". I have seen the Moody Blues perform quite recently & they still sound great & still maintain that same sound loved by my generation. Sadly this is no longer the Eric Burdon I was looking forward to seeing. I also have to add the quality of this DVD is extremely poor. If it had been made from old recordings I could understand that but this is comparatively modern recording & is as I said extremely poor. Maybe it is commensurate with our times but Burdon appeared to be somewhat high, & unintelligible. For me this disk was a total waste of money & I would advise anyone looking to hear the old band sound forget it.",1486252800,2,1237,4.3826086956521735

8276032,5,B001A540CS,If you are an Eric Burdon fan you will enjoy this video and the songs that made him famous.  People living in the Los Angeles area of California will know Venice Beach and know the location where this was taped.  Eric is older now but still a great singer and fun to hear his hits again.  Recommend this video for any fan of Eric Burdon and the Animals.,1416268800,2,353,4.161764705882353
