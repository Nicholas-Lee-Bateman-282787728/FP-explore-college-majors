3963296,3,B002OVB9SK,"I already owned the Ultimate Body Vol 1 DVD... when I got this, I was slightly disappointed to discover that the Red level (beginner) was the exact same routine done in Ultimate Body.  However, when I clicked on White level (intermediate)... I was pleasantly surprised.  Not a lot of variation in styles of crunches, but the ""how much can you do in 30 seconds"" mentality really pushes you without you being aware of it.  I rarely have an ab workout cause me to break out in a sweat like that... maybe it was the switching to push-ups, back to sit-ups, back to push-ups, over and over and over... I'm getting energized just thinking about it.

Haven't moved to Blue level (advanced) yet, but I'm giddy with anticipation.

While each level is about 30 minutes, that time includes warm-up and a cooldown.  So really, the ab workout itself is only around 12-14 minutes.  Makes for a good ""I don't really feel like working out, but I know I should do something"" kind of DVD.",1269907200,7,969,4.566473988439307
3963297,4,B002OVB9SK,"I actually just got this DVD yesterday but found this same workout from him ""on demand"" so I purchased the DVD. Did the beginner level yesterday and I'm feeling it today, I did it twice actually. I'm hoping with continued daily use I will see some results. This has to work, the exercises are great and you can really ""feel"" that results are on the way :)",1267574400,4,355,4.313432835820896
3963298,5,B002OVB9SK,"I have been taking Jay's Classes for a while now and I am so excited his dvd is about to launch!  This is an amazing workout.  I plan on buying for myself for the days I can't make it to workout or when I travel.  Also, for a few of my family members that don't live in Dallas!!!!  It is such a great workout for all levels of people.  Whether you just started or have been going for a while, he caters to all!!!",1257811200,5,412,3.857142857142857
3963299,5,B002OVB9SK,"I cant wait to see this video series! I took some of his classes in Dallas and they were GREAT! I travel too much to stay enrolled so I'm glad to have the dvd, so I can workout when I'm on the road too!

AWESOME",1256515200,3,211,3.688888888888889

8376471,5,B002OVB9SK,"I was getting bored of my treadmill, but wanted another workout I could do at home.  This program is really intense, and I love it.  I finished the nine week series, and continue to rotate back and forth between day 4 and 5 of the very last DVD.  The 30-minute workout bonus DVD is also a really good add on to a long walk or jog, because it ads in ab and med ball work.  I really recommend this series.",1388620800,,403,4.0
8376472,3,B002OVB9SK,"Don't get me wrong, this is a GREAT workout.... if you can stick with it. I found myself getting sick of doing the same workouts over and over again, since they only change every 3 weeks. After trying to get through the entire program (9 weeks total) twice, I just couldn't bring myself to press play anymore, it's too repetitive and the workouts take an hour. I have yet to make it to week 4. However, if you have the motivation, I can guarantee this workout will get you results.

I ordered Jillian Michaels 30 day shred following this and I like it much better. The workouts are just as intense, and last only 30 minutes. The workouts change every 10 days instead of every 3 weeks, and I find myself much more motivated.",1388361600,,723,4.395522388059701
8376473,1,B002OVB9SK,I was given a copy of this workout by the President of TAB Fitness Media when I was considering doing some consulting work for this company. The workout is not bad but the company is not at all reputable. I was out of work and took consulting work with this company. I landed them a sweet distribution deal (which event netted them an advance)and created a placement plan for their upcoming DVD releases. The President kept telling me the check is in the mail until their new deal went through and then he stiffed me on what was owed me. He was so nice until the deal went through. He even went so far as to give me a tracking # for the supposed check he sent me. It was a bogus tracking number. I even charged them a very low fee for the work I did since I was just trying to get by while out of work. Don't support companies that would take advantage of people by purchasing their products! There are other good workout programs out there with reputable people backing them!,1298246400,,976,4.281081081081081
8376474,5,B002OVB9SK,"I'm a lifer when it comes to exercise. I've racked up 25 years of 5 to 7-day-a-week exercise. This boot camp 9-week system kicks butt. I'm a 53-year-old woman in great shape and I've always held the philosophy that I need to do traditional cardio (run/bike/swim/aerobics class or cardio machines) 5- 7 times a week and then do weights at least three times a week, then mix in some stretching. This boot camp has changed my mind. There isn't much traditional non-stop steady paced aerobics on here, but I wear a heart-rate monitor and this system keeps my heart rate as high as cardio classes/machines, and then spikes it up much higher than it goes during the traditional cardio sessions. That adds up to great interval training as far as I'm concerned. You'll be doing lots of calisthenics, push ups, ab work, and rapidly moving free weight routines. Believe me this gets your heart pumping and gets you sweating. Jay does go on talking jags for 15-30 seconds and sometimes a minute in between exercise, but I jump rope (without the rope), or jog in place/around the house, or do jumping jacks while he's doing this. Even during these ""resting periods"" your heart beat remains high. This is aerobics using your entire body, working in resistance & weights. This is not dancing around or running around, but for me this is an eye opener. I'm finishing the 9-week course in three days and I look sculped and toned and think I am definitely more fit than I was when I started. I love this system. When I complete the course, I plan on mixing up the sessions, doing a couple of days from week one, then a couple of days from another week. With the variety I don't think I'll be bored anytime soon. In fact now I realize that after 25 years I was bored with traditional hour-long cardio sessions. A word of caution. He repeats phrases over and over...""come on...come on....come on...""  You get the idea. It really annoyed me at first but half-way into the workout I realized I was buying what he is selling, and now I find it inspiring. If it bugs you please look past it and press on. Your body will love you for it.",1294704000,3,2113,4.531413612565445
8376475,4,B002OVB9SK,"I am now in the last week of JJBCF.  I have the results, but the road to here wasn't pretty.  Much like real boot camp, you better be real compliant and tenacious to get through this.  If you're easily bored, this is not the program for you, BUT if that's not an issue, then ""get off your couch and follow"" Jay.
After not having done anything for a few months, I completed Jillian Michael's 30 day shred and decided to purchase the boot camp as a lead up toward another fitness goal; P90X or P90X+.
Included in the 9 week fitness program are 9 DVDs, 9 weekly motivation cards (that I immediately trashed) and a spiral bound fitness manual.  The manual contains the following:
1) a page for your before and after measurements,
2) some pages I didn't read telling me why America's fat
3) more wasted pages telling me why their program will work
4) a thorough explanation of the Army physical fitness test (a two mile run,2 min of pushups and 2 mins. of sit-ups) which you are to take at the end of every phase
5) about 55 pages of exercise descriptions that you'll do during the boot camp
6) log sheets to track your progress for every day you work out during the boot camp
You can tell by the cardio, timed circuits, and the plyometric moves in every session that this is a program that is more designed for those wishing to lose weight, and increase cardiovascular ability, so you'll have to look elsewhere if you're looking to gain muscle mass.  With that being said, my before and after pictures are comparable to the results I had with P90X.  Check it out at workoutathomeguy@blogspot.com
Another note about this program, it won't just ""whip"" you back into shape, it will ""whiplash"" you back into shape! Phase one consists of 3 rotating workouts Legs/abs/cardio, chest/shoulders/tri's/cardio, and back/bi's/abs/cardio.  Workout DVDs don't usually challenge me, even when I haven't worked out in a few months, but the phase one cardio is no joke!  The same cardio workout every day and the same ab workout every other day does get to be repetitive, but by then end of the three weeks you can definitely see your improvement by how much easier the exercises are.
The program has a fitness test that you do at the end of each ""phase"" of boot camp to see if your score improves enough.  If it hasn't, you are supposed to repeat the previous week of boot camp again and retest.  I'll be honest, my sit-ups didn't improve enough, but maybe, just maybe because there's all sorts of cool new ab moves for 30 second intervals, but no actual practicing of 2 min. straight of sit-ups!!
  While we're on the topic of repeating a week of Jay Johnson's Boot Camp Fitness, another reason I wouldn't repeat a week, is that the back/bi's workout for the first 6 weeks is the same, so you are definitely tired of it by the end of phase 2.  Would have been better if they had switched 2nd and 3rd phase's leg workouts around to break it up.
Phases two and three consist of back/bi's/legs and chest/shoulder/tri's workouts that are all timed exercises and they include more pyramid exercises (ex. 10 pushups, 10 squat jacks, then 9 of each, 8 of each, etc.).  You do the same workout every other day for each of the last three weeks!  Since phase two had the same back/bi workout, it made staying with it more like POW camp than boot camp at times.  The third phase leg workout is a disappointment, especially compared to how challenging the leg workout was for the 2nd phase weeks of this thing.  And yes, Jay and Lin still keep talking a lot between exercises and the participants are clapping, but quite frankly I didn't mind, because it gives you a chance to catch your breath between moves and set up your next weights.
Before purchasing, I thought the log book was the program's best feature, in retrospect was its biggest shortcoming.  The idea of the log book was for you to keep track of your personal bests in each exercises and then try to beat them two days later.  The log book, like some of the videos where Jay or Lin aren't sure what exercise is next, is a work in progress (I hope).  There are check boxes for everything: warm-ups, stretching, timed pyramids. Each day's workout starts at a different point on the page and so before every workout, I would have to go back and rewrite all my numbers from the previous similar workout.  It would be better if some of these pointless lines were removed and the log book were set up like a spread sheet with, for example all the back/bi's/legs workouts beside each other, so that your previous workout's totals would be right beside your current workout's column.
In summary, I like the JJHBC's compound movements (ex. combining curls with a squat), the heavy emphasis on jumping exercises and pushups.  Despite its log book ""SNAFU"" and the fact that it can get a little boring going back and forth between only 2 workouts for 3 weeks at a time, just like a piece of fitness equipment, if you use it the results will come.",1294617600,8,4968,4.5459641255605385
8376476,3,B002OVB9SK,"I'm quite satisfied with these DVD's, they get a good start to a regular exercise routine! I like Jay's motivational slogans throughout the series, he's actually pretty funny, They're not super intense workouts but they still get the job done. I'd recommend them!",1291766400,,263,5.1395348837209305
8376477,5,B002OVB9SK,"I found this workout when I was searching for a good Boot Camp DVD to get myself back in shape.  I've been wanting to try P90X but I knew I'd have to be in better shape to get there.  This DVD set does have it's flaws but overall I really enjoyed it.  It's only 9 weeks long.  The workouts are about an hour a day 5 days a week.  There are 3 phases: Red, White & Blue - each lasting 3 weeks and each getting a little bit harder as well as adding more freedom to the exercises.

Pros: The exercises work.  After the Red Phase, most of the exercises are do as many as you can for a set amount of time.  It really gives you room for improvement.  The exercises are hard but still do-able.  Each workout always has someone doing modifications in case you aren't able to do the full moves.  After a few weeks in, I started noticing more muscle definition.  Starting the program I couldn't even do one standard pushup and now I can do plenty.  I can see how I've changed.  I will say that I wasn't as diligent as I could have been - both with doing the workouts 5 days a week, and with my eating.  It took me about 3 months to finish.  That said, I did still lose 10 pounds, and almost 2 inches everywhere that I measured so I'm surely not complaining.

Cons:  Jay does expect you to have read the manual that comes with the DVDs so he doesn't really explain how to do the exercises or proper form.  I didn't really read the manual, and I'm familiar with the proper form of exercises in general so it wasn't hard to learn the moves and be able to do them with the DVD.  Also, Jay tends to waste a lot of time with extra talking which frustrated me because I workout in the mornings and I felt like I was wasting time just standing there.  Also, the exercisers cheer and high five each other after each exercise which gets old pretty quick.  Lin gets a little annoying in some of the workouts because she is constantly pointing out the person who was doing the modifications.  In the White & Blue phases, Jay encourages the exercisers to count out loud which is very distracting because they would go at a different pace than me and I'd lose count so I found myself yelling at my TV my counts so I wouldn't lose track.

Overall those were just some nit-picks I had with the program but I definitely did enjoy it and have finally convinced my husband to try it!",1285200000,6,2353,4.177777777777778
