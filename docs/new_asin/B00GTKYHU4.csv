6112291,5,B00GTKYHU4,"Forbrydelsen (The Killing) Danish;  Octopus - Italian;  Spiral - French
Now I have the fourth best-of-the-best The Bridge

Owning many other ""Region 2"" TV series, none compare to these four.  I loved them all.
 I think The Bridge topped all the others in fast-pace and complexity.",1422057600,3,280,5.0
6112292,5,B00GTKYHU4,"Riveting series, tastefully gory, grotesquely imaginative, weird characters, intriguing mix of police and personal lives. Saga (female detective) is uniquely imagined and  her teamwork with male detective is a side pleasure--part Holmes/Watson, part Abbott/Costello.",1420675200,,266,6.823529411764706
6112293,5,B00GTKYHU4,"Excellent and more! All characters are superbly outlined, with a realistic awarness of their human weaknesses or  lackof.
Saga is the most accomplished  case of  compensated ""emotional intelligence deficiency""  (not necessaruily on the Autism scale such as Asperger as advertised) . Highly recommeded!",1414195200,,301,5.930232558139535

6112295,5,B00GTKYHU4,"Why can't American TV be this good? The closest I have seen coming from the U.S. would be:  1. cable/satellite:  The Wire  2.network:  24.  It makes me wonder that Hollywood thinks viewers have no ability to stay with a plot week-to-week i.e. must have resolution of the story in 60 minutes. Maybe that is true to some extent due to the  nature of social media, internet etc. but I think 24 proved that at least some of us have a normal attention span. In any event, this is a great series. I liked it even better than the original version of ""The Killing"". Saga Noren is a special character. She may be compared to Emily Deschanel's character in ""Bones"", but because of her nature, she inadvertently produces many moments of high humor. Sonja Helin even got to show another side to Saga in the second season i.e. bits of emotion that actually played well to her character.
So buy a reasonable DVD player for all regions (I got a decent one on Amazon by Philips for under $70.00) and be prepared to binge on the original ""The Bridge"" and then look at a few episodes of the U.S. version and shake your head and ask why, why don't directors and producers here get why these shows are so revered in Europe.",1411344000,5,1203,4.420814479638009
6112296,5,B00GTKYHU4,"It's difficult to praise this series enough. The acting and cinematography are superb, and the suspense spell-binding.  Saga Norin is a highly original and extremely interesting character, compellingly portrayed by Sofia Helin.  The abstract stylized manner of the filming of the urban landscapes of Malmo, Sweden, and Copenhagen, Denmark, and the looming presence of the Oresund Bridge adds to the otherworldly atmosphere and the sense that all is not what it seems beneath the clean and gleaming facade of modern Scandinavia.  The gruesomeness of death is evident and is not for children, but it is not gratuitous.  These are murder mysteries, after all.  The sex scenes are likewise fairly explicit but are congruent with the character's lives and not overdone by modern standards, although again are not for children.  The overall tone of this series is very pessimistic, almost nihilistic, and yet so involving that it is a relief to return to real life when the shows end.  The plots may seem far-fetched, but they are no more unbelievable than the real terrorist attacks of 9/11, Madrid, and London, or the anthrax attacks of 2001.

The underlying theme of this series, even more than in other ""Nordic Noir"" series, is the omnipresence of evil in human life and the impossibility of eluding one's fate or destiny, no matter how hard one tries.  This series in particular hasn't the slightest element of Christian or even secular redemption in it, reminds me strongly of the pagan fatalism and bloody-mindedness of the Icelandic sagas.  I don't believe it's an accident that the female protagonist's first name is ""Saga"".

These dvd discs are made for Region Two players, so you can't watch them on a Region One (North American) dvd player.  I watch them using my Windows 8.1 lap top with an HDMI connection to a flat-screen tv, using the VLC media player, a free open-source media player from the VideoLAN Project.  So far, I haven't had any difficulty watching Region Two dvd's using this system.

I haven't seen the American or Anglo-French versions of The Bridge, but it would be difficult to top the originals.

I am looking forward to Season Three and the further adventures of Saga Norin and Martin Rhode.  Seasons One and Two will be hard acts to follow.

8627361,5,B00GTKYHU4,"Not much, but 2 seasons surely is! If you are new to this jointly funded and produced Danish/Swedish masterpiece: how about instead of just dipping your toe in the water, you go ahead and jump in? Because if you watch s1 you'll surely want to watch s2, and buying this bundle saves $$ over buying the 2 seasons separately.
One thing to keep in mind is that a Season 3 has been produced, so feel free to get invested in the characters; however, s3 is set to air overseas in September, and will probably take a while before it becomes available on discs with English subtitles.

Comments:
 At the time of this writing, there are only 5-star reviews written for this 2-season collection of Bron/Broen. Probably not a coincidence. The Bridge can perhaps be considered the Nordic equal of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wire/dp/B00UCOXZLU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wire</a>, which is critically acclaimed as one of the finest American serials ever put out.

 The two protagonists couldn't be more different, yet both excel at their jobs while unknowingly compensating for each other's weaknesses. A trope we're all familiar with, but the magic of this particular matchup churns away in the background as a consistently enjoyable anomaly that serves as more than just comic relief: it's a ""perfect fit.""

 The closest in quality I've seen akin to this Nordic Noir production lately on the small screen is season 2 of True Detective (most notably the gritty shots of California separating the character scenes). I've yet to see the U.S. version (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bridge/dp/B00DVFRSB0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bridge</a>) so can't compare and contrast here, but I'd be surprised if it could match Bron/Broen.",1437868800,,1816,5.633699633699634
8627362,5,B00GTKYHU4,"Doesn't play on ordinary US players.  You need an International Player or you can watch it on your computer via software that's not deterred by Region specificity.  This said, I love the two seasons made of this show.  It's top self in the Swedish and Danish Detective productions.  And it was an alternative to the USA playable DVD's offered for the second season, which I could not obtain without finding the 2nd & 3rd discs damaged by circumferential scratching (I ordered and returned 5 sets of the DVD's).  The Blu-ray's were in perfect condition.",1434326400,,552,4.829787234042553
8627363,5,B00GTKYHU4,"I am so glad to have purchased both Seasons 1 & 2 of ""The Bridge.""  Beautifully written, great stories and characterizations.  Love the ""nordic noir"" detective series in both Denmark, Sweden & Norway - and here you have Denmark & Sweden equally represented.",1431734400,,257,4.953488372093023
8627364,5,B00GTKYHU4,This has got to be one of the best drama series of all time.  It is riveting and seems to be extremely realistic.  The acting is fantastic.,1431302400,,139,4.111111111111111
8627365,5,B00GTKYHU4,"This may be the single most brilliant and compelling TV series I've watched since The Fugitive, and that was a half century ago.

Entirely gripping and arresting, impossible to stop watching, beautifully written, directed and shot... and the acting in every case is superb.

We have been blessed with all these fantastic Scandinavian TV series in the last few years which leave US network productions in the dust, but The Bridge is the ultimate, the Gold Standard. It's a masterpiece, a genuine work of art.

Sofia Helin's performance as the lead character Saga is... well, it's almost beyond description. Unforgettable. Incomparable. Almost alien.",1430265600,,648,5.271844660194175

8627368,5,B00GTKYHU4,"Watched elsewhere, but thought I'd write a review for those checking here. This was very suspensful and well acted. It was definitely engaging and is highly worthy of viewing. The version I watched was not in English, therefore, I used subtitles throughout, but I was still able to follow the story's action well, despite having to read the subtitles.",1424908800,,351,4.966101694915254
8627369,5,B00GTKYHU4,"one of the best all-time series.

I bought an inexpensive all region DVD player to watch this.

The Sopranos, The Wire...add this to the pantheon.

Shipped from England...beautifully packaged...arrived way ahead of time promised.",1424563200,,229,5.676470588235294
