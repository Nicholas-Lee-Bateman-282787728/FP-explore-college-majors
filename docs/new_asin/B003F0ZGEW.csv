Thin Lizzy were a prestigious Irish led rock band that had appeal to acts from other genres. The enigmatic Phil Lynott spearheaded that kudos and that led to recordings with Midge Ure (Rich Kids, Ultravox)-and, this even led to a stint in the band for the Scottish performer. Lizzy even recorded a Christmas single with Sex Pistols Steve Jones and Paul Cook (under the banner of The Greedy Bastards). To add to which Thin Lizzy covers have been recorded by a diverse bunch including Happy Mondays, Curt Smith (Tears for Fears), Belle & Sebastian,  Rollins Band, Dropkick Murphys, Sade, The Cardigans plus a whole host of renowned rockers.

Therefore a live set of the band on their favoured Dublin turf should be of interest to the guitar gusto gang. Lynott's Last Stand: The Final Tour DVD and CD takes in a 1983 Thunder & Lightning tour performance. This stage stamina is even more pertinent as it marks the final filmed display of Lynott before his premature passing away. This is a no holds collection of foot to the pedal power although with more subtle songs such as Dancing in the Moonlight and Whiskey in the Jar plus the beautiful ballad Still in love with You there are changes in tempo. Nonetheless, the core of the roar comes from metal momentum although Thin LIzzy were far more than just loud and proud.

There are also interviews on the DVD (including contributions from group members Brian Robertson and Eric Bell)-and, then it is on to the electric eleven track gig. To add to which an accompanying CD delves deeper in to the diatribe as Phil and also his mum Philomena offer honest and entertaining chat across an hour of bonus material.  For Thin Lizzy fans this product a must but when you assess how Phil Lynott touched so may people from across the sonic spectrum this package has a far wider appeal. The boys were back in town-go savour the energy and enterprise of this colossal concert!",1473552000,,1941,4.6911764705882355
