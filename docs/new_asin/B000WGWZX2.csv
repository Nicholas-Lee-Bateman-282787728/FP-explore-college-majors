2969108,5,B000WGWZX2,I love it. It was what I loved when I was younger and remember it. I also used to use my Black beach criuser bike as it was the black Lion with my brother and other kids that lived on the block.,1200009600,,194,3.642857142857143
2969109,5,B000WGWZX2,"This is a super way to finish of the lion voltron collection, hoping veichle is just as grate!!!",1199664000,,96,4.388888888888889
2969110,5,B000WGWZX2,"The final set of Lion Voltron episodes consists entirely of the additional programs produced in a partnership between World Events Productions and Toei Animation after the original GoLion-based shows ran out.  Therefore, although the stories are mostly excellent, the picture quality falls far short of the high standard set by the previous DVD volumes.  The visuals are often a bit fuzzy and dark, except for the inserted scenes from earlier shows, which are always sharp and bright.  The backgrounds are grainy and the characters are not shaded or highlighted.  Some colors are nearly black (see the supposedly ""Blue"" Cat), while others are too pale (like Princess Allura's formerly hot pink spacesuit).  Nevertheless, the series remains highly entertaining, and even features a brand new villain by the name of Merla.

The 3-DVD Black Lion Collection consists of thirteen episodes, including exciting adventures like these:

""Take a Robot to Lunch"": A brilliant scientist named Marianne dons her canary-colored cloak and leaves her secret underground laboratory on Caspia to visit the monument on Planet Arus that was once her happy home, until Zarkon attacked.  Soon after the orphaned inventor steps out of her pink and silver shuttle, she meets up with her old friend, Coran, and is introduced to the members of the Voltron Force.  The brainy beauty informs the group that yet another of her fantastic creations, a highly advanced super-robot, has been stolen by the sinister forces of Doom and is now being used for evil purposes.  When the Lion pilots offer to get the robot back, Marianne quickly lets them know, in no uncertain terms, that she does not approve of their violent and destructive methods of dealing with problems.

""Who's Flying Blue Lion"": Prince Lotor makes a pact with the sadistic Largo--the one-eyed Barbarian King of the Rogue Galaxy--allowing the blue-skinned fiend to utilize infinite hordes of green and yellow striped Spider Ships and Shark Fighters to bring the Planetary Alliance to its knees, begging for mercy.  Amid his vast army of dark droids, and with the ubiquitous Witch Haggar by his side, Lotor invades Galaxy Garrison, where the Voltron Force is hosting a conference of desperate galaxian leaders.  He quickly takes some hostages, including Coran, and orders Allura to marry him...or else!  Will the fair Princess be forced to join the loathsome pointy-eared Prince in unholy matrimony?

""Enter Merla, Queen of Darkness"": When Zarkon convinces the chivalrous Stride--legendary pilot of the saber-toothed Tiger Fighter--that the guardians of Planet Arus are a threat to the galaxy, the undefeated space knight boards his winged cat-ship and zooms off to challenge Commander Keith and the Black Lion in a duel of claws and swords.  Shortly thereafter, the malevolent blue-lipped telepath, Merla, and her armada of combat-craving minions land at Castle Doom, where the cold-blooded vamp easily manipulates the foul mind of the King in order to obtain Haggar's best and baddest serpent-faced Robeast.  With the green behemoth in her possession, the dastardly Queen heads for Arus with her starfleet, intending to conquer both Stride and the valiant Voltron Force.

""A Ghost of a Chance"": As her pet vulture watches the proceedings from his perch on her left shoulder, the cruel Queen Merla demonstrates her diabolical Cosmotron device on the doubting Cossack, quickly reducing the insolent horn-headed skeptic to a writhing lump of agony.  Later, on Planet Arus, a mysterious woman in purple tells the residents of the Valley of Zohar that the ""Palm of Venus"" dictates that good King Alfor will soon rise from the dead to reclaim his glorious golden shield.  When the lovely Allura learns of the rumored return of her beloved late father, she journeys to the eerie Rainbow Cave to see his statue, only to be trapped within the rocky cavern by a massive boulder!

""To Sooth the Savage Robeast"": Inside her humble home amidst the resplendent flowers and rolling hills of Arus, a heartbroken young beekeeper with tear-streaked cheeks strums her harp and remembers her long lost love, Rowe, who was taken by ultra-droids during one of Zarkon's savage raids.  These days, Rowe is breaking rocks beneath the granite towers of Doom, where he feels the sting of the robot guards' whips on a regular basis.  Ironically, the weary captive's emancipation finally comes at the clawed hands of the devious Queen Merla.  However, Rowe's long-awaited release from enslavement depends upon one condition: Merla will return the prisoner to the arms of his sobbing sweetheart only if he agrees not to interfere while the pale, pink-haired Queen hoodwinks the unsuspecting harpist into delivering a pitcher of poison to Keith at the Castle of Lions.

""With Friends Like You"": The sharp-toothed Count Zane lands on Arus in a stolen Skull Tank after escaping the oppressive forces of Doom, who have recently conquered his brilliant blue home world, Philos.  Once every fifty-two years, Philos' peculiar elliptical orbit brings it dangerously close to Planet Arus, and that fateful hour is fast approaching.  Zane informs the suspicious Voltron Force that the lovesick Prince Lotor is now on the royal Peak of Dargon building a temple dedicated to the object of his affection, Princess Allura.  The amorous tyrant has also constructed a series of anti-lazon missile launchers, which he intends to use to evaporate the stately Castle of Lions as soon as the Philos Comet nears the peaceful Arusian sphere!

Volume Five's extras include a video comic book, a montage of unused Season 3 scenes, and a voiceless ""lost episode.""  There's also a ""History of WEP"" featurette with Ted Koplar.  The remaining features serve to promote the upcoming DVD releases of Vehicle Voltron shows and unedited Japanese GoLion shows.  You'll want to complete your Lion tin collection first though, `cause as you know, you need all five Lions to form Voltron!",1199577600,16,5958,5.180396246089677
2969111,2,B000WGWZX2,"The quality of this seems real bad and often times out of focus which is probably due to the fact that episodes 53 to 72 were done post the original golion series by another animation company.  The only good animation is the ones recycled from the previous original 52 episodes.  The robeasts all appear very uninspired since they are now all beastlike in nature (ie a giant snail?).  They also went full blown cheesy with the dialogue with one instance of King Zarkon referencing the wizard of oz, met by a snappy lame comeback by Keith.  The one saving grace is included.  The trailer for 'King of Beasts: Golion' which is the original anime that was edited to make voltron.  The trailer is quite humorous showing many of the scenes in voltron which were obviously edited to remove death to make it more kid friendly.  It probably won't have the great theme of Voltron or the familiar voice actors, but at least it gives us a chance to see the story unfold unedited and unadulterated.  If you already own the previous four volumes, then you might as well complete your set.  Just realize that after episode 52, it's all downhill.",1199059200,6,1131,4.615
2969112,5,B000WGWZX2,"I am very glad that they are bringing the voltron dvds out faster and  quicker but the only thing is the price

2969135,3,B000WGWZX2,"Don't Buy from the seller Goo Green if you want the Tin (actually I don't think any of the sellers sell this with the tin- your only shot is to look into the used area and if the seller specifies that the tin is included.) even though it shown in the photo. Also liner notes were gone. I failed to read the fine print. The episodes themselves are the ones that were made for American TV exclusively - not part of the Beast King Go-Lion series, but still good nonetheless.

It is partly my fault, I bought this 3 and a half years ago and forgot I had it, so I am just now getting around to watching it, only to find out I cannot.  I have tried for the last 2 months to get in touch with Media Blasters, but they have no contact information on their website, and they will not answer PMs or comment's to their facebook.  So while I love the show, these box sets are bad, but that is due to the company that puts them out and refuses to have customer service.",1435536000,11,612,3.9193548387096775

2969187,2,B000WGWZX2,"I was sitting there minding my own business when I began to feel what I thought was a tremor. I couldn't figure out what the deal was, until I went to change to the next disc, after Lotor and ""Sven"" fall into the newly installed swimming pool, and bam I discover it is the disc. I proceed to put the next disc in and it feels like the King Zarkon robeast is burrowing under my home. I've seen Golion and realize they are all..... well you know, no spoilers. So on top of having dvds making my PS3 vibrate like a back massager, I see what I think to be an error on my part, but wait the VCR is in the other room. The episodes are like a nightmare I have obviously repressed, I don't remember this crap at all. Media Blasters should have saved these for the lost episodes, and kept them lost. A few sheets of toilet paper would have at least warned me or at the least a case made 2/3rds cardboard. The first disc is the only one anyone should watch, then skip straight to the air team box 6 Vehicle Voltron. Be warned!!!",1359763200,,1018,4.1206030150753765

2969204,3,B000WGWZX2,"I love Voltron. Don't let the review title fool you. When I was a kid growing up in the 80s, Voltron was one of my favourite shows along with Real Ghostbusters, Filmation's Ghostbusters, Silverhawks, and Thundercats. The episodes in this final set were made when the show was so popular and everyone wanted more episodes. The studio had run out of episodes of the Japanese shows that they made Voltron from so they went to the people that had made the shows originally and hired them to make original Voltron episodes. Being made a bit after the other shows, these episodes aren't exactly as cool as the ones in the first four sets, but they're still Voltron. DEFINATELY better than the new show of Voltron that just came out. Don't even bother with the new series if you're a fan of the original.",1309392000,9,797,4.580419580419581
2969205,3,B000WGWZX2,"I already have a disapointment with this new 2007 Voltron's DVD series. They removed all deaths, kicks in the nuts(by the princess), bloodsheds and then repeat scenes of people running to fill up the space. In the special features they show you the scenes (not the whole chapter) with a big CENOSRED square...so you never get to see the scenes as we did when kids.

Another deal is the dialog. Many female voices are men pretending to be women, why not replace those lines with real ladies? Want to make it better?..thats the way to improve things the right way..my though.

Anything else, not bad at all(special features). By the way, DO NOT spect the same chapter order, just in case.",1300406400,,686,4.661157024793388

2969210,3,B000WGWZX2,"Voltron Volume 5 is a three-disc set that includes the final thirteen episodes of the Lion Force Voltron series.  There were also two bonus DVDs included in this set: one is a disc containing AnimeWorks trailers, and the other contains a sneak preview of Tweeny Witches.

On this set, there are seven items in the ""Special Features"" menu.  The first is labeled, ""Deleted Scenes From Season 3.""  This features runs for five minutes, and includes some of the shots that didn't make it into the final cut of the episodes that World Events Productions had produced for an additional season of Lion Force Voltron.  The shots and scenes included in this feature include elements that would be too ""cutesy,"" or depict extreme pathos, violence, and killing.  One shot even had a part that could be deemed as ""sexually suggestive.""  Also, many of the shots included here were rather poorly animated.

The next feature is a nearly two minute long preview for the Beast King GoLion DVDs, and it plays up the idea of, ""Did you feel as if you were `missing something' when watching Voltron?""  The third special feature is a preview of Vehicle Voltron, which runs for about nine minutes.

Next is a twelve minute feature about the history of World Events Productions, the company that produced Voltron.  The fifth feature is a ""lost"" episode from the additional season of Lion Force Voltron; it was an episode that had been intended to be part of the newly produced episodes, but production was never completed on it, and this is the first time it had ever been seen by the public.  This episode has sound effects and background music on it, but the dialogue was never dubbed in.  After watching this episode, I can see why it was ""lost.""  The story presented in this episode is rather strange, and the animation was poorly done and contains many mistakes.  This episode really should have stayed ""lost,"" but at the same time, it's an interesting discovery for die-hard Voltron fans to learn that there was an episode that had never been seen before this set was released.

The sixth feature is a preview of the Voltron: Revelations video comic DVD that was released by Eagle One Media.  Personally, I really didn't care for it.  I didn't like the changes to the look and personalities of the characters from Lion Force Voltron.  The final special feature on the set are trailers for other properties released by AnimeWorks.

For fans of Voltron, this set allows you to obtain the final episodes of the Lion Force Voltron series for your DVD collection.  While I didn't care for the ""lost"" episode, it was nice to see that it ended up being included on this set.",1238457600,,2648,4.7254901960784315
2969211,5,B000WGWZX2,you just can't ask for more. This show represents what cartoons are about. good against evil. drama and full of action.cartoons today just don't get it. I know the japanese version is alot more violent so american audiences wouldn't let the kids watch but they cut it up just right. I wish they would let the series out a lot faster but i understand it takes a lot of time to restore the show and the sound. OK but get the vehicle voltron out as soon as possible.

Some colors are nearly black (see the supposedly ""Blue"" Cat), while others are too pale (like Princess Allura's formerly hot pink spacesuit).  Nevertheless, the series remains highly entertaining, and even features a brand new villain by the name of Merla.

The 3-DVD Black Lion Collection consists of thirteen episodes, including exciting adventures like these:

""Take a Robot to Lunch"": A brilliant scientist named Marianne dons her canary-colored cloak and leaves her secret underground laboratory on Caspia to visit the monument on Planet Arus that was once her happy home, until Zarkon attacked.  Soon after the orphaned inventor steps out of her pink and silver shuttle, she meets up with her old friend, Coran, and is introduced to the members of the Voltron Force.  The brainy beauty informs the group that yet another of her fantastic creations, a highly advanced super-robot, has been stolen by the sinister forces of Doom and is now being used for evil purposes.  When the Lion pilots offer to get the robot back, Marianne quickly lets them know, in no uncertain terms, that she does not approve of their violent and destructive methods of dealing with problems.

""Who's Flying Blue Lion"": Prince Lotor makes a pact with the sadistic Largo--the one-eyed Barbarian King of the Rogue Galaxy--allowing the blue-skinned fiend to utilize infinite hordes of green and yellow striped Spider Ships and Shark Fighters to bring the Planetary Alliance to its knees, begging for mercy.  Amid his vast army of dark droids, and with the ubiquitous Witch Haggar by his side, Lotor invades Galaxy Garrison, where the Voltron Force is hosting a conference of desperate galaxian leaders.  He quickly takes some hostages, including Coran, and orders Allura to marry him...or else!  Will the fair Princess be forced to join the loathsome pointy-eared Prince in unholy matrimony?

""Enter Merla, Queen of Darkness"": When Zarkon convinces the chivalrous Stride--legendary pilot of the saber-toothed Tiger Fighter--that the guardians of Planet Arus are a threat to the galaxy, the undefeated space knight boards his winged cat-ship and zooms off to challenge Commander Keith and the Black Lion in a duel of claws and swords.  Shortly thereafter, the malevolent blue-lipped telepath, Merla, and her armada of combat-craving minions land at Castle Doom, where the cold-blooded vamp easily manipulates the foul mind of the King in order to obtain Haggar's best and baddest serpent-faced Robeast.  With the green behemoth in her possession, the dastardly Queen heads for Arus with her starfleet, intending to conquer both Stride and the valiant Voltron Force.

""A Ghost of a Chance"": As her pet vulture watches the proceedings from his perch on her left shoulder, the cruel Queen Merla demonstrates her diabolical Cosmotron device on the doubting Cossack, quickly reducing the insolent horn-headed skeptic to a writhing lump of agony.  Later, on Planet Arus, a mysterious woman in purple tells the residents of the Valley of Zohar that the ""Palm of Venus"" dictates that good King Alfor will soon rise from the dead to reclaim his glorious golden shield.  When the lovely Allura learns of the rumored return of her beloved late father, she journeys to the eerie Rainbow Cave to see his statue, only to be trapped within the rocky cavern by a massive boulder!

""To Sooth the Savage Robeast"": Inside her humble home amidst the resplendent flowers and rolling hills of Arus, a heartbroken young beekeeper with tear-streaked cheeks strums her harp and remembers her long lost love, Rowe, who was taken by ultra-droids during one of Zarkon's savage raids.  These days, Rowe is breaking rocks beneath the granite towers of Doom, where he feels the sting of the robot guards' whips on a regular basis.  Ironically, the weary captive's emancipation finally comes at the clawed hands of the devious Queen Merla.  However, Rowe's long-awaited release from enslavement depends upon one condition: Merla will return the prisoner to the arms of his sobbing sweetheart only if he agrees not to interfere while the pale, pink-haired Queen hoodwinks the unsuspecting harpist into delivering a pitcher of poison to Keith at the Castle of Lions.

""With Friends Like You"": The sharp-toothed Count Zane lands on Arus in a stolen Skull Tank after escaping the oppressive forces of Doom, who have recently conquered his brilliant blue home world, Philos.  Once every fifty-two years, Philos' peculiar elliptical orbit brings it dangerously close to Planet Arus, and that fateful hour is fast approaching.  Zane informs the suspicious Voltron Force that the lovesick Prince Lotor is now on the royal Peak of Dargon building a temple dedicated to the object of his affection, Princess Allura.  The amorous tyrant has also constructed a series of anti-lazon missile launchers, which he intends to use to evaporate the stately Castle of Lions as soon as the Philos Comet nears the peaceful Arusian sphere!

Volume Five's extras include a video comic book, a montage of unused Season 3 scenes, and a voiceless ""lost episode.""  There's also a ""History of WEP"" featurette with Ted Koplar.  The remaining features serve to promote the upcoming DVD releases of Vehicle Voltron shows and unedited Japanese GoLion shows.  You'll want to complete your Lion tin collection first though, `cause as you know, you need all five Lions to form Voltron!",1199577600,16,5958,5.180396246089677
3203608,2,B000WGWZX2,"The quality of this seems real bad and often times out of focus which is probably due to the fact that episodes 53 to 72 were done post the original golion series by another animation company.  The only good animation is the ones recycled from the previous original 52 episodes.  The robeasts all appear very uninspired since they are now all beastlike in nature (ie a giant snail?).  They also went full blown cheesy with the dialogue with one instance of King Zarkon referencing the wizard of oz, met by a snappy lame comeback by Keith.  The one saving grace is included.  The trailer for 'King of Beasts: Golion' which is the original anime that was edited to make voltron.  The trailer is quite humorous showing many of the scenes in voltron which were obviously edited to remove death to make it more kid friendly.  It probably won't have the great theme of Voltron or the familiar voice actors, but at least it gives us a chance to see the story unfold unedited and unadulterated.  If you already own the previous four volumes, then you might as well complete your set.  Just realize that after episode 52, it's all downhill.",1199059200,6,1131,4.615

Also liner notes were gone. I failed to read the fine print.

I have tried for the last 2 months to get in touch with Media Blasters, but they have no contact information on their website, and they will not answer PMs or comment's to their facebook.

3203684,2,B000WGWZX2,"I was sitting there minding my own business when I began to feel what I thought was a tremor. I couldn't figure out what the deal was, until I went to change to the next disc, after Lotor and ""Sven"" fall into the newly installed swimming pool, and bam I discover it is the disc. I proceed to put the next disc in and it feels like the King Zarkon robeast is burrowing under my home. I've seen Golion and realize they are all..... well you know, no spoilers. So on top of having dvds making my PS3 vibrate like a back massager, I see what I think to be an error on my part, but wait the VCR is in the other room. The episodes are like a nightmare I have obviously repressed, I don't remember this crap at all. Media Blasters should have saved these for the lost episodes, and kept them lost. A few sheets of toilet paper would have at least warned me or at the least a case made 2/3rds cardboard.

When I was a kid growing up in the 80s, Voltron was one of my favourite shows along with Real Ghostbusters, Filmation's Ghostbusters, Silverhawks, and Thundercats. The episodes in this final set were made when the show was so popular and everyone wanted more episodes. The studio had run out of episodes of the Japanese shows that they made Voltron from so they went to the people that had made the shows originally and hired them to make original Voltron episodes. Being made a bit after the other shows, these episodes aren't exactly as cool as the ones in the first four sets, but they're still Voltron. DEFINATELY better than the new show of Voltron that just came out. Don't even bother with the new series if you're a fan of the original.",1309392000,9,797,4.580419580419581
3203702,3,B000WGWZX2,"I already have a disapointment with this new 2007 Voltron's DVD series. They removed all deaths, kicks in the nuts(by the princess), bloodsheds and then repeat scenes of people running to fill up the space. In the special features they show you the scenes (not the whole chapter) with a big CENOSRED square...so you never get to see the scenes as we did when kids.

Another deal is the dialog. Many female voices are men pretending to be women, why not replace those lines with real ladies? Want to make it better?..thats the way to improve things the right way..my though.

Anything else, not bad at all(special features). By the way, DO NOT spect the same chapter order, just in case.",1300406400,,686,4.661157024793388

3203707,3,B000WGWZX2,"Voltron Volume 5 is a three-disc set that includes the final thirteen episodes of the Lion Force Voltron series.  There were also two bonus DVDs included in this set: one is a disc containing AnimeWorks trailers, and the other contains a sneak preview of Tweeny Witches.

On this set, there are seven items in the ""Special Features"" menu.  The first is labeled, ""Deleted Scenes From Season 3.""  This features runs for five minutes, and includes some of the shots that didn't make it into the final cut of the episodes that World Events Productions had produced for an additional season of Lion Force Voltron.  The shots and scenes included in this feature include elements that would be too ""cutesy,"" or depict extreme pathos, violence, and killing.  One shot even had a part that could be deemed as ""sexually suggestive.""  Also, many of the shots included here were rather poorly animated.

The next feature is a nearly two minute long preview for the Beast King GoLion DVDs, and it plays up the idea of, ""Did you feel as if you were `missing something' when watching Voltron?""  The third special feature is a preview of Vehicle Voltron, which runs for about nine minutes.

Next is a twelve minute feature about the history of World Events Productions, the company that produced Voltron.  The fifth feature is a ""lost"" episode from the additional season of Lion Force Voltron; it was an episode that had been intended to be part of the newly produced episodes, but production was never completed on it, and this is the first time it had ever been seen by the public.  This episode has sound effects and background music on it, but the dialogue was never dubbed in.  After watching this episode, I can see why it was ""lost.""  The story presented in this episode is rather strange, and the animation was poorly done and contains many mistakes.  This episode really should have stayed ""lost,"" but at the same time, it's an interesting discovery for die-hard Voltron fans to learn that there was an episode that had never been seen before this set was released.

The sixth feature is a preview of the Voltron: Revelations video comic DVD that was released by Eagle One Media.  Personally, I really didn't care for it.  I didn't like the changes to the look and personalities of the characters from Lion Force Voltron.  The final special feature on the set are trailers for other properties released by AnimeWorks.

For fans of Voltron, this set allows you to obtain the final episodes of the Lion Force Voltron series for your DVD collection.  While I didn't care for the ""lost"" episode, it was nice to see that it ended up being included on this set.",1238457600,,2648,4.7254901960784315
3203708,5,B000WGWZX2,you just can't ask for more. This show represents what cartoons are about. good against evil. drama and full of action.cartoons today just don't get it. I know the japanese version is alot more violent so american audiences wouldn't let the kids watch but they cut it up just right. I wish they would let the series out a lot faster but i understand it takes a lot of time to restore the show and the sound. OK but get the vehicle voltron out as soon as possible. I remember as a kid i didn't get to see enough of that series. Anyway good job on the DVDs true fans will not be let down.,1203724800,,586,4.104347826086957

8223292,5,B000WGWZX2,"The last episode leaves a lot of things unfinished. I like that love came softly for Keith & Allura, but during wartime, 9/11 or any crisis, waiting to consummate love & marriage is a bad idea, due to the fact that things can change in the next 5 minutes. Any one of us could be gone in an instant. Merla & Lotor & Zarkon (if caught) should have been arrested & tried for war crimes, despite Merla changing -- we are all accountable for any evil we commit, especially genocide. To me, the source of everyone's problems is the witch Haggar -- somebody should have found her weak spot and taken Haggar OUT. Like any good story, things get a lot worse before they get better, but the last episode left too many things unfinished -- a lot of loose ends are not tied up. They should all be captured and tried for war crimes & the victims in the Pit of Skulls identified by forensic anthropologists and returned to their loved ones. I would have ended it with Haggar being stabbed by a Xionite blade to the heart or some other rare substance that will kill her. After that, I would have had a shock wave cover Planet Doom and turn it into a beautiful place and end it with a memorial concert put on by all the rescued and rehabilitated survivors, and ring a bell, announcing the name of each individual who died there. Anyway, I can't wait for the movie to come out.",1472774400,,1360,4.31640625
