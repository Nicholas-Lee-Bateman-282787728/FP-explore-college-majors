This movie keeps us believing that there really is a soulmate for each and everyone of  us and that we will find that person, probably when we are least expecting  it.  The pain that Alec Bladwin is able to portray in pleading for this  strange ""Rita"" to tell him where his soulmate is has made me a  fan of his ever since.",951868800,6,459,4.101123595505618

Peter Hoskins (Alec Baldwin) meets splendilicious Rita Boyle (Meg Ryan). Inexplicably his heart's desire is taken away from him. Sort of. He now must prove the courage of his convictions for loving Rita.
Meg Ryan at her most appealing! Alec Baldwin's Peter Hoskins is the thinking man's version of Cary Grant's wonderful screwball comedy fellows.

482294,5,6302587263,"This is one of my favorite movies- the chemistry between Alec Baldwin and Meg Ryan is magic.  I'm fans of both, and I think their acting is at its zenith here.  The flicker in Baldwin's eyes as he falls in love, nearly has his heart broken, has different kinds of truth dawn- phenomenal.  I've seen this a dozen times and I delight in it more each time.  Baldwin is about as charming as a man can be- funny and endearing.

Ryan is also a shy, sexy (if neurotic) charmer, and shines in two roles, demonstrating her acting range, but with great subtlety.  Sydney Walker, a veteran of the stage, also does a marvelous acting job, as do both sets of ""parents""- all are spot on.  Yes, the movie is corny, hokey, I don't care, I LOVE IT, everything from Walker's monologue on what matters in life to the final scene, just PERFECT.  What is TRUE love?  For me, this movie captures some of its most important aspects.  It's about generosity of spirit, not taking anything for granted, conquering fear, leaps of faith.  The ultimate romance, full of heart and truth.",1319760000,,1057,4.510526315789473
482295,3,6302587263,"Highlights of this film: Rita's speech about how to savor the gift of life post-transformation, Rita's joy at getting a new lease on life pre-reverse-transformation, Peter's desire for Rita's essence during transformaton, and the perfect on-screen romance between two great actors, Meg and Alec.

Need to watch more than once to take in all the logistics, kinda complicated to appreciate the nuances of true love.  I didn't get it at first with that ONE KISS between Alec and Rita transformed.  Wished the old man was cuter??? Maybe it was intentional to underline the point. I also could not relate to a young vibrant woman seeing a complete elderly stranger and desire his existence.  Yes, she was a quirky, fearful insomniac, but wishing for that exchange is over the top.  Other way around, no sweat!

I was drawn into this film because I could not possibly fathom where they were going with the plot but knew it had to have a happy ending.  Thank goodness I was right and very pleased with all the elements of life,love, happiness elegantly represented. Not for ur typical Romance audience. I was very pleased with the many surprises of emotions.

482299,2,6302587263,"Yipes, the critics and public were right back then! The studio headnicks botched Meg Ryan once again. Unless you had a George Cukor or a Michael Powell on hand, you should never let a ""playright"" transfer his ""baby"" to the screen. The first 20 minutes are some of the most on-target captures of Ryan's lovely playfulness, dancing before a bedazzled Alec Baldwin in the most fetching manner while he underplays it with such reserved bespectacled attachment that charges the party sequence with so much sensuality that you want to scream at the two of them to get it on! Sorry, that doesn't happen. It is as if a special bulletin came on screen and the actors must stand apart for the next boring hour or so, like the 2nd squad must play awhile. As well-intentioned as the writer may have been, this is no allegory or soul-searching thesis on marital reality whatsoever. God, and to make this faux-allegory work to the playright's delight, Alec Baldwin must kiss a man! Is Baldwin paying his college dues here? It is simply not worth summarizing to any length, so preposterous and counter-romantic for those who know what it is like to wait for Ingrid Bergman to connect with Bogart it makes one sick; so wrongly written to waste the beauty of Ryan and manliness of Baldwin in this way. However, the interior shots were exceptional and the bar and party scenes were lusciously scored musically, so attuned to the times and the ""atmosphere"" of that time. As for the rest, pass on it. The public deserves to see these two leads smolder for an entire movie, not separate to fulfill a stage reality. In romantic movies, you dumskis, good-looking people don't waste the audience's time or puzzle them to death. This does.",1282953600,,1714,4.735785953177258

482363,5,6302587263,"I liked this movie, a valuable message wrapped up in a good story line and hey, Meg Ryan and Alec Baldwin ... nice.  However, I wish the guy she 'melded with' had been cast differently (don't know his name) - good actor, but no SPARK.",1203120000,,234,4.2
482364,5,6302587263,"When we tell someone we love them, what do we mean by that?  Do we mean we like the way they look?  Do we mean we like to make love to their body?  Love is a word that is used to describe a lot of very different feelings.

Let's say you are a guy, and you fall in love with a girl and tell her that you will love her forever, no matter what.  Then she turns into an old man.  Will you still love her?  If not, what did you mean in the first place?

Who are we?  Are we our bodies?  Are we the people we see in the mirror?  Or are we something else?  Are we eternal souls inhabiting temporary mortal bodies?  If so, what do we really look like?

Alec Baldwin falls in love with Meg Ryan and marries her.  Before the wedding reception is over, Meg Ryan has traded bodies with an old man.  The woman that Alec Baldwin finds himself honeymooning with is some strange old man in Meg Ryan's body.  It doesn't take Alec long to figure it out, either.  He knows soon enough that this isn't the girl he married.

Will he ever find the real Meg Ryan again, the one now in an old man's body?  How will they react to each other?  Will the two displaced souls ever return to the bodies they were born in?  Why did the transfer happen in the first place?  Is the old man some kind of evil spirit that takes advantage of young people by stealing their bodies when he gets old?

This movie could have been played many ways.  It could have been a horror flick about a demon who possesses the bodies of his victims.  It could have been a very intense and moody story of love and doubt.  Imagine how it would have played out, if a powerful actor like Richard Burton played the Alec Baldwin role, or if a fiery Al Pacino played the role.  As it was, Baldwin did a very bland job of it, but that fit into the overall atmosphere of this movie, which is usually light hearted, not very intense.  It would have made a more powerful statement about love if someone like Richard Burton played the leading male, and it falls into the category of perhaps romantic comedy, or romantic fantasy, with bland Alec Baldwin, but that works too.  I don't know how seriously you want your audience to take this plot, unrealistic as it is, so you may want to downplay it with Alec Baldwin.

Who is kissing who in that title ""kiss""?  Actually, this is a very sweet and romantic movie that may even make you cry.  There may be some realism in it, if we do in fact live on after death, if we are not limited to our current bodies, if our souls can have a gender that is different from our current body.  As for the ability to trade bodies with someone else, so-called ""possession"", I wouldn't bet on it.  I've never heard of a ""near death experience"" that mentions possession.

This movie can be compared to Invasion of the Body Snatchers, All Of Me starring Lily Tomlin and Steve Martin, and even the tv series Wife Swap.  It is fairly close to All Of Me, but the Tomlin-Martin movie is much funnier and sillier.  Lily's soul ends up at times in a bowl of water, and I think in a horse.  I'll never forget the scene where the priest thinks that there is a connection between a toilet flush and the telephone.

As a post-script, who are the morons who gave my review a thumbs down?  It happens to be a great review.  Why would some total moron object to it?",1157587200,5,3316,4.181962025316456
482365,4,6302587263,"It's a good movie, even though oerall it's kinda strange....show's what real romance is",1140998400,4,87,5.285714285714286
482367,4,6302587263,"This movie is yet another entry in the genre that includes two versions of ""Freaky Friday"" and a host of other movie, where two people exchange bodies.  Typically these movies are played for laughs.  However, in this movie the opportunity is taken to explore the meaning of romance and love.

On their wedding day, just moments after their vows, an old man (Sydney Walker) approaches Rita Boyle (Meg Ryan) and Peter Hoskins (Alec Baldwin) and asks if he can kiss the bride.  At that moment the sky darkens, and suddenly the two have exchanged bodies.  The old man walks off abruptly (we learn why at the end of the movie), and all appears as before, except Rita seems a bit different.

Peter and Rita go on their honeymoon, but Rita is clearly not the same person that Peter knew before their wedding.  Rita seems to have different interests, and she hangs around older people.  She also seems disinterested in consummating their marriage.  Eventually Peter figures out that somehow Rita and the old man have exchanged bodies, and Peter must track the old man down.  I dare not reveal more for fear of giving away too much, but the ending is touching, warm and very well done.

This movie takes opportunities that most movies in this narrow genre have not.  The movie explores the true meaning of love, and where love resides.  The movie also explores how well we know someone, and whether we are ready to love someone in even the strangest circumstances.  I rated this movie much higher because of the approach this movie took to love and the relationship between Peter and Rita, and how well this movie pulled it off.  The only scene that made me uncomfortable was where Peter kissed the old man.  Fortunately, the entire scene in its context shows how deeply Peter loved Rita.

This movie has a wonderful supporting cast, including Kathy Bates as the daughter of the old man, Ned Beatty as Rita's father, and Patty Duke as Rita's mother.  I liked each of the three in their roles, but I particularly enjoyed Patty Duke as Mrs. Boyle.

Movies rarely surprise me any more.  I usually at least know generally how the movie will come out.  I suppose I knew how this one would end, but the moral of the story and the tasteful way in which Rita and Peter's relationship was handled, even when Rita was in the old man's body, was nicely done.  I recommend this movie for lovers and romantics everywhere.",1118534400,13,2399,4.6350710900473935
482368,5,6302587263,"Peter Hoskins (Alec Baldwin) and Rita Boyle (Meg Ryan) meet at a party, and it is practically love at first sight. After a whirlwind courtship. they decide to get married. At their wedding, an old man (Sydney Walker) wanders in and kisses the bride. Suddenly, a switch mysteriously takes place. Rita finds her spirit consigned to the body of the old man. The old man, however, gets a new lease on life, as he finds his spirit consigned to the body of the very beautiful and nubile Rita.

On their honeymoon Peter senses that something is not quite right about Rita. It is inexplicable to him that he could have been so mistaken about her. Gone is the Rita with whom he fell in love, his soul mate replaced by a virtual stranger housed in Rita's body. It is from this premise that an allegory on love flows beautifully throughout this film and serves as an insightful commentary on the nature of true love.

When Peter finally is able to figure out what has happened, he contrives to find away a way for Rita to come back to him as she was. You see, he does not love the ""new"" Rita. As lovely as she is, she is not the Rita with whom he fell in love. It is now the old man to whom he is drawn and with whom he has an affinity. It is the old man whose company he now enjoys.

What happens and why certainly gives the viewer food for thought as to the nature of true love.

482369,5,6302587263,"We all know that love should be more than physical attraction, and yet few movies go beyond surface appearance and sugar-coated banter. ""Prelude to a Kiss"" is a wonderful exception to this sad reality. It takes us beyond the usual preditable plot and gives us a rare insight into what is really important about love.
 An enchanting and well-wrought script, supported by excellent performances, creates a movie that will speak to those who listen with their head and their heart.
 Humor, magic, and mystery are interwoven as a husband searches for his wife who is missing but still there. I don't want to give the plot away. Watching the story unfold is part of the movie's charm. I will say that you will be surprised; and, I hope, moved by the message this fine piece of filmaking presents. One of my all time favorites. Don't miss it.",1090972800,9,836,4.680272108843537
482370,3,6302587263,"First off I must say that I'm a big Alec Baldwin and Meg Ryan fan. So when I discovered ""Prelude to a Kiss"" by accident at the rental store, I knew I had to check it out! Two of some of my favorite actors/actresses in one movie, in a romance movie no less! Well... all I can say is that I'm glad I only rented this movie instead of buying it.
Peter Hoskins (Alec Baldwin) cannot pinpoint his attraction to Rita Boyle (Meg Ryan). She has a pessimistic view on life and she has many strange quirks, including never being able to sleep. And yet the two inevitably fall in love and it seems that Peter has found the perfect happiness when Rita agrees to marry him. Yet on their wedding day, a mysterious Old Man (Sydney Walker) comes to the wedding reception and wishing to kiss the bride, Rita allows him to. An innocent kiss, but it wasn't in the slightest. On their honeymoon, Peter cannot get rid of the feeling that Rita is NOT the Rita he knew. Outwardly she is the same, but Peter knows she really isn't. What has happened?
""Prelude to a Kiss"" is for one thing, NOT a romantic/comedy. It is a romance/drama/fantasy since it deals with many supernatural elements. Oh, and another thing, the story isn't really about the 'prelude' of 'a' kiss, it is the prelude AND aftermath of 'the' kiss.
My biggest problem with the story is that it really doesn't seem to flow very well. The pace is slow, from the very beginning where you feel that it might pick up. Unfortunately though, the end is rather luke-warm and just doesn't have the power I expected it to have. Another problem is the sexual content. In my opinion, true love can be better expressed by the main characters NOT having sex. Come on, the best classic romance stories are those where the guy and the girl DON'T have to have sex to show their love and attraction for each other.
It's true that the theme of love is pretty well handled. Before the wedding, the viewers cannot really see if they two main characters are really 'in love' per say. There is an attraction between the two, yet you're not sure if it's love. But after the wedding and the 'occurrence' happens, watchers can see that the two were meant for each other, for their love had passed a crucial test.
The acting is pretty well done, mostly by Alec Baldwin. There is one VERY emotional scene where his character faces the 'fake' Rita and cries straight from his heart for the other to tell him where Rita is. It was an extremely well done and powerful scene, you couldn't help but cry out together with Peter. That has got to be one of the best acting scenes done by Alec Baldwin in my opinion. Meg Ryan is also good as a slightly neurotic and flighty woman who finds love in steady and straigh-forward Peter. She still walks funny though...
Anyway, ""Prelude to a Kiss"" is a very mediocre film. Should be watched for die-hard Baldwin and Ryan fans. But if not, the movie can be easily passed over for some better romance classics. Some Baldiwn or Ryan movie recommendations are",1068940800,10,3005,4.455535390199637
482371,5,6302587263,"Well, this one is a charmer. Silly plot on the surface, but touches on some deep issues regarding love, and the nature of it. Alec Baldwin is superb as the lovesick, then profoundly heartbroken newlywed. The moment when he realizes, truly, that Rita....isn't Rita, and says ""I'm on to you""....will make you cry. I'm an Alec Baldwin fan, I admit, but he is so breathtakingly, stunningly, mindbogglingly beautiful to look at in this film he's almost hard to watch....it's almost painful. Cripes, does he have the most beautiful face on the planet, or what...and that astonishingly thick, cowlicky head of hair....and....and...um..I digress. See it ladies, it will make you ache in the most pleasant way...its a keeper.",1064966400,10,716,5.128205128205129
482372,3,6302587263,"I tried to watch this, I really did.  I mean, Meg is adorable and Alec has nice hair on his chest.  But I just couldn't get interested.  I mean, Meg is cute and kinky (kinky in a nice way of course) and she sincerely worries about bringing children into this troubled world, and Alec's character has had a troubled youth.  So their characters have depth, I'm sure.  And he meets her parents and gets warm with her mom and watches dear old dad's embarrassing antics with his dog tattoos, and they drink beer out of the bottle and you know it's going to be true love and all that.
But somehow I didn't feel any chemistry between them.  I mean how would Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn play this?  (Would they play it?)  How about Tony Randall and Jack Klugman?  What the hey, how about Abbott and Costello?  And then I saw the old guy who was going to kiss her (I knew the premise) and I didn't want to see THAT.  He (Sydney Walker) gets on a train at random and goes to a random destination and is fated to arrive at their wedding at exactly the right time, etc.
Anyway, after a while I figured it was probably just me.  After all, this is Meg Ryan who is adorable and can still play ingenue types at forty-something (she was only 31 when this was released), not to mention that this is adapted from a hit Broadway show of the same name from playwright Craig Lucas.  And I guess I should add that Kathy Bates, who is a fine, fine, underrated actress (how I loved her in the film version of Stephen King's Misery 1990; boy wasn't she a nasty), is going to have a part.  (Turned out to be a small part.)  But still, let's face it,  I'm just not the right guy to fully appreciate such a film.
But then, recalling that I am an intrepid reviewer and realizing I have an obligation to my public who need to see cutesy movies trashed--that, and noticing that today's rerun of Seinfeld is one I've seen three times--I flicked the VCR back on and tried to watch with my eyes closed.  That didn't work, so I tried it with the sound off.  I thought it might be interesting to try and guess what they were doing by just watching.  (You can observe a whole lot by just watching, I've been told.  In fact, Yogi told me that.)  Then I decided I better turn the sound back on because I knew that this kiss by an old man is going to turn the bride into somebody with the mind of the old man or something like that, and I had better catch what's going on.
Okay I'm still hanging in there and this is actually getting good.  No, I mean it.  Meg is now an old man (in her soul) and they're in Jamaica and she's dressing old man weird and loving life and Alec is wondering what happened to the woman he married.
I won't say any more except that Meg handles her new persona rather well, and Alec is very professional.  Still I have to warn you that it gets syrupy at the end and there's a deep layer of what it means to be in love with someone over and above their sexuality--and that's good.  However what really bothered me about this movie was that Meg Ryan was too skinny.  She needs to quit stressing and relax a little, have some chocolate mousse and realize it's okay to be thirty-something then and forty-something now.",1061769600,7,3208,4.243822075782537

482458,4,6302587263,"Okay, okay, I'll give it to everyone that there's a plot twist within this movie that's ""a little hard to swallow"" but as far as romantic comedies go, you can't go wrong here.  Alec Baldwin and Meg Ryan play their roles perfectly and it's nice to see people that are more human than the typically ""perfect"" people we've gotten used to in the movies.  Add to that some great writing and you'll not only enjoy this film as a romantic comedy...it may just stick with you afterwards as the onion layers peel away and the meaningful depths become a way for you to relate to your own life.  See if you don't learn something more about the meaning of that complex four-letter-word ""love"".  Enjoy.",983232000,5,689,4.532258064516129
482459,4,6302587263,"I thoroughly enjoyed Meg Ryan and Alec Baldwin in this- it's cute and romantic, with a magical twist. If you liked Tom Hank's ""Big"" and Sleepless in Seatle you'll like this.",980294400,2,173,4.612903225806452
482460,4,6302587263,"I really like this movie because it is not the ""typical Meg Ryan movie"". It does not have her acting cutesy and adorable. It was not to see her play someone that is very different from the characters that she normally plays. I also liked the old man. He really had the Meg Ryan mannerisms down pact! :-)",977184000,3,303,4.241379310344827

The only reason I  didn't walk out was because of the free air conditioning  in the theather. JUNK JUNK JUNK! Didnt make any sense what so ever. I cant believe it made the big Screen. It wasn't even good enough for TV. I love the actor Alec Baldwin, but this movie i advise him not to put on his resume.",972086400,4,401,3.9875
482462,5,6302587263,"This is one of my favorite movies ever, in no small part due to the chemistry between Meg Ryan and Alec Baldwin. The imperfections of the love between Peter and Rita are what make the relationship more endearing than  the unrealistic sap usually offered up in movies (of course it was a stage  play originally). Don't get me wrong, this movie if definitely off-the-hook  but it is so wonderful to experience a film that doesn't insult our  intelligence and at the same time offers up a truly unique and romantic  storyline that I simply can't say enough about it. The scenes with Peter  and the ""old man"" are hilarious; the actors create a believable  reality that takes you on a strange but lovely ride through their lives.  Some people do not ""get"" this movie, but if you have an off-beat  sense of humour and enjoy movies that do too, get comfy, turn down those  lights and snuggle up to someone special...or take hope that someday you  will meet your Peter or Rita too.",961113600,10,973,4.566473988439307

7827705,5,6302587263,"One of my favorite films, ever! A lot of people did not seem to understand the content of this film. It is a beautiful film with quirky dialogue to fit the basic storyline. A young, gorgeous Meg Ryan is afraid of life and hasn't been able to sleep most of her life because of it. She meets Alec Baldwin who is doing quite well considering the difficult life he has lived so far....
They fall in lust and love and marry. At their wedding reception is an old man who has wandered in by accident. Rita(Meg) and the older gentleman wish they could be in each others shoes and magic steps in to give them their wish. Their spirits switch bodies and Peter(Alec Baldwin) is left to figure out the whole metaphysical mess. It has some beautiful messages about life. Please see this if your open minded and want to feel inspired. Lovely romance included.",1491350400,,845,4.458064516129032
