429420,5,6302148359,".. which unfortunately suffers slightly from Robby Benson's usual balsa performance(wooden & VERY lightweight) but Jack Lemmon is at his best since SAVE THE TIGER and DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES. Robby Benson is at least as good as he was in ODE TO BILLIE JOE. Tucked away in the cast is Gale Garnett, who had a vocal hit in '65 with ""We'll Sing in the Sunshine"", as Lemmon's stripper pal.

I had it on laserdisc, but the player died and so...Anyway, pay attention out there - this is one of Jack Lemmon's best and deserves to be rereleased!",1518998400,,263,4.176470588235294

7821672,5,6302148359,"I had to order this movie twice to get it shipped to our correct home address.  I had been looking for this movie for several years.  It is an excellent story featuring Jack Lemmon, Robby Benson, Lee Remick, Kim Cattrall, etc.  It is a truly touching film from eras long past.  I wish they still made movies like this, but they don't unfortunately.  I am so glad I found it offered by Amazon.",1448150400,,392,4.315068493150685

  This movie stars Jack Lemon and Robbie Benson as a father and son who have major communication problems. Great to watch the drama unfold!

7821675,5,6302148359,"The only downside of this film is that it is not on DVD to reach a larger audience and as a result I had to watch it on friends VHS player which can show American VHS  as I live in the UK. I saw this film twice when it originally came out as I am a great fan of Jack Lemmon and it was just like I had just seen it. It is not a comedy but there are some funny lines, it is a film of tears and laughter and we need both to get life's experience. I also enjoyed watching Lee Remick although in a small part really doing well. Of course Robbie Benson as second lead was great casting.
If this film ever comes out on DVD I will buy it without a second thought.",1379808000,2,655,3.746376811594203
7821676,5,6302148359,"This film is a story about a father who finds out he is dying of cancer and that he doesn't have enough time to live. The challenge is to spend the rest of his life trying to make up with his only son who happens to hate his guts.
A good friend of mine used to say, ""We are just passing through."" and I guess this is what the movie is all about.
A father and a son relationship is precious...please make the most of it.",1235001600,,419,3.883720930232558
7821677,5,6302148359,"This is such a perfect portrait of people I have known who have built emotional moats around their castle of humanity....
Lemmon's character is commited to having no commitment...So busy loving the world he is unable to totally love those who to whom he is closest.
Watch this film with friends and I guarentee you will have one of the greatest discussions you have ever had about all of the implications...A totally human film
Great Song by Barry Manlow heard over the credits sums up the whole idea of the film...",1215907200,3,515,4.670329670329671

And seen under this sad perspective, there are not so much who deserve this effort: that 's the case we have, when a dying father who suffers of cancer wants to reconcile with his son.  Lemon as always gave an unforgettable and touching role.",1129334400,,354,4.53125
