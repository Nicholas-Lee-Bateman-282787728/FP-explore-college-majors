It was not a good buy and I had given it as a gift.",1389398400,,100,3.391304347826087
8027805,4,B0002FAEEK,This video was informative and interesting to anyone thinking of opening their own doggie day care. The interviews were informative and went over many of the things that one may forget or not plan. The visuals of the daycare in action were also very informative.  I think this video was very well done,1285545600,,301,4.679245283018868
8027806,2,B0002FAEEK,"I have done a lot of research for this business and was very disappointed in this expensive DVD. I was hoping the dvd would walk you through some of the logistics and day to day operations of the business. Anyone who has done even a little research would already have this info. Don't waste your money, it gives very little operational information. The money can be better spent on other resources.",1271721600,2,398,4.619718309859155
8027807,5,B0002FAEEK,"This is the best information I've received! Easy to follow, and packed with facts. In addition, I really liked the up close and candid interviews with folks in the business. I'm ready to get my start-up going with realistic expectations. I also found the music and footage of the facilities and doggies nicely paced, well edited, and fun.",1163376000,9,338,4.844827586206897
