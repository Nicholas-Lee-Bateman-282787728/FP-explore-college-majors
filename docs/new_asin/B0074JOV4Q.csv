5054881,4,B0074JOV4Q,"I was a civilian medic a few miles North of this hospital at Kandahar Airfield.  I took my patients there and did some training of the medics that staffed the Emergency Department.  This will be a nice reminder of the folks I worked with there.  I met and worked with some wonderful Dr's, physician assistants and medics there.",1345852800,6,327,4.603448275862069
5054882,2,B0074JOV4Q,"Wanted to like this show about multinational Doctors working in a 'MASH' type hospital in the war zone of Afghanistan; but didn't. The premise has tons of potential and the Actors are all fine, but it just didn't 'grab me' and I'm a fan of most medical shows (House, Nurse Jackie). Sometimes its easy to think the networks are 'idiots' cause they cancel shows after 1 season that are really, really good and I love finding 'gems' like that on Amazon for purchase. And sometimes, they cancel a show like this--and I can see why. Its not horrible, its just not that compelling to spend time watching in my view and somebody else might love it!",1344470400,4,641,4.5344827586206895
5054883,1,B0074JOV4Q,It was not worth my time to return this item and donated it instead. The quality was poor and where it was made should be ashamed of there work.,1343260800,,144,4.0
5054884,4,B0074JOV4Q,"Once dubbed as ""the nakedest person in TV history.""  But I digress.  This Canadian produced drama provides a realistic look at a front line combat hospital.

I wouldn't call Combat Hospital (CH) ""Mash"" for the next generation, as while there are comedic moments, CH is much more of drama where doctors of multiple nationalities, deal with patients, family back home, being in Afghanistan and each other.

In my opinion the production value and cast is excellent.  CH appeared on ABC as a late season replacement and slipped under my radar.  I caught up with CH thanks to my ""on-demand"" during the TV ""dog days"" of the summer.

Truth be told, I don't particularly gravitate towards medical dramas.  Watch CH for the storylines, casting and production values.  Lusting after Michelle Borth is just an ancillary bonus =:)",1338249600,6,818,4.955882352941177
5054885,5,B0074JOV4Q,"I enjoy seeing movies about combat and about the people who work to keep our soldiers alive. This movie talks about the doctors and nurses, their personal lives, and how their work affects them emotionally. Would recommend it.",1336176000,3,226,4.973684210526316
5054916,5,B0074JOV4Q,"Great show, showing a realistic portrayal of life as a military doctor in Afghanistan. Each episode addresses the realities of life and war, giving you a look into situations you may not be familiar with. (If you are familiar, I thank you truly.) This is another example of a show with real potential being canceled after only one season. I'm sorry it was canceled, but I enjoyed the one season produced. I definitely recommend this one season series.",1405382400,2,451,4.794871794871795
5054917,5,B0074JOV4Q,"This contains SPOILERs. I found to be Fantastic. I watched done if these when they were airing, but to watch the whole season as one block makes for some powerful tv, especially when a character you love is killed. I bawled.",1401840000,2,224,4.487804878048781
5054918,5,B0074JOV4Q,"It is a great series, unusual, but with great characters. Really well put together. Can't wait for the next series.",1383436800,,115,4.8
5054919,5,B0074JOV4Q,"Great series! It's just too bad it only lasted one  season, I bought while working as nurse in Afghanistan so I could identify with it...helps the viewer get an idea of what things are like in the ""Stan"".",1380672000,,204,4.368421052631579
5054920,4,B0074JOV4Q,"Package arrived in timely manner as promise. Product was in good condition as expected. The film is about reality how it was in combat zone and climate, activities is very realistic.",1377993600,,182,4.903225806451613
5054921,5,B0074JOV4Q,This series was wonderful.  You get to feel for the characters involved like a modern day M*A*S*H*.  Very unfortunate that it was cancelled after one season....,1376006400,,160,5.115384615384615
5054922,4,B0074JOV4Q,a decent canadian attempt at a field hospital in afghanistan. thankfully it is NOTHING like MASH!  decent writing and plots. some great acting actually i liked it.,1368144000,,163,5.037037037037037
5054923,5,B0074JOV4Q,"I love the show as it is extremely touching and fast pace.  I would recommend this show to most anyone especially my friends.  On top of which, the seller has shipped it to me fast and I received it before the actual timing.",1367452800,4,224,4.186046511627907
5054924,5,B0074JOV4Q,"This was a very good television program that did not receive the recognition and ratings it deserved. Viewers actually cared about these characters and would have liked for their story to continue. With these DVDs, fans can at least rewatch the sole season that aired. I would also recommend this to fans of other tv shows like MASH, CHINA BEACH, TOUR OF DUTY, etc. or anyone who knows someone or has a family member who served in the Middle East. At times it is uncomfortable to watch as it portrays a combat hospital and therefore injuries and casualties of war. But it also shows the dedication of the medical staff.",1354665600,5,619,4.636363636363637
5054925,5,B0074JOV4Q,I really liked this show. The cast is great and I thought the episodes were really well done. The only thing I didn't like was running out of episodes to watch.,1346803200,7,160,4.193548387096774

8510110,5,B0074JOV4Q,"I haven't been in the Middle East but I've been in the military and find this series mostly believable and very interesting. Good character building and the story lines aren't over-the-top. Not sure how true to life they are but, speaking as a lay person, they seem plausible and, if nothing else, they are compelling. Recommended.",1487635200,,331,4.928571428571429

8510114,5,B0074JOV4Q,Exceptional series. It should never have been cancelled. I cannot recommend it highly enough!,1434499200,,93,5.714285714285714
8510115,5,B0074JOV4Q,"Great drama! The show was very well cast, and the stories are gritty and realistic.  Also nice to have a Canadian element to the snow.
Highly recommend you buy it!",1431129600,2,163,4.433333333333334
8510116,5,B0074JOV4Q,Great show. Discs arrived and work great.,1430870400,,41,5.0
8510117,5,B0074JOV4Q,"From the day I heard that the show had not been picked
up for a second season, I still wonder, just what happened.
The network claimed, it had low ratings, and that they had
another show for it's time slot.
Did Combat Hospital, step on too many toes?
Did they touch on topics that were ""off limits""?
Did the mention of ""Govt Contract"" workers, cause some people
to get uncomfortable?
Did the Special Forces episodes cause undue reactions?
Unlike, China Beach, which was an after product of the Vietnam
War, Combat Hospital, covers things and issues concerning a War
that is still on going, and people don't wish to see war as it is happening.
I watched the show when it aired, and have watched all of the episodes
over again, and yes, it pulls no punches.
Pity that it only ran for one season.",1427241600,3,793,4.475862068965517
