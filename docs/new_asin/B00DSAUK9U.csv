8597101,3,B00DSAUK9U,"It's a fun anime with a gambling theme of all the backdrops one could think of. I saw this in Japanese and thought the English language re-do would be good.

My main issue is with the DVD set. It flat out won't play and it appears to be a cheap DVD-r copy, not a properly made commercial disc set production. Anime works has been known to do this all the time so I will be much less likely to get any more of their titles.",1518825600,,422,3.9647058823529413
8597102,3,B00DSAUK9U,"Update 2: Got the Blu-ray version this time around. It has some playback issues. It starts of in sub mode every episode and have to manually switch it to dub mode. Same applies to the sub-text which is stuck on when first starting. the Slates don't do anything

Review of the anime itself:
One of the better animes that revolve around gambling. The story line is light but character development on the main cast is thought out. secondary characters don't really get any development. Overall, it wasn't the best but it was worth watching.

P.S. Beware of excess fan-service

Update: Received second copy of DVD, same issues...

Don't know if its just me, but at least the copy I received was faulty. Tried to play it on a PS3, PS4, XBox 360, and Xbox One and none of them would recognize the disc. Will update when replacement is received.",1496880000,,838,4.604026845637584

8597105,1,B00DSAUK9U,"the storyline is almost non-existent.  Little action, drama, romance or anything else.  Basically a story of how a card dealer has to win special cards to get some kind title as grand dealer or something that gives that person power to control luck.  The main character's boss pretty much forces her into matches wearing skimpy and revealing clothes, but the fan service isn't revealing enough to overcome the shows major shortcomings.  It has a tv13 rating.",1430179200,2,458,4.9868421052631575
