3105843,2,B0013FSL16,"The first episode is the only good episode of the season. The whole point of  season 5 seems to be how far the writers can go in shocking the viewer. All the characters seem to have regressed to grade school mentality.

Seasons 1 & 2 are the only seasons to watch IMHO. I kept watching Season 5 hoping it would get better.

It never did.",1208563200,9,337,4.153846153846154
3105844,5,B0013FSL16,I started watching Nip Tuck while in college. A roommate turned me onto the show. she let me barrow all the DVDs she had up to season 3 and i binged watched them immediately. the show was the greatest to me. two drs rich just the right amount of sexuality.

Loved, loved , loved, Kimber....wow.  Great music, and while shot in Long beach posing as Miami, what a wonderfully twisted show.

I even had a name plate of Christian Troy made for a Halloween Costume and wore it with scrubs. There was a meet and greet with the stars at Hollywood and Highland. Fun.",1428451200,,465,4.458823529411765

3105901,4,B0013FSL16,"Been a fan of Nip/Tuck since ssn 1 and ssn 5 did not disappoint. Loved the change of scenery! But the bad luck sure did pile up over the years because these people catch hell. There are more accidents, stabbings,and random acts of evil than a group of people should have to endure...sucks that i didn't get part 2",1316476800,,313,4.322033898305085

3105903,5,B0013FSL16,"After much thinking, I have finally figured out the system the writers of this show must have: 5 boxes on a table.  Box #1 contains character names on slips of paper. #2 contains couples on the slips. #3  has various acts of treachery on the paper slips.  Box #4 contains slips with various diversified sex acts on them.  And Box #5 contains slips with Plastic Surgery operations such as penile enlargement, breast reduction, etc.  Take a slip at random from #1 and match it to a slip from #5.  Take another slip from #1 and  match with a slip from #3.  Get 3 slips from  #2 and match them up (at random, of course) with 3 slips from Box #4. And there's your show.  The contrast is amazing--fabulous actors giving reality to a storyline that spins and careers out of control!
This season features a wide selection of troublesome women. There's the Monroe-ish Kimber, who has a heart the size and temperature of a frozen pea,  and has an ego with the size and toxic atmosphere of Jupiter. There's Colleen, a ""stuffy"" old hag. Kate is the ultimate drag: she goes around with an unhappy look on her face, and Sean spends 99% of his time talking, trying to get her to smile. When she does, the smile disappears after 3 seconds. Definitely a high-maintenance relationship.  Julia also spends the season having a hysterical fit every 5 minutes. She upbraids Sean for his infidelities while she cheats on him. When she finally gets her comeuppance, I almost feel like cheering.  But the real dark-entity of this piece is Eden: an evil trollop par excellence. Eden's narcissistic ego rivals Kimber's, but unlike Kimber she has no heart. She gives psychopaths a bad name. She can't screw over enough people fast enough, and her mother Olivia is as stupid as she is rich.  The potty-mouthed Gina also puts in an appearance again, just to strike fear into Christian Troy's heart. Add to this about 100 lies, several murders, some gory operation scenes, and mix well, for a show that truly entices.
In this season, Liz Cruz shines as never before. She is the stable anchor to the madness going on all around her and it's when Liz is on camera, that the audience knows that reason will somehow prevail. This is a good season, even worth the 2-part cost.",1292716800,,2240,4.609571788413098
3105904,4,B0013FSL16,"Why does the character ""Matt"" look like a tranny version of Michael Jackson ?  Oh my.  His wig is horrible and he looks like poo poo.  Well, I actually like the show.  just a quick observation about that character.",1287014400,,214,4.410256410256411
3105905,3,B0013FSL16,"I have to say I was disappointed when they decided to break the season into 2 sections. Being the last I guess they had to pay someone.

3105906,3,B0013FSL16,"The show took a drastic turn for the worse in Season 5 part 1.

3105908,1,B0013FSL16,"Take the best-written show in history and watch it BURN before your eyes in season 5!!  I was seriously flabbergasted while watching ""Nip Tuck"" disintegrate.  Such a disappointment, and so sad it's not even funny.  This show was the best before, and my absolute favorite.  They should have NEVER moved to LA, and the network should have NEVER ordered 22 episodes -- the writers obviously couldn't handle it.
NOTHING makes sense.  ""Let's throw everything against the wall and see what sticks,"" basically.  Sadly, nothing sticks.  Too many vapid characters coming and going, no real storyline, and why the eff doesn't Julia show up at Christian's wedding btw??
I don't know the characters anymore, and I'm super pissed at Gina's death (which hits an all-time high on the super-ridiculous meter).  Haven't seen season 6 yet, but I'm not holding my breath (at the same time, season 5 is so ridiculously bad it can't get any worse, right?).",1274313600,3,935,4.948717948717949

3105922,5,B0013FSL16,"""Nip/Tuck"" returns for another wonderful season with a brand new locale. Creator and producer Ryan Murphy wisely decided to keep the series fresh by moving ""Nip/Tuck"" to Hollywood where Christian and Sean move their plastic surgery practice. Other series regulars like Matt, Liz, Kimber, and Julia are along for the ride and the series looks fresh and innovative. Most TV dramas become boring and sluggish in their fifth year, but by moving our beloved ""Nip/Tuck"" to the Southland gives the show real newness and originality in their plotlines and characters. Besides what better place to have a show set that deals with plastic surgery than Los Angeles? There are also a slew of great guest-stars that pop up this year including John Schneider, who plays a porn producer, and Rosie O'Donnel who reprises her role as Dawn Budge. However, it is Sharon Gless' virtuoso performance as a so-called agent that steals the spotlight this year. To say that Gless' performance is blood curdling is an understatement. She even received an Emmy nomination for her role.
 This boxset features the first 14 episodes that were filmed in season 5. There was originally suppose to be 22 shows filmed that year but due to a writer's strike only 14 were shot. The 8 remaining shows from season 5 are being released in October, 2009 in a separate set called ""Nip/Tuck-Season 5, Part 2"". I am sure that in time a complete Season 5 boxset will be released. However, if you can't wait to view these 14 shows, like me, buy this set: these  episodes are some of the best the series has made!
 On a final note ""Nip/Tuck"" went dark on June 19th, 2009, meaning the show finished filming permanently. The series returns to the airwaves October, 2009.",1247788800,,1722,4.8108108108108105

3105929,1,B0013FSL16,"Nip and Tuck is just a TV show, the fact that we buy the dvd means its good enough to add to our libraries.  Manufacturers take advantage of this market three ways to sunday.  First we have Sony putting out the first season to dozens of shows and then not following up with the rest of the seasons. Thus leaving our libraries incomplete. Then we have writers striking for better wages and manufacturers use this as an excuse to sell mediocre packages of media at prime prices. Now we have half of a season selling at the price of what it would cost to purchase the complete season. All in all, there are laws to put us away for smoking too close to a building and spitting on the sidewalk but manufacturers can get away with manipulating sales by how they put out materials. Where is the law that protects the customer. The law that says, hey you promise quality goods and you get paid for it, so pony up boys, pony up and give quality where quality is due. Sony, Fox or michael jackson and anyone else that has cornered the market on media manipulation should be held accountable. So no, I am not giving my hard earned cash to Amazon or anybody else for half a box of media. It makes no sense at all, and I am sure that their sales must be reflecting this if the american public is as fed up as I am with this media hazing.",1235260800,3,1324,4.229249011857707

Extremely bizarre of course, and even slightly depressing at times. But why did I keep watching?  I guess because of that bizarre edge, you never really know what the heck is coming around the corner. One thing I will say is that all the sex scenes were distracting to me.  They seemed contrived.

Julia has a life transformation (I won't spoil it for you) that I found extraordinarily silly~but that's just me.  Christian seems to be sinking into the gutter deeper and deeper.  Sean's temper becomes a major focus.  And Matt and Kimber are as delightfully dysfunctional as ever.  I give this season four stars.",1233705600,2,841,4.784722222222222

The move from Miami to Hollywood provided a change of scene, the opportunity for new characters, and the chance for Sean and Christian to develop further.  And then two horrible things happened: Julia and Matt returned.  And with them, all the whining that peppered the last season.  And then Gina?  C'mon! Things became so ridiculous that by the time Julia developed amnesia, I was laughing aloud and thinking I tuned into ""As the World Turns"" by accident.

3105942,3,B0013FSL16,"I had been waiting for the fifth season to come out on DVD for a while, but I had also forgotten that the writer's strike cut many shows short that season.  Nip/Tuck was one of those.  I was looking forward to seeing how the show picked up since season 4 ended with basically everything in the show changing (the divorce, Julia moving to NY, Sean moving to LA, selling the business, Matt and Kimber having a baby, etc.).  Within the first three episodes of this season I was hooked.  The first episode connected the frayed ends of the last episode of Season 4 with enough clarity to make it entertaining and believable.  However after that it becomes quickly apparent that the strike had an adverse affect on the continuity of the show.  Only the episodes that were completed were shot, leaving gaps in the action between episodes.  One episode would end with a character hanging in the balance, then the next 2 episodes would mention nothing of that character, and then finally that character would miraculously re-appear.  With the continuity broken it leaves you wondering time and again when they'll get back to the plot line involving said character.  And there are so many different plot lines going on that 14 episodes is obviously not enough to cover it all (8 more were scheduled for shooting for a total of 22).  The sheer number of happenings keeps you hooked, but the lack of depth in many of them leaves you disappointed when they get resolved.  So much happens in this season that I doubt even 22 episodes could have clearly resolved them (or even set them up for the Sixth Season without creating gaps).  In all this is a definite must watch for any fan of the series, but don't be expecting the Greatness that was Seasons 1 & 2 and to a lesser extent 3 & 4.  Season 5 was just another victim of the writer's strike and hopefully many of the issues left open by the strike can be corrected in the following season.",1232668800,,1929,4.540462427745664
3105943,4,B0013FSL16,"WOW, I can't believe Season 5 received so many bad reviews. Our favorite bad guy, Christian Troy, as well as his sexually deviant side kick Kimber, is up to their old tricks. The Julia McNamara character is as socially helpless as ever and Sean is struggling with being the consummate doormat. The Matt character got a chance to spread his acting wings (although I'm glad he didn't go thru with the gay sex scene). I hate to see the Gina character released because I loved her sexually needy character. The Eden character was a nice addition to the storyline and John Schneider, turns in some convincing performances as porn king Ram Peters. For all those sour puss reviewers, the underlying theme of the show has always been superficiality (or the fulfillment of needs thru superficial means) that's why the show started off in Miami, and moved to Los Angeles. The show is about need, loneliness, inferiority issues, sexual abuse and damaged souls; shouldn't we expect a little craziness? Of course we should! I haven't watched the special features portion of the set yet, but I was dying to finish the season first. I think this season is a keeper.",1232064000,,1150,4.78391959798995

There's some inventive twists that are abound, including the downward spiral that Matt (John Hensley) and Kimber (Kelly Carlson) are on, and Julia's (Joely Richardson) surprising new realationship.  There's pivotal guest star roles from Portia de Rossi, John Schneider, and sexy AnnaLynne McCord, and Nip/Tuck still manages to be entertaining five seasons in, even though this season just simply isn't as good as previous seasons of the series.

3105950,5,B0013FSL16,"First, let me say that in all honesty, I honestly thought that this season of ""Nip/Tuck"" was going to fail, simply because Seasons 3 & 4 were huge disappointments. I was shocked at the new level that the writers/producers of this show has taken it to and I enjoyed every bit of it.

The doctors and their families, friends and colleagues all move to California, where they not only continue their practices, but they discover a large multiple of ups and downs. I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't seen this season, but I'll just add that this season covers a ""new"" sexual phenomenon in white suburbia (which is called ""Cuckoldry""), reality TV, female stalkers, Julia exploring her sexuality, characters Matt & Julia hitting rock bottom, Kimber going back into her old ways by becoming a porn starlet and an 18-year-old temptress named ""Eden"" causing friction in Sean and Julia's life. In this season, things go downhill for just about everyone and just when you think things are going well for the characters in this story, things get uglier and uglier! In this season, there are special guest appearances by porn-star Lexington Steele, Boris Kodjoe, ""New York"" (from the ""Flavor of Love"" show), Tia Carrere, Rosie O'Donnell, etc...

While Season Two was my most personal favorite season for ""Nip/Tuck"", this season is equivalent to that particular season, because Season Five was so damn entertaining, just like Season Two and I loved it! I just hope that Season Six (the final season, maybe?) will be as great as this one.",1211587200,13,1534,4.851145038167939

(most likely due to the wrighters strike we're all so familiar with) so for those that feel there was no closure, you're right, there wasn't any, because that was never supposed to be the close, they just aired the ones they had finished.

while i agree, the plots have gotten more and more shocking, and less about the surgery and the subtlties of the charecter relationships, i have to keep my fingers crossed that by the end of the season (the missing episodes rumored to be airing early this fall, possibly late summer) things will turn around a bit and get more involved, and less trashy.

never the less, i'm gonna buy it, i plan to support my favorite show, leave my input, and hope it gets back to some taste.

On the good side: (1) some attempts at satire of the series  (2) many guest stars (3) interesting cliffhanger;  The bad: (1) some plots that were so ridiculous that I laughed out loud (one character's death in the middle of the season was so ridiculous that I thought it was a dream at first!) (2) fewer and less interesting surgeries than the other seasons  (3) many unresolved plot lines and far less overall coherance than the other seasons (4) the villain did not get their just desserts (yet) - usually the series concludes with some kind of closure, but there was no closure of any of the plot lines! (5) the other seasons were provocative, but this season was just trashy (e.g., ""gasp, it's a swinger's party"" - but we already saw something similar in Season 1) (6) far less use of characters such as Julia and Liz.

3340400,5,B0013FSL16,"After much thinking, I have finally figured out the system the writers of this show must have: 5 boxes on a table.  Box #1 contains character names on slips of paper. #2 contains couples on the slips. #3  has various acts of treachery on the paper slips.  Box #4 contains slips with various diversified sex acts on them.  And Box #5 contains slips with Plastic Surgery operations such as penile enlargement, breast reduction, etc.  Take a slip at random from #1 and match it to a slip from #5.  Take another slip from #1 and  match with a slip from #3.  Get 3 slips from  #2 and match them up (at random, of course) with 3 slips from Box #4. And there's your show.  The contrast is amazing--fabulous actors giving reality to a storyline that spins and careers out of control!
This season features a wide selection of troublesome women. There's the Monroe-ish Kimber, who has a heart the size and temperature of a frozen pea,  and has an ego with the size and toxic atmosphere of Jupiter. There's Colleen, a ""stuffy"" old hag. Kate is the ultimate drag: she goes around with an unhappy look on her face, and Sean spends 99% of his time talking, trying to get her to smile. When she does, the smile disappears after 3 seconds. Definitely a high-maintenance relationship.  Julia also spends the season having a hysterical fit every 5 minutes. She upbraids Sean for his infidelities while she cheats on him. When she finally gets her comeuppance, I almost feel like cheering.  But the real dark-entity of this piece is Eden: an evil trollop par excellence. Eden's narcissistic ego rivals Kimber's, but unlike Kimber she has no heart. She gives psychopaths a bad name. She can't screw over enough people fast enough, and her mother Olivia is as stupid as she is rich.  The potty-mouthed Gina also puts in an appearance again, just to strike fear into Christian Troy's heart. Add to this about 100 lies, several murders, some gory operation scenes, and mix well, for a show that truly entices.
In this season, Liz Cruz shines as never before. She is the stable anchor to the madness going on all around her and it's when Liz is on camera, that the audience knows that reason will somehow prevail. This is a good season, even worth the 2-part cost.",1292716800,,2240,4.609571788413098

Such a disappointment, and so sad it's not even funny.  This show was the best before, and my absolute favorite.  They should have NEVER moved to LA, and the network should have NEVER ordered 22 episodes -- the writers obviously couldn't handle it.
NOTHING makes sense.  ""Let's throw everything against the wall and see what sticks,"" basically.  Sadly, nothing sticks.  Too many vapid characters coming and going, no real storyline, and why the eff doesn't Julia show up at Christian's wedding btw??
I don't know the characters anymore, and I'm super pissed at Gina's death (which hits an all-time high on the super-ridiculous meter).

3340419,5,B0013FSL16,"""Nip/Tuck"" returns for another wonderful season with a brand new locale. Creator and producer Ryan Murphy wisely decided to keep the series fresh by moving ""Nip/Tuck"" to Hollywood where Christian and Sean move their plastic surgery practice. Other series regulars like Matt, Liz, Kimber, and Julia are along for the ride and the series looks fresh and innovative. Most TV dramas become boring and sluggish in their fifth year, but by moving our beloved ""Nip/Tuck"" to the Southland gives the show real newness and originality in their plotlines and characters. Besides what better place to have a show set that deals with plastic surgery than Los Angeles? There are also a slew of great guest-stars that pop up this year including John Schneider, who plays a porn producer, and Rosie O'Donnel who reprises her role as Dawn Budge. However, it is Sharon Gless' virtuoso performance as a so-called agent that steals the spotlight this year. To say that Gless' performance is blood curdling is an understatement. She even received an Emmy nomination for her role.
 This boxset features the first 14 episodes that were filmed in season 5. There was originally suppose to be 22 shows filmed that year but due to a writer's strike only 14 were shot. The 8 remaining shows from season 5 are being released in October, 2009 in a separate set called ""Nip/Tuck-Season 5, Part 2"". I am sure that in time a complete Season 5 boxset will be released. However, if you can't wait to view these 14 shows, like me, buy this set: these  episodes are some of the best the series has made!
 On a final note ""Nip/Tuck"" went dark on June 19th, 2009, meaning the show finished filming permanently. The series returns to the airwaves October, 2009.",1247788800,,1722,4.8108108108108105

3340426,1,B0013FSL16,"Nip and Tuck is just a TV show, the fact that we buy the dvd means its good enough to add to our libraries.  Manufacturers take advantage of this market three ways to sunday.  First we have Sony putting out the first season to dozens of shows and then not following up with the rest of the seasons. Thus leaving our libraries incomplete. Then we have writers striking for better wages and manufacturers use this as an excuse to sell mediocre packages of media at prime prices. Now we have half of a season selling at the price of what it would cost to purchase the complete season. All in all, there are laws to put us away for smoking too close to a building and spitting on the sidewalk but manufacturers can get away with manipulating sales by how they put out materials. Where is the law that protects the customer. The law that says, hey you promise quality goods and you get paid for it, so pony up boys, pony up and give quality where quality is due. Sony, Fox or michael jackson and anyone else that has cornered the market on media manipulation should be held accountable. So no, I am not giving my hard earned cash to Amazon or anybody else for half a box of media. It makes no sense at all, and I am sure that their sales must be reflecting this if the american public is as fed up as I am with this media hazing.",1235260800,3,1324,4.229249011857707

Extremely bizarre of course, and even slightly depressing at times. But why did I keep watching?  I guess because of that bizarre edge, you never really know what the heck is coming around the corner. One thing I will say is that all the sex scenes were distracting to me.  They seemed contrived.

Julia has a life transformation (I won't spoil it for you) that I found extraordinarily silly~but that's just me.  Christian seems to be sinking into the gutter deeper and deeper.

3340439,3,B0013FSL16,"I had been waiting for the fifth season to come out on DVD for a while, but I had also forgotten that the writer's strike cut many shows short that season.  Nip/Tuck was one of those.  I was looking forward to seeing how the show picked up since season 4 ended with basically everything in the show changing (the divorce, Julia moving to NY, Sean moving to LA, selling the business, Matt and Kimber having a baby, etc.).  Within the first three episodes of this season I was hooked.  The first episode connected the frayed ends of the last episode of Season 4 with enough clarity to make it entertaining and believable.  However after that it becomes quickly apparent that the strike had an adverse affect on the continuity of the show.  Only the episodes that were completed were shot, leaving gaps in the action between episodes.  One episode would end with a character hanging in the balance, then the next 2 episodes would mention nothing of that character, and then finally that character would miraculously re-appear.  With the continuity broken it leaves you wondering time and again when they'll get back to the plot line involving said character.  And there are so many different plot lines going on that 14 episodes is obviously not enough to cover it all (8 more were scheduled for shooting for a total of 22).  The sheer number of happenings keeps you hooked, but the lack of depth in many of them leaves you disappointed when they get resolved.  So much happens in this season that I doubt even 22 episodes could have clearly resolved them (or even set them up for the Sixth Season without creating gaps).  In all this is a definite must watch for any fan of the series, but don't be expecting the Greatness that was Seasons 1 & 2 and to a lesser extent 3 & 4.  Season 5 was just another victim of the writer's strike and hopefully many of the issues left open by the strike can be corrected in the following season.",1232668800,,1929,4.540462427745664
3340440,4,B0013FSL16,"WOW, I can't believe Season 5 received so many bad reviews. Our favorite bad guy, Christian Troy, as well as his sexually deviant side kick Kimber, is up to their old tricks. The Julia McNamara character is as socially helpless as ever and Sean is struggling with being the consummate doormat. The Matt character got a chance to spread his acting wings (although I'm glad he didn't go thru with the gay sex scene). I hate to see the Gina character released because I loved her sexually needy character. The Eden character was a nice addition to the storyline and John Schneider, turns in some convincing performances as porn king Ram Peters. For all those sour puss reviewers, the underlying theme of the show has always been superficiality (or the fulfillment of needs thru superficial means) that's why the show started off in Miami, and moved to Los Angeles. The show is about need, loneliness, inferiority issues, sexual abuse and damaged souls; shouldn't we expect a little craziness? Of course we should! I haven't watched the special features portion of the set yet, but I was dying to finish the season first. I think this season is a keeper.",1232064000,,1150,4.78391959798995
3340441,5,B0013FSL16,"ADULT DRAMA, ADULT HUMOR & ALWAYS INTELLIGENT, INNOVATIVE & CUTTING EDGE

People, people.  I get ticked when I see poor reviews of intelligent, innovative and creative programming.  It's a daring show that should be applauded again and again.  The casting, acting, storylines are always multi-level and as deep as you can go.  I wish folks that don't like adult programs would go back to watching the network sitcoms and stuff that entertains them.  Let the adults who ""get"" Nip/Tuck on its many levels enjoy it year after year.  The cast & writing is supurb. Even if there is a dip on a show or two.  Their worst is still light years ahead of other programming.

Why would anyone in their right mind pay this astronomical amount (the same I paid for the entire season sets I got when they were released), only to have to pony up more money when the remaining episodes are released.  While I love Nip/Tuck, I will not spend my hard earned money on a set that is not a complete season release.  I refused to do so when 30 Rock did this, and I will not do so now.  I say wait until the complete season is released and consider making the purchase at that time.",1228608000,35,622,4.073770491803279

Seems to me they could wait a few month to put them all together rather than having a part 1 and 2 for season 5 as so many other tv series have done recently... sopranos, entourage, etc.

Disappointing that we are only going to get 8 episodes in Jan 09 then have to wait till Jan 2010 for next season, and Jan 2011 for final season...",1226966400,5,474,3.9270833333333335
3340444,4,B0013FSL16,"The fifth season of Nip/Tuck finds Sean (Dylan Walsh) and Christian (Julian McMahon) setting up their practice in the most synthetic town on the planet: Hollywood.  It takes a while for things to take off, which they do when Sean and Christian end up stumbling into playing parts on a TV medical drama, and contending with its egotistic star (Midnight Meat Train's Bradley Cooper) while Sean romances its female lead (Paula Marshall).  There's some inventive twists that are abound, including the downward spiral that Matt (John Hensley) and Kimber (Kelly Carlson) are on, and Julia's (Joely Richardson) surprising new realationship.  There's pivotal guest star roles from Portia de Rossi, John Schneider, and sexy AnnaLynne McCord, and Nip/Tuck still manages to be entertaining five seasons in, even though this season just simply isn't as good as previous seasons of the series.  Still, there's a cliffhanger ending that will have you salivating for more to come, and here's hoping that Nip/Tuck will continue to deliver the goods.",1223683200,9,1033,5.242424242424242

3340446,5,B0013FSL16,this show continues to be the most entertaining show on tv (including the major networks.  the ensemble acting is superior (especially julian mcmahon).,1211587200,3,151,5.565217391304348
3340447,5,B0013FSL16,"First, let me say that in all honesty, I honestly thought that this season of ""Nip/Tuck"" was going to fail, simply because Seasons 3 & 4 were huge disappointments. I was shocked at the new level that the writers/producers of this show has taken it to and I enjoyed every bit of it.

The doctors and their families, friends and colleagues all move to California, where they not only continue their practices, but they discover a large multiple of ups and downs. I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't seen this season, but I'll just add that this season covers a ""new"" sexual phenomenon in white suburbia (which is called ""Cuckoldry""), reality TV, female stalkers, Julia exploring her sexuality, characters Matt & Julia hitting rock bottom, Kimber going back into her old ways by becoming a porn starlet and an 18-year-old temptress named ""Eden"" causing friction in Sean and Julia's life. In this season, things go downhill for just about everyone and just when you think things are going well for the characters in this story, things get uglier and uglier! In this season, there are special guest appearances by porn-star Lexington Steele, Boris Kodjoe, ""New York"" (from the ""Flavor of Love"" show), Tia Carrere, Rosie O'Donnell, etc...

While Season Two was my most personal favorite season for ""Nip/Tuck"", this season is equivalent to that particular season, because Season Five was so damn entertaining, just like Season Two and I loved it! I just hope that Season Six (the final season, maybe?) will be as great as this one.",1211587200,13,1534,4.851145038167939
3340448,4,B0013FSL16,"what A LOT of people don't seem to realize is that there were supposed to be 22 episodes this season, making it the longest nip/tuck season yet. however, only 14 were aired. (most likely due to the wrighters strike we're all so familiar with) so for those that feel there was no closure, you're right, there wasn't any, because that was never supposed to be the close, they just aired the ones they had finished.

while i agree, the plots have gotten more and more shocking, and less about the surgery and the subtlties of the charecter relationships, i have to keep my fingers crossed that by the end of the season (the missing episodes rumored to be airing early this fall, possibly late summer) things will turn around a bit and get more involved, and less trashy.

never the less, i'm gonna buy it, i plan to support my favorite show, leave my input, and hope it gets back to some taste.

love the show, love ya all, feel free to contact me

3340449,2,B0013FSL16,"I really like this show and the characters, but this season was a disappointment.  I'm glad I saw it on TV, so that I did not spend money on the DVD.  On the good side: (1) some attempts at satire of the series  (2) many guest stars (3) interesting cliffhanger;  The bad: (1) some plots that were so ridiculous that I laughed out loud (one character's death in the middle of the season was so ridiculous that I thought it was a dream at first!) (2) fewer and less interesting surgeries than the other seasons  (3) many unresolved plot lines and far less overall coherance than the other seasons (4) the villain did not get their just desserts (yet) - usually the series concludes with some kind of closure, but there was no closure of any of the plot lines! (5) the other seasons were provocative, but this season was just trashy (e.g., ""gasp, it's a swinger's party"" - but we already saw something similar in Season 1) (6) far less use of characters such as Julia and Liz.  During this season it really felt like they were running out of ideas (I wonder if it will be possible for Matt to be in a more screwed up relationship!)  Hopefully they will wrap the series up in the next couple of seasons and end on a good note.",1210636800,10,1222,4.333333333333333
