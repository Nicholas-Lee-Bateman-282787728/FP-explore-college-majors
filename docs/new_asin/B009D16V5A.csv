8539825,4,B009D16V5A,"Nicely put together,most of the footage is already out in other forms. To be honest its a bootleg! sadly for die hard fans this is the only way one can obtain this stuff. Apple corps has thousands of hours in the vaults from all the world tours 1964/65/66. But it costs a lot of money to remaster it,also the remaining Beatles and their estates probably get a better royalty rate on their solocd&dvds. The performances on the dvd are Wembley Poll Winners concert1965,and Paris concert 1965 footage from both shows. For just under six dollars its  great value.",1376265600,2,559,4.704081632653061
