8432713,5,B004KCG058,I watched this program last year.  I really liked the host because he really wanted my students to understand the SQ3R system.  I though this program was to the point and easy to understand. This program is a good buy!,1318809600,,218,4.425
8432714,1,B004KCG058,This DVD was a dissapointment. I was expecting so much more!!! It is merely a PowerPoint with a person reading the slides. The information is extremely basic - what you could find anywhere on the Internet or as a brief mention in a professional book or article. There are NO examples of each step of the SQ3R process. A brief explanation of each step is what you are paying for. It is of absolutely no use to me as a literacy coach. I cannot recommend it to the teachers with whom I work.,1314921600,,488,4.258064516129032
