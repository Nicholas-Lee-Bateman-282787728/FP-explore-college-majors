8005310,5,B00011ZBPM,"Yes, it's the continuing adventures of Tuliphead, I mean Himeno Awayuki, she who likes powdered green tea/kimchee ice cream, who has chosen to become the Pretear, the Princess of Light, to combat the Princess of Despair, Fenrir, in her attempts to suck out the Earth's life essence, or Leafe.  Fortunately, she has seven Leafe Knights to help her-Hayate, Sasame, Go, Kei, Mannen, Hajime, and Shin.  This contains episodes 4 through 7.

Himeno's still an amateur Pretear, but she's improving, both in fighting and detecting Fenrir's demon larvae.  However, they have become cleverer in concealing themselves, which cause consternation for the rest of the Leafe Knights.  Yet Himeno seems distracted and at odds with herself, especially after having a nightmare where she is attacked by a host of purple butterflies, Fenrir's familiars who give her Leafe, and is warned by Fenrir herself.

But the Knights are supportive of her.  Hayate stands guard over her since her nightmare, and the child knights, ever fond of her, want to take turns guarding her.  Kei and Go give her encouragement.  It's Mikage the friendly maid, who has the answer for Himeno, and that is to figure things out in a methodical manner.  Himeno doesn't know anything about the Princess of Despair, so she goes that route, aided by the three children Knights, Mannen, Hajime, and Shin.  That means a trip to Leafenia and where Fenrir was originally imprisoned.

The overarching theme in this disc is thus her wanting to be on the same page as her comrades and to know more about the Princess of Despair and basically how this whole thing started.  The Knights, particularly Hayate and Sasame, are reluctant to divulge this info.  So she is shocked to learn from Kei that Fenrir used to be her predecessor Takako, in other words, a human being and Pretear!

The story of Takako giving in her to evil side, of changing the direction of her power, mirrors how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader.  In Takako's case, it was not only inner self-conflict and the fear within her, but despair derived from unrequited love.  Basically, this conflict began because Hayate was unable to reciprocate her feelings towards him, and that was the final straw.  Also, the difference between a Pretear and the Princess of Despair is akin to that of a Jedi and a Sith.  Kei says that one takes (negative) and the other gives (positive).

Despite Himeno trying to do her best, Sasame wonders if she really is tough.  ""A wound in the heart doesn't heal easily.  The open wound never closes, nor does the pain go away.""  In other words, Himeno has the potential of becoming another Princess of Despair should she get carried away with her self-conflict and doubt.  That's more apt for Mawata, Himeno's withdrawn and introverted stepsister, where not much happens to her in these episodes, but foretells what happens to her later.  However, when Mawata witnesses the fun Himeno has after smashing her father's tuliphead sculpture, she finds the obviously happy relationship Himeno has with her father wonderful.

Pretear also borrows a page from Norse mythology-Fenris the wolf.  Exchanging the ""s"" to an ""r"" gives us Fenrir.  And the sight of Fenrir atop a monstrous demon larva that resembles a mushroom with columns hanging down from the cap, might be a nod to Alice in Wonderland and the Mad Hatter, though I didn't see Fenrir smoking a hookah.

There are bits of comedy in here, the funniest which involves one of Mayune's backfired practical jokes.  Knowing of her stepsisters' morning habit of practicing karate on stacks of roofing tiles, she includes a tile with reinforced steel inside.  The tile falls on Himeno's head.  The girl just keeps walking as if nothing has happened.  When she comes to breakfast, she greets her parents with a bow, where the tile falls off her head, causing the breakfast table to collapse.  Just how hard is Himeno's head anyway?

The seventh episode ends on a crisis note, something that sets back the Leafe Knights and Himeno.  The story develops further, the Knights are fun and supportive, especially Sasame and Go, Thus ends the further adventures of Tulip... I mean Himeno.",1121385600,,4166,4.926829268292683
8005311,5,B00011ZBPM,"Pretear - the magical girl anime where you've seen every elment of it before, but not like this.

Himeno is slowly setting into her role as Pretear, a woman whose natural mystic powers enhance those of the Leafe Knights, the defenders of earth's life energy.  But being a magical girl and world savior means changes to her life, and having to do a lot of explanation.  Meanwhile, she starts to understand the complicated lives of those around her . . .

Warning: This series pretty much is a rewrite of the manga.  Though they have the same characters and ideas (mostly), this series interprets much of it differently.  That being said, both are qutie good.",1115510400,,657,4.6695652173913045
8005312,5,B00011ZBPM,The second disc of pretear is so much better than the first. In this disc you finally get to meat fenril the princess of disaster. She is so cool. You also find out more secrets about how she became the princess of disaster and you learn mor about the leafe knights past. She merges with Kei and  Manen in this disk and you get to see the best dress the one she has with Kei. The only bad thing about this disk is itleave with a cliffhanger. The animation in this disk is still great and the dubbing is good too. This is a must own for any pretear fan or just about any anime fan.,1084838400,3,580,4.0

8005314,5,B00011ZBPM,"Pretear is probably my favorite anime of all time. It's about seven leafe knights in search of the one girl who has the power and ability to become Pretear-one who transforms into a magical girl with different powers such as water, fire, ice, when her hand touches with that of the knights. The pretear is to release leafe infinitely in order to save the world. This is the basic story plot, but Im leaving out the twists, because I would hate to spoil things for those who haven't seen it yet.
My personal opinion toward Pretear, it is romantic funny, and magical. It may sound like a typical magical girl anime, yet it is different.  Behind the humor and romance hides a darkly secret which will be revealed later in the series leaving me with teary eyes. Even though Pretear is only made into 13 episode, the anime completes itself perfectly. The graphical art is beautiful, including the battle and her transformation. After watching the anime, it leaves me the urge of watching it over and over again. It is definitely an anime fan would want to buy if u're into shoujo. If you have seen Fushigi yugi or fruits basket, I can gareantee you that Pretear tops both of them, wheather on its art or its storyline/romance. In addition, the music has a really nice beat, beautiful yet refreshing. Trust me, you won't regret it.",1074297600,5,1325,4.614406779661017
8005315,5,B00011ZBPM,"For those of you who enjoyed the first volume, this one is even better!  We left our story from volume one on a very light, silly note.  Nothing of that in volume two.  Certainly, there is humor and comic relief, but from the very start, it is evident that THIS IS DARKER.
There are only three episodes in this one, but they are well worth it, each episode goes deeper into the story.  In this volume, you are FINALLY introduced to the real ""bad guy,"" Fenrir the Princess of Disaster.  For those of you who have NOT ever seen it, I won't give away anything where Fenrir is concerned, but she is a VERY interesting character.
You also begin to get a little more of the romance developing between Himeno and Hayate...which of course is ALWAYS worth watching.  ;-)
Be forewarned...unlike the first volume, which ended quite well, this one ends with the nastiest of cliffhangers!  It's just plain mean!  Just be prepared to be sitting on the edge of your seat waiting for volume three to hit the stands!!!
Excellent all the way through, I've only had it for about a week, and already I've watched it three or four times!  It is highly entertaining, the story is tight, and it's very, very watchable.",1074211200,5,1195,4.52093023255814
