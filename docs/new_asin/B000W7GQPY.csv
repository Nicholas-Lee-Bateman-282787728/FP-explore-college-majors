8221512,3,B000W7GQPY,I am a yoga instructor and I'm always looking for new ideas to offer straps and blocks.  This video talked like it would offer modifications for advanced poses.  It doesn't.  This would be a great video for someone new starting yoga with limitations.  It's slow paced and very simplistic.,1208995200,7,288,4.816326530612245
8221513,1,B000W7GQPY,"Learn how to effortlessly master the most difficult Yoga positions! That's what the dvd info says.  Yet, there is not one difficult pose on the tape.  It doesn't look like this fellow has been doing yoga very long; he even has the plastic wrap still on his blocks. This dvd was expensive and this guy should feel some shame in mis-marketing this, just to get the bucks.  I know he has other dvd's but I certainly wouldn't buy them after viewing this joke.",1207785600,3,455,4.457831325301205
