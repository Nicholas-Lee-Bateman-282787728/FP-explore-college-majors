7907243,5,B00000F8IH,"Of all of unique human stories ever told, this one is a shining diamond!
The cast does superbly in their efforts for this movie and I believe that this is Patricia Arquette's best delivered role yet.
Beau Bridges as well, shines along with Reese Witherspoon in this story.
Though, in my review it is hard to top the previous descriptions of other viewers who have liked this movie, only to say that for me, this movie is highly personable. I too, am a girl who lived in my early years in a world of silence to be awoken into the world of hearing by the technology of the hearing aid. I had to in fact wear the very one that Patricia did and my reactions to sounds was very much like hers, a day of glory in investigating the world around me.
This marvelous story and performances of the actors, inspired me, touched me, challenged me, and gave me the encouragement to not give in to the frustrations of my deafness, but to embrace the love of family and friends around me, and to look to best in people into the power of love in humankind that no matter what difficulties come before us, we can choose to be compassionate, loving, and forgiving of those that do not understand differences that exist in people. Differences can be in circumstances, appearance, religion, but I believe this movie teaches us to achieve the best in human spirits within ourselves.",1025740800,,1360,4.510121457489879
7907244,5,B00000F8IH,"This is a story I could watch time after time.  It's a very old fashioned story of human fraility and finding the courage to be your highest self.
Beau Bridges plays the FATHER of Ellie and Sammy (not Sammy as another reviewer wrote).  He is wonderful as the hard-acting but soft-hearted father doing his best to cope with raising Ellie and Sammy alone since the death of his wife.
Susan Blakely is really good as Alice's impoverished and virtually imprisoned mother.
Reese Witherspoon, as Ellie, is young and showing early signs of why we now see her in so many movies.  She does a great job of playing a southern, pre-teen, country girl who finds mischief at every turn.
Sammy .... who IS Sammy?  I don't know the actor, but he looks exactly like Montgomery Cliff.
It's a great movie that will surely lift your heart high.",1011052800,2,824,4.585034013605442
7907245,5,B00000F8IH,"I really liked this video with Patricia Arquette.  The title was a perfect one for the movie because it really captured the essence of Patricia's character, Alice.  She did a beautiful job with how she portrayed Alice--both in her speech and her expressions of the very innocence that characterized Alice.  I  thought it was a heartfelt movie with a good ending.  It's a movie you could see over and over!",1001808000,,405,4.728571428571429
7907246,5,B00000F8IH,"This movie should be released again because it deals with issues we often don't see in movies today. Alice Guthrie (Patricia Arquette) is hearing impaired and has epilepsy. She is not understood by her family and they have locked her up and are frustrated with the situation. Her step-father is cruel and seems a bit insane. He has no love in his heart and refuses to seek help for his step-daughter. Her mother is weak willed and goes along with the father, locking her own daughter up and allowing him to mistreat her.

Ellie Perkins and her teenage brother Sammy (Beau Bridges) live next door and while riding her horse, Ellie hears screams coming from the Guthrie's farm. Horrified, she goes to investigate and later tells only her brother what she has seen. Together they secretly go visit Alice and try to teach her about life outside the farm. Soon they realize Alice has a hearing problem and when she has an epileptic fit, they immediately find a doctor. Ellie gives up a cherished heirloom in order to help pay the doctor for his help and it showed true kindness and love.

This movie will make you realize that we are all the same, just humans trying to survive on the planet and that by showing kindness to one another, we can make the earth a better place for us all. If you love roses, you will also enjoy this movie. There is a gorgeous wild rose bush and red roses are sprinkled through the movie in a very romantic way. Beau Bridges and Patricia Arquette have wonderful screen chemistry and their love is innocent and sweet, like the scent of a rose.

7907250,2,B00000F8IH,I thought this movie was one of the best I've seen in a long time.  It was well written and beautifully acted.
