1144047,4,7885881695,"20th Century Fox presents ""THE PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND"" (1936) - (96 min/B&W) -- Starring: Warner Baxter, Gloria Stuart, Claude Gillingwater, Arthur Byron, John Carradine & Harry Carey

Directed by John Ford

In 1865 Dr. Samuel Mudd (Warner Baxter), a known Confederate sympathizer, sets the broken leg of a mud-caked stranger who stumbles into his home. The injured man turns out to be John Wilkes Booth (Francis McDonald), and Mudd is accused of conspiring to murder President Lincoln. Sentenced to hang with the genuine conspirators, Mudd finds his sentence commuted to life imprisonment at the very last moment. He is shipped to Shark Island, a brutal penal colony. Subject to the cruelties of a guard Sgt. Rankin (John Carradine) who hates Mudd because of his ""complicity"" in Lincoln's death, the doctor suffers the torments of the damned, while back home his wife, Peggy (Gloria Stuart) campaigns desperately to get her husband pardoned. During a Yellow Fever breakout on Shark Island, Dr. Mudd performs heroically to save the survivors. For his humanitarian efforts, Mudd is finally released and reunited with his wife.

An almost unbelievable but true story ... well told by the maestro John Ford

Dr. Samuel Mudd's story was retold in the Hellgate (1952), with Sterling Hayden as the (fictional) doctor.  Also worth a view.

1144048,3,7885881695,"Seen as a drama, this is a satisfying film by the great John Ford, set in the aftermath of President Lincoln's assassination.  John Wilkes Booth, on the lam after fleeing Ford's Theater, visited Maryland country doctor Samuel Mudd, who set Booth's broken leg.  Caught up in the manhunt for the other conspirators, Dr. Mudd was sentenced to life in prison by a military court, and he was sent to Fort Jefferson in Florida's Dry Tortugas to serve his time.  In the 1936 film, there's good acting by Warner Baxter as Dr. Mudd, and John Carradine gives an over-the-top performance as a cruel jailer.

Nunnally Johnson's screenplay addressed some themes -- lynching, public pressure and emotion, command influence on a court, and so on -- always worth contemplating.  Given the recent controversy over military tribunals for terrorists, the film provides some food for thought.

How accurate, however, was the screenplay?  Did the military court railroad Mudd?  The screenplay omits evidence that Dr. Mudd had met Booth some months earlier, and that he may have been aware of the conspiracy.  The film portrayed him as completely innocent.  Dr. Mudd's case has prompted a great deal of historical research and a recent review by the Board for the Correction of Military Records.  His sentence, however, has never been overturned.

The film, then, provides an interesting case study of ""Hollywood"" vs. ""history,"" and this could be an excellent subject for a high school or college history paper, asking questions like these:  Did Mudd know the conspirators?  Should he have been tried in a civilian court?  How fair was the military trial?  How did ""The Prisoner of Shark Island"" continue the ""lost cause"" narrative of the Civil War, and the parallel denial of rights for African Americans?

Finally, a parental advisory:  To this viewer the treatment of African American characters, mostly troops assigned as guards at the military prison, shows the attitudes and stereotypes of the 1930s.  The film, then, is not only about 1865.  It's about 1936 too.

1144049,4,7885881695,"The film begins with the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth jumping on to the stage and making his escape out the back of the theater. In jumping from the balcony, Booth breaks his leg and soon needs medical attention. In the movie he asks for directions to a local doctor and appears unannounced at the home of Dr. Samuel Mudd, who, of course (without the Internet & cable TV) has not yet heard of the assassination. He treats Booth and keeps him overnight until he can travel again. The authorities trace Booth's escape to Mudd's estate and arrest him for being an accomplice. He is tried in what appears to be somewhat of a kangaroo court and sent to Shark Island Prison in the Florida Keys. He tried to escape once, unsuccessfully. A violent outbreak of Yellow Fever in which he heroically saves the lives of many of the prisoners while risking his own, convinces his accusers to rethink his guilt. The question is whether Dr. Mudd was an innocent bystander as the movie depicts or was he, in fact, part of the Booth conspiracy. This movie is well done and entertaining and is a terrific introduction to the whole story of John Wilkes Booth and the conspiracy theories. Like the JFK assassination debate, was this a lone gunman or a conspiracy much larger? A fascinating subject. [...]",1220745600,10,1319,4.689655172413793
1144050,4,7885881695,"Excellent early John Ford movie and it was good to see John Carradine pop up-he was usually one of Ford's players in his stock company anyhow.
But Mudds tale as this movie tells it??
So syrupy and sentimental that you may have to brush your teeth afterwards.
IMO, Mudd was guilty.
He knew it was JWB.
Don't forget, Mudd just missed doing the 'rope dance' by a 5-4 decision.
Read Steer's 'His Name Is Still Mudd' if you still have doubts.
But by all means watch this movie!!!
One of Ford's seldom seen but enjoyable works!!",1208476800,2,522,4.447916666666667
1144051,5,7885881695,"""The Prisoner of Shark Island"" is the story of one Samuel Mudd, a Maryland physician. The good doctor is ably played by Warner Baxter. After assassinating President Lincoln, John Wilkes Booth hurt his leg jumping from a balcony. Eluding the Law, JWB called on Mudd, who set the leg without knowing Booth's true identity. The pursuing Fed troops treat Mudd as a conspirator and he is sentenced to life in a military stockade. The ""trial"" is an unvarnished martial law kangaroo court. The ""Shark Island"" here is actually Dry Tortugas Island, off the coast of Key West, FL. PSI deals with the efforts of Mudd and his wife to win exoneration. There is excellent work here, especially by Gloria Staurt as a fiercely loyal wife standing by her man, and Harry Carey Sr. as the prison commandant. In PSI, all the prison guards are African American. They receive interesting treatment, given the historical setting of both the Civil War and climate of mid 1930s, when PSI was made. A good review doesn't reveal endings but the one here is thoroughly satisfying. One may wish to have a tissue handy. Even in the 1930s, John Ford could be sentimental! This reviewer benefited from a brand new CD, clear and sharp.  PSI is one of those oldies which are not over shown/overexposed. Amazoners are urged to make an effort to view it. Highly recommended!",1200441600,19,1338,4.767241379310345
1144052,3,7885881695,"A film dealing in part with a subject seldom touched upon in Hollywood; in this case, the military tribunals which passed judgment upon those who played even insignificant roles in one of history's greatest tragedies- and always the verdict was the same. Guilty, regardless of the facts.
It may be worth pointing out that this is a movie from the 1930s, and it's stereotypical portrayal of African-Americans was no doubt intended to win the favor of theater goers of that era. Keep this in the back of your mind as you view this.
All in all, a good movie. Not a great one, but a good one.",1196294400,2,588,4.5046728971962615
1144053,5,7885881695,"This is less a review and more a comment that I await the release of the DVD on this long-forgotten John Ford film about Dr. Mudd. Let me announce my bias and interest. I am author of the book ""The Union vs. Dr. Mudd,"" originally published in 1964, due to be reprinted by the University Press of Florida in the spring of 2008, well in time for celebrations in 2009 related to the 200th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's birthday. It is fitting and proper that the film has been scheduled for release in a DVD format in advance of the reprint edition of my book. Was Dr. Mudd guilty or innocent in the conspiracy connected with the Lincoln assassination? Historians differ on this fact. You can make up your own mind after seeing the film and later reading the book. I'll place my order with Amazon.com in time for the December 4 release.",1193097600,3,836,4.470588235294118
1144054,4,7885881695,"When John Wlikes Booth assassinated President Lincoln he jumped to the stage from Lincoln's private box and broke his leg. This movie is about Doctor Mudd who treated Booth's leg when he was on the run from authorities. Mudd was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to prison on an island fortress in the Florida Keys. This is the story of his life. Mudd maintained his innocence throughout the ordeal but the truth is only known to Mudd himself. Good story, well acted but somewhat depressing. Worth a look.",1191628800,10,506,4.827586206896552

1144219,4,7885881695,"The Prisoner of Shark Island(released Feb/36)stars,among others, Warner Baxter,Gloria Stuart,Frank McGlynn and Francis McDonald. This is a solid story under Ford's tutelage, and while not one of his greatest,it certainly ranks among his best.
The story finds us at the end of the Civil War. A crowd turns out on the White House lawn(those were the days!) to hear the president speak. He makes no speech but instead asks the accompanying band to play""Dixie"".Next we see Lincoln at the Ford theatre watching a play and his resultant assassination that night. Booth shot him,landed on the stage(breaking his one leg)and hobbled away. That night before crossing into Virginia he and an accomplice stop at a doctors office,Dr. S.Mudd,and asks the good doctor to help him. After a quick patch job the two are back on their way.
The next day the army comes by and arrests the good doctor for aiding and abetting the presidents assassin. There is a court martial(no public criminal trial) and about half the conspirators are hung,while the others are sent to Dry Tortuga/Fort Jefferson at the end of the Florida Keys. That was the U.S.'s answer to France's Devil's Island.
Life is harsh in the Fort,made no more bearable by it's sadistic captain. Mudd ends up meeting one of his old slaves who enlisted and came there to work at the Fort, just to see him. Eventually Mudd and he conspire the break out after he gets a letter from his wife telling him there will be a boat in the harbour waiting for him. The break out is attempted but the former slave and the doctor get caught. Both are put in solitary to rot.
Nature has a way sometimes of evening things out despite man's efforts otherwise. In this case the entire Fort is hit with a terrible spread of Yellow Fever. Men die and even the prison doctor comes down with it. Mudd is asked to help and he does. After the worst has passed the doctor is put in for a pardon by the warden. Eventually the good doctor is pardoned and is sent back home,as is his former slave. Both have a reunion with their families together.
The story seems straight out of the history books on first galnce. Ford was a master at making us forget the real stories behind what we were watching. Ford adds many realistic touches such as the guards marches through the Fort(shuffling of feet),the black guards of the Fort etc. But one that really hit me was the hanging of the conspirators. We don't actually see it happen,but we see the reaction of the people,the looks in their faces. Even grown men,tough individuals, would either look away or balk at what they saw. Hanging is not the spectator sport many think.
The real story of Mudd is not so,pardon the expression,black and white as portrayed here. Some of the basics in the film are real,but the majority is pure fiction. But this is Hollywood after all. Even the title Sharks island""...what's with that? There is no such thing. It must have come from the imagination of the studio advert department,who felt it more compelling. And I suppose,if I'm honest, they might have been right there.
I also might mention I am not a Civil War fan per se'.I can take them or leave them,because generally speaking it's not my favourite genre of film. However I found this one works on other levels besides the basic Civil War/post Civil War back drop. Ultimately it is about the human condition,human frailties and our behaviour in the darkest of times;both good and bad. Something everyone can relate to.
Technically speaking the film is in its original a/r,is B&W, and is an excellent print. Extras include commentary,restoration comparison,a photo gallery,etc.
All in all a solid entry in the Ford canon. Watch for a very young Carradine in his sadistic role as the army guard captain. Baxter,the star,acquits himself well in this one,and he is ably backed by all. Four stars all the way.",1422489600,,3857,4.724035608308605
1144220,4,7885881695,"First off, this drama is a Hollywood movie- not a history lesson.  You have to enjoy it for its performance value.  And it was an entertaining version of what happed to Dr. Mudd after the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln.  He was tried and convicted by a military tribunal and only missed being hanged by a 5-4 vote.  Instead he is sent to Shark Island, called so because it was surrounded by a moat 70 foot wide and 35 foot deep filled with hungry sharks.  He is to end his days there.  After a failed escape attempt he is thown into the hole.  Then the prison is struck by malaria at a time when they did not know how to treat it or even what caused it.  This is a well done melodrama and good entertainment.  Worth a watch.  Dr, Mudd is played by Warner Baxter who had won the Oscar for Best Actor playing the Cisco Kid in ""In Old Arizona"" in 1930.",1419638400,,861,4.195121951219512
1144221,5,7885881695,"This is the story of Dr. Mudd and the miscarriage of justice he suffered by merely treating the man who slew President Lincoln. The hysteria the surrounded the Lincoln Assassination was astounding. Once convictions were issued no one was willing to admit a mistake. It cost a woman her life and Dr. Mudd years in prison. Another great performance by Warner Baxter. With all films there will always be some errors,  but it was truly great that 70 years after someone was willing to try and tell the truth.",1399680000,,504,4.662921348314606
1144222,4,7885881695,"A little bit of history that goes with shot most people only know about the assignation of President Lincoln. The story tells of the mood of the nation wanting to arrest and persecute anyone they can in that might have had any part what so ever in the assignation, guilty or innocent. It leaves you suspect that Dr. Mudd was arrested and sent to prison unjustly. The real truth is that he in fact may have had a part in the plot as he met with Booth on several occasions prior to the shooting. Booth had been to his home and they met at a bar in town, so the real truth may never be known as to whether he was in fact guilty or innocent.",1382572800,,637,4.063492063492063
1144223,2,7885881695,"I'm fond of many of John Ford's mid 30s themes but this is a murky and flawed fairy tale about the infamous Dr. Samuel Mudd, arrested for aiding and abetting 2 of the Lincoln assassins.  Virtually none of it grounded in historical fact.  The casting of its protagonist Warner Baxter is a weak choice to carry the lead, he is exceedingly dull and unsympathetic.  It feels like director John Ford is treading water here, though he may be credited for at least exploring the obscure subject.  Its fatal flaw is probably Baxter since there are some taught and brilliantly composed shots of the prison escape. And John Carradine does not disappoint as a villainous and sadistic jailer.  Too bad for the overall result, Baxter is a dud as Mudd.

I've collected most of Ford's talkies and this one is definitely a lesser effort.  The better choices for mid-30s Ford are two very poignant efforts with Will Rogers; Dr. Bull and Judge Priest, and the 2 tragic gems; The Lost Patrol, and The Informer.  And save your money for an even more obscure but essential early John Ford film; Pilgrimage.  Though dated for some of its stylizations but brilliant for its lead; little known Henrietta Crossman is cold-hearted but ultimately redeemable Hannah Jessop. Much deeper, richer, more complex than Prisoner Of Shark Island.",1356566400,,1310,4.864864864864865

7900609,4,7885881695,"Prisoner of Shark Island is an early John Ford film giving an only roughly accurate version of the story of Dr. Samuel Mudd, who treated John Wilkes Booth for the injuries he sustained in assassinating Lincoln, was arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment as part of the assassination conspiracy, and was later exonerated. The film is well done and tautly directed, though it also occasionally displays Ford's typical weaknesses of sentimentality, stereotyping, and low humor.  Warner Baxter (probably best remembered today for 42nd Street) does a creditable job as Mudd, and John Carradine is a standout as a sadistic prison guard.  Though generally minor Ford, the piece does have a few good set pieces, such as the portrait of Lincoln ordering the band to play ""Dixie"" as a token of reconciliation, and the grim scenes of the trial and execution of the conspirators. All in all, generally worth watching still today, and certainly a film that serious students of Ford's work will want to see.  The Ford at Fox DVD is of good quality.  Advisory: the film's treatment of African-Americans, while clearly well intentioned, is likely to strike today's viewers as stereotyped and patronizing.",1494806400,,1193,5.134020618556701

I loved the geometric compositions and the deep shadows and lighting. One shot stands out for me when Dr. Mudd, upon learning his sentence, drops the chains holding his shackles and hangs his head in despair. The light around him slowly dims until he's back-lit by the window.

Buck (Ernest Whitman), a former slave, is impressive for his loyalty and friendship. He's stands out as one of the bright spots in this otherwise dark film. Playing a satanic sergeant is John Carradine, who does a great job.",1490486400,,629,4.814814814814815

Racist themes crop up frequently (although Ford was NOT a racist) but those attitudes were in keeping with the era being dramatized. If you are looking for strict historic accuracy watch a documentary on this subject matter or read about it. This is a MOVIE and a darn good one, at that. The entire cast is superb!
