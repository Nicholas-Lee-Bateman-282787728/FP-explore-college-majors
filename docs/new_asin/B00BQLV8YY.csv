This every-man scenario, as laid out by Craig, starts laying the scene out of you being at work, your spouse being at work and your kids being at school when disaster strikes.  This is EXACTLY the scenario Oklahomans run through our minds every spring during storm / tornado season.  Living out on the farm and growing up in remote rural Missouri, we were intimately aware of what it was like to be cut off from civilization during a major snowstorm or during bad weather, so we were prepared with canned goods, fresh water drawn up, etc.

But it chills me to think of trying to bunker / shelter in place in an urban environment.  We simply don't have the lifestyle that all good working class people had just a couple of decades ago.  Well, this DVD in its simplicity was a wake-up call.

Don't get me wrong, Craig Caudill is very good at presenting what he knows, and he knows volumes, but this one video is just an overview of some basics to make it a few days until services are restored.  This is just a summary to lay out scenarios and avoid the ""stupid mistakes"" that most folks will make, no matter how smart they are in other areas of their lives.

For the purchase price, it's definitely worth the watch.  It just might save you and your loved ones.

Remember, that you don't go to war with the army you wish you had; you go to war with the army that you do have.  The same applies to survival because you never know where or when disaster(s) might happen, and by then, it's too late for properly prepare.",1408838400,2,1670,4.421568627450981
