2934805,5,B000VARC4G,"This movie is based on a very amazing true story about a Colombian Army unit who finds a rebel cache of millions of USD. Instead of turning it in, they take the money and tell no one. Unfortunately, the find is not a secret for long. The title means ""Dreams Cost Nothing"" (literally). I met the General of the Colombian Army who was in office at the time of this incident. He said the basis of the movie is true, but he could not say whether or not the personal story of one of the movies characters was real. This movie contains a very poignant moral statement. The movie is in Spanish, but has subtitles.",1231804800,38,606,4.278260869565218

8217855,2,B000VARC4G,"What could be called a Colombian attempt at Kelly's Heroes fails to engage, either as military drama or dark comedy.  Derivative, with characters that walk through the film as caricatures, a premise that could have been rich with adventure and humor, even serious themes, falls far short of its potential.  A yawn...",1338940800,,316,5.0576923076923075
