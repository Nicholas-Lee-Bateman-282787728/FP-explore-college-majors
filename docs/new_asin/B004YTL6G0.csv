4503152,4,B004YTL6G0,"Great tape, makes working out at home quick and challenging.  There are 3 separate workouts and most days I do two, which is only 20 minutes in duration, but gets my heartrate up and makes me break out in a sweat!",1323129600,6,213,4.195121951219512
4503153,5,B004YTL6G0,I love Tony Horton- he is a crazy man who works you hard! This DVD works well as a supplement to other 10 minute trainer programs.  I find myself sweating and breathing hard... and i work out every day!,1322438400,6,202,4.17948717948718
4503154,5,B004YTL6G0,Best workout and fastest out there -- you will loose weight by eating correctly - which everyone should anyways...and the workout is direct and effective. If your a busy professional with kids - this is for you...if you are in college and want to stay tone and trim - this is for you....I've done Power 90 - and I like this workout much better...I'm fit and in shape - and beyond eating a good slice of pie with a hot cup of dark coffee every now and again...this is a main stay...actually - they should incorporate each of these work outs in public schools - 10 minutes isn't asking much of kids today -- plus - kids today need the exercise!!! BUY IT!!!,1316131200,16,654,4.32520325203252
4503155,3,B004YTL6G0,"I am really disappointed.  I would have liked to know from the description that the bands were a necessary part of using the video.  Admittedly, the workout can be done without, but then there is no resistence.  Having paid over 36.00 for this item new, this would have been nice to know!",1314316800,18,288,4.5
4503156,5,B004YTL6G0,This product is a great way to get fit if you've got a busy schedule. The 10 minute trainer provides a full body workout in 10 minute segments that are easier to perform than those long workout routines that require many many reps and sets! No expensive equipment to buy. Just one excercise band and a wait belt to help make your workout more prodcutive.,1297987200,14,354,4.461538461538462

In hindsight, I would have bought a package with all 5 routines.",1294617600,60,329,4.2063492063492065

4503165,3,B004YTL6G0,"It's alright. Bought this one and the other DVD (for additional exercises) but didn't really take to them. I would have to do a few of the sessions to really feel something (which they recommended for optimal results), but I found myself becoming bored with the exercises and the audio track etc. Often times, he would have bands attached to the dorm frame or somewhere else where I couldn't replicate

When I did do several, I did feel sweaty and tired. Very good if you are short on time. I've started going to the gym more now (spending 1 hr +) and found that to be more beneficial.

What I had often done (since I didn't have the bands) I would swap them in for small dumbbells (5-10lbs) and found those made the workouts a lot harder",1431216000,,738,4.37956204379562

4503168,3,B004YTL6G0,"So I already do Beachbody.  I am doing 21 day fix and love it.  But I do have a couple nights a week where 30 minutes of exercise is just so hard.  So thought this DVD with 10 minute exercises would give me options.  I was not worried about the resistance band because I have one.  But until I played it.. I realized I can not even use it.  I have no clue how it is hooked up to the wall!  So the first exercise is really never going to be used.  The second one can be done by modifications.  But again, not with the resistance band because I just have no clue how to attach it to a wall.  The 3rd one I have yet to try.  So my hopes for this were kinda dashed.  I'll have to make do with my own modifications.  But wished I had known that the band had to be attached to the wall or something.  I might have looked for a different DVD.  I do like that each exercise is 1 minute long... like Autumn's in 21 day fix.",1427414400,5,914,3.838709677419355

Which is basically exactly the same amount of time as P90X3.  He says you can do one workout per day, but for maximum benefit (and presumably to get the results you see in the infomercial) you need to do three - DUH.  I just feel like it's a total bait and switch from the whole premise which is one 10-minute daily workout.",1412380800,20,502,4.208333333333333

I'm here to honestly tell ya that NOTHING works like the 10 Minute Trainer.  I have lost at least 2"" in the past 2 1/2 weeks.  What's really cool is that it just goes so fast and my body doesn't get tired at all.  You don't get cardio to the point that you're struggling to breathe and week in your legs. YOu don't have to ""push"" yourself. No. None of that.  Hey, and the moves are easy and you just breeze on through them. Right now I'm still just a beginner and seeing results.  Can't tell you what a blessing this has been to me.  Every afternoon at 5pm I have a date with Tony : )",1407628800,15,728,4.034965034965035

These workouts are very intense but very effective. Tony is a little bit of a dork but you really don't have time to think about it. He makes you work really hard. The best part about it is that it is only 10 minutes. I have a very busy schedule with kids, work, and church and he makes it easy to get a good workout in the spare time that I have. I bought this along with the other video and it gives you a good variety of workouts to choose from.",1376352000,,578,3.9913793103448274

4503199,3,B004YTL6G0,The problem with this trainer is you need to have resistance bands and  a door to hold the bands in if you are gonna do this work-out.

4503200,4,B004YTL6G0,Great workouts! My only complaint is that two of the workouts require you to use the exercise bands (not included) that attach to your door hinge. I don't have a door that I can use that is convenient to my TV.

I knew 10 minutes would probably work for my body and it's previous restrictions. I started with a DVD by Kathy Smith a 20 minute stretch. Then on to Tony's. I like Tony's work out because it deals with the core and gets the job done with a great feeling you don't have to work out two hours or more. I have now ordered Brazilian butt lift and wowowowow. My body is stronger and getting healthier all the time. I can break up my work out in the A.M. and later in evening. I am getting over an hour workout without being boring. Switching it up also works the body in a better way. No monotonous routine.

8448809,5,B004YTL6G0,"I stumbled across this DVD at a used book sale.  I'm not usually a big Beachbody/Tony Horton fan, but I've been interested in shorter workouts of late, and so I decided to give it a try.  This is actually a follow-up to the original 10-Minute Trainer DVD, which included 5 workouts; I haven't tried that one.

The Main Menu lists the following options:

Total Body 2
Total Body 2 warm-up and cool-down
Core Cardio
Core Cardio warm-up and cool-down
Upper Body
Upper Body warm-up and cool-down
Band to Door Assembly Instructions
Play All

All of the workouts feature a band (tubing) that needs to be anchored to a heavy object or doorway; most tubing sets come with an anchoring mechanism.  This equipment IS necessary for the routines and can't really be easily subbed.  For the cardio workout, however, the band, which is used with a waist attachment, can be skipped.

The warm-up/cool-down sequences are the same for all workouts (including Play All, which is 42 minutes total).  Both feature Tony alone, and both are just under 2 minutes.  In the warm-up, he performs about one minute of gentle aerobic moves such as jogs, twists, knees up, and jacks, and then he continues with dynamic stretches including wide and side squats, lateral stretch, and down dog.  Tony gradually winds down in the cool-down with flowing moves and additional stretches.

The format for each of the three main workouts is 10 moves, each performed for 1 minute.  I have listed all the moves for each workout below.

TOTAL BODY II (11 minutes)
Tony alone
1) Lunge Press and Fly, 2) 3-Speed Row Boat 3) Lunge Flys, 4) 3x4 Curls, 5) 3x4 Throws (triceps), 6) Squat and Lunge, 7) Side Lunge Rotation, 8) 3-Part Ab Crunch, 9) Scissor Fly Crunch Combo, 10) Lunge-Kickback-Curl-Twist

CORE CARDIO (11:12 minutes)
Tony with Gretchen, who is using the band (Tony sometimes follows along without the band)
1) Crescent Press, 2) Oblique Hop Squat, 3) Towel Hop Squat, 4) The Bella Twist, 5) Twisting Sprinter, 6) Speed Skater, 7) Loading Dock, 8) Traveling Body Blows, 9) Arc Twist, 10) Reaching Skater

UPPER BODY (11:15 minutes)
Tony alone
1) 3x5 Chest Press, 2) Lunging Lawnmower, 3) 3-Level Shoulder Press, 4) Crazy Eights, 5) Wide Back/Throw Combo, 6) Incline/Decline Chest Press, 7) High/Low Lat Row, 8) Shoulder Fly/Press Combo, 9) Police Curls, 10) One Arm Tricep Extensions

Overall, I really liked these workouts.  They are quite intense for the short period of time, yet at the same time, they are very doable.  Tony is extremely goofy, but that keeps the routines lighthearted and fun.  I would definitely recommend this DVD.",1495238400,,2604,4.875

Stretching, at night is a very important part of recovery needed, for such an intense exercise schedule. The only way to get an effective stretch is with an adequate warm up.
