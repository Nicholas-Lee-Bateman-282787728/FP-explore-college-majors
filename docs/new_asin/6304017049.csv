756756,5,6304017049,I bought this film for a very reasonable price. I know it has bad reviews everywhere like 3.5 stars out of 5 but it was a childhood favorite of mine for the creative music during all the turning points and clean clear beautiful shots that display the obvious care everyone who works at the Majestic takes in their day to day work plus the hilarious plotline and characters. As well as relatable themes for children like not being believed by their parents when real things are actually happening. My toddler loves it and it still hasn't lost its sheen in my adult eyes either. This movie will always be a 5/5 in my book.,1501977600,,620,4.447368421052632

This film takes place in a 5 star hotel in New York, A hotel manger (Alexander) gets a surprise visit from his boss (Dunnaway) told him that a critic is in the hotel to review the hotel and she wants the sixth star. One tiny problem, an orangutan had escaped from his abusive, greedy, and thieving owner (Everett)  and the orangutan is causing chaos in the hotel. The manger's son (Eric Lloyd) must to help the orangutan escape from the hotel before his father, the hotel owner, the orangutan's owner, and a animal control officer (Pee-Wee Herman) catch the orangutan.

I mean, c'mon, they haven't even sold standard format tv's in almost a decade now. The formatting is tolerable but unnecessary in this day and age. Time to do away with this antiquated format.

The main cast is bland and forgettable. The ""jokes"" are lame and not funny. Worst of all,Dunston the Ape himself wasn't funny. In-fact,all apes and monkeys aren't funny.

I remember years ago in a movie theater a young man behind me kept saying, ""But it could not happen this way, this is totally wrong, it is so unbelievable!""  Everybody in the vicinity of this person was relieved when one of his friends shut him up by saying, ""This is not real life, this is a movie, just have fun and do not bother all of us with your stupid remarks.""

If you are seriously studying the behavior of babies and orangutans, don't watch these two movies.

758324,4,6304017049,"This was surprisingly entertaining and with a few minor exceptions, very inoffensive family fare. It's another one of those adults-and-kids-can-both-enjoy flicks with a number of lines that border on being too much for kids but are still tame for adults - close, but safe. There are also some funny special effects and some good slapstick humor.

Being basically a kids' film, the main child, played by Eric Lloyd is cute but a little too spoiled for me but he's tolerable, as is his brother. Jason Alexander is the father, a very likable subdued guy but a little too lenient.

The real surprise in this cast is Faye Dunaway. Usually playing hard-edged types, she is the opposite in here which is kind of refreshing to see. She shows a nice comedic touch. The chimpanzee is probably the most entertaining, which is the idea, but so is the villain played by Rupert Evert. In other words, there are a lot of likable characters in this movie.

This a ""sleeper:"" an underrated film that a lot of people would enjoy. I'm sorry it never got much ""press.""",1234051200,,1048,4.684782608695652

Chaos ensues.  Viewers between the ages of 4-94 will be unable to keep a straight face, and one of the movie's attributes is that it does appeal both to children and adults.  Younger viewers can identify with Jason Alexander's two sons who live in the hotel their father manages and who first discover Dunston's identity.  Adult viewers can identify with the travails of the hotel manager as he attempts to keep chaos from triumphing during the hotel's biggest party of the year, during which of course the finicky owner and an ""undercover"" hotel inspector are also checking for dust.

(Did anyone see Ed with Matt LeBlanc, yeah, i didn't think so) All those that feel that the genre of monkey movies is almost dead should see the brilliant Dunston Checks In. This film has it all: a monkey that wreaks havoc in a swanky hotel, and Jason Alexander really overacting. Jason, lighten up bud! you are in a monkey movie! The real pleasure comes in knowing that this film was an attempt to breath life into the monkey movie genre, a field that has been over looked by the Oscars for numerous years. The only problem with this film is that it is far too short. When will filmakers realize that monkey films should be epics, not 90 minute comedies. Give me an epic monkey movie over the same old Martin Lawrence and Eddie Murphy garbage anyday. Dunston, i think i speak for everyone when i say: I love you!",977011200,8,939,4.402298850574713
