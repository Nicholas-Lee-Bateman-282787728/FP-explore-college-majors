383558,4,6301965639,"If you like college musicals, you'll love this fast paced MGM piece of fluff. The story is simple, a military college cadet wins a date with Hollywood actress Lucille Ball (In one of many performances where she plays  herself) This ill conceived publicity stunt designed to re-start her  faltering career, turns into a hilarious disaster when the cadet's  girlfriend shows-up the night of the big date. You can imagine the fun that  ensues with Lucy hiding out in the cadet's dorm room closet which continues  to get more crowed by the minute. The musical numbers are all classic, like  Harry James' swing version of ""Flight of the Bumble Bee,"" and the  rollicking ""Barrelhouse, Boogie, and The Blues,"" beautifully performed by  Nancy Walker, June Allison, and Gloria DeHaven. This was their MGM debut  film and they all went on to stardom.
This is one of MGM's better  musicals from the forties, it is full of great music, lively dancing and  just plain fun and let's face it Lucille Ball is absolutely georgous.
I  highly recommend this film!",955584000,39,1044,4.869318181818182
383559,5,6301965639,"Lucy looks absolutely fabulous in this movie, just like she does in every other movie. She is a brilliant actress, and it shows in this film. Her talent comes shining through. She's very funny at times, especially when  her fans rip off her clothes and she slaps a man. She's left there in her  underwear, and she constantly has to hide in closets(poor dear!). This is a  very good movie, so if you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and do  watch it.

383903,5,6301965639,"We're lucky that Lucille Ball was in this fun little musical or it may have never seen the light of day on video or DVD. Aimed at the younger audience, this film is full of swing music and an energetic young cast and would be good even if a lesser actress than Lucy had played her role. Of course Lucy did not become a superstar until television, and worked her way up from bit roles in the thirties (notably in Stage Door), to featured and co-starring roles in comedies and the occasional noir; she became known as ""the Queen of the B's""). At first considered merely glamorous, here she showed her gift for comedy that would later take her far.

Best Foot Forward had already been a hit musical on Broadway in 1941, and most of the principal cadets and girls here were taken from the Broadway cast. In an unusual move, the studio had them playing different roles than they did on stage, even though it hardly mattered since the roles were fairly interchangeable. For example, Bud's two buddies are Hunk Hoyt and Dutch Miller and they mainly offer comic support., and don't have developed character traits. But the ever-mugging Kenny Bowers played Hunk on the stage, but Dutch here. It goes the same for the girls except for Nancy Walker who created her comic persona as the unfeminine ""blind date"" in the stage musical. Because of the War, the setting was changed from a College to a Military Academy.

The movie is the work of the early ""Freed Unit"", producer-composer Arthur Freed and his extremely talented staff who would make most of MGM's great musicals of the 40's and 50's, peaking with Meet Me In St. Louis and Singing In the Rain. The group here, including Charles Walters as choreographer was working on the Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland musical Girl Crazy at about the same time and it has much the same swing feeling, though with Tommy Dorsey instead of Harry James. The songs are fun from the opening Wish I May in which all the cadets welcome the visiting girls to the campus to the big dance number The Three B's, led by the girl trio of June Allyson, Gloria De Haven and Nancy Walker in their first movie roles. Even Lucy has a solo song with You're Lucky. The big hit was Buckle Down Winsocki, a college fight song, odd in that in this musical there is no Big Game, or sports at all. It's played at the beginning as the titles roll and at the end is sung by Tommy Dix (""Bud Cooper"") in the Graduation scene. That's really him singing, too. Despite a baby face and relatively high speaking voice, he sang in a deep, booming baritone; sort of the Rick Astley of his day.

The plot is as lightweight and trivial as can be, probably the weakest element in the mix, but this was always conceived as a minor musical and was never meant to be Oklahoma! The film has a high level of craft and energy and is definitely worth a look.",1426377600,2,2839,4.466281310211946

I bought that song before I bought the movie! The other thing that caught my attention was Lucille Ball. In the restaurant I couldn't hear the movie, so I made note of what I saw and investigated about the name. When I found it I watched it online. I laughed so hard! I think what made this movie was all the subtle cross-referencing from what was really going on at the time to what was happening in the movie (Lucille Ball's career, her playing herself in the movie, Harry James' career, etc...). I don't think this movie got as much attention as it probably should have when it was released. Still, it has become a favorite of mine. AND...had I lived during the time this came out - I would have done ANYTHING to meet Tommy Dix! He is beyond adorable!",1421280000,,911,4.333333333333333

383907,4,6301965639,"Fans of Forties movie musicals and lovers of Lucy will do all right with BEST FOOT FORWARD, a 1943 musical featuring Harry James and orchestra, starring Lucille Ball and Nancy Walker, and set at fictional ""Winsockie Military Academy"" in Pennsylvania.  The school's fight song of ""Buckle Down, Winsockie"" -- which, believe me, you have heard even if you don't know the lyrics --  is used as an instrumental over the opening credits as well as a chorale at the end of this lighthearted movie.  Along with the military-school ambience, there's a definite World War II aspect to this film, in which juveniles predominate: teenaged boys in the school provide the necessary energy (and look great in uniforms, especially in dance numbers); and the girls, bused in to attend the pre-graduation Senior Prom, are an amiable bunch headed by Nancy Walker, but also including young hopefuls such as June Allyson and Gloria deHaven.

Virginia Weidler, whom many will remember as ""Little Mary Haines"" in George Cukor's all-female THE WOMEN (1940) and later that same year as the smart-assedly hilarious Dinah Lord in THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, is on hand as a misunderstood teen forced to switch roles with Lucille Ball (playing as herself) due to an only-in-Hollywood mix-up of identities and priorities.  The songs are generally quite good, and Henry James' trumpet on such numbers as the popular ""Bumble Boogie"" is something to hear as well as see.  There is not much dancing except standard Forties ballroom style, but sung novelty numbers like ""Barrelhouse, Boogie and the Blues"" by Mesdames de Haven, Walker and Allyson add zest.  Four years later June Allyson had grown up enough to play the female lead in campus college musical GOOD NEWS (1947, set in 1927) opposite Peter Lawford, a more assured and colorful outing by the emergent Freed Group at MGM.  Lucy, as always, is wonderful and photographs so well in color; the spectacle of adolescent boys a head shorter than she capering around her is odd, but not repellent.  BEST FOOT FORWARD costs an awful lot at the present, making GOOD NEWS a viable and satisfying alternative among MGM musicals of the Forties for the cost-conscious.

Trivia Note:  This was Virginia Weidler's last movie.

384058,4,6301965639,"Released by MGM in 1943 and directed by Edward Buzzell, ""Best Foot Forward"" was the screen adaptation of the highly successful Broadway musical/comedy of the same name

Lucille Ball portrays herself in the film as a motion picture star, whose last few films didn't do very well at the box office.  She receives an invitation from a young fan, Bud Hooper (Tommy Dix), to be his date for the prom at his school, Winsocki Military Academy.  Convinced by her opportunistic manager that she needed the extra publicity, she accepts the invite.  Hooper tells his girlfriend and original prom date, Helen (Virginia Weidler) that he is sick in bed so Ball could be his date for the prom.  Problems and comedy ensues when Helen shows up at the school unexpectedly to care for her ""sick "" boyfriend.

Although the plot is a bit flimsy, its the music and comedy that makes this film so enjoyable.  Ball is just wonderful, and it is a delight to see her interacting with her young costars while she brilliantly spoofs her own image.  Tommy Dix was in a number of films in the 1940s, but his powerful voice was not really used in this film until the last song of the movie.  Kenny Bowers was spot on as Hooper's hammy roommate,""Dutch"", as was William Gaxton as Ball's inept publicity agent.  A special mention goes to Chill Wills as a bumbling newspaper man.

The young supporting women in this movie were absolutely wonderful.  June Allyson, Nancy Walker, and Gloria De Haven would all go on to be major stars.  Unfortunately, this would be the last movie for MGM stalwart, Virginia Weidler.  After growing up in front of the camera, Weidler was unable to successfully transition into more adult roles. After this film, she practically vanished into obscurity.
Nancy Walker, who made a career out of self-depreciating humor, steals nearly every scene she is in.  Walker, DeHaven and Allyson team up for the show-stopping number, ""The Three Bs"", and are backed by Harry James and his orchestra.

The musical score was written by songwriting team Hugh Martin and Ralph Blaine.  Although this was their first musical score for a film, it wouldn't be their last.  They also wrote the score for ""Meet Me In St Louis"".

Although it is certainly not the best musical film in the MGM catalog, it most certainly was one of its most enthusiastic.  If you aren't looking for anything deep, and just want to have an hour or two of simple entertainment, this movie is worth a look.

Trivia---The back lot and set used to film ""Best Foot Forward"" was also used to film the 1947 college musical, ""Good News"".

384173,5,6301965639,"Best Foot Forward is an excellent MGM movie with laughs, action and musical numbers that pack a punch! There's Harry James & His Orchestra; Lucille Ball, Nancy Walker in her film debut, June Allyson and more. The plot moves along at a very good pace and with the musical numbers you won't be bored. The cinematography is excellent and I was particularly impressed with the choreography; the scenes in which they have the senior prom are superlative. The other casting worked well, too.

When the action starts, we quickly meet young Bud Hooper (Tommy Dix) who's in a bit of trouble, to say the least. He has written a fan letter to Lucille Ball; and unbeknownst to him and the others at Winsocki Military Academy, Lucille Ball's luck in films has turned so sour that she is actually headed to Bud's senior prom to be his date--and get some publicity to win back her Hollywood fame and fortune. Trouble is, however, that Bud's girlfriend Helen Schlesinger (Virginia Weidler) is coming to be with Bud because he told her he had the flu--so that she would stay away! Lots of problems start to happen real fast when Helen arrives unexpectedly at Bud's school and she sees that Bud is perfectly fine--and going with Lucille Ball as his date to the senior prom.

If that isn't enough to get some action going, there's also the issue that Bud needs Lucille to go by his girlfriend's name Helen; before Bud knew Lucille was really coming he told his school that Helen would in fact be his date for the prom. Lucille isn't happy about this but with a little bit of prodding, partly from her agent Jack O'Riley (William Gaxton), she decides to play along and hopes that she'll get some good publicity at the prom with Bud and his two other roommates Hunk (Jack Jordan) and ""Dutch"" Miller (Kenny Bowers). We also meet Nancy (Nancy Walker) who plays a young girl on a blind date to help her father's potential business deal, but when Nancy sees her date ""Greenie"" (Bob Stebbins) she's not exactly happy, either.

The musical numbers are excellent. We get Harry James & His Orchestra playing swing music and more of the day an there's even a brief version of ""Flight of the Bumble Bee."" Look also for Nancy, Ethel (June Allyson) and Minerva (Gloria DeHaven) to sing a grand tune called ""The Three Bs.""

Of course, the plot can go anywhere from here. When Helen shows up at the prom and sees Bud dancing with Lucille, she starts a ""souvenir collecting"" riot that results in Lucille's dress being torn off to leave Lucille standing there in her slip! Will Helen ever be able to forgive Bud? What about the school officials including Major Reeber (Henry O'Neill) and Captain Bradd (Donald MacBride)--how will they discipline Bud or otherwise handle this situation? And will Nancy find love? No plot spoilers here, folks--watch and find out!

The DVD has an extra entitled The Knight Is Young; this is quite good. In addition, there's a cartoon entitled One Ham's Family.

Best Foot Forward is quite funny and the musical numbers along with the plot are excellent. I highly recommend this film for people who enjoy classic movie musicals; and fans of the great Lucille Ball will not be disappointed.",1248134400,,3182,4.703770197486535

384177,5,6301965639,"I just finished watching Best Foot Forward for the first time.  Being a staunch classic movie fan, the talent is so superior to anything we have today, I don't know how I missed this one; but I won't miss it again as I had to purchase a copy on the spot.

TALENT,TALENT, AND MORE TALENT.  That about sums this movie up.  The plot is predictable, the story light but FUN, FUN, FUN.  Lucy is great in what I can only assume is an accurate portrayal of herself.  The supporting cast outstanding.  Most reprising their Broadway roles.

But what blew my mind was Tommy Dix!!  I did not know of him before I saw him today and could not believe his voice.  Sixteen and seventeen performing this roll on Broadway and eighteen for the movie.  Unbelievable!!  So amazing that I thought it had to be dubbed and was so thrilled to learn that it is indeed his voice.  I would have been standing in the aisles cheering his rousing rendition of Winsocki had I had the good fortune to see him perform it on Broadway.  And it is obvious by the smile on his face in the movie, that he enjoys performing this number. Thank goodness it is on film to cherish and enjoy over and over again. It is rare that an actor gives one performance that leaves people with such a long lasting impression.  Tommy Dix is that rare actor, and his Winsocki that one in a million performance.

Along with Micky Rooney's movies you could class this as one of the original High School Musicals.  The cadets at Winsocki Military Academy having their Senior Prom and Graduation with aspirations for acceptance to West Point the University.  What I found most enjoyable is that with few exceptions, June Allyson was 25 and Lucy 32 at the time of shooting, the student cast was indeed in their teens and high school age.  Not like today when the ""teen"" for the most part is well into their 20's.  Just another documentation of the talent in that era of film making.

So give yourself a real treat and watch this movie as soon as you can.  It will no doubt leave you with a big smile on your face too.  Enjoy, its a real treasure.",1215129600,,2085,4.386422976501305
384178,4,6301965639,"If your fondest memories of Lucille Ball are of her as a zany TV sitcom housewife doing her darndest to BREAK INTO show biz, you might this 1943 screen musical an interesting contrast.  In BEST FOOT FORWARD she plays a Hollywood INSIDER, an established actress--admittedly one in a bit of a box office slump and eager for some effective publicity.  And interestingly enough, she plays an actress named ""Lucille Ball""--or as the credits would have it, she is ""by herself.""

At first blush, it would seem perhaps a little, well, unusual for an established film actress to be playing ""box office poison"" under her own name.  Had she called herself ""Lola Beck"" or ""Linda Blaine"" in the film, it still might have been clear that her character was based on Lucille Ball, without having to admit, even jokingly, that she had experienced a a few box office bombs in recent years.  But then maybe I'm not giving the audiences of the 1940s enough credit.  They probably ""got"" the joke just fine and enjoyed seeing the ""Queen of the B's"" play ""herself"" in an obviously farcical context.

The PR stunt Lucy gets involved in--on the advice of her agent--is to accept the invitation of a young fan at a Winsocki Military Academy to be his date for the ""prom.""  She's expecting a lot of attention, but Bud Hooper (Tommy Dix), the young cadet who extended the invitation, never actually expected her to take him up on the offer, and has already made plans to attend with his own best gal Helen (Virginia Weidler).  Of course, all kinds of mix-ups and highjinks ensue--not the least of which is that Bud and his friends concoct a scheme to have Ball attend the ball under Helen's name (not her own).  Hmm, some publicity scheme that is!

The boys also conspire to keep the glamorous actress OFF the dancefloor, lest all the young wolves in the ""stagline"" (or was it ""stags in the wolfline""?) try to horn in.  As you might expect, the real Helen does show up on campus to nobly nurse young Hooper, who had given her the time honored excuse that he had the ""grippe,"" and the anticipatedcomplications ensue.  Lucy's agent creates further confusion by sneaking into the ball, dressed as a waiter.  All vintage farcical fare, some of which may fall a little flat for 21st century viewers and some of which will still raise a chuckle or two.

The musical numbers are lively and feature talented young performers who would go on to make their mark in musical film history.  June Allyson is on board, as is Gloria DeHaven and a sharply comic Nancy Walker. And of course, the Harry James Orchestra is on hand to provide the musical entertainment for the Winsocki Military Academy Prom (well, why not?).  Like so many wartime films, it ends with the boys being forgiven for their antics and a strong dose of patriotic fervor during the final graduation scene (as the boys ready themselves for the next stage of their military careers and an American flag is superimposed over the closing credits).

BEST FOOT FORWARD is definitely of its era.  As a period piece, it's certainly of interest.  It's scarcely a ""classic musical,"" but it's certainly enjoyable.  Although there's more emphasis placed on Lucy's status as a glamour girl, the comic timing that would make her a television legend is already on display.",1200096000,2,3284,4.726315789473684
384179,3,6301965639,"Best Foot Forward is a pleasant diversion to watch even still today. It was originally a successful Broadway play which MGM got the rights to and filmed in colour.
The movie was definitely aimed at a teenage audience to inspire them to get into the military swing of things,you might say. It concerns three young cadet sergeants and their girls. There is an up coming prom with the neighbouring girls school but one of the sergeants has written to Lucille Ball who has unexpectedly accepted his invitation to attend the prom with him. Now he has the task of trying to keep his girl from finding out AND attending the prom. To top things off Lucille Ball,due to academy rules,can only go with him under his girlfriends' name! And she's only there at her managers' insistence,to get publicity! His girlfriend eventually finds out,and boy falls out with girl,mayhem ensues but alls well that ends well.
The plot is nothing special and the script could/should have been much better. Instead alot of the lines are plain,trite and miss the mark much too often. Lucille Ball unfortunately gives her best but just isn't given enough of signifigance to say or do.
However there are two elements that save the movie. The first is Nancy Walker who does a terrific turn as a smart alecky debutante. She provides the film with the majority of its' laughs.
The second is Harry James. I have always considered him to be the greatest trumpet player of the 20th century and this movie provides more than ample proof,and all within two numbers. The first is ""Two O'Clock Jump"",one of his big hits and a real great jump tune. The second is ""Flight of the Bumblebee"".There are no adjectives that I could use to adequately describe the fingerwork and technique on this number. It was astonishing to watch in /43 and is STILL a wonder to this day. He even does a duet dance number with Nancy Walker. And all this in colour!
And speaking of colour. This print generally is very good. There are a couple of short cut scenes that appear a little out of focus but other than that it looks like it was filmed yesterday.
To recap; Best Foot Forward while ""OSCAR caliber"" is NOT one of its' attributes,and while it is a film very much of its' time,it is still a very plesant diversion. It is in crisp colour and Lucille Ball fans will find a nice spot for it in their library I'm sure. Also to watch out for is a young Gloria De Haven and June Allyson. Nancy Walker is the comic standout and Harry James rounds things out beautifully in the music department with his peerless horn playing.
I might also add that the soundtrack is still available,but not for long. It is made by Rhino records in a very limited addition CD.Only 2500 copies have been pressed in all so may I suggest if you like the numbers in this movie you will love the CD also.",1190937600,,2816,4.5452755905511815
384180,5,6301965639,"This is a wonderful musical that moves along at a quick pace. June Allyson made I believe her screen dubut along with the wonderful Nancy Walker who shines here. Lucille Ball also plays herself, a movie star who Hollywood thinks is washed up. Her agent sets her up on a prom date with a student from a military school. Complications ensue and the laughs begin. A great movie for when you want to escape the pressues of today.",1184803200,,425,4.461538461538462
384181,5,6301965639,"That this bit of fluff has long been one of my favorite movies may not be the best advertisement for my taste, but it truly is a wonderful bit of fluff.  Lucille Ball shows well, but oddly enough her presence is interesting mostly because we rarely get to see much of her pre-TV work.  It's worth getting just for that.

It's the music and the youngsters that make this one so much fun, though.  The early Nancy Walker is hilarious and something of a revelation. Her business with a bass drum still cracks me up, thirty odd years after the first time I saw it.  June Allyson and Gloria DeHaven are likewise seen at the beginnings of their careers, and show why they went on to be so notable.  The three of them doing ""The Three B's"" are a treat.  Allyson and DeHaven also shine in the opening number (""Wish I May"" - MGM used almost the same scene and setup for this as they did for the opening of Good News three years later).  The then veteran Virginia Weidler is the actually the weakest link among the young women and this was one of her last performances on screen, but she gave a very affecting, if truncated, rendition of ""Every Time.""

The male leads are also good, although they don't stand out quite as much.  Tommy Dix did a great job with the rousing Buckle Down Winsocki.  Jack Jordan was handsome and stalwart in his role.  Kenny Bowers was a direct contrast with the other two, being a definite ham.  The three of them showed very well singing ""Three Men on A Date.""

I doubt too many 1940's military academies had Harry James' band playing the dances at the senior prom and Lucille Ball making a surprise guest appearance.  But it's all done with so much humor and spirit that you can't help but have a hell of a good time watching what happens when they do.  Bring it out on DVD please.",1181347200,,1802,4.350299401197605
384260,2,6301965639,"Though I am a fan of Lucille Ball movies, I found this movie to be quite dull and overacted. I don't know why a director would think that the particular hijinks of the college boys in this film would be entertaining. The inept acting or comedic timing was distracting though the storyline was anticipated to be promising. I feel I wasted my money on this DVD.",1178928000,,359,4.454545454545454
384261,4,6301965639,This is a great movie to just sit down and relax to.  I gave it four stars mainly because the comedy today cannot match the comedy movies of yesteryear.

384262,5,6301965639,"I absolutely love this film! The title song Wynsocki always gets my foot to tapping. The Three B's sung by newcomers June Allyson, Gloria DeHaven and Nancy Walker is also a crowd pleaser. Lucille Ball shows her flavor for comedy almost a decade before her beloved television show. She also is quite beautiful and smartly decked out in MGM's gorgeous technicolor. The character actors are imo what makes the film. Look for Donald MacBride, Sara Haden, Nana Bryant, Henry O'Neil and Isabel Randolph. Harry James and his orchestra are in top form as usual. Child star and imo underrated actress Virginia Weidler appears in her last film at the age of 17. Beverly Tyler also has a small role. I don't know if this film can be or should be compared with 1947's Good News. Both are great on their own merit. This film can be enjoyed anytime and am so glad its on dvd. The picture and beautiful color are both flawless and they truly do not make films like this anymore. ENJOY!",1171843200,6,970,4.580459770114943

384265,4,6301965639,"'Best Foot Forward' was originally a Broadway play.  MGM brought it and a majority of its cast to make a film version.
Lucille Ball plays herself, in the film.  As enjoyable as Lucille Ball was on 'I Love Lucy,' I find, I rather prefer her film roles.  'Best Foot Forward' is no exception.  I would have to say it is my favorite film in which Lucy plays herself.
In addition, this film provides us with June Allyson's second feature film (MGM brought her out for 'Best Foot Forward' but delays in filming made 'Girl Crazy' her first).  On Broadway Allyson played Minerva but in the film she is credited as Ethel.
Nancy Walker is a hoot and Gloria DeHaven (who was not in the play) rounds out the Three Bs.

As much as I enjoy this film the main reason I'd buy this DVD is because of the Broadway Brevity 'The Knight is Young.'  It was the first time I had ever seen June Allyson and I have adored her ever since.",1166572800,5,912,4.267441860465116

A great movie too, much better than DuBarry Was a Lady that she made right before this one.",1158192000,8,368,4.590909090909091
384269,4,6301965639,"Best Foot Forward came to Hollywood on the success of the stage show. It brought much of the original cast to the MGM lot, many to make careers there. This film fits well in movie format even though some scenes belie it's origins.

The story happens in a small town at a military academy. Bud (Tommy Dix) is a senior and a fan of Lucille Ball. He invites her to his prom never imagining that she'd accept his invitation. When she does so for the publicity, he has to dump his girlfriend Helen (Virginia Weidler) in order to take Lucille. However, Helen gets wise to his antics and contemplates crashing the prom to get back her boyfriend.

As a musical based on a stage show, there are many other notable characters. Nancy Walker plays a frumpy blind date with plenty of personality but very few beaus. June Allyson makes her first film appearance as a singer who loves frantic dancing. Gloria deHaven is right alongside her as a singer who loves the blues.

The music is very good; none of the numbers are dull. None of the music is so catchy that you'll find yourself singing it later, but it certainly spices up the film.",1156032000,15,1124,4.4731707317073175

Lucille isn't quite as enthusiastic as he is, especially when she finds herself easy prey for a lot of hormonal teens at the military academy Winsocki.  And then theres the angry spurned love interest (Virginia Weidler as Helen Schlesinger) out for revenge when her boyfriend puts her on hold in favor of a much older woman!  Theres loads of music, singing and dancing, humor (thanks in large part to Nancy Walker as Nancy), and a running gag with a closet.  Lucille dishes out the sarcasm with great aplomb.  And!
