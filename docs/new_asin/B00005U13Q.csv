I don't know what ancient equipment the DVD was transcribed thru but I can make better DVDs that this with home equipment. Early Ken Wahl. I'm a fan of his. Not a super movie but if you like Ken, it is worth watching.",1297468800,,313,3.984126984126984
7954263,1,B00005U13Q,"Sundry video titles for this sloppily made movie include RUNNING SCARED, BACK IN THE U.S.A., and PANIC ESCAPE, but by any name it is fundamentally a mess, with weak performances on display throughout, and with production values being wantonly neglected as are normal measures of logic and continuity.  Set in 1961, the scenario involves two young GIs: Chas (Ken Wahl) and Leroy (Judge Reinhold), freshly mustered out from tours of duty in Panama, who while hopping an Army cargo plane to Florida, native state of Leroy, take advantage of an opportunity for the latter to test his new infra red capability camera by snapping a picture of what turns out to be a clandestine U.S. military base, and when it is revealed that such a photograph is made, a less than cordial reaction is naturally forthcoming from Army intelligence officers.  These latter, preparing for the Bay Of Pigs invasion of Cuba, pursue the former servicemen, and although it is not explained how their identity is learned, this is apparently of little concern to those responsible for this foolishness, and it will come as no surprise that the chase after the two young men is enacted by only Cuban soldiers who cavort about the Everglades terrorizing U. S. citizens while utilizing weapons and vehicles not manufactured until well past 1961.  In the course of their flight, the youths are reluctantly joined by Sally Mae (Annie McEnroe), and the trio is tasked with surviving numerous rounds of machine gun ammunition fired at them, bombs dropped from a plane upon them, and so forth, all this while doing a good deal of shouting and screaming, with Leroy determined to lug his Army issue foot locker with him no matter the hazard or whenever the scriptors are disposed to remember this particular plot motif.  Poorly written, directed, and edited, the film wants focus from its outset, and only one filled with admiration for a featured player is likely to weather these moronic goings-on, as the dialogue is woefully trite, with Reinhold particularly unbridled.",1105574400,2,2033,4.988200589970502
