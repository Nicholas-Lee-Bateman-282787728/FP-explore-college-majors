8308854,4,B001HL00XS,"Robin Franzi has produced a thoughtful very low budget documentary about people in the BDSM lifestyle, emphasizing their normality and the ordinariness of their every day lives. The movie begins with her narration stating that after the end of a marriage she felt her self drawn to experiment with this lifestyle and gradually entered it with some anxiety about the implications for her life and sense of self. The movie then presents a series of vignettes with various people in the lifestyle indulging in the kinks they enjoy and then talking about their daily lives and how the two relate to each other.  Franzi herself finally appears on screen to engage in a scene as a dominatrix with a male submissive. It was important to the movie's credibility that Franzi actually appear in the film since it was ostensibly about her entry into the BDSM lifestyle.  The film is very low budget (Shot-on-video) and I had the feeling like there could have been more but on the whole an impressive portrait that does not sensationalize its subject.

It's not porn, it's not meant to be titillating, but it is a very interesting documentary.  The production value is a little lacking in parts, but the story being told is probably too interesting for most to pay much attention to the occasional lack of production value.",1257206400,2,360,4.609375
