7908894,1,B00000G3OK,"...sigh, which would have been okay, except for I didn't know the tape was messed up as we had stopped it, turned it off, and had it in the VCR to resume the next day.  However, we decided to not watch it at the time and so I ejected it out of the VCR, well, the tape was on the outside of the case & somehow that has given my VCR the message that it cannot move past that point, so now we cannot watch any of our DVDs or VHS tapes and am left trying to find someone who can help us figure out how to fix our VCR.  The video itself was pretty dull, slow, not very interesting which is why we decided to save it for another time.",1376092800,,628,3.786259541984733
7908895,4,B00000G3OK,"This is a well produced video, but the fact it can only be watched as a VHS makes it very difficult to use.  It was well worth it once I dug out my VHS player.  The Ttouch techniques were clearly demonstrated and easily understood.",1362873600,,231,4.2272727272727275
7908896,5,B00000G3OK,I use this technique with my horses every day. What you will learn in this series is a way to develop mutual trust and communication with your horse. It is an invaluable training tool.,1169769600,5,184,4.4411764705882355
