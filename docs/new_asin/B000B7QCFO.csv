8082952,5,B000B7QCFO,"Buy this DVD if you want a great butt fast!  I couldn't believe the results.  The video is divided into 3 parts; butt, thigh, and abs.  Each segment is only 10 minutes long so the time passes quickly.  It is actually fun and you will feel the workout.
  The woman who leads the workouts encourages you and she is likable.  She has two other women on her set to demonstrate high impact and low impact.
  Very effective!",1300665600,,418,4.324675324675325
8082953,4,B000B7QCFO,"The box says 40 minutes running time but that's including the intro and the credits. I was disappointed by this because I bought it thinking I was going to get a longer workout.

But after using it, I found the workout to be good enough for the 25-30 minutes that it runs. The leg workout is good and, even though it runs a bit long, the ab workout is good too.

There are some odd cueing moments when you and the back-up workout girls aren't sure if you should be joinging or what you should be doing. But once you get the hang of it, these small pauses are easy to interpret and continue through.",1203552000,,598,4.191304347826087
8082954,5,B000B7QCFO,"This DVD was in the library so I figured I tried it out because I got bored with Slim in 6.  Turned out it's another GREAT exercise DVD (I can't believe it's sitting in a library along with other Yoga for mommy DVDs).

Shpresa is cute, outgoing and very fun to work out with.  Her exercise moves and routines are mixed with some of the standard ones you've seen in other DVDs plus some fresh ones I have never seen before.  They are somewhat not too easy - not to hard to follow.  It won't bored you to death and won't discourage you from quitting!

The ABS part is pretty hard (I'm just a beginner) but overall, I was able to complete the entire 30 mins with only minimal rest.

I really like Double Pump - Lower body and I'm thinking of buying both DP Lower Body and Total Body to add on to my exercise DVD collections :)",1186358400,2,823,4.138364779874214
8082955,4,B000B7QCFO,"This is perfect if you want a good, fast paced workout. The first section is squats, lunges, and kicks; then floorwork for your legs; then a thorough ab section. I like it because it gives your muscles a good burn but you're not doing endless reps. I would do a more thorough leg workout in addition to this but it does a good job. Make sure to add heavier weights to make it harder. The ab section is tough.",1184544000,6,408,4.177215189873418
8082956,5,B000B7QCFO,"I borrowed this from the library to test run and I'll be buying my own copy. I don't consider myself a weakling but I am a little bit out of shape. I do a lot of toning ball exercises, but what I needed was something that got me sweating and burning, and this definitely does. One can tell that they are simultaneously getting you worked up to burn fat, and also targeting specific areas. Like the reviewer below said, a lot harder than it looks, and I'm glad, as it gives me a goal to work toward. Shpresa is easy to follow and a good personality.",1172707200,9,548,4.179245283018868
8082957,5,B000B7QCFO,"This is a great way to work your lower body. It's fast and very effective. No materials are needed, but you can easily add weights to increase difficulty. The video is divided into five sections that you can watch individually or consecutively. You begin with a warm-up, followed by squats and lunges. Then you move to the floor for a butt routine followed by abs and conclude with stretching. I exercise regularly and was happy to find the routine challenging. Because weights are optional it's great for people of all fitness levels.",1158624000,10,535,4.826086956521739
8082958,5,B000B7QCFO,This is by far my favorite lower body workout I've found so far.  These routines made me lean and not bulky so I look toned and lean rather than bulky like a body builder.  Shpresa is motivating without being annoying.  This workout is the perfect length to piggyback with another workout.  Love this video,1158105600,5,306,4.611111111111111
8082959,5,B000B7QCFO,"I'm just starting on an ""at home"" workout routine. I started with the lower body workout because it's where I need to target most. The workout was intense on the abs but great for building a nice stomach. I'll probably buy the full-body workout. Shpresa makes it simple and easy to follow in only 30 minutes of my day!",1148947200,10,318,4.406779661016949
