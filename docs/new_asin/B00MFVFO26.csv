6576976,5,B00MFVFO26,"Special note before I review: If the price is more than $15 on Amazon, buy directly from the creator of this series (Herald Entertainment). It's ridiculous that at the time of this review this is being sold on Amazon for over $30!

The Saints begins with Brother Francis teaching himself to roller-blade and falling down a lot. He asks the children to remember when they were learning to do something like how to ride a bike, swim, or read. I have to admit I wasn't sure where this was going at first, but once he said, ""We all do better when we have encouragement and when we have someone to learn from,"" it clicked! We're going to talk about how the Saints are they to encourage us and serve as examples who have been there before us.

Before he starts talking about the Saints, he shows secular examples that adults and children look up to, such as musicians and athletes. Then, we dive into the Saints! Brother Francis explains that the Saints are like our family, even if we don't have a family. We see examples of children using the Saints in times of discouragement, but what I found fascinating was that we also see Mother Teresa (a future saint) also turned to the Saints, specifically St. Therese of Lisieux. One saint in particular receives special attention in this episode and that is John Bosco. Your children will learn a lot from this little boy, who grew up to become a great saint and led many people to Jesus. Also of great educational value is a step-by-step explanation on how people become Saints.

All of these DVDs are high quality. Whenever anyone asks me for good Catholic programs that their children can watch and will enjoy, Brother Francis are always the first two words out of my mouth. What's also great about this series is that it is more than DVDs. They have dozens of coloring books that correspond with the DVDs or focus on a particular saint. There are also kid-friendly Holy Cards modeled in the same style as the graphical style as the DVDs. Last, but not least, they have introduced a matching game that your young kids will both enjoy and learn a lot from!",1411516800,11,2098,4.544973544973545
8671976,5,B00MFVFO26,"This is a great DVD for young children to help teach them about the Faith. My little boy who is 2.5 years old pays attention to it for the entire time. The animation is very good. Above all, it teaches the Truths of the Faith in a simple and easy to understand way. Occasionally my son would rather play than watch this DVD. I think it is mainly geared for children 3 and over but children under 3 can benefit from it as well.",1524268800,,426,4.083333333333333
