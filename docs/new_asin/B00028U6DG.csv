8024139,1,B00028U6DG,"Having been interested and studied WW11 history for many years i was hesitant to spend $35 on this dvd. A complete waste of money! I was hoping to get new and concentrated information as the title suggested "" Operation Barbarossa....""The Epic Eastern Campaign That Led To Nazi Germany's Downfall ""  I should have followed my gut feeling.  It is 1 dvd which has 12 scenes and doesn't get to the actual commencement of the operation Barbarossa till scene 11!!!.  If you have no formal knowledge of the lead up to the june 22 1941 BARBAROSSA invasion then this may interest you. All Peter Batty Productions have done is to concentrate of the events leading up to invasion which requires little effort to compile!! Please don't waste your money.
Something much cheaper will be just as good, if not better!!",1484092800,,802,4.755395683453237
8024140,5,B00028U6DG,"Operation Barbarossa was the code name for the German invasion of Russia in June of 1941.  This informative documentary examines the diplomacy and events leading up to the biggest and bloodiest front in World War II.  Topics presented include Stalin's Red Army purges, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the carving up of Poland, the Russo-Finnish War of 1939-1940, and the rapid gains made by the German army in the initial stages of Operation Barbarossa.  We learn that the purges of the Russian army in the 1930s weakened the army and stifled initiative.  This, in turn, enabled the German army to advance quickly into Russian territory in the summer of 1941; the heavy Russian casualties in the Russo-Finnish War also weakened the psyche of the Soviet army.  Commentary from Albert Speer (a close associate of Adolf Hitler and minister of Armaments and War Production in World War II) and Walter Warlimont (a high ranking German leader) are included in the narrative.  The video also includes archival footage from both German and Russian sources.  In sum, this is a concise and informative documentary about one of the most significant events in both World War II and world history.",1458259200,,1181,5.056701030927835

8024142,4,B00028U6DG,"For anyone who wants the background on Hitler's ill-fated move to invade Russia before defeating England, this little dvd will do the trick. It's really only 45 minutes, however, not 60 as advertised.",1280880000,5,200,5.090909090909091
8024143,5,B00028U6DG,"It does a great job explaining the events leading to Hitler's decision to invade Russia. The international politics of the time been one of them.  Incidentally, also discusses why Hitler did not invade England, and how such decision related to operation Barbarossa. While much of the material is also in  ""The World At War"" DVD set, here is better organized and linked to this particular topic.",1208390400,8,394,4.954545454545454
8024144,4,B00028U6DG,Basic and to the point! Would recommend to anyone interested in the subject.,1181347200,4,76,4.923076923076923
