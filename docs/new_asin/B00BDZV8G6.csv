I feel cheated somehow.  signed. Dr. Z.",1423440000,,289,5.020833333333333

5582211,5,B00BDZV8G6,Worse remake of a movie I've ever seen; but it plays well. Maybe the people I gave it to will enjoy it more than we did.,1416009600,,120,3.6538461538461537
5582212,4,B00BDZV8G6,"Very good play, great cast. Amidst see for the whole family.",1414713600,,60,4.545454545454546
5582213,5,B00BDZV8G6,"Had taped this from TV years ago, and inadvertently deleted. I like this version as well as the original movie version. Art Carney, Jean Stapleton and Harry Morgan are great. Was so happy to find it finally available on DVD.",1379721600,,224,4.625
5582214,2,B00BDZV8G6,"Fans of the MGM film with Lionel Barrymore, Jimmy Stewart, Edward Arnold, and Ann Miller, or the play itself, will be disappointed with this late 1970s television version.  The casting is all wrong (this was done by CBS not PBS) and serves mainly as a vehicle for Jean Stapleton, Mrs. Archie Bunker. Writers have twisted the story into a melodrama, and the humor barely exists.  Alas, this is a waste of time and money.",1365379200,11,419,4.648648648648648
5582215,3,B00BDZV8G6,"This remake of the original flick was OK, but not as good as the original.",1454544000,,74,4.0
5582216,4,B00BDZV8G6,"First, to all those reviewers who compare this to the 1938 movie, it is NOT an adaptation of the movie.  The movie was in fact an adaptation (and in my opinion a disastrously bad one) of the play.  The play was recorded twice to my knowledge.  The other one -- a taped performance in front of an audience in 1984 starring Jason Robards and Colleen Dewhurst with a runtime 20 minutes longer -- was more complete.  I prefer many of the casting choices in this one.  CBS ran this version originally in 1977.  It had to be pruned to fit into a 2-hour TV slot WITH commercials, but the agreement with the Kaufman estate stipulated that they could cut it for time, but they could NOT change (or move) any of the dialog.  So the cuts -- while annoying -- retained the flavor of the original.

This marvelous Pulitzer Prize winning play remains a classic for more reasons than will fit in this space.  I have seen many different productions of it over a lot of years.  Each brings to the audience nuances that no one else has achieved.  (In one production, Olga Katrina removes her fur coat at one point to reveal a waitress uniform underneath -- a great moment that I've seen nowhere else.)  Despite its brevity, this one has better chemistry than the Robards version (which is available on the Internet, but NOT as a DVD).  I've given each production 4 stars -- this one loses one star for the abridgement, the other loses one star for cast chemistry.  Watch them both to ""get"" the intent of the original script, written by two of the most brilliant playwrights to ever have created for the American theater.  I'm glad this one is now available as a DVD.  Now if someone would do the same for the Robards version....",1449532800,2,1710,4.467741935483871
5582217,5,B00BDZV8G6,"It's a great film. Great script. Won the Pulitzer Prize for Literature AND the Academy Award for Best Picture. That's only happened twice folks, very rare.
The plot seems sadly representative of today's America. The ending, at least it's intent, would be very welcome.",1440892800,,268,5.113636363636363
5582218,5,B00BDZV8G6,Saw it in black and white on TV.  Moving.  Ought to be required viewing for all crowds gathered for commencement ceremonies.,1435363200,,124,4.857142857142857
5582219,5,B00BDZV8G6,"This is the absolutely best adaptation of the play I've ever seen. I've had the play itself in hardcover (don't know where it is now) for over 50 years, and have loved it for that long. This is the only version I've ever seen that was completely true to the stage play (all the dialogue, etc.) There was a pretty good version with Jason Robards years ago, but they added some dialogue to that one. This is perfect. No missing scenes. Dialogue true to the original. Perfect casting. Who better than Jean Stapleton could have ever played Penny? Blythe Danner has been one of my favorite actresses since 1776 (the show, not the year).",1430092800,3,631,4.543859649122807
5582220,1,B00BDZV8G6,i so much wanted the dvd w Jimmy Stewart but settled for this one.  disappointing at best.,1428710400,,90,4.294117647058823
5582221,5,B00BDZV8G6,Watched this the other night and it is really a classic!  Beautifcally acted and hysterical,1425859200,,91,5.066666666666666
5582222,3,B00BDZV8G6,"We were disappointed in this DVD. Probably my fault for not getting the original. Make sure you order the original, this was a remake for TV.",1425081600,,141,4.461538461538462
5582223,5,B00BDZV8G6,this way great - like play on broadway,1425081600,,38,3.875
5582224,4,B00BDZV8G6,"Hey, folks this ISN'T a ""remake"" of a movie; it's the original Broadway play from which the familiar movie was adapted.  There's nothing in the play about armaments manufacturing or all that Capra sentimentality.  The play is fantastic and stands on its own merits; has plenty to say about America in the 30s.  The movie adaptation had to please the censors, remember.  I bought this because I remember how great Art Carney was as Grandpa Sycamore.  This production is great.",1423958400,3,475,4.8875
8566882,3,B00BDZV8G6,"A TERRIBLE FATAL FLAW... I realized why the trailer looks so lifeless. THERE'S NO AUDIENCE! Where are the laughs? Where is the life? This does not seem to be recorded live on a stage with an audience, but on a studio stage with everyone on set is like the dead. How can the actors get feedback? Where are the punchlines? Where is the timing? You just don't have the other half of a play without the live audience, it is the fuel that ignites the engine of the play, the lines and the actors and the clever choices they've made in delivering them and staging them with their business. Unless someone has some information to the contrary (please speak up if you own this video and have heard the live audience!) I'll stand on this.

These would have and should have been quite entertaining performances by very good actors. I just can't imagine why the producers appear (best as I can tell) to have decided to produce this recording of a dead performance.

If you are an actor looking to understand how to better exploit your scenes in this play, this video may give you a lot of terrific material. Just know in advance, if it feels a little dead, it's because the audience is missing.",1518220800,,1183,4.472222222222222
8566883,3,B00BDZV8G6,"I love this play but I felt the lines were rushed and there was a lack of proper pausing and comedic timing like in the PBS Great Expectation version which is impossible to find.  I feel like the actors were sick of the play and just wanted ro get it over with and it showed.

Going to try and watch the other movie version available to see how it is.",1504915200,,351,4.0
8566884,3,B00BDZV8G6,I've always loved this play.  This particular version isn't quite as good as others (I prefer the one with Jason Robards) but it is still good.,1481587200,,143,4.5
8566885,5,B00BDZV8G6,A great cast in this very funny television remake of a classic.  My 18 year old grandson loved it.  Why can't they make movies like this anymore?,1477526400,,145,4.333333333333333
8566886,5,B00BDZV8G6,"Absolutely delightful, from start to finish: the characterizations, the timing, blocking.  One felt truly a part of Grandpa's family.  Art Carney is the perfect Grandpa: sweet, wise, guileless, full of life.  I'm glad to have bought it, since I intended to watch it again...and again.  I am playing Kolenkhov in a reading of the play, and Kenneth Mars' performance has provided many tips as to accent and bravado.",1477267200,2,413,5.029411764705882
8566887,4,B00BDZV8G6,"If you've never seen the original with Jean Arthur,  James Stewart, Lionel Barrymore, and a cast of famous people, then you will enjoy this remake much more.  Art Carney is great but he doesn't match Lionel Barrymore. The storyline is a bit different which was OK.  On the whole, I'm glad I bought both the original and the remake.",1466467200,2,331,4.576271186440678
8566888,2,B00BDZV8G6,"I do agree with Mr. B. C. Arthur: his review fits with mine: this is a really total disappointment (with only a very few nice moments). Jean Stapleton is good, not excellent, and all the other players probably obey to a sad director. The requested candor is far away - all seems  no, all is false. I happen to have a video with a 1984 Broadway production of the same delightful play by Kaufman & Hart where YOU CANT TAKE IT WITH YOU works alla grande, always on the up-and-up, a sheer delight. Skookum, to say a word that might be congenial to the family in question (I have chosen that word, but I am an Italian and maybe I might be inaccurate  ). Jason Robards  & friends - in this Broadway performance - amused myself very much because fun looked natural and alive. Archive WB Collection would have done better by selecting  this version instead of one they had better to forget.
The film with dear Jimmy Stewart is  another story belonging to a time when the cinema fortunately offered happy hours of entertainment with glorious direction as well as a lot of incomparable players.
