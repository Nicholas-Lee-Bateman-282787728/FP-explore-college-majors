2048020,5,B0001ZX0HO,"This brought many great memories of childhood.  I grew up here in the country where we were not offered cable until the past few years we didn't have it.  On Saturday nights we would gather around the television and enjoy Buck, Roy, Junior Samples, Grandpa Jones, Minnie Pearl, Ganala Hutton and the rest with their guest stars.  I hope very much they will be releasing more.",1085356800,3,375,4.651515151515151

Hee Haw Ranked in the Top 20 Nationwide in 1971. You will Love this Premiere Episode if you are a Fan of Hee Haw and Country Music like me, I love the Old Style of Country Music with the Original Instruments, nothing like today, most Artists don't even use the Steel Guitar any more which by the way it goes back to 1922 and earlier. The Hee Haw Collection is part of American Musical History and I Love Collecting all the Epidodes! .. Thank You D.D.",1354838400,2,1994,4.5790960451977405

2048110,2,B0001ZX0HO,I was sorry I purchased this for my dad. It is off color and inappropriate in our book. I remembered it differently from childhood.,1261353600,,131,4.5
2048161,5,B0001ZX0HO,This collection helped in the production of a play based on the TV series and it was a great success.,1253577600,,101,4.1
2048162,5,B0001ZX0HO,"I ordered this DVD after my granny saw a infomercial for the DVD collection of Hee Haw.  Man, I love that show!  It is one of the few chances you get to see all the older country music singers (that actually sing country music and not country-rock).  I just wish Time Life would put EVERY EPISODE on DVD!",1223424000,,304,4.206896551724138
2048163,1,B0001ZX0HO,"Praise the lord, it's dead and gone.  Put a stake thruough its heart and scatter the ashes and let no child ever have to sit thru two hours on a Saturday night of this infernally painfully awful show.  Still gives me the shivers.  ""Heh, maybe we'll have some new jokes next week.""  Maybe not.  Hell is actors telling jokes that are charitably called corn-ball in a fake cornfield week after week after week.  I used to pray that someone got 'is goldurn foot caught in a thresher.",1197849600,3,479,4.448275862068965
2048164,3,B0001ZX0HO,"Sorry to disagree with William, but I remember being annoyed with them replacing Smothers Brothers with Hee Haw, and being pleasantly surprised at how good it was.  Perhaps what he's remembering is a time slot difference in his area?  I don't have the DVDs yet, so I can't speak to the quality of them, though I have no reason to doubt the other reviewers on that issue...",1096934400,2,372,4.537313432835821
2048165,2,B0001ZX0HO,"It's wonderful to have the opportunity to acquire this show on DVD. The jokes are still as corny as ever, the music still as good as ever, and Junior's delivery still cracks me up.

The sad thing is, Time-Life is the company putting out the DVD's. This initial DVD is a poor value. One show and one highlight reel is all that is provided. Add to that the fact that the highlight reel includes numerous out-takes from the same premiere show included, and you're paying full price for basically one show.

Also, Time-Life has obviously not seen fit to restore any of the footage. Colors bleed badly (which is extremely obvious on a show with loud sets, lighting, and clothing), and grain is everywhere.

Should you buy this DVD, or the subsequent releases? Well, I doubt this show will ever be released as it should have been....in full season sets. So if you want to have copies of this classic, this is probably your only choice. Just prepare yourself to have deep pockets and low expectations.",1093996800,100,994,4.636363636363637
2048166,5,B0001ZX0HO,"I am tickled pink to see that Hee Haw is back for us to see again.  I would never miss this when I was a kid.  Maybe our kids today will find it funny (or just look at us weird).  Now I am waiting for the Bewitched series to be put on DVD and my collection will be complete. Ahhh, the good ole' days.",1091577600,7,300,3.65625
2048167,5,B0001ZX0HO,"""Hee-Haw"" can best be described as a country version of ""Rowan and Martin's Laugh-in,"" with plenty of good music thrown into the mix.
Dropped into the CBS schedule in June 1969 as a summer replacement for ""The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour"" (not the ""Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour"" as indicated on the DVD cover--their show had come to an abrupt and controversial end several weeks earlier), ""Hee-Haw"" was to run a scant 13 weeks and then disappear forever...but Nielsen numbers attract attention, and the show was a ratings favorite throughout its summer '69 run...CBS returned it to the air at the earliest opportunity a few months later, and the rest is history (""Hee-Haw May Have the Last Laugh"" declared a TV Guide news brief in mid-summer '69, describing the show's unexpected ratings success and CBS' desire to continue with the program as soon as there was room on the schedule).
Though the show lasted many years, my favorite episodes remain those first 13--this DVD showcases the premiere episode, plus a compilation bonus called ""Hee-Haw Laffs,"" which first appeared on VHS tape several years ago.
""Hee-Haw"" was fast-paced, funnier than ""Rowan and Martin's Laugh in,"" and the musical breaks always featured top country talent showcased at their best.
Time-Life's presentation of the show is wonderful. Even the opening slate, featuring the scheduled broadcast date, is included, as is the brief Burma Shave inspired ""We'll be back in a minute"" station break blurb that was only a part of those first 13 episodes. I'm so grateful someone preserved these tapes--though some chroma noise is evident, quality is remarkably good overall.
This was such a welcome DVD discovery, and a mail order catalog received yesterday indicates that future volumes are forthcoming quickly! I hope so, as I'll be eagerly awaiting their arrival.",1088294400,17,1833,5.154362416107382
2048168,5,B0001ZX0HO,"This tune mentioned and the title as well as ""Gloom Despair and Agony on Me"" (not included in this DVD) will bring smiles to any child of the 70s who was too young to go out on Saturday night and watched this with your family. Yes, Jr. Samples, Grandpa Jones, Minnie Pearl and Buck & Roy are all back with good old fashioned country corn. This is the first episode from 1969 and the extras only feature some other gags that already exist in this same show. The show never changed that much over the next 20 odd years, which was part of its charm. Country music fans will also be pleased to see a young Loretta Lynn and Charley Pride (singing ""Kaw Liga"") along for the ride, although neither of them interact with the Kornfield Kounty gang as later guests would.
People who did not see this the first time around may not ""get it"" or be amused at all. Your kids in particular may look at you like idiots while you laugh and smile at this. But if you remember this at all, you'll join in with the Kornfield Kounty Krew as they sing HEE HEE HEE HAW HAW HAW HEE HAW without worrying about what anyone else thinks!",1086739200,9,1108,4.2559241706161135
2048169,5,B0001ZX0HO,"after years of hoping someone would issue classic full-length Hee-Haw shows on video or either DVD, i was thrilled when Time-Life realized the demand that the show has built, really since the last show in 1992, all of us Hee-Haw fans at some point or another have made our desires of having the show's released on video/DVD. This DVD contains the first episode from 1969 with Loretta Lynn and Charley Pride. It also contains the famed ""Hee-Haw Laffs"" from 1996 as a bonus. Since it's the debut episode, the show is comprised of the same routines throughout the hour because that's all they had at the time. Minnie Pearl and Sheb Wooley make guest appearances. Sheb does his Ben Colder character, singing a parody of ""Hello Walls"". The Hager Twins perform. The show's opening didn't contain the signature cast credit, though. This cast run-down happened at the end of the show. Clearly, the stand-outs for me are anything with Archie Campbell, Gordie Tapp, Grandpa Jones, Don Harron, and Junior Samples. Loretta sings ""Your Squaw Is On The Warpath"" while Charley sings ""I Can't Help It"" and ""Kaw-Liga"". Grandpa Jones does a wild, bopping banjo song! The character actor, Pat McComick, famous as being ""Enos"" on the Smokey and the Bandit movies, appears in the silent sketches which all start with an out-house falling over!! Pat, in one silent sketch, is dressed as Superman who trips and falls down a hill! Then, on Buck's song, ""Who's Gonna Mow Your Grass?"", the program shifts to a bunch of people out in a field mowing grass in what could be one of the first country music videos! Don Harron's KORN news-anchor ""Charlie Farqueson"" was as hilarious and the master of mangling words on the debut as he became over the course of the next 17 years he was part of the show {1969-1986}. Once again, because it was the first episode, not many sketches had been created and so you'll see ""The Moonshiners"", ""The Culhanes"", ""Pffft! You Was Gone!"", ""The Haystack"", and the trademark ""Kornfield Jokes"" over and over in between the singing. Archie's barbershop appeared, by the way. Archie and Roy do a routine called ""That's Good-That's Bad"". All in all, a wonderful DVD and one that'll cause Hee-Haw fans to clamor for more and more and more and...you get the point!!",1086307200,39,2260,4.797435897435897
2048170,5,B0001ZX0HO,"Hee Haw was one of those shows that presented us with a lot of laughs and a lot of good music despite it's tendencies to appear corny. Every Saturday night at 6 PM it would come on.  My dad and I would come in from cutting wood all day.  He would start a roaring fire in the fireplace.  Mom would have a huge pot of homemade stew and hot cocoa waiting for us.  Then, we would all go downstairs to the family room, sit before the snap, crackling fire and watch Hee Haw.  Those are special times.  I miss them.  I sincerely hope they bring Hee Haw back to us on DVD.",1086134400,7,564,3.982142857142857
8019144,3,B0001ZX0HO,The highlight for me is Charley Pride singing Kaw-Liga.  It is Hee Haw and I could watch it and then turn around and watch it again.,1493596800,,132,4.076923076923077

8019148,4,B0001ZX0HO,"""Creepy and Unsmart"" said my 8-year-old son when we watched the Premier episode. My husband and I cracked up at his ""review."" My son could see how corny and dumb the jokes were, which is part of the charm of this show. The first episode had some great artists and music--Loretta Lynn and Charley Pride for starters. My husband loves country music and he loves this show. I'm not a fan of country music, but the music was excellent in this show. The jokes are so dumb, they're funny! Even my son laughed at the barber shop scenes and ""PFFT You Were Gone"" clips. This show patterned themselves after Laugh-In (remember that??), and it developed such a following that it outlasted Laugh-In by 19 seasons. Hee Haw was on for 25 seasons, Laugh-In only for 6.

If you can get your hands on the DVDs, you're in for a treat, but I'm minusing one star because Time-Life DVDs only have 1-2 episodes on them; more could have easily been included on one DVD. Too bad somebody else can't get the rights from Time-Life so a special set of all 25 seasons could be released.",1434412800,,1058,4.453608247422681
