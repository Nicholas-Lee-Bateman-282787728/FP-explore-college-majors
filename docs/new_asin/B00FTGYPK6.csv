6031383,5,B00FTGYPK6,"Amazing! I had the opportunity to see this show live, and when I first saw this DVD i complained about the camera changing angles so fast to the point of making me sick...but the more i watch it the more I love it...so that first impression was not really and objective one, whether you are a fan or only like her music I'm sure you are gonna love it...not many artists now days put on a show like this one.",1411862400,,407,4.1

6031387,3,B00FTGYPK6,I enjoy Pink. The lip synching was a bit annoying and a lot of covers. - Enjoyable non the less.,1410134400,,96,3.85
6031388,5,B00FTGYPK6,This was a gift for my daughter who collects all of Pink's dvds. She had talked about it. She will get it for her birthday on Dec.  Very pleased with my purchase.,1409961600,,162,4.0625
6031389,5,B00FTGYPK6,"Wow talk about surprised!! I caught this concert on the Epix channel and was blown away by the way Pink does her aerial acrobatics and then her dance/stunts on stage. I turned around and bought this on BD and glad I did.  Everytime I watch it the concert is full of energy it re-energized myself and just made me feel good.  Very enjoyable concert.  I did have 1 complaint which isn't a big deal, there was one song where they edited it in black & white and the filming didn't really capture what was happening on stage much, it lost the feeling of a concert.  Other then that It was one of the best concert video I have seen in a long time!",1408924800,,641,4.186991869918699

6031394,5,B00FTGYPK6,I had seen this tour here in the states and I absolutely LOVED IT!! Of course it isn't exactly the same show that I had seen and I am sure that is due to the editing but it is the closest I can get to reliving THE BEST CONCERT I have ever been to!!! P!nk is an amazing artist and performer and I most definitely recommend this Blu-ray!!,1405468800,2,336,3.9558823529411766

6031402,5,B00FTGYPK6,"We were lucky enough to see PINK: The Truth About Love Tour when she came to San Jose and it was the best, most fun and awesome concert I have seen since The Eagles: When Hell Freezes Over Tour.  The DVD is great, the picture and sound quality are amazing, I just wish there were some special features included like interviews and more behind the scenes footage.  The credits shows the same behind the scenes footage they showed on the JumboTron at the end of the Live show which is good I was just hoping for some special features on the DVD.

Still a great concert DVD whether you want to relive the LIVE show or are watching it for the first time.",1402012800,,650,4.2682926829268295
6031403,5,B00FTGYPK6,"P!nk does not disappoint when she goes on tour. This was simply an amazing night of pure entertainment. I was lucky and got to see the show twice while the tour was going. And true, there is some funky editing on this concert blu-ray, but it takes me right back to the shows to watch it. So it is worth every cent. Can't wait to see what she does next!",1401408000,,352,4.042857142857143
6031404,5,B00FTGYPK6,"I love this concert! Pink has many talents, she has a beautiful voice and she knows how to entertain her fans!",1401408000,,110,4.285714285714286
6031405,3,B00FTGYPK6,"My wife and I love pink, and we were actually at the first show of this tour as my valentine gift to her.  Fantastic show, we loved it!  So, not being one to pass up a good ""bonus points with the wife"" opportunity, I got her this as a gift.  The music is great, of course, but I want to strangle the editor and/or director.

Would all concert video editors/directors please, please, PLEASE realize that this is about the music, the show, and the artist--not YOUR ""artistic vision"" of the concert!  Show the show that is going on.  ""Improve"" on it only by giving angles and viewing ranges that most of the audience doesn't get to see.  If there is a fun/interesting (/important?) AV element going on, that the audience there gets to see, SHOW IT.  (The stage backdrop graphics for ""How Come You're Not Here"" are a riot and put a completely different spin on the song.  There are some sections in a few others songs where the graphics are great as well...and none of it is in this video!)

Then it gets worse.  After NOT showing the things that are part of the show, the editor and/or director decide to get ""creative"" by using slo-mo strobe/afterimage effects.  Of course, this immediately causes what you are seeing on the screen to not match up with the audio you are hearing...and then there is a jarring cut back to what is actually happening...and who knows what went on in the part you missed?  This effect does nothing to add to the show (in fact, it detracts from it).  And they do it more than once.

Then there's the fact that this was edited in the style of Michael Bay (badly), with quick, choppy cuts from camera to camera for no real reason other than the editor and/or director needed to feel like they were doing something every couple of seconds.  There is an amazing stage show going on--your job is to show that, not show that you know now to switch from camera A to C to F to B to E within 10 seconds, just because you can!

I'm not someone who spouts that the Talking Heads ""Stop making sense"" is the only good concert video ever made, but really, its one of the best because it lets you ENJOY THE SHOW THE ARTIST HAS PUT TOGETHER, AS IT WAS PUT TOGETHER.

With the show pink puts on, its really a shame the video of it was handled by these hacks.

5 stars for the concert.
0 stars for the editing.
So 3 stars overall, because I can't do a 2.5 stars.",1400716800,22,2370,4.309255079006772
6031406,5,B00FTGYPK6,"Bought the DVD after watching the program on Amazon Prime.  My husband then watched it, loved it, my friends have watched it and like it alot.",1400457600,,142,4.461538461538462
6031407,1,B00FTGYPK6,"Why are all of her shows filmed in Australia, or Europe?  Doesn't she want Americans to have jobs?  She must think Obama is the Messiah.",1400198400,,136,4.4

6031409,4,B00FTGYPK6,Pink always deliver.  The only reason I gave her 4 stars is because personally I don't like concerts were there is too much talking.,1399852800,,132,4.5
6031410,5,B00FTGYPK6,"I own her other blu ray release of Funhouse Tour Down under, so I knew going into this that as long as I like the album that the show would not disappoint. I own the fan release version of this album and that was a totally solid album. Though you get 7 ""bonus"" songs it's not like they are throwaways or rough versions, they were great songs. And this show is great as well. Although the guy who came out between some of the songs was a bit annoying, the parts showcasing Pink were not to be missed. she usually throws in a song or two that she covers (previously she did Crazy and Bohemian Rhapsody (by Gnarls Barkley and Queen respectively) and she really impressed me. Most artists may sound great singing their own songs but usually they fall a bit flat with covers. The show was very physical and had some trapeze/wire work, but that didn't detract from the vocals (take that Britney Spears). Pink is a true artist and doesn't disappoint. I'm looking forward to her next show/album eagerly. I missed her this past year due to being in the hospital. I'll definitely catch her in person next time around. The bonus material is a bit silly. it has more of the annoying clown guy and a redneck version of ""Slut Like You"" but the main reason to buy is for the actual show, which is top notch. It's great to see live performers not lip synching. if there is any pre-recorded parts it has to do with the background vocals (as on the album she does the background as well) and additional sounds/voices, but the main vocal is live. Anyone who is a fan of rock concerts or just well done concerts should pick this up. her vocals are strong even though the physical demands are great. You'd never know she recently had a child. A DEFINITE must-have",1399248000,,1742,4.413043478260869
6031411,5,B00FTGYPK6,Great entertainment. Pink is definitely a dynamic entertainer and just fantastic..... I'd recommend this Blu-Ray to anyone. Go for it.,1398211200,,134,5.75
6031412,2,B00FTGYPK6,"Unlike Pink's Funhouse concert, also recorded in Melbourne, this one has been turned into a marginal experience by an utterly pointless effort to mimic music video jump-cuts during much of the concert. This is completely inappropriate for the experience of a virtual concert and becomes annoying easily and often. The worst is the first third of the BD. Apparently the director and editor became tired of the effort needed to splice together so many cuts, many lasting a few seconds at most. In the hands of a competent director who understands that a 148-minute concert is not a music video, this would have been a far more enjoyable experience. I gave it two stars instead of one only because it's not as obnoxious as the ber-jump-cut Pink Live In Europe DVD from 2004.",1398038400,,771,4.804511278195489
6031413,5,B00FTGYPK6,This is by far her best album and the blu ray of the concert is just great. P!nk just keeps getting better and you won't be disappointed by the video. There some extras and the end credit videos are pretty cool. If you like P!nk you can't go wrong with this.,1397692800,,258,4.078431372549019

Most of the DVD was ok for her to watch. I sat with her and skipped over the parts that were a little too mature for her.

6031423,4,B00FTGYPK6,"Better picture than the Funhouse tour Blu-ray.  Much less grain and great contrast.  A fair amount of overlap with the Funhouse set list but does include some essential newer songs/hits.  The MC is a bit irritating during some of the lengthier costume change interludes.  Some of the ""patter"" not suitable fo rthe youngest ones...but then PINK in general is probably for a more mature audience.",1395878400,,394,5.015384615384615

6031461,5,B00FTGYPK6,"I had tickets to go to P!nk's show in Kansas City back in November but moved to the West coast before the concert. I was disappointed that I didn't get to see her live but this Blu-ray disc is a pretty amazing substitute. This movie puts you in the front row of her high-octane show.

P!nk's vocals tend to be overlooked by many people but she demonstrates in this show that she can hit the high notes better than her peers, all while doing flips 30 feet up in the air. This 90-plus minute show takes you through all the stages of love. She performs a number of songs from her recent hit album and throws in several fan favorites from throughout her career.

My favorite part of the concert is when she performs a stripped-down acoustic set halfway through the show. You can hear the grit and agony in her voice. P!nk interacts with the crowd several times and you can tell she genuinely appreciates her fans. It always amazes me how she can one-up herself each tour. She always finds a way to thoroughly entertain the audience, all while putting her safety (seemingly) on the back burner. There aren't many entertainers out there who will strap themselves in a harness and fly over the audience, or be catapulted vertically from the stage.

I highly recommend this Blu-ray to any of P!nk's fans, past or present.",1391040000,2,1313,4.531645569620253
6031462,5,B00FTGYPK6,"Let me start by saying, my wife and I own over 20 Blu-ray concerts. Every time we get a new concert, we watch it over and over and some of those include ""Lady GaGa MB, Sade, Adele, Amy Winehouse and John Mayer"".  We got this Pink: The Truth About Love Tour Blu-ray from Amazon and have watched the complete concert 3 days in a row.  All i can say is Wow, it's hard to pick a stand out performance because the entire Blu-ray is mind blowing.  There is so much going on at one time, you actually get lost trying to see everything.  Before I saw this concert, I liked a few of Pink's song, but never imagined the level of talent this lady has.  The Video quality was awesome, the Audio ""True Dolby HD"" rocked from beginning to end.  Every aspect of this concert is nothing short of stunning, from the acrobatics, the high energy band, the amazing dancers to the crazy cool stage.  My wife and I joke about which of our Blu-ray concert collection sits atop the mountain, well I can say with a great deal of certainty, this concert is alone at the top and a must own for any Pink fan, or a fan of great musical performances. I will give you a few titles we marveled over ""Just Like A Pill, Train Wreck, Sober, Blow One Last Kiss and Slut Like Me"".  Just ordered the Pink: Funhouse Blu-ray and can't wait to see more of this rare talent.",1390694400,19,1331,4.21259842519685
6031463,2,B00FTGYPK6,"I was so excited to buy P!nks Truth About Love concert DVD. In part because she puts on a great show and in part because I recently saw that particular concert at the Staples Center with some good friends. So, I was a bit curious when I saw she had a bluegrass version of Slut Like You. Nothing could have prepared me for the level of offensive disrespect I saw in that video. It was disgusting and totally failed at being funny.

In the video, it showed funny caricatures of hillbillies. Among them were her band and dancers with blacked-out teeth, women were pregnant and drinking beer some of them seeming underage. They were yucking it up in every offensive way imaginable. The only thing missing was obvious incest.

I just cannot understand how mocking hillbillies is any different than dressing as queens and mocking the LGBT community, or mocking any other whole group of people. Or maybe someone can explain how this is different than if they had all put on black face and mocked African Americans?

Maybe it is because we collectively think we are smarter than hillbillies and therefore they deserve to be mocked.

No group of people DESERVE to be mocked. Let me just say that I am a fairly liberal progressive and I do not watch Duck Dynasty or Honey Boo Boo, I do not know any hillbillies or red necks but I would like to think that am mature enough to treat them with human dignity, as I would any other group being attacked unfairly.

Of course this seems to be her attitude toward people who believe tolerance should be for everyone and not just a pet group of people.

This is depressing coming from someone like P!NK who gives lip service to tolerance and love toward others. There is a reason that I usually avoid learning personal beliefs or values of my favorite entertainers. I do not watch TMZ or read most interviews so that I can continue to enjoy their work. This is why. It was sad for me to learn that P!NK is klassy with a k.",1390521600,2,1953,4.47191011235955
6031464,5,B00FTGYPK6,The blu-ray brought back the sights and sounds of seeing Pink live (except the scratchy voice) in Seattle.  She is definitely an artist worth seeing.  We also saw things that we couldn't see from our seats.  The only disappointment was that Glitter wasn't included.  That was the final encore for our concert.  Practice for it was shown in the documentary but not the concert.  The blu-ray is still worth having.,1390435200,6,412,4.814285714285714
6031465,5,B00FTGYPK6,"Got the blu ray in the mail today, and the quality is amazing.  Made me feel like I was at the concert all over again.  I went to 2 shows on The Truth About Love tour and was completely blown away.  The blu ray does a good job of reliving the show, but the cameras are all over the place, and it jumps from one frame to another constantly.  It does not focus on P!nk for very long. However, it was an extremely energetic performance, so I suppose it's fitting for the blu ray to be all over the place.  I simply cannot give this less than 5 stars because it gave me goosebumps.... put on the surround sound, and it was a dance party in my living room. P!nk in second to none, and there is no one out there who can put on a show half as good as she can.  She's the best!!! Love you Alecia!!!!",1390435200,6,791,3.943396226415094
6031466,5,B00FTGYPK6,Madonna who?  Pink's got the real moves and the voice to back it up. Amazing acrobatics by the new mom setting the bar higher for what is expected by a pop star in live performance. She wins; the others lose!,1390435200,4,208,4.2
6031467,5,B00FTGYPK6,"I've watched the 'Funhouse Tour' prior concert bluray many times since it was released, so I was looking forward to this new one; it's high-quality and P!nk delivers another excellent show.  Lots of energy and vocal quality onstage, combined with an enthusiastic audience makes for another strong show.

I like P!nks range and onstage 'edge', she brings a good variety of vocal styles to the setlist this time up, and her band and b/g vocalists are in top form, too.  Rocking it as usual, this is a high-energy concert, clear visuals and audio quality make it another one I'll watch many times.

The behind-the-scenes tour bonus video is very good, too -- enjoyed the insights from how the band works together, P!nk's family, and more.  Very good show, thanks for bringing it!

6031468,5,B00FTGYPK6,"Been a fan since she started out in Philly...

I don't like putting a label on her but to me she still ""rocks out!""!

This is a performance make no mistake about it....The Band (one of my all time faves) are about the best musicians one could possibly assemble....

The mix, audio and video are phenomenal....

While the Setlist is always more personal .... I would have preferred a few more rockin oldies to mix it up a little or perhaps put out a full 2 hour show....

This is pure Entertainment..... enjoy solo w/ your wine, your hottie, or your kid!  about as good a performance could possibly get!

This disc is amazing in terms of the video and performance.  It still carries a ton of audiophile weight behind it compared to most concert discs.  If your a fan of amazing talent both musically and athletically I would highly recommend this disc.  I would consider it a must have for any pink fan and strongly encourage anyone to own it for the pure amazing talent displayed in it.,1390089600,5,519,4.375
6031472,5,B00FTGYPK6,Being a p! nk fan from day one I absolutely love her live shows. Not only is her music wonderful  her shows bring the songs to life! She surpasses all other female pop stars when it comes to touring and performing live (I've seen quite a few shows to compare her shows to)  I look  forward to relieving this show at home!  The truth about love tour has so  many  great songs.  Was disappointed she didn't perform the title track but with a song collection like hers it's ok to not do it. My personal favorite performances in this tour were 'try' and 'sober' not just for the performance side but for pink's ability to belt out solid notes night after night.,1390089600,,657,4.336065573770492
