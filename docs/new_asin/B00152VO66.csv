8257205,3,B00152VO66,"I found this to be a good basic tutorial.  It will give you the tools needed to get started using Studio.  I was looking for something a bit more advanced and in depth, so it wasn't very helpful to me.  I did learn a few tips and tricks, so I'm giving it 3 stars.",1215475200,,263,3.8333333333333335
