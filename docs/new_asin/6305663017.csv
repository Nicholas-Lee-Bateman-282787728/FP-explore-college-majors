7892704,5,6305663017,"You are some pathetic loser. Don't you have anything better to do with your time than attempt to be amusing with your lame disparaging comments about Bob Hope? Who happens to be an absolute legend and one of the greatest comedians of the past century. But of course I wouldn't expect someone of your caliber to grasp that....it's simply over your head. Go watch some Brady Bunch reruns and stay off of Amazon.com.....

To all of you folks who are looking for a fun look at Bob Hope and his family at the Holidays check out this super video and please disregard the first review listed.

I highly recommend it~",1153785600,,609,4.527272727272727
