8138948,5,B000HDR8CS,"I recently discovered these ""Pokemon 10th Anniversary"" DVD's.

All three of our children absolutely love Pokemon. Their ages/genders are 8 boy, 4 girl, and 3 girl.

I really try to buy them other things besides toys because they have so many toys. So books and DVDs are my go to when it comes to birthdays, Christmas and Easter.

They were SO excited to open these on their birthday. My 8 and 3 year olds have a birthday a week apart so I bought several of these DVD's for them. I love the cover art on this DVD and it's neat that they have DVD's for many of the characters because our kids do have their favorite Pokemon characters.

I think these DVD's come at a great price as well. I will definitely be buying more especially with Christmas coming up soon.",1475884800,,760,4.368794326241135

8138950,5,B000HDR8CS,"This DVD contains 3 really fun episodes from different seasons that all feature Eevee. In ""The Battling Eevee Brothers"" (Episode #38 in Season 1: Indigo League) a young boy with an Eevee must stand up for himself and tell his 3 older brothers that he does not want to follow their example and evolve his Eevee. Instead he wants to train his Eevee in it's unevolved form and be an Eevee trainer. In the second episode ""The Rivalry Revival"" (Episode #36 in Season 2: The Adventures In The Orange Islands) Ash and Pikachu battle with Gary and his Eevee to settle who is the better trainer. The third episode on the disc is ""Trouble's Brewing"" (Episode #26 in Season 4: Johto League Champions) and revolves around a group of sisters who all train with a different form of Eevee. The youngest sister and Misty bond right away because of shared feelings regarding being the youngest in a large family of girls. All three episodes on this disc are a lot of fun and great for any Eevee fan.

8138951,5,B000HDR8CS,this is a great collection of evee episodes it is fun and enjoyable to watch. if you have not seen this dvd then I recommend you do,1457049600,,131,3.888888888888889
8138952,5,B000HDR8CS,Great movie at a good price. My daughter really enjoys these pokemon' dvds Very pleased.,1440806400,,88,4.933333333333334
8138953,3,B000HDR8CS,"This DVD is what it says: Three episodes of Pokemon featuring an Eevee. The three episodes are not connected, but anyone with a breif knowledge of Pokemon will be able to follow along with each story. The episodes are decent, but only two actually star an Eevee. The other is just a brief battle with one and then the episode continues and has no relation to Eevee later on.

However this DVD was not that good. When you put this DVD into your player, the usual FBI warning shows and then episodes just start playing. You are not presented with the menu first. You can always use your remote to bring you to the menu if desired. While at the menu, you'll have quick access to any of the three episodes. There are NO bonus features to this disc. For what it's worth, it just felt like someone threw some episodes on a disc and sold them. No real effort is put into this disc. I can only assume the other DVDs in the Pokemon 10th Anniversary line are like this, and if so, I find no reason to purchase them.

If you are wanting a quick fix for your Pokemon anime craving, this will do the trick. If you are wanting to fully enjoy the show all over again, I'd suggest buying the season box sets and avoiding the 10th Anniversary DVDs.",1360368000,5,1231,4.278969957081545
