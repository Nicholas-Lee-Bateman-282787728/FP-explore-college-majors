8673342,5,B00MNT5PUG,"As I become more familiar with director Germi, I become more appreciative.  My first impression was that Divorce Italian Style was his only significant film, but that has changed for me as I look forward to seeing his films more and more.  The biting social satire that marks his films is perhaps never more fully expressed than in The Birds, The Bees, & The Italians.  Also, I was not sure, at first, about the idea of several separate episodes in one movie. But it is the use of the episodes, that is Germi's master stroke.  Threads run through each episode and each episode builds upon the absurdities of episodes that may have gone before, until the movie ultimately builds to a laughable crescendo.  A true work of genius and a worthwhile viewing experience.",1425945600,4,763,4.706766917293233
8673343,5,B00MNT5PUG,My father had the soundtrack for this film back in the 60's and I always thought the music was so catchy and fun to listen to.  The movie won the Cannes Film Festival in 1966 but has never been available until just recently (been searching for years).  It made a great Christmas surprise gift for my dad who has been looking for the film for years.  There are subtitles but the film is easy to watch and the characters are quirky and interesting.,1422921600,4,446,4.349397590361446
