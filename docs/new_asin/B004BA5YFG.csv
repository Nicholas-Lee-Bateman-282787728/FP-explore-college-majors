4314801,1,B004BA5YFG,The visual quality of this is so poor that it is unwatchable. Amazon should take this off their list of offerings. Even for $2.00 it is not worth watching.,1384041600,2,155,4.379310344827586
4314802,3,B004BA5YFG,For when it was produced not bad. For today's standards it wouldn't be reviewed very well.  I wouldn't buy it but for the instant viewing it's alright,1378771200,3,150,4.555555555555555

4314805,1,B004BA5YFG,Not much more to ad.  The quality was too bad to continue watching the whole thing.  In the old days of low def TV this might have appeared fine but in today's High Def this just could not past video quality muster.  I tried to watch it but had to give up.,1364515200,,256,3.8846153846153846
4314806,5,B004BA5YFG,From the start you have to remember history may differ from the storie on the news. On the news all the intent was to support reasons that we wanted to believe and then our Heros returned.,1364256000,,188,4.25
4314807,4,B004BA5YFG,It gives you a real look at how Vietnam really was back then and not many movies or docs do that,1361664000,13,96,3.619047619047619

4314821,4,B004BA5YFG,"It's a typical 60's documentary on why we should be in Vietnam and an admiring look at the military. Great footage of Vietnam. Reminds me of the evening news at the time, without Walter Cronkite.",1457740800,2,195,4.6

4314841,2,B004BA5YFG,"As a USMC veteran of 23 months in Vietnam, I found this to be a bogus depiction of what was happening in Vietnam at the time.  It was one sided and failed to tell the story.  It showed the US wining the conflict and assured everyone of our eventual victory.  Far too much reporting by US forces was exaggerations and outright lies.  This film is full of willful blindness.",1434931200,,372,4.3478260869565215

4314843,5,B004BA5YFG,"Those who bag on this film don't understand what they are looking at. This is a US Army training film, most likely used to indoctrinate those soldiers who just arrived in country. The film is accurate and excellent, even though it was a bit out of focus. Someone called this film a whitewash. That person has no idea of why we were there and what we did. People should know about this war before they condemn it.",1430265600,7,412,4.363636363636363

4314860,2,B004BA5YFG,"First, this is a very low quality digital transfer of an old 16mm film.  I suspect that someone with an 8mm camera was copying it in the back of the tent and that copy made this video.  I saw the original a very long time ago.  Please be sure to recognize that this is a propaganda film produced by the US Army.  Most of what is stated in this is just not accurate and much of it could be challenged as a lie.  It was made to get high school students to answer a call to combat and not burn their draft cards or high tail it to Canada.",1400025600,2,535,3.871559633027523

4314864,3,B004BA5YFG,Maybe it's coming from hindsight but this film is typical Army PR BS. It makes everything sound so wonderful and our guys were so happy to be a part of it all. I agree units have their pride and rightfully so but this was just a bit much to swallow.,1391990400,7,249,4.0
4314865,1,B004BA5YFG,"These were boring when I had to watch them in the military and even worse when I am no longer in the military and required to see it.  Plus, this training film is from the 60s",1391385600,,175,3.861111111111111
4314866,2,B004BA5YFG,"Very poor quality film - so bad that even on close up filming it is so out of focus or ""fuzzy"" that nothing is clear.  Don't know, maybe a case of jungle rot got into the film canister.  Regardless, I could only watch about 5 minutes before giving up.",1389830400,,251,4.1020408163265305
