Considering how large the Postal service is, how it is found in every community across our nation, it amazes me that no film makers seem to have a clue as to what goes on there.  There is plenty of real life insanity going on at the Post Office , why make it even more unbelievable?  Normally film makers go to a lot of effort to make their works seem believable.  Here they went the opposite direction.  I just can't find a way to describe this movie without resorting to language I haven't used since grade school, so I just won't bother.",1194048000,,609,4.307017543859649

Some of the classics are Orens' Paranoia to the point he has to record daily occurances on his route. The Postmaster offering the office screw-ups promotions. The utterly dead on spoof of Postal on-the-job-training videos. Add to this some funny sight gags. And you get a quite entertaining movie. I happened to see this on HBO and recorded it and passed it around my small office, the other carriers loved it. The supervisor that watched it mysteriously found it ""not funny"". That just adds to its charm. Some of the humor is crass, and you really have to suspend your disbelief. But just enjoy it for what it is and youll have a laugh.",1006560000,4,772,4.4822695035460995

The fact that all the characters gave the sense that ""something was missing from their  cranium"" is what leads you to stay intrigued until the conclusion,  which to some may seem predictable.  But what's facinating, is seeing the  factors that derive from soley one person (not Oren) that lead to the  conclusion.  After speaking to the director J.J., it was more than  rewarding to learn the history and derivation of the movie.  This movie is  definitely one of my favorites, along with Clockwatchers, One Flew Over the  Cuckoo's Nest, Tank Girl, and possibly Clockwork Orange(I still haven't  decided what I think about and if I even like that one yet...those of you  who've seen Clockwork Orange know what I'm talking about).  But if you like  any of the above movies, you'll definitely love Postal Worker!!",932947200,6,931,4.840764331210191
