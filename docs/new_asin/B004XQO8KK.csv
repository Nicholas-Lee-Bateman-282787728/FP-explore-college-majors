4496756,5,B004XQO8KK,"If you are a fan of Roy Orbison this is a great addition to your collection. This movie is fun, funny and stupid all at the same time. If you enjoyed any of Elvis' movies this one you need to see. Great music. It is a very good movie with popcorn and goobers.",1378598400,,259,3.9056603773584904
4496757,3,B004XQO8KK,"This is a very bad movie.  Too bad Roy Orbison didn't sing some of his favoriate songs.  He was good, but the movie was bad",1365120000,,123,3.88
4496758,5,B004XQO8KK,I've been trying to get this movie for years.  There are some great songs included and bring back great memories.,1364774400,,113,4.65
4496759,4,B004XQO8KK,"Johnny Banner (Roy Orbison) and Steve Menlo (Sammy Jackson) are Confederate officers in mufti on a dangerous mission.  In San Francisco in the early months of 1865, they're out to finance the South's fading war effort--and perhaps its recovery, if it can win--by stealing $150,000 in gold from the Mint.  And so they do.  Posing as medicine-showmen, accompanied by the dancing-and-singing Chestnut Sisters, Sue (Joan Freeman) and Flo (Maggie Pierce) and their four-woman backup, the Dancing Barmaids, they head for Texas to turn the gold over to a Confederate general.  But in Prescott, Arizona, they get stunning news: Lee has surrendered!  This, as Johnny points out, makes them not much different from outlaws.  Then their San Francisco contact, Charlie (Lyle Bettger), shows up, teams with money-hungry saloon-and-hotel owner Stella (Patricia Donahue), and sets to work to get the gold for himself.  And Prescott's law, all two of it (Douglas Kennedy, Ben Cooper), has ideas in the same direction.  Can Johnny and Steve keep hold of the gold long enough to decide what to do?

Though it's usually classed as a comedy-Western, a good bit of this--Roy Orbison's only film appearnce--is fairly serious, particularly the means by which they burgle the Mint.  Orbison, of course, sings, and there's an ongoing motif regarding his rocky relationship with Sue (Flo is in love with Steve, and he apparently with her), but the real gimmick is Johnny's guitar, which when you turn an ornament on the surface puts forth a rifle barrel.  A band of Indians determined to get their hands on this ""big medicine"" add another angle to the tale.  A slight but enjoyable movie entirely suitable for families.",1360195200,2,1693,5.094202898550725
4496760,3,B004XQO8KK,If there was a Hall of Fame for good guys in Rock 'N' Roll Roy Orbison would be in the first class.  That doesn't excuse his involvement in this fair-to-middling programmer.  Roy's thespian skills that are on display here run the gamut from A to...A.  It doesn't really matter because the filmmakers manage to successfully camoflauge Roy's lack of acting ability.  The story isn't much concerning a pair of Confederate spies(Orbison and Sammy Jackson) attempting to heist gold from the San Francisco Mint in the waning days of the Civil War.  Selling point is Roy's singing.  Note that I didn't say songs because they are rather pedestrian but Roy's heavenly pipes elevate them beyond the mundane.  I would recommend this film to Orbison fans and to others describe it as a rather innocuous affair.,1358985600,6,798,4.91044776119403
4496761,3,B004XQO8KK,"I purchased this for my husband who loves Roy Orbison.  He searched high and low for the sound track for this movie and I ordered the movie on dvd as a surprise for him.  Surprised he was and he immediately put it on the player to watch.  Although I saw the movie in the late 60's, I cannot say I enjoyed it.  Mr. Orbison was a singer and writer beyond compare and I wish he had been given a better role than this.  But if you are a fan, get it.  No one could sing like him and his song writing always touches the heart.  I do think given better roles he could have become a decent actor too but who is to say?  But if you are a fan, and love Roy, the dvd is for you!",1351555200,5,667,3.782608695652174
4496762,5,B004XQO8KK,"The only Western war comedy musical I can remember,
the story line is weak, but the sound track is classic
Roy Orbison. A must for the true Orbison Fan. I'm totally
thrilled it's out in DVD.",1331856000,4,190,4.305555555555555
4496763,3,B004XQO8KK,"Years ago I came across a CD in a store.  It was a soundtrack sung by Roy Orbison for a movie he starred in.  Years later I finally got the DVD and saw the movie.  Sure, Roy's acting fell far short of his great singing, but the story was refreshing for its time.  The story was set in the final days of the American Civil War with Roy playing a womanising Confederate spy with a heart.

My only disappointment is that not all of the soundtrack songs were included in the movie.  But, hey, I now have both.",1330560000,,505,4.1020408163265305
4496764,4,B004XQO8KK,"This is a must have DVD for all Roy Orbison's fans. The story is kind of funny, but the main point here is the songs sang by a Roy Orbison without his black glasses!!
The bad thing about this DVD is that it does not have any subtitle option.
Have fun!",1316563200,3,251,3.9411764705882355

4496780,3,B004XQO8KK,"""The Fastest Guitar Alive"" is a notorious musical stinker starring Roy Orbison (without his trademark glasses!) in his one cinematic starring role as a Confederate spy in the closing days of the Civil War. He's on special assignment with fellow traveler Sammy Jackson and their requisite female accomplices to appropriate $150,000 from the San Francisco mint to bolster the Confederacy's coffers. As if that premise wasn't ludicrous enough, please note the list of guest stars including Iron Eyes Cody (who should never be comic relief, and is sadly involved with the impressionist war paint-art critic subplot,) Sam the Sham (no comment,) and Poupe Gamin (really,) who utterly fail to help Roy elevate this film to high art. (Or simply art, high or not.)

There is no question Orbison had one of the greatest and most distinctive voices in music history, yet despite being a fan, the tunes in this film made me wince (particularly the onerous ""Snuggle Huggle."") There are elements that make ""The Fastest Guitar Alive"" entertaining, though I'm guessing not in the way Warner Brothers envisioned. Roy's combination guitar and rifle is an amusing weapon (but really hard to keep in tune) and inspires some hilarious dialogue like ""I can kill you with this and play your funeral march at the same time."" If the lack of a sensible backstory (Confederate spies as elixir salesmen?) deploys the characters on a one way mission to zaniness, their lack of critical thinking dooms their mission to failure, culminating in the absolutely mind-boggling shootout in Prescott where the entire cast converges and insanity reigns supreme. The ending is happy but ludicrous, and while the entire film is a disaster, perhaps the pinnacle of embarrassment involves Roy playing the tom toms (don't ask.)

This movie might (might!) be enjoyed by truly hardcore Roy Orbison fans who will love seeing a youthful Roy with no glasses, but the primary entertainment value here comes from viewing it as a camp classic.",1404086400,4,1992,5.08868501529052

4496784,3,B004XQO8KK,"I purchased this DVD knowing the work is less than stellar - but I needed it to complete a collection.  This movie is a good example of how things can go wrong when money drives production decisions instead of artistic values.  Roy Orbison left (at his manager's urging) Monument Records where he had been phenomenally successful to pursue movies and (allegedly) more artistic freedom.  Meanwhile script for this movie, originally intended as a western drama, was recast as a western comedy to exploit the success of ""Cat Ballou.""  The music written for this movie was very weak, consistent with the acting.",1385510400,,607,4.98019801980198
