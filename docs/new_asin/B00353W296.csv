4069875,1,B00353W296,"I agree with the other reviewer; this is a blatant Twilight rip-off. And it's nowhere near as good.

If you've seen Twilight you'll know this plot; young girl starts at new 'school' (which seems to have a single class). Meets young intiguing guy. Falls in love, thinks he's a vampire, and so on.

Even the ""Blood-red moon"" is a pale brown!",1274313600,7,339,4.540983606557377
4069876,1,B00353W296,"Do not be fooled by the ""If you love Twilight, you will love Blood Red Moon"", this movie is just a Twilight wannabe. It should be illegal to make a movie and depict the scenes as they did, it tried to immitate scenes from Twilight, notice I used the word ""tried"". The acting was cheesy, the storyline was ridiculious, and was so low budget, they apparently didn't even have a tripod to set the camera on, the camera shook and was not stable in most of the scenes. The only way to describe this movie is just plain HORRIBLE! Please do not waste your money.",1271721600,14,555,4.295238095238095
4069877,2,B00353W296,It's like Twilight but worst.  The acting is noticeable and the cast wears the same outfits everyday. It's boring. I almost fell asleep through it. If they do another movie please take my advice and change the clothes everyday and improve the acting.,1437523200,,250,4.813953488372093
4069878,5,B00353W296,as described arrived early,1433289600,,26,5.75
4069879,2,B00353W296,very low budget movie.  it was ok.,1432857600,,34,3.857142857142857
4069880,1,B00353W296,couldn't even watch ten minutes of this. I don't usually write reviews but this was a joke. Kind of had an idea it was going to be bad but it was worse than that.,1426982400,,162,3.7941176470588234
4069881,5,B00353W296,"It's hard for me to imagine why anyone would hate this movie.  It has scenes that could be considered romantic.  Things happen mysteriously, eluding explanation.  The acting was.... recorded on video!  What more could a person want?  Get it, watch it, love it.  Preferably while drinking.

The marketing on the front cover is misleading, however.  If you're a fan of Twilight, you will probably not like this movie.  If you're a fan of Shakespeare, on the other hand, you will undoubtedly fall for its wit and charms.",1422230400,2,517,4.850574712643678
4069882,4,B00353W296,"If you're looking for Twilight, skip this. If you enjoy things like MST3K and RiffTrax, then you'll love this. It's terrible. Horrible, honestly. No one changes clothing, scenes are reused ad nauseum. It's HILARIOUS. The dialogue sounds like it's written by a 12 year old girl, and the acting is probably expected of people that age as well.
One scene in this movie was so ridiculously terrible that I burst into random laughter thinking about it for a good week, and my boyfriend and I still regularly quote the terrible script because it's that funny.",1415664000,7,553,4.831578947368421

4069884,1,B00353W296,Gave you ever watched something so ridiculously terrible you couldn't stop watching? So fascinatingly bad you kept watching to see how bad it could really get? I just did that. Kick me.,1412553600,6,185,4.8125
4069885,1,B00353W296,Awful - the acting was so  poor I was only able to watch 5 minutes of it,1407196800,,72,3.235294117647059

4069887,1,B00353W296,"I typically enjoy a good B movie.
But this one was just bad acting.
Did not enjoy it",1406505600,,84,3.7222222222222223
4069888,1,B00353W296,What a waste of film,1405814400,,20,3.2
4069889,1,B00353W296,Just NO! turned it of within 10 minutes. The acting is like junior high play and the casting was worse.  JUST NO!!!!!!,1405209600,,118,4.363636363636363
4069890,1,B00353W296,"It's hard to imagine that anyone involved with this film looked at the finished product and thought, ""that's a job well done"".  It is brutally bad from start to finish (yes, I actually did watch till the end--how else would I know that Anna Banana did the catering for this movie).",1399161600,,281,4.509803921568627
4069891,1,B00353W296,"Just in the first few minutes I had to fast forward through it because the camera was shaking so much it actually gave me motion sickness... The acting is mediocre at best. I have never turned off a movie, but I just couldn't bare it any longer. It was turned off in the first 15 minutes.
This sounded like it would be a good movie, but poor quality on the camera action and the acting... who knows maybe they will sell the rights to someone who can actually work a camera..",1395360000,3,474,4.21978021978022
4069892,1,B00353W296,"Everybody was right. I may be scarred for life.

4069893,1,B00353W296,Im sorry but this was the worst movie I have ever watched! My grandson and his friends could have done better. Terrible acting. Definitely home made.,1384387200,,149,4.769230769230769
4069894,2,B00353W296,I rented this for a friend.  She said she didn't like it.  I didn't watch it.  It seemed boring. She said it was boring too.,1377561600,,124,3.88
4069895,1,B00353W296,Skip this one. The acting is beyond horrid and I could not even get past the first few minutes to find out what the actual plot was.,1374883200,5,132,3.925925925925926
4069896,3,B00353W296,"Let me preface this by saying that i purchased this movie as a joke. Do not buy this movie if you are expecting a great vampire movie ala Twilight. This is nothing more than a ripoff of Twilight in every way and should never be confused with a legitimate film. But that being said if you want to laugh at how horrible a movie can be then I highly recommend this movie. Everything about this movie is terrible..... the acting, the script, the ""special effects,"" the directing, the camera work, the lighting, everything! I bet even the catering was awful on this movie. I could have made this movie myself, with my phone, and it would have been as good as, if not better than this! But I promise that it is so bad that it is so good.",1367280000,9,731,4.266187050359712

4069898,1,B00353W296,"This video was beyond painful to try and watch. I watched about 15min and I had to skip it. "" Twilight""????? I mean seriously?
They compared the two! RUN AWAY! Don't do it! Don't waste streaming it OR buying it! I would rate it minus 0, but you can't...sigh.",1361404800,10,258,4.285714285714286
4069899,1,B00353W296,This was a cheap Twilight rip off filmed with mommy's camera and acted by volunteers.  2 hours you will never get back.,1360454400,2,119,4.409090909090909
4069900,1,B00353W296,"Honestly, this is the worst movie I have ever watched in my entire life. It is clearly a low budget film... a bunch of teenagers with a video camera. The acting was horrific and the plot was miserable. Actors/Actress' have the same clothes on each day, special effects or lack of special effects were pathetic. I could not watch this whole movie. The dialogue was ridiculousness. I believe my friends and I could make a better movie if I picked up a video camera and just started filming. Thank God I did not pay for this movie but even free it wasted my time.",1359849600,2,560,4.394230769230769

4069902,1,B00353W296,"I think this is terrible!! On the happier side tho, it was so funny to watch. They do need to put in the description that someone is buying a B movie and not a professional film. Just a bunch of kids in High School making a funny movie for class!",1335916800,7,246,3.94
4069903,5,B00353W296,"So everyone keeps crying about how it's a Twilight wannabe but really if you see it through a cult/campy lens, it's wonderful. It's hilarious. With the mix of bad acting, bad camera angles, and stock footage it's an instant classic. It's the perfect movie to get a bunch of friends and just laugh at it. It's chock full of memorable quotes and quirky plotholes. If you like bad movies or campy I highly recommend.",1323475200,4,413,4.594594594594595
4069904,1,B00353W296,"This film is definitely low budget. In the film, the main characters never changed clothing once, seemingly wearing the same clothes every day of the week.  Acting was horrible, as was the plot and special effects.  Don't waste your money.",1293840000,2,239,4.95
4069905,3,B00353W296,"The movie script first off is a rip off of the Vampire Diaries both book and tv show. Second off its very low budget filming and the actors sound rehearsed. I've seen this before when college drama students sling something together for a grade, which is fine, but to be fair it should be somewhere on the box in the description to warn people what they are renting or buying is not professionally made but is a bunch of kids trying to pass a class.",1290988800,,448,4.2823529411764705
4069906,1,B00353W296,"These actors try their best, but the director must have been, well I just can't fathom what he was thinking.  I could have directed this better straight out of rehab.  This person couldn't direct himself out of a hole in the ground.

The script writer is on another site bragging about how good this movie is.  Truly, truly, my friends, the world must be coming to an end.  For the legions of Hell have come up from the sulphury crags of the bottomless pit to direct and write this crap, supposedly to cause me an aneurysm.

My wife is still watching this, and you can't believe how much it sucks.  Oh God, please, put me out of my misery!  I'm sorry, I have to leave the room.",1283731200,2,677,4.275590551181103
8388620,3,B00353W296,The cast was alright  but they wore the same cloths all the time and the special affects were basic nothing special  but I did like the romance some of the parts were like in Twilight it could of been better.,1524873600,,208,4.175
8388621,2,B00353W296,"RELEASED TO VIDEO IN 2010 and directed by Scott Patrick, Blood Red Moon concerns two outcast students (Sarah Lavrisa & Michael Rogers) at a high school in Ottawa who develop a romantic relationship. The drama takes an interesting turn when Victor (Rogers) turns out to be a vampire who reveals the realities and myths about the undead to Megan (Lavrisa). Meanwhile a series of slayings start occurring, which are blamed on Victor. Mark Courneyea plays a sheriff and Shelley-Jean Harrison a teacher.

The opening credits are great because they feature mysterious forest photography (that looks like the coastal Redwoods of northern California) and a superb moving instrumental. The sylvan cinematography is briefly inserted throughout the rest of the flick. Unfortunately, the actual movie is spare change-budget filmmaking with the typical basic shots (e.g. the outside of the high school), dubious acting and all-around subpar filmmaking. The principle actors inexplicably appear in the SAME clothes throughout the runtime even though its clear that the events take place over the course of several days, like a week or two, and perhaps even longer.

That said, this is superior to the similar The Last Vampire on Earth (2010) due to the decent acting of the principle cast members. In The Last Vampire on Earth the wooden actors came across as if they were reading their lines from a teleprompter. The story here is also more interesting due to the mounting deaths and the whodunit factor, as well as the interesting data on vampirism that Victor unveils. Haley Beauchamp with her full head of red hair stands out as the haughty cheerleader.

THE FILM RUNS 70 minutes and was shot in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. WRITER: Kevin J. Lindenmuth.
