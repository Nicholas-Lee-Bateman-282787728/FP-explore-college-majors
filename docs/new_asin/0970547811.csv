All the materials needed to build your own flea circus are easily available, either from hardware stores/Ebay/Amazon/craft and hobby stores.

7794205,5,0970547811,"This  instructional video tape is absolutely fanastic. The directions are clear and easy to follow. The care the author puts into making his flea circus is shown. Following him, your flea circus will be fantastic. There are regular updates on his website, as well as new ideas and inspiration. The author has been extreamly helpful, which is worth far more than the cost of this video. I would recommend this to anyone interested in a fabulous presentation. Highly recommended. This is probably the best valued purchase a magician, clown, or other performer could make.",1114560000,,569,5.053191489361702

That being said, Walt combines the technical aspects with an entertaining presentation.
Bottom line is that you will know enough to build your own flea circus.
This video is outstanding",1084233600,,340,4.5
