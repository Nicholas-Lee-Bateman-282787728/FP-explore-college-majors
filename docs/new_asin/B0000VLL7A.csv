1954377,4,B0000VLL7A,"I have been a fan of Bernard Hill for many years...ever since the movie Shirley Valentine. I stumbled across Madagascar Skin by accident. At first, I wasn't sure about buying this film because every review I ran across wasn't very positive. However, I was pleasantly suprised and I am glad I took a chance on this film.
The movie does unfold a little slowly at the start but the acting is strong and Bernard Hill is a delight. The basic story is about two men that are outcasts from society, they find each other and end up falling in love despite one being gay and the other straight.
Yes, the film is a bit artsy and at times I wanted it to go a little deeper but it touched me, especially the end of the film. On one hand the end left me wanting more and caring about both characters and on the other hand it was appropriate and satisfying. Bravo to Harry and Flint for finding and holding on to their little piece of joy in this world.",1071792000,23,939,4.251396648044692

1954435,5,B0000VLL7A,"I loved this film! I'm a film buff, and have watched many, many films since the early 1970's, and this is one of the very best films I've ever seen about a gay man. Bernard Hill and John Hannah give beautiful, subtle and complex performances, and each actor created fascinating characters that I was riveted to, to see what they would do next. Chris Newby did an amazing job, balancing artful, thought provoking visuals with a simple but profound story of two people finding each other. I really loved the film because it shows the perspective of a gay man who's an outsider in society as well as an outsider in the mainstream gay culture, which I can identify with. The depiction of, or unfolding of the relationship that he develops with the straight man is very real, and familiar to me, in my own life experience. I absolutely love the way the film ends, for me it's a reminder that love is the most important thing in life, above all else. A thousand thank you's to Chis Newby for making this great film!",1460937600,5,1009,4.489130434782608

1954471,2,B0000VLL7A,"I will watch anything with John Hannah, which is the only reason I watched this.  He is a great actor, but this film left me wondering what it was really about.  I guess it confirms that John is a good actor, because I watched the whole movie.",1445731200,2,243,4.148936170212766

1954475,1,B0000VLL7A,"I wish some reviewer somewhere had warned that this movie contains images (verbal and/or visual) of animal suffering. Evidently so few people care about such things that no one bothers. I am doing it now.

I might have liked this movie otherwise. Most of what other reviewers say about it appeals to me strongly; I just cannot stand even hints of animal suffering in movies, so when Harry started telling about his job in the research lab I hit the STOP button hard, and I will not go back.

I know I will be ridiculed and reviled for writing this, but that is just too bad.",1306108800,5,574,4.40566037735849
1954476,3,B0000VLL7A,"It is a strange movie.

Suffering communicating problems because of his odd birthmark and financial situation, same gender attracted Harry found himself solaced by mature Flint, a sweet murderer, crook and womanizer with a string of stories untold.

A produce is of a good audio quality, a sort of a romantic tragic comedy of which live-to-live attitude rules.",1295481600,4,360,5.189655172413793
1954477,5,B0000VLL7A,"TAKEN FROM MY NATIONAL ARTS CLUB PROGRAM: A unique gem of a film evocative of ""Harold and Maude,"" ""Alice in Wonderland,"" a Grimm's fairy tale and ""The Odd Couple"" all rolled up into one, going from despair to uplifting Chaplinesque ending.  Far transcends (and is not part of) the new ""Queer cinema""(though would be a worthy addition). Very embracing, humane. The filmmaker has been very quiet since - but take note: an earlier film was selected for the Cannes Film Fest's ""A Certain Slant"" films of special originality and distinction.

PLOT: Harry, a despairing gay man spurned because of a port-wine birthmark shaped like Madagascar on his face, abandons the twilight world of London's gay club scene. Wandering a deserted beach, he kicks an overturned bucket and discovers Flint---buried up to his head. A weather worn, worldly ""heterosexual"" with a murky past, Flint lets Harry nurse him back to health in an abandoned cottage.  As their  mutual distrust melts away, something magical happens---reminding us love can be found in the strangest places.  NY TIMES ""Chris Newby's exquisitely photographed film...a surreal comic ode to unlikely erotic fulfillment."" I screened this at the National Art Club, selecting it under the Film Experts' series of ""favorite"" little known film.

1954478,5,B0000VLL7A,"This European import is more than a gay love story: it's a film packed with startling images, and a work of cinematic literature.

When a shy gay man rejected at local gay bars because of a large birthmark on his face flees his lonely life and makes his way to a remote patch of coastline, a chance encounter with a shady older man shatters his self-imposed exile from the world of men and leads to love. But the journey is neither easy... nor straight, in any sense of the word.

This lovely film from 1995 features early work by John Hannah and Bernard Hill, both of whom have gone on to do well for themselves in Hollywood productions. It also marks Chris Newby's last turn as writer / director; when oh when will Newby make another movie?",1219968000,4,742,4.408759124087592

Sometimes what we seek comes in the most unexpected ways and forms. The acting was exceptional and this surely was one of the most cleaver and original plots I've seen.

8003823,4,B0000VLL7A,"""Madagascar Skin,"" from the U.K., is one of those rare films that reward repeated viewings, revealing new complexities, new insights, and, sometimes, raising new questions that can't be answered. The characters aren't the usual superficial pretty boys, the story is deeply romantic not despite but almost because the two men find the love that binds them to each other very slowly and against considerable odds. I found it consistently engaging and surprising, including a happy ending, sort of. Worth watching. More than once.",1494288000,,527,5.36144578313253
8003824,5,B0000VLL7A,"I really liked this movie!  I thought it was very touching...a lonely and scared man meets a crusty and crude guy.  It wasn't so much about gay/straight for me, it was about finding love when you least expect it...with the two most unlikely sorts.  I will say, the dream sequences were a little confusing...but all in all, it was nicely done and very heartwarming.

I'd gladly watch this movie again.",1493164800,2,400,4.671428571428572
