8307412,2,B001GXT84Y,DVD treats subject rather superficially and not to the depth I was expecting.  There are better Lowrance DVDs on the market than this particular brand.,1361491200,,151,5.04
8307413,1,B001GXT84Y,"This gives limited, confusing information and is not worth the money. I wish Lowrance had better instruction available. Don't waste your money.",1357171200,,143,5.545454545454546
8307414,4,B001GXT84Y,"If you are a novice looking for detailed assistance...you have found the right video!  I am very much a visual learner and this video helped me tremendously by showing me where to go instead of just directing me where to go.

If you are a person with average knowledge of electronics...this video is a great quick reference guide.

If you are an expert...well, you probably aren't looking for this kind of video anyway.",1304985600,,419,4.712328767123288
