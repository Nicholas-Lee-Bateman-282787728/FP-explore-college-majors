This box set from Arrow Film combines two films by director Luciano Ercoli, an Italian director with little output in that role and only double that as a producer. While his output wasn't significant the quality of these two films shows much potential and the fact that had he chosen to do more he would have left a larger legacy behind for others to follow. As it is, both films offer well-made giallo films that fans of the genre will want to add to their collections.

The first of the two is DEATH WALKS ON HIGH HEELS and is the better of the two films. The film stars the directors wife Nieves Navarro as Nicole Rochard, a well-known and much sought after striptease artists in France. Nicoles father was a renowned jewel thief and when hes killed someone calls her asking if she has his last score, something she knows nothing about.

A fan of Nicoles, Dr. Robert Matthews, attends nearly every performance she has no matter where shes working. After Nicole has an argument with her boyfriend over his drinking due being jealous of her success, she finds friendship and love in the arms of Matthews. After a quick romance heads home to England and she accompanies him. He sets her up in a house in the country, a place his wife knows nothing about. With promises of leaving her to set up his own practice, things begin to happen.

Murders of various side characters occur with startling frequency. An attack on Matthews happens, his wife the main suspect. Nicoles boyfriend shows in England trying to find her. And a twist near the middle of the film comes completely out of nowhere and sends the film off in a new direction. While this may seem like a brief synopsis to reveal any more would be to spoil the surprises the film has in store.

The movie works best as a mystery with clues being presented for the viewer to decipher but all doesnt become clear until the end of the film. What makes it work is that they all make sense and were there for the most part to be seen throughout the film. What makes it even better is the fact that even the most jaded mystery fan might have a difficult time knowing who did what to whom, something few mysteries can accomplish these days.

The second film, DEATH WALKS AT MIDNIGHT, once again stars Navarro this time as super model Valentina. Valentina tries an experimental drug in the presence of a reporter friend and while on the drug sees images of a murder taking place. The fact she took the drug ends up in his article and she loses work because of it. It also discusses her visions and suddenly she begins seeing the murderer tracking her. When he makes an attempt on her life, only she has seen him. Is there someone out to kill her or is she simply hallucinating it all?

Characters appear for no reason with no background only to take center stage at various parts of the film. As viewers even we aren't sure of Valentinas mental state at first. While the film starts with a decent premise it becomes a are you kidding me film as stupid decisions are made from start to finish. An example is, after having been attacked by someone she doesnt see, Valentina is asked to get in the car of a woman she has never met to talk and go for a drive. Not the smartest thing to do. When the woman abandons her in a mental institution where the convicted killer of the victim she saw in her drugged state is at (who is also supposed to be the sister of this woman), Valentina leaves only to go with the same woman to another location later on. With enough moments like this the movie became frustrating for me as a viewer.

But good or bad the main thing here is that two movies that may have been lost to the world have been rediscovered and brought out in the best possible transfer possible. Arrow once again goes above and beyond to deliver a package that fans will clamor to and others may want to see to get a taste of what giallo is all about, if for no other reason than the first film. Both display great cinematography that Ive not come to expect in Italian made films from the time. Another plus.

Keeping in mind that this is an Arrow Films release you know there will be plenty of extras on hand for those that enjoy them. Included in the box set is a limited edition 60 page booklet with writings from authors Danny Shipka, Troy Howarth and Leonard Jacobs, all non-fiction writers about the giallo genre, that includes stills and posters for both films. For the first film youll find extras like an introduction by screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi, an archive interview with Ercoli and Navarro, an interview with Gastaldi, an interview with composer Stelvio Cipriani, the original Italian trailer and an English trailer. On the second film youll find another introduction by Gastaldi, an audio commentary track by film critic Tim Lucas, and extended TV version, an interview with Gastaldi and a visual essay by Michael Mackenzie discussing the collaborations between Ercoli and Navarro.

Fans of giallo will find this a must have. The same for collectors of Italian cinema of that time period. Fortunately for both, Arrow Film has done a marvelous job on this one, making it one worth owning as well as worth watching for those new to the genre.",1462752000,,5261,4.5226077812828605
7565522,4,B01991ZKIW,"Review was originally written for my site Mind of Tatlock. Product was provided for review.

You would be hard pressed to find a disappointing Giallo. Most of them are able to offer something exciting. It could either be stunning women, blood or beautiful sets filled with colour. The greats like Argento and Bava know how to insert all that into a film  Blood and Black Lace from Mario Bava springs instantly to mind. All of this brings me to a director I wasn't aware of until Arrow Video decided to release the fantastic Death Walks Twice Blu-ray boxed-set that Im reviewing today. The two films included in the boxed-set are Death Walks on High Heels and Death Walks at Midnight, both of the movies directed by Luciano Ercoli. The films are also written my Giallo master Ernesto Gastaldi (Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key). Both films tick off everything Ive listed above. It has the beautiful Nieves Navarro (going by Susan Scott in these two flicks), a bit of blood  moreso in Death Walks At Midnight, and amazing sets in Milan, Paris and the English coast. The films both succeed at giving the viewer a mystery that won't be easy to solve and keeps you entertained the entire way through. The boxed-set from Arrow Video is once again, a fantastic release. If you want to know what comes in the set and how damn good the movies are, read on

Death Walks on High Heels:

Nieves Navarro plays Nicole, a striptease artist whos work borders on extreme racism  her one act involving black face is probably the biggest racist striptease Ive ever seen. It isn't her risque job that gets her into trouble, though, but in fact her fathers line of work. Her father is a bank robber, who recently stole some diamonds and hide them somewhere. He is murdered by a masked individual who is looking for said diamonds. The police believe Nicole knows where the diamonds are and the masked killer thinks the same. Her life is in danger and she believes her boyfriend (Sim&oacute;n Andreu) could be the killer. Due to this fear, Nicole hooks up with the dashing gentlemen Dr. Robert Matthews (Frank Wolff) and goes with him to his seaside cottage in the English countryside. However, death follows her to her little oasis and her life is put on the line.

Death Walks on High Heels screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi crafts a fantastic murder mystery that will keep you guessing until the very end. He also does things a little differently with his characters, which I won't spoil. Youll definitely be shocked and appropriately confused with Death Walks on High Heels.

The film does slow down a bit during the middle half, especially due to a certain character being absent from the plot, but it never once feels boring. Its a movie that after you figure out who the killer is, youll want to go back and watch the movie again to see the little hints at who is doing the sleuthing and murdering.

Death Walks at Midnight:

The next movie in this wonderful boxed-set is Death Walks at Midnight, which is once again written by Ernesto Gastaldi and directed by Luciano Ercoli. It also stars Nieves Navarro and several other actors who were in Death Walks on High Heels. The film was released in 1971, so the two films feel very similar in look and style.

Taking a cue from Alfred Hitchcocks Rear Window, Death Walks at Midnight has Valentina (Navarro) witnessing a murder across from her apartment while high on a hallucinogen. She at first is not sure if it was real or some drug induced fantasy, but when the killer she pictured starts stalking her, she realizes its very much a real thing. Valentina goes to the police, but they are no help, so she decides to conduct her own investigation.

Death Walks at Midnight is yet another fantastic murder mystery, with a strong female lead. Unlike the normal damsels in distress, who collapse at the first sight of something scary, the character of Valentina is a strong woman, who takes charge. She does fall into that cliche damsel in distress role in the middle of the movie, wanting and needing a man to comfort her, however, thats only for a short period and she is back in charge in no time.

As for the mystery, I had a few ideas as to what was going on, but in the end, I was still very much surprised. Death Walks at Midnight was a wonderful Giallo that should keep you entertained. It also has a bit of the red stuff to entice gorehounds and you cant go wrong with Navarro, as she is drop dead gorgeous.

Blu-ray Opinion:

Sliding in nicely next to other Arrow Video boxed-sets, Death Walks Twice is another fantastic release, which comes in a hard cardboard sleeve, with an impressive 60-page booklet to read. The audio and video for both films are damn impressive. Each film retains a nice look, with even audio and video. Death Walks at Midnight does switch over to English for a small section if you're listening to the Italian dub. This was due to the original Italian audio being too damaged. Other than that small, tiny thing, the rest of everything else is near perfect.

Death Walks on High Heels features an impressive lineup of special features. First and foremost is an audio commentary with film critic Tim Lucas. Next, you have a quick introduction to the film by screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi. There is also an interview with actress Nieves Navarro and director Luciano Ercoli. This feature doesnt talk much about Death Walks on High Heels. In fact, not many of the features talk about the movie but instead discuss the Giallo genre instead. Im not saying its a bad thing, as the interview with Ernesto Gastaldi is damn entertaining for any fan of the Giallo, but I do wish more was discussed in regards to the making of Death Walks on High Heels.

Death Walks at Midnight doesnt feature as many special features as High Heels, but what is provided is very much welcome. You have another commentary with Tim Lucas, an introduction to the movie and an interview with Ernesto Gastaldi, a visual essay about actress Nieves Navarro, which provides a nice dissection of her career in regards to the two Death films in this set. Another nice feature is the 105 minute TV version, which features different scenes from the theatrical cut. An all-around impressive set of features.

Verdict:

The Death Walks Twice boxed-set from Arrow Video is an easy recommend. The two films provide plenty of everything a Giallo fan wants. If I had to pick a favorite, I would probably say Death Walks at Midnight, but you cant go wrong with either one. The special features are going to keep you busy for awhile, which is usual with Arrow Videos releases. This is a big recommend.",1461542400,4,6629,4.640784982935154
7565523,4,B01991ZKIW,"Now one has to admit, neither Death Walks on High Heels nor Dead Walks at Midnight are absolute classics of the giallo genre - and they deservedly aren't, lacking originality and suffering from over-convoluted plots ... but that said, they're just great to watch, they're stylishly directed, their imagery is erotically charged without just being sleazy, they feature suspense and violence in just the right places - in other words, they're both just great genre entertainment that shouldn't be missed!!!",1460246400,2,504,5.3125
7565524,4,B01991ZKIW,"At this point I think we can skip the brief history of the Italian giallo genre, in all its twisted, seedy, sexy, blood-drenched glory.  If you're unfamiliar with the specifics, check out Troy Howarth's 2015 book So Deadly, So Perverse which will not only introduce you to the major and minor titles, but inspire you to spend a small fortune tracking them all down.  At least Arrow Video saves you a couple of bucks by packaging Death Walks in High Heels and Death Walks at Midnight together in a beautiful new box set under the clever moniker Death Walks Twice.  Both films are from producer-turned-director Luciano Ercoli and both are beautifully entangled in conventions of the genre.  If Argentos work is the zenith of dream-logic creative excess  all style and fury, signifying nothing  then Ercoli should at least earn notoriety as the giallo antithesis, connecting his convoluted plots with so many clues, suspects, detectives and dead-ends your head will be spinning for days afterward.

Made in 1971 and 1972 respectively, both films star Susan Scott (Ercolis wife), Simon Andreu and several other bit players, although no one plays the same role twice.  As the heroine, Scott in particular gets to portray considerably different characters, first as Valentina, a fiery Italian fashion model who witnesses a violent murder while under the influence of an LSD-type drug in Death Walks at Midnight.  Its a familiar giallo motif  the questionable memory of an unreliable witness  that Ercoli promptly ignores for most of the rest of the film.

After the violent set-up, the film plays out as a straight-forward mystery in very linear fashion, without the usual 20-minute pit-stops to refill the films tank with helpless victims.  In fact, Midnight may be one of the most inoffensive giallos you'll ever seen.  However, theres a certain appeal to Ercolis denial of these exploitation elements, teasing us with hints of danger and brutality that never occur until the films action-packed finale.  But even this cathartic conclusion oddly re-introduces Andreus ancillary character for the big showdown, rather than Valentina, who did all the legwork.

As with most entries in the genre, theres no way on Gods green earth youll ever guess whos the culprit until he or she reveals themselves.  But in Midnight, that honestly seems to be Ercolis intention, saving the revelation for a choice moment that is truly a shocker.  Factor in the films penchant for lightning quick verbal exchanges (those subtitles just fly across the screen) and more than a few stand-out visual moments (Valentinas drug-induced visions are accompanied with a cool carotid camera shudder), and Midnight makes for yet another interesting deviation from the giallo norm.

Its follow-up, Death Walk on High Heels, is a bit more fun, mostly due to Susan Scotts unleashed sexual energy.  As a Parisian stripper on the run, Scott showcases her body on several occasions, seduces men with her sultry eating habits, and wears more wigs than a seasons worth of Alias episodes.  And she manages to pull it all off while avoiding an unseen stalker who believes shes hiding a cache of stolen diamonds.

When Scott disappears from the plot mid-way through the film, things return to Ercolis more reserved murder-by-numbers style.  But with fewer suspects and an isolated setting  this time a quaint English village  its much more fun to guess whos who and puzzle out motivations.  High Heels is also lighter in tone, and more apt to have fun with its cast of exaggerated characters.  A more likeable film all around, Ercoli hits a balance of sex, violence and humor that most genre fans will find irresistible.

Arrow's new Blu-ray double-feature easily surpasses the previous 2006 release from NoShame in both picture quality and extras, although everyone should hang on to that previously included CD of composer Stelvio Cipriani tracks.  Everything here is all new and spread across both discs, including a pair of interviews with screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi covering his Giallo for Dummies breakdown for aspiring writers and his career in general.  Ercoli and Susan Scott share a 30-minute segment; Cipriani gets one all to himself.  Desperately Seeking Susan is yet another fast-track film class narrated by Michael Mackenzie who explores Susan Scott's contribution to the pantheon of giallo heroines.  But the most valuable information comes from Tim Lucas' commentary tracks.  Well-prepared and overstuffed with facts both obvious and obscure, Lucas is a seasoned pro and it shows.

Final product includes a 60-page booklet with new writing from Howarth and a reversible sleeve with newly commissioned artwork.  Limited to 3000 copies, Death Walks Twice should have no problem selling out.  If you haven't pre-ordered you might want get out the black gloves and start clicking.",1459555200,9,4850,5.1651728553137
7565525,3,B01991ZKIW,"Death Walks Twice is a box set containing two feature films from the early 1970s directed by Luciano Ercoli and starring the directors wife Nieves Navarro (billed under her adopted stage name of Susan Scott) as the leading character in peril. Both films  in Italian, with English subtitles  fall into the category of giallo, named for the yellow-jacketed pulp paperback thrillers popular in Italy during the 60s and 70s.

In Death Walks On High Heels""(1971), Scott is an erotic nightclub dancer who incorporates an assortment of body paint and wigs in her act. She is stalked by a killer in a ski mask who is determined to get his hands on her murdered fathers stolen jewels. Desperate to get out of town, she turns to nightclub regular Dr. Robert Matthews (Frank Wolff), a rich British surgeon, who takes her to his home in the English countryside. Her pursuer, however, doesnt give up easily and soon more murders occur.

Death Walks at Midnight (1972) stars Scott as Valentina, a model tricked into taking a hallucinogenic drug during a photoshoot who witnesses a brutal murder in the apartment opposite hers. When its revealed that the savage slaying she describes relates to a crime that took place six months earlier, the police are perplexed. Much of the movie is spent with Valentina trying to convince a police inspector and her boyfriend that shes witnessed a murder. This film is reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcocks Rear Window, in which invalid James Stewart thinks hes witnessed a man across the courtyard covering up the murder of his wife. Brian De Palmas Sisters, made a year after Death Walks at Midnight, covers similar ground.

Director Ercoli knows how to establish suspense and hold our attention as he presents lurid tales of murder. These are stories inspired by American film noir, but with a lot more sex, violence and blood. Like American noir, the films feature seamy, cynical types in unsavory, often dangerous, settings. The scripts of both movies are well crafted, and Ms. Scott  though no Meryl Streep  is an effective femme fatale. Production design is stylish and there is a pervasive feeling that danger lurks in unexpected places and at unexpected times.

Both Blu-ray and standard DVD versions are included in the 4-disc box set. Bonus features include a visual essay exploring the collaboration between director Luciano Ercoli and star Susan Scott; audio commentary by film critic Tim Lucas; newly-edited archive interview with director Luciano Ercoli and actress Susan Scott; introductions to both films by screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi; interviews in which Gastaldo discusses what constitutes good giallo; and reversible sleeves featuring original and newly commissioned artwork.",1459036800,4,2715,5.154545454545454

Death Walks on High Heels / Death Walks at Midnight
Amos Lassen
Death Walks Twice is a double disc set of two features from Luciano Ercoli and also includes a third disc: a CD of film music from Stelvio Cipriani.
In Death Walks on High Hells, Susan Scott plays a very sexy erotic nightclub dancer who uses different wigs and body paint in her act. She is stalked by a killer in a ski mask with bright blue eyes. Suspicion falls on her live-in boyfriend (Simon Andreu) when blue contact lenses are found in their medicine cabinet. She looks to an infatuated nightclub patron Dr. Robert Matthews (Frank Wolff) who is a wealthy British surgeon and he takes her to his home in the English countryside. However, she doesnt get away from her pursuer so easily, and the seaside setting has more than its fair share of eccentric suspects as a number of murders ensue.
In a film based on a story by Sergio Corbucci, Death Walks at Midnight, fashion model Valentina (Susan Scott) agrees to be injected with an experimental drug for her tabloid journalist boyfriend (Simon Andreu). Her identity will remain secret when the result of the experiment are made public. After drug is given to her, Valentina witnesses the brutal murder of a young woman by a peculiar man wearing a spiked metal glove. Later, Valentinas photo and details of the ordeal are published as a full-blown cover story and it turns out that the whole thing was a set up. A subsequent job offer turns out to be another set up, as Valentina meets the murderer from her vision who is now stalking her with the same metal glove. She escapes but when she identifies the man for the police, they tell her that he committed suicide.
Both films were obviously made as vehicles for starlet Susan Scott, wife of director Ercoli. Scott possesses an undeniable sex appeal of bedroom eyes and a beautiful body. In Death Walks at Midnight, she portrays a women trying to identify a killer while dodging him at the same time, and in Death Walks in High Heels an independent yet opportunist character takes an odd turn halfway through the picture. Both films have flaws yet they both pull us in. Both films are violent and both have fine supporting casts.
The third disc in the set is an excellent CD called The Sound of Love & Death and contains various soundtrack music from Stelvio Cipriani. composer for HIGH HEELS. Although the CD features no music from the films on this set, it contains 18 tracks from 18 other Italian films he composed.",1458604800,,2504,4.629213483146067
