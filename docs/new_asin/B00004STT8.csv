7922048,5,B00004STT8,"The 1980s Miffy

Drawings true to the Dick Bruna Classics.

Children's voice narration with an English Accent.

Music is soft, and relaxing.

Your Toddler will Love them!

And the parents will get 30 minutes of time...",1099872000,,218,4.944444444444445
7922049,5,B00004STT8,"My daughter shrieks with excitement when she sees the box for this tape.  I've bought all five available and the three best are in constant rotation--daily--and I can honestly say I still enjoy them.  I think I'm in love with the kids who do the narration, and the animation has a combination of simplicity and cleverness ranking with any classic thing along these lines.  & the musical score!  I'm a huge fan now.
By the way, this isn't the more 3-dimensional Miffy currently shown on children's tv, which is nice to look at but otherwise cloying and nowhere near so good as this series here.
I'm posting this review here because this is the one I first got, but I'd give the same thumb up for Here's Miffy and for The Christmas Book...the other two are, I guess, more for ""completists"".  NB There's a Miffy website which can supply any Miffy needs that Amazon can't.",1073433600,,868,4.574193548387097
7922050,5,B00004STT8,"I got to tell you, this video puts me to sleep. The music and simplistic style are maddening to an adult, but to a two year old, its nervana. Trips to the zoo and the beach. Counting and other games. Your child will love this video and after 6 or 7 hundred viewing you may grow to love it as well. (most likely not, but the joy it will give your child is well worth the pain of viewing it...)",980812800,5,392,3.9125
