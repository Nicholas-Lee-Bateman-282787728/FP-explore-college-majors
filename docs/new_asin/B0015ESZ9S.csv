8258177,3,B0015ESZ9S,"Not a bad DVD of unsold pilots. The video quality varies, of course, so don't expect HD picture and sound. The fire department drama Chicago 2-1-2 is the best of the lot, having appeared as an episode of Cavalcade of America back in the day, and features Frank Lovejoy and Roy Thinnes. Unsolved has Simon Oakland as a barely-renamed Bugsy Siegel, and The Shadow pilot is really primitive on all counts. The Bogus Green plays like the first and last reel of a b-movie about a circus more than any kind of TV pilot, but I can't find much information about it at all.",1432512000,,564,4.4326923076923075

8258179,3,B0015ESZ9S,"Lost Crime Shows consists of four unsold, but interesting, television pilots that were lensed in the 50s and early 60s.

In ""The Shadow:  The Case of the Cotton Kimono"" (1954), Lamont Cranston, a psychiatrist retained by the local police department to assist in difficult cases, is asked to assist the investigation of a beautiful woman who has been savagely murdered.  When the police detective leading the investigation frames his prime suspect, Cranston assumes his alter ego as ""The Shadow"", a hero who appears to be invisible because of this power to cloud men's minds, to find the real killer. Cranston/The Shadow is played by Tom Helmore with Paula Raymond playing the lovely Margo Lane, the only person who knows of Cranston's secret identity.

""Unsolved"" (1960) was to have been a series which fictionalized real life crimes to show one possible solution to the felony.  The pilot episode concerns the rise and fall of West Coast racketeer and would-be Las Vegas gambling tycoon Mugsy Heidel (played by Simon Oakland).  Any resemblance to the murder of Bugsy Siegel in 1947 was purely intentional.  Featured in the outstanding cast were Joe De Santis, Lisa Gaye, John Marley, Dabbs Greer, Aneta Corsault and Joseph Ruskin.

""Chicago 2-1-2"" (1957) tells the story of a fire department investigator searching for an arsonist who has set a series of life-threatening blazes.  The series was filmed during late winter in the Windy City and the slushy, bleak urban landscape is a definite plus.  The pilot episode, starring Frank Lovejoy as the investigator and a very young Roy Thinnes as one on the suspects, aired on ""Cavalcade of America"".

""The Bogus Green"" (1951) relates the trials and travails of a contemporary circus.  It starred Preston Foster as two-fisted advance man Brass McGannon, who is in hot water up to his eyeballs when his outfit is pinpointed by the Secret Service as the source of counterfeit bills flooding the area.  The outstanding cast features Martha Vickers, Clancy Cooper, Don Beddoe and William Boyett.

Part of the fun watching these episodes is trying to guess why the networks did not select these pilots to serve as the foundation for future series.  Did ""The Shadow"" fail because an invisible hero worked better on radio and in print that in a video medium?  Could viewers relate to a fictional ""Unsolved"" crime?  Did ""Chicago 2-1-2"" spend too much time on narration and not enough on action?  Was lead character Brass McGannon too dour and downbeat for a weekly audience?  It's hard to say.  As individual episodes, though, these four shows were as good as the typical weekly programming viewers saw in the 1950s.",1285977600,7,2655,5.004555808656036
