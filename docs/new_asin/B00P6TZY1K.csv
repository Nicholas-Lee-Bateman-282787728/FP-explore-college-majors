6787843,3,B00P6TZY1K,"This a a good family film.  The story line is  one that portrays a family situation dealing with  grief, disapointments and moving forward with their lives in spite of these  obstacles. Good life lessons we all have to learn.",1424476800,5,225,4.6923076923076925

6787847,4,B00P6TZY1K,It's a shame that this movie is fictional.  It shows that seeing is not believing. Enjoyable to watch.,1420761600,4,102,4.666666666666667
6787848,2,B00P6TZY1K,"Contrived and a little too far out there to be swallowed. Too many coincidences. Stiff acting. The scenery and period details were nice but the story was dumb and not at all believable or universal. I am so looking forward to the day when Mormon movies can appeal to wide audiences. That will open happen when filmmakers drop their agendas and focus on story, character development, and honesty. There are lots of good stories that with universal appeal and themes throughout Mormon history. Why oh why does everything have to be so preachy and self-centered.",1419292800,2,559,4.894736842105263

6787850,2,B00P6TZY1K,I was hoping this movie would be similar to 17 miracles or Ephraims Rescue.  I was disappointed because it didn't capture my interest right away nor through out. I thought it was very predictable.,1418083200,,196,4.764705882352941
6787851,3,B00P6TZY1K,"An action adventure geared for tweens and family viewing. The script is a bit stilted, but found this story a new way to approach LDS films, based on historical events (grim reality of mob violence towards Mormons in 1800s) but an entirely fictional adventure. Makes for a good showing with family.",1494115200,,298,4.862745098039215
6787852,5,B00P6TZY1K,"That this is not historically accurate is a fair criticism.  In fact, the plot may be described as ridiculous.  But they say the same of ""The Book of Mormon"", and that book is the most true of any on Earth.  This movie is inspirational.  It is not ""propaganda"", as used by many to describe faith-based movies.  Propaganda by its very nature does not encourage love.  This movie does.  It is not perfect, but it will point anyone wishing to learn about love in the right direction.  And for that, I give it 5 stars.",1492041600,,514,4.3936170212765955

6787887,1,B00P6TZY1K,"Having had Mormon neighbors for 33 years, I found this story sorely lacking in basic factual ""LDS"" info, which is purposely shrouded.  For if people knew their ""levels"" of beliefs, even Christians as I would run for the hills.  No one is to add to or take away from the Bible.  A cult is a cult.  And intolerance of other beliefs?  Sounds like Catholics to me, also.  Jesus is Lord.",1485561600,,382,4.385714285714286

6787936,1,B00P6TZY1K,"I had a revelation, I mean, insight about faith-based movies: everything is about faith. The plot, the theme, and characterization is about faith. Although earlier evangelical films were at least about one character's eventual salvation experience, ""16 Candles"", I mean ""16 Stones"" doesn't even have that. It's primarily about three young Mormons on a quest to find 16 stones that will prove the veracity of the Mormon faith, if only the three hapless heroes can have enough - waits for it - faith! That's when I had my revaluation: when characters are written as all having the same story arc - and any antagonists are simply ""bad"" and ""evil"" (and I quote) - then the viewer is stuck with a flat, dragging (non) story. These characters are not even two-dimensional, but one-dimensional! What makes many secular and the occasional religious film interesting are complex, complicated characters whose motivations are often in conflict with themselves and with each other. Likewise, the plot(s) involve story arcs wherein at least a few of the central characters change over the course of the story. ""16 Stones"" is best viewed for religious education or LDS propaganda for the choir. All others watch only to help insomnia.",1484611200,6,1221,5.079601990049751

Christensen movie 17 Miracles or Ephraims Rescue but I was mixed up and thought this was one of his. T.C. does a great job, this movie was awful. The acting was bad, filming was bad, story was completely fictional and corny. That's what I get for not paying attention when purchasing. Still have yet to see the newer T.C. films, but heard great things about them, and excited to get the Right movie next time..",1463961600,,508,4.247422680412371

8686595,4,B00P6TZY1K,"The vast discrepancy in all the evaluations of this movie was the first thing that made me curious enough to want to watch it for myself to see what the truth was. People were saying it was the worst movie ever with horrible acting. Nothing could be further from the truth. I judge them as Tyler Perry style actors and people spend millions watching his movies and television shows. I'm not of the Mormon faith, but I found this movie very interesting because of it's historical value. Not only because of the Mormon history, but it taught me things about the Native Americans that I did not know before. My grandmother was full-blooded Cherokee Indian and the things this movie revealed were very enlightening. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone interested in anything like that. It's not for people who want a shoot em up kind movie because Mormons are not violent people. There is violence done to them but they do not respond in kind....which might frustrate a lot of people. Also, they are gullible and that is frustrating. You wonder why after they get robbed and beaten up they don't quit trusting people. So those are the pros and cons.",1498867200,8,1153,4.684729064039409
