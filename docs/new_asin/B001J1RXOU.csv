8311725,5,B001J1RXOU,"Matchbox Twenty has some of the most meaningful, deep music that just about anyone can relate to, especially baby boomers, I think.
This music book is for piano and guitar and even I, someone who doesn't play piano everyday as I should to play well, am able to follow the music and play well enough to enjoy. It's not so elementary that it wouldn't challenge an avid piano player, it's not too difficult for a beginner either. It's nice to read the words of the songs I love to sing when playing my CD too.

If you enjoy Matchbox Twenty as much as I do and love to play piano (or guitar) I can just about guarantee you'd enjoy this song book as much as I.",1455062400,,655,4.198412698412699
