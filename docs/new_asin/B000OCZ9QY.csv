an important  part of the American music scene !
This will be an important historical record  to pass on
to your kids !",1364774400,,165,4.290322580645161
8184524,4,B000OCZ9QY,"Dave is great, he is in a league of talents that is a small circle.  The filming is typical ACL and the sound is good.  That's not what this guy is about.  He has a sensitivity and way of seeing life in the USA that not many have.  His acoustic set is great and the electric gets even better.  If you're wondering if you should buy this don't worry, it's money well spent.  And don't miss a chance to see him in person.",1215043200,5,419,3.9879518072289155

8184526,2,B000OCZ9QY,"The lyrics are hard to hear because of poor mixing.  Was never a big Blasters fan but if you love Dave Alvin you will like it.  I am basically indifferent about it; not bad, not real good.",1193702400,,188,4.054054054054054
8184527,4,B000OCZ9QY,"I couldn't agree with Bluzman more. I've only been a fan for the last ten years or so. A good friend of mine turned me on to him. He is really an eclectic performer. From Folk,Country to Blues To Old School Rock & Roll, This guy can play it all.  It's a crime he Isn't more well known. While this DVD Is very good, It doesn't capture the energy he's capable of playing with. Check out the Blasters live reunion cd. His guitar playing rips on that one. A great singer, songwriter and guitar player. I live way out in West Tx, but I hope to see him live one of these days. Dave do put out a current DVD and play with the passion and fire we know your capable of.",1180656000,5,660,4.0
8184528,5,B000OCZ9QY,"I'VE BEEN A FAN OF DAVE ALVIN FOR ALMOST 25 YEARS AND IT'S SAD THAT ALL WE HAVE IS ONE 60 MINUTE DVD DONE IN 1999. HE PUTS ON ONE OF THE BEST LIVE SHOWS AROUND BEGINNING WITH HIS TIME WITH THE BLASTERS THRU HIS SOLO EFFORTS. THIS DVD ONLY SCRATCHES THE SURFACE WHEN IT COMES TO HIS TALENTS.

CHECK OUT HIS VAST COLLECTION OF CD'S HE'S DONE. ALL STYLES OF ""AMERICAN MUSIC"" FROM FOLK TO HARD ROCK. THIS CAT DOES IT ALL WITH A UNIQUE FLAVOR.

PLEASE DAVE, RECORD A FULL LIVE SET WITH YOUR BAND. YOU HAVE MORE FANS THAN YOU REALIZE..................",1180483200,8,545,4.230769230769231
