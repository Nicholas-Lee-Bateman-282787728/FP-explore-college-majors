8119786,4,B000FAIKQG,Excellent movie and one for the collection.,1427068800,,43,5.285714285714286
8119787,5,B000FAIKQG,"The movie itself is a must have for any Ti Lung fans. He gives a great performance in this story of a Sifu whom is being used in a long standing  feud between two clans. The video was crisp and clear with only one small part in which the audio glitched. The dvd arrived pristine. *Update, the shipper, Kung Fu Diva, sent me a replacement DVD. Great seller.",1410048000,,356,4.235294117647059
8119788,5,B000FAIKQG,"I saw this a LONG time ago in a galaxy far far away on USA kung fu theater as a kid. I've been trying to figure out the title for years and I was very happy to finally buy it on DVD. The picture quality is great considering the age of the film. The sound isn't the best but that's definitely forgivable all things considered although there was a constant hum that kind of got annoying after a while. Film wise, this movie is Kung Fu Theater at it's best! It has a great story, a teacher and apprentice relationship, a great training segment, good vs. evil, a really scary kicking butt long white haired crazy bad guy, and fighting with weapons! This is definitely one of the best, if not the best, kung fu theater classics. I absolutely recommend and hope you enjoy!",1405209600,,766,4.326388888888889
8119789,4,B000FAIKQG,"Shaw Brothers, director Sun Chung & Ti Lung knock one out of the park again.  Director Sun Chung may not have been as prolific as ""The Pops"" Lau Kar-Leung (Liu Chia-Liang) or ""The Maestro"" Chang Cheh, but he had a distinctive style all his own.

In 1978-9, Sun made three films at Shaw (that I know of), and I believe this was the first (before ""The Avenging Eagle"").  Plenty of familiar faces turn up in both movies; Ti Lung, Billy Tang, Dick Wei, Johnny Wang Lung-Wei, Yuen Wah (Bruce Lee's stunt double seven years earlier at Golden Harvest) and Ku Feng as the lead villain.  Instead of Fu Sheng, there's Wang Yue (not Jimmy Wang Yu) as Lung's co-star.

I'm not going to go into the plot because I don't particularly find those that interesting to read.  However, Tang Chia's choreography is stellar, Ti Lung looks awesome (check out his fight with Chiang Tao), Eddie H. Wang picks out great tracks from Shaws' music library, and Sun directs all this with aplomb.  There's great pole-fighting here, as well as some great hand-to-hand fu.

Okay, so this movie rocks.  When I received the DVD it was from Bonzai, fortunately, the cover stated ""digitally remastered and restored"".....and it is.  There's always some audio issues with Bonzai but not this time.  In case you're still wondering, this film is presented in Shawscope & remastered.  It's also dubbed in English (no Chinese audio or subtitles), but the dubbed voices are good here; those familiar ""Drive-In Movie"" voices (NY/NJ fans should understand).  An awesome purchase; if you like Shaw Brothers, Ti Lung and/or good martial arts action ~ you will like this movie, and the way Bonzai presents it.  That's my opinion, case closed.",1400284800,3,1694,4.8166089965397925
8119790,5,B000FAIKQG,"IF YOU ARE 55 AND OLDER AND LOVE THE OLD SCHOOL KUNG FU MOVIES,THIS IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS.
LUNG TI CREATED A NAME AS ONE LEADING EXPONENT OF THE SHAW BROTHERS STABLE OF TALENTED ACTORS.
IN THIS MOVIE HE IS A MASTER INSTRUCTOR (A ROLE HE PLAYED ON MANY MOVIES) THAT HAS HIGH MORAL AND VIRTUOUS VALUES HE IS TRICKED TO END UP WORKING FOR A CRIMINAL CLAN AS THEIR PERSONAL INSTRUCTOR TO LATER FIND THAT ALL THESE STUDENTS WERE CRIMINALS AND WANTED TO WIPE OUT THEIR RIVAL CLAN.
THE FIGHTS ARE EPIC AND HE FINDS ONE VIRTUOUS STUDENT IN RIVAL CLAN WITCH HE TAKES ON AS HIS ONLY TRUE DISCIPLE.
THE ENDING FIGHT IS AWESOME.
A MUST SEE AND HAVE FOR SERIOUS FU NUTS LIKE MY SELF. ENJOY",1379548800,,676,4.1679389312977095
8119791,5,B000FAIKQG,"The quality on the DVD  was great. And the sound qaulity is ok but its an old movie, what do you expect! Worth every penny!",1358121600,,123,3.92
8119792,4,B000FAIKQG,"If you're a fan of Kung Fu, then this is a movie for you.  Along with ""Avenging Eagle"" this is one of Ti Lung's best and I recommend it highly.  Action and drama combine for an exciting film experience and the final fight scene makes it well worth of the price of admission alone.",1329955200,,280,4.166666666666667
