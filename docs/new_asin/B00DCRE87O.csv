5790822,5,B00DCRE87O,"Love story and tale about about yearning for a simple life involving an uncompromising outdoorsman, his aristocratic wife, and his freedman lifelong pal.  Well told, great footage, beautiful scenery.  It's not quite as good as Legends of the Fall, but it's the same kind of movie, set in the South in the early 1900's.  Brought me to tears many times.",1377043200,19,351,4.816666666666666
5790823,3,B00DCRE87O,"The premise of this movie, in my opinion, is that utopias never last. Ward Allen was in his own utopia in the early years of the century as a hunter of ducks for market in Savannah, Georgia. Although he was Oxford educated from a family of means, he chose to live totally opposite the values of the rich. This movie is based on the true story of his life. His two close companions who helped fell and collect these ducks were a freed slave named Christmas, who lived to be 95, and a beautiful chocolate retriever named Rock. The movie was beautifully shot in Savannah, Georgia, with Jim Caviezel as Ward. He put his heart into the project with a well done portrayal.

The love developing between a privileged woman named Lucy and Ward seemed to be rushed. You see them making love on a hardwood floor (wow!), then quickly proceeding to be married. Lucy is then mortified to see her husband drunk either on a horse or in a bar (he loved whiskey). Check out how he sweet talks her to letting him back into the house. After more tumultuous activity between the two, he and Lucy discover they're to be parents, and tenderness develops between them. Unfortunately a tragedy happens; the utopia begins to crumble. One of the notable scenes for me was when he took Lucy back onto the river to an abandoned barge to have her hopefully feel life naturally although she was dead inside. Jim Caviezel knows how to cry.

With industrialization of the land, and laws forbidding shooting ducks, Ward and Christmas' lives are set adrift. I won't reveal how the movie proceeds towards conclusion. I just know that as an individual viewer, I was feeling sad, sorry for the lives I wish to know more about. I did not find out how Ward passed away, and what happened to Lucy. The book that the movie was based upon is apparently out of print; perhaps this movie will regenerate reprinting. The criticism I wish to make is about the chemistry between Caviezel and Jaimie Alexander who played Lucy. She seemed stiff; I don't know if it's because Lucy in history was this way or not, or if Alexander was directed this way. Caviezel's looks, gazes, and his eyes contained the chemistry. I will consider purchasing this DVD.",1377043200,19,2200,4.595419847328245
5790824,1,B00DCRE87O,"Why does a movie called "" Savannah "" show a graphic poster of a film about Iraq vets called "" Least Among Saints "" ????",1375401600,,119,3.8
5790825,3,B00DCRE87O,"Actor Jim Caviezel was the name that grabbed my attention and convinced me to pay to watch this movie when it appeared in the on demand menu of my television. I was pleasantly surprised to see that Sam Shepard and Hal Holbrook also had roles in this film. I viewed it on August 1 , 2013 even though I wasn't expecting it to be available yet.

The film, based on true events, focuses on the true story of Ward Allen, a highly educated man who turned his back on conventional life - and his inheritance - to live freely on the Savannah River, hunting ducks and avoiding many of the ""rules"" of so-called polite society. He is accompanied by his long time friend, Christmas Moultrie (Chiwetel Ejiofor).

Ward isn't afraid to offend those who try to get in his way, from government officials to the elite who think that duck hunting is a light diversion. His honest and open manner attracts the attention of a society woman, Lucy (Jaimie Alexander). She is equally out-spoken, somewhat impetuous, and willing to take risks. .

There were many sweet and charming moments in this film. But I have to admit it didn't wholly engage me. While Sam Shepard was in fine form, Caviezel didn't seem convincing as Ward Allen. I also didn't buy the love relationship between him and Lucy. There didn't seem to be enough chemistry there.
.
The film did make me want to know more about Ward Allen. Much of the movie is based on the research of John Cay and John Cay Jr. There are two editions of a book,  Ward Allen: Savannah River Market Hunter, one written by John Cay (1958) and the other with the author listed as John Cay Jr. (1959). I also discovered that Christmas Moultrie, Allen's companion on the river, was born a slave in 1859 (on Christmas Day) and died in April of 1957. I've heard that he had an autobiography out there but haven't found further information about that. The Georgia Historical Society lists an article, ""Ducks, Dogs, and Friends"" in its archives, in a folder which also contains a photo of Christmas Moultrie. The article was written by John Eugene Cay, Jr.",1375315200,30,2069,4.568733153638814

5790844,1,B00DCRE87O,"Perhaps one of the most boring movies known to man.  It takes a lot for me to be motivated (either positively or negatively) to post a movie review.  The characters are boring (though they're intended to be lovingly outlandish), the action and plot were almost non-existent.  The only way to make it more boring is to have more scenes in the old cabin with Christmas telling more stories.  Zzzzz... Oh sorry... I'm done.",1441152000,,420,4.712328767123288
5790845,4,B00DCRE87O,"I picked up this movie because of the cast... and they did not disappoint!  Based on a true story, this was a tale of a well educated man, and his friend, born a slave -- and frequently reminding his white friend, in his own little ways, that while they might live and work side by side, that did not mean they lived in the same world.

There was a moment when the white men was about to enter a doorway before his black friend and he stopped and stood aside so the black man could go before him, perhaps today that is meaningless, but when you consider that the event took place long before the black man died in his 90s in 1958 you begin to understand just how meaningful it must have been at the time.  (And given it was at a county courthouse where they were both about to appear before a judge I suspect it was a true event witnessed by many others, that set the town abuzz.)

That was just one of the dozens of moments in the movie that stood out, making me realize how much society has changed, for all that we wish it would change still more.",1438646400,,1050,4.132352941176471

5790876,1,B00DCRE87O,"Ouch.  Great cast - abysmal screen play.  This movie wandered aimlessly through 8 or 9 potential plot-lines and never squarely landed on any one.  It's as though the director never read the story.  Perhaps that is the problem in that it wasn't based on an actual book - but on memoirs.  Memoirs don't have a story-line and neither did this stinker.  Too bad - the character, the cast all could have made for a memorable film, but instead we are forced to witness nothing less than the random synaptic firings of someone who remembers bits and pieces of a local legend.  The cinematography is brilliant, albeit repetitive.  The setting is charming, but narrow (I know it's difficult to maintain historical accuracy in a movie like this); this movie suffers greatly from a constant narrow view of Savannah - like touring the town through binoculars.",1410307200,2,847,4.833333333333333

5790929,4,B00DCRE87O,"This is the true story of Ward Allen, a romantic and a highly educated man who rejected his plantation heritage for the freedom of life on a river. During the years after the turn of the last century, he teams up with an ex-slave and friend, Christmas Moultrie, to hunt ducks for a living on the Savannah River marshes. These were days when market hunting was legal and hunters could scratch out a living selling ducks to restaurants. Having duck hunted for most of my life and having come from a family of duck hunters, including a grandfather who was a market hunter, this film - which treats duck hunting much the same way ""A River Runs Through It"" treats fly fishing - was special to me. Starring one of my favorite actors, Jim Caviezel, as Ward Allen; Chiwetel Ejiofor, as Christmas Moultrie; and Jaimie Alexander, as Allen's wife, Lucy, the performances are all superb. The cinematography along the Savannah River marshes is breathtaking; and the music score, especially the use of old black spirituals, perfectly sets the mood. The film is not without its faults - primarily because it is a bit too ambitious in its scope - but on balance it is highly entertaining...especially if you have a hunting background.",1388275200,9,1218,4.75
5790930,5,B00DCRE87O,"A gentle, sweeping tale brought to life by an ensemble known for its performances more than its celebrity, Savannah presents the story of Ward Allen. Jim Caviezel turns in one of his strongest leading performances, genuinely seeming to have fun in the role of a larger than life Southern gent. Chiwetel Ejiofor, one of filmmaking's most underrated talents, is strong and steady in the role of Ward's sidekick, Christmas, aka ""The Mayor"" of Savannah. Their friendship is strengthened by their differences and the chemistry between the two actors was very credible and intriguing.

I had not been as much of a fan of Jaimie Alexander's work, yet I found myself appreciating her in this film. In terms of emotion, her character runs the gamut and it was refreshing to see her taking on a role of this nature as opposed to the numerous action-roles to her credit. At times she was remarkably haunting, which made her character even more watchable. Veterans like Hal Holbrook and Sam Shepherd pepper scenes with enough familiarity to keep the sometimes meandering story moving forward. This is a Southern tale, but one of great respect and humility. It neither boasts nor laments its place in history; rather, it simply carries the burden of the past as it attempts to make a new future.

Most interesting, to me, was the role Bradley Whitford portrayed. I hadn't made the connection until the end but I'm sure a keen moviegoer will admire the part he plays in the overall tale. The mystery of the story was particularly intriguing and, as may have been the point, inspires one to learn more about the true lives of these characters.

Definitely recommended.",1388102400,7,1653,4.875444839857651
5790931,5,B00DCRE87O,"The most interesting part about the movie was the relationship between the Jim Caviezel and Chiwetel Ejiofor characters.  They were true friends during that period of time and wasn't ashamed.  Seemed to me more like brothers than friends.  Liked the way the two communicated; I feel these actors made their characters come alive.  The Christmas character finally calls Ward by his first name indicating the friendship he really felt.  Also, I liked the statement Christmas made and it was something like your world is not mine which seemed to initially have an effect but was brushed off.  Their characters should have been more developed for that storyline was extremely good.  I also gathered the Christmas character was also extremely intelligent but without the education his friend had (more signs of the times).  Gave 5 stars because of the friendship the two shared, how it was portrayed (acting abilities), etc.  Purchased the movie after streaming from Netflix and am glad I did.",1386720000,2,988,5.086956521739131
5790932,5,B00DCRE87O,"Jim Caviezel lets loose here in ""Savannah,"" embracing the bigger than life persona of Ward Allen, an Oxford educated man who decided to forgo his inheritance in favor of a much simpler life as a hunter and outdoors man.  He spends his days with his friend and former slave Christmas Moultrie on the river hunting for ducks, which is the only place he feels at home.

Off the river, Allen has a hard time with the stuffed shirts who view him as an oddity.  He often runs into trouble with the law for bringing in more than the ""legal"" amount of foul and is usually let off the hook by an understanding judge who is amused by his wit and passion.  His wife, who comes from a wealthy family, falls for his over the top personality then has trouble with it once they are married.

The story jumps back and forth in time using flashbacks, which I think took a bit away from the flow of the movie.  In the end though it is still a nice departure from a lot of the movies being made today.  It's nice to see a movie that can tell a story without computer generated graphics and car chases.  I'd highly recommend ""Savannah"" to anyone who loves a good story.",1385251200,3,1149,4.287037037037037

Love anything with Jim Caviezel in it!",1384819200,,122,5.1
5790934,5,B00DCRE87O,"I'm a fan of Jim Caviezel--but in this one he does a completely new side of himself that he has not done in any of his other movies. As far as I'm concerned, in this one he proves that he is truly a great actor!!  I've read some reviews that say the movie was not well-acted, but you can certainly not say that about Caviezel! He seemed to BE Ward Allen, which is what a good actor does.  I had pre-ordered the DVD and have already ordered a spare-just in case. Amazon will  always be my go-to place for DVDs.",1383177600,,509,4.07
5790935,5,B00DCRE87O,this film was an experience. I would highly recommend this to people who want to take a journey within the film. very moving. the character ward allen paralled my life. the situations and feeling he experienced I could relate to on a humanistic and spiritual level.  I was touched to my core as I watched this film. Jim Caviezel became ward allen.  if ward allen were alive today I believe he would be proud of how Jim portrayed him.,1382918400,,433,4.468354430379747

5790948,5,B00DCRE87O,No wonder it was held over for a number of weeks in Georga! The story was extremely heart wrenching! I am a big fan of Jim Caviezel. He truly outdid himself! I ordered the DVD from Amazon far in advance-the wait was well worth it.,1381622400,5,230,4.133333333333334
5790949,3,B00DCRE87O,Movie was ok. It was slow and I didn't think that it was directed very well. This could have been so much more.,1380499200,,111,3.869565217391304
5790950,5,B00DCRE87O,"This truly is a wonderful movie. It captured me from beginning to the end. Glad I didn't pay attention to the critics. Pretty certain if it had a wider release not just in the southern regions, it would have been a huge success!  Jim Caviezel is absolutely one of the best actors now and hopefully will receive the recognition of his outstanding work. I saw the movie twice and will purchase the DVD.  Haywood-Carter did a brilliant directing job; great job of Sam Sheppard; legendary Hal Holbrook; fantastic Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jaimie Alexander a perfect Lucy Stubbs.",1379808000,5,569,4.855670103092783

5790952,5,B00DCRE87O,This movie is beautifully filmed highlighting the magic of the marshes and rivers of Savannah. If you are a New York critic that has never been in the outdoors and doesn't believe a film should be viewed and enjoyed by all ages then it might not be the film for you. I recommend you go see this movie and just sit back and enjoy a story from a time of the past. If you have ever visited or think of visiting Savannah it is a must watch. I have seen this movie and plan on buying it when it is available.,1379030400,,503,3.99009900990099

5790954,5,B00DCRE87O,"I was lucky enough to first see this great movie at the Charleston Film Festival in March 2013.  I was completely entranced with it.  The setting was my hometown which is what originally caught me eye.  Finding out that the lead was played by Jim Caviezel from Person of Interest on CBS drew me in.  Having read that this role was completely different from his other roles, I knew I had to see it.  The crowd seemed to enjoy the movie and a standing ovation was given the director who was in attendance.  She was present for a Q&A and seems to still hold this movie close to her heart, and it had been filmed 2 years earlier!

I attended the Savannah premier in August.  It was a packed house.  Since I'd seen the movie once, I was able to watch & observe the other patrons to check their reactions.  Everyone laughed at all the right places, clapped in the right places and there were certainly many wiping away tears at the end.  At the end of the movie the entire audience applauded loudly and for a lengthy period of time.  Since most people in attendence were FROM Savannah....that was high praise indeed.

I have pre-ordered my copy and can't wait to get it.  Jim Caviezel did a very good job with his southern accent.  I felt it was a little more like the accents in Charleston than Savannah, which may be because the director was from Charleston.  Caviezel is known for his strong dramatic roles and this was quite a departure for him.  Ward Allen was a scallywag and Caviezel played that to the max.  He was smug when he needed to be, flippant when he had to be and intensely earnest when it was called for.  You felt like he was a man you would like to call friend.

The relationship between Allen and Christmas Moultrie was well written and well acted.  Strong friendships between a white man and a black man in the early 20th century was rare.  Between an aristocrat and a freed slave was even more rare.  Chiwetel Ejiofor & Jim Caviezel meshed well as close friends who loved and respected each other.  The care and compassion that Christmas showed toward Allen in the end brought tears to my eyes.

I felt that there WAS chemistry between Jaimie Alexander and Jim Caviezel.  They are two very different styled actors, playing very much against type.  Their differences were believable.  The attraction and love for each other was palatable.  They were far apart in temperment but their love kept them together.  The love scenes were perfect.....because they were that............LOVE SCENES.......not sex scenes.  You could imagine what went on behind the closed door.

I have recommended this movie to all my friends and even my customers at work.  It is a little movie that could and did.",1378944000,14,2704,4.578288100208768
5790955,5,B00DCRE87O,"I've lived in the South since 1957, after earlier years as an Army brat.  The South's heritage for storytelling is rich, and the movie Savannah is about that storytelling.  The South's heritage for hunting, a necessity for most families since Europeans first immigrated, is also multi-layer and rich and the movie Savannah is about that hunting culture.  The South is and always has been a complicated place for race relations and both Driving Miss Daisy and Savannah show some of those complexities.  The city of Savannah and the surrounding marshes are extraordinarily beautiful - and Savannah the movie shows us that beauty in depth and breadth.
I love this movie.  I will admit prejudice since my brother and his wife were co-writers and she directed.  I am happy for them to have help create such a beautiful movie for the big screen!  But it didn't take that family connection for me to love the movie - I love the South and Savannah expresses the South so well!",1378944000,3,968,4.7604790419161676
5790956,5,B00DCRE87O,"I know I'm partial to Jim (who doesn't love him?) but he takes on this character with the skill and knowledge of the man himself who he plays that you can't tell where Jim Caviezel begins and Ward Allen ends.  They appear to be one in the same, both in their natural element.  I think Mr. Allen would be proud.
If you love stories based on fact, then this is yet another excellent film Jim portrays so deftly, I think these types are his forte.  He's doing what Jimmy Stewart told him to do - 'make good movies'.",1378771200,4,512,4.204081632653061
5790957,5,B00DCRE87O,"I completely agree with the person who wondered why this is not being shown in theaters. I saw Savannah on ""On Demand"" on my TV and I feel a great injustice has been done to movie-goers by not letting them witness the outstanding performances of Jim Caviezel as Ward Allen, and Chiwetel Ejiofor as his companion, Christmas.  I can just imagine the beautiful scenery of Savannah, GA on the big screens of theaters.  It's beyond me why they show some of the 'stuff' that you see in theaters, and send a great movie like SAVANNAH straight to DVD...not right.:(",1378684800,46,557,4.616161616161616
5790958,5,B00DCRE87O,"It is indeed rare these days to view such a topically complex film and be led near seamlessly in and out of the issues of racial relations, addiction, abuse and class distinction .At the same time we are witnessing the transition from an era where harvesting waterfowl as a commercial enterprise to sate the appetite of the public during that period in history to a precursor of today's hunting standards and morality. While the acting s a little rough, it somehow befits the period and therefore works. It is an excellent caricature of a man an his friend trying to understand a tidal wave of change to their ways of living and ending in sad acceptance by one and the ultimate rejection by the man who in the finale simply runs out of life.",1378598400,,741,4.537313432835821

5790960,5,B00DCRE87O,"I've always enjoyed how easy Jim Caviezel makes acting look, but he really BECOMES Ward Allen in ""Savannah""! This is worth watching just for the cinematography, but you will become enamored with Ward Allen, Christmas and many of the other characters. Hal Holbrook is great as the somewhat crazy judge who is always letting Ward off the hook for his constant violations of the law. I recommend this film for teens and older audiences, who will probably want to watch more than once.",1378166400,,481,4.807228915662651
5790961,4,B00DCRE87O,"This is a little gem of a movie.  Stunning scenery and excellent acting.  I will say, as a disclaimer, that if you aren't familiar with Savannah, you might not be as taken with it as I was personally.  It is the story of Ward Allen from a wealthy Savannah family who kicks over the traces and simply enjoys duck hunting on the Savannah River with his friend, Christmas Moutrie, a freed black who was the last black to be born on Mulberry Plantation.  James Caveziel is excellent as the charismatic Allen who can spout Shakespeare for he was well-educated at Eton, etc. and charm the judge, played by Hal Holbrook, into freeing him for his many rather unlawful  feats of derring do.  Christmas acts as Ward's conscience and steadying factor throughout the movie.
It is true that the love story between Ward and Lucy tends to be a bit vague.  He obviously loved her but his ego and yes his selfishness to lead his own life his own way set the stage for tragedy between the two.  By the way, the part of Lucy's father is well played by Sam Shepard.

A nice touch was the gift of a pen Lucy gives Ward after a 10-day stay in prison for shooting the eyes out of Lucy's portrait.  This launches Ward's writing prowess and his articles in the ""Savannah Morning News.""

 This is just a good movie to see to let the beautiful scenery sweep away your cares for about two hours.  And, living here in Savannah, I could also feel a bit of a kinship with Ward Allen  as he sees his beloved river being commercialized and government regulations hampering his duck hunting.  Later, Christmas learns he must move from his little cottage when the plantation land is taken for other pursuits.  In other words...sometimes...""The world is Too Much With Us.""

(And for those who can't figure out how he died, connect the scene when Lucy finds out Ward can't swim after he falls out of the boat they're in and then the very last scene when he stands at the front of his boat, arms raised to the sky.)",1377993600,4,1977,4.447222222222222

5790964,3,B00DCRE87O,"This was a wonderful showcase for the many talents of Jim Caviezel, a little singing, a little crying, and playing a rather flamboyant naturalist seemed to fit his broad scope of abilities. Chiwetal Ejiofor was excellent as Moultry and the interplay of the two men was incredible.  The scenery was breathtaking!  The editing was horrible.  This had the earmarks of a really fine movie if the editing had been better.  It was often hard to follow time progression.  For instance, Ward Allen (Jim Caviezel) is making love to his future wife, in the next scene marrying her,then she is pregnant...but how much time passes between these incidents seems unclear.  Later when Ward's wife becomes ill and Ward sells everything to take care of her, there seems to be a break down again in time between her hospitalization and his death.  I really looked forward to this movie being released when I read the background story some months ago.  I thought it sounded like a great platform which might bring an Oscar to Jim who was overlooked when he did such a wonderful job in The Passion of Christ.  However, the editing of Svannah may steal away that possibility. Too bad!",1377561600,3,1163,4.775

Someone else wrote that Caviezel and Alexander did not have good chemistry. Just because there was not a gratuitous sex scene with buns bouncing up and down, does not mean that there was not chemistry.  I was able to get a very clear understanding of their love and passion for each other and I thought the actors had fantastic chemistry, particularly in the intimate scenes.
It was BEAUTIFULLY filmed. Cinematography captured the essence of the outdoor scenes. I could almost smell the marshes and feel the humid breeze.
I would recommend this movie.  It definitely was not boring. Yet, it was not so heart wrenching that I couldn't sleep later. All in all, a very enjoyable use of my Sunday afternoon.",1377388800,31,846,4.895104895104895
