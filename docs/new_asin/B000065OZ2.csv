1707541,5,B000065OZ2,"Anne of Green Gables is a Classic story that every home should have in its video library. It follows the life experience of Anne Shirley, a teenage orphan sent to a family in Prince Edward Island, an island off the east coast of Canada. The scenes are beautiful. The action is similar to Little House on the Prairie. Anne possesses an excellent grasp of English and tends to eloquently over-dramatize what she describes.

There is nothing negative about this series. The trilogy allows you to follow her through her maturing years. When you reach the closing credits, you will be sad the series is over.",1518912000,,603,4.742857142857143

1707552,2,B000065OZ2,"I had just watched my VHS copy of the original, so I can only speak to the sequel and the 3rd DVD. All 3 dvds are double sided. It's VERY hard to read which is side 1 and which is 2. I had never seen the Continuing Story before. My daughter and I watched side 2 first because it was marked incorrectly as side 1. We watched the whole side and then realized the issue. Quite annoying since it made no sense and ruined the experience for us. Both the sequel and 3rd had a couple spots that would stick. The 3rd DVD was the worst, but we ffwd thru those. I wouldn't recommend these. Heed the warnings of others, unless you don't mind the imperfections I described. I could've handled them better at a $15 price point, but for $40 i expected good dvds.",1517788800,13,748,4.165517241379311

The VHS tapes were terrible quality, but I love this version of Anne of Green Gables so much that I watched them anyway.

Because of the ages of the principal actors,  it would have made more sense to follow Montgomery's books and have the Blythe's children go off to war and follow Anne and Gil's lives as they had to live through it.  It was such a deviation from the original stories,  and I couldn't get behind it.  I didn't like the inappropriateness of Anne's relationship with Jack Garrison or even the suggestion of it with Fred Wright.  Gilbert wasn't in much of the movie.  I truly despised much of this movie, especially when Anne gives up Green Gables at the end.  But I will always treasure the first two,  and I'll always wish they'd finished the second film with Anne and Gil's wedding.",1483833600,,726,4.480916030534351

1707764,3,B000065OZ2,"Annoying version requires you to sit through 5 minutes of previews and ads before even getting to the main disc menu EVERY time you put it in.

The producers of this product have locked the skip feature so pushing the menu button or even Stop-Stop-Play does not get you to the movie you paid for.  You are forced to endure their ads for 5 minutes before watching your own movie you paid for.  Perhaps if you have a computer and can rip the movies from the disc this wouldn't be such an annoyance.

I grew up reading and watching Anne of Green Gables, having ""Anne"" themed parties and wanderings, so it pains me greatly to give such a low starred review. I could deal with lower quality imaging and audio, but unfortunately, side b of the second disk does not even play, so I can not watch the end of the story!
There is no option to watch these movies online and to have such limited options of quality and availability, certainly does limit the audience for these films. I understand if Sullivan Entertainment does not have the resources to enhance the quality and to provide a streaming option online, but could they consider letting another company possibly do this work for them? I will be writing to them directly, but wanted to also share these thoughts online, for other lovers of Megan Follows as Anne of Green Gables, considering purchasing these lovely films. I recommend writing to Sullivan Entertainment, rather than buying this set, with the proposal of an online streaming option and for guaranteed quality of DVD's for continuing generations.",1459814400,,1307,4.865470852017937

Movies 1 and 2 are pure magic. They're lovely. They're wonderful. They allow a person to get swept away in everything that is good and true about L.M. Montgomery's books. They're my first pic when I am at home and sick and want to rest and enjoy.

It completely ignores the wonderful life Montgomery created for Anne and Gilbert in favor of sensationalist crap that is totally unviewable.

I thought maybe it was my DVD player so I went out and got a new one (mine was pretty old) and the played just fine and I was quite happy about it. Pulled the second movie out of the case that they all three come in and it was damaged. It was like someone took a box knife to the spine and cut it halfway up. I thought ok..as long as the movie plays fine the case I can replace. Started watching the second movie and side one was fine, flipped it over and started playing side 2....then with about 30 min left in the movie...it started skipping real bad and then just froze and would not play anymore.

The box says it includes missing episodes but when the menu came up, there were no options for missing episodes - like Marilla's death, as it claims on the box. Even so, if there had been, we could not get the DVD to play at all past the menu - and even the menu page was ""broken"" by some black boxes appearing over part of it. I do not believe that the blue set is put out by Sullivan, but rather a cheap copy. Update: the original set in the white box from Sullivan Entertainment is now available from their website for $32.

I'm very sorry to say the second disc does NOT play at all..It just shows the picture and stops...I tried both sides and they just don't play..I haven't tried to even  open the 3rd disc.. I think Amazon should back this up as $50 for something that doesn't work is a shame. And after reading other results of people that bought this item it appears that this item is really defective...It isn't a matter of just returning the item, the item does NOT work....They are asking for stars for this item, I'd give it a minus 5 stars....I don't know if Amazon reads these reviews or not, but folks I wouldn't buy this item as it appears to be defective...and yes Amazon tells me it is to late to return it....even tho it is defective.....",1434758400,4,900,4.389221556886228

1708211,2,B000065OZ2,"This review is not to review the quality of the discs which to me were quite good but to tell of the tremendous disappointment with much of their content. The publisher has taken great liberty in destroying Anne of Green Gables by adding false details especially in the third called ""The Continuing Story"". It is none other than blatant war propaganda to prop up the saging military industrial complex by fabricating a lie that Anne went to France during WWI to find Dr. Blythe and ended up adopting a boy baby orphaned by his deceased parents. I was shocked!

I read in Wikipedia that this was such a scandalous issue that many of the actors later reprised this adding of the false and fraudulent material into the screenplay called Anne of Green Gables of 1985. So much of the entire book was torn apart and rewritten. I am very surprised that Sullivan Publishing isn't sued over their blantant misuse of this magnificent six-book series by L.M. Montgomery of Canada. Her books cannot be rivalled not even by Louisa May Alcott. She is by far the greatest children's fiction writer that even held a pen. There isn't much more I can do but to admonish ALL who have viewed this falsified war story to write the pubishers and protest what they have done to these great historical fiction books. I myself will be addressing a scathing letter to them to let them know my feelings and thoughts regarding this matter. There should be a law against taking great author's books and stories and totally changing them to suit their own greedy interests.  They did a fairly good job with the first two films but totally ruined the set by adding the war portion which is false.

Wikipedia quote:  ""The Continuing Story was criticized principally because unlike the 1985 Anne of Green Gables and its 1987 sequel Anne of Avonlea, the screenplay was NOT based upon Montgomery's works, but instead used Montgomery's much-loved characters in a largely original World War I story by Sullivan and Laurie Pearson. Montgomery had written an Anne novel set in that same period, Rilla of Ingleside, a story focusing on Anne's youngest daughter, and in which Anne was a mother whose three sons were fighting in Europe"".",1426896000,2,2195,4.768421052631579

1708508,5,B000065OZ2,"I feel very lucky to own the Trilogy Box set of these wonderful movies and it's all thanks to my wonderful friend Shelly and the gift card she gave me for Christmas. In general the whole Anne Of Green Gable series starts off with a young orphan sent to Prince Edward Island Canada to live with a Mattew and Marilla Cuthbert who were wanting a boy to help them out on the farm where they lived and ended up getting a girl instead,but in the end she won everyone's heart especially Mattew's and got to stay. The best dvd in the series is the first one she makes all kinds of mistakes like breaking a chalkboard over a boy who teased her and got her upset,fell off a roof,got her friend Diana drunk and more. In the other two dvds actually in all of them basically talks about how Anne grow up starting at age 12. Even when Anne was not in Canada she always felt the need to go back there and in the end she did. The video series includes two weddings a friend of hers as,well as her own. Meagan Follows is Anne and she does a really great job.",1415923200,,1041,4.1330049261083746

1708539,5,B000065OZ2,"Had these on VHS that had been recorded from the Disney Channel for many years, Then one Christmas about 8-9 years ago my mother sent them to me, on pre-recorded VHS video tape consisting of 2 VHS tapes per movie as ""Anne of Green Gables"" is 3 hours 15 minutes, ""Anne of Green Gables the Sequel"" is 3 hours 52 Minutes, and ""Anne of Green Gables the Continuing Story"" is 3 hour 5 minutes. Then I spied them here on Amazon around 2012-1014 can't remember, and for some reason there is no record that I purchased them here but I did, I have not purchase DVD's in the local stores for the past 3 years due to the availability here on Amazon. Had to learn the hard way to wait for them to come in the mail. That being said Anne of Green Gables is absolutely the best and on my 55"" Mitsubishi 1080i they look very good. Mine are on 3 double sided dvd's and the box looks like the picture on this review with out the the ""Trilogy"" words on the box, If your looking for what I have that came in the box look at the (3) Anne of Green Gables individual selections and that is what you will be getting. The stories are all there and intact. From the box QUOTE: ""All 3 classic Mini-Series contain, Full Length Audio Commentary Tracks by Director's Kevin Sullivan and Stefan Scaini"" PLUS THESE EXTRAORDINARY SPECIAL FEATURES: Missing Scenes, Lost Footage, Behind the Scenes Video, Special Effects, WWI Historical Commentary by Kevin Sullivan, ""Marilla Cuthbert's Death"": The Missing Green Gables Episode, Cast and Crew Biographies."" UNQUOTE. If family movies are what your all about then you just cannot afford to miss these movies. Anne of Green Gables collection will have you laughing, crying, and pulling for Anne Shirley all along the way, of course we can not for get Anne's Passion for Gilbert. Isn't about time to set your little ones down to a real down to earth movie, a truly engineered family movie that will have you coming back for more. These stories will never get old, just better with time.",1414540800,2,1995,4.513812154696133

1708665,5,B000065OZ2,"I loved the Anne of Green Gables movies as a little girl and thought it would be nice to watch them again after all these years. I'm 34 now, and Anne Shirley still makes me smile with her poetic romanticism and stubbornness! Some other reviewers complained about it being low TV quality, but I don't see the problem. It looks just fine to me, but then again I wasn't expecting a high definition remaster.  These movies are like a cozy blanket on a rainy day. I recommend for any little girl because Anne's a positive role model, and it's a great story about growing up and becoming a strong, smart, and kind hearted woman.",1408924800,5,622,4.456140350877193

Our waitress at a local restaurant...a former student... stopped and quizzed me about her favorite movie of all time but couldn't remember the title.  I gave her the set and she gathered her entire family to watch and they loved it.  Charming, funny; heart wrenching at times it is the story of an orphan girl that thinks of herself as the ugly swan; growing into a strong lovely young woman and all the adventures along the way.",1408838400,,551,4.5353535353535355

These are my favorite movies and there's no better way than being able to watch them wherever on DVD. Even my friend borrows them alot and she has the DVR set.

1708734,3,B000065OZ2,The first 2 DVDs were great -- I had actually seen both but on VHSs so we were thrilled with the high quality of the new DVDs.  The 3rd DVD was VERY disappointing since it had NO history from any of Lucy Montgomery books.  It was a totally new story.  It made it even more frustrating because Anne and Gilbert (as well as others) were from the original cast and it could have been a very special sequel. The story was very unrealistic.  Gilbert and Anne were made up to look much older than they would have been.  They even had different accents.  We gave away the 3rd DVD but probably got a good value just the same vs buying the first two separately.,1402272000,2,652,4.217741935483871

It is definitely one of the greatest movies of all time. The company I ordered it from delivered it fast and safely to me.

The evolution of the main characters' relationships is so interesting.  The trilogy has adventure, drama, joy, and yes, sorrow.  Some parts made me cry but depicted the realities of life.

When Anne of Green Gables appeared not too long ago on cable, I learned that my husband loves the series as much as I do, so I thought the Trilogy Box Set would make the perfect gift to him for Father's Day.",1401494400,,566,4.519607843137255

The story too heartwarming to stop.  The characters so loveable, you feel like you  know them.

It does not follow the actual story at all; the time and settings are totally off and characters are changed quite a lot. I don't mind minor adjustments as you see in the first two movies (where several books are combined or adjusted to fit them into a movie), but I do take issue with major character changes.  Diana, for example, is altered from a down to earth farmer's wife with lots of children (in the books) to a superficial, wealthy lady.

I was so excited when I found the DVDs could be purchased, and I had never seen ""Anne of Green Gables, the Continuing Story.""  The DVDs each have their own case.  The quality is just okay, it needs to be seriously remastered, it kind of looks like the someone recorded it when it was on TV onto a VHS.  It's grainy, and you have to turn the sound way up to hear the dialogue.  Also each DVD is double-sided, which I hate, because who wants to get up in the middle of the movie to flip the disk (especially if you are sick)?  We have means to do so much with technology these days, but we can't put a longer movie on one side of a disk?  The story is great, and it served it's purpose, I still put in the player when I am sad or having a sick day.

I highly recommend these movies, but save your money for the remastered version they have out.",1377648000,,1011,4.015

""What we have once enjoyed we can never lose. All that we love deeply becomes a part of us."" - Helen Keller

My mother who (would be 107 years old if she were alive today) had great literary taste. As a young girl, She loved the Anne of Green Gables books. This and the following review tells us how TIMELESS the books and the television series are:

104 of 104 people found the following review helpful
5.0 out of 5 stars The most wonderful books in the world, October 22, 1999
By Heather

""When I was in high school I was a mean, black leather wearing, heavy metal girl. A long time friend forced me against my will to read the first ""Anne"" book and my life has been so much more beautiful ever since. These books made me see the magical beauty in nature, bosom friends, family, imagination, and even crabby old ladies (this last has come in handy on many occasions). I now have made a point of buying the set for every girl I consider a friend. I am now 23, and when I have children of my own, girls or boys, I will read them ""Anne"" as soon as they can understand what I am saying.""

There isn't much of endearing value in the modern media today but Anne of Green Gables is a rare exception. It is so good, so captivating, so enchanting, and so pure that it makes me want to through a cover over all that is crude, obscene,  and vulgar.

As I reflect upon my own life of 79 years, I realize that all I am and all I ever hope to be was determined by the books, television, and motion pictures that I loved. Every person that has lived should make Anne of Green Gables a part of their life.

See all of my Reviews. I write only about books, events, or motion pictures that have changed the course of history or unforgettable books or motion pictures that will totally change peoples lives.

The probability of her european travels during a time of war doesn't seem realistic to me.  However, I do like to have the set and real life never stays the same and definitely isn't always delightful.  We must grow up and take it as it comes, war and all.

Also, in order to watch the movies you have to flip them over in the middle, so in case you didn't know that. Each disc has two sides, the first half of the movie and then the second half is on the back. This irratated me, but my mother doesn't mind at all.

While they had asked the orphanage for a boy who could help the man with his farm chores, they get Anne instead.  She worms her way into their hearts as well as into the hearts of many other people she meets.  Violence is only in the WWI segment.  There is no bad language.

It is not in typical DVD quality. There are no subtitles or anything, which doesn't bother me but would for someone deaf. My least favorite and most annoying gripe about this set is that the DVDs are two sided!! I thought we did away with that after cassette tapes? Even a VHS tape doesn't have to be flipped over. It is very annoying and when side 1 is down facing the player, it is actually side 2. This really does make Sullivan entertainment or whoever created these discs look like incompetent imbeciles stuck in the 1980's.",1364688000,3,685,4.488

One dvid does not play on one-side.  All the others work okay.  The date to return the product is passed.

Could not help but think that the very last disc took too much liberty in getting away from the book.  I was sorry that they did not follow the book closer on that disc.  The rest was good and was close to the Anne Books.  I am a great fan of Anne of Green Gables and all the Anne books that follow.  I laugh and cry when I read them.  I found that the dvd's made me laugh and cry as well.  Lucy Maud Montgomery is such an exceptional author.  Wish the last disc could have been different.

1709291,1,B000065OZ2,"So based on the 1 or even 2 star ratings by others, I am hesitant to purchase this boxed set. I won't regret it now by not buying it because DVDs should never have that problem. We've had DVDs for like what? Almost 20 years? But to have them be not very functional is just ridiculous. Seriously, if they are going to continue producing these, at least maybe go back to VHS since someone's already mentioned that those still somehow have higher quality.

I like old fashioned movies and loved that she didn't let life turn her into a sour person. She is full of spunk and came up with clever comebacks for those who always tried to bring her down with smart remarks.  I am also a sap for love storys and this was a edge of your seat kind of romantic love story. She has a nack for trouble making it funny and interesting.  I have watched it when I am a Hunters widow as they say and now that my mom is gone it reminds me how that is something we had in commen.

1709393,4,B000065OZ2,"I have seen a lot of complaints in regards to the quality of the Dvds.

Now, this is a made for TV series filmed in the 80s. It has developed a sort of cult following, but let's be honest; this isn't a Hollywood blockbuster. The box reads that the picture has been digitally restored. What most people don't realize is how expensive it is to do a digital restoration and what a digital restoration includes at the bare minimum. Digital restoration of the picture means that lighting issues, color issues, and flaws in the film are usually adjusted/fixed so that the quality is higher than the original format release, and these dvds are certainly higher quality than the VHS tapes are. The audio is not reported to have been restored, and I doubt that much was adjusted for the release of this box set.

The colors are vibrant and the quality is pretty decent. The biggest flaws with this set: no closed captions or subtitles and there are no scene selections on the dvd menu. There ARE chapters that you can skip through, but there is not an option to select a specific scene from the menu.

Otherwise, it was a good purchase. I paid $50 for the set, and these are replacing my degrading VHS tape sets. I do not regret the purchase because the quality is better than watching VHS.",1339891200,7,1281,4.512931034482759

I first watched her as a child with my Nanna (and my mum is named after her) and as with many Anne fans i have taken her into my heart and have truely loved her since the first time i watched the stories.  As a teenager i watched the VHS copy i had over and over again but sadly have not seen it for some time since video is no longer.  My mum bought the Triology box set for me for christmas and as you can imagine i was 'wild with delight', however like a few others have commented my DVD's have not lived up to expectation.  Although i did not find a problem with the quality as some have, i did find that all of a sudden the DVD would skip, then freeze and then just stop and switch off and so i have missed sections at the end of each DVD.

First off, there's the cheap cardboard packaging it arrives in. The DVDs come completely unadorned & the menu screens are super amateur looking (yes, for this price you deserve a pretty disc!) I popped it in & thought, ""so much for digitally remastered"" (more like lack of). The picture was just grainy & awful. Then to top it off, disc #2 skipped, or just outright stopped at parts. By the last few precious moments it just died on me.  At first I was willing to accept a replacement, but then changed my mind & have asked for a refund instead.

1709611,4,B000065OZ2,"I would REALLY REALLY like to order this trilogy on DVD but I was wondering if anyone could tell me if the dvd format is in wide screen or full screen???

Most dvd's now only come in wide screen (for those of us that have regular tvs, I'm refering to how the picture only shows in the middle of the tv screen and above and below the picture is blacked out. I guess to give it that movie theatre feel).I would like to order this so desperatley for me and my grandmother to watch together on Christmas, but she always finds the wide screen kind of annoying because she feels she's watching the movie through a tunnel. If this is a widescreen format I suppose I could order the VHS but I would prefer not to because DVDs tend to last longer. If someone could help me with this, that would be so deeply appreciated!!

And just to piggyback on other comments, Anne of Green Gables is probably my absolute favorite film of all time. I remember the first time I saw it on tv I thought oh no, I hate these movies!! But it wasn't 5 mintues before I was COMPLETELY submerged in Anne, Marilla, Mathew, Gil, Diana, and even the people you kind of love to hate like Rachel Lynn, Josie Pie, Mrs. Berry (Diana's mom).  That was several years ago and I've been hooked ever since! You know a movie is important when after watching it, you feel like a better person; that you can apply the things you've learned with and through these characters to your own life. I do have to admit, the only thing don't like about watching the series is that you become so invested in the story, the characters, and the lessons learned that when its over, its almost disappointing and a little sad that that the world we live in today is not filled with the same values, and morals that are displayed in the movie. Nonetheless, my all time favorite!!",1260662400,,1817,4.338235294117647

You can't help but fall in love with the charming character, Anne Shirley, played by the beautiful and talented, Megan Follows. Although she is really sixteen in the movie, Follows plays a twelve-year old talkative girl, but grows up so much in each sequel - both in real time and fictionally.

Despite her personal adversities along the way, she always manages to remain hopeful, strong, assertive, persistent, and courageous, as well as proud - which can be seen as both charming and comical.

Great for all ages - a truly incredible classic for the whole family to enjoy; to cry, laugh and grow with Anne Shirley of Green Gables.

The first two movies are quite true to the spirit of the books by Lucy Maude Montgomery and are two of the best movies ever made.

However, my daughter and I were both so very disappointed with the third movie in the series.  It is not based on any of L.M. Montgomery's stories, and the plot is so convoluted and impossible that I had a hard time even finishing the movie.  Jonathan Crombie is not even in the movie all that much.  The movie has Anne following him to Europe while he is serving as a doctor in the Canadian Army.  So many unbelievable things happen to Anne while she is there, such as ""happening"" to run into several people she knows from home, it just does not make for a believable story.  And, the story is really serious and heavy, while the books and first two movies are fun and lighthearted, even when dealing with serious issues.

I so loved the books in this series, and would love to see another movie made of the series.  Why couldn't the screenwriters have used ""Anne's House of Dreams"" and further stories for a basis for the next script??  Of course, Megan Fellows is too old now to play a young wife and mother, but I'm sure another fine actress would love the chance to play in a high quality movie.  I am very disappointed in Sullivan Entertainment for such a poor story, especially when such great material was available in the rest of the series.",1255996800,,1601,4.408163265306122

1709648,5,B000065OZ2,"Waited a long time to purchase this set, because of the price. Thank you Amazon for providing vendors who compete in price and quality.

I remember watching Anne of Green Gables when it was on PBS, when each segment was on a week-by-week schedule, torment waiting 7 days to watch the next story one hour at a time.  I read the books in between because the suspense was too much and was captivated by L.M. Montgomery, the author.

I've spent the last 5 days watching the dvd trilogy, remembering Anne's antics, allowing her to get on my nerves; funny how you view a movie in different stages of your life and relate to it in a new way.

This really is a beautiful love story and I thank Kevin Sullivan for maintaining all of the same actors throughout the trilogy.  That is what makes it very special.  Thank you Megan Follows and Jonathan Crombie for allowing 'The Continuing Story' be the closure for us in Anne and Gilbert's life by your maintaining continuity and making the story(s) believable as the viewer watches you grow and mature.

So much in life does not stay the same, no matter how much we wish it could.  L.M. Montgomery did not include a war in her books, however it is important as it shows the viewer that life isn't to be lived behind rose-colored glasses.  Anne and Gil are shell shocked through the ravages of the war, yet one thing remains constant, their love for one another.  The final story does not end with a kiss, a hug or a fade out.  The Trilogy ends as Ms. Montgomery would have ended it--with the viewer knowing that the only thing that matters to Anne and Gil is that they are together and that is enough for them.",1247529600,,1648,4.423841059602649

She was so enraptured by the series, I purchased it and gave it to her for Valentine's Day 2009!  She was thrilled! And next thing you know, she's ""twisting my arm"" to watch it with her.  I reluctantly agreed to watch one episode with her just to appease her...well, you know what happened.  I too got hooked and ended up watching the entire series.

1709679,5,B000065OZ2,"When you watch these movies which are approximately 3 hours each, you can really get a sense for how rich and full of details L.M. Montgomery's books really are!

I started watching the Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Green Gables the Sequel years ago on PBS.  They are amazing and there couldn't be a better actress than Meagan Follows to play Anne.  All three movies have the same actors, which is wonderful.  All three are wonderful, family friendly movies that will keep your family of all ages entertained and fascinated.

I used the title Anne-esque because if you are a fan of Lucy Maud Montgomery's books as I am you will notice right away that the many, many stories in the books of Anne's childhood are compressed, re-organized, and some left out, to fit into the first six hours.  When I recently watched the first movie, The Continuing Story, for the first time, I thought in the beginning that it was Rilla's story because it takes place during World War I.  Rilla is Anne's youngest child and her book is the last Lucy Montgomery wrote in the Anne series. The time period and a baby boy that must be looked after are the only tie-ins to the original books.  In the books Anne is a middle aged mother and Rilla is a young woman when Canada becomes involved in the war.  However, in the movie, Anne and Gilbert are newlyweds helping the war effort in Europe.  The two become separated and Anne, a baby boy in tow, becomes involved in a game of espionage while searching for Gilbert.

Even though there is a little deviation from the original Anne stories you won't be disapointed in these movies, and if you've never read them you won't know the difference!

Megan Follows played the part of Anne Shirley to absolute perfection. I will watch the first two DVD's endlessly. I never grow tired of watching my favorite books come to life on screen. Of course this was not the case for the ""Continuing"" story. It was not continuing anything as far as Lucy Maud Montgomery was concerned. I found the third film to be terribly depressing and it annoyed me to death that the third film did not follow the books. I've seen it once and do not plan on watching it again. (Apparently Megan Follows had many misgivings about the same thing). I'm glad she played Anne once more, and her acting was superb as usual but the final film had none of the magic of the first two.

As for the quality of the DVD's. Not so good. Which is why I only gave four stars. On several occasions the voice track did not match the actors. This happened on both DVD's of the first two films. It was terribly distracting. It would right itself eventually, but it was annoying nonetheless. The Continuing story DVD had side two on side one. It took me a few minutes before I realized that what I was watching couldn't possibly be the opening for the film. I'm not sure what happened at the DVD factory but they screwed up several times. This is not a cheap set so to have several foul ups was frustrating.

All in all, I'm thrilled to have Anne in DVD format. I just wish the quality of the DVD's matched the quality of the acting.",1228608000,,1583,4.414383561643835

The Canadian locations are gorgeous, the costuming and script superb, and the actors will make you laugh and cry each time you watch it.  Thankfully the movies are based closely enough to the books, with more details omitted than added to true storyline - in fact the film will surpass any reader's expectations.
 It breaks my heart that the cast was 15 years too old for the 3rd film - but the ""continuing story"" keeps in step with the characters in their new dramas and adventures.

The video is very grainy like they made no attempt at all to remaster it.  At times the audio does not match the video.  Also, there is only a rudimentary menu system.

1709734,5,B000065OZ2,"Let me preface this review. I'm a typical guy. I like movies about fighter jets, fast cars and ninjas that blow things up with their minds.

I also love Anne of Green Gables.

I grew up with this series when I was kid with my sister. Reading about Anne and her adventures lifted our hearts, and we used to spend hours reading stacks of the books. There are almost too many funny, moving, touching and tragic moments to count, but the one thing this story captures so well is the power of the human spirit. Anne changes everyone around her for better with her imagination, positive nature, and strength of spirit. She's not without flaws though, her independent streak nearly costs her her happiness on a few occasions, but she always finds a way to come through in the end. Also great is the supporting cast. Who else wouldn't want Matthew and Marilla as neighbors? Or Dianne or Gilbert as a friends or a girlfriend/boyfriend?

Looking back now, it reminds me of a simpler, purer time far removed from the grim and griminess of the cold, impersonal, so called, 'civilized' life now a days. My fondness for this series, the books, the made for TV films, and even the superb anime by Isao Takahata and Yoshifumi Kondo (who did the heart wrenching Grave of the Fireflies) hasn't diminished as the years have gone by. If you've never seen any of these before, you're cheating yourself out of a great experience. Read the books, watch the films, track down those anime episodes and get ready to be surprised with joy.

Sure, as a guy I can appreciate the carnage of a monster truck rally... but I get just as spell bound as Anne does picturing the White Way of Delight.",1210723200,28,1664,4.555183946488294

However, it is a wonderful story and I very much enjoyed watching it again. :)",1190592000,106,490,4.304347826086956
1709863,5,B000065OZ2,"I watched these on VHS with my family years ago. Back then my daughter, about ten or so, same age as Anne when we first see her, was reading the novels; renting the videos was a natural thing. I was reluctant to watch the first story--my tastes tend more toward gritty crime and action stuff--but I watched them with my wife, daughter, and 8-yr. old son. It did not take me long to get caught up in the enthralling story. Canadian actress Megan Follows with her flaming red hair, which she is initially so ashamed of, is absolutely perfect as Anne Shirley. I would say she was born to play that role. All of the characters and portrayals are so wonderful that you will be thoroughly entertained. The late and indescribably great Richard Farnsworth is his typical screen self: stoic, quiet, restrained, shy, honest, fun-loving, humble, self-sacrificing, hard-working, strong, venerable. And gents: isn't that a list of very admirable traits? What man would not want to be remembered in such a way? So there you have one reason why you, as a man and father, should watch this series: if you pattern yourself after Mr. Farnsworth in this film, you will be on the right track. I absolutely defy anyone, even the most macho guy in the world, to not gush with tears upon viewing the scene where Farnworth's character buys, and then presents the beautiful party dress to Anne.

Another reason to watch this: you and your children will be seeing a solid and dignified life being put together before your eyes. Anne is an intelligent girl, but she understands the value of hard work. She loves to have fun, can be a bit contrary and capricious, but when the job needs to be done, she will do whatever it takes. She is an orphan who, through sheer determination and hard work, overcomes her meagre beginnings to really make a name for herself in the world. She is happy, and she takes life as it comes. Most importantly, she has a good heart and high moral standards. What parent would not want their child to be so described?

While it is very true that nowadays it is difficult to find good ""family"" viewing, if you look around, you will find it. Start here, dads; buy this set for your family and most importantly, spend some quality time with them watching the set. This is one of the best things you could do for them.

I guarantee it: you will laugh, you will cry, you will be afraid, you will exult. You will experience every emotion life has to offer. There are no cardboard cutout characters here; no one is perfect. That's another reason to watch: it's like life, and through meeting these living and breathing characters with all of their frailties and foibles, your kids will get a taste, albeit a vicarious one, of what the world is like. Perhaps they will begin to understand that life is not quite fair, that you have to work pretty hard, that people can be unkind even when you are kind to them, and most important, to be yourself. Anne the unkempt orphan comes into the life of the dour old spinster and her hard-working farmer brother, and gradually over time she becomes their savior. She saves them from a life of monotony, self-involvement and predictability; she teaches them how to be patient, how to laugh, how to prioritize. Isn't that what children do for their parents, if the parents will let them?

Anne is a girl who becomes a truly successful adult, if you measure success by how happy, intelligent, self-assured, confident, caring and fulfilled she is. If your kids can pick up some of those traits by watching the series, and you can help them, how can you go wrong?",1189987200,484,3589,4.603125
