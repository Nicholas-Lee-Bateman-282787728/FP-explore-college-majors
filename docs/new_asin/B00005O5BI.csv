7948289,4,B00005O5BI,"Where as the first disc of MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM focussed on the WhiteBases struggle to get to Earth, disc 2 opens us up to the mysterious character Char and his past, particularily a past that involves the family of his friend Garma Zabi, the son of Zeon's ruler Degwin Sodo Zabi.  Char in almost every episode here has his own little thoughts as he builds his plans of a revenge.  Garma is in charge of most of Earth's forces and must stop the Whitebase from escaping into safe territory with his fleet of fighter jets, tanks and his own flying fortress style carrier.
Meanwhile on Whitebase, the endless fighting is taking it's toll on Amuro who loses the want to go and fight and even reaches a boiling point with Bright the Whitebase commander.  Amuro wants the war to end and even witnesses refuges stealing food from the others in these desperate times.  Sad.
Even with the same number of episodes on the disc, it moves at a slightly slower pace particularily with two ""throwaway"" episodes one involving Amuro to try and get a message out to Fed HQ in his fighter (Kai by the way was never a bigger jerk) and in another has Whitebase attempting a seace fire to help evacuate their refugees (This one at least is entertaining, with one of the nicest Zeon pilots you'll meet).  The final two are both great and episode 10 culminates on how far Char will go for his own plans.  If not for the two middle episodes I mentioned and the slower pace, this might have gotten 5 stars.  Oh well, good disk anyhow and the best is still coming.",1045440000,,1535,4.460714285714285

Char decides to kick up his feet and let Garma do most of the work. While Garma finds out how powerful the Gundam is the hard way, Amuro starts to question his own reason for fighting. Char thinks Garma is nothing but a spoiled rich kid of the Zabi family. Garma plans to wipe this from his record, but Char plans to humliate Garma. Even going as a far as to cut off radio contact with Garma's fighter during battle. Soon, Char plays Garma right into his trap. And as not to seem like a backstabber, he makes it look like an accident.
I would have to say that even though these are only the first few episodes, they really are entertaining. All 5 episodes move at a fast pace and never slow down. One of which that could be most noted for is episode #8 in which a civilian survivor actually finds out just how kind Zeon soldiers can be during a seize-fire. I think that points out a very big psychological aspect and prooves that Gundam is more than just a show about good versus evil.
The extras on this disc are a bit slim, but worth noting. You get a bio on the regular Zaku and Char's Zaku. These are very informative if you really like Gundam. Bandai might not be cranking out extras, but they sure know a lot about Gundam. The menu is the same as the last disc with an exception for Char's presense. The disc runs fairly well, except for the last two episodes, which, from what the sounds made on my DVD player, sounded like it was switching on to a whole other part of the disc. So you might want to make sure you have a high quality DVD player to be on the safe side. Also, while playing this disc on my Oritron 2001, I noticed that the red colors tend to bleed, not a lot, but enough to be noticed. When I played it on my Sony DVD player, it was perfect. Just a little warning.
With the Gundam franchise going strong and showing no signs of slowing down, you might as well get caught up in it now. Finally, an anime bandwagon I can be proud to be on.
Side Note: In a recent interview with one of the guys from Bandai, he stated a little hint about Gundam subtitles in the future.",1007683200,,2316,4.160356347438753
7948291,5,B00005O5BI,"This DVD is one of my favorite parts of the Mobile Suit Gundam series thus far.  Covering episodes 6-10 of the series, this DVD entails the first battles of the White Base and its crew against the Zeon occupation forces on Earth.  What starts out as a relatively typical series of battles ends with a major plot twist that will leave viewers surprised and waiting for more.
Considering the age of the series, this DVD is of quite good quality.  Extra features are kind of scarse, but extra features mean very little if the series isn't good.  With all things taken into account, though, this DVD is a great selection for a Gundam fan and definitely worth a look.",1003017600,3,662,4.53781512605042
