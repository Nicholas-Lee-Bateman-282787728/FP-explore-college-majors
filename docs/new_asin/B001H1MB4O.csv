8307640,4,B001H1MB4O,The plot is pure cod but who cares? The circus animals and performances are great - it's lurid kitsch and has the best blackest opening title ever. A Saturday night treat!,1501286400,,171,4.548387096774194
8307641,4,B001H1MB4O,"The details of this DVD show a running time of 96 minutes, as do the cover and all book references. However, the actual running time is only approximately 91 minutes. At about 81 minutes into the running there is a distinct cut in the middle of a scene with dialogue to a completely different scene of an outdoors night shot of a thunder and lightning storm. So not only cut, but very badly so. It could be that part of the original source is now missing. If so, the details should stipulate what the problem is. I tried to send an email to Sony Pictures in Spain, who seem to have produced the DVD, to enquire about it but was unable to on my home computer. Even though I translated the appropriate page, some of it was still in Spanish which I couldn't understand. I could neither complete a message nor send it.",1271980800,,814,4.326797385620915
8307642,4,B001H1MB4O,"If you wanted to be good to yourself about now, then the purchase of a Multi-Region/Code-free DVD Player would be the perfect tool to provide those movies that other Regions are carrying that Region 1 just won't answer the call.  There are many movies that just haven't turned up on DVD yet in Region 1.  Where is the release of Joan Crawford in ""Berserk!?""  Well Sony/Columbia have released Jim O'Connolly's 1968 circus shocker from their plant in Spain on Region 2 (rather notorious for inept transfers (The pressing of ""X, Y & Zee"" supposedly has duplicated scenes)).  If you are just tired of waiting for American studios to stop being so dumb, then treat yourself to a wider range of viewing pleasures for your collection that European audiences seem to have available to them.

SONY/Columbia did a reasonable job with ""Berserk!""  How could they keep from us so long Joan up to her pretty neck in her own gams (showing off her youthful legs so brazenly has been a comment every reviewer of this film makes), hunky Ty Hardin (yes, Joan's can still attract a certain appeal); winsome Judy Geeson fresh from addicitve-making feminine mannerisms we all loved in ""To Sir, With Love"" as Crawford's daughter; and her circus is beset by a sadistic killer who, with Joan's business saavy to keep the circus running at any cost, especially this one, outdoes her own box office.  Presented in grand Hollywood style, this shocker made in England takes a stab at notoriety among circus shockers and keeps up with them in the now ""camp"" we've come to love.  Once again, our sense of history is being withheld.

Why the film isn't on Region 1 and why European product has that element of poorer quality does not make sense, but at the prices today of technological advances, it pays to make yourself happy with your viewing pleasure before you run out of breath.  I mean, we can find ""Trog"" so why not ""Berserk!""?  If you love your movies, then go for it.",1252886400,2,1945,4.6911764705882355
