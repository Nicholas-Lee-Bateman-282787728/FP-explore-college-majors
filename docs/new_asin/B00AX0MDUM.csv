8558671,5,B00AX0MDUM,"I was having fun teasing Cousin Nancy, (i.e. The one that used to be a Red-head and giggled...) about her broken DVD Player. That brought up the movie that I had to buy from France because, I don't know why it wasn't available here, it just wasn't available here.

It was all about one of the last comments Kari Whurer made on KariWhurer.net. She commented that her kids were telling people that she was working on ""Alien Tomato"" and she thought that was cute... I do miss those times when it was safe for a Public Personality to have a Web Page. Kari's was fun, I thought so, at least.

Kari Whurer in a fun movie. It's for fun, and two hours of fantasy that's almost as good as an old ""Maverick"" show with James Garner.

The plot is straight out of the '50s or '60s, and the Cowboy ends up fighting way above his class and the woman is just like you want her to be. Saucy and Intelligent. One of those women that can beat you at Bridge, or Pinochle. Not your everyday lady.

And the Cowboy has a daughter and he spent her College Savings on keeping the ranch, so you are immediately on her side, even though the ranch is close to Chicago, not out West.

But everything happens the way you know it will, and that's as it should be.

Do remember, it's a B Movie so don't expect the end of the world. But Chicago gets destroyed, and that's probably a good thing...

8558672,5,B00AX0MDUM,"Was so happy to find that one of my favorite SyFy movies ""Alien Tornado"" had not disappeared but merely had a new name.  A great movie for those who love the disaster genre. The description given on Amazon did not quite match the movie, but it was the same movie I watched over and over again on SyFy.",1431648000,,301,4.189655172413793

Judd Walker is a widowed misogynistic farmer pestered my alien tornadoes. We never get to see the aliens because they are made of energy and are causing tornadoes because...???.. maybe we beamed ""Gilligan's Island"" into space? Judd meets up with a cleavage storm chaser (Kari Wuhrer) to prove to the world even the most disgusting man can land a babe if they save the world together. Her name is.....wait for it....Gale.

Judd has a daughter Kelly (Stacey Asaro) who is under the impression that the only way she can get accepted into the University of Malaysia is to study hard and save the world from green funnel tornadoes.

Of course aliens attacking Chicago is not enough action for any film shown on SyFy, there must also be MIBs who hamper us from saving us.

This is standard low quality SyFy fare, Asylum grade entertainment.

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity on TV version. Kids should like it.",1425686400,,926,4.7625
