4395895,1,B004K8X0ZA,"Usually Kiosk Rating <1 is reserved for those rentals were production companies are making one last ditch attempt to grab some rental money from a movie that nobody was ever interested in for any number of reasons. Because of it's Indie origins (meaning no money) in some people's minds it is above criticism. My criticism is that it was neither memorable nor creative. It was just holding a camera exercise.
Plot:
So five minutes into the movie there is nothing but a face directed at the hand held camera (the rage these past couple of years) telling us that they are documenting the fact they and others are filming a series of murder scenes. Every so often you see the same face in a mock court room still talking. The murders, in case you're wondering, are just some people lying on the ground, bed, whatever with some paint on them, pretending to be dead (except you can see them breathing). Bored with the repetitive talking faces, sophomoric dialogue and cheap effects I was forced to skip forward 5 minutes - same scenario; then another 5 minutes - same thing; then ... all the way to the end. If there was any spoof, statement, comedic humor embedded within the 90 minutes then I regret missing 10th grade because it went past me.",1320192000,4,1240,4.615384615384615
4395896,5,B004K8X0ZA,"This movie is a great example of how good Indie films can be when people who know what they are doing make them: funny, entertaining, irreverent and topical. Support these talented people so they make more awesome films!!",1306281600,8,221,4.842105263157895
4395897,5,B004K8X0ZA,"Considering that it seemed like there were actually two movies going on here, I can heartily recommend this film, since I never once felt bored or that the picture really slowed down a lot. Will it win an Academy Award? Probably not. Is it worth your time. Definitely!",1305936000,4,268,4.604166666666667
4395898,5,B004K8X0ZA,"I saw this at the Austin Film Festival.  The theater was sold out, but we did get in.  The audience loved it.  The audience was mostly a 30's something crowd.  Very clever movie.  I believe that they have gotten Best Comedy at the Hollywood Film Festival, Most Interesting Film at Slam Dance Film Festival, Best Director at Edmunton Film Festival, and an award at the Phoenix Film Festival.  I highly recommend this film.",1302825600,3,421,4.698630136986301
4395899,5,B004K8X0ZA,"I caught/projected this awesome film several times at the 2010 Slamdance Film Fest, and it is definitely one of my favorite films of all time. Can't wait to get my copy, then go camp out in line with some hottie to get it signed by the cast and crew, who will probably be all LA by that point and pretend they don't know me until I bring the goods to the afterparty. It's just that awesome of a flick, so get a copy now before they're available. You can brag about it like I do.",1301875200,3,478,4.042105263157895
4395900,5,B004K8X0ZA,Absolutely love this movie. Runaway hit at the Phx Film Festival.,1443830400,,65,5.0
4395901,5,B004K8X0ZA,For an Indie production this is one of the best overall I have seen.  One actor reminds me of Dwight Yoakum and he has the flair for acting.  Well done to everybody.  Amazing and I would pay to see this in a theatre; like an Art Theatre that gives space and time to Indie films.  I'll be watching for others with this teaM!,1443571200,,323,4.079365079365079
4395902,1,B004K8X0ZA,A really bad movie.  Poor acting and script.  No redeeming charachteristics.,1442620800,,76,5.818181818181818
4395903,4,B004K8X0ZA,"I'll be honest, i didn't expect to like this, but i really did.  It does what a lot of Indie movies fail to do, make do with what the have. The acting was decent, the story was pretty great, the only reason i don't find it a five star is because of the slightly predictable ending and the amount of attention given to the director (which is fine, it just off-balanced itself a bit) and another thing but i don't want to spoil anything.

It's a pretty great story of a director who needs to get a job that pays more, so he does crime scene filming. His buddy who works with him as his ""producer"" wants him to try and make a name for himself in crime scene footage. During the movie it flashes to a courtroom where they are clearly on trial for something we aren't quite sure of for the first bit of the movie. They meet a crime scene cleaner who seems to notice more than the cops investigating the crime. It's far more humorous and interesting than i'm describing.
 Since it is free on prime right now, it's worth a watch, i wouldn't pay the rental fee, unless you watch the trailer and think it's up your alley. I again have to say this is a wonderful example of what can be achieved when you enjoy what you do, because it really shows, everyone acted well, the shots were set up well, the writing, the directing.",1438560000,3,1314,4.227091633466135
4395904,5,B004K8X0ZA,"Excellent film, I loved this film from start to finish.
Highly recommended if you like good films, reminded me of behind the mask of Leslie Vernon.
Lots of references to film makers which I enjoyed and although not a comedy(perhaps dark humour) it is witty and had me laughing at the clever way in which the scenes where cut.
I scanned imdb  in hopes to find more films by Todd Berger but found myself disappointed, he has however done a bunch of shorts which I will now binge watch. I look forward to his next film. This guy will be a big name.",1431993600,2,545,4.29126213592233
4395905,4,B004K8X0ZA,Pretty good off-beat comedy.,1429488000,,28,6.25
4395906,5,B004K8X0ZA,"An excellent movie which reminded me in many ways without the production dollars of the movie, Barcelona. It is likely that most costly scene location was at a press conference at the Pasadena City Hall.
  The first rate script makes the movie. There is off-beat dialogue and an odd story. What saves the script and the movie are the characters, true to the roles they're playing. So a comic scene occurs when ""film producer"" and ""writer director,"" both fresh from film school, fight. Of course, no one is hurt.
  The producer and director/writer are making a documentary of police investigations of murders in Los Angeles. At the second murder scene they stay after the police leave. (Police procedures are lax.) They talk to the crime scene clean-up guy who has discovered clues: First victim was killed with a switchblade, and a CD of a local band, Switch, is in the room. Second victim is killed with a bug bomb, and a CD of the local band, Toxic Air, is in the room. There are other clues which will make the producer and director famous.
  Director/writer and producer bring clean-up guy into the production, and pursuit of the serial killer is on. The film makers are helped by the serial killer sending DVRs of premurder activities to the film makers. There is ample use of cliches: A victim dressed as a witch at a Halloween Party brings on the line of dialogue: ""The witch is dead."" Clean-up guy tries to renew his romance with blonde bombshell TV journalist who is covering the murders. He confides in her; she deceives him which makes the romance rocky. A black guy claims to be the serial killer and wants to cooperate with the production. Clean up guy unmasks him (right not left handed; 90 percent of all serial killers are white males). Black guy is an actor who wanted the work whether it pays or not.
The movie ends before cliches become too burdensome, unfresh and uninventive.
Other than its intrinsic value the other reason to watch The Scenesters is to observe that entertaining movies can be made for little money by competent people who are mostly unknown. If entertainment was not so enamored with animation and special effects, movie makers could learn much from The Scenestes.",1406764800,2,2203,4.738903394255875
4395907,5,B004K8X0ZA,"This film is a lot of things, but one thing it's not is boring. Equal parts noir-style mystery, psychological thriller, stalker/slasher film, found footage film, courtroom drama, meta-cinema, and faux documentary, all over a denominator of black comedy, The Scenesters holds together incredibly well. It's often hilarious, with a deadpan sensibility that's admirable coming from a group with an improv comedy background. The script manages to pull off a lot of nice surprises and misleads. The film does a great job of using the tools of its different genres in the service of making a comic commentary on them. Definitely a welcome surprise. If you like this, check out the group's latest film, It's a Disaster, coming soon to theaters and VOD. They're both a step above the mainstream comedies we're seeing today.",1362441600,,815,5.135338345864661
4395908,5,B004K8X0ZA,Fresh and funny throughout. A very creative use of different film techniques all in the same movie. I was totally surprised by the ending.,1356220800,2,138,4.791666666666667
4395909,5,B004K8X0ZA,"Funny clever hipster flick. It's basically a satire of the people who would want to watch it. I had seen it before, but I got it from here as a birthday gift for my brother, who is even more of a hipster snob than I am.",1322438400,,219,3.782608695652174

8432564,5,B004K8X0ZA,I thought The Scenesters was hilarious. An amateur documentarian chooses a crime scene cleaner with an eye for detail as the subject of his film. The cleaner surmises a series of murders to be the work of a serial killer and starts investigating with camera crew in tow. The cast is great and I also learned some interesting tidbits about the history of Los Angeles.,1468540800,2,366,4.6461538461538465
8432565,3,B004K8X0ZA,It was entertaining and pretentious.  Exactly what you would expect from an indie film called The Scenesters.,1464134400,,109,5.411764705882353
