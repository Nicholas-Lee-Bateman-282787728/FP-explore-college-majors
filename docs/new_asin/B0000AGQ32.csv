7996919,2,B0000AGQ32,"Sunnyboy & Sugarbaby (She's 19 & Ready in the U.S.) is what it is, a late 1970's Euro sex romp. Back in 1981, when Cinemax played this movie quite a bit, I probably would've given this movie 4 stars. It just doesn't hold up to the years. Also, as others mentioned this DVD was manufactured from a VHS transfer, and there are tracking lines throughout the entire movie.",1423267200,,368,4.426470588235294
7996920,2,B0000AGQ32,"Not really something special. Transfer is from VHS tape, colors off etc. The main attraction--Janssen plays secondary role.
Plot is kinda artificial but gives some exotic locations. Yeah, waste your money like me. Avoid.",1385424000,,220,5.5
