8072650,3,B000A2W3NA,I was glad to receive the order only problem was it wasn't a two pack. Price was still good kids love the DVD but the other one never showed,1483574400,,140,3.8620689655172415
8072651,5,B000A2W3NA,"We don't have Toot, Toot, but we have Wiggle Bay and after reading the other review I just had to add mine! We love Wiggle Bay in our house. All four of us - my husband and I included with our seven year old and [...] year old. The music is catchy (Barbie on the Beach) and soothing (Wiggle Bay). It's just as cheesey as all of the other Wiggle videos, but it's also just as entertaining and nobody has a better sound than the Wiggles!",1244332800,,435,4.069767441860465

toot toot chuga chuga chuga big red car, it travels near and it travels far. That's wonderful.

This was an unfortunate choice of packaging. I don't know if toot toot by itself is worth the price. I would say that wiggly bay is probably the weakest of  all our beloved wiggley movies",1167091200,,309,4.385964912280702
