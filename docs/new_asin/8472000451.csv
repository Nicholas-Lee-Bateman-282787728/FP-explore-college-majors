God Bless Don Moen he really led the Holy Spirit fell in the presence of this recording.
I read a review about picture and sound not good of this VHS. I can say the following.
I re-recorded this VHS on a dvd and enhanced the sound and picture.
The quality prior my sound and picture enhancement was already perfect, now imagine what I'm enjoying afterwards.
Don Moen, God bless you and blessed be anyone who buy this tape and praise the Lord. God is good all the TIME",1415232000,,487,4.304347826086956
