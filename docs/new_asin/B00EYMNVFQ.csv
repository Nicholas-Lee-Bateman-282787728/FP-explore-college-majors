5956233,5,B00EYMNVFQ,I bought this for my husband he loves it! He will be watching this forever thanks for putting it out for Christmas!,1388275200,,115,4.2727272727272725
5956234,5,B00EYMNVFQ,"Obviously I am a huge Red Sox fan.  This is a must have for all Red Sox Nation.  No one expected this team to even contend, let alone make the playoffs and go all the way.  The six games of the World Series are complete.  I like the option of choosing either the announcers of either team or, if you want to be tortured - listen to Tim McCarver.  The best news from this series, besides Boston winning, was finding out that this old windbag was calling it a career.  He was a far better player than an announcer.  My only complaint is this series does not include all six games of the ALCS with the Detroit Tigers.  I was unable to watch either series on TV, but was able to listen to most of the games on radio.  The ALCS was perhaps more exciting than the World Series.  The Tigers pitching was so outstanding!  Timely hitting and great pitching on the Boston side was the only reason the Sox won.  This set does include the ALCS game six, but this could have been a real collector's item had the entire ALCS been included.  That was baseball at its best!",1388188800,2,1057,4.225
5956235,3,B00EYMNVFQ,"Kind of disappointing: I have the World Series DVD collections for the 2003 and 2007 Red Sox and both have multiple ALCS games, and each DVD comes in its own case, that has stats and other information about each game on the cover.  This one is 8 discs, but they are in one case, have no stats on them, and only one is of the ALCS (game 6 only).  It does include a ""sleevestats"" little booklet inside, but it isn't the same as the other DVD's.  This is a nice product, but not as nice as the other ones I have, that MLB has produced in the past.",1386633600,3,544,4.018518518518518
5956236,4,B00EYMNVFQ,"Last week, I received my Blu-Ray version copy of the 2013 World Series Collector's Edition (CE) on Blu-ray, which was released on December 3, 2013 by Lionsgate Films and A&E Networks. (I also own DVD versions of the World Series CEs of the 2004 and 2007 Fall Classics.) To say the least, I am very pleased with my most recent purchase.

The Blu-Ray version of the 2013 World Series CE is, in a word, excellent! All six of the games between the eventual World Series champion Boston Red Sox and the National League champion St. Louis Cardinals are shown in full 720p high definition video and 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio  splendor. To my untrained eyes and ears, the video and audio quality of each disc actually exceeds what I experienced when I watched the games' live broadcasts.

One very noticeable improvement in the 2013 World Series CE over its 2004 and 2007 predecessors (besides the obvious vast improvements in video and audio quality) is that the editors appear to have been much more careful in how they cut extraneous material from the live broadcasts in order to fit the games on the discs. In the 2004 and 2007 DVD CEs,  cuts and splices were made much more haphazardly, in a manner that gave each game a chopped-up feel with little natural flow. The 2013 CE permits viewers to experience each game with almost none of the ""choppiness"" that was so apparent in previous CEs.

The 2013 World Series CE isn't quite perfect, however. The discs' interactive menu, although visually very appealing, is a bit difficult to get going at first. When I first tried to watch a game, I couldn't get the menu to work; I thought I had a set of defective discs, each of which would only show three advertisements and a montage of World Series film clips, before a ""dead"" menu popped up. Almost by accident,  I discovered the trick to making the interactive  menu work: you have to play completely through the video montage, and not bypass it with the ""Skip"" button on your Blu-Ray player remote. Then the menu will work fine.

My other gripe is the number of League Championship Series (LCS) games included in the 2013 World Series CE. For some reason, editors only chose one LCS playoff game for inclusion in the set: Game 6 of the ALCS, which includes Shane Victorino's now-famous game-winning grand slam home run. This begs the question: why not also include, at the very minimum, ALCS Game 2, with David Ortiz's even more famous game-tying grand slam homer? Or, better yet, why not include all six ALCS games? I certainly would have paid for such a set, as would many other people as well.

Despite these minor complaints, the 2013 World Series Collector's Edition is very well produced, and an essential addition to my Blu-Ray collection. Highly recommended.",1386460800,8,2758,4.717255717255718
5956237,3,B00EYMNVFQ,"Despite the fact that these games took place just barely over a month ago, I was anxiously awaiting this set.  As a Red Sox fan suffering from the disaster of the 2012 season, it was nice to see the team go all the way this year.  While this collector's edition is a good way to relive the experience, it falls short in a couple of areas.

I'll keep this part brief.  The picture is gorgeous, the multiple audio options mean you don't have listen to Buck and McCarver, and the bonus disc highlighting the walk-off wins is pretty nifty.  When it comes to the World Series itself, this set has what you want--assuming you're a Red Sox fan.  I guess they figured not many St. Louis fans would be very eager to buy this set, anyway.  But it would have been nice to have a little more balance.  After all, St. Louis had a great season, too.

Even though little compares to the 2004 ALCS, it sure was nice that for that year they included all of the games in the boxed set.  This year, we only get Game 6.  Which... well at that point, why did they even bother?  Just one game?  It wasn't 2004, but it was still a great series.  Tough luck, Detroit fans.  At least we get to see Shane's slam.

Finally, there is definitely an issue with how these discs were authored.  My brand new Panasonic BDT230 will NOT play these discs (*see update, below).  You get to the main menu and you can't do anything.  No buttons work at all, not on the remote or on the unit itself.  When I tried them on my computer's Blu-ray drive they worked, but they weren't in the proper aspect ratio and the menu selection text didn't overlay the menu items correctly.  My older Samsung player could play the discs, but one of the ads at the beginning which could be skipped on the previous two devices couldn't be skipped here, so I had to watch it every. single. time.  And it's long.  Definitely not the finest production in the world.  Presumably future firmware updates to the players will fix this, but you might want to hold off if you have a 2013 Panasonic player because you literally can only watch the ads at the beginning and look at the menu screen.

So in the end I can only give this release three stars.  Red Sox fans are sure to enjoy it despite the problems.  But technologically and as a general record of the 2013 post season, it's lacking.

** UPDATE 12/8/13: **

Thanks to Mike Powers in the comments, I now know that you can make the menus work on the Panasonic Blu-Ray player if you do NOT skip the montage after the Boys & Girls Club ad but instead watch the whole thing.  It will not change my review score because that is some obviously flawed authoring.  But it's nice to know that you CAN in fact watch these with a minor inconvenience.",1386201600,8,2732,4.318897637795276
5956238,5,B00EYMNVFQ,"This 8 disc collection on blu ray is very different looking than in World Series Editions in years past.  This year, you will not receive 8 individual Blu ray covers; You will receive an outer attractive cardboard title cover that you would have to slide off to get to the actual blu ray plastic case.  You will open the case like opening up a book and you will see a 14 page insert with all 7 complete games' stats and info as in years past sans each inning play by play account. Attached to the center of this large case, you will see 4 plastic disc inserts that holds all 8 discs. Discs 1-6 are games 1-6 of the 2013 World Series; Disc 7 is Game 6 of the ALCS, Tigers vs Red Sox.  Disc 8 is the Bonus Disc.  Now, if you weren't completely satisfied with the ""2013 World Series Film"" (sold separately), then this Bonus Disc will take the cake!

5956259,5,B00EYMNVFQ,A must for any Red Sox fan. It never gets old seeing your team win. The production quality is first rate and you will appreciate the commentary as this worst to first team becomes a part of the team's rich lore.,1394841600,,211,4.170731707317073

5956262,5,B00EYMNVFQ,"Having been hospitalized for a portion of the 2013 World Series,I didn't get to see every game. I'm so happy with this DVD collection! The best feature is being able to choose from the network broadcast or the radio broadcast from either city. Thank you MLB! I was't sure if I would be around much longer or not,but here I am,and now I've had the chance to see and hear the 2013 World Series in it's entirety! Let's do it again,Boston!

5956264,5,B00EYMNVFQ,"As a life long Red Sox fan, I love watching the 2013 World Series Collector's Edition in Blu-ray format....especially the games the Sox won.  The set captures all the excitement and drama without the commercials that interrupted the action during the series.

The final game of the Detroit-Sox series is included, but I wish that all the games in the AL Championship Series were part of the set,
Of the many formats available, this is probably the most complete and best set to buy.",1393113600,,482,4.726190476190476
5956265,2,B00EYMNVFQ,"I chose two stars because of these reasons. 1. they left out all of the Nathaniel anthem and the announcing of the players. 2. they only had one game in the ALCS. 3. The bonus disk didn't have much on it, while the 2007 series had all of that plus much more. on the good side the games were great and the quality was amazing plus the Sox are great in anything but thats not enough to balance the bad things so in the end they did a bad job on the games. They could have done way better.",1393113600,2,486,3.919191919191919
5956266,5,B00EYMNVFQ,"What more could a Red Sox fan want?  Well, perhaps a repeat of season past!  But for a remembrance of a great 2013 season, you  won't be able to resist this 8-disc collector's edition.  Not only does it cover in its entirety the exciting World Series clash with the Cardinals but also the clinching game 6 of the ALCS and key highlights of other games in the ALCS and the ALDS. There's also a bonus disc with coverage of the amazing walk-off wins by the Red Sox plus individual milestones, postseason highlights, etc.  What I really liked with the World Series discs is the availability of four different audio options so after watching it with the Fox commentators, you can then enjoy a totally different perspective from the very emotional Red Sox radio team. There's also a Cardinals and a Spanish commentary available.  But no point me rattling on:  the games are there for the watching, so Red Sox  fans (and others) head for the bleachers and root, root, root for the home team!",1393027200,2,984,4.614942528735632
5956267,5,B00EYMNVFQ,"I realize that the ending to this story has already been told, but it is the telling that is the fun. As a child I endured the disappointments of the Boston Red Sox. Now I am nearly 60 and I can revel in their success. Please don't hate me for enjoying this. Remember, the Soxs were also this good in the early 20th century and it took 86 years to get back that glory. Lets hope this streak keeps going and going.....
this is totally worth buying",1392768000,,446,4.137931034482759

I am a die hard fan and truly appreciate having a comprehensive set like this.  Can't wait to begin reliving last season before the season opener this year!

5956271,2,B00EYMNVFQ,"I never got to see game three or game six, where the sox actually won the series, as with each game, I paused the disc to get something to drink and when I started the disc up again, both discs were suddenly unwatchable. They were stuttered at first, lost audio and then the picture froze. I tried several times to get these discs to work with no better results. I feel as though I completely wasted my money on this blue ray set. I give it two stars because I, at least, got to watch games 1, 2, 4 and 5. I have been to discouraged to watch the bonus disc or the ALCS game. I wish I could do this over because I never would have bought these.

The three previous editions I own have much more appealing packaging: Each DVD is in its own slim case, and the eight slim cases are housed in a nice slip case.  The 2013 edition uses a single case with somewhat flimsy swinging trays that hold DVDs on both sides.

I also don't understand why MLB Productions is being so stingy with the highlights DVD.  No highlights are included from the games that are presented in full in this package.

8610333,5,B00EYMNVFQ,"Such an amazing World Series and Ortiz showed why he is always to be feared when the stakes are the highest. This team was one of my favorite Sox teams as they were lovable like the '04 idiots and all seemed to make major contributions at the right time. This was special because of the marathon bombing earlier in the year, it was the birth year of my daughter, they clinched at Fenway, and oh yeah it was my birthday when they won game 6 too. Can't wait for this season. Go Sox!",1457049600,,480,4.172043010752688
8610334,4,B00EYMNVFQ,"Great edition for any Sox fan, especially if you have the '04 and '07 Editions. I would have liked to see more of the segments that are played before or after commercials but otherwise excellent quality picture, fills out the whole screen, I'm not a letterbox fan so that was great.",1456012800,,282,4.549019607843137
