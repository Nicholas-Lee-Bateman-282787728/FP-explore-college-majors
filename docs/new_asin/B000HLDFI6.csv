8541309,3,B000HLDFI6,"I have been a fan of Shirley Temple ever since I was seven years old. Now, I am 24 years old and I have many of her movies on VHS, but my DVD collection is now growing. Have these movies on DVD are great, especially since the Baby Burlesks films she did for Educational Pictures from 1932 are now restored to their completeness and the first volume is great. But I was disapointed with the second volume of her films. While I have seen all of the ""Frolics of Youth"" on VHS, it would have been nice to have seen these films restored to their complete glory as well. However, all we get is a newly colorized and cleaned up version of ""Merrily Yours"", while ""Pardon my Pups"" and ""Managed Money"" are heavily edited in a complilation titled ""Our Girl Shirley"" which was released as a short subject in 1942. Lastly, there is another complilation of her 20th Century Fox newsreels, which I have seen on another DVD.

For a little girl who made millions of people during the depression, I have yet to have seen a fitting DVD tribute for this talented woman. If the Our Gang films (which I enjoy as well) can be restored, why can't the films of Shirley Temple be restored?",1165968000,10,1163,4.3842592592592595
