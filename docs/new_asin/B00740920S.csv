8509558,3,B00740920S,"I first saw this series on a fan site where the English subtitles were done by the fans. I fell in love with the series but this review is NOT about the TV series but about this DVD of them, specifically for buyers who would use the English subtitles.

First a lot more needed to be subtitled -- there are a lot of words that appear on the screen some are mimicking manga usage of words to emphasize event, some is on every signage that our characters encounter, and some if on the evidence that they encounter. This all needs to be subtitled.

Second, the quality of the subtitling varied a great deal from episode to episode. A few times the subtitles were clearly misplaced because logically they simply did not make sense. Far more problematic was the second of the final two-part mystery that was clearly subtitled by a different group of people -- the text was different, the quality was horrific to the point of my family watching with me was completely confused.

If any form of media wishes to expand their audience they MUST invest in quality subtitles or voice overs. Frankly I want to hear the actors voices but come on! Do a better job of subtitles, folks!",1454025600,,1169,4.504716981132075

8509561,5,B00740920S,"This is one of my all-time favorite TV shows and one of the best dorama I have ever watched. The premise is a bit silly, but they play it up so well that you can't help but fall in love with the characters and be rooting for them every time. I also enjoy that while it's not obvious, all of the clues to the mystery are there before it is solved so that if you are really sharp you might even be able to solve it before the reveal! That said, they are well-explained so if you're a fan of puzzles this is fun.

I don't say this about most fiction, but I would recommend this dorama to ANYONE. It's awesome.

Also, these DVDs are some of the better-quality ones out of dorama that I have bought before. The subtitles are more clear and accurate than usual. The only exception is that sometimes during the end-credits song they are still talking and the lines sometimes get mixes up with the lyrics! But it is still comprehensible even the couple of times that happens.

Basically, I give some things 5 stars because they are very excellent quality, but this I would give TEN if it were possible! Very pleased to have this series. Thanks to those who make it available outside of Japan.",1408233600,,1184,4.324324324324325
8509562,4,B00740920S,"An amusing, fun TV series with likable and funny main characters. This would have received a 5-star rating, except the English subtitles are really bad. My family and I watched this on Japanese TV, which had very good English subtitles. If only the DVD had better English subtitles!",1389916800,,282,4.895833333333333
