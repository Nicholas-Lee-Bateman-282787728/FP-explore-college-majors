8060990,3,B0009HMTUS,"BLUE UNDERGROUND's EXTREME HORROR TWO-FER could technically be called a ""Triple-Play,"" as TWO EVIL EYES (1990) consists of a pair of unrelated stories by  different directors. This bifurcated film is dedicated to the memory of Edgar Allan Poe.

The first half, George Romero's ""The Facts in the Case of Mr. Valdemar,"" is flat-out DUMB-- there's no other way to describe it. Here, Adrienne Barbeau and her boyfriend try to keep Adrienne's elderly husband alive long enough to clean out the poor sap's bank accounts. Miss B.'s accomplice, Dr. Robert Hoffmann (Ramy Zada) hypnotizes the old boy and gets him to authorize bond transfers to the scheming wife.

Their victim croaks while under hypnosis so they move his corpse to a basement chest freezer that's packed with food. He quickly develops a nice layer of frost, plus a peculiar habit of talking without moving his lips. It seems Mr. Valdemar (Bingo O'Malley) can't go to his eternal rest until the doctor dehypnotizes him, and it better happen toot sweet, cuz THE SPIRITS are trying to occupy Valdemar's popsicled body! (boogie boogie!)

The second segment, Dario Argento's ""The Black Cat"" is somewhat better-- at least it's more believeable.
Crime scene fotog Roderick Usher (Harvey Keitel) has his home life with longtime girlfriend Annabel (Madeleine Potter) disrupted when she finds a stray cat, so Usher psychotically strangles the hissing animal and takes portrait photos of the act. Suspecting foul play, Annabel threatens to leave Rod. He murders her, too and entombs the two fresh corpses in the wall of an upstairs hallway.

Nosy next-door-neighbor Mrs. Pym is portrayed by Kim Hunter. It's hard to believe this elderly gal was once 'Stella' to Marlon Brando's 'Stanley' in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-STREETCAR-NAMED-DESIRE/dp/B000EBD9TY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE</a>&nbsp;(1954). Also as Pym's husband is Martin Balsam, who is (sadly) well into his dodderage. John Amos (Gordie the weatherman on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-MARY-TYLER-MOORE-SHOW/dp/B00005JLIC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW</a>) plays Rod's detective friend, Legrand.

DEAD AND BURIED (1981) is your typical walking dead sort of affair. Here, tourists visiting (or passing through) a coastal Rhode Island village are murdered by mobs of townspeople, but their corpses reanimate. Sheriff Gillis (James Farentino) isn't happy with the homicides, especially as wife Janet (Melody Anderson) is one of the killers. The only person who seems pleased with this wave of violence is town undertaker William G. Dobbs (Jack Albertson).

Stan Winston's gross-out special effects are quite good.
Watch for Robert Englund (aka 'Freddie Krueger') in a supporting role. Note that hitchhiker Lisa Marie is NOT the waspy-waisted gal who played 'Vampira' in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ED-WOOD/dp/B0000VD04M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ED WOOD</a>&nbsp;(1994).",1248652800,,3069,6.123255813953488
8060991,4,B0009HMTUS,"I originally bought this because I was looking for ""Two Evil Eyes"" but figured I'd buy it this way since it's like getting ""Dead & Buried"" for free.  As a Dario Argento fan I really was looking forward to Blue Underground's release of ""Two Evil Eyes"".  I wasn't disappointed.  Blue Underground has succeeded in putting out another great DVD set.  I had never seen ""Dead & Buried"" before but i quite enjoyed it.  It was deiniftely a nice bonus at no cost.  I ended up enjoying ""Dead & Buried"" more than I did the release if ""Two Evil Eyes"".  This set is definitely the way to go if you are looking for either one of these films.",1168992000,,627,4.3076923076923075
