5317444,5,B009D4RPIE,"Loved the show on tv. And still do. We are watching and rewatching the shows all the time and will do in the future.

P.S.: Ment to give the toy boat 5 stars as well!!!!!!",1353974400,4,171,3.8857142857142857
5317445,5,B009D4RPIE,"As Barnaby said, ""Hang on to the poetry."" Same beautiful Midsomer village/country vistas. Same multi-thread plots with multi-murders (3-4 in each ep). Character richness with extensive use of top British stars. Mixes mystery & humor behind the same haunting orchestra. Still one of TVs best crime shows, with even more episodes to be released. Still a UK hit, and with most USA fans.

DCI J.Barnaby uses a good bit more humor, cryptic in detective style. I like that! He's not shy about rule breaking--old family trait. Returning regulars with higher prominence are DS Jones (Jason Hughes) and Dr Bullard (Barry Jackson); as well as returning veteran writers & directors. Quality remains.

SUBTITLES for each of four 93 min mysteries, widescreen, Blu-ray Aspect Ratio: 1080p/16:9, and expect disturbing images, it is multiple murder as normal for Midsomer.
1 --DEATH IN THE SLOW LANE
82rd episode, first with Neil Dudgeon as head Barnaby sleuth. Locals know and love DS Jones. A 1960's race driver's death gets a fresh look while Jones & Barnaby work out a more amiable form of sleuthing. Friction persists.
Downton Abbey's Samantha Bond as Kate, with her ex (Tim Dutton) also conflict. Kate's dad (David Warner) is involved as a car judge and a twist. The show offers a delightful look at vintage cars. Is red hair a red herring? David Aitkens (Waiting for God) writes the first 2 episodes, not new to MM, exactly like all the writers and directors. Caroline Graham's writing characters continue; only a few retirees.

2 --DARK SECRETS
Scottish lass and beauty Fiona Dolman joins the permanent cast for many episodes to come as Sarah, Mrs. JB. On the crime plot, secrets & scandals block paths to a killer. A Social Servant visits dolally recluses William (Edward Fox) & Mary Bingham (Phyllida Law- Emma Thompson's ma), then is killed. Bingham daughter Selina (Beth Goddard) & hubby, Eddie Stanton (Neil Pearson) helps Barnaby visit the old couple prior to her murder. Watch for Ben (Julian Ovenden -Andrew Foyle & ""Forsyte Saga"") and Dr. Frost (John Quentin). These episodes are packed with stars, too many to mention them all. Jones to the dirty rescue again?

3 --ECHOES OF THE DEAD with female nudity
Copycat killer and the body count rises. Victim's flat mate Jo (Sarah Smart) works at a donkey sanctuary owned by Liz (Pam Ferris -Rosemary & Thyme) with a landlord Bernard (Ron Cook -Little Dorrit) who's a peeping Tom. Deaths mount with the connecting theme of marriage. Plenty of suspects and bodies and Jones rescues victim 5.

4 THE OBLONG MURDERS with DS Jones nudity
Dr. Bullard's friend's daughter is missing from Oblong Foundation (new age- Obbies). The director is Freddie (Josephine Butler and new members include Blaze (Christine Bottomley -Hope Springs). In the local pub you'll meet Paddy (Kevin Doyle), Claire (Holly Aird) and Commodore (John Woodvine). Jones must go undercover & finds past deaths as suspicious. Meanwhile, the Barnaby's find a dog minder in Millie (Barbara Flynn -Cranford, and so much more). Again, huge star list.
Quote by Dr. Ballard (his 76th episode) to DCI Barnaby, after announcing his Irish fishing holiday: ""Tom was a hard act to follow. You're getting there.""

Bottom line: Near perfection in acting, writing, drama, dialogue, guest stars, and new roles freshen the series that's continuing a trend setter started in 1997. New friends in Midsomer Murder make this show as good as ever. My wife and I can't wait for another DVD set. Neil is now the man.

5317446,2,B009D4RPIE,"My wife and I are huge fans of Midsomer Murders. We just watched all four episodes of Set 21 on Acorn Streaming.  We were most unhappy with the ""new"" show.  The new Barnaby seems aloof and has no sense of humor.  It was sad to see Jones be his second in command.  It would have been nice to see Jones move into the Barnaby role.  He has the personality and could have carried it off.  My personal choice would have seen the actor who played ""Dangerous Davies"" take over the lead role.

The stories were dull and uninteresting.

As an unwelcome parting shot; George the medical examiner anounced that he was retiring and that would be his last show. I used to purchase these sets on Amazon.  I have them all.  Sadly Set 20 was and will be my last purchase.

We miss our old friend John Nettles.

5317447,2,B009D4RPIE,"After being fans of this series for over 10 years, we sat down to watch this eagerly anticipated set/21 starring the new Inspector Barnaby.  We couldn't have been more bored.  It was lacking the usual charm, absorbing murders/stories, and, all 4 episodes were just plain boring. Two were remakes of similar stories from several years ago.  No chemistry, yet, between any of the characters including between Barnaby and his wife.  We liked her in the episode she was mainly featured, but there was just something lacking.  All 4 stories just plodded along.  Barnaby and his sidekick seemed to have good rapport and the series could improve over time, but do I want to waste more money waiting to see if that happens. The fact the new inspector has a background in psychology didn't add any pizzazz.  So many  familiar actors appeared in these 4 stories, previously seen in other episodes, but not even they seemed to be interested in acting out the stories!  Not sure we will be interested in any future series.  So sad, after this has been a great series for so many years.
Clarify further: Amazon is absolutely the best deal. If you can wait 3 months longer for a Midsomer set to be released rather than purchase from AcornOnline, which I did and paid $60, then wait.  I have previously waited and purchased from Amazon. Read the AcornOnline reviews (and Amazon reviews).  Over 100 viewers loved this new series/set 21 with Neil Dudgeon, who is a fine actor.  But we were disappointed. Maybe our expectations were too high!",1352937600,102,1524,4.770992366412214
5317448,5,B009D4RPIE,"Have loved this series since the first viewing.  Cast as well as writing are excellent.  Episodes are written well.  True that murders are the prime ingredient, but not presented with bloody details or gore.  Sorry to see that John Nettles' character is no longer in the series.  Hopefully, his replacement will be able to fill his shoes.  Recommended for mystery enthusiasts.",1352419200,8,376,5.081967213114754
5317449,5,B009D4RPIE,"Midsomer County is oddly rife with peculiar mysteries and creative demises, but DCI John Barnaby is as gifted with powers of keen observation as his cousin, retired DCI Tom Barnaby. Sykes, John Barnaby's expressive dog, is also welcome! Neil Dudgeon, as the new DCI Barnaby, is an excellent addition to Midsomer, with his capacity for nuance; humor and seriousness shadow his countenance. The Barnabys are an old Midsomer family; in this verdant environment there are often recurring family resemblances (recall the funereal duo in first Midsomer mystery, ""The Killings of Badger's Drift""). An amorous ""look-alike"" gardener was featured earlier in Midsomer, likely DCI John Barnaby is also good with plants. As always, the intrepid Jason Hughes is a wonderful foil as Detective Inspector Ben Jones, his wry humor adds another level of complexity to the series. The U.K. boasts many fine, underrated actors. Catch Dudgeon as a WWI vet/chauffeur in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mrs-Bradley-Mysteries-Series-1-Speedy-Death-The-Mrs-Bradley-Mysteries/dp/B0002XVRXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mrs. Bradley Mysteries - Series 1 (Speedy Death/The Mrs. Bradley Mysteries)</a>, which, despite the confusing title, is the complete set (no need to order a separate ""Series 2.""). We love the weird, unique Midsomer music, indicating that beneath Midsomer's quaintness, benign as a quivering vanilla blanc mange, danger lurks. Note the badger emblem on the police cars. In the U.K., coziness is often leavened with the macabre, like a doily blotched with tea, darkness lurks at the edges. And we love it. Brits have knack for mixing classic stories with ghoulish humor and sharp observations of the flawed human character. Historically, penny-dreadfuls were published at Christmastime, as in Robert Louis Stevenson and Charles Dickens. The denizens of the dangerous environs of Midsomer county inflict and suffer numerous creative malaises.

The four episodes in this collection are each 90 minutes long, and have helpful subtitles. But several have missteps, no fault of the cast, that may disappoint dedicated fans. The first episode, ""Death in the Slow Lane,"" is a somewhat disorienting introduction to DCI John Barnaby. Producer Brian True-May inflicts shrill drug taking schoolgirls on viewers. Where is screenwriter Tony Horowitz when you need him? Later, the third episode, ""Echos of the Dead,"" panders to graphic CSI style, featuring a dismembered female corpse, with a saw placed on her bare rear-end. This gratuitously lacks the dry humor of Midsomer classics, as in the memorable murder via trebuchet and wine bottles.

Death in the Slow Lane
DCI John Barnaby, a cousin of our original curmudgeon, is wonderfully played by Neil Dudgeon. And he has a dog companion, the emotive Sykes; England, this blessed plot, rife with delightful dogs and detectives. Midsomer's classic formula features charming villages with a high body-count. But this episode, written by Michael Aitkens, despite moments of great dialogue, is off-kilter. The trite titillation of chattering schoolgirls is a malformation of Midsomer, straining to be topical; a poor way to meet new DCI John Barnaby at work! Barnaby's relationship with DI Ben Jones (expertly played by the wry Welsh-humored Jason Hughes) is off to an uneven start. All is not well at a girls' boarding school. Was a past death really suicide? There are hints at some form of incest, a relatively (pun intended) common Midsomer sin. A local DJ is stabbed by a gorgeous red sports car prior to his judging a classic car show. His body being rolled-away on a gurney, weapon wobbling, is classic Midsomer. A humorous aspersion is cast at redheads/ginger, ""they are all sex-mad and ill-tempered."" The best scenes involve Barnaby being greeted as ""Tom,"" meeting his overly-friendly neighbors, and enjoying delightful conversations with his precocious dog.

Dark Secrets
This episode, again written by Michael Aitkens, again features quaffs of incest on the menu. But ""Dark Secrets"" boasts the classic Midsomer oeuvre viewers expect, with a rambling old manor amidst gorgeous English countryside The mansion is inhabited by eccentrics, William Bingham (Edward Fox) and his wife Mary (the wonderful Phyllida Law). They rattle about, subsiding on tea and pizza delivery. Our DCI John Barnaby's wife, Sarah (Fiona Dolman), arrives in Midsomer to find that her husband has neglected to unpack. She is the new head teacher at Causton Comprehensive, and receives an unenthusiastic welcome, though she finds a clever way to unpack. Meanwhile, after the body of a social worker is found floating in a river, the reclusive Bingham couple come under police scrutiny. Barnaby and Jones unearth scandalous family secrets, and decipher astronomical charts to discover the murderer. This episode continues a Midsomer theme: a generation went wrong in the 1960/70s, threw off Edwardian sensibilities, and replaced repression with indulgence, to the harm of future generations.

Echoes of the Dead
Despite beauty of Midsomer village Great Worthy, this episode, written by Peter J. Hammond, is like spoiled clotted cream. Producer Brian True-May goes awry with the second murder's exploitative, graphic ugliness; it has none of the macabre humor true to Midsomer's spirit. You know things are off when the dialogue descends to discussing ""butt-plugs."" Newly single Dianne Price is discovered strangled, dressed like a bride, and laid out in a bath. A lipstick-written warning is scrawled on the bathroom mirror. At first, all seems like vintage Misdomer. The incident spurs copycat wedding-themed murders. Barnaby and Jones investigate a host of suspects, including a corrupt ex-colleague of Ben's, an cop who runs a pub with a former brothel madam, who happens to be his wife. But (yet again) religious fanatics are the worst culprits. The detectives realize that the cases have eerie similarities to past notorious murders. If only they resembled Midsomer's infamous, but charming, macabre heritage.

Oblong Murders
The best of the lot; sharp dialogue stands out in this last episode, written by reliable Midsomer vet David Hoskins. The opening scenes wonderfully depict the world from a dog's eye-view. John Barnaby takes his dog Sykes for a ramble along a path, passing other dogs being walked along the way. Later, forensic medical specialist David Bollard (John Barnaby once called him bullock) asks Barnaby to help find Lucy Oliver, a daughter of his friends. She went missing after becoming involved with a secretive new-age cult, the Oblong Foundation, located at Malham Hall. Long-suffering DI Ben Jones is forced to forgo his vacation to go undercover among the cultists. Finally, viewers see his old humor and charm return (the prior episodes turned him dour). He discovers that the accidental deaths involving the previous owners of Malham Hall may have been murder. Jones copes with several eager females, while navigating the Oblong Foundation's philosophies (""be a tree"") promulgating free-love. He discovers money-laundering, and a secret relationship between an Oblong Foundation leader and the missing girl. Fortunately, Ben is intrepid and fast on his feet! And Sykes make some new friends.

Hopefully Midsomer will hit its stride, providing an exceptional cast with more worthy material. I also highly recommend the gritty Northumberland, U.K., mystery series, featuring the wonderful Brenda Blethyn:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vera/dp/B0050N0US4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vera</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vera-Set-2/dp/B008OTTTP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vera: Set 2</a>.",1352332800,116,7771,5.729636048526863

However, I have noticed a change in the last episodes that started in the last season that John Nettles was in - the stories have gotten darker and they are putting the characters in mortal danger only to be rescued at the last instant.  And, although there have been moments of comedy - there hasn't been the wry sense of humor that so many of the earlier episodes contained.

And I completely don't believe the starting antagonism that DS Jones has been showing.  He'd know that from his current rank he could only be promoted one level and that level would be too low to take over DCI Tom Barnaby's job.  And he would be too self-aware that he has yet to be right about a single murderer since this season started.",1436832000,,954,4.272222222222222

5317504,3,B009D4RPIE,"Change is difficult for some, but I thought I was past that. However, the new Midsomer Murders and the new Barnaby is taking much more time for me to acclimate than I thought.

Neil Dudgeon as Chief Inspector John Barnaby rankles somehow. Bringing in a new, unknown DCI would have been much better than a relative. I like the guy, he has an irony and sense of humor that make me smile. But, he is not the old Barnaby, not quite.  Jason Hughes as Detective Ben Jones seems much too old to be playing the bumbling young Detective. Too quick in his assessments and too quick with a wise crack. Someone younger would be more believable. In one case Barnaby calls Jones, who says he is in bed and not alone. Nothing was ever said again about that instance, and I thought how odd. This is a team who by the fourth episode seemed to hit some sort of stride, but I don't know that I will continue with this series.

The series has taken a 90 degree turn. The mysteries seem darker, the killings more violent, I gather that is our won't now, but not in Midsomer, please!  There are also seems to be an increase in supercilious characters in these
episodes, some very unlikable people.  Reading this over, I see I have been quick in my assessments. When the next series of episodes arrive, I will view again, and see if time changes my attitude.

He and Hughes perform the expected new-cop issues well but mesh by the fourth episode.  Without Tom Barnaby and his lovely family, however, MM has taken on a modernistic feel and lost all quaintness.  Not a problem for me.  A mystery is a mystery as long as it's performed and written well.  No cheating.  No suspects crawling out of the woodwork.

However this volume 21 was very disappointing I could not even get all the way through the first dvd, it was so uninteresting and slow moving that it just could not hold my attention.  It really is a shame because this was such an excellent series when Inspector Barnaby was the main character.

5317517,4,B009D4RPIE,"After reading all of the other reviews by Midsomer Murders fans, I put off even looking at Set 21 because it was going to be really bad. It is not the same as the other Midsomer Murders with Tom Barnaby, that everyone has grown to love, but it is not BAD. I could still watch it and accept it as being a bit different. The actor that plays John Barnaby - Neil Dudgeon, is not the same as John Nettles. John Nettles' swagger, knowing smile, sex appeal (yes even at such an advanced age. lol), are not the way Neil Dudgeon plays the part.  First you have to forget the slime bag gardener that Neil Dudgeon played in a previous episode of Midsomer Murders (it was only an acting part). Secondly you have to stop expecting him to be John Nettles.  Relax and enjoy his trying to fit into Midsomer. His companion Skype. The arrival of his wife in Midsomer and the easy loving relationship they appear to have.
I enjoyed watching the new Midsomer Murders, Off to buy the next series and see how it goes.",1398643200,,996,4.320855614973262
5317518,5,B009D4RPIE,I love the Midsomer Murders series. I can hardly wait for the latest DVDs to come out. And the great thing about them is that you can watch them over and over. The stories are very interesting and they do such a good job filming them.,1397606400,,234,4.108695652173913
5317519,4,B009D4RPIE,"The moment of truth has finally come (to North America, at least). In the UK, MIDSOMER MURDERS, the phenomenally successful mystery program that turns the idea of tranquil, peaceful rural England on its ear, has been continuing its success since the departure of the wonderful John Nettles as DCI Tom Barnaby. Devotees of the series will know that Nettles decided to leave the show and the producers chose to replace him with Neil Dudgeon as Toms cousin, John Barnaby. The previous set (Set 20) of MIDSOMER MURDERS released in North America by Acorn Media saw John Nettles final episodes. In the UK, viewers have had the opportunity for a few years now to appreciate the new blood on the program.

The response in the UK to Dudgeons character has been very positive and for good reason. The shows creators have found just the right balance in bringing John Barnaby into Midsomer, the fictional murder capitol of England. Wisely, Jason Hughes as Barnabys sidekick DS Ben Jones has been retained as has Barry Jackson (for now) as the Medical Examiner. These two characters give the show its obvious continuity from when Nettles was the star.

Understandably there are some ruffled feathers as they all get to know one another. This provides some of the fun watching the new episodes.

Particularly delightful is the new Barnabys dog, Sykes. Barnaby loves to talk to his faithful companion, particularly in the first episode before Johns wife arrives to take over being headmistress (Principal) of the local school. The scruffy terrier is adorable and always up for a little fun. In his moments, hes Costello to Dudgeons Abbott; a punchline is always safe in Sykes hands paws.

As for the mysteries themselves, the first two are top notch, with wonderful guest stars complementing the outstanding regular leads. Samantha Bond is back for her third guest-starring appearance in the first episode, Death in the Slow Lane. This episode also features a return to classic MIDSOMER form in the way it cleverly dispatches its first victim. Murder by Crankshaft, anyone? And mention must also be made of the classically beautiful model/actress Clara Paget doing an absolutely priceless turn as a stupidly spoiled young vamp. She clearly modeled the character after Paris Hilton, right down to the walk  now you already know how much you want her to get her comeuppance in the end!

Part of the enjoyment of these programs is the array of talent that appears. Edward Fox play an eccentric recluse in the second mystery, Dark Secrets. As always, he is sensational, with his distinct, drawn-out speech pattern emphasized to give added colour to his impressive characterization.

All is not well, however, and when we arrive at the third episode of this set, Echoes of the Dead, we are subjected to possibly one of the poorest Midsomer mysteries on offer. The occasional bad script can be forgiven, but in this case the sin is compounded by a return to a most troubling recurring characteristic about this (and other British) program(s): namely, the blatant anti-Christian tone. One could confidently place bets that whenever a character appears on MIDSOMER MURDERS who professes to be a Christian (not even a person of faith but specifically a Christian), they will turn out to be a nut case and/or the murderer. This is not only lazy writing, it is prejudice, pure and simple. MIDSOMER MURDERS is a great show, most of the time, but this propensity for perpetuating a negative stereotype is unacceptable. John Barnaby has already, in an earlier episode, announced that he does not believe in God, but his atheism has yet to be pursued in any meaningful way as an insight into the character, so who cares? Maybe Tom was an atheist too  he never said because it doesnt matter! Who cares unless it affects the way he solves a murder. Using such an obvious tell over and over in a mystery series is beyond boring, its insulting to the viewers intelligence. The attack on an identifiable group of people is inappropriate. The lack of effort in the writing is deeply disappointing. One can only hope theyve found some new writers.

The fourth episode in Set 21 is The Oblong Murders. This one is a lot of fun because DS Jones has a lot more to do than usual. He goes undercover to investigate the disappearance of a young woman who joined a cult. (If the shots the show normally aims at Christianity were aimed at fictional groups as in this episode, all would be well  actually funny and no one is specifically targeted.) This story isn't derailed by misplaced political correctness or soap-box mounting. It takes aim at pseudo-celebrity self-realization gurus spouting vague pop-psychology mumbo-jumbo to people with too much money and not enough sense. (Be your own tree!) Cosmo (DS Jones undercover pseudonym) and his new friend Blaze (Christine Bottomley, Hope Springs) battle the sinister and the insipid simultaneously in a twisted tale with the body count mounting practically in front of their eyes!

Jones has two beautiful women after him while pretending to be someone else and is quite exposed (saved only by tight editing) in a shower scene and is suitably confused, frustrated and uncomfortable, giving the episode that light-hearted touch that makes this cop show stand out from the crowd. This is most welcome as the overall flavour of these four episodes (some good, some not) is bleaker than what we have come to expect from the idyllic English countryside manifested in MIDSOMER MURDERS.

Well have to wait and see whether or not the darker tone prevalent in three of these four episodes is now the dominant theme. Nonetheless, MIDSOMER MURDERS will always be good entertainment (most of the time) and will undoubtedly have a loyal following, if only on the strength of its great characters. One must simply expect and accept some growing pains as the series undergoes such a major overhaul. It was never going to be easy to say goodbye to John Nettles. That much has always been obvious. A little patience is required at this juncture to give us all a chance to adjust.

Heres hoping that future episodes are more consistent than Set 21.",1397433600,3,6139,4.908389585342333

I was worried that the series might suffer without him, but Neil Dudgeon along with Jason Hughes is terrific. In fact, I love how subtle, intelligent, and refined his performances are in this new series. I also enjoy his interaction with Jason Hughes. The best part, however, is his family life. He has a wife who has chemistry with him, who has a life and career of her own, and who is modern. Joyce Barnaby and Cully were so predictable and anachronistic.
And Sykes the dog is a wonderful addition!! The British love their dogs as much as Americans so it is fun to have that warm addition!
The story telling is still first rate and the murders are as gruesome as ever. Barnaby and Jones are in step with their solutions.

Now, sadly, unlike most of the other reviewers, neither of us can seem to shake off the primary importance of Nettles, Wymark and Howard as essential personalities, as well as the disappearing English countryside scenery.

5317527,5,B009D4RPIE,"I'm going to give it 5 stars because the elements of good story telling are there and I like neil dudgeon though I think he was much more humorous in other series.  It's a little darker than Tom Barnaby's Midsomer.  There isn't as much humour.  The first few episodes see intent on reminding us that the new Inspector Barnaby has a degree in psychology and uses it.  The relationship between Jones and Barnaby is a little awkward even tense.  Too be expected if Jones thought he'd be promoted.  However, I miss the easy jovial yet professional camaraderie Tom and Jones had.  this series seems a little ""sexier"" - more references to Barnaby's marriage and sex life.

Overall, I was glad to watch it because Midsomer Murders is a series near and dear to me, and it was comforting to know they are continuing with it.  It remains to be seen what happens to the series.  I'm willing to give the new Inspector Barnaby a chance.

It definitely reflects a more current atmosphere.  The marital situation of 2 working professionals is interesting.  The Joyce and Cali side stories were growing tedious.  The new inspector seems more today!  He is a blend of instinct with modern methods.  There is now a psychological undercurrent that enhances the stories.  The new relationship between the two detectives gives the viewer a deeper glimpse into the characters.

To date, I have viewed all of them and enjoyed all of them, though some were a bit more better than others. They were all interesting in one way of another. This series that follows with cousin DCI John Barnaby does not stand up with the others. DCI John Barnaby is no replacement for DCI Tom Barnaby. The actor that portrays this new DCI is no replacement for John Nettles. I guess the series was going well and they didn't want to let it go just because Nettles left. However, they should have because this series leaves much to be desired now. Sorry, but I can't recommend this series now and won't be viewing anymore of these from now on.

The new series, thankfully, does not feature 'blondie' and that is one of the few pluses, however, if you are looking for intricate plots and shocking, eyebrow-raising murders, you should search elsewhere.  Oh, and another yawner is the frequent, but failing attempt to shock the viewer with deviant sexual behavior.

However, the writing has gone steadily downhill, failing the established standards for actors and crew. For me, the most enjoyable features of this series have been the plots and dialogue. Without these, the actors have little to work with. The murder in one of the episodes was an import from a particularly grisly scene in ""The Last King of Scotland.""

After reading some of the negative reviews of the ""new"" DCI Barnaby, I was hesitant to watch any of the new shows.  Boy, was I wrong to pay attention to the naysayers!  The new DCI John Barnaby character is precisely portrayed by Neil Dudgeon and the plots are as twisted and wonderful as ever. As much as I enjoyed the previous cast, I eagerly await each new episode and have yet to be disappointed. In my opinion, the negative reviews are simply misguided.",1375315200,3,632,4.517543859649122

And we haven't seen the next series yet. The dvds look great though. The series though is in it's fourteenth  year here so it's got a hard job to keep interesting for it's viewers. It is doing what it can here but I didn't expect john nettles here anymore. It's been renewed for a 2013-14 series so it will be back for at least that long.

We present this information to display our knowledge and experience with ""Tom Barnaby"", his family and his Detective Sergeants.  We were surprised at the abrupt change in the ""Fit For Murder"" episode of Set 20, although admittedly we had heard that John Nettles would be retiring.  Taking a chance, we decided to order Set 21 to try and connect with Neil Dudgeon and be able to establish a new relationship.  We found ""Death in the Slow Lane"" to be a less than inspiring introduction to ""John Barnaby"" and were disappointed with the role of ""Ben Jones"" who now appears less competent than his character has been portrayed in previous sets.  This character set-back continues in ""Dark Secrets"" and we can only hope that his character will become on par with prior episodes.  ""John Barnaby"" has been introduced as if he has something on his mind other than the cases presented in the first two episodes, and the character lacks the fervor of ""Tom Barnaby"".  We have not yet viewed either ""Echoes of the  Dead""  or ""The Oblong Murders"" because of our lessened enthusiam.

Now Jason Hughes has left as DC Ben Jones, so I figure there's nothing left without him or John Nettles - the producers really should have done whatever it took to keep John Nettles - he was a priceless gem and the show doesn't have any life anymore without him!

Not the same comfy feeling as in the previous sets when inspector Barnaby was played by John Nettles.
The new inspector Barnaby is not as interesting. He doesnt seem as intelligent. Is it why Detective Sergeant Ben Jones has more lines in this new set? Also, the story lines are not as captivating in this set.

5317606,5,B009D4RPIE,"Both of us have enjoyed all the previous seasons of Midsomer, with Tom Barnaby and crew, but we were beginning to feel a certain sense of tiredness, and we wondered in light of that, how the series would carry on with Tom's cousin John, whom we had met once before. Whew! This reminds me of Lewis picking up from Morse...completely different shows of course, but the feeling of success in keeping the same essential setting and familiar elements, but changing out the lead detectives in a satisfying way, and in that way being able to go on into the foreseeable future as a great series.
We thought it was fun to watch John Barnaby take over the reigns and get moved in and also to watch his interactions with Jones, who is completely put off his stride by this change of superior officer, who works in a very different manner from Tom. His humor is subtle, and we love the scenes with his dog, Sykes, a great addition. (Death in the Slow Lane is the first one, and the most troubled for the Jones/Barnaby relationship. We liked the mystery itself which has to do with a classic car show, as well as all the background storyline of just getting into the new series.)
Dark Secrets--wonderful! This has Edward Fox in it as nutty old recluse, and he is always fun to watch. We were also relieved to know that we don't have to even think about John's wife being like Joyce, or anything of that nature. Let the old series suffice. We liked it, and we will watch those shows and enjoy them, when Joyce got involved in almost every oddball thing in the county. Sarah Barnaby having her own career keeps her plenty busy and out of the way most of the time.
Echoes of the Dead...grim, and well, it is actually very typical of a Midsomer murder. The sort of thing which this series thrives on and which makes us joke around about English villages being so dangerous. (This series does have an unseemly number of murders in Midsomer County, and they are mostly clever and bizarre, which does give one pause.)
The Oblong Murders is a real treat to watch as DS Jones goes undercover in a new age cult, the Oblong Foundation, on a mission to find out what has happened to the daughter of Dr Bullard's friends. He is not the only one sneaking around that place, but we don't know for sure what the other shady characters are up to, so not only is it amusing to watch Jones undercover, but there is this interesting tension, as well as a good mystery.
We are eagerly awaiting the next set, and are very pleased with the new Barnaby in town. (We hope Tom & Joyce are enjoying their well deserved vacation, wherever that may be...well away from murder and mayhem.)",1363996800,2,2646,4.457731958762887

However, with some misgivings and trepidation, I ordered Set 21, and my husband and I started watching John Barnaby settle into Midsomer.  John doesn't try to be Tom, and that's probably a good thing.  The plots are still good.  DCI Jones and the good medical examiner are great characters.  I just pre-ordered Set 22.

I am not a religious prude, but, John's faith has nothing to do with what I want to see in a murder mystery.  I think it would be smart on the producers part, to not let ""Midsomer Murders"" become a platform for religion or political views.

5317633,3,B009D4RPIE,"I have good news and bad news about the new Inspector Barnaby series.

First, the good news.  I think that Neil Dudgeon is wonderful as Inspector Barnaby.  He is engaging, clever, and adorable.  His wife and his dog are equally appealing.  Moreover, by the time the viewer gets to Oblong Murders (the best of the four new episodes), he has worked out his relationship with Jones, and the two have become a team.

Now, the bad news.  The plots of these new episodes are truly terrible.  They are starting to resemble the old TV series ""The Wild, Wild West"" in placing Inspector Barnaby into ridiculous and almost farcical physical peril, equally absurdly resolved.  With the possible exception of the fourth episode, they rely exclusively on homicidal maniacs, although even in the fourth episode the culprit was far from rational.  A further flaw is that Inspector Barnaby does not detect so much as he trips over the culprit, often at great risk to his physical well-being.  (Why the presence of a safe implies the existence of an IOU I cannot imagine.)

Please, screenwriters, get yourself some plots.  Find some relatively obscure, no-longer-copyrighted Golden Age mysteries and use them as the basis for village mysteries in the true Midsomer tradition.  Otherwise, the series is well on its way to becoming repetitive and ridiculous.  If this trend continues, not even the presence of Neil Dudgeon will be able to redeem it.",1361059200,2,1429,4.945378151260504

5317639,3,B009D4RPIE,"This is not a continuation; it is a new series. Depending on how open you are to change this could be great news or a really bad one. John Barnaby, the main character (Neil Dudgeon) proves himself without a doubt. You cannot compare him to John Nettles/ Tom Barnaby as the whole setup and experience is different.
The writer's efforts to make the new seasons more up-to-date failed. The wife (Fiona Dolman, an attractive actress) is busier than her husband; and she does not contribute to the plot; even as it is now a day with sex scenes once a week/15 days/a month??  A much better job is performed by the dog - his real companion. Are the writers trying to be politically correct with female audience??
They spend too much time reconstructing gruesome killing scenes (worse than CSI) reaching a point of disgusting when trying to explain who did it and how it was done. We do not watch these series to enjoy the killings; we enjoy a well balanced Poirot and new crime mysteries with mix weirdness and a bit of macabre. We were just fine with and old fashion series behind the times (even the cars and brand changed!)
They are pretty much eliminating all characters as the forensic is leaving; the lady sergeant (?) that used to work with Ben is gone. Unless they add more brain to Ben and they let him have a real romance (sex?) with a real character, they should get rid of him as well and start over as they did with his predecessors.

Inspector Morse, for example, was never so antagonistic as when he was dealing with a priest or minister.  Even though the earlier Midsomers had a definite anti-religious bent, Tom Barnaby was respectful of every character.  So while the non-acting creators had an anti-religion agenda, at least the major character was open-minded.  In ""Death in the Slow Lane"" we were presented with John Barnaby, who with death seemingly imminent, smugly admits to the villain that he does not believe in God.  The cold-blooded killer, of course, states that he does believe in God.  Neither statement was necessary dramatically or prefaced by any well-balanced argument about religious beliefs or lack thereof earlier in the episode.  I am not particularly religious, but I find this bigotry on the part of artists or anyone else to be reprehensible.",1360368000,7,942,5.24

5317663,5,B009D4RPIE,"As a very long-time fan of the British murder/mystery series ""Midsomer Murders"", I purchased Season twenty-one (21), of the series, with some trepidation because of John Nettles' retirement from the series.  Having watched ""Midsomer Murders"" for so many years (since its inception) with John Nettles as DCI Tom Barnaby who became (with his wonderful mellow ways) like a beloved relative to me.  Now, of course, that is foregone with his departure and that now his character has been replaced by his cousin, in the series, DCI John Barnaby.

Season Twenty-one (21) of ""Midsomer Murders"" splendidly introduces to the viewing audience, the ""new"" DCI OF John Barnaby's sleuthing skills with four (4) finally written, directed and acted ninety (90) minute episodes that, per usual, ""paint"" the cozy village of Midsomer as beautiful and peaceful on the surface while, at the same time, below the surface the Midsomer village and its surroundings are rife with many  scandals even murders.
DCI John Barnaby, as his cousin Tom, has keen insights and detective skills well able to solve the many unfortunate demises of Midsomer's inhabitants.  Neil Dudgeon splendidly acts the ""new"" DCI with ""dry"" humor and a very mellow demeanor talking to his very smart and also very mellow dog Sykes while seeking some guidance from him. In Season twenty-one (21), I really liked John Barnaby (as acted by Dudgeon) while still adoring John Hughes as his assistant, Ben Jones along with John Barnaby's dog and I certainly plan on watching  subsequent episodes.

If you've previously enjoyed ""Midsomer Murders"" feel free to purchase Season twenty-one (21) of the series because it continues a very fine tradition of darn good murder/mysteries that are greatly acted and directed.  My ""love affair"" with the series continues.",1359590400,2,1801,5.2076124567474045
5317664,3,B009D4RPIE,"It can be difficult to come up with commentary on such a long-running and successful series as Midsomer Murders. It is only with a shake-up or great change that a reviewer like me can find something new to say.

Fortunately, with the US release of Midsomer Murders Set 21, just such a shake-up is in the offing. Neil Dudgeon takes on the role of DI John Barnaby, replacing the beloved Tom Barnaby (John Nettles). Herein lies a character twist. John Barnaby does not have the same affability as Tom. John is much more direct in his style. Where Tom was a country detective who wouldn't bend to pressure, John is a city detective who plays his cards close. Where Tom would have a revelation, John seems to have the answers already, only waiting on proofs of his suspicions before acting. John is younger, brasher than Tom was and his character rubs people, especially Sergeant Ben Jones (Jason Hughes) the wrong way.

This, I think, is why some viewers in the UK have not liked the change. There is a significant divergence from the style of the John Nettles led series in Set 21, though indications from across the pond lead me to believe that Set 21 is something of an aberration. It seems that the production team behind Midsomer Murders was trying to find the voice with which the character and tone of the new John Barnaby-led series. The result is a mixed bag in Set 21, as some of the tales hearken back to the nuanced, lighthearted mysteries of the series and some take a much, much darker tone.

The first episode is ""Death in the Slow Lane."" At a local private girls school, a classic car show is raising funds. Former students of this political/business preparatory school are returning to show off their success via their expensive cars. Locals too, are getting in on the act, as Ben Jones joins a team restoring an old racing car discovered with the decomposed body of an apparent suicide. Ire is raised the constabulary when Barnaby questions Jones' closing of the suicide case. Jones begins a sort of class warfare in retaliation, constantly and consistently mocking Barnaby's degree in psychology. Then, when a local radio star is killed with the crank handle of a classic car, Barnaby and Jones must uncover the culprit. Like a classic Tom Barnaby case, it is the past that informs the future, leading to the uncovering of the murderer.

I found the choice of Jones and Barnaby getting off on the wrong foot a good one in the sense that it creates interesting character conflict. However, the problem with it becomes that then Barnaby seems aloof and standoffish - making him the bad guy, since the viewer is already familiar with and liking Ben Jones. Overall, though, viewers will be treated with the familiar formula of red herrings and mysterious past we have come to know and love. The only thing missing is the quirky village characters (though John Barnaby might be considered one) but the stories have long been straying from their inclusion anyway.

Quirkiness returns with ""Dark Secrets"". An elderly, rich, and reclusive couple and their free spirit art colony neighbors become the targets of investigation when a social services investigator is found dead in a stream between their lands. It appears that the now conservative elderly couple were once 1960s flower children and that they are hiding some secrets from those days. What is the connection with this couple and the art colony? Who among them had the most motive to kill? Barnaby and Jones must unravel tangled histories and deal with the drug-addled memories of the couple and the outright antagonism of the art colony.

I liked this episode in that it includes the forgotten past motif as well as quirky characters in the persons of the elderly couple. The incongruity of the current style of their lives and their personal pasts also creates dramatic tension. More importantly is the interesting look into where even the most free love, free spirit of lifestyle choices will draw the moral line and what it is that might make them cross it.

Perhaps the darkest Midsomer Murders I have ever viewed, ""Echoes of the Dead"" is reminiscent more of Wire in the Blood or Waking the Dead than Murder, She Wrote. There is none of the lightheartedness endemic to most Midsomer Murders episodes. The whole episode is cast in an eerie, dark light. Whereas the contrast between daylight detective work and the evil of murder by night usually prevents Midsomer from being too depressing, ""Echoes of the Dead"" is darker in tone and color (it appears to be winter in Midsomer, including gray clouds as background) and leaves chills running down your back.

In this story, a young woman, newly single, is found drowned in her bathtub dressed in a wedding gown. This style of murder has occurred before, so Barnaby and Jones must deal with the potential of a returned killer along with the idea of a copycat. Suspects include a pub owner drummed out of the police force (and a personal antagonist for Ben Jones), a hardware store owner, the owner of the rental property where the woman was killed, a gas station attendant, even the dead girl's roommate. Then more bodies begin piling up and it seems that what Barnaby and Jones assumed about the killer is all wrong.

There are some unusually grim and scary scenes in this tale.  It appears the production team tried to see if Midsomer Murders viewers would tolerate a darker, more sinister cast to the whole tone of the show. The style of ""Echoes of the Dead"" is not what you might expect as the oddities of the villagers are given a sinister cast rather than a humorous one, and the settings are starker, more modern, and grayer - making this a episode akin to Wallander rather than its namesake.

Jones goes undercover to investigate a new-age cult in ""The Oblong Murders"" when one of its members disappears. At first it seems the cult might have been responsible, but as Jones gets embroiled in the cult and its ways he finds that someone within the organization may be seeking their own ends. New information also leads Barnaby to suspect that previous deaths may not be what they seem. The drama of this episode is in Jones' lack of comfort with his undercover role, and in his nearly getting caught out several times.

Midsomer Murders Set 21 is all about Neil Dudgeon finding the right character for John Barnaby that will keep viewers entertained while not being a direct copy of John Nettles' John Barnaby. I think Dudgeon pulls it off. The introduction of his wife in ""Dark Secrets"" and his repartee with the dog Sykes humanizes him without making him a carbon copy of the previous Barnaby.

The production team is also trying to discover the new voice of the Midsomer Murders series. The effect is that in this set you have some episodes that are the expected lighthearted (semi-)village mysteries and at least one that takes a page from the playbook of its darker cousins. However, I think by ""The Oblong Murders"" the characters and the style have settled into their roles, and we can expect that though their have been some cast changes, the episodes in the future are going to be good mysteries with a touch of darkness rather than police procedurals with a touch of comedy.

Cautions: ""Echoes of the Dead"" and ""The Oblong Murders"" contain nudity and/or frightening imagery.",1359504000,4,7310,4.754731861198739

Neil is a fine actor and Jason Hughes is wonderful as Jones.  Nope, it's the producer, director and writers that are the problem.  Midsomer has always been tongue-in-cheek bizarre, featuring every deadly sin and vice you can name.  But the personal morals and beliefs of the powers that be and writers were never so shoved down the viewers throat as they have become the last few series.  (Okay, John Barnaby is a man of science and hates God with a passion, how many times does he need to tell us this??!!) Wow, what they do to religious faith is just ugly, prejudiced and unnecessary. Even the non-religious have been commenting all over forums about the overt and vile attack on religion (particularly Christianity).  Start at the very beginning with the first episode and work your way through...you'll see an obvious downward spiral in recent years especially.  While the show has always dealt with incest, adultery, sexual fetish, and more...it was at least done in good taste (for the most part).  These last few episodes just made me squirm with discomfort and embarassment for the poor actors. I've been a long time fan and am just sick at what has become of one of my favorite shows. In short, they've jumped the shark and have lost their way. I've abandoned ship and started watching Inspector Lewis.  Good stuff, let's see how long that lasts before suits and writers destroy it, too.

5317671,1,B009D4RPIE,"I agree with so many disappointing reviews of the latest series.  We were so looking forward to seeing this one, altho had reservations about the new ""Barnaby"". The entire series is BORING and the last episode has a boring, dotty old couple (why I don't know).  Nettles had charm that came across to the viewers and was entertaining; this new Barnaby is a real bore and hope this series will end with memories of Tom and not John!  It was really painful to watch.  I was able to rent this DVD from my local library so that was a plus, but I doubt that I will watch any more of Midsomer Murders.  We are going to begin watching the series from the beginning and hope to forget ""John"".  I hope SGT Jones has the sense to get out of this program as soon as he can or at least get a transfer to London! The characters all seemed nasty and that didn't add to the plot lines of this DVD. The producers have also added a dog (as if the program wasn't already a dog) for Barnaby which is just a pest.",1359072000,10,992,4.140625

5317673,4,B009D4RPIE,"Some of the gratuitous, anti-Christian drivel in a couple of episodes detracts from the enjoyment of this genre.  The rather juvenile plots equate a belief in a Christian God with deviant wants and behaviors while the adult, rational characters are declared atheists.  OHHHHH Pleaseeeeeeee!!!!.  I thought this goofy, half-educated, sophomoric argument went out of style 30 years ago.  But I guess some writers are still in a backwater.  The acting and directing is great as well as the setting.  Truly enjoy the Barnaby family!!",1358812800,,529,5.238095238095238

5317675,3,B009D4RPIE,"Like some others, I was so eager to see Set 21 that I was willing to pay extra to get it early from Acorn.  I should have waited.  The autumn scenery is beautiful and the color fantastic. And the village characters, played by topnotch character actors, are wonderful.  These, however,  are the highpoints.  The new Chief Inspector Barnaby seems to have only two major expressions, stone faced or a somewhat loopy smile.  He really takes being laidback to a new dimension.  As for Ben, what happened?  In the first three episodes he seems like an entirely different person.  It is only during the fourth episode that the old Ben  re-emerges.  The woman DC who was a real charmer as a member of Tom Barnaby's team has disappeared altogether.  The first two scripts are rather, for want of a better word, icky.  The third is almost grotesque, and John Barnaby doesn't really solve it.  One of the characters just happens to see the murderer attacking his next victim and runs for help.  The fourth is the best of the lot except for the announcement at the end that George Bullard will be ""retiring.""  I love the series and am willing to see what Set 22 will have to offer.  Surely it can only improve, otherwise I will just be content watching all the previous Midsomer Murders and visiting with Tom, Joyce, Cully (and even Gavin Troy).",1358726400,5,1333,4.604255319148936

If you are into mysteries, I highly suggest you get the entire series. You won't be bored. There is comedy and compassion in them. Extremely entertaining!

5317690,3,B009D4RPIE,"Not sure if it's the change in cast or the directing, but this set was disappointing.  I have all prior U.S. sets, and know there are some episodes better than others, but three of the four episodes in this set seemed dull in comparison.  For some reason, Ben's character has been ""dumbed down,"" and the new ""cousin"" DCI Barnaby seems to have one facial take - speechless and with a hapless, goofy smile.  I miss the faster pace, quick wit, and seasoned characters (not only are Tom, Joyce and Cully gone, but so is the delightful young female detective) of past seasons.  Appearances by a number of favorite, seasoned actors in individual episodes helps.  If you are a big Midsomer fan it may still be worth owning, but if you are new to the series, don't judge it by this set - you'll be better served by purchasing sets from the beginning of the series, or past sets with ""Tom and Ben"" who had great chemistry.",1358640000,2,913,4.475903614457831

But we were getting tired of Tom Barnaby and were curious to see what a new face would bring to an old show. We were delighted. John Barnaby is very different from his cousin Tom and in many ways much more interesting. He is more cerebral, which is not a bad thing, and convinces the viewer that he is giving deep thought to the cases he is trying to solve. His attractive, lively wife is a considerable improvement over Joyce who always struck me as a bit vapid. The direction and writing seem sharper as well, though we are still treated with panoramic views of the beautiful English countryside and the delightful small villages of Midsomer. All in all, we were very pleased with the changes and look forward to seeing more of the""new"" Barnaby.",1358380800,4,850,4.490322580645161
5317694,1,B009D4RPIE,"I was getting slightly bored with John Nettles in the past couple of series, and the story line was going downhill fast. So I was hoping the new Barnaby would be a fresh new beginning with new writers. BOY WAS I WRONG! Just watched the first 2 mysteries with Neil Dudgeon & he is nothing what I had hoped for. What has happened to this series?? There was something nice in #2, and that was Julian Ovenden. I just bought his new vocal CD, can't wait to get it. Julian was also in Foyle""s War, Andrew. Getting back to Midsomer Murders.....how about putting some mystery into the mystery??? Seems all we get is sex & more sex. The newer sets have subtitles. Also, the best part of #21 with Neil Dudgeon was 1. Jones & 2. the new dog.",1358294400,8,730,4.258992805755396
5317695,3,B009D4RPIE,"Midsomer Murders used to provide a mystery to unravel at a slow, leisurely pace amid the lovely setting of an English village and its eccentric inhabitants.  Murder was the propelling force for action, but the real focus was on characterization, personal interaction, the setting and the culture of the English village as interpreted in the series.  In particular, the viewer normally faced with the carnage of popular movies and television could find respite with a cerebral journey as Barnaby and Jones unravelled the mystery of the day.  Enter  Season 21 of Midsomer and the gruesome visage of a dismembered body in Echoes of the Dead and giggling,  invasive school girls in Death in the Slow Lane.  Dark Secrets fared a little better but salacious elements,  gratuitous sex and incest, occupied center stage too readily and too much.  I have not viewed The Oblong Murders yet,  so perhaps all is not lost if it contains some saving grace.

Ironically, the formidable acting skills of Neil Dudgeon as Chief Inspector John Barnaby and Jason Hughes as Detective Ben Jones are apparent,  but the characters they play are not the Jones of yore or the new Barnaby introduced before the departure of John Nettles.  They are strangers.  They are not the Midsomer inhabitants we have come to know.  The medical examiner, Dr. George Bullard, played by Barry Jackson also suffers character misalignment.  In Series 21 he seems be less inquisitive and now ready to accept any answer.  His rhetorical bantering formerly appreciated by viewers is lost.  The close family unit of Joyce (Jane Wymark), Cully (Laura Howard) and Tom Barnaby (John Nettles) that gave warmth and gentleness in the world of law enforcement and crimes has disappeared.  The caring between John Barnaby and his wife seems real, but it is more visceral than the warm fuzzies of Tom and Joyce and the love of child and parents.

I do hope the writers and producers reexamine the best elements of previous Midsomer series and reinstate what made the series so well appreciated by viewers---the caress of the camera on the scenery, the uniqueness of quirky inhabitants, the caring and interaction of the characters, the culture of the village life and the humanity of all.  It was decidedly NOT gratuitous violence and sex, gruesome visuals and intellectual sparsity.

5317696,1,B009D4RPIE,"I knew a while back, there was going to be serious issues. First, the last 3-4 seasons have been boring, almost a struggle to watch them. As if the original writers of the series was sick and  ghost writers put in their place till Barnaby retire. Well, here comes the big day, package arrives, I get ready to go through all four shows in one night. What happens, I am so easily distracted that it took me 2 days to finish ONE story. I start to watch a second one and cannot get interested. Actually stop it after 15 minutes and put in one of the others, don't recall what distracted me, (maybe signing for a package), but never finished that one. Fell asleep on my final attempt, to see if it was me, Well the housekeeper usually sits down with me, she got up to finish chores. Asked her if she wanted to take the DVDs home and watch it with her daughter. They came back the next day. Finally I go to my elderly mother, gave her the box and explained what was happening. Well, she says she does not want them, they don't hold her interest. I felt DCI John Barnaby was not a strong leading character. His role being laid back should of have stronger supporting actors around him. Neither characters were interesting, driven, ""We will get to the bottom this"". I am sad, actually in morning. This was one of several Series that got me thru 11 months of hospital and nursing home stays. When the ""Morse (John Thaw) series ended with Morse's death, they smoothly promoted DS (Detective Sergeant) Robert Lewis to Inspector and DS James Hathaway becomes his permanent bagman. I have truly seen how important it is to have the correct leading actor for a role, a good story line, the best script writers, and the best supporting actors, and casting for the role. T series. In this series forced ending changes, perhaps Inspector Barnaby should have just retired with his wife Joyce having all kinds of things for him to do around the house. e.g. Adding on a guest room, closing in that screened patio. Then they find out his newlywed daughter and husband will being moving in with them until their financial situation improves, just a few months. But then his daughter gets some surprising news from a pregnancy test that was routinely performed for new role she just was chosen for.

5317712,5,B009D4RPIE,"With the loss of our original Barnaby and the replacement by another actor in the role of his cousin, I was kind of writing this series off.  It is rare when a tv series can recover when the lead actor quits. Much to my surprise though, the new actor who becomes the lead, as Barnaby's policeman cousin, is up to the task and makes a very smooth transition into the lead role. Thankfully we still had Ben as his sidekick so we didn't have to start from zero with new actors.

The major factor which continues though is the very high quality of the scripts.  The writers remain true to the original spirit of the series, including the macabre sense of humor about this bucolic section of England which is unbelievably murderous and bloody.  Let's not forget it is also witty in that very dry yet utterly wacky UK way.

I really enjoyed the small touches too, such as Ben undercover in a new age colony and the new Barnaby finding a dog care provider.

When I saw ""Death in the Slow Lane,""  I was pleasantly surprised.  Dudgeon, was outstanding. The script was excellent.

It also has that necessary bit of comedy I like thrown into a mystery series. It covers the personal life of the main character, without detracting one iota from the main plot, and even includes Barnaby's family in the mystery now and then. The focus is on the interrelations between the characters rather than on the blood and gore. A highly enjoyable procedural for the whole family.",1354060800,12,675,4.777777777777778

The third episode was actually TERRIBLE, with a scary murdering psychopath making it pure HORROR without any of the usual bantering humor and character byplays which were the ESSENCE of the series before they switched-out the major lead character. The supporting actor, Jason Hughes, soldiers on bravely as Detective Jones, but must do most of the heavy lifting. The new Det. Barnaby is a good actor with a very badly written part to play. He does a good job of it, but the writing is just too awful for anyone to deal with. Or to watch. That being said, the first two episodes are an OK transition, with some of th4e humor and lightness to balance out the character of the series as originally done, but what you get is erractic writing. The new wife and dog are thinly sketched in and some of the later epsiodes start catching up with the humor to some extent, but the thrill that characterized the madcap series is GONE.
