2983519,5,B000WMA6HI,"Fox is certainly sticking its neck out with this uber-large uber-expensive release that has been talked about and expected for over a year. John Ford's career at Fox spanned thirty years and most of his best non-John Wayne films were made there. I don't provide much more than what came out in the press release below, mainly either because these films haven't been seen for years or they have been in wide release and even on DVD and their contents are very commonly known.

Just Pals (1920)- only 50 minutes long, stars Buck Jones as a small town fellow who befriends a homeless boy.

3 Bad Men (1926) - stars George O'Brien in a saga of three outlaws of the wild west who become protectors of a little girl after her mother is killed. Sports some of Ford's great scenic long shots that his westerns are known for.
Feature film with Dolby 5.0 Surround Sound and Spanish/French subtitles

Four Sons (1928) - Three German brothers enlist in the German army during WWI, the fourth goes to America.
Feature film with Dolby Digital 5.1 sound and Spanish/French subtitles

Hangman's House (1928) - screen debut of John Wayne stars Victor McLaglan in a saga set in Ireland. A predecessor to ""The Informer"" this time McLaglan is the hero.
Feature film with Dolby 5.0 Surround Sound and Spanish/French subtitles

Previously listed films are all silents and can be purchased as a 5-set in John Ford's Epic Silent Collection, due out the same date as this large set.

Born Reckless (1930) - the early problems of sound in movies, and in particular dialogue, plague this tale of a gangster sentenced to fight in the war.
Feature film with English Mono and Spanish/French subtitles

Up The River (1930) - More early sound problems in which singing and dancing (not done very well) are inserted into a film that has the only mutual appearance of Spencer Tracy and Humphrey Bogart. No early talkie was complete without a musical number.

Judge Priest (1934) - stars Will Rogers as a southern Judge who enjoys taffy pulls and croquet when not on the bench.

The World Moves On (1934)- moves from reconstruction to the depression much like the British-made Cavalcade did, except that film took on a much smaller slice of time.
Feature film with English Mono and Spanish/French subtitles

Steamboat Round The Bend (1935) - stars Will Rogers (already on DVD) The final collaboration between Rogers and Ford is perhaps the best. Rogers plays a man going up and down the Mississippi on an old steamboat charging the local population admission to look at the wax figures he is carrying. He plans to use the money he raises to hire a lawyer to free his nephew from a serious charge.

The following titles will be available individually that were not previously available on DVD: When Willie Comes Marching Home, The Iron Horse, Hangman's House, 3 Bad Men, Up The River, and The Prisoner Of Shark Island. There are also 3 smaller sets of Ford classics, Ford silents, and Ford comedies. Thus there is something in this release for every budget.

Some parting words... If you are a fan of classic films and DVD sets and you can possibly afford it, then BUY THIS SET. Fox has taken a very big chance on releasing such an expensive package. If it flops we've probably seen the last of such an extra-laden classic volume from Fox. Studios are out to make money. If they can do it by restoring and releasing the classics with all the trimmings (this set) they will. If they can do it by releasing schlock such as ""The Best of Survivor"" and ""300"" they'll do that. If Ford at Fox flops it's a sign that the money is in the latter business model. In the business ethics of America, when art comes up against profit, I think you know what always wins. Let's show Fox they can have both and maybe some day we'll have the Holy Grail of classic Fox sets - Borzage at Fox. One can only hope!",1191369600,137,9822,5.1565053425518546

2983533,1,B000WMA6HI,"Once again Fox gives us damaged discs due to dumb, careless packaging. These classic films deserve better! Every one of the discs in my set had scratches due to the style of packaging. I give the films 5 stars. The quality control I give 1 star.

2983534,4,B000WMA6HI,"Even a Chinese audience like me would have known JOHN FORD as one of the greatest directors of all-time. Four-time-winning of Academy Awards for Best Director, he's created a large bundle of masterpieces in B&W film history. This Boxset contains the full works during Ford's age when working at 20th Century Fox. The reason I brought down a star is that the package style of the boxset-it can't be more protective to the disc as I expected. Besides, YOUNG MR. LINCOLN in it is only the film, without any special fatures in the former CRITERION edition, maybe due to the limit of copyrights? Who knows?
However, the service of AMAZON.com was truly acceptable. The whole boxset was brand new when I received it, which is hard to believe for a parcel that had crssed the Pacific...Hmm, but it's cost my whole month's salary. Dinner's been cancelled.",1239840000,13,846,4.801369863013699

2983536,5,B000WMA6HI,"being a huge john ford fan i was so excited about this collection being released. the only way i had ever seen so many of these films was on vhs tapes i recorded off of amc about 10 years ago when they had a john ford film festival to promote film preservation. seeing them on dvd in much better quality has been wonderful. i thought the chances of many of the silents ever being released were slim. three bad men , four sons , hangman's house are all amazing! the will rogers films are all great. prisoner of shark island is a personal favorite of mine as is pilgrimage. all of this and the immortal films like how green was my valley ,young mr. lincoln, grapes of wrath , my darling clementine! buy this set now! i will say that the way fox attached the discs to the packaging was idiotic and it is difficult to remove the discs but don't let that stop you from the sheer enjoyment of watching the work of one of america's greatest artists.",1224201600,6,942,4.268156424581005
2983537,1,B000WMA6HI,"this is a collection of great films in the most horrilbe package that could possible be designed. the box is badly sized, extremely heavy and utterly unnecessary. the way the dvd's are packaged within the box is sheer idiocy: suspended (or not) on weird, gel-like, rubber spindles that make dvd removal and replacement extremely difficult. additionally, fox was too cheap to put each film on its own dvd, and the packaging has no labeling, so one is also faced with the prospect of trying to read the miniscule printing around the spindle hole on the dvd.

overall, this idiot collection offers yet more proof that sonny bono hit that tree a few years too late.

the modern day fox company doesn't deserve to have the rights to these pictures under its control. this is particularly true as one discovers how little care fox took of the negatives and original prints, and how indebted we are to the universities and museums that preserved this stuff.

this box is an utter and complete waste of money.",1212969600,21,1001,4.741379310344827

2983540,5,B000WMA6HI,"A superb andmonumental collection of the great Irish American director's work with a single studio from silent days with the William Fox Studios to sound days with 20th Century Fox, a fruitful collaboration with Producer Darryl F. Zanuck that yielded such masterworks as THE IRON HORSE, FOUR SONS, PILGRIMAGE, STEAMBOAT AROUND THE BEND, YOUNG MR LINCOLN, GRAPES OF WRATH and MY DARLING CLEMENTINE etc... The delight is in these films and also in the lesser known works, including his WWII documentaries BATTLE OF MIDWAY, DECEMBER 7TH etc., which add to the richness of the package... Henry Fonda is the star of choice in the 1940's, and John Wayne is not to be found in any on the 24 films... Highly recommended!",1199664000,3,712,4.892561983471074
2983541,1,B000WMA6HI,"This set is impressive, no doubt. The collection of films is fantastic; the packaging looks nice, but it's all over the internet: the way the discs are secured damages them.

My set arrived-- with all of the discs on their spindles appropriately-- and EVERY ONE had significant scratches due to the method by which they were SCREWED ON to the spindles.

Were I the only person with this issue, I wouldn't score this set so poorly, but I have talked to dozens of people who purchased the set. Only ONE received his without significant scratching. I've tried contacting Fox, but they have been no help at all.",1199404800,73,607,4.663551401869159
2983542,3,B000WMA6HI,"Hi Folks,

I bought this set...even though I own most of the strongest films in the collection as any true movie or Ford fan would...they are simply classics. I'm writing to tell the curious what the extra stuff is...and frankly, its not much. The smaller sets available are much better deals for the Ford novice.  This set does  contain Tobacco Road (which I'm sure will be out on its own soon) and a few other oddities that may or may not make it on their own but the packaging is overly large to accomodate the hardback book..which is really the only true extra item in here...and while its a really nice book , I doubt anyone would like to pay 2-3 hundred bucks for it.  You can collect most of the relevant films in the smaller sets MUCH less expensively and the documentary DVD which is superb...is available on its own as well as in the classic set with Grapes/CLementine/How Green and Drums along the Mohawk...and You get cover art etc...this set is sadly lacking in such as the DVDs are in a big book.  I should also add for the non-Ford fans who are  curious...that this tells only half the story...the amazing Ford/John Wayne pictures are not here...and need to be in any Ford collection...among  others so it isn't really even definitive Ford for $300...

I guess I would just sum  it up by saying...you can get basically all of this elsewhere ..in a lot more convenient packaging and a lot cheaper...so this is something for the fan who just needs it all and or collector..but as is I can't recommend it for beginning Ford fan or fanatic.",1197331200,23,1551,4.530465949820789
2983543,4,B000WMA6HI,"I think this huge set has some missing Ford films shot at the Fox studios.
I have spotted two. The Submarine Patrol 1939 and Men Without Women 1930. They are also Fox films directed by Ford. But the set does not include them. I don't understand why. This huge set should have had all Ford-Fox films.

And I don't understand why ""The World Moves On"", ""Tobacco Road"" and ""The Four Men and a Prayer"" won't be released individually while some very early and obscure Ford films (like Just Pals) will be available separately. These films has a star power which is also a strong selling point for classic film fans. Madeleine Carroll, Gene Tierney, Loretta Young etc. I hope they will also be available in the near future.",1191888000,22,715,4.5859375
2983544,5,B000WMA6HI,"""Texan Refugee"" gives a good description of the set.  It's on my ""Christmas list."" A must for John Ford fans. I already have most of the movies already released on DVD but will get the set anyway because it would cost so much more to try and buy the other movies separately plus all the extras.",1191369600,8,294,4.25

Every one of the discs in my set had scratches due to the style of packaging. I give the films 5 stars. The quality control I give 1 star.

3218031,4,B000WMA6HI,"Even a Chinese audience like me would have known JOHN FORD as one of the greatest directors of all-time. Four-time-winning of Academy Awards for Best Director, he's created a large bundle of masterpieces in B&W film history. This Boxset contains the full works during Ford's age when working at 20th Century Fox. The reason I brought down a star is that the package style of the boxset-it can't be more protective to the disc as I expected. Besides, YOUNG MR. LINCOLN in it is only the film, without any special fatures in the former CRITERION edition, maybe due to the limit of copyrights? Who knows?
However, the service of AMAZON.com was truly acceptable. The whole boxset was brand new when I received it, which is hard to believe for a parcel that had crssed the Pacific...Hmm, but it's cost my whole month's salary. Dinner's been cancelled.",1239840000,13,846,4.801369863013699

3218034,1,B000WMA6HI,"this is a collection of great films in the most horrilbe package that could possible be designed. the box is badly sized, extremely heavy and utterly unnecessary. the way the dvd's are packaged within the box is sheer idiocy: suspended (or not) on weird, gel-like, rubber spindles that make dvd removal and replacement extremely difficult. additionally, fox was too cheap to put each film on its own dvd, and the packaging has no labeling, so one is also faced with the prospect of trying to read the miniscule printing around the spindle hole on the dvd.

overall, this idiot collection offers yet more proof that sonny bono hit that tree a few years too late.

the modern day fox company doesn't deserve to have the rights to these pictures under its control. this is particularly true as one discovers how little care fox took of the negatives and original prints, and how indebted we are to the universities and museums that preserved this stuff.

this box is an utter and complete waste of money.",1212969600,21,1001,4.741379310344827

3218037,5,B000WMA6HI,"A superb andmonumental collection of the great Irish American director's work with a single studio from silent days with the William Fox Studios to sound days with 20th Century Fox, a fruitful collaboration with Producer Darryl F. Zanuck that yielded such masterworks as THE IRON HORSE, FOUR SONS, PILGRIMAGE, STEAMBOAT AROUND THE BEND, YOUNG MR LINCOLN, GRAPES OF WRATH and MY DARLING CLEMENTINE etc... The delight is in these films and also in the lesser known works, including his WWII documentaries BATTLE OF MIDWAY, DECEMBER 7TH etc., which add to the richness of the package... Henry Fonda is the star of choice in the 1940's, and John Wayne is not to be found in any on the 24 films... Highly recommended!",1199664000,3,712,4.892561983471074
3218038,1,B000WMA6HI,"This set is impressive, no doubt. The collection of films is fantastic; the packaging looks nice, but it's all over the internet: the way the discs are secured damages them.

My set arrived-- with all of the discs on their spindles appropriately-- and EVERY ONE had significant scratches due to the method by which they were SCREWED ON to the spindles.

Were I the only person with this issue, I wouldn't score this set so poorly, but I have talked to dozens of people who purchased the set. Only ONE received his without significant scratching. I've tried contacting Fox, but they have been no help at all.",1199404800,73,607,4.663551401869159
3218039,3,B000WMA6HI,"Hi Folks,

I bought this set...even though I own most of the strongest films in the collection as any true movie or Ford fan would...they are simply classics. I'm writing to tell the curious what the extra stuff is...and frankly, its not much. The smaller sets available are much better deals for the Ford novice.  This set does  contain Tobacco Road (which I'm sure will be out on its own soon) and a few other oddities that may or may not make it on their own but the packaging is overly large to accomodate the hardback book..which is really the only true extra item in here...and while its a really nice book , I doubt anyone would like to pay 2-3 hundred bucks for it.  You can collect most of the relevant films in the smaller sets MUCH less expensively and the documentary DVD which is superb...is available on its own as well as in the classic set with Grapes/CLementine/How Green and Drums along the Mohawk...and You get cover art etc...this set is sadly lacking in such as the DVDs are in a big book.  I should also add for the non-Ford fans who are  curious...that this tells only half the story...the amazing Ford/John Wayne pictures are not here...and need to be in any Ford collection...among  others so it isn't really even definitive Ford for $300...

I guess I would just sum  it up by saying...you can get basically all of this elsewhere ..in a lot more convenient packaging and a lot cheaper...so this is something for the fan who just needs it all and or collector..but as is I can't recommend it for beginning Ford fan or fanatic.",1197331200,23,1551,4.530465949820789
3218040,4,B000WMA6HI,"I think this huge set has some missing Ford films shot at the Fox studios.
I have spotted two. The Submarine Patrol 1939 and Men Without Women 1930. They are also Fox films directed by Ford. But the set does not include them. I don't understand why. This huge set should have had all Ford-Fox films.

And I don't understand why ""The World Moves On"", ""Tobacco Road"" and ""The Four Men and a Prayer"" won't be released individually while some very early and obscure Ford films (like Just Pals) will be available separately. These films has a star power which is also a strong selling point for classic film fans. Madeleine Carroll, Gene Tierney, Loretta Young etc. I hope they will also be available in the near future.",1191888000,22,715,4.5859375

8223727,5,B000WMA6HI,"The fact that THE IRON HORSE is from 1924 should have told me it's a silent movie but I wasn't thinking. I'm not a fan of silent movies but my husband got the collection for Christmas and he wanted other films. to start at the beginning. The other movies are 'talkies.'

I can't believe how much I loved the silent movie. This was the beginning of John Ford's career, so much so that he is not credited onscreen. Even though he isn't credited, it is so clearly a John Ford film. The action, drama and humor intertwine so clearly into his style. Fans of westerns will enjoy this film and I am looking forward to watching the progression of his talent over time.

I know the other movies.  This collection is well worth the cost.",1483228800,3,727,4.37037037037037

A relatively minor note - the care expended by whoever was responsible for packing and shipping, was the very worst I have seen in all the years I've ordered from Amazon.
