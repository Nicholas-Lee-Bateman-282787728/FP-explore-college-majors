8203274,5,B000RZIGWW,"We're getting ready to move overseas and wanted some familiar shows for our 2 year old.  It gets expensive trying to buy a DVD for each show.  This is a great answer.  Lots of variety, her favorite shows, and no commercials!  Having 3 discs keeps us from seeing to many repeats too.  I choose this one instead of Vol. 1-3 because 4-6 only has one LazyTown episode.  I don't like Lazytown I think it's weird.",1231718400,2,407,4.36

8203276,5,B000RZIGWW,We bought these for our two year old before heading out on a road trip. We usually DVR his favorite shows but since we can't take our DVR with us this was the next best option. He loved seeing all his favorite shows and I loved the fact that I wasn't stuck listening to the same thing over and over!,1223164800,,299,4.0
