3121449,5,B00141188M,"I have recently come to love Elizabeth Gaskell.  She had a great sense of humor and was not afraid in the least to tackle the tough issues in her day. BBC and A&E do a fabulous job telling her stories.  I have watched all of these movies over and over, and never tire of them!",1214352000,2,276,4.0
3121450,5,B00141188M,"I loved reading the books, but the films created for North & South, Cranford, and Wives & Daughters are just wonderful.  With the exception of Cranford, the adaptations are true to the books.  The difference with Cranford was that the film was a compilation of 3 short stories. Also one sister's dislike of men was smoothed over.  Given that, however, the filmakers were still able to truly capture the characters.  I will continue to enjoy viewing these over and over.",1214092800,2,469,4.825
3121451,5,B00141188M,"I am not a Jane Austen- type person but Cranford was very entertaining, funny, touching, and, oh, yes, romantic.  The cast was superb.  I will probably look for Gaskell's books.",1213315200,,177,4.866666666666666
3121452,4,B00141188M,This is a marvelous trio displaying Elizabeth Gaskell's novels.  I couldn't be more pleased.  The quality is great and shipping was very speedy.,1213315200,2,144,5.217391304347826
3121453,5,B00141188M,"Want to escape the madness of the technological age and delight in the charm and grace of another time? These films based on Elizabeth Gaskell's novels provide a refuge back into an era when people conversed with one another with wit and good manners. Even the silliness of some of the customs of the 19th century are refreshing. If you long to, once again get a real letter--written with warmth, proper spelling and correct grammar instead of a text-message you need crib notes to decipher--then I suggest you spend an evening watching one of these excellent films. The superior acting, beautiful clothes and real romance are icing on the cake.",1212883200,2,645,4.872727272727273
3121454,3,B00141188M,"I bought this hoping to finally have a 16x9 version of Wives and Daughters.  All of the technical specs I could find listed the DVDs as being in this aspect ratio.  I was disappointed that the transfer of Wives and Daughters is exactly the same as is contained on the individual DVDs of the show. This means on my widescreen TV I get black bars around the whole picture. NOT the best for watching.

I Haven't had time to watch the other movies yet, which ARE in 16x9 as the bottom of the package indicates.  Too bad the BBC didn't give W&D the update it deserves.",1212710400,17,563,4.283018867924528
3121455,5,B00141188M,"""North & South"" alone is reason enough to buy this dvd collection. This coupled with two other period drama powerhouses ""Wives & Daughters"" and ""Cranford"" makes this a collection that any period drama/classics/romance fan should be without.  These dramas by author Elizabeth Gaskell represent the finest that BBC drama has to offer.

** ""North & South"" is the spectacular adaptation of the novel that centers on John Thornton (who represents the industrial north) and Margaret Hale (who represents the idyllic, agricultural south). Theirs is a war of words, cultures and personalities as Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby Ashe) and her family struggle to adapt to life in the dirty, noisy, mill town of Milton after a carefree, comfortable life in the southern town of Helstone. There her family meets manufacturer John Thornton (played by the unforgettable Richard Armitage) and his family and it is dislike-at-first-sight for Margaret. She finds Mr. Thornton a rough, proud and haughty man who treats his employees with disdain.  Mr. Thornton, however, is instantly smitten with the outspoken and fearless Margaret.  But as Margaret gradually learns to appreciate Mr. Thornton, events take place that threaten to divide them from each other forever.

** ""Wives and Daughters"" is the story of young Molly Gibson (Justine Waddell) and her widowed father (Bill Paterson).  Molly lives a carefree life, until her father remarries and brings home his new wife, Hyacinth (Francesca Annis). She and her lovely daughter Cynthia (Keeley Hawes) bring change and sometimes chaos to the Gibson's lives and Molly finds herself in competition with Cynthia for the affections of Roger Hamley (Anthony Howell), the son of the local squire (Michael Gambon). We soon find that all is not as it seems and long-kept secrets are unearthed which threaten the love lives and reputations of both Molly and Cynthia.

** The splendid ""Cranford"" starring a bevy of British acting greats led by Judi Dench, Michael Gambon, Eileen Atkins, Francesca Annis and Imelda Staunton.  The story centers around the locals in the sleepy town of Cranford, where everyone makes it their business to know everything about their neighbors. Their lives are turned topsy turvy when a handsome young doctor (Simon Woods) with new ideas arrives and rumors of the railroad threaten to destroy their idyllic town.  This is truly an ensemble cast, as all stories intermingle and each character makes an impact of the lives of others in the town.  Judi Dench and Eileen Atkins play the Jenkyns sisters; Lisa Dillon play their cousin Mary Smith; Deborah Findlay and Selena Griffiths play the Tomkinson sisters; Imelda Staunton is the quirky and nosy Miss Pole; Barbara Flynn is the elegant Mrs. Jamieson; Julia Sawalha is the quiet spinster Jessie Brown and Jim Carter is her outspoken father; Francesca Annis plays the haughty and aristocratic Lady Ludlow; Greg Wise plays her cousin Sir Charles Maulver; Phillip Glenister plays Lady Ludlow's land agent, Mr. Carter; and Alex Etel is a young man that Mr. Carter takes on.

What sets these apart from other costume dramas is the consistency of the acting, the high production values, the compelling stories, and memorable characters.  I dare you not to feel John Thornton's pain as he says ""Look back at me"" as he watches Margaret climb up the carriage on her way back to London, or Harry Gregson's pain as he says goodbye to a beloved mentor, or the thrill as Roger Hamley sees Molly's transformation at the Cumnor's ball.  These are wonderful stories that you will want to watch over and over, which make this dvd collection an absolute gem.",1212624000,202,3638,5.104377104377105
3121456,5,B00141188M,"I could barely put this collection down. The stories were wonderful. And, since I do not care for sexual content I was very pleased to have this series in my home. There is absolutely nothing objectionable.",1212537600,12,206,4.75
3121457,3,B00141188M,"This version of Cranford is condensed! So consider this if you're thinking of purchasing. Two hours (or more?) have been edited out from the original edition. So if you want to see the complete version, you need to order the complete series.
I don't know about the other two titles in the collection, but if you're wondering, you'd better check on those too.",1506988800,,358,4.698412698412699

The other two are typical period pieces.  North and South is a masterpiece!",1505692800,,243,4.5813953488372094
3121461,4,B00141188M,"I really enjoyed ""North & South""...it wasn't at all what I expected.  It was so much better & different than anything I've seen before.  I thought it was going to be about two main characters (or more) during the Civil War but it is not.  I won't give away any of the plot except to say that it's romantic but in a realistic kind of way (along the lines of Elizabeth Bennett & Darcy in Pride & Prejudice""). It kept my interest the entire time.  In fact, I may just watch it again; that's why I'm not donating it (for awhile at least)  I only keep the dvd's I may want to watch again. ""Wives and Daughter's was enjoyable but I know I won't watch it again.  The third movie ""Cranford"" is set in the small town called that. I enjoyed some of it but some is pretty depressing or sad b/c it's very realistic of the times and it's simply about the different lives & people who live there.  So, like any normal town & people it has it's ups & downs; good times & bad times.  The characters and the plot are very true to life (even has some graphic scenes).",1504137600,,1049,4.1330049261083746

3121464,5,B00141188M,"My husband and I love period pieces and anything Jane Austen- like.  We absolutely love this collection!  Cranford is so fun and humorous too!  Wives and Daughters is also great.  Of course with Cranford being 5 episodes and Wives and Daughters being 4 we're certainly not watching them every week, but we do look forward to them.  North and South is a tad bit different.  First, it's filmed in muted colors so if you're wondering what the deal is with the  ""look"" of the movie I guess the director thought that was fitting to some of the themes of the movie.  It's definitely more serious than the other two- you would not use the word humorous here, but it brings to light conflicts of industrialization and is a much more probing movie all the same.  Although the ending is great, I do have to say that if you have read the book I think you'll be a tad disappointed that they totally changed the ending.  The ending is satisfying, but I love the ending of the book!  'Whenever we watch the movie I insist on getting the book out and rereading the real ending to my husband!  Watch the movie, but then read the book too.",1496448000,4,1122,4.393203883495145

3121466,5,B00141188M,"I really love these, and having them all together in one collection is great!

Wives and Daughters is probably my least favorite, but it's still a good story too; I just think it takes a bit too long and goes a bit slow, comparatively.
Cranford is very charming (and there's a sequel that is NOT included in this collection, if you like Cranford).
And North and South is my favorite of the collection. It's like a more informational or historical Pride and Prejudice.
I typically end up rewatching North and South at least every other year, and Cranford a little less often than that, but I really enjoy both of them.",1494892800,,617,4.558558558558558

I could not stop watching, what a wonderful mini series! The love story between Margaret & Thornton, literally pulls the strings in your heart, their chemistry is phenomenal!

All three are enjoyable, but it's ""North and South"" that I've re-watched a couple of times already.  The ending is as romantic as you can get, and Richard Armitage is the bee's knees in leading men.  He is sexier than Colin Firth; it's that baritone voice that does it for me.  After seeing ""North and South"", I bought the book and read it immediately.  But I think this is one of those rare occasions where the DVD is better than the book.  I'd still recommend reading the book, but the ending in the book is not nearly as satisfying as the ending in the mini-series.",1463702400,8,678,4.291338582677166

Wives and Daughters is about a young woman and her widower father, and the men and women they are acquainted with.  It's also a coming of age drama about romantic attachments.  Its good.

Cranford is about a small town where unmarried women hold much of the wealth, and dictate appropriate behavior.  Things change.  Judi Dench is in it.  As is Michael Gambon.  it was also good.

I really liked North & South.  It's about a family, the Hales, who move from the pastoral south of England, to the industrial North.  It's a romance, in the vein of Pride & Prejudice, and thoroughly enjoyable.  It has Bates from Downton Abbey playing a very similar character [as he did, also, in Larks Rise to Candleford] - Brendan Coyle is the actor.  I thought I'd never seen the romantic leads; Margaret Hale & John Thornton [Daniela Denby-Ashe & Richard Armitage - actors], but Richard Armitage is in the Last Hobbit movie - battle of the five armies.

3121529,5,B00141188M,"If for no other reason than for the wonderful performances of many of the BBC's greatest actors, you'll enjoy this collection. But I suggest that you also buy ""Return to Cranford.""  The acting is great, the reproduction of the times and the manners of the age, the characters whom you will learn to love, and the great love stories. In Cranford you visit a village that has stopped in time and is finally being forced to change. In ""North and South"" you learn about the difference in life's challenges in the manufacturing North and the pastoral South. In ""Wives and Daughters,"" you see women's relationships and changing roles in an era long past. All of the series are moving and thought provoking.

3121541,5,B00141188M,"This DVD series of three stories - Cranford, North & South and Wives and Daughters is just splendid. Be taken back in time to when things were simpler and when appearances meant everything. As a weaver/knitter/spinner I am fascinated to see the authentic fabrics and knitted shawls and costumes of the time. In North & South, the weaving equipment being run in the cotton mill is a joy to see. The stories of the characters are most compelling and you will quickly become involved in the story, hoping that they will make the right decisions or that fate will be kind. In some cases it is and in others it is not. The acting is according to the times in order to keep the authenticity of the times. I have watched the series at least three times now and enjoy them as much each time I see them. The film quality is excellent, the acting superb, the costumes glorious.

The other two movies are horrible and I doubt I will even finish them. I thought all three of these stories would be passionate romances but I was dead wrong. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this collection and had only gotten North and South. This collection costs too much for such a sorry group of movies.

Wives and Daughters was so boring I only got through ten minutes of it. I will try to finish it only because I spent so much money on this collection. Cranford was confusing and silly. Once again I thought this would be a romance and I got a long, drawn out story focused on chatty, nosy old women. What was supposed to be funny wasn't and the movie had no direction. I haven't finished this one either but because of the price, I'll have to force myself to finish.

If you're looking for a quality collection, try other BBC collections and skip this one. North and South was wonderful. I loved every minute of it but the other two movies were straight garbage. I couldn't watch more than ten minutes at a time of Cranford or Wives and Daughhters without daydreaming or dozing!

These, however, are great. BBC does a fantastic job of high-quality production, and Elizabeth Gaskell's characters are much more complex than anything Austin ever wrote. It makes for a very real, very interesting drama. (If you're looking for explosions, car chases, and hot women, though, you might need to look elsewhere. And get better taste.)

I adored the portrayal of Molly Gibson, and when I read the book later, I appreciated the casting even more - if only all my favorite heroines could be cast with such perfection!  Cranford was lovely, and when I read the books it was based on, I realized what a fantastic job they had done blending the stories and characters.  It was a little hard to take, in reading, because the flow of the stories and character development in the movie was so fantastic, and it's very chopped up and spread out in the books.  North & South was a surprise because it's not a setting that I would have thought I'd enjoy for a story, but again, superb casting and adaptation was pulled off by the makers.  I saw each of these before reading the books, and these fall into the rare gem category where I enjoy each with the same depth, except for Cranford, where I actually prefer the movie version over the books.  Gaskell was an author I stumbled on when doing a search for ""If you like Jane Austen, you'll like..."" because there just aren't enough Jane Austen books.  I was not disappointed, and I don't think many Austen fans would feel differently.  I'm not sure whether I've watched these movies more times, or read the books more times, but either way, these stories are treasures.",1372550400,,1441,4.469465648854962

Of the three stories, I personally favor ""North and South"" but have no hesitation in recommending that you view all three tales because each has been produced with fidelity to the time and place with characters that are intriguing and imperfect human beings.

No need to tell you that the acting is impeccable and the casting is a stroke of genius--and by this I mean in all three tales. Elizabeth Gaskell proves that she's worthy of much more acclaim as a writer than she ever received in her lifetime.

Vividly entertainment from start to finish, each tale is told in polished fashion with great performances (leads and supporting players) in each case. It's useless to single out individuals, it's that good.

Summing up: Should appeal to any discerning viewer interested in the classics.",1310688000,,1035,4.76536312849162

I love the storyline and depth of characters in ""Wives and Daughters."" I love the woman-centered goodness and humor and fear of social change in ""Cranford."" And I love the love story and the nuanced portrayal of class differences in ""North and South."" Each of these productions boasts casts of splendid British actors building solid, sympathetic characters whom you grow to understand and really care about. Of course, they are interpreting Elizabeth Gaskell's fine writing, so kudos to Mrs. Gaskell for her creative genius!

I was particularly impressed with the cinematography in ""North and South"" -- incredibly elegant camera movements and gorgeous lighting and framing of scenes. It's not only a great story that will engage your heart, it is extraordinarily beautiful to look at -- visually stunning.

Of the other two films, I found 'Wives and Daughters' better than 'Cranford', but neither was as good as N&S, perhaps due to the larger ensemble of characters that gave less intensity to the lead storylines.

My new favorite actor is now Michael Gambon.  I can't say enough about the series and fine acting.  I ordered from Amazon today another British series.

Wives & Daughters is an intriguing look at how social norms dictate tolerance and love, despite the sometimes frustrations of others. Cranford must be seen through the eyes of one with dry wit at some of the humorousness of human behavior. North & South sweeps you into the lives of those who must continually adapt their sensibilities to acquiring a better understanding of those around them, and growing to love those they never imagined possible.

The first movie in this set i watched was Wives and Daughters because i happened to stumble upon it online. I thought it was very well done although i am no authority on the book itself since i read it only once a very long time ago. As for the film, I enjoyed it enough to want to purchase it, so that says something.

The next movie i happened upon was North and South. I don't know what it is about this film but i absolutely LOVE it! Albeit its very Pride and Prejudice like with Margret Hale favoring Eliza Bennett and Mr. Thornton favoring Mr. Darcy, it is still different enough to make it praiseworthy in its own right. I must have watched this film/tv serial at least 3 or 4 times, so I definitely had to own it. As for keeping to the novel, i have no idea since i have not yet read it.

overall an excellent buy. I get to enjoy three very well done BBC costume dramas at a greatly reduced price. Highly recommended",1282608000,,1139,4.288372093023256

3121723,5,B00141188M,"If slasher flicks, high-speed car chases, and forensic evidence make-up effects are not entertaining you, let me suggest you spend a few hours visiting the pleasant village of Cranford, England, circa mid-19th Century.  The people are mostly pleasant; the scenery is soft and lovely; the manners (usually) impeccable.  Judi Dench was my primary reason for seeking out this series.  In ""Cranford,"" Dame Judi is, as always, well worth my attention, but she has a supporting cast that deserves ample compliments.

The story is taken from a series of novels that portray the lilves and events of the women and men of a lovely bucolic English village, prior to the intrusion of the railroad or the Industrial Revolution.  The characters featured include some very poor, some quite rich, and (mostly) a cross section of the middle class of the time and place.

As usual, Dame Judi gives a charming and nuanced performance of a spinster of a certain age, living with her morally correct sister.  Sister sets the household standards, presumably to the most minute detail.  For intance, one does not consume oranges by sucking them!  At least not in the company of the other members of the household (one may retire to one's bedroom to pursue such mannerless activity, if one truly MUST, but the older sister's code is quite clear, and the consumption of oranges is only one of the items for which she has established protocol).  Sister's self-assurance validates a framework for her fellow inhabitants to pursue their lives.  One need not question whether an anticipated action is ""right"" or ""wrong.""  One knows!  And, if not, Sister will provide a ready answer on the matter.

The actresses and actors in the supporting roles bring to life the good, the bad, the gentle, and the rock-bound traditionalist landed gentry.  England may be about to change, but the residents of Cranford are not about to fling themselves into modernity willy-nilly.  The plot is not played out at lightning speed.  There are no cliff-hanging moments.  Rather, it's a lovely portrait of a lot of people whom you will probably come to like.

As was probably true for the novels upon which ""Cranford"" is based, I suspect this series (approximately 6 hours) will appeal more to women than to men.  Think of Jane Austen without the sharp edginess in the women characters.  The costumes are well done; the cinematography makes the viewer want to book a flight to England, where the scenery always seems to be bathed in a soft golden light.",1250294400,,2505,4.916666666666667

Cranford is a great almalgamation of several of Gaskell's works with fabulous actors; it's often funny and sometimes sad.  Wives and Daughters is one of my favorites; the acting is excellent.  The book was left unfinished, so the writers had to work out a proposal scene.  Apart from this oddly filmed moment, it is very satisfying.  All of the movies feature wonderful period costumes and beautiful scenery.  My only concern in purchasing the set was that one of the reviewers said the beginning commercials were impossible to fast forward through, but my skip button zoomed right through them, and if you leave the DVD in, you can pick up right where you leave off, so it was not a problem.",1247702400,,794,4.635714285714286

Swoon as Mr. Thornton (RIchard Armitage), in North and South, pines for Margaret.  If you are In a mood for humor, watch Cranford.  For a good, old-fashioned, dramatic romance, watch Wives and Daughters.  I absolutely love this collection.

The costumes and set design was wonderful; I was delightfully wisked away from reality as I watched these wonderful movies. These are slower stories and I had to watch Wives and Daughters a second time to catch everything. North and South has an industrial era setting. I don't think I'd ever seen a piece taking this setting and these challenges into the story. Wonderful acting, great story, however, it is a bit slow moving. Which is wonderful for me but some viewers might fall asleep with the pace. Judi Dench shines with the Cranford piece which is set in a small town in England. The dynamics, gossip, costumes and minds of the women of the time seem to come to light. Change is not something that they embrace. Along that same line Wives and Daughters also involves change and it's fascinating how new technology effects people differently.

I loved North and South the best merely because Richard Armitage is the handsomest, most tempting male lead since Colin Firth forever embodied Mr. Darcy. HUBBA, HUBBA, be still my heart!
Cranford was a completely surprising delight.  Every character was fully developed and the story had everything you want, engaging characters, stories, drama, pathos and lots of humor.
Wives and Daughters was not as engaging as North and South and Cranford, but it was still a great story about how a doctor marries a second wife and how it almost wrecks his great relationship with his beloved daughter, but it all turns out great in the end.

3121741,5,B00141188M,"Cranford

Cranford aka the Cranford Chronicles, based on Elizabeth Gaskell's story is a stellar production. It is a lush period drama and is very authentic in its portrayal of people living in a little hamlet called Cranford. The sets are beautiful as are the costumes, and of course the production is elevated to a level of excellence by its impeccable casting.

Writer Heidi Thomas does a wonderful job of adapting Elizabeth Gaskell's story [purportedly based on Gaskell's own hometown] and though liberties are taken, the stellar cast more than makes up for whatever deficiencies there may be in the faithfulness of the adaptation. Dame Eileen Atkins [Miss Deborah Jenkins] and Dame Judi Dench [Miss Matty Jenkins] portray two spinster sisters in 1842 who live in the little town of Cranford. Far from being a quiet little hamlet, this little town hums with activity and village gossips, especially a Miss Pole [Imelda Staunton]who flits around from one hearsay to another, avidly passing on any little nuggets of gossip to the other inhabitants.

Cranford is set aflutter by the arrival of a new doctor, Dr Harrison [Simon Woods] who is young, handsome, single and very much into trying new methods of treatment, to the initial consternation of the townspeople. Dr Harrison finds himself attracted to a beautiful local lass, Sophy [Kimberly Nixon] though he inadvertently attracts the romantic affections of other single women in Cranford.

But the story does not merely focus on romance, as there are other more serious themes underlying the series. For one, there is talk of a railroad being built that would go through Cranford, and disrupt the idyllic life in the village, giving rise to the inevitable battle between modernization and the desire for things to remain unchanged. The local rich lady, Lady Ludlow portrayed by Francesca Annis is very much opposed to change, and not only opposes the railroad but also any form of societal change, such as literacy amongst the lower classes [she refuses to hire a maid who is literate, saying the girl's parents did her a disservice by teaching her to read].

There is also the theme of lost love, death and grief. Miss Matty Jenkins[ Judi Dench] finds herself recounting the tale of her lost love [played by Michael Gambon]. This is what makes Cranford such an engaging viewing experience - the absurd [the story of the cat swallowing an anitque lace and how the lace is retrieved] is interlaced with tales of poignancy and everything unfolds leisurely. It is a tale that we wish will never end, and hope to revisit again and again.

North and South

This production of North and South stays faithful to the novel and has a superior cast - Daniela Denby Ashe plays Margaret Hale who symbolises the 'south' [rural, agricultural] whilst Richard Armitage plays John Thornton who epitomises the industrial north. When Margaret's family moves to the gritty mill town of Millstone, the two leads' paths cross and they engage in a war of words. Margaret initially dislikes the brusque John Thornton, and John in turn is attracted to Margaret's outspoken manner. Though Margaret comes to form a liking for John, both find that there may be insurmountable obstacles barring their path to happiness.

Wives and Daughters

BBC's adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's Wives and Daughters beautifully captures the nuances of family and personal relationships, amidst a Victorian setting. The writing by Andrew Davies [who also gave us Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth] is excellent as is the casting. Added to this are the gorgeous period authentic costumes, the lush landscape of the English countryside and a beautiful score.

The story centers around young Molly [played to perfection by the talented Justine Waddell] who is the daughter of local doctor Dr Gibson [Bill Patterson]. Both father and daughter are very close but the dynamics of their relationship changes with Dr Gibson's remarriage to the self-absorbed and ludicruous Hyacinth [Francesca Annis]. Molly finds herself chafing under the Victorian strictures imposed by her stepmother, and finds some relief with the arrival of her glamorous step-sister, Cynthia [Keeley Hawes]. Both Molly and Cynthia form a friendship though their personalities are polar opposites. Cynthia is vivacious and a social butterfly, and very aware of her charms and effects on the opposite sex whereas Molly is unassuming and possesses a more natural sort of beauty.

The Hamley brothers, Osborne[Tom Hollander] and Roger [Anthony Howell] add romantic interest and Molly is dismayed by Roger's infatuation with Cynthia, as she herself harbors romantic feelings for him. Meanwhile Squire Hamley [Michael Gambon] plays an ambitious man who wishes to see his sons married into the 'right' family, i.e. with proper connections and wealth. The rest of the story deals with what happens to these young people with some revelations to spice things up!

This is one of my favorite BBC period dramas and Andrew Davies' screenplay is fantastic, bringing to life the intricacies of human relationships set within a Victorian setting.

Conclusion - this DVD set is a value buy for fans of period dramas. I have worn out my older DVDs of North and South and Wives and Daughters and this set is an excellent choice to replace my worn-out discs. Also, fans of period dramas and Elizabeth Gaskell will truly delight in the superior quality of these productions, with great attention to period details, authentic and beautiful costumes, great casting, excellent score for each of the productions and the beautiful depictions of the lush English countrysde.",1232323200,23,5626,5.13551912568306

There is also a nice bio of Elizabeth Gaskell included, which was interesting.

A warning to Gaskell fans: The screenwriters are not always faithful to the stories of North and South and Cranford; the results, though, are so entertaining that it's hard to quibble.",1223856000,60,724,4.784

It is unbelievable. Since there are several episodes of the series on each disc, and you may not be able to watch the whole thing at one sitting (I don't have the time for that) it forces you to sit through fifteen minutes of drek before you can watch a few minutes of any program.  And even more unbelievable, it affects every disc in this multidisc set.  I can never get to any program.  If I could give this set zero stars I would.  The programs may be great, but I haven't been able to see them yet.  If your viewing habits consist of trying to watch a few minutes of a program -- or even one episode on a disc -- on a portable dvd player, you won't be able to use this set without spending almost as much time trapped in obnoxious commercials.",1215043200,53,1066,4.150485436893204

I had never read any of Mrs. Gaskell's books myself. Recently, I saw Cranford on PBS and decided to purchase the DVD of it.  When I saw that Amazon offered a collection of three of Mrs. Gaskell's stories, I decided to buy the whole collection.  I must say, I LOVE all three of these stories and I have come to appreciate Mrs. Gaskell as a writer, even more. If you are a Jane Austen fan, you will enjoy Cranford, Wives & Daughters and North & South by Elizabeth Gaskell, too.

With the exception of Cranford, the adaptations are true to the books.  The difference with Cranford was that the film was a compilation of 3 short stories. Also one sister's dislike of men was smoothed over.  Given that, however, the filmakers were still able to truly capture the characters.

Even the silliness of some of the customs of the 19th century are refreshing. If you long to, once again get a real letter--written with warmth, proper spelling and correct grammar instead of a text-message you need crib notes to decipher--then I suggest you spend an evening watching one of these excellent films.

This means on my widescreen TV I get black bars around the whole picture. NOT the best for watching.

3355952,5,B00141188M,"""North & South"" alone is reason enough to buy this dvd collection. This coupled with two other period drama powerhouses ""Wives & Daughters"" and ""Cranford"" makes this a collection that any period drama/classics/romance fan should be without.  These dramas by author Elizabeth Gaskell represent the finest that BBC drama has to offer.

** ""North & South"" is the spectacular adaptation of the novel that centers on John Thornton (who represents the industrial north) and Margaret Hale (who represents the idyllic, agricultural south). Theirs is a war of words, cultures and personalities as Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby Ashe) and her family struggle to adapt to life in the dirty, noisy, mill town of Milton after a carefree, comfortable life in the southern town of Helstone. There her family meets manufacturer John Thornton (played by the unforgettable Richard Armitage) and his family and it is dislike-at-first-sight for Margaret. She finds Mr. Thornton a rough, proud and haughty man who treats his employees with disdain.  Mr. Thornton, however, is instantly smitten with the outspoken and fearless Margaret.  But as Margaret gradually learns to appreciate Mr. Thornton, events take place that threaten to divide them from each other forever.

** ""Wives and Daughters"" is the story of young Molly Gibson (Justine Waddell) and her widowed father (Bill Paterson).  Molly lives a carefree life, until her father remarries and brings home his new wife, Hyacinth (Francesca Annis). She and her lovely daughter Cynthia (Keeley Hawes) bring change and sometimes chaos to the Gibson's lives and Molly finds herself in competition with Cynthia for the affections of Roger Hamley (Anthony Howell), the son of the local squire (Michael Gambon). We soon find that all is not as it seems and long-kept secrets are unearthed which threaten the love lives and reputations of both Molly and Cynthia.

** The splendid ""Cranford"" starring a bevy of British acting greats led by Judi Dench, Michael Gambon, Eileen Atkins, Francesca Annis and Imelda Staunton.  The story centers around the locals in the sleepy town of Cranford, where everyone makes it their business to know everything about their neighbors. Their lives are turned topsy turvy when a handsome young doctor (Simon Woods) with new ideas arrives and rumors of the railroad threaten to destroy their idyllic town.  This is truly an ensemble cast, as all stories intermingle and each character makes an impact of the lives of others in the town.  Judi Dench and Eileen Atkins play the Jenkyns sisters; Lisa Dillon play their cousin Mary Smith; Deborah Findlay and Selena Griffiths play the Tomkinson sisters; Imelda Staunton is the quirky and nosy Miss Pole; Barbara Flynn is the elegant Mrs. Jamieson; Julia Sawalha is the quiet spinster Jessie Brown and Jim Carter is her outspoken father; Francesca Annis plays the haughty and aristocratic Lady Ludlow; Greg Wise plays her cousin Sir Charles Maulver; Phillip Glenister plays Lady Ludlow's land agent, Mr. Carter; and Alex Etel is a young man that Mr. Carter takes on.

What sets these apart from other costume dramas is the consistency of the acting, the high production values, the compelling stories, and memorable characters.  I dare you not to feel John Thornton's pain as he says ""Look back at me"" as he watches Margaret climb up the carriage on her way back to London, or Harry Gregson's pain as he says goodbye to a beloved mentor, or the thrill as Roger Hamley sees Molly's transformation at the Cumnor's ball.  These are wonderful stories that you will want to watch over and over, which make this dvd collection an absolute gem.",1212624000,202,3638,5.104377104377105

3355958,4,B00141188M,"I really enjoyed ""North & South""...it wasn't at all what I expected.  It was so much better & different than anything I've seen before.  I thought it was going to be about two main characters (or more) during the Civil War but it is not.  I won't give away any of the plot except to say that it's romantic but in a realistic kind of way (along the lines of Elizabeth Bennett & Darcy in Pride & Prejudice""). It kept my interest the entire time.  In fact, I may just watch it again; that's why I'm not donating it (for awhile at least)  I only keep the dvd's I may want to watch again. ""Wives and Daughter's was enjoyable but I know I won't watch it again.  The third movie ""Cranford"" is set in the small town called that. I enjoyed some of it but some is pretty depressing or sad b/c it's very realistic of the times and it's simply about the different lives & people who live there.  So, like any normal town & people it has it's ups & downs; good times & bad times.  The characters and the plot are very true to life (even has some graphic scenes).",1504137600,,1049,4.1330049261083746

Wives and Daughters is also great.  Of course with Cranford being 5 episodes and Wives and Daughters being 4 we're certainly not watching them every week, but we do look forward to them.  North and South is a tad bit different.  First, it's filmed in muted colors so if you're wondering what the deal is with the  ""look"" of the movie I guess the director thought that was fitting to some of the themes of the movie.  It's definitely more serious than the other two- you would not use the word humorous here, but it brings to light conflicts of industrialization and is a much more probing movie all the same.  Although the ending is great, I do have to say that if you have read the book I think you'll be a tad disappointed that they totally changed the ending.  The ending is satisfying, but I love the ending of the book!  'Whenever we watch the movie I insist on getting the book out and rereading the real ending to my husband!

Cranford is very charming (and there's a sequel that is NOT included in this collection, if you like Cranford).

All three are enjoyable, but it's ""North and South"" that I've re-watched a couple of times already.  The ending is as romantic as you can get, and Richard Armitage is the bee's knees in leading men.  He is sexier than Colin Firth; it's that baritone voice that does it for me.  After seeing ""North and South"", I bought the book and read it immediately.  But I think this is one of those rare occasions where the DVD is better than the book.

3356013,4,B00141188M,"Three mini-series.

Wives and Daughters is about a young woman and her widower father, and the men and women they are acquainted with.  It's also a coming of age drama about romantic attachments.  Its good.

Cranford is about a small town where unmarried women hold much of the wealth, and dictate appropriate behavior.  Things change.  Judi Dench is in it.  As is Michael Gambon.  it was also good.

I really liked North & South.  It's about a family, the Hales, who move from the pastoral south of England, to the industrial North.  It's a romance, in the vein of Pride & Prejudice, and thoroughly enjoyable.  It has Bates from Downton Abbey playing a very similar character [as he did, also, in Larks Rise to Candleford] - Brendan Coyle is the actor.  I thought I'd never seen the romantic leads; Margaret Hale & John Thornton [Daniela Denby-Ashe & Richard Armitage - actors], but Richard Armitage is in the Last Hobbit movie - battle of the five armies.

The acting is great, the reproduction of the times and the manners of the age, the characters whom you will learn to love, and the great love stories. In Cranford you visit a village that has stopped in time and is finally being forced to change. In ""North and South"" you learn about the difference in life's challenges in the manufacturing North and the pastoral South. In ""Wives and Daughters,"" you see women's relationships and changing roles in an era long past. All of the series are moving and thought provoking.

Be taken back in time to when things were simpler and when appearances meant everything. As a weaver/knitter/spinner I am fascinated to see the authentic fabrics and knitted shawls and costumes of the time. In North & South, the weaving equipment being run in the cotton mill is a joy to see. The stories of the characters are most compelling and you will quickly become involved in the story, hoping that they will make the right decisions or that fate will be kind. In some cases it is and in others it is not. The acting is according to the times in order to keep the authenticity of the times. I have watched the series at least three times now and enjoy them as much each time I see them. The film quality is excellent, the acting superb, the costumes glorious.

The other two movies are horrible and I doubt I will even finish them. I thought all three of these stories would be passionate romances but I was dead wrong. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this collection and had only gotten North and South. This collection costs too much for such a sorry group of movies.

Wives and Daughters was so boring I only got through ten minutes of it. I will try to finish it only because I spent so much money on this collection. Cranford was confusing and silly. Once again I thought this would be a romance and I got a long, drawn out story focused on chatty, nosy old women. What was supposed to be funny wasn't and the movie had no direction. I haven't finished this one either but because of the price, I'll have to force myself to finish.

If you're looking for a quality collection, try other BBC collections and skip this one. North and South was wonderful. I loved every minute of it but the other two movies were straight garbage. I couldn't watch more than ten minutes at a time of Cranford or Wives and Daughhters without daydreaming or dozing!

These, however, are great. BBC does a fantastic job of high-quality production, and Elizabeth Gaskell's characters are much more complex than anything Austin ever wrote. It makes for a very real, very interesting drama. (If you're looking for explosions, car chases, and hot women, though, you might need to look elsewhere. And get better taste.)

I adored the portrayal of Molly Gibson, and when I read the book later, I appreciated the casting even more - if only all my favorite heroines could be cast with such perfection!  Cranford was lovely, and when I read the books it was based on, I realized what a fantastic job they had done blending the stories and characters.  It was a little hard to take, in reading, because the flow of the stories and character development in the movie was so fantastic, and it's very chopped up and spread out in the books.  North & South was a surprise because it's not a setting that I would have thought I'd enjoy for a story, but again, superb casting and adaptation was pulled off by the makers.  I saw each of these before reading the books, and these fall into the rare gem category where I enjoy each with the same depth, except for Cranford, where I actually prefer the movie version over the books.  Gaskell was an author I stumbled on when doing a search for ""If you like Jane Austen, you'll like..."" because there just aren't enough Jane Austen books.  I was not disappointed, and I don't think many Austen fans would feel differently.  I'm not sure whether I've watched these movies more times, or read the books more times, but either way, these stories are treasures.",1372550400,,1441,4.469465648854962

Each piece can stand on its own for quality, story and production value - together they make a wonderful collection!

Of the three stories, I personally favor ""North and South"" but have no hesitation in recommending that you view all three tales because each has been produced with fidelity to the time and place with characters that are intriguing and imperfect human beings.

No need to tell you that the acting is impeccable and the casting is a stroke of genius--and by this I mean in all three tales. Elizabeth Gaskell proves that she's worthy of much more acclaim as a writer than she ever received in her lifetime.

Vividly entertainment from start to finish, each tale is told in polished fashion with great performances (leads and supporting players) in each case. It's useless to single out individuals, it's that good.

I love the storyline and depth of characters in ""Wives and Daughters."" I love the woman-centered goodness and humor and fear of social change in ""Cranford."" And I love the love story and the nuanced portrayal of class differences in ""North and South."" Each of these productions boasts casts of splendid British actors building solid, sympathetic characters whom you grow to understand and really care about. Of course, they are interpreting Elizabeth Gaskell's fine writing, so kudos to Mrs. Gaskell for her creative genius!

I was particularly impressed with the cinematography in ""North and South"" -- incredibly elegant camera movements and gorgeous lighting and framing of scenes. It's not only a great story that will engage your heart, it is extraordinarily beautiful to look at -- visually stunning.

Of the other two films, I found 'Wives and Daughters' better than 'Cranford', but neither was as good as N&S, perhaps due to the larger ensemble of characters that gave less intensity to the lead storylines.

3356191,5,B00141188M,"The absolute best collection for the classic connoisseur! All set around the era of the 1850's, sometimes highlighting the minutia and constraint of life at the time. Wives & Daughters is an intriguing look at how social norms dictate tolerance and love, despite the sometimes frustrations of others. Cranford must be seen through the eyes of one with dry wit at some of the humorousness of human behavior. North & South sweeps you into the lives of those who must continually adapt their sensibilities to acquiring a better understanding of those around them, and growing to love those they never imagined possible. All point the viewer to the need to accept and perhaps even to love people for who they are.",1284163200,,709,4.867768595041323

I'm sorry to say that in my college British Literature classes I missed Gaskell altogether, but love the care taken with these films that drew me in completely and has continued to bring me joy as I've watched them multiple times now.",1284076800,,532,4.888888888888889

These movies are especially entertaining if you're looking for something to go alongside Jane Austen, although they are different with tones. I am in love with North and South. So complex and ironic. Cranford is funny with a superb cast. Wives and Daughters is a wonderful tale. For the price of the whole collection, it's not bad considering what would be spent individually.

3356194,5,B00141188M,"Generally speaking I am quite partial towards British costume drama and period pieces. Also, as a Jane Austen fan the works by Elizabeth Gaskell are not very far off although I definitely prefer Austen to Gaskell.

The first movie in this set i watched was Wives and Daughters because i happened to stumble upon it online. I thought it was very well done although i am no authority on the book itself since i read it only once a very long time ago. As for the film, I enjoyed it enough to want to purchase it, so that says something.

The next movie i happened upon was North and South. I don't know what it is about this film but i absolutely LOVE it! Albeit its very Pride and Prejudice like with Margret Hale favoring Eliza Bennett and Mr. Thornton favoring Mr. Darcy, it is still different enough to make it praiseworthy in its own right. I must have watched this film/tv serial at least 3 or 4 times, so I definitely had to own it. As for keeping to the novel, i have no idea since i have not yet read it.

overall an excellent buy. I get to enjoy three very well done BBC costume dramas at a greatly reduced price. Highly recommended",1282608000,,1139,4.288372093023256

3356220,5,B00141188M,"If slasher flicks, high-speed car chases, and forensic evidence make-up effects are not entertaining you, let me suggest you spend a few hours visiting the pleasant village of Cranford, England, circa mid-19th Century.  The people are mostly pleasant; the scenery is soft and lovely; the manners (usually) impeccable.  Judi Dench was my primary reason for seeking out this series.  In ""Cranford,"" Dame Judi is, as always, well worth my attention, but she has a supporting cast that deserves ample compliments.

The story is taken from a series of novels that portray the lilves and events of the women and men of a lovely bucolic English village, prior to the intrusion of the railroad or the Industrial Revolution.  The characters featured include some very poor, some quite rich, and (mostly) a cross section of the middle class of the time and place.

As usual, Dame Judi gives a charming and nuanced performance of a spinster of a certain age, living with her morally correct sister.  Sister sets the household standards, presumably to the most minute detail.  For intance, one does not consume oranges by sucking them!  At least not in the company of the other members of the household (one may retire to one's bedroom to pursue such mannerless activity, if one truly MUST, but the older sister's code is quite clear, and the consumption of oranges is only one of the items for which she has established protocol).  Sister's self-assurance validates a framework for her fellow inhabitants to pursue their lives.  One need not question whether an anticipated action is ""right"" or ""wrong.""  One knows!  And, if not, Sister will provide a ready answer on the matter.

The actresses and actors in the supporting roles bring to life the good, the bad, the gentle, and the rock-bound traditionalist landed gentry.  England may be about to change, but the residents of Cranford are not about to fling themselves into modernity willy-nilly.  The plot is not played out at lightning speed.  There are no cliff-hanging moments.  Rather, it's a lovely portrait of a lot of people whom you will probably come to like.

As was probably true for the novels upon which ""Cranford"" is based, I suspect this series (approximately 6 hours) will appeal more to women than to men.  Think of Jane Austen without the sharp edginess in the women characters.  The costumes are well done; the cinematography makes the viewer want to book a flight to England, where the scenery always seems to be bathed in a soft golden light.",1250294400,,2505,4.916666666666667

The book was left unfinished, so the writers had to work out a proposal scene.  Apart from this oddly filmed moment, it is very satisfying.  All of the movies feature wonderful period costumes and beautiful scenery.

These are slower stories and I had to watch Wives and Daughters a second time to catch everything. North and South has an industrial era setting. I don't think I'd ever seen a piece taking this setting and these challenges into the story. Wonderful acting, great story, however, it is a bit slow moving. Which is wonderful for me but some viewers might fall asleep with the pace. Judi Dench shines with the Cranford piece which is set in a small town in England. The dynamics, gossip, costumes and minds of the women of the time seem to come to light. Change is not something that they embrace. Along that same line Wives and Daughters also involves change and it's fascinating how new technology effects people differently.

I loved North and South the best merely because Richard Armitage is the handsomest, most tempting male lead since Colin Firth forever embodied Mr. Darcy. HUBBA, HUBBA, be still my heart!
Cranford was a completely surprising delight.  Every character was fully developed and the story had everything you want, engaging characters, stories, drama, pathos and lots of humor.
Wives and Daughters was not as engaging as North and South and Cranford, but it was still a great story about how a doctor marries a second wife and how it almost wrecks his great relationship with his beloved daughter, but it all turns out great in the end.

3356238,5,B00141188M,"Cranford

Cranford aka the Cranford Chronicles, based on Elizabeth Gaskell's story is a stellar production. It is a lush period drama and is very authentic in its portrayal of people living in a little hamlet called Cranford. The sets are beautiful as are the costumes, and of course the production is elevated to a level of excellence by its impeccable casting.

Writer Heidi Thomas does a wonderful job of adapting Elizabeth Gaskell's story [purportedly based on Gaskell's own hometown] and though liberties are taken, the stellar cast more than makes up for whatever deficiencies there may be in the faithfulness of the adaptation. Dame Eileen Atkins [Miss Deborah Jenkins] and Dame Judi Dench [Miss Matty Jenkins] portray two spinster sisters in 1842 who live in the little town of Cranford. Far from being a quiet little hamlet, this little town hums with activity and village gossips, especially a Miss Pole [Imelda Staunton]who flits around from one hearsay to another, avidly passing on any little nuggets of gossip to the other inhabitants.

Cranford is set aflutter by the arrival of a new doctor, Dr Harrison [Simon Woods] who is young, handsome, single and very much into trying new methods of treatment, to the initial consternation of the townspeople. Dr Harrison finds himself attracted to a beautiful local lass, Sophy [Kimberly Nixon] though he inadvertently attracts the romantic affections of other single women in Cranford.

But the story does not merely focus on romance, as there are other more serious themes underlying the series. For one, there is talk of a railroad being built that would go through Cranford, and disrupt the idyllic life in the village, giving rise to the inevitable battle between modernization and the desire for things to remain unchanged. The local rich lady, Lady Ludlow portrayed by Francesca Annis is very much opposed to change, and not only opposes the railroad but also any form of societal change, such as literacy amongst the lower classes [she refuses to hire a maid who is literate, saying the girl's parents did her a disservice by teaching her to read].

There is also the theme of lost love, death and grief. Miss Matty Jenkins[ Judi Dench] finds herself recounting the tale of her lost love [played by Michael Gambon]. This is what makes Cranford such an engaging viewing experience - the absurd [the story of the cat swallowing an anitque lace and how the lace is retrieved] is interlaced with tales of poignancy and everything unfolds leisurely. It is a tale that we wish will never end, and hope to revisit again and again.

North and South

This production of North and South stays faithful to the novel and has a superior cast - Daniela Denby Ashe plays Margaret Hale who symbolises the 'south' [rural, agricultural] whilst Richard Armitage plays John Thornton who epitomises the industrial north. When Margaret's family moves to the gritty mill town of Millstone, the two leads' paths cross and they engage in a war of words. Margaret initially dislikes the brusque John Thornton, and John in turn is attracted to Margaret's outspoken manner. Though Margaret comes to form a liking for John, both find that there may be insurmountable obstacles barring their path to happiness.

Wives and Daughters

BBC's adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's Wives and Daughters beautifully captures the nuances of family and personal relationships, amidst a Victorian setting. The writing by Andrew Davies [who also gave us Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth] is excellent as is the casting. Added to this are the gorgeous period authentic costumes, the lush landscape of the English countryside and a beautiful score.

The story centers around young Molly [played to perfection by the talented Justine Waddell] who is the daughter of local doctor Dr Gibson [Bill Patterson]. Both father and daughter are very close but the dynamics of their relationship changes with Dr Gibson's remarriage to the self-absorbed and ludicruous Hyacinth [Francesca Annis]. Molly finds herself chafing under the Victorian strictures imposed by her stepmother, and finds some relief with the arrival of her glamorous step-sister, Cynthia [Keeley Hawes]. Both Molly and Cynthia form a friendship though their personalities are polar opposites. Cynthia is vivacious and a social butterfly, and very aware of her charms and effects on the opposite sex whereas Molly is unassuming and possesses a more natural sort of beauty.

The Hamley brothers, Osborne[Tom Hollander] and Roger [Anthony Howell] add romantic interest and Molly is dismayed by Roger's infatuation with Cynthia, as she herself harbors romantic feelings for him. Meanwhile Squire Hamley [Michael Gambon] plays an ambitious man who wishes to see his sons married into the 'right' family, i.e. with proper connections and wealth. The rest of the story deals with what happens to these young people with some revelations to spice things up!

This is one of my favorite BBC period dramas and Andrew Davies' screenplay is fantastic, bringing to life the intricacies of human relationships set within a Victorian setting.

Conclusion - this DVD set is a value buy for fans of period dramas. I have worn out my older DVDs of North and South and Wives and Daughters and this set is an excellent choice to replace my worn-out discs. Also, fans of period dramas and Elizabeth Gaskell will truly delight in the superior quality of these productions, with great attention to period details, authentic and beautiful costumes, great casting, excellent score for each of the productions and the beautiful depictions of the lush English countrysde.",1232323200,23,5626,5.13551912568306

I had gotten a new big screen tv with surround sound and I enjoyed being able to step back in time.  Definitely a chick flick to be enjoyed.  I would recommend it.

I was wonderfully surprised with the high quality of Cranford and the exquisite North and South; this latter story was entirely unknown to me, but now I think I like it the best of the three, even though Wives and Daughters is hard to beat.",1227225600,,359,4.4393939393939394
3356244,5,B00141188M,"All three of these shows are so good, you'll be glad to have them on hand to watch again and again.  (And in such a compact package that saves shelf space!) North and South gets my nod as the best, but the other two are fantastic as well. Each contains several performances that are marvels of acting--Michael Gambon and Francesca Annis in Wives and Daughters; practically the whole cast of Cranford; and Richard Armitage and Sinead Cusack in North and South. There is also a nice bio of Elizabeth Gaskell included, which was interesting.

A warning to Gaskell fans: The screenwriters are not always faithful to the stories of North and South and Cranford; the results, though, are so entertaining that it's hard to quibble.",1223856000,60,724,4.784

I watched Cranford first (love it), then Wives and Daughters (love it too) and lastly North and South (superbly love it, the best period drama I've seen yet, just fell in love with Richard Armitage and Daniella Asby-Ashe) which became my most treasured movie. Cranford is comedy with very good actors, so as Wives and Daughters, while North and South is an addictive drama that will melt your heart to watch it over and over again.  A great treasure to keep.

3356249,5,B00141188M,"The Gaskell collection is three very different productions of this quiet author. She draws such beautiful pictures of distinct individuals of many situations in life crossing each others' paths in cotidienne and grand circumstances. If you loved the beautiful ""Nicholas Nickleby"" that almost no one saw and/or ""Pride and Prejudice"" we all saw, you will enjoy this interesting set of three detailed stories, elegant costuming; amusing, surprising, cinematic, sad and satisfying.",1215993600,,477,5.732394366197183
3356250,1,B00141188M,"I bought this set to view on a DVD player on vacation, but have been unable to watch it, because there is a fifteen minute commercial for BBC productions -- ironically including some of the material just purchased in this set -- that you can't forward or skip past, or hit menu to get past or avoid in any other way.  It is unbelievable. Since there are several episodes of the series on each disc, and you may not be able to watch the whole thing at one sitting (I don't have the time for that) it forces you to sit through fifteen minutes of drek before you can watch a few minutes of any program.  And even more unbelievable, it affects every disc in this multidisc set.  I can never get to any program.  If I could give this set zero stars I would.  The programs may be great, but I haven't been able to see them yet.  If your viewing habits consist of trying to watch a few minutes of a program -- or even one episode on a disc -- on a portable dvd player, you won't be able to use this set without spending almost as much time trapped in obnoxious commercials.",1215043200,53,1066,4.150485436893204
3356251,5,B00141188M,"I had heard a little about Elizabeth Gaskell before. I knew that she had written the biography of Charlotte Bronte but that is all I knew about her. I had never read any of Mrs. Gaskell's books myself. Recently, I saw Cranford on PBS and decided to purchase the DVD of it.  When I saw that Amazon offered a collection of three of Mrs. Gaskell's stories, I decided to buy the whole collection.  I must say, I LOVE all three of these stories and I have come to appreciate Mrs. Gaskell as a writer, even more. If you are a Jane Austen fan, you will enjoy Cranford, Wives & Daughters and North & South by Elizabeth Gaskell, too.

8253959,5,B00141188M,"British costume dramas are my fave rave books & films, and as one actor in these Bonus Features rightly summed up novelist Mrs. Elizabeth Gaskell, that Victorian yet modern novelist brings a feast of Jane Austen-like honest dry humorous observations on the British castes; the vividly passionate emotion & drama & romance of a half-Irish wild-moor Bronte; and the enlightened humanitarianism awareness & broad-brush epic with detail of Charles Dickens.

Though lacking the spiritual depth of Anthony Trollope but the actors comment Gaskell's characters the most realistic they've played, because of well-researched detail and characters not melodramatically exaggerated ""black and white"" stereotypical and judged, but modernly psychiatrically understandable and each in some way sympathetic.

Cranford is like other fave pre-Industrial Revolution British small towns magnifying folks memorably in ""Lark Rise to Candleford""; Trollope's ""Barchester Chronicles""; and also famous 'George' Eliot's ""Middlemarch."" Cranford is especially moving I think for mature ladies--per usual with Dame Judi Dench--and makes me shudder with gratitude not living in the unenlightened times of the horrors of mainstream medicine ignoring herbal lore.

North & South is younger romance in the dramatic setting of the fledgling grand scale and hardships of the Industrial Revolution.

Wives & Daughters actually centers around an endearingly good man pulling them all together to go round like spokes to his hub.

This set of her books is a vehicle for top parts for actors I particulary liked:

CRANFORD: the amazing lad; Francesca Annis (""Wives & Daughters""); Dame Judi Dench (""As Time Goes By"")

WIVES & DAUGHTERS: Rosamond Pike (""Pride & Prejudice""), Keely Hawes (""MI-5,"" ""The Durells in Corfu""), Tom Hollander, Anthony Howell (""Foyles War"", he's a British Gregory Peck)

NORTH & SOUTH:  Sinead Cusack,  Brendan Coyle (""Downton Abbey""). If you too like Tim Pigott-Smith, this may be one of his last, now deceased. I've never liked Anna Maxwell Martin cast way above her natural station in ""Bleak House,"" ""Death Comes To Pemberley,"" and d""South Riding"". But finally here she is perfectly and memorably cast.

The Bonus Features are well articulated and include an evocatively on-location biography of Gaskell, an independent cuckolding wife of a parson,  a mother, a feminist, a devotee of Italy, and the first penner of soap operas of the daily lives of neighbors & community she'd be pleased to see the vision of her books & life fulfilled by modern times and the modern filming style of North & South.",1525824000,,2585,5.435

8253964,5,B00141188M,"I have actually watched Wives and Daughters so many times, I thought that Netflix dumped it from streaming because I was costing them a fortune. I've also listened to the book on tape 6 times through, and it's not a short book. I LOVE this story, the language, the characters and the score. The opening to the book actually states that it is a story about nothing much. That's only true in that no famous history figures storm in and no battles are fought with fanfare. It's a quite, down to earth and touching story.
Cranford I have never finished, there was something vapid and over worked in the characters and wandering story toward the middle that exhausted me.
North and South is interesting, really something I'll have to watch again, because unlike the other adaptations of Gaskells' novels, the characters are a bit more unlikable because of their rigidness and some how they come off as distant and unfeeling. There is a lot of restraint and struggle, but it beautifully captures the violent social upheavals and uncertainty of that era.",1520035200,,1047,4.790055248618785
