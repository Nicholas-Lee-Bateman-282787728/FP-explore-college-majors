8736822,5,B016NG0V12,A great indie film that some how went under the main stream radar.  I highly recommend watching this film.,1454803200,,106,4.578947368421052
8736823,5,B016NG0V12,"I'm still feeling the effects of this powerful film hours after viewing.  Amazing acting, writing and directing.  Wow, I'm blown away by the realism and intensity, not to mention the oftentimes universal themes.  Couldn't help but feel that there was some personal ""knowing"" on the part of the creator of this film.  The lifestyle, family  dynamics, etc. were too real to have been imagined, created, or captured from other than living some part of this lifestyle.  Had to pause before finishing the last 13 minutes in order to catch my breath and remind myself to relax, it was just a movie.  Yet, despite the ending, the last few minutes lit a flame of hope in my heart that there was a possibility of a better future.  Maybe?  What hit me hard were the two very last scenes - the tribute in memoriam and Jack as a child at the beach.  Knowing a beach childhood myself, the dreams of the future were always so much a part of that location.  Powerful film done in topnotch style.",1454544000,,980,4.542857142857143
