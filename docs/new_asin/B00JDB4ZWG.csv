6355137,3,B00JDB4ZWG,"At first glance this seems very interesting release. I would like to know if this is indeed an official R1 release and, actually, what type of products TGG Direct has released in the past. TGG website (if the same as publisher of this item) shows a collage of DVD covers - the only animation was one of those multi-disc, 200 episode jobs that feature public domain titles from questionable sources.

I hope this is the real deal!",1397088000,,429,4.571428571428571
6355138,5,B00JDB4ZWG,"If this is an official stateside DVD release, then I am very much looking forward to it!!! I've been a fan of this series since I saw it on TV as a kid. I even watch it today and have introduced it to my kids. I cannot say too much on the product at this moment, but will indeed order it when it becomes available and will comment on it further. But, for now, sounds very good!!!",1397001600,,379,3.935064935064935

When it came on at 3:30 in the afternoon I used to run home from school and barley make it in time, haha, but always did. Me and the neighbor kids used to make up the P power necklace with paper in school with purple crayons and such just like Prince Planets was, and hang it around our neck and run home, then brag about who had the nicest necklace. Which of course was me lol!!! Can't wait till they produce it for the public again. I thought it was lost forever. I've always thought this was even better than Astro Boy which was GREAT too!",1447113600,5,609,4.041322314049586
8649829,5,B00JDB4ZWG,"After reading the other reviews, inquiries & complaints these are my thoughts. If TGG advertised only 47 episodes, then I would guess the elements they planned to use are not the same elements Hulu acquired from MGM. When American International Films was acquired by METRO that is how they obtain the rights to this old 1960's Japanese anime that was originally produced by TCJ and broadcast on the Tokyo Broadcast System. They sat on it for years and years and the only way you could get any PP was in the anime trading circles and graymarket sources, some of them pretty decent, some not so decent with all the copying and poor amateurish disc authoring, etc.

The elements used by Hulu were the complete 52 episodes and quite decent quality-wise (for streaming video anyway). So, perhaps TGG was wanting to get home-video licensing via MGM but hoping to use other film elements than the MGM masters (to save money)?

Maybe they backed out realizing they did not have the complete series and sales would be affected by that. I have 49 episodes of these in my collection and would like the remainder, but would have no use for an imcompleat set unless those remaining 3 would be included in such a box set. Odds would not be good for me.

5 stars for the anime, its quirky, jerky and sometimes abysmally drawn -- but the English scripts of Reuben Guberman pull it up to be quite entertaining. I do so tire of the Astroboy/ Speed Racer/ Fernandez style of dubbing and shows like Prince Planet and Amazing 3 have a crudeness and edginess that makes them near equals of the best/worse dubbing of Japanese feature film genre.",1433289600,,1622,4.644599303135888
8649830,5,B00JDB4ZWG,still waiting for the release as are the rest of my 5 million friends.,1430956800,,70,4.071428571428571
8649831,5,B00JDB4ZWG,"Even though this item is not available but still willing to buy it,off n on I will watch some of these episodes on YouTube both me n my cousin also grew up watching prince planet after school,so when I watched it on YouTube some of the background picture is dark n some of it is light but surprisingly the audio sound is great loud but great,I wish prince planet would turn this into a big screen movie just like speed racer another sixties classic.",1414281600,2,449,4.357142857142857
8649832,4,B00JDB4ZWG,"I have a funny feeling TGG may have pulled the plug on this in terms of a DVD release, but hopefully their looking to gather up the missing 5 or 6 episodes, attempt to clean them up if needed and maybe do a Blu Ray hopefully. This one is on my watch list no doubt",1410048000,2,263,3.8
8649833,3,B00JDB4ZWG,"I would love to see this. Enjoyed it as a kid and have good memories of it. Since the first release date came and went, I hope it doesn't end up being vaporware!",1408665600,2,161,3.909090909090909
8649834,1,B00JDB4ZWG,Does anyone know what happened with this box set and why it disappeared the day it was supposed to be released?,1405555200,2,111,4.333333333333333
8649835,5,B00JDB4ZWG,"No, this release will only have the 47 episodes dubbed into English, probably with the video all cleaned up (one would hope). These English-dubbed versions had been available on YouTube, but no more.

The entire 52-episode series is available on DVD in the original Japanese, from Japan. I myself came across this back in 2006, I think. A two-box set, it cost me $400. Also, it's in Japan's region format (Region 2?), so you need to play the DVDs on your PC/laptop, or a region-free DVD player.",1404259200,3,494,4.67816091954023
8649836,5,B00JDB4ZWG,"I realize I am rated this before I have seen it. I just checked my ""unofficial"" set and it is also just the 47 episodes. I am not sure what  the issue is with the 5 missing episodes. However, if the quality is as good as it is on HULU I will be very pleased. This release has really surprised me and I am very excited to see it come out.

Okay it is over 5 months after when it was supposed to be released. Excuse my insensitivity but what is up with these folks? Who goes to the trouble of advertising a release, putting it up for sale and then out of nowhere just cancels it? What could the issue be? I am tired of companies doing this. Look losers, if your not sure you have the capability or rights to release a show then don't say you will. Get your act together and stop giving people false hope. Many of us had orders for months. Am I to believe this just went bad out of nowhere right before the scheduled release?",1398729600,,922,4.032786885245901
8649837,5,B00JDB4ZWG,I counted only 47 episodes of this series. There should be 52 episodes in total. Where are the missing 5?,1397260800,4,105,4.3
