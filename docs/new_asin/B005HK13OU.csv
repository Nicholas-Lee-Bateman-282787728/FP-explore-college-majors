4702020,5,B005HK13OU,"The first time I saw sabu was in ""The Thief of Baghdad"" and I directly became curious to watch other movies starring this little actor. Later I purchased ""The Jungle Book"" and I was impressed by the story, by the effects and by sabu's acting, but the problem was in the DVD transfer which was extremely poor. Now having criterion releasing ""Jungle Book"" I guarantee that it will be highly restored just like other criterion DVDs. The coolest thing about this collection ""SABU COLLECTION"" is that it contain other two rare-movies starring sabu that are ""Elephant Boy"" and ""The Drum"".

4702025,2,B005HK13OU,"I have quite a library of Criterion DVDs and have come to expect quality transfers from this company.  There have been a couple of duds, including the very bad transfer of The Scarlet Empress.  But The Drum, one of the films in this set, is incredibly bad. It has terrible definition and colors that look like that have gone through a washing machine. Film is almost unwatchable. It looks like a third rate, public domain DVD that you can find at bargain basement prices.",1361577600,6,471,4.595238095238095
4702026,5,B005HK13OU,"I REMEMBER FROM MY CHILDHOOD MY ENJOYMENT OF THE ADVENTURES OF ""SABU"" the Indian young actor particularly IN THE SPECTACULAR FILM: ""THE JUNGLE BOOK"". FOR YEARS I TRIED TO GET A DECENT COPY OF THIS FILM AND THE 3 VERSIONS I ENDED BUYING ON DVD, EACH WAS WORSE THAN THE OTHER.  FINALLY AND THANKS TO THE CRITERION COLLECTION, I DO HAVE THAT MARVELOUS FILM IN GLORIOUS TECHNICOLOR AS I REMEMBER IT FROM SO MANY DECADES, LONGTIME AGO!.",1326067200,6,431,4.597402597402597
4702027,4,B005HK13OU,"I just wanted to add that if you are an ""old"" movie fan, the print of ""The Drum"" isn't half as bad as several reviewers make it sound. It is part of the Eclipse series, not a Criterion. Plus Roger Livesy's performance should make up for any shortcomings of the print quality.",1325376000,3,275,4.3076923076923075
4702028,2,B005HK13OU,"I have always been a fan of Sabu. I eagerly anticipated this nicely packaged collection of DVDs representing three films in which he appeared. Unfortunately, the transfers on ""Elephant Boy"" and, in particular, ""The Drum"" are sub-standard. No effort on the part of Criterion has been made to repair film tears, scratches, digital noise and improve sound on ""Elephant Boy."" ""The Drum"" is the worst of the three DVDs. No colour correction whatsoever, no framing of the 1.33:1 frame. For example, the credits in the titles are severely cropped, so that the names are incomplete.

The only saving grace in the collection is ""The Jungle Book."" But, even then, there is digital noise, colour imbalance and a noisy soundtrack, which should have been attended to, if only to improve the sound reproduction of Dr Miklos Rozsa's wonderful score.

I complained about this to Criterion's management. Given that I am a professional film maker one would have expected the courtesy of a reply. No so. Shame on you Criterion for 'flogging' sub-standard transfers on your dedicated subscribers.",1325289600,8,1076,5.107954545454546
4702029,5,B005HK13OU,"I recieved my Sabu dvds today and have just finished watching JUNGLE BOOK. I've gotta say, WOW! I hadn't seen the film in 35 years. I remembered it being a good film, But obviously I saw only a muddy, dull print of it, like we all have, because that is all that was available until now. Gods bless Criterion for bringing us a clear, brilliant print because it is one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. The colors are a revelation. The sets are just plain beautiful. And Sabu gives a stunning performance; far better than his more famous role in THE THIEF OF BAGHDAD.

  I wasn't going to go into detail here because it is late as I write, but I have to say a word about the sets. Sets and backlots and soundstages are part of what I love about classic films. I don't need the sets to be realistic and fool me into thinking that the actors are in a real place. All I need from sets is that they be well made and beautiful. In fact I like sets that are obviously sets. I enjoy the pretense and the artificiality, as long as it succeeds in creating an illusion and an atmosphere. (I especially enjoy the wrinkled backdrops of angry sky in FRANKENSTEIN, reminding us that it is all make believe.) The sets in JUNGLE BOOK are just amazing. I would love to see a breakdown of how they accomplished what they did. They do not create a real jungle but a fantasy jungle; a jungle of a child's imagining. More beautiful than any merely actual jungle could ever be, I will be freeze-framing this film for the rest of my life, just to look at that amazing scenery and try to figure out what is real tree and what is not, what is physical set and what is backdrop or painting on glass, or matte process. But for all the artificiality, they succeed in creating a jungle that you can almost smell. I really hope that Criterion's print is good enough to justify a blu-ray release sometime in the future. That would be somethin'.

  I haven't watched the other two films yet, but even if they are duds, I got my money's worth in JUNGLE BOOK.",1322956800,21,2036,4.2890625
4702030,4,B005HK13OU,"Alexander Korda has produced numerous quality films under his London Films umbrella, the highlights being ""The Private Life of Henry VIII"" (1933), his first international success, ""The Four Feathers"" (1939), probably his greatest film and one of the all-time greats, and ""Thief of Baghdad"" (1940), arguably the best fantasy film ever made.

In this Criterion Collection Eclipse Series #30 are three films starring Sabu (who was also featured in ""Thief of Baghdad""):  ""Elephant Boy"" (1936), ""The Drum"" (1938), and ""The Jungle Book"" (1942).

""Elephant Boy"" is a black-and-white semi-documentary, co-directed by Zoltan Korda and Robert (""Nanook of the North"") Flaherty, and this crisp print handsomely preserves the introduction of Sabu, the first Indian film actor to gain international fame, here but a child of twelve, and filmed in his native land (albeit in English).

""The Drum"" is the disappointment of this collection.  As a film, it is the best of the three, being a fine adventure yarn in the time of the British Raj, shot in India's northwest frontier (now the Afghanistan/Pakistan border).  However, the print looks no better than the U.S. and U.K. VHS versions that were available in the early 1990s; indeed, it is in need of restoration.  Tears in the film are evident, as are many flaws:  many images are blurred, and the colours are a bit washed out (especially in comparison to the sumptuous clarity and colour of ""The Four Feathers"" which was released the following year).  It may be that this is the best available print at present (without cleanup/restoration).

""The Jungle Book"", on the other hand, is in gorgeous condition, and its vivid hues are a far cry from the many cheapjack public domain prints that are being sold of this film.  It is a fine retelling of five tales from Kipling's classic, and by far the best print of the three films offered in this Criterion release.",1322784000,15,1897,5.009554140127388

8473177,3,B005HK13OU,The three films contained in this set of Sabu are all fascinating with the Technicolor transfer of JUNGLE BOOK being by far the best one available for this title. ELEPHANT BOY comes from worn material with the sound tending to be a bit distorted in loud parts. The film itself is Sabu's first and is a cross between being documentary of the elephant world and a dramatic film of a very young Sabu's interaction with the elephants. THE DRUM (DRUMS) is a Technicolor adventure film is likely the worst transfer ever put out on the Criterion label. I don't regret by purchase as I found a used set and I really wanter a decent copy of the 1942 JUNGLE BOOK but I would have been displeased at paying full price for the set.,1477699200,4,719,4.413533834586466

8473179,5,B005HK13OU,"This three DVD set features three out of four of Sabu's first films,his debut piece Elephant Boy(released April/37),The Drum(released April/38)and The Jungle Book(released April/42).The fourth film was done between The Drum and The Jungle Book,and that was his classic Thief of Bagdad,which is available on Criterion separately. Sabu's natural charm shines through each and every frame of these films. A poor orphan boy in real life,an elephant drivers son in fact,plucked from obscurity and made a star by director Korda. Amazing.
The Elephant Boy,starring,among others, Sabu,W.E. Holloway and Walter Hudd, has Sabu opening the picture giving a monologue and setting up the story for us. It concerns Sabu's rise from a wanna be hunter,mocked by fellow elephant drivers,to a full fledged leader in his own right. His father's elephant is picked to join a hunt for wild elephants. During that time his father is killed by a tiger. Another driver takes over the charge of Sabu's elephant but treats it cruelly and is injured by it when it goes on a rampage. Fearing that they will kill the elephant Sabu flees with it. The two inadvertently find a huge wandering herd of elephants and when the rest catch up in short course, they have what they came after and Sabu is celebrated as a master elephant driver.
The film is shot in black and white and is clear and crisp. The film isn't perfect,as it does show its age,but it is a decent print,provided by the BFI.The shooting in India is impeccable and gives the film,along with it's new little star,an air of authenticity. 4 stars.
The Drum,which stars,among others,Sabu ,Raymond Massey,Roger Livesey and Valerie Hobson, finds Sabu as the son of a local maharajah in the northwestern part of India. His bad uncle(Massey)is power hungry and wants the British gone so he can rule. He kills his brother,which leaves Sabu an orphan. However just before his death Sabu's father had signed a treaty with the British which involved mutual cooperation and protection. Sabu becomes quick friends with the local British colonel and his wife. When he gets word of an upcoming plot to massacre the British during a visit to see his uncle,Sabu tips them off. A total massacre is averted. His uncle is killed and Sabu is instilled as the rightful heir to the throne. Sabu's charm once more carries the film through. In fact if it had been done by some one else the impact would have not been nearly as powerful. This film is in colour, but does need a remastering/new print struck,as it shows its age. However despite that it is generally clear. 4 stars.
Finally we have The Jungle Book,which stars,among others,Sabu,Joseph Calleia,John Qualen and Frank Puglia. This film finds Sabu raised as a young child by wolves. One day he happens upon the same village from where he came from. While snooping around he is surrounded by the people there and his real mother,takes him in. Over time he becomes reacquainted with civilization but never really feels totally comfortable there. His heart always belongs to the jungle and its creatures. One day Sabu stumbles upon old ruins with the daughter of one of the villagers, and finds a treasure there. One piece of gold taken by the girl and discovered by the girl's father,sets off a greedy treasure hunt by three men. They find the gold but only the girl's father returns alive,with no treasure to show for his travail. Blaming Sabu he sets the forest on fire and Sabu rescues as many of the animals he can find,while saving the villagers also. In the end he decides to return to the jungle and resume his life there. An utterly charming tale told very well,this film is as good as The Thief of Bagdad. It was filmed in colour and is a print from the BFI also. It is clear and crisp,and while showing its age,it is the best looking of the three. 5 stars.
What can be said of this collection,is that it is a FAMILY oriented collection. That is it is as well suited for the older crowd as much as it is for the younger. The location shooting will amaze the adults,while all the wild animals and their antics will stir the small fry`s imaginations. The plots will please everyone. Unavailable for years,and in terrible prints,while they are not perfection the films are generally in decent condition and should please most viewers. There are no extras but informative liners notes with each disc,which is in its own slim case. It is great to see Sabu back in action once more and I hope his ineffable charm will captivate a newer generation as it did me so many,many years ago.",1450569600,,4551,4.769328263624842
8473180,5,B005HK13OU,"At last! A copy of 'The Jungle Book' which goes a very long way towards preserving the brilliant three strip Technicolor of an excellent film version of the Kipling story. 'The Drum' and 'Elephant Boy' are also included in the set, which is a fine tribute to a once very popular young actor who was lost to film making when he joined the army during the Second World War.",1433030400,2,371,4.391304347826087
8473181,5,B005HK13OU,"I bought this for ""Elephant Boy"", which is an excellent interpretation of Kipling's ""Toomai of the Elephants"".  I hadn't seen it in sixty years, but was very impressed, especially by Sabu and his mastery of the elephant.  The sequences of Sabu and Kala Nag working are the most impressive photography of elephants I've ever seen.  The story was very well-adapted, and lovingly photographed.",1430956800,4,390,5.158730158730159
8473182,5,B005HK13OU,"I have been a Kipling fan since I learned to read, and a Sabu fan from childhood.  I adore ""The Jungle Book"" and ""Black Narcissus"".  But now, I have acquired Sabu's first two films, and watched them from the perspective of an old and perhaps over-educated retired professor, I have a very different take.  ""The Elephant Boy"", which is an ideal boy's story, can offend some with the not quite well disguised homoeroticism of certain scenes, but worse,a basic plot--the capturing of wild elephants for perpetual servitude which, quite frankly, turned me off. ""The Drum"" made me sit up and stare at the screen.  Here, in glorious technicolor and Raymond Massey playing an evil Arab, I found none other than the urground for the current political situation in Irak, Iran, Syria, Afghanistan.  And even the beginnings of ISIL. ""The Jungle Book"" keeps its everlasting spell on my affections.  The restoration is just what one wishes for, the set is impeccable, and I will treasure it.",1425168000,3,978,4.8969696969696965
8473183,3,B005HK13OU,"I bought this three movie series for "" The Jungle Book "" but,  was not disappointed , the movie does not  follow Kipling's stories , it is actually  several stories , perhaps too long and complicated to squeeze into one movie . The production itself is very good , with very good quality and color , the acting is also good . The other two movies in black and white and in my opinion not as good .",1423353600,,397,4.064102564102564
