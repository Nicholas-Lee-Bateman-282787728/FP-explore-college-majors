8241983,5,B0011O9UXC,I  bought these DVD's for my granddaughter.  She first saw the show on TV and really liked it.  I did by several and they are a good influence for children.,1294185600,,156,4.133333333333334
8241984,5,B0011O9UXC,"What a shame the Horseland series was short lived. My kids love horseland they want more but they don't understand the show was cancelled a longtime ago becacuse they still want toys base of this series and there are none. From what I've found on the internet the toy that's on the auction sites is not reasonable. Overall I like the series and the message it sends out to kids about friendship ,truth and not to judge someone before you know them. So we own the whole series all four DVD's it's worth it!",1269820800,3,505,4.382978723404255
8241985,4,B0011O9UXC,"Our 4 1/2 year old is at that stage where she can handle a bit more complexity than the average video, and the Horseland series fits the bill well.  And the stories have great morales that I hear her repeating afterwards.  Try this one, and if they like it, buy the whole set; they're cheap used on Amazon.",1236816000,,306,4.258620689655173
8241986,4,B0011O9UXC,"My 3 yr old is obsessed with horses & she loves all the Horseland DVDs. They are cute stories and also usually have moral lessons included.  My 5 yr old, who doesnt' have a horse obsession, likes these shows as well.",1229126400,,216,4.2682926829268295
