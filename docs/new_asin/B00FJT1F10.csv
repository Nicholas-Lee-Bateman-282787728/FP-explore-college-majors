5993597,3,B00FJT1F10,"This is a good dvd for someone who is beginning or hasn't done bar exercise before. If you are in shape and have done bar before you should probably skip this one. There is no way this burns 500 calories for a normal person. Maybe an obese person, but not an average weight person. There is not nearly as much workout going on as in their actual classes. There is a lot of stretching which is great, but with all that stretching and not that much intense workout, the calorie burn just can't be that high. Most barre classes clock in around 300 calories. It's hard to say that this is somehow more challenging than the rest.

Also, there are a lot of exercises that are not a good idea if you have lower back problems. A lot of the exercise positions are very unnatural. (Probably not a great idea to rotate your hips back and forth while in a half bridge position) I sometimes go to their real classes and have the same issue. They don't seem to think the exercises through in terms of what is safe or which ways your body is meant to move.

Overall, I probably will keep using the dvd from time to time, but more as an addition to my workout rather than my only workout. The chair exercises are fun and the weights kicked some butt. Not a huge fan of the mat work (would be better if there was less strain on the lower back and neck).",1346803200,6,1336,4.21484375
5993598,4,B00FJT1F10,"I cannot recall where I heard about PopPhysique, seeing as they are on the complete other side of the country from me, but I found their set on Amazon through their website. Although the Vimeo workout preview doesn't show you squat, I was still intrigued after seeing some of the odd coolness on their website.. and I have to say the ""Original Butt"" cover is enticing as a goal on its own. I pondered it for about a month and finally decided to go for it. Plus, my bodyfriend also likes the cover.. no surprise there!

I sent him off to go to the gym and I tackled my first workout yesterday. Let me backtrack for a second.. I have a few other videos at home, they are OK but then II get bored and want to mute it or just not do it at all. I have been a trainer, competed in some bodybuilding shows, I am a runner and do like working out in the gym.. but after my injury last summer, I am trying to get back some lost muscle.. so comes in this video. I enjoyed the workouts, and unlike some, the outfits. The videos take me back to my 10 years of dancing, so I found it enjoyable er painful. I like all the little movements that help strengthen the connective tissue for my joints, which with my odd fitness past, are in dire need.

My only neg is, I wish I had a little better idea how long we were doing things as we were doing them. I like to have an end to focus on (like another workout video ground always does). But all in all, I am sore today in places I should be and am one step closer to owning that bum on the cover!",1344729600,3,1528,4.0230263157894735
5993599,4,B00FJT1F10,"First let me say that this is a tough workout, very challenging in a good way. I found it much harder than Tracy Anderson, who I have done for years. The queues are well explained and easy to follow, although my son did ask me to turn it down because the lady was yelling too much. She is a bit of a yell-talker, like the Sham-Wow guy.

I take Barre workout classes at the Dailey Method chain in northern california and this workout DVD is almost move-for-move the same workout. Weird. Will be in l.a. in a few weeks and will try a real class.",1342396800,3,543,4.171428571428572
5993600,5,B00FJT1F10,"I was impressed with this DVD.  I am lucky if I can workout three times a week, so I am in need of a good efficient workout.  This DVD delivers!  I usually go for the Firm, some Cathe, Jari Love, Squeeze, and Callanetics type workouts.  I liked the instructor.  She kept the workout moving right along so there was no waste of time.  This workout really works your entire body.  Some of the moves were beyond me, as I am not strong enough to hold the positions yet.  However, with continued use, I expect myself to get stronger and slimmer.  This workout will be put into my rotation.",1340841600,,584,4.333333333333333
5993601,5,B00FJT1F10,"I love, love, love this video. I should have bought all three at the discounted price. Darn. I've been doing it a couple of times a week in addition to cardio at the gym for a few weeks now and can already see the improvements. At first it was difficult to complete all of the exercises without stopping to rest, but I'm getting much better at it. And it's so worth it. The instructor is fun and friendly and gives very good information on how to do the exercises accurately. I would definitely recommend this video.",1337126400,5,516,4.385416666666667
5993602,5,B00FJT1F10,"O.K. I did  Pop Original Butt! I liked it. It is your typical Barre class really , but nice and modern feeling. It has the California style and funkiness that Bar Method does not have, it is less irritating than P57, it is more fun and not as boring as Pure Barre. The outfits in this one were fine IMO. The two backgrounders had lingerie type tops(black and red lace) with athletic pants and toeless black gripper socks (which I want) with the POP logo on the bottom. The main girl, Sam had on cute athletic pants that had sheer geometric panels on them and a athletic bra-top but with the cute ballet arm and shoulder shrug. I think they do this to show you can workout in your ""underwear"" theme. The music was good mix of techno and the moves were good. It had the basic sequence of any respectable barre class: Warm-up knee lifts, arms-pushups, tricep dips, light weights -I thought I was going to use 3lbs set for the light weights, but I switched to 2lbs dumbells. I used 3lbs for the medium weight, but probably could have used 5 lbs for those exercises-biceps focussed. Then there was barrework- thighs, seat (butt), abs (c-curve) and a little more butt (bridge) and some nice stretches with yoga references like downward dog, child's pose etc. I now would like Cardio Butt School. I may pass on Harcore for now. I would like one longer and one shorter workout. Overall this is a nice, fresh modern LA style barre routine.",1336435200,14,1430,4.5
5993603,5,B00FJT1F10,"Thank goodness for an at-home DVD that makes me want more.  I feel like this was tailor made for me and my butt! It's the exact workout I want, need and crave.",1335744000,2,159,3.96875
5993604,5,B00FJT1F10,"I can't say enough about how this workout can change your body. I think the difference between Pop Physique and other fitness DVDs is that I know I won't tire from this...The workout is so unique that it's exciting and actually fun every time I do it.  Not only that, but I can really feel my bum working out. Summer is on its way, and with this DVD I feel like I'm actually doing what I need to look amazing on the beach.",1335744000,3,422,4.0843373493975905
5993605,5,B00FJT1F10,"I have been a faithful fan of a Certain Petite Celebrity Workout Guru (""CPCWG"") for a year (on and off...I'm lazy) and didn't think it could get any better than her, but I am so glad to have found Pop Physique's DVD. Sam is an excellent teacher/leader - she motivates, encourages, and challenges you to push yourself beyond the comfort zone. And the routine, while intense, is easy to follow and diverse to keep the interest-level high.

This is a great workout to integrate into my daily (sporadic) workout routine. While CPCWG kicks my butt hard core - Pop Physique takes it to another level in ouch. The good kind of ouch. Shaky legs ouch.

I didn't think I would/could finish the hour-long routine (again, lazy) but I found myself more motivated (albeit sweaty) towards the end of the workout. Super amped to to try the other DVDs and work it into my regimen!",1334620800,5,863,4.597402597402597
5993606,5,B00FJT1F10,"I bought this DVD at the recommendation of a friend. I had an ovarian cyst and couldn't do my normal exercise routines full of running and jumping. I thought for sure I'd get bored with this kind of thing or that it would be too easy. Now I am fully better and have no desire to go back to calisthenics. This DVD is amazing! So fun and I LOVE the results. I also love that when I went to a yoga class, I was much stronger and more flexible. My body has really changed in just a few months (and some of that I wasn't exercising at all because of my surgery). I've come to actually crave doing pop physique. Wonderful.",1421798400,,616,4.099173553719008
5993607,1,B00FJT1F10,"Although some of the moves are challenging, I did not really sweat. There is no way 500 calories will be burnt during this workout.  Some other things that bothered me: The women in the back look like they are wearing lingerie; The instructor is annoying; There is a lot of focus on upper body when the subtitle is Original Butt; None of the women actually had a very feminine figure, more boxy shape, and not one of them had a shapely butt. Very annoying. I do not recommend.",1412467200,4,476,4.409090909090909
5993608,3,B00FJT1F10,"this workout is about an hour long.
the first 20 minutes focus on arms- you need 2 pairs of weights one lighter one heavier
the second 20 minutes focus on booty exercises barre style- you optionally may use a chair or hold on to. (recommended)
the third 20 minutes focuses on abs.

I didn't feel like it was challenging in the butt workout.  It was a good body workout so I gave it 3 stars.  It was challenging for me but I still think the name ""original butt"" and picture on the cover of the DVD is misleading.",1402099200,6,511,4.1938775510204085
5993609,3,B00FJT1F10,"I bought this to continue my lower body sculpt (I've done Jillian Michaels and Beach Body DVDs) and I'm not overly blown away by anything I've done here. I find it boring and mindlessly numbing to do once a week, let alone the recommended three times a week. I imagine that if you can get through the tediousness of the workout then you might get okay results. Also, there is no way you burn 500 calories doing this. Maybe a max of 150.

My real gripe is that the woman does does the workout and gives instructions has got to be one of the most annoying fitness ""coaches"" I've ever had to listen to. Awful voice and a total California Hipster with a false cheery ""you can do it!"" attitude. They seriously work out in what looks like lingerie and a shoulder shrug? She spends most of her time assuring you that you're almost done when you're usually nowhere near completed with working out (seriously, at least a dozen times in the DVD you'll hear her say ""this is the end"" or ""we're almost done"" it gets old.. FAST) so you have no idea where you are in the reps, I've done the DVD many times and I still put my foot or arms down only to have her move onto a slightly different exercise but still working the same muscle. Maddening. The instructions aren't always clear and her words of ""encouragement"" are grating to the ears. I don't even rate things on Amazon but I felt the need to let everyone else know that if you hate certain coaches this woman is going to get on your nerves.

Pick up a kettle bell instead - better results in a faster time frame.",1400716800,2,1555,4.303754266211604
5993610,5,B00FJT1F10,"This workout targets arms, legs, butt and abs.  I like that it has a little of everything.  My legs and arms were burning!  I have very weak arms, so the 2 and 3 pound weights they used were enough for me, but you could swap them out for heavier ones to create a more intense workout. A chair and a mat are the only other things you need.  Sam walks you through each move and tells exactly how to position your body.  It helps that she reminds you throughout the workout how you should be positioned. It's easy to forget when you are concentrating on learning the moves. The ab workout was different.  I liked it, but I felt it really only target the lower abs.  Pop Physique's Cardio Butt School seemed to work out the upper abs a bit better, but that is just my opinion.",1399334400,,772,4.210884353741497
5993611,2,B00FJT1F10,"I did the full hour of the video and didn't even break a sweat. If you're looking for a real calorie-burner, this is not the workout for you.",1397001600,4,141,4.071428571428571
5993612,4,B00FJT1F10,This is the first ever workout DVD I have purchased and I was not disappointed.  I hurt in places I didn't know could hurt the next day... and I couldn't wait to do it again.  The length of the workout was just right and it was very easy to grasp onto the sets.  I can't wait to try the other DVDs.,1387152000,3,298,3.8524590163934427
5993613,5,B00FJT1F10,"I felt like I was in a live Pop Physique Class.  Well done. If you are looking for an exercise program at home, this one works well.",1359331200,3,132,3.888888888888889
5993614,3,B00FJT1F10,"This was my first ever barre DVD and I have to say that it's just okay. There's no real instruction or variation to this DVD. I don't like the instructor. She's yelling at her maximum level and she's not very pleasant to listen to. She's using so much effort yelling that she turns red and she's out of breath and she never fully does any of the moves. The whole DVD is pretty tacky. The only reason I even felt anything is because I watched other barre videos and I knew what to expect. Other than that, it's not a very good DVD. I didn't really work out my legs that much at all. Save your money. There are better DVDs out there.",1355356800,6,631,4.138211382113822
5993615,2,B00FJT1F10,"I have been doing barre workouts for about two years now including P57, Purre Barre, Tracey Mallet, and others. The intensity of this DVD is nothing in comparison to the workouts I just mentioned.

I like variation of some of the moves (the chair work was somewhat different from what I'm used to) but the mat work was horrible. Not enough support for the low back and no variations on moves. I felt like I had wasted the last 20 min or so of the workout doing useless moves for my core.

I do like the emphasis on posture and form, however, as this is where many barre workouts are lacking. Sam gives great instruction and isn't (too) annoying. In sum,  it will be added to my rotation but could never be my primary workout.",1351814400,11,725,4.355555555555555
8616114,5,B00FJT1F10,"Amazing workout. I used to go to Pop Physique classes every day, now I do the DVDs instead. Highly recommend for toning and flexibility, and for defining abs.",1524182400,,158,4.678571428571429
8616115,5,B00FJT1F10,"I never write reviews!! This workout WILL CHANGE YOUR SHAPE FAST!!  It's not super cardio, but cardio isn't everything.  YOUR MUSCLES WILL BE TREMBLING.
I personally don't care what the instructor or anyone one else is wearing, I will say that having done ballet as a teen her outfit looked normal to me..... I seen a lot of reviews after her outfit. I love her constant reminders about position and posture because those matter and add up to the awesome body changing leg shaking changes. I have been doing this view for about 2 months like twice a week, I am still not able to do it CORRECTLY with good position without having to rest for at least a few secs. Plus I don't think I could do it more than that because YOU WILL BE SORE for days after, BUT I LOVE IT.

8616119,5,B00FJT1F10,"Excellent workout! In fact, it is my second favorite workout dvd in my collection (#1 is Core Fusion Body Sculpt). I usually prefer shorter workouts, but can go longer when the cueing is as excellent as Sam's and the exercises are simple and effective. I was definitely shaking and have no trouble believing that a full effort will burn 500 calories. This is a complete body workout--arms, legs and butt, and abs. It is in the style of Lotte Berk, Pilates, and barre, so no jumping, dancing, or compound movements. You only need a chair (I use a walker) and some hand weights. I do wish the menu would let you jump to the different parts of the workout but oh well. Still a favorite workout of mine.",1451088000,4,699,4.46875
