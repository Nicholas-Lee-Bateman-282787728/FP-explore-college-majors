1742343,5,B00006CXI3,"After viewing this outstanding concert on HBO (at least 10 times) I've come to the conclusion that this DVD is a MUST HAVE for all Janet fans.  She is incredible, as usual, but mixing the All For You songs into her rich history of hits makes this an electrifying and fun to watch DVD.  The Would You Mind compilation is a wonderful bonus and the DVD is incredibly user friendly.  Highlights include Missy Elliot's wonderful ( but all too brief ) appearance and the undeniably killer Trust A Try costume/choreography (my personal favorite).  A great addition to anyone's DVD collection.",1027555200,2,585,4.82
1742344,5,B00006CXI3,"The first thing that stuck out to me about this dvd is that it comes with many special features, something not very many music dvd's have.  The concert is wonderful, but for the fans [who no doubt taped their own copies of the hbo broadcast] the special features is what will sell the dvd.  The behind the scenes documentary, the quick-change options, and the real winner here, the would you mind collection, are the things that we've been dieing to get our hands on for sometime.  Thanks goodness someone got the good sense to put some special features on these damn things!  Praise to Eaglerock & Warner Bros.!",1027036800,3,612,4.638888888888889
1742345,2,B00006CXI3,"Yesterday I have bought the European edition of this dvd. Thumbs up for the inviting cover picture and artwork that lured me into buying it. And I was curious if this show would have a totally different concept to it compared to the Janet-Tour or The Velvet Rope-Tour... No, it has not. Only adding some of the tracks from the All For You album. Yes, it's flashy, yes it's big scale, yes Hawaii has added some individual flavor, yes J works her cute behind off. But... most of the time she's lip-synching and not singing live and when she does it sounds strained. The choreographies for songs like If, Rhythm Nation et cetera have not or only slightly been changed compared to previous tours. The stage design is best for Come On Get Up and If. The introduction part of the dvd featuring J running semi naked through the jungle is cute.
Why does she conceptually repeat herself so often? Are there no more angles to her songs and work than those she's been presenting for each of them from the start? There will come a day when her big lovely smile won't be able to distract from the fact that she seems to have run out of ideas and vision. Hate to see that day because from the times of Control she's been one of my favorites! Go Miss Janet, get a grip again!
...ok this is more a review of the show than of the dvd but I am no tech-geek who will labour hours on the technical features of a data medium... only this: European edition features a photo gallery and that Would You Mind stunt from various cities with different ""victims"" and a set of Janet postcards along with a glossy Janet flyer...it's ALL FOR YOU...",1026950400,5,1617,4.3933333333333335

1742449,3,B00006CXI3,I gave this rating an OK.....averaging out the 5 star music and the 1 I would have given it for  the explicit nature of the video.  Janet is AMAZING and surely didn't need this type of exposure!  I bought the video for my 10 year old daughter who LOVES Janet and Michael.  She can't get enough of their talent!!! I am SO GLAD I viewed it before playing it for her!!! YIKES....that would have led to WAY too many questions she is too young to address!  Its fine if you like this sort of video. Again.....Janet is AMAZING without it!!!,1397347200,,533,4.29

1742452,4,B00006CXI3,"I was bartending at a gay dance club when this aired on HBO.  For whatever reason we got selected by HBO as one of the bars that got to air it for free and they loaded us up with Janet merchandise for our staff and to give away.  It was a really fun night.  I do wonder how this looks now played on a Blu Ray player and on our new smart TV.  I have one issue with the description of this.  They person says Janet raises the bar by showing back stage footage.  Um, have you ever seen Madonna's Truth or Dare?  It's more back stage footage than on stage.  Janet didn't raise a bar with that.  Janet raises the bar in many other ways, but not that one.  And when you get down to it, Madonna set the precedence for how pop starts tour.  Long before many of these pop stars were putting together elaborate sets and gaggles of dancers, Madonna toured with The Virgin Tour and Who's That Girl.  Basically her Blond Ambition Tour not only raised the bar, but set it really high.  Then the Girlie Show took it to an even higher level recreating her songs like old movie musical numbers.  I've seen a lot of tours by pop stars live and on DVD and you can see SO much of Madonna's influence.  I'm not trying to take anything away from Janet, because these days I'm a bigger fan of her than I am Madonna, but give credit where credit is due.  Now Janet put out a GOOD album and get back out on the road.",1388102400,,1391,4.077490774907749
1742453,5,B00006CXI3,"Love Janet Jackson in everything she does. This takes the cake because she has grown up to an adult and she is doing her thing. Wish I had a DVD of her very first concert ""Control"". I'll pay big money for that.",1380672000,,210,4.023809523809524

1742483,4,B00006CXI3,"This dvd as most, if not all of Janet's concerts was a tease.....especially in the beginning....then there was the changing in the dressing room scenes...which was a bit distracting for me....in the sense that I was no longer interested in Janet's music...at least for a while.

Been wanting it for YEARS, and finally got it so I could delete the files on my computer taking up TOO much room.  This is my favorite Janet concert and I'm very happy to have a solid copy in my possession.  Shipped earlier than estimated and no problems.  Would shop with merchant again.",1358726400,2,437,4.4125

1742490,5,B00006CXI3,The Disc is in very excenlent condition even as buying in used. no scratches which is good. I went to this concert in hawaii and it was just as great as the dvd.

1742502,5,B00006CXI3,"I like the costumes and stage more on All For You. I like how the stage was more roomier. I think the lap dance was even more crazier than the last one. This time Janet was all over this guy more than the other one. Her body and eyes looked gorgeous during the costume changes. Some people prefer the Velvet Rope over this one. One reviewer said the audience overshined her. It's the other way around. I could barely hear them singing her songs. I honestly can't make up my mind concerning these two tours. All I know it's the same freaky Janet behind them, lol. If you love Janet alot like me, then add this to your collection.",1339372800,,628,4.285714285714286
1742503,5,B00006CXI3,"Janet Jackson is so sexy. I cannot stop staring at the front cover of the DVD. I also loved the back cover and everything else that comes with the item. I love the concert. I cannot wait to see this again.

If you are fanatic, attracted, or curious about Janet Jackson, please purchase this DVD.",1278288000,,295,4.363636363636363
1742504,2,B00006CXI3,"Compared to her fantastic previous tours, this one just didn't cut it.  It's a shame her Rhythm Nation and Janet tours were never recorded for distribution, as those performances, along with The Velvet Rope tour, showed what a fantastically seasoned performer Janet can be.  This one seemed a bit too rehearsed.  And she was struggling to hit notes like never before, which was nothing short of embarrassing.  She didn't really interact much with the audience, either.  For the third consecutive tour, she pulls a guy out from the audience and gropes him.  Is that talent or just skankiness?  I guess it's up to the viewer.

The backstage dressing room interludes were so contrived, rehearsed and pre-taped, it was an insult to the viewer.  In the last minute of the ""Rhythm Nation"" song performance, she takes her sunglasses off and throws them into the crowd, but then she and her dancers walk backstage and...OOPS!...her sunglasses magically re-appear on her head! BUSTED!  And those dressing room scenes weren't filmed to give us a peek into backstage events...they were so obviously choreographed to give Janet another opportunity to sell her body.

The ""All For You"" tour was the beginning of Janet's decline into nothing but sex, songs about sex, videos about how sexy she is...blah blah blah.  She's lost the competitive hunger that made her so great and this performance proved it.",1182729600,2,1390,5.021834061135372
1742505,3,B00006CXI3,"Janet is a Jackson and so her ""good"" performance would qualify as someone else's ""great.""  Perhaps it's because it was the last show of the tour, but it feels overly rehearsed and uninspiring.  If you've ever seen Michael in concert, you'd see the difference.  Michael gives you his all.  Janet does a good job, but it's not like she's giving you her all.",1136851200,,355,4.587301587301587
1742506,5,B00006CXI3,"Beyonce? britney? JLo? Please! None of these woman have anything on Miss Janet ""if ya nasty"" Jackson. Janet is, in my opinion, the greatest female performer of all time. Her dancing & performance skills are top notch, her voice is so pretty & all of these youngin performer's now are just re-enacting what they've seen Janet do for years. Here, she does not dissapoint with a show so spectacular, it looks like a Las Vegas production. A definite keeper! All the great songs, many new ones & Janet looks gorgeous, with a body that's worthy of envy!",1130284800,16,547,4.649484536082475

1742508,5,B00006CXI3,"I own this DVD and I have to say that it's amazing. The full concert is great, but it's quite a little porn and sexual, watch the intro video, when se runs to the water, you can see all of her breast, and I think the special feature where are 5 performances of Would You Mind is very hot! when you see how she performs that song, you'll believe me!

It is a great DVD, and it has 26 live performances! I don't know how does it last only 1hr 54min.

The best performances in the concert are:

-Trust A Try

-You Ain't Right

-Son Of A Gun (Missy Elliott sings it with her)

-That's The Way Love Goes

-If

-Would You Mind (oh, my God!)

-Doesn't Really Matter

-Together Again

-Rythm Nation

There are also outtakes in the middle of the concert, when a songs finishes, the camera records Janet changing her clothes.

It's very exciting, but you'll love it!",1099267200,13,856,4.24223602484472
1742509,4,B00006CXI3,"I saw her on this ALL FOR YOU tour and it was quite a spectacle. I could've done without the six or so costume changes and smoke, but I've got to admit Janet knows how to work a stage. I also could've done without the beginning where she is running topless through the jungle, etc. I miss the Janet I grew up admiring, back when it was more about her voice and lyrics than it was about her body. However, worth it for the ""Would You Mind"" extravaganza where she...well, nevermind. I guess you'll have to see it and find out! BOTTOM LINE: NEEDS MORE SONG, LESS SHOW...BUT THE SHOW IS QUITE ENTERTAINING, SO U BE THE JUDGE. A MUST-SEE FOR JANET FANATICS. GRADE: B",1091145600,4,661,4.296

Can't wait till her next tour. Love you Janet!",1090281600,3,349,4.555555555555555
1742539,2,B00006CXI3,"Janet, come on. Growing up with your genius brother Michael, you should have learned how to put on a concert. Remember you going backstage in his 1988 Bad Tour in Japan. You and your mom were right there. Remember how he moved an audience. I haven't seen that in your concerts. The audience is just standing there. In Michael's they are fainting, crying, jumping, moving, hands up, waving arms, and going crazy. He puts on an electrifying performance and he makes it look so natural. You on the other hand at this stage make is look so forced and so rehearsed.
I know you are no where near the talents of Michael Jackson, but you sure put on a good concert for the Velvet Rope and also put on a good concert I attended during your Rythym Nation tour. Come on Janet, lets be together again.
I have your concert taped, but I have all of Michael Jackson's concerts as well.",1089504000,,870,4.409937888198757

1742541,5,B00006CXI3,"I love every minute of the show, the old songs brought back memories and the new songs were just as great.  There are couple additives on the cd such as an interview with the lovely Miss Jackson, photos and ""Would Mine"" moments where you know guys got a rare threat of having their fantasy come true for couple minutes on stage with Janet.  Janet songs were awesome and can't wait for the ""Damito Jo"" tour.  She has never dissapointed her ""true"" fans and she will always have one in me.  Get the new album and support my girl Janet, cause she is the only one left in the bunch of 80' 90' diva(Whitney???--still love her, Mariah--a voice to behold, Anita Baker--A diva that never GOT that DUE recognition she deserves)  So, that sums it up, get Damita Jo and screw the FCC.  BUYYYYYY ITTTT",1079827200,2,788,4.4375

1742543,2,B00006CXI3,"This could be a 5 star exercise video but as for music it is 2 stars. I was thinking that maybe Janet would be in the same league as Madonna, Britney, Cher, Kylie, Christina... and found this dvd to have good costumes, sets, etc but the music and singing was not at all in the same league as those mentioned.

1742544,4,B00006CXI3,"Janet Jackson's All For You tour live from Hawaii DVD is a really interesting look at the tour as well as what goes on backstage. As always, you will be amazed by the stage show and how Janet can manage to perform all of those songs! Each song is it's own special show and Janet performs them with grace and ease.
This is a really good concert for any fan of Janet, and would make an interesting viewing experience for someone who has never been to one of her live shows! Check it out!",1050969600,2,485,4.170212765957447
1742545,1,B00006CXI3,"janet jackson is one hell of an overrated performer,and if it weren't for her contacts, and her family, we all know she'd never be heard of!!!WHY???BECAUSE JANET CANNOT SING, AND HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NEW GOIN' FOR HER AS AN ENTERTAINER!!!!Now, one can tell that Janet can't really sing from her studio recording, but it doesn't matter because they are well-produced, and she sounds sweet and pleasant. But trust me, that is not so in her live performances!!!!I saw this one day when it was airing on HBO, and I just sat there with my mouth opened wide in embarassment for Janet. Throughout the whole concert I barely heard, and did not understand ONE SINGLE WORD SHE WAS FREAKIN SAYIN!!!I mean, if you sound so awful live, then why go out with it???It gets me wondering how freakin' biased all these people are who give this show such high rating!!!You really gotta be deaf to not know what I'm talkin' about. Her band and backup werre also so bland, and added NOTHING to the concert whatsoever. As for the show, it doesn't matter how many fireworks,dancers, or pizzaz she throws in there, if it's not done with taste then it looks cheap!!!Well, that is just the case!!!Jant copies a bazillion moves from her bro', while desperately trying to be Madonna. She fails both, and creates a neither captivating, nor original show. I don't understand how anyone can like this.",1050624000,2,1371,4.764705882352941
1742546,4,B00006CXI3,"I'm very happy to have seen her in concert and to now see her in Hawaii doing it again was great! The best feature of this DVD is the ""Would You Mind"" block.  It's funny to see her expression from these guys who do everything to keep their composure or go wild while they're strapped in.  The pictures are from the tour book, still the shots are awesome.  I enjoyed this concert a lot.  Everything from the songs, behind the scenes, Carly and Missy, even the breakdown in ""Doesn't Really Matter"" after she introduces everyone.  As with another reviewer, I miss Tina Landon.  Shaunette, Eddie, and Gil did good jobs, but Tina and her style of choreograpy wasn't there.  I guess it's all about moving on and trying different things.  Hey, there's nothing wrong with that.  Cheers",1050192000,5,777,4.613138686131387
1742557,5,B00006CXI3,"It's not better than ""The Velvet Rope"" tour.  Buy that one first if you want to see the best Janet has to offer on Tour.  This one was more laid back and personable.  You got to see more of Janet--the lady, and less Janet--high powered performer.  I would have loved to see choreography for ""Someone to Call My Lover"", and ""Love Will Never Do (Without You)"", and others, but it's still great.  Finally, (yes I'm gonna say it), Tina Landon is sorley missed here.  Shawnette Heard and Gil are good choreographers, but Tina's the best.  Her and Janet made magic together.",1049673600,2,568,4.564356435643564
1742558,4,B00006CXI3,"Janet Jackson gives audiences an electrifying performance as she brings an end to her ""All For You"" tour in Honolulu, Hawaii. Jackson, 37, sings 26 hit songs. Some of which are from her current and four previous albums: Control, Rhythm Nation, Janet, and Valvet Rope. In her ""All For You"" tour, Jackson's fifth album includes songs like: All For You, You Ain't Right, Someone To Call My Lover, Trust A Try, and more. There is one song in this high caliber celebrity performance, ""Would You Mind,"" is where Jackson selects a member from the audience to go up on stage with her. This is as close anybody can get to Jackson, and there is a part where the fan (a male) is straped to a table as Jackson performs her musically seductive role that will make you hot under the collar! Are you ready for Janet Jackson? If you are, this is the DVD you have been looking for.",1043366400,4,864,4.440251572327044
1742559,5,B00006CXI3,"My girl Janet is in her mid-30's now, but you'd never know it by the amazing amount of energy she expends throughout this live concert. First, let me say I've been a huge fan ever since she released the ""Control"" album many moons ago (1986, wasn't it?), and one of the things that has made me such a huge fan for this many years has been her dancing as well as her unfailingly catchy music.  The ""Rhythm Nation 1814"" album has never been topped, as it contained her best music as well as her best video choreography/dancing ... and much to my delight, much of the original choreography is preserved in the live version of ""Rhythm Nation"" in this show.  Both the song and the dancing still send chills down my spine, and the message of the song clearly still means a lot to Janet.  It was also a thrill to see what I consider the best song/video/you name it/ that Janet's ever made, ""Alright"", still being given the full treatment with 40's-style yet funkily updated costumes like in the video --  all that's missing is Cab Calloway!  As always, her joyously energetic ""Black Cat"" had me up out of my chair dancing (this was only 1/2 hour after eating a huge Christmas dinner, mind you).  Fortunately for those of us who have been Janet fans since the early days, she still gives us our fix of ""Nasty"" and a medley of the older hits as well as the newer gems like ""All For You"".  I don't know how she was able to do the intricate choreography of ""If"" and ""Rhythm Nation"" so late into the show, as the entire thing involved so much energy and different choreography, she should rightfully have been exhausted by that time. This is an amazing DVD showing an amazing live performance by an amazing woman.  The extras (interview, photo gallery, etc.) are just icing on the cake.  Janet fans need to own this DVD.  And if you're not a fan, buy it anyway.  I guarantee you'll be a convert.  That young whippersnapper Britney has nothin' on Miss Janet.",1040774400,3,1944,4.46045197740113
1742560,5,B00006CXI3,"I saw the live show in person prior to Hawaii, in Hampton, VA.  I was blown away.  This women is amazing.  The energy, the dancing, the energy.  LOTS of energy.  Nothing but the real thing will compare, but if you missed that then this is a must have.",1038873600,2,251,4.145833333333333
1742561,5,B00006CXI3,Awesome concert DVD. Janet's professionalism onstage is at an all-time high. Its amazing to see Janet so focused and in control while giving us everything she's got. The Would You Mind compilation is worth the price of the DVD alone. Its a must-have for Janet fans. I can't wait to see what she's gonna do next,1038268800,2,310,4.553571428571429
1742562,5,B00006CXI3,"Janet Jackson has always been one of my all-time favourite female artists. Her style, persona and songs have always struck a chord with me like no other singer (except maybe Britney). Throughout 2001 there were some absolutely stunning tours - from Britney's Dream Within A Dream Tour (Live From Las Vegas), to 'NSync's Popodyssey and through onto Madonna's Drowned World Tour (without a doubt the most popular tour of the year). Janet Jackson's All For You was also another tour to add to this list of superb 2001 concerts. HBO reserved the rights to broadcast the concert in full in Febraury 2002, and ratings went through the roof. This performance is Live In Hawaii from Hawaii (duh!) where Janet performs to 40,000 adoring fans in an open-air arena.
The concert opens with Janet running topless across the sands of Hawaii and under a tropical waterfall. We then see the words ""Janet Jackson - All For You"" appear in gold on the screen before Janet appears on a huge podium in the centre of the stage. She wiggles those sexy hips to the superb Far Eastern beat of Come On Get Up before singing, dancing, grooving and bouncing her way through two awesome performances of You Ain't Right and All For You. The first three tracks are all from her latest superb album, All For You. Ms Jackson then goes back in the time machine to the superb, classic and undeniably unforgettable Love Will Never Do (Without You) - one of my all-time fave Janet songs! She then struts her stuff through the electrifying Trust A Try, the superb rock anthem from All For You. The costumes are awesome and the dance routines are mind-blowingly speedy! Janet then slows things down for the performances of the superb ballads Come Back To Me and Let's Wait Awhile. The former is my all-time favourite Janet ballad while the latter is an absolute Janet classic! The audience is entranced by the goddess that is Janet Jackson as she moves slowly to the smoochy ballads. They're soon up and grooving as Janet belts out five classics from the 80's and 90's in the form of Again, Runaway, Miss You Much, When I Think Of You and Escapade. As usual there's all the superb and epic stage sets to please her loyal fans and the superbly choreographed dance moves. Janet then moves onto a high energy and sexually charged performance of Son Of A Gun (I Betcha Think This Song Is About You) with a special-guest appearance by Missy Elliott. The audience is desperate for more, but has already had enough entertainment to last them their entire lives...and Janet's only halfway through!
All For You continues in spectacular fashion with the brilliant performance to Got 'Til It's Gone. After this Janet belts out probably her most popular hit in the US ever - That's The Way Love Goes. No. 1 for a whopping 10 weeks in 1993, it's now an international anthem. Janet knows this and sings her heart out and really gets the audience going by letting them fill in the gaps for bits she purposely leaves out. Up next is a trip down memory lane with a superb melody of What Have You Done For Me Lately, Control and Nasty from her legendary 1986 album Control. ""Now control THIS!"" screams Janet before breaking out into an eye-popping dance routine - one of many in the whole show. Alright is up next, the superb and incredibly funky single from 1989's Rhythm Nation. Janet only gets more sexier with her risque performance of Would You Mind - taken from the All For You album and definitely the rudest song of Janet's entire career! A lucky man is picked from the audience as Janet sings this highly erotic song to him - he seems to be enjoying himself! After this Janet funks thinks up and performs three massive and heavy tracks - If, Black Cat and Rhythm Nation. I had never heard If until this concert, but can now say it's one of the best and catchiest Janet songs ever! Black Cat just simply swings with adrenaline with its heavy guitar riffs and fast-paced dance moves. Rhythm Nation, however, has to be the best performance of the whole evening; Janet enters dressed in a slinky black leather outfit with a mysterious mask covering her eyes. She belts the song out and dances her butt off with her legion of dancers as the huge screen behind her changes colours to purples and reds to complement the night sky of Hawaii. Doesn't Really Matter and Someone To Call My Lover are up next, followed by the superb and upbeat finale in the form of Together Again. The colours on the stage are superb and the fireworks that are set off from the top of the arena makes the whole thing look absolutely stunning, not to mention massive as a helicopter shot shows just exactly how many people are packing the arena.
OVERALL GRADE: 10/10
As well as this superb concert, secret cameras film Janet changing from each costume in-between songs at a speedy rate - which is bound to raise the pulses of many a male fan! Janet belts out a total of 26 classic songs - more than twice the amount of what Britney sang on her Dream Within A Dream Tour. What's more, Janet does NOT mime in this concert - you can tell because she's always out of breath towards the end of the song. There are not many artists who can do all this while dancing at a literally supersonic speed! All For You is one of the most creative and imaginative concert tours of 2001 and to miss out would be a great shame. Buy it now from Amazon!",1037145600,9,5357,4.552331606217616
1742563,5,B00006CXI3,"I was one of very few Euro fans who got to see Janet's All For You Tour in the States last October, after Janet cancelled shows following the events of 9/11. Was it worth a long trek from Belfast to Fort Lauderdale? Here's the evidence. Ms Jackson, the most consistently electric & diverse performer of the last 2 decades delivers an even more stunning and euphoric musical odyssey than 1998's truly superb Velvet Rope Tour (which I saw in London). Set on the final night of the tour in Hawaii, this show romps through a collection of janet's hits from Control up to All For You, with plenty of surprises along the way. Starting out with 3 more edgy dance-cuts from All For You, Janet & her entourage of streetwise dancers prance their way through some hot moves, my personal fave being You Ain't Right, but also with a dazzling entry on stage & a tight breakdown to All For You. Love Will Never Do, perhaps Janet's greatest single is as timeless as ever, as Miss Janet shares the stage with her fans. Chilling. My fave track off All For You is a rock-opera type affair entitled Trust A Try, performed in existentialist masks & captivates you visually & audibly with heavy guitars, banging chorus & aggressively hypnotic dancing. We also are given a series of medleys which enable Janet to cover the canon of her career, while giving fans a full value for money experience. The ballads section covers 3 of Janet's greatest ballads including Come Back To Me which wasn't performed since Rhythm Nation tour -her voice is strong. The Escapade Medley continues the carnivalesque medleys set in the janet. tour. Some fans complain that there is no variety, but it condenses some of the songs perfectly - Miss You Much, Runaway, Escapade. My fave is the Control Medley, with an edgier chorus to WHYDFML, as also sung during the janet. tour. Nasty roks - big style. As fresh as it sounded in 1986. Still a fave. The final medley section is the chill-down smashes, TTWLG & Got Til Its Gone - janet & her singers. No visuals, the songs are there alone & you feel the groove. The audience laps it up & you appreciate the brilliance of these songs. Missy Elliott's inclusion in Son Of A Gun is the sole deviation from the Janet-Carly stand-alone performance throughout the tour. The audience laps it up & makes this DVD even more precious for those who got to see the tour. The saucy Would You Mind is a true riot, with janet in a very tight, hot cat-suit selecting a lucky male member (every pun included) from the audience for a suggestive 1-2-1 session on a gurny. Janet's selection of a male fan from the audience has always been a fave on her tours & this DVD not only shows you how on-the-tip janet is regarding her sexuality, but gives some fans a reminder of their few not-so-private moments with janet in front of thousands of fans, lol. The rest of the show is hot - mega hits Someone To Call, Together Again & Doesn't Really Matter help the fans chill, while Black Cat & if (which were omitted from half the tour because of exhaustion) are included again - I didn't see these songs performed and are two of my faves - they remind you just what a performer Miss Janet is. Exotic, Hypnotic & Erotic, and much, much more. The lady is a Superstar, this DVD testifies why!",1037059200,,3267,4.52027027027027
1742564,4,B00006CXI3,"I went to this show back in February with a friend, but was not initially going to go. I enjoyed it immensely, and the fact it was being filmed was great also! I had never been to a filmed concert before. One thing that you may not know, is that at the actual show, things were kinda messed up. The whole opening sequence went wrong when the dancers came down on the elevated platforms. When they got to the bottom, Janet et al. just walked off stage! We then had to wait a bit, and a guy came out and explained they were going to do it again! It was rather funny, but I'm sure Janet was mad! So what you see on the dvd, was actually a spliced version of two different opening sequences since the pyrotechnics did not occur the second time around. Anyway, the concert was ace, and I would recommend this DVD to anyone into Janet or the current state of Pop/R&B music today.",1035936000,3,873,4.2023809523809526
1742565,5,B00006CXI3,"It should be a 10 star, but it only goes up to five.  I love Janet very much, so of course she gets the highest bid from me.  I went to see her ""All For You"" concert at MSG, and I had the best time.  So when she was in Hawaii for the last stop I wanted to be there also, but since it was impossible, I just watched it on HBO.  I can't wait for her new album to come out so I can be the first to get it.  But if you haven't seen this yet, you must make it a priority to do so.

Please write a one liner and post if you have the same problem.  Janet we love you!  P.S. Where is Tina Landon (one of her original dancers and choerographer?)

Janet is the Jackson to watch from now on. ..., Ms. Jackson is the ticket! This dvd includes bonus features such as a picture gallery but it is the concert and Janet's rendition of her hits that will make any Janet fan run out and buy a copy of this dvd.

1742587,3,B00006CXI3,"I enjoyed this video but in my opion, it was not as good as the Velvet Rope video.  I though the song selections, dancers, costumes, camera work, etc., were better in Velvet Rope.  Live In Hawaii, has a few of Janet's newer songs and that is nice, but the camera seems too far away from the stage.  I would have liked some crisper close up shots.  Also, the band is hidden most of the time behind the backdrop, except when she brings the guitar player out.  So you can't really see the musicians performing.  I'd say get this only if you already have Velvet Rope and are desperate for more Janet.",1031788800,3,596,4.324324324324325

Nothing is as good as seeing her in person, but this is the next best thing!!!  Pick this one up now.  Don't miss it!  I sure didn't.  It's soo good, that I watched this DVD three times in a row.  I also enjoyed the bonus footage of his ""victims"" during the ""Would You Mind"" performances.  Another GREAT feature on this DVD would have to be the photo gallery.

From beginning to end this concert is majorly entertaining. Favourite songs like 'Got till its gone', 'Rythm Nation', 'Love will never do', 'Nasty' etc are all there. Plus excellent new songs like 'Trust' (great costumes), 'All for U' and Son of a gun' (with a nice surprise performance by Missy E. and taped images of Carly Simon).
With a new set of dancers and a band that clearly knows what its doing, this musical experience is a winner and one of the best concert DVD's out there.",1029110400,,744,4.601503759398496

1742593,5,B00006CXI3,"The concert begins with Janet running topless into a waterfall and it keeps getting better!
I loved the Velvet Rope Tour - it's probably still my fave by JJ - but this one is as good. The mood is lighter and a little less urgent than Velvet Rope, and it's probably a little more fun.
It begins with Janet on an elevated podium wiggling those awesome hips to the first strains of ""Come on Get Up"" - a club/house jam from ""All For You"" that she and the dancers pull off to perfection. She then stomps thru ""You Ain't Right"" and ""All For You"" before reaching into the way-back machine for ""Love Will Never Do.""
The costume/choreography highlight has to be the number for the rock-rave ""Trust a Try"" with the great Fellini-looking monster costumes great dancing. That's followed by the ballad segment - ""Come Back to Me,"" ""Let's Wait a While"" and ""Again.""
There's the usual whimsical playland medley sequence with Janet in Fantasyland doing ""Runaway,"" ""Miss You Much,"" ""When I Think of You"" and ""Escapade."" That's followed by an awesome, sexually-charged version of ""Son of a GUn"" featuring a brief appearance by Missy Eliott.
The mellow section features grooving versions of ""Got 'Til Its Gone"" and ""That's the Way Love Goes."" She follows with a medley of ""What Have You Done 4 Me Lately,"" ""Control"" and a version of ""Nasty"" that had the crowd of about 40,000 or so going Apesh...!
Next it's on to the 1940s street scene for ""Alright,"" followed by the R-rated ""Would You Mind"" performance in which some lucky dude from the audience gets strapped in and mounted by Janet in a dominatrix outfit.
The performance of ""If"" and ""Black Cat"" features an Asian motif, then Janet (in black leater) and the dancers blow the roof off (figuratively - they're in an open-air stadium) with a stomp thru ""Rhythm Nation.""
THey then exit the stage and return for the encore, a playful set of ""Doesn't Really Matter,"" ""Someone to Call My Lover"" and ""Together Again.""
In a word, it's a great audiovisual spectacular, just as you'd expect from Ms. Jackson. Musically, under the direction of guitarist Dave Barry, the band was tighter and more adroit than the ""Velvet Rope"" band. The dancing was great, the sets were great - it was all great.
In a summer (2001) of fantastic shows (madonna, mode...), this was a standout!",1027728000,9,2296,4.713930348258707
