thanks Lady M for making this dvd possible",1216425600,,215,3.8863636363636362
2826537,5,B000PMLGVK,"I found this video very easy to follow! I am a young newlywed, who was ,looking for something special for the honeymoon. The video is easy to follow, doesn't spend too long on any subject but each move is explain very well. It really motivates the sexy woman in you to show off your body no matter what your size. Loved it!",1214438400,2,323,4.225806451612903
2826538,5,B000PMLGVK,This is a great video. Very detailed instruction and goes slow enough to follow step-by-step.,1214352000,,93,5.266666666666667
2826539,5,B000PMLGVK,"This video was great! All the others I have watched made it so complex, yet this one made it fun and easy to follow. Lady Morrighan teaches both the dance routines and the body language that really makes it sizzle. This is the best DVD yet!",1205971200,6,240,4.239130434782608
2826540,4,B000PMLGVK,"This is the second program by Lady M . Her ease in instruction lures you from beginning to end without regards to time.
This program is captivating with much to learn. A sensual lesson in walking, floor work, and actual technique for a striptease. Three elements when combined allow your body to speak a different language!

Segment1:  exotic dance break down with choreography
Segment2:  floor work break down and choreography
Segment3:  strip tease done with a chair and a stuffed bear.

It is easy to follow along, Lady M is direct with her audience as she repeats and carefully plans out your next move.
I thoroughly enjoyed the floor work section, the moves are beautifully and gracefully executed.  Yoga sure came in handy in this section but can be a little challenging if you lack in flexibility. For me this program was instructional, easy and fun to do. A nice break from regimen and a personal gift as I embrace my feminine prowess.
The choreography demonstration merges all 3 choreographies with a few extras thrown in. Exciting, sensual, fun, all in good taste.",1191456000,29,1074,4.841530054644808
2826541,3,B000PMLGVK,"ITS DEF FOR BEGINNERS I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.I LIKE THE LEG FLOOR WORK.VERY GOOD.I GOT A FEW THINGS FROM IT.ITS SENSUAL AND SLOW.
IM MORE FACE PACED BUT THIS ONE IVE GOT TO DO CAUSE I NEED TO SLOW IT DOWN.PERFECT IF U GO OUT ON STAGE.SIMPLE.DEF W TURN THEM ON",1189382400,2,258,4.078431372549019
2826542,4,B000PMLGVK,"This is my first dvd on exotic dance, so I don't have much experience. As far as I'm concerned, I think the moves are well explained, even if I would have expected more on striptease issue. The entire routine is very sensual and it's also a good and pleasant workout to tone up your body!",1186963200,7,288,4.254545454545455
2826543,5,B000PMLGVK,"This dvd gives good instruction on how to dance an erotic routine and is easy for beginners to learn.  Step-by-Step instruction is given then the combo is reviewed.  Walking, floorwork, and chairwork are all covered and the final routine is very sexy looking! You will need a miniskirt, button-up shirt and a armless chair for the routine, but the dance can be modified if these items are not available.  A bonus performance by Lady Morrighan will knock your socks off and give the beginning dancer some good tips!",1185494400,23,514,4.818181818181818
2826564,4,B000PMLGVK,"Besides getting a little confused on which direction to do some of the moves, this video was great! It's pretty easy to follow and it's sexy fun. It's a great workout if you want to tone up. The music is also pretty good. I'd say worth the money. :)",1359244800,,249,4.1020408163265305
2826565,1,B000PMLGVK,I did not recive this product. I was hoping to learn befor my husband got home but I guess not,1353801600,,94,3.75
2826566,4,B000PMLGVK,Its a cool strip tease to learn if your just starting. Wish the dvd had more menu features to break down each move individually to practice til perfection until it moves on.,1353715200,,173,4.4375
2826567,1,B000PMLGVK,"This is a simplistic, sloppy, and superficial look at exotic dance, that doesn't teach well and isn't particularly interesting.  The uninspired choreography, with no context, explanation, suggestions, or real skill/dance involved, didn't guide the viewer into performing exotic dance well or sexily.  She doesn't talk about underlying dance technique, muscle use, or reasons behind the movements, and she doesn't explain what makes exotic dance so ""Irresistible,"" as the title of the DVD claims.  She didn't reverse the steps left-to-right, so that the viewer can mirror her, which makes the movements difficult to follow.  She demonstrated poorly, her voice was annoying and she had a terribly flat affect, and nothing, absolutely nothing, that you could learn in that DVD couldn't be taught in 15 minutes, with more compassion, understanding, excitement, and clarity.  She explained it terribly, and it wasn't sexy--that is, the idea of performing for a partner or even the dancer's reveling in her own sexuality, regardless of a spectator-- at all.",1336694400,4,1051,5.462962962962963
2826568,5,B000PMLGVK,"For the existing sensual or wanna-be sensual dancers only! After practicing with this DVD, you'll put a hurtin' on 'em when you surprise your lucky victim with a few new unexpected tricks that will surely captivate your prey. YOU will become the aphrodisiac! Lady Morrighan repeats each dance step several times and the dance steps are quite sultry. Even if you're beyond a beginner, this DVD will still teach you something new, will help you perfect your existing moves, or will help build your confidence. So far, this is one of the best instructional sexy-dance DVDs I've purchased. Can't wait to watch her other DVDs and learn more enticing moves.",1314835200,,651,4.927272727272728
2826569,1,B000PMLGVK,"I bought this thinking I was going to learn something. When I saw this video I found it ridicules and not sexy at all. I give a better and sexier lap dance. The instructor dances in front of a teddy bear and her moves are awful to me. If you're looking for a sexy dance, please find a better dvd.",1294963200,4,296,3.95
2826570,4,B000PMLGVK,"this dvd accomplished what i intended. I built up my confidence and learned how to perform a striptease for my husband. Although i expected more from this. moves seemed a little simple. i didn't do exactly the same routine, adjusting to my needs. it was a good start, i am thinking of getting another one.",1286064000,,305,4.5636363636363635
2826571,3,B000PMLGVK,"dance styles were fairly simple, easy to follow and i was inspire to learn the steps.  I kept going back for more practice and wanting to learn more.  The video is a good start to exotic dancing.",1272240000,,195,4.243243243243243
2826572,2,B000PMLGVK,"The instructor was great in her explanation and execution but the overall content of the DVD was very weak and I did not learn any new moves or rather any moves I would be able to do because I do not possess the flexibilty required. The cover art is a little deceptive because the dance was a slow Burlesque'like Style.

The first portion contained very basic movements and unfortunately only had a small handful. Basically, if you can already move your hips up, down, and side to side and take small steps then you have the first part down.

The next portion was the floorwork and if you are not flexible there is absolutely no way you will be able to do this. Usually, I just adjust the moves so I am able to do them at my level of flexibility but with this video it really was not an option. It is of course absolutely beautiful and I wish I was able to do them but not in this life. The bulk of the moves all required the ability to be able to do the splits. One move started with your arms straight on the floor, one leg bent down, and the other moving straight into the air in a splits position while shifting your weight. Another was a side position with a scissor splits where Lady M's leg is reaching about to her neck.

The Striptease portion included the basic hip movements and again moves that required so much flexibility that they could not even be modified. The DVD does contain lots of positive encouragement and the artist was very likable but the overall content was weak. Other tidbits include instruction on eye contact, hand placement, clothing choices, etcetera. However, this really was not what I was looking for and felt it should categorized under Exotic Dance Yoga.",1268784000,8,1693,4.45483870967742
2826573,5,B000PMLGVK,Lady M is fabulous in this instructional DVD.  I Really enjoyed her step by step approach to each movement and how well it was broken down.  It was easy to follow and the program was really inspiring!  Each segment was done well with the final routine as an example of how to put together your own private dance!  I think this DVD was well worth the money spent.  My husband was pretty impressed when I gave him his own private dance!  I can't wait to learn more!  I am hooked!!!!,1262736000,2,480,4.266666666666667
2826603,1,B000PMLGVK,"This video isn't what I thought at all. After reading other review on it prior to purchase, i thought it would be great learning tool. Well it's not at all that it does however give you step by step insturctions but nothing sexy about it or exotic to me. The moves it showed, I don't think are sexy or exotic enough needs a little more excitment to it. very disappoited.",1245456000,7,370,4.3
2826604,4,B000PMLGVK,"This is the first time buying a video in this category so i don't really have much to compare it with. However I bought it so that i could learn some moves to spice it up in the bedroom which this video provided. Very good for beginners to the art of exotic dancing. The dancing was a lot of fun and I became aware of a lot of things about my body. Later on when you get familiar with it, you can order more advanced DVDs. I definitely recommend it for beginners. I do wish though that the routine had been a bit longer.",1242950400,10,520,4.009615384615385
2826605,4,B000PMLGVK,The dvd is really cutesy and flirty. The routine is sexy. The instructor is fun but could explain things better.,1238716800,6,112,4.65
2826606,5,B000PMLGVK,"This DVD is exactly what I wanted.  I wanted to give my husband a lap dance and not feel totally silly doing it.  Lady M. goes through the steps of giving a lap dance and exotic dance.  I may not follow her exact steps, but I now have a dance prepared for him that he will definitely enjoy.  I liked how she shows how to ""strip"" and dance, but she still has layers of clothing on.  I felt like I was learning something rather than watching a porno which is what some other DVD's looked like.  Overall, I thought this was a great product.",1236902400,27,537,4.115384615384615
2826607,5,B000PMLGVK,Great video.  Shows step by step and breaks down the choreography.  Very professionally done.,1236643200,,93,5.571428571428571
2826608,5,B000PMLGVK,"Ok, I wanted to hate her, the cover is questionable, short hair...what exotic dancer has short hair?? C'mon...but she was great, fun to watch, fully explained chair, standing & floor work. Not so difficult that you'd never pick up the moves but hard enough to take practice to do well. Great costuming, she completely explains not only moves but the subtle actions that make a good dancer. Eye contact, music selection, flirting, hand placement, clothing removal (don't get excited, no nudity, just tips) etc. She demos a great 'lap' dance for a stuffed bear. We get the point without it being too intimate. Broken down into easy to understand segments then put together into full routines. Great fun, inspiring, & sassy. I'll definately purchase any other DVD's she offers.",1236038400,5,774,5.007751937984496
2826609,5,B000PMLGVK,"Nice and slow direction... unlike Carmen this is an ""instructional video"" not aerobic just seductive.",1235433600,5,101,5.8
2826610,5,B000PMLGVK,"Lady Morrighan has made an art of exotic dance; sensual, incredibly graceful, and never lapsing into vulgarity, and always with a bit of humor on the sidelines. The choreography is very easy to learn, the hard part is the smoothness of the style, if you have any awkwardness or angularity in the way you move. This DVD above all will teach you to slither slowly, seductively, beautifully, and should be a boon to young dancers and actresses who need to learn these kind of movements without looking coy on one side of the spectrum, or sleazy on the other side.

The simple choreography is broken up into smaller sections, making it a breeze to assimilate. There is the Exotic Dance section with Mae West movements, a floor work segment, and a final striptease and lap dance. A chair with an oversized bear is the audience, and I'm sure his little furry heart must skip a beat or 2 as Lady Morrighan does her tantalizing dance. This routine would be great for your special teddy bear, and will certainly add some spice to your marriage ladies!

The final performance is a lark, with an amusing costume (are those giraffe patterned tights?) and it's set to a fabulous jazzy bluesy rendition by Ron Sunshine of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Still-Too-Late/dp/B0013PFU74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Still Too Late</a>.

Lady Morrighan says ""There is one rule in exotic dance. Don't be shy""!",1233273600,3,1430,5.181818181818182
2826611,4,B000PMLGVK,"I bought both Lady M's dvds. I didn't find one harder than the other. The second one is contains more moves, but i liked the ending Demo in the first one better.

The instructor is respectful, careful, slow, patient with herself, and perfect at teaching shy people to be more bold with eye. She's a woman's woman, you admire her, you like her, you listen to her, she's non-threatening while being a sex-bomb all at once. In short, she's pretty much a delight, and really the perfect teacher for exotic dance.

She makes you want to buy a giant feather fan and get some pasties and stockings with bows on them, mix a cosmopolitan and just slowwwwwwwwwww down, baby, and pretend you are about to use your feminine moves search-out, seduce, then throughly destroy James Bond all without compromising your self-respect in the least.

My only complain is the moves were repeated slowly way too many times, and I don't get why they repeat something slowly twice or more, since that's what chapters on dvd's are designed for. That frustates and annoys me. I enjoyed all the costume changes tho! Loved that!

The ""full choreography"" routine at the end was a dissapointment in that it's full of talking, and stopping, and advice, where as that all should have been done the step-by-step and choreography parts of each routine. The final, full dance should be silent so you can concentrate on preforming.

But none of these complaints take away from the care or attention of the instructor or the sexy unhurried, unrushed atmosphere.

If you're a hardcore athelete or a pole dancer, this will be way too slow and easy unless you are looking *to* slow down.

I'm glad I own it. As a final visual reference, think of a britney spears video melting *very* slowly......",1227830400,29,1755,4.7344262295081965
2826612,4,B000PMLGVK,"Very fun workout, keeps you interested to learn the whole routine for future use!  Good workout too...gets you sweating! The only thing is I'm not 21 anymore and my knees were killing me!  I bought thin knee pads so I could continue to do the workout.",1222214400,7,251,4.434782608695652

8192748,5,B000PMLGVK,"Lady M is terrific! I love her stripper DVD too. In this DVD, Lady M has no exercise routine, but in three parts she explores some stripper moves and floor work and ends with a nice lap dance. I practice it every morning.",1415577600,2,221,4.162790697674419
8192749,1,B000PMLGVK,Not impressed,1411689600,,13,6.0
8192750,5,B000PMLGVK,while the backround isn't much to look at. i really don't mind. it kinda gives the feeling im learning from a friend. however the moves in this dvd are some of my favorite from her 4 dvds on exotic dance. As i mentioned on another reveiw ive done all the dvds and do enjoy them all. also i purchased these directly from the WDNY wedsite. the charge shipping but it was quick. i have bought most WDNY bellydance workout dvds on amazon. anyways back to the review. some people are saying she cant dance...watch the dvd promo on youtube and see if you want it. i think she dances nicely and my husband think i do just fine ;),1409356800,,622,4.235294117647059
8192751,3,B000PMLGVK,"The instructor looks charming and professional, but instructions are not clear. No mirror, no demonstration from the back, kind of fast pace. Some moves I just can't understand, because they are not broken down properly.  She speaks in a soft voice, music is too loud; also, she looks like she doesn't feel comfortable in front of the camera. So far Im not very impressed.
Update: Im making my way through this DVD,and still the same issues. Not very good instructions. I have to pause every second and try to copy her position; she just shows the move quickly and says something like ""up and turn, up and turn"".  She doesn't give any tips about posture and how to make the move look nice. To make it worse, the camera changes angles constantly, so it's even difficult to copy her moves looking at her. It takes  too much effort to figure out what exactly she is doing,  which direction she is turning etc. I think i will be able to manage, because the moves are really pretty and I want to learn them, but this instructor definitely doesn't make it easy. She is obviously a better dancer than instructor.",1397779200,2,1105,4.565656565656566
