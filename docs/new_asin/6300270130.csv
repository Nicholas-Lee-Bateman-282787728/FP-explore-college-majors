Of course the story was as good as ever although it seemed to move more slowly now.  What spoiled our enjoyment was the quality of the colour.  Tape 1 was very ""washed out"".  We wondered if our NTSC to PAL system was failing.  The second tape had much better colour so our system is OK (Thank goodness!).  With prior knowledge of the colour qualty we might not have bought the the tapes.  I suppose that, on reflection, this would have been our loss.",1033948800,,546,4.294117647058823

304131,5,6300270130,"Another of Jules Verne's wonderful books put on film... somewhat.  A somewhat decent transferral from book to film.  At any rate, it's a lively and entertaining movie.  A good family movie.  If you want a film for kids (as well as yourself), and want to see some good adventure, with lots of big stars making cameo appearances, this is a good place to begin.  Shirley MacLaine is actually pretty good in this, something I surprise myself by saying.  David Niven and Robert Newton are superb; Niven as the fastidious Phileas Fogg and Newton as the London detective following him around the world.  I'm anxiously looking forward to seeing this wide screen adventure put onto DVD.",1022889600,4,677,4.834782608695652
304132,5,6300270130,"O.K., the film is still quite good, but the DVD transfer is not  as good as it could have been.  As one who saw 80 Days repeatedly in Todd-AO during its 70mm run, I can tell you that it was so sharp and bright that one could almost reach out and touch Fogg's carpetbag -- or smell it.  The SOUND on the DVD is COMPRESSED, and had better dynamics in one of the two VHS versions.  Now that's sad!  The rest of my original review of the tape version applies to the DVD.  Here it is, slightly revised.  Many reviews suggest that the film, although good, is not as effective as it once was because our tastes have sharpened over the years. You might be suspicious that our enormous sophistication is not the most important variable if you realize the following: 1)the decline has been Gargantuan -- the film won awards all over the world, played well over a year in virtually all of its Todd-AO releases, and drew wild applause at both the intermission and as the end credits appeared (at least every time I saw it) 2)the decline cannot be attributed to the dialogue, because it is still witty, and not at all unsophisticated, though it is broadly satirical 3)the visual humor is almost as funny as remembered from 1956 4)Niven & Cantinflas can only be described as perfect in their roles. The problem is that BOTH the VHS tape transfer and the new DVD do not adequately reproduce the glorious images, or the magnificently bouncy score, played by one of the largest orchestras in the history of film, and captured in one of the best 6 channel magnetic recordings ever.  This is a movie that was often characterized by critics as a ""romp,"" but there is not much romp left in the DVD or VHS versions. You CAN get a little of the joy and the bounce back by using a good stereo sound system, and cranking up the volume. One distinctive feature of the film is that there was very little background music; it was FOREGROUND music! The montage and music interlocked amazingly well. After the prologue (the one part of the film that IS dated) turn up the sound of the marching band to the level of a LIVE brass band, and leave it at least at that level....that's the way it was in Todd-AO, and that's the way it should be!  The original sound had quite wide dynamic range, incorporating great, joyful surges of sound.  One place this happened was just before the intermission, when the music level went up magnificently. Try this: as the intermission approaches, just after Shirley MacLaine says ""We're out of British jurisdiction now"" turn up the volume smoothly but quickly, then, on the cut to the next shot, PUNCH it up. You will feel the exhilaration, and you will see why people clapped.  As a DVD played through a good audio system, ""80 Days"" would probably make my top 100 list, and certainly is the best realization of Jules Verne on screen. As it was in Todd-AO, on the hypnotically large, deeply curving screen, it just might make my top 10.",996278400,16,2939,4.5056390977443606
304133,5,6300270130,"Around the World in 80 Days has aged better than most think. The film does show alot of long cinematic scenes. But it is funny (The ending is just hilarous, if you get it).

As most movies are, it isn't nearly as good as the  book was, but I still found it very entertaining and recommend it to movie  lovers of any age.

One of the major  assets of the film is Cantinflas, Mexico's greatest comedian, in his only  American film brings the perfect comic touch to the film. One of the major  flaws is that the film doesn't make full use of his comedic abilities, one  or two scenes of Cantinfla's usual slapstick would of made the film more  tolerable. David Niven is in top forma as the elegant and punctual Philleas  Fog. A very young and darkened Shirley MacLaine appears in a small role as  a beautiful Indian princess.

304224,2,6300270130,"Review of ""Around the World in 80 Days""
Hot Toasty Rag, June 26, 2017

Michael Todd, Hollywood and Broadway producer and one-time husband to Elizabeth Taylor, put up six million dollars in his quest to make Around the World in Eighty Days the greatest film of all time. And in 1956, that was an unheard of amount of money to spend on a movie. It won the Oscar for Best Picture, but nowadays, its kind of looked at as that balloon movie with a hundred people in it.

If you ask someone about the plot, hell probably hesitate and basically repeat the title. The plot is not the focus of the film; the cameos are. Todd recruited forty Hollywood stars, in addition to David Niven in the lead and Shirley MacLaine in a smaller role, to wave at the camera and make the audience squeal with delight as they say, Oo! Theres Frank Sinatra/Charles Boyer/Marlene Dietrich/Cesar Romero/Buster Keaton/Charles Coburn/George Raft/John Gielgud/Glynis Johns! If you want to see forty Hollywood stars turned into glorified extras, and a story about a man in a hot air balloon appeals to you, go ahead and see it. It is a classic, and it did win Best Picture.",1498435200,,1140,4.610837438423645

I am sure that in its day, the film was staggering in its appeal, but not at all today. It is way too long, scenes being dragged out to ridiculous lengths at times. The acting is a bit embarrassingly bad.

Resolution was poor, colors accurate but muddled because of definition.  If you must have the story, buy it but be aware the quality of the picture is mediocre by current standards.  Maybe it plays well on a small 40"" TV, but not on a large one.  After 1 minute with the main story I concluded it wasn't worth watching.  Sorry to deliver this message because I wanted so much to see a reasonable resolution version.

304529,4,6300270130,"This 1956 classic is special in many ways. It includes an introduction that tells you about Michael Todd's complete devotion to making this movie the right way. Then the movie is absolutely beautiful, and the music is just as wonderful as the story. It is not loosely based on Jules Vern's novel. It is tightly based on it. The cast was chosen wisely. A widescreen format was developed for the film at Michael Todd's request. And Oh! The music! It's just wonderful. It was scored by Victor Young and it is Oh! So Sweet!  If all this doesn't wow you, the cameo appearances will. Keep a sharp eye out for many faces from Hollywood's hey day. These too, are delightful.

This will seem dated, but nevertheless, this is gem! It is a jewel among rhinestones. Don't hesitate. Buy it! It is a movie that can be passed on to your grandchildren's grandchildren. It's always a thrill to open the case and play the DVD once a year.",1451520000,,920,4.502994011976048

304567,5,6300270130,"In 1956, astonishingly, AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS raked in $100 million globally, this in an era when movies cost only 50 cents. It's a sweeping, rollicking, star-studded, yet unpretentious Best Picture adaptation of the Jules Verne classic. And while it presents David Niven as the main protagonist, let's not front. It's Cantinflas' world. Niven's just paying rent. Cantiflas is such an impish and exuberant presence here.

If you don't know this famous novel, treat what's next like cliff notes: In 1872 a rather mysterious Englishman by name of Mr. Phileas Fogg (Niven) wagers 20,000 against his fellow members of the elite London Reform Club that he can circumnavigate the globe in eighty days. But what's a gentleman to do when adventure beckons and he has no valet to mind him? A stroke of serendipity lands Mr. Fogg one such as Passepartout (Cantinflas), that agreeable vagabond, responds to his advertisement.

Passepartout fancies himself a connoisseur of women, but never mind that. We come to treasure him as an invaluable jack-of-all-trades - his bonafides number among them skills as a fireman, a professor of gymnastics, a trapeze artist, a chimney sweep... and, as we learn later on, a flamenco dancer and a bullfighter. Mr. Fogg is a bit of a cold fish, a man of precision and punctuality and who adheres to a rigidly scheduled regimen of diet and activities. Off they go to see the world and win a wager by way of train, steamship, hot air balloon, and other, more exotic means of conveyance. Somewhere en route, the mismatched pair will rescue the imperiled Princess Aouda (Shirley MacLaine). They'll endure the vexation-on-legs that is Scotland Yard's Mr. Fix (Robert Newton) who suspects Fogg of purloining 55,000 from the venerable Bank of England. Time and again, they'll suffer the indignities of a fastidiously orchestrated itinerary gone t! ts up. What's that they say? Man plans, God laughs? Oh, but they'll have grand adventures, and galore.

Time and again, it's Passepartout who saves the day. Not that he's the perfect gentleman's gentleman, mind you. Passepartout has his foibles, most notably his eye for da ladies. But he's got such a good, warm heart and he's so loyal. And resourceful. He makes a striking contrast to Niven's aloof, orderly Victorian globetrotter. Even the dick move Passepartout pulls where he exposes an Indian snake charmer is executed so impishly and so casually I couldn't help but chuckle and go, ""Oh, you."" Cantinflas as Passepartout reminds me so much of Chaplin's Little Tramp, only chattier.

Michael Todd was a Broadway showman who had never before produced a movie until this movie, and his scope was ambitious, his undertaking mammoth. To quote the host on TCM, this film made use of ""over one hundred locations, 140 sets, and 75,000 costumes."" AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS is perhaps the most celebrated travelogue in cinema. Yes, the film crew actually went to all those far-flung places.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but this may also be the first movie that enjoyed a huge cast of notable cameos, stars who went in for a quick second just so they could say they were in the movie. This movie predates IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD, maybe the movie that features the most number of celebrity cameos, by seven years.

With all the precarious predicaments sustained by Fogg, Passepartout, and Princess Aouda, it's the final ten minutes that best convey that thrilling frisson as a mopey Fogg unexpectedly snatches victory from the jaws of defeat. It's such a fun, galvanizing twist that I never saw coming when I first read the book. That Jules Verne kid, he's a comer.",1446508800,,3636,4.923327895595432

304864,5,6300270130,"I love this film and consider it a masterpiece.  Its an adventure story that takes you around the world and manages to include subtle humor that does not diminish that adventure.  It is the perfect blend of adventure and comedy.  As a child this movie opened my eyes to the various cuiltures of the world and wet my apetite to learn about diversity.

The content is kept pretty clean with only subtle hints at sexuality... Its done far tasytefully than today.  Plus Mr. Fogg never takes advantage of the woman under his protection and agrees to marry her before doing anything which is a theme not often shown in today's plotlines.... But for those of us who love marrying true gentlmen its nice to see one presented on tv.

The casting of both Mr. Fogg and his manservant was exceptional.  It was sheer brilliance to cast a Latino instead of the book's Frenchman as the manservant... And the movie has lasted through time because of it.  I also live in a mostly Latino community so the choice better matches the world I grew up in.

Yes there are stereotypes in this film.  All the characters are in some way over exaggerated, but that is part of the movies humor yet in a way its also why this movie serbes as social comentary and can address real topics. I did not find this film stifling my opinions or ideas about people or ethnicities... But instead a desire to learn more.  For every negative person in a particular culture you are also given positive examples.  The movie also shows the confussion of cross cultural interactions and instilled in me a desire to understand why those misunderstandings occurred.  In fact, I feel I could use clips from this film to bring up and discuss multiculturalism and personal bias with my children.... So in the end, i do not feel the stereotypes are harmful or antagonistic.

Lastly, the various cameos by famous personalities like Red Skilton and Frank Sinatra were done very tastefully and added an additional layer of fun to the film.

I would have no problem showing this film to an 8 year old even if needed to do so by watching small clips at a time then researching and discussing.",1424044800,,2135,4.596306068601583

304922,3,6300270130,"Michael Anderson's film is justifiably memorable for its huge cast, its memorable photography (by Lionel Linden), its catchy theme tune (Victor Young), and its sheer brio.  It remains producer Mike Todd's crowning achievement, a lasting legacy for a showman whose life was brutally curtailed by an air-crash in 1958.  The epic is held together by two memorable performances from David Niven as Phileas Fogg and Cantinflas as his loyal servant Passepartout.

Structurally speaking, however, AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS is a mess.  There are some memorable individual sequences - for example, at the beginning when Fogg makes a bet in London's Reform Club with his fellow-members (Finlay Currie, Ronald Squire, Trevor Howard, Basil Sydney); or the brief exchange at the domestic services agency involving Fogg's former manservant (John Gielgud) and the proprietor (Noel Noward).  Later on Fogg has a memorable exchange with the Indian Peninsular Railway Official (Ronald Colman), in which the two actors compete for who can speak their lines in the best RP (Received Pronunciation) accent.  Once Fogg crosses to the United States, he has another memorable encounter with a Barbary Coast saloon pianist (Frank Sinatra).

Yet such sequences are often separated by long stretches of film where nothing really happens: Passepartout has a long bull-fighting sequence, watched by Fogg and Achmed Abdullah (Gilbert Roland), that becomes tedious; likewise the funeral sequence where Fogg saves Princess Aouda (Shirley MacLaine) from death seems to be included simply to show off director Anderson's love of local color.

In the end the experience of watching the film becomes an exercise in identifying the stars playing cameo roles - for a film buff of the mid-twentieth century, this can be a fascinating experience, but perhaps not to most viewers' taste.  Nonetheless, it's fun to see actors such as Robert Newton, Joe E. Brown, Peter Lorre, John Carradine, John Mills, Glynis Johns, Hermione Gingold and even Buster Keaton in cameo roles.  If you blink too much, you might miss them.

David Niven doesn't have too much to do in this film, other than to reinvent his familiar screen persona as an urbane man-about-town, perpetually faced with the responsibility of taming his manservant's excesses.  Nonetheless he does his task competently.

AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS is an exhausting experience to watch, but one that still communicates incidental pleasures, especially to viewers from an older generation.",1420588800,3,2512,5.361323155216285

It stars David Niven as Fogg doing what he did best (stuffy British type obsessed with time), a very young Shirley McLaine as a run-away widow and eventual love interest for Fogg, and Cantinflos as Fogg's bulter. The humor is dated- of course. There are many stereotypes in the film that will offend some people. I've watched this films many times over the years and on the most recent viewing really paid attention to the physical comedy of Cantinflos-something I did not originally appreciate. He was a true genius of slapstick from a bygone era. The film also has dozen's of cameo appearances by fading and current stars-some of these are people that are no longer remembered as stars by the current generation. So it is a nice retrospective.

305236,5,6300270130,"Fantastic movie, made in an era of sensational budgets and Cecile B. DeMille, who knew how to tell a story with all the trimmings.  Lavish scenes featuring hundreds of extras; small parts featuring stars that had been lighting Hollywood's skies for decades.
And of course, the main characters.  To truly understand what they brought to the show, I had to watch it with the commentary on, and my word what I learned.
David Niven balances the show with his faithful portrayal of the painfully formal Mr. Fogg, while at the same time demonstrating his understanding of the storyline and the character's growth on the days when they shot ""out of order"" as it's called.  Shirley MacLaine portrays the female counterpart and handles the one-sided romance with finesse.  Cantinflas adds a dash of physical energy to the show, in the hot-air balloon, as a matador, climbing along the top of a train, etc., etc.
If you're in a hurry, don't watch this movie.  It takes its time getting where its going, first because the story was originally written in 1873 and second because it was filmed by someone who was capable of capturing the way life was before the invention of airplanes (let alone jets).

It usually just so happens that that film is one that the world in general adores and I feel like an outsider looking in, scratching my head as to why in the world this particular film is so popular and why in the world it is holding the title `Best Film of the Year'.

It happened with `Slumdog Millionaire'.

It happened with `Forrest Gump'.

It happened with `Around the World in 80 Days'.

Sitting back to watch this whirlwind extravaganza, I was expecting something cheeky, charming, fun and memorable.  What I was left with was a cluttered film that was visually appealing and marginally entertaining but ultimately underwhelming.  While the plot itself intriguing and fun, the execution is remarkably lazy.  Yes, there is a lot going on, and there are intricacies that litter the film's development, but they are just thrown together without much stringing them along, and the lifeless performances make this film feel so bland and uninteresting despite being interesting in concept.

This film is a visual marvel though, especially for the time, and I'm sure the world was swept up in the epic scenery and huge cast, but this isn't a film that has aged well apparently.",1379980800,3,1249,4.826291079812207

He persuaded 44 international stars and cinema veterans to appear briefly for very low fees or luxury gifts, just for the fun of participating. The big-screen version of Jules Verne's classic novel stars David Niven in perfect form as the globe-trotting Phileas Fogg, the obsessive and mysterious figure, who may have robbed the Bank of England. It's also graced by the gifted Mexican comedian Cantinflas as Fogg's manservant Passepartout, and a miscast but appealing Shirley MacLaine as the Indian princess Aouda. Shot in a 70-millimeter widescreen process called Todd-AO, which Todd pioneered, the location sequences are spectacular, particularly a cross-country train trip through India, the famous balloon journey over France, and some gorgeous shots across various bodies of water. Tremendously entertaining for all ages, it boasts a lovely, witty score by Victor Young, including the beautiful title number.

305325,2,6300270130,"This movie is from a different time, one that is well before mine. Now, I know that books that are turned into movies can't remain 100% faithful to the book. But I literally just finished the book hours before watching this. I was disappointed 5 minutes in when Passepartout was played by a Spaniard, not a Frenchman. Between the movie not following the book(balloon across the Alps into Spain?) and a poor WiFi connection, I didn't get beyond 20 minutes in. But I don't think I missed much.

I can see, in 1956, why this was a big deal. The travelogue quality to the whole movie, the fact it shined a light on different cultures (with a 50's mentality) the cameos by those actors long ago. It's easy to forget how ""closed"" the world was in 1956, certainly not like now or even twenty years ago. And yet it was shrinking, just like in the movie.

Other people have said it better, so I'll be short. The characters and the plot of the book that I saw in my head while reading, didn't come to life on my laptop screen. The actor playing Fogg is too stiff but with none of the heart of the character he's based on. The highly animated(and womanizing?) Passepartout just doesn't fit the book character at all. Passepartout is lively in the book, but still reserved. The men at the Reform club were as I pictured, typical British gentlemen's club in 1870, 1890, 1910,etc.

So if you were expecting the book to come to life on whatever screen you're watching it on, don't rent or buy this.",1371600000,2,1483,4.444852941176471

305329,2,6300270130,"I remember,  as a child, the sense of awe in the movie theater as the special Todd-AO equipment revved up. The sententious introduction by Edward R. Murrow made us feel that we were about to witness a momentous, almost religious, event.

It turns out that this film, although it does have its amusing moments,  is sort of the Seinfeld of big-cinema epics, i.e. a show about nothing,  or, to be a little more generous, about itself.  The iconic moment for me is James Coburn in a 60 second cameo part, looking hapless and without any purpose whatsoever, standing there, waiting for the take to end.  There are I suppose a couple of good cameos -- Dietrich and Sinatra -- but most of them come to naught.

The stars of the show barely exist. Niven is a cardboard cutout.  The Cantinflas routines range from mildly amusing to boring -- he must have been much better in his Spanish language films, which I don't know.  Shirley Maclaine walks through her part and, presumably, collects her check.

The storyboard, pacing, and editing are strange,  with long dull patches. I guess the balloon sequences near the beginning are among the better ones.

This daddy of all epic motion pictures enjoyed a consecutive three year run at Manhattan's Tivoli theater (1956-59).

In AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS, English adventurer Phileas Fogg wagers fellow Reform Club members that with all the available modern methods of late 19th Century transportation, he'll be able to circumnavigate the globe in barely 11 weeks. Fogg (Niven) and manservant Passepartout (Cantinflas) set off on a memorable journey filled with colorful sites and unusual people.

Popular Mexican actor Cantinflas is really the star of this Oscar-winning super-widescreen, stereophonic Mike Todd travelogue that's based on Jules Verne's novel.

Nifty closing credits by Saul Bass condense a three hour story to a handful of minutes and illustrate what actors cameoed in which scene. Not included during the finale is an ""extras"" list of nearly 1,000 names, longest in motion picture history (see full cast at IMDb).

The largest-ever Hollywood production set other staggering records: most costumes (74,685), over 4 million air miles logged, 68,894 extras in 13 countries, 8,552 animals used, 140 sets at a half-dozen Hollywood studios, plus in Japan, Hong Kong and England. Most astounding of all: total budget for a 75 day shoot (including Marlene Dietrich's $300K gown) was only $6 million!

I can't believe this is rated 4.5 out of 5. Really? Maybe it was 4.5 out of 5 when
it came out and world travel wasn't common and the specticale made up for how
poor the rest of the movie is.. Now though 50% or more of the movie
is spent on travel scenery and it's not even impressive scenery like like say
Lawerence of Arabia. You can see better scenery on the National Geographic channel
or the Travel Channel.

The rest is slow. The comedy too silly for the subject matter. David Niven's character
is wholy unlikeable. The 20 something woman falling for the 50 something man cliche' from
that period is completely unbelievable. There's no chemistry and if she was going to fall
for anyone she should be falling for the man who actually saved her, not his ""master"".

and has nothing to do with anything.",1332288000,4,979,4.403314917127072

I can only imagine what it was like back in 1956 to see this film.  I highly recommend it to any film fan and at the current price of $9.99 it is a steal for this 2 disc version.  I am glad they gave so much attention on the special features.  This film makes me want to travel the world and have an adventure before I cross over to the other side.  They are restoring films for Blu Ray like Ben Hur, The Wizard of Oz etc. and this should be on the list.  Dont get me wrong though, it is still a beautiful print and very colorful.

305427,5,6300270130,"Thumbs up from the whole family.  While the movie does show it's age (over 55 years old now), it's still a lot of fun.  As others have mentioned, Cantinflas as Passepartout is the centerpiece of the show.  But what a centerpiece!  It's easy to see why he was so highly regarded in his day.  And it's hard to go wrong with David Niven as Phileas Fogg.  Shirley MacLaine probably wouldn't have been my choice to play the Indian princess Aouda, but that's not to say she was bad at all.  Just a curious choice.

The movie isn't totally faithful to the book (hot air balloon, bullfighting) but the changes do not detract from story as far as I'm concerned.  And there are plenty of special features.

""Around the World..."" is a great three-hour ride.  Compared to the Pierce Brosnan and Jackie Chan versions, I'll take this one every time (and I like Brosnan and Chan!).  Finally, for the price (currently $9.99), this movie is a steal.",1327363200,2,932,4.548192771084337

305450,4,6300270130,"I watched the 1989 TV miniseries version of `Around the World in 80 Days' and wrote in my review that it was the truest interpretation of a Jules Verne novel I'd seen but having watched this movie I'll have to say that this one is even more accurate. The casting includes some interesting choices. David Niven is excellent as Phileas Fogg and Mexican comedian Mario Moreno is a rather offbeat choice to play Frenchman Jean Passepartout but the very white Shirley MacLaine playing Indian Princess Aouda is a real disappointment for me and I found her acting flat. Besides being Mexican, Moreno's character has also changed into a girl obsessed. acrobat. I have to give the 1989 miniseries the nod for casting with Eric Idle at least pretending to be French and Peter Ustinov being a much more memorable Detective Fix. Julia Soul is no more Indian than MacLaine but at least she's part Asian. It may be sacrilege but I actually preferred Brosnan's version of Fogg although he benefited by writing that actually gave him the opportunity to create a fleshed out character.

Besides the classic balloon ride which doesn't appear in the book and a trip to Spain the movie stays fairly close to the main plot of the book. I was worried during the Spain portion that the movie was going to drag when Passepartout was involved in a bullfight for what seemed like a good 10 minutes. There was also a long scene of a Spanish dancer. My fear was that the film was only long because of a huge amount of padding but the bullfight was definitely the most padded out scene. The ending is fairly true to the book with some odd tweaks but after a 3 plus hour movie the payoff is rather poorly executed and ends abruptly. Another issue I had was David Niven who was a picture perfect Phileas Fogg as the unflappable English gentlemen who must have his tea even when riding in a balloon. The problem was that he was in some ways rather soulless. In the book he punches Detective Fix in the face for wrongly imprisoning him but in the movie he just walks away a gentleman to the end. Niven is so stoic and immovable that the sudden proposal of marriage at the end to Aouda seems to come from out of nowhere. The Brosnan version had a much better lead up to the romance and he DID punch Fix.

The biggest treat in the movie is all the lovely location scenes. If nothing else it's a very attractive movie to look at. Some of the scenes are clearly set pieces but many are on location with some very nice cinematography and a neat view of the world of 1956 (although it's meant to be the 1800's). Besides the wonderful cinematography which is a perk of being a big budget Hollywood release I have to give the nod to the 1989 version which had better casting, better writing and a superior ending. This movie seemed to sacrifice characterization for set pieces and sprawling landscapes. In the book there was a lot more focus on the interactions of Fix and Passepartout which mostly gets glossed over here. This relationship was rather important in the book and would have made for a better movie. So what we have here is an often lovely but generally decent film that's rather long. It is however a great example of a 1956 major movie release. It's just not good enough that I'd want to actually own it.",1310774400,2,3279,4.5
305451,5,6300270130,"The bullfight sequence of Around the World in 80 Days, while not part of Jules Verne's novel, is alone worth the price of renting this movie or buying it used.  Apparently humorous, the bullfight sequence is in fact filmed on location in an old Spanish town and includes as extras the most famous matadors of the mid-20th century and costumes that are actually museum pieces.

The rest is also an enjoyable romp if you don't need a lot of CGI effects and explosions to get through a film.  Scenes of The Reform Club will appeal to ""chap""s of all nationalities, and the film is broadly anglophilic.  It verges on being epic while managing to keep from taking itself seriously--e.g., Princess Aouda as a love interest who is attracted to the protagonist's punctuality and love of whist.  The movie is marked by a number of caricature lines such as the title of this review.

How many films these days have an intermission?  If you decide to sit through, do not despair of the tiresome cowboys and Indians in the second half, as the last scenes of the film recapture the first half's sense of adventure.  The end title sequence by Saul Bass is also worth watching in its own right.

305454,3,6300270130,"When you base *anything* on Jules Verne, it's likely you're not going to turn up a turkey - here and there in this grand epic of epics, we get the feeling the Director should have concentrated on sitcoms, although in 1956, some of them very pretty darn good.

Niven is Fogg, played with *extra* restraint and Cantinflas is his newly hired servant, who finds himself one day jumping the line in the Employment Office and the next day jumping the International time line. He's not given many funny lines but he's great to watch, a poker-faced clown with a strategem, and an uncanny knack at walking right up to loose bulls and getting them to retreat; a great acrobatic performer. By 2011, the stereotyping is so obvious it's a combination history lesson and campy look-back at a quieter, simpler, more controlled society.

The English aristocracy is also ensconsed in stereotype - i fact, the movie only works when we watch ""recognisable"" characters in other countries and cultures, as Team Fogg wneds its' way across the globe.

The uninitiated might expect alot more ""balloon"" considering that terrific artwork on the VHS jacket! Don't want to give it all away........

I saw this picture in 1956 or 1957 with my Father and naturally wanted to watch it again - couldn't remember much that i saw as a 6 year old. But the scene in which Niven and Cantinflas swoop down in the Alps to find something to keep that good booze - undoubtedly ripped off (?) from the gentleman's club where the ""wager"" was made - as chilled as possible!

Shirley MacLaine is made up as an ""Indian princess"" rescued from ""sacrifice"" by the two. She does okay but speaks about 5 lines. Mostly does reaction takes.

A big problem is that the movie does not know whether it's a respectable tribute to Jules Verne or a Hollywood party reel - fun to see dozens of major stars of the day all over the map in happy little cameos but it leaves the viewer a bit edgy...is this really literature translated for the screen?

Another guarantee - like the Jules Verne guarantee of a fun story - is a miraculous soundtrack - thanks to Victor Young.

Victorian gentleman and his valet make a bet that they can go round the world in eighty days.
Amiable large-scale pageant resolving itself into a number of sketches, which could have been much sharper, separated by wide screen spectacle. What was breathtaking at the time seems generally slow and blunted in retrospect, but the fascination of recognizing 44 cameo stars remains.

305457,5,6300270130,"Where do I begin to praise this film?

Mike Todd was a madman.  It's our good fortune that his madness was in the form of promoting and producing quality work (alas, this was his only movie).

He was an original but he shared a pattern of taking shortcuts that only great genius' could pull off.

Nowadays we're impressed by men with lofty degrees who give us mediocre output.  Todd quit high school to make and loose a fortune, start a failed construction school and settle down to construct sets in Hollywood backlots.

Not for long, though.  He had a series of successes on Broadway and Hollywood called him back.

Taking on ""80 Days"" when everyone told him not to, he proceeded to make Barnum look like a choirboy and made a film that's so much fun most of us remember it to this day.

Epic in scope (as all those ""let's beat television"" movies were, back then) it's got a really human element to it.

Todd invented the ""Cameo"" appearance and the director, Michael Anderson, gave each star a little moment to shine in the film.

As an American of Mexican extraction, I can only say Cantinflas carries the movie on his tiny but capable shoulders.  He is actually very low-key in his performance as he is a broader comedian in his own films in Mexico.

Then there's Fix.  Robert Newton was a popular actor among British boys in the '40's and '50's, but his antics during filming in other films hurt him.  This was his last film but he gives a relentless energy to his role as the antagonistic Inspector Fix.

David Niven is one of my top 10 favorite actors (along with Ronald Coleman, who has a cameo in the film as well).  His sedate, undercurrent acting makes for a almost on the nose portrayal of Mr. Fogg of Saville Row.

Lastly there's the biggest actor of all, the cinematography.

If you have a wide-screen (and who the heck doesn't?) this is the movie you have to get.  Do yourself a favor and buy the letterbox version.  You will not be disappointed.  The Oscar of best Cinematography is well earned here and Lionel Linden should be remembered for this effort.

This film won five Oscars.  Those not impressed by that, well this time around the Oscar folks got it right.

Now, as for which version you should buy.  This is a caveat I gave earlier and I'm giving it more forcefully now.

I got the ""fulfilled by Amazon"" cheapie and now regret it.  The DVD had dropouts during the Robert Osborne introduction and, thus, I couldn't watch it past that point.  Amazon apologized, but if you're going to buy this film get the Amazon inventory version.

Don't settle for less when it comes to the best movies of all time.",1301097600,2,2625,4.5

As I watched the movie in all its glorious color and wide screen majesty, I began to wonder how it got to win the Academy Award for best picture. The scenes were more like a photographed stage play with little regard for the usual long shot, medium shot, and close up. Then I realized that a close up (and there was one) of a face would fill the gigantic screen and scare the audience! Of course on a small TV screen this is not a problem, so I granted the filmmaker a tip of the hat for realizing the HUGE Todd-AO had to have new rules of the language of film.
This is a great reissue of the classic movie and the stereo sound, wide screen and great color are all there just as in 1956.",1268265600,,927,4.0162162162162165

True, it's over three hours long and it doesn't have much action, but you'll look past it once you are entranced by the dazzling scenery and top-notch humor. Some might be put off by the worldly stereotypes and how they are played with much comedy, but keep in mind that it was indeed the 50's, and times were different back then. Aside the fact that the film has some great visuals and some great humor, David Niven and Mario Moreno make probably one of the most unlikely duos in cinema. The different personalities of their characters (named Phileas Fogg & Passepartout) kind of reminds me of Abbot and Costello, except that Moreno is playing an unusually humorous ""straight man"". People always say that Moreno reminds them of Charlie Chaplin, and it's pretty obvious here. His way of performing comedy is brilliant, and I don't think anyone would top that in recent remakes (*cough* Jackie Chan *cough*). So if you're into big-budget adventures films with loads of charming scenery and a great sense of humor, then the original version of Around The World In 80 Days is for you.",1268265600,2,1225,4.783018867924528

Before that, I saw, not only the Henry Levin (with Pat Boone and James Mason) movie but also the Rick Wakeman musical redemption to the story and after that, got the book and from that, I started to read the other Jules Verne books. I first got interested in Jules Verne because of Doc Brown from the BTTF trilogy.

Around the World in 80 Days is one of Verne's finest ones, and I still have it today like a groundbreaking tale.

The Michael Todd's version to the book is the most accurate one you can find. Of course, there's some adaptations, like Passepartout not being a french guy like in the book, but those things are OK, because there's so much fun on this!! No wonder why it earned an Oscar and other thousand awards.

There are plenty of everything in the movie, it's truly a fun ride around the world. And above all that, it's truly a fantastic piece of art, a really amazing film. I just don't wanna spoil all the fun if you didn't see it yet.

There's a fascination with the time element; and it does capture the Industrial Revolution at a particular moment with balloon transportation, trains powered by steam engines, a steamship, a large-wheeled bicycle, and gas lamps.

  Why a four-star rating? What is science fiction author, Jules Verne, saying? Arrogance (Passepartout {Cantiflas} repeats the word ""Master"" overly much), gambling (the bet about 80 days), womanizing (a frivolous joke except for one Indian princess), cultural blindness (several ancient and profound civilzations are dismissed with superficial treatment) -  that such behaviors are acceptable, even enviable.

305553,3,6300270130,"In 1956, the year that gave us such classics as The Ten Commandments, The King and I, and The Searchers, the Oscar for Best Picture went to Michael Todd's ""Around the World in 80 Days"", a three-hour spectacle that, while mildly entertaining and quaint, can in no way measure up to those other films.

Many of the ""cameo"" performances are lost on modern audiences, since the actors that briefly appear are often forgotten or unknown today, and the skimpy storyline leaves today's viewer wondering how such a thin plotline could hope to carry a supposedly Oscar-worthy film.

The many, many scenes with Mexican comedian Cantinflas drag on, slowing the film's pace (although one can possibly see how he was thought of as ""funny"" at the time), and we won't even discuss how embarrasing Shirley Maclaine is as the ""Indian"" princess. David Niven carries himself well, although he essentially plays himself.

The DVD transfer is disapppointing as well.  The Todd-AO films of the 50's have not fared well on DVD so far (Oklahoma, anyone?), and this film is no exception, its age clearly showing in the many grainy scenes and washed-out colors.

305590,4,6300270130,"This movie is a real masterpiece that makes very optimal use of the vibrant colour and abilities of the Todd-AO process to provide a visual feast to showcase the natural beauty of various locales across the world.  The camera angles for many of the scenes were simply inspired and the clarity and overall picture quality is stunningly beautiful making me a believer in the Todd-AO system.  This was and still is a good family entertainment film.  I enjoyed the transitions from stodgy old Victorian England at the start, to the Flamenco and bull-fighting scenes in Spain, the jaunt in Hong Kong although the scenes with the ostriches are clearly factually incorrect, the beautiful scenes at Yokohama with the giant Buddha statue and the exotic costumes, the wonderful Wild West scenes in San Francisco with the Native American adventures to the brilliant ingenuity on the Henrietta on the voyage back to London.

The abundance of cameos must have been a real hit with movie fans at the time although the effect will be blunted today due to the unfamiliarity of today's audiences with the stars of that time although it was nice to see Frank Sinatra and my favourite Buster Keaton in action.  Keaton, together with Charlie Chaplin were the kings of the silent era and while Chaplin was able to adapt somewhat to the advent of sound in films, sadly Keaton wasn't as lucky but like Chaplin, Keaton was a comedic genius.

The dvd is also a great treat as the sound quality that comes in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround is simply fantastic!  Excellent sound and the best for an older film that I've ever heard to date.  This shows how well a properly undertaken job at sound quality restoration can rejuvenate the older classic films if only the studios take the time and effort to do a good job.  They should use this dvd as a guide in the future as to the great potential of giving new life to older films through the use of enhanced sound quality.

The picture quality using the Todd-AO process was also very, very good and the clarity is breathtaking however there are still too many white spots in much of the film for my liking.  Hopefully with the advent of Blu-ray they should take the opportunity to really do a proper frame by frame clean up to totally remove as much as possible all these picture quality imperfections.

The special features are also very good with an excellent documentary on the life of producer Mike Todd whose life resembled that of the film's protagonist Phileous Fogg as one who is resourceful and willing to risk all to achieve his dreams.  Another entertaining extra is the television broadcast of the ""little"" party that Todd threw at the Madison Square Garden to celebrating the anniversary of the success of the film.

This dvd represents excellent value but I would like to see a better restoration job on the picture quality although again the sound quality is simply brilliant.  Having watched both the ""Giant"" dvd and this one, I am personally unsurprised that this film pipped it to the best film Oscar and in my opinion as an overall entertainment proposition, this film is indeed more deserving of the Oscar for that year.

Great film, good dvd; although you may want to wait and see if they improve even further on the picture quality for the future Blu-ray version.",1210896000,5,3303,4.7282229965156795

For some reason, maybe because of the names, Phinneas Fogg and Passepartout, I was expecting a funny film.  I was sadly disappointed on that score, although there were some somewhat amusing scenes.  Basically throughout the first disc, I felt the film's story was a threadbare line on which to hang a sort of travelogue of scenes from various countries along Phinneas' route.  The Spanish dance scene and the bull fight were unnecessarily long, as were various other episodes.  My interest grew during the second disc, but I am still glad I didn't pay full price for my set.  On the whole, I would say I found the film  mildly entertainig and it was educational on a cultural level (such as where ostriches were used to pull carts in the Orient).

305593,5,6300270130,"I am annoyed at film critics who do not like this film.  Some have questioned whether it was truly deserving of the Best Picture Oscar.  Their criticism can be reduced to the rhyming couplet, ""Because I was BORED, the film does not deserve the AWARD.""  What they forget is that the film was quite daring for its time.  Catinflas was an unusual choice for a lead; certainly he was not the classically handsome Latin Lover (think of Fernando Lamas, Ricardo Montalban, Cesar Romero). This film remains his greatest U.S. picture.  His role was mainly a comedic one but it was inspired casting.  Also, the film may seem boring to modern viewers because it was chocked full of cameos from famous actors of the 1950's who are (sadly) unknown and forgotten today.  Audiences in the 50's squealed in delight as they played a ""Where's Waldo"" game watching the picture and trying to spot their favorite actor/actress.  Today, however, audiences don't recognize many of these actors and are confused as to why the Director slows down the action to focus on some ""unknown"" face; that ""unknown"" was well known to audiences of the 1950's.  David Niven deliberately plays a comedic caricature of the ""stiff upper lip"" Britisher to such perfection that British audiences howled at their countryman's  spoof of the stereotype of the  unflappable, reserved Englishman.  Indeed, whenever I hear the phrase, ""British stiff upper lip"" I always think of Niven in this film.  Today, however, audiences don't understand Niven's stolid characterization.  Today's actors are expected to scream, yell and carry on wildly so as to be considered for Academy recognition. Moreover, the famous British reserve has fallen out of favor.  Today even  British Generals openly weep on television; everyone on Oprah weeps; the notion of unflinching steadfast reserve is gone.  Hence, modern film critics  just don't ""get"" Niven's performance.
Also, I always loved the ending of the film.  Niven thinks he has lost his wager to go around the world in eighty days but has forgotten to take into account the time zone change.  He rushes to his club and arrives precisely as the clock chimes twelve.  Had he been a second later he would have lost the bet.  It is funny and, yes, exhilarating.  The special effects in the film are nothing compared to today's digital animation but they were state of the art for the time especially the hot air balloon.
Finally, Michael Todd made a movie for the times.  Memories of the carnage of the World War; the realization of the full extent of the Nazi atrocities; the unleashing of the atomic age; the long Cold War that faced humanity---the world was in a mood for escapist fare, something frothy, fun and delightful.  So Todd gave it to them:  a cameo filled star-studded film; lavish sets; exotic locales; colorful costumes; a lush, bombastic musical score (that was turned into a hit song for Sinatra); an international cast of Catinflas, Niven and a very young and pretty Shirley MacLaine.  The film made a ton of money and deserved its Oscar for Best Picture.",1201824000,2,3063,4.908560311284047
305594,5,6300270130,"Quite often when you have movie adaptations of sprawling novels the outcome is unlikely to be be faithful to the book.  When you have a movie that spans the entire world, it is very likely that scenery is more important than story - or worse budget is more important than story.

Well, I read Jules Verne's Around the World in Eight Days a few years ago and just watched Mike Todd's Oscar Winning Adaptation.  And I was surprised on how faithful the movie was to the book.  No it is not exact but it keeps the base story line intact with only a few embellishments.

Beyond that, this film is beautifully made from the sets and costumes to the cinematography.

As for the cast, David Niven is a perferct Phileas Fogg.  This is justifiably the role he is most associated with (even more than his Oscar winning role in Seperate Tables.) Cantiflas is exceptional even though miscast (Paspartu is french)and this film made his popularity extend to many countries.  The only real miscast is Shirley Maclaine as an Indian Princess.  This was her third movie role.  At this time, her career was just taking off and so she was cast.  But she does her best.  And of course this film created the Cameo Appearance.

Intersting fact, the picture won the Golden Globe Best Picture Drama and Best Actor in a Comedy (Cantiflas)

It is pretty much a travel guide, loaded with beautiful scenery but with little or no action.  If it weren't for the antics of Cantinflas, this movie would be totally worthless.  David Niven's Phileas Fogg is a bore who does nothing but play cards and look at his watch.  Shirley MacLaine as an Indian princess?  Even the character of Detective Fixx is a bore.

305598,4,6300270130,"This was ,in its day ,an ""event movie"",a major roadshow attraction for which its producer ,the great showman Mike Todd ,pulled out all the stops .It has faded slightly with the passing of time but it is still pretty impressive and is still a movie guaranteed to entertain and divert those who watch it .

Based on the Jules Verne novel of the same name ,its protagonist is Phineas Fogg ,Verne's idea of the archetypal English gentleman - punctilious ,precise and reliable if a tad unimaginative .He sets out for his club everyday at the same time ,passes the time playing cards(very adroitly) with fellow club members  ,and returning home to his London quarters every day at the same time .It is a regime that suits his new manservant Passepartout who enjoys the prospect of a settled and predictable existence .This worthy is a trifle put out when Fogg returns early from the club and begins preparations for a voyage round the world having laid a wager with his card playing friends that he can circumnavigate the globe in 80 days utilising then new modes of transport such as railroads and steamships .
The journey is not uneventful .They cross the Alps by balloon ,India by elephant and train ,the US by train and a final dash across the pond by ship again .It is not a smooth passage -Passepartout is forced to demonstrate skills in the bullring ;there is an Indian princess to be rescued from being flung onto her late husband's funeral pyre and an attack by Native Americans on the train on which they are riding .All along the way they are tracked by the dogged Scotland Yard detective Inspector Fixx who is (erroneoulsy )under the impression that Fogg has robbed the Bank of England
The scale of the movie is impressive and the picture is always beguiling to the eyes .Niven is ideally cast as Fogg, bringing the right amount of elegant insouciance and dry delivery to the lines while suggesting the romantic hidden beneath the conventional exterior .Shirley MacLaine looks ravishing but is miscast as the Indian Princess while Cantinflas as the manservant Passepartout is a better mime than actor -he sounds uncomfortable with the language but his mime skills especially in the bullring scene are considerable .Robert Newton brings a suitably crisp edg to the obsessive Fixx while a battery of guest stars pop up to add lustre to proceedings .If I single out Trevor Howard and Robert Morley as two of the men who take up Fogg's wager it is simply because they are among my favourite performers .

Add a memorable score from Victor Young and some ravishing cinematography an you have an enjoyable movie which respects its audience far more than does the more recent Jackie Chan version which employed too much sledgehammer  comedy to be fair to Verne and showed how little many current movie makers respect the ability of modern audiences to enjoy period movies played straight",1191974400,,2886,4.789156626506024

Shirley MacLain (I love her in most everything) but what were they thinkin', a princess from India!  I know this film won an Oscar for Best Pic in 1956....It is what it is....But now I want to read the book by Jules Verne. Funny story.  We were waiting for my husband to watch the film and turned on our TV (Frankfurt, Germany) and lo and behold the 80's mini series version of Around the World was on starring Pierce Brosnan and Peter Ustinov.  My son seemed to like this version better and so did I.  It was more engaging, more human like and 6 hours long which is probably what the story needs and Mr. Brosnan brought a different feel to the role of Phinneas than Mr. Niven.  He seemed more human, perhaps!",1176249600,5,1215,4.2663755458515285

305622,2,6300270130,"When you go to the movies today, what movies you go see may force you to ask yourself ""Where's the beef?"" Today there are movies with wonderful special effects, grand stars, and no heart. Movies that are visual feasts that wow you, but leave you feeling empty on the inside. While people may consider this a recent trend with all the advances in technology, the truth is these sort of movies have been around for years, and the 1956 Best Picture winner ""Around The World In 80 Days"" is living proof of this. The story for ""Around The World In 80 Days"" takes up a whole twenty minutes of the movie. Several gentlemen hear of a bank being robbed by a thief who has fled the country, which leads to a discussion on whether or not he could successfully get away from the law. Phileas Fogg says that technology has advanced so much that if the thief were resourceful enough he could circle the world in exactly 80 days. The other gentlemen laugh and say it can't be done, so Fogg bets them 20,000 pounds that he personally could travel around the world in 80 days.

The gentlemen accept his bet, and with his assistant Passepartout sets out to circle the globe using whatever means necessary . A subplot involving a police man chasing Fogg due to a suspicion that he might have stolen some money, as well as a subplot where Fogg and Passepartout save an Indian princess (played by a young Shirley MacLaine in makeup) take place during this movie, but they are all second nature to what the movie is really about: Exotic locations and wondrous sights to see. Now, before we get into the meat (or lack therefor) of the movie, it should be noted that ""Around The World In 80 Days"" was not made with the intention of being good. Oh I'm sure producer Michael Todd (who gets his name above the title over the director) was pleased that people thought it was good, but the intention was not to make something that would be digested slowly. Michael Todd was tired of movies that were all talk and no action, and he wanted people to feel like a participant in the movie.

Therefore he created a new camera called Todd-AO, which would later be known as 70mm Cinescope. ""Around The World In 80 Days"" was not the first widescreen film (that was ""The Robe"") but made the biggest impression on the world. Ingeniously, the movie's opening (with a prolog by Edward R. Murrow) begins in the standard 35mm full screen mode, which was the shape of a TV screen. After a lengthy history of science and travel, the screen widens up to reveal the 70mm Todd-AO format. If you saw this movie in the theaters in 1956, this is where the curtain would pull open to cover the whole wall of the theater, therefor making the movie as immersive as possible. But making the picture bigger was only the beginning. Now Todd was going to make it so that audiences would be taken where they never went before. In a hot air balloon ride. To Spain to watch a bull fight. On a train where savage Indians are raiding the train, which results in a epic gun fight with the main characters fighting for their lives.

Everything that could thrill audiences were thrown into this movie, as well as a bunch of cameo appearances from famous stars such as Buster Keaton, Frank Sinatra, and Trevor Howard. In fact, this is the first movie where the term ""cameo appearance"" was coined in the first place. There are more then twenty cameo appearances in ""Around The World In 80 Days,"" though most of the people don't say anything, and where there just to get a reaction from the audience (Example: A salon player looks up from his piano long enough for us to see it's Frank Sinatra and then puts his head back down). Considering this film pioneered so many techniques we take for granted now, I can't say I completely hate this film. That said, ""Around The World In 80 Days"" is the dullest Best Picture winner you are most likely ever going to see. Not bad, dull. For all the techniques this film created, it is a shame the story itself is not more interesting.

I don't know whether or not this is the fault of the source material, the film makers, or both. Certainly science has evolved so much in the past few years, that the idea you would need 80 days to circle the globe is absurd, you could travel it in less then a few days (and that's if you're being lazy). Even at the time of this films release it was easy to travel the world in half the time of this film, so the novelty of the story is long gone. So yes, the source material doesn't provide much suspense or imagination anymore, but worse was the film makers insistence of being too much in love with their own techniques. So intent are the film makers to make the audiences feel like they are viewing the world, the movie stalls several times in the movie, becoming tedious along the way. I mentioned that the storyline takes up about twenty minutes of the time in this movie, but the movie itself is more then three hours long. So what is it you are actually watching for those three hours?

Well, everything but story. The prolog with Edward R. Murrow is a good example of how much time the film wastes. Aside from the introduction to the Todd-AO format, this introduction has a documentary feel that has nothing to do with the movie. Then there's the fact that when you consider that Fogg and Passepartout are in a race it's very odd that they spend so much time lounging around. They go to Spain and spend almost a half hour fighting a bull. A balloon flight takes fifteen minutes. Indians chase the train for twenty. Shots of the sky and sea easily amount to more then an hours worth of film. And it just goes on and on, with these characters saying absolutely nothing of interest. During a boat scene there is about ten minutes of crew members throwing wood into the steam engine to make a boat go faster. It helps that Fogg has enough money to buy boats, trains, and whatever else he needs to win the race. I'm not exactly sure how much 20,000 pounds was worth back in 1956, but it seems like the cost of the race far outweighs the reward for winning it.

This movie won five Academy Awards. It's saying something that film did not win Best Director or was even nominated for any acting awards. This is a technical film through and through. The problem with technical films winning Oscars for Best Picture is that the excitement of them wear down pretty fast. While movies like ""Ben-Hur,"" ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,"" and ""Amadeus"" were all very technical movies, they also had the story and characters to back up the movie when the visuals became outdated. ""Around The World In 80 Days"" is easily one of the worst Best Picture winners. It's not terrible, but it's painfully dull, it's so long it's maddening, and you don't ever really feel like your joining a race considering how many side trips are taken that wastes time. If there's a Best Picture winner you have to chose to not see, ""Around The World In 80 Days"" should be high on the list of considerations.

305623,5,6300270130,"Mike Todd's version of Jules Verne tale offers a refined English comedy, giant-screen travel landscapes, dazzling brilliant color, famous actors in small roles... as Phileas Fogg and his comical valet made the tour of the world beginning in England, going to Europe, the Middle East, India, and Asia...

It begins in (1872) Victorian London as the wealthy, supremely confident Phileas Fogg sets out a wager that he can traverse the globe in precisely eighty days... The other club members at the Reform Club think Fogg is a fool, and challenge his claim and wager 20,000 that he is wrong...

The snags begin almost immediately, as the true gentleman misses a train and has to travel by balloon... The wild journey takes Fogg and his new servant into a series of incredible adventures in every land they pass through...

David Niven plays the true impassive Englishman Phileas Fogg... A polished man of the world, who makes no superfluous gestures, and is never seen to be moved or agitated... A puzzling personage, who believes in progress, science, and intellectual deduction... An eccentric quiet gentleman who talks very little and lives by a precise schedule of tea, whist games, fish and chips... He lives alone in a big house, and a single domestic sufficed to serve him...

Mexican screen legend Cantinflas known as the comic genius of the Spanish-speaking world, plays Passepartout, the most faithful of domestics...

Passepartout is a multi-skilled honest Frenchman with a pleasant oval face, slender and slight, soft-mannered and serviceable...

Robert Newton plays Mr. Fix, the mysterious detective who had been dispatched from England in search of the bank robber... He is a slight-built personage, with a nervous, intelligent face, and bright eyes peering out from under eyebrows which he is incessantly twitching...

Shirley MacLaine plays the charming young Indian princess, Aouda, who was married against her will at age seven... She speaks English with great purity...

One of the main interests of the film is the various cameos played by stars of the time who give minute but exquisite characterizations:

- Finlay Currie, Mr. Fogg's usual partner at whist...

- Robert Morley, one of the directors of the Bank of England...

- John Gielgud, the dismissed servant who relates that his master wears two watches, and every available surface in his house is covered with so many clocks...

- Trevor Howard, the club's member who rejects the news that the English gentleman has robbed the Bank of England...

- Charles Boyer, the educated travel agent who proposes to the couple to travel with a hot-air balloon...

- Martine Carol, the offended lady who slaps the new butler just for saying: 'Mademoiselle!'

- Fernandel, the French coachman who was not so content with the tip...

- Gilbert Roland, the Arab who offers his ship to Marseilles just on one condition...

- Cesar Romero, the henchman who sadistically insists Passepartout must fight a bull even if he doesn't know how...

- Ronald Colman, the Railway Official who announces (No more railway!) all passengers know that they must provide means of transportation for themselves from Kholby to Allahabad...

- Cedric Hardwicke, the officer who finds happily a means of conveyance : to cross the deep jungle on an elephant!

- Charles Coburn, the Steamship Company clerk who makes the observation that the 'Carnatic' had sailed the evening before...and he doesn't expect any vessel to Yokohama one week from now...

- Peter Lorre, the smiling Japanese steward who informs Passepartout that being broke without money in Yokohama... is catastrophic!

- Glynis Johns, the sporting lady who bets with her companion on Fogg's outcome...

- George Raft, the suspicious mob who chases everyone who stands near his glamorous woman...

- Marlene Dietrich, the Barbary Coast saloon hostess who looks for a way to be free...

- Frank Sinatra, the honky-tonk pianist...

- Red Skelton, the drunken with great appetite...

- John Carradine, the insolent colonel hit by an arrow...

- Buster Keaton, the American train conductor who announces some delay...

- Andy Devine, the first mate who refuses 'Henrietta' to be burn...

- Victor McLaglen, the helmsman who is ordered ('Full steam!') to feed all the fires until the coal is exhausted...

- John Mills, the sleepy carriage driver at the delicate moment...

The other scenes that were actually outrageous and delightful are:

Passepartout scooping some snow off an alp to chill a bottle of champagne; his funny and graceful way of bullfighting; his burlesque dance with a troupe of Spanish dancers; his venture to ride an ostrich through a back-lot Hong Kong; his anxiety when he is captured by savage Sioux; his courage when he is almost burned to death with an Indian widow; his fault when he clears the 'human' pyramid; his ignorance when he breaks Hindus religious beliefs and his absurdity when he constantly tries to hit on anything in skirts...

His fellow club members hoot and bet a fortune that he cannot, so Fogg and his servant, Passepartout (the wonderful, Mexican comedian Cantinflas), set off from London to Paris and on around the world by train, ship, elephant, and even balloon, and we are treated to a magnificent spectacle. Along the way, Fogg runs afoul of Mr. Fix (Robert Newton), a detective who mistakenly tries to arrest Fogg for robbing the Bank of England. Fogg also saves the Indian Princess Aouda (Shirley MacLaine) from burning on the funeral pyre of her dead husband, and romance grows in a particularly 19th century, British manner.

305650,5,6300270130,"I recall the first time I saw this movie in the 60s. The scope of the picture, the exotic locations, and the continued cleverness of Phileas Fogg (David Niven) amazed me. Of course, time and technique have dulled the glamour of the special effects, but I still watch this movie with much of the awe of a child of the 60s and I can forgive a lot for a classic movie.

This movie is based on the classic story by Jules Verne. Phileas Fogg is playing cards with his cronies in London when the conversation turns to travel about the world. Phileas Fogg makes a statement that a person can travel around the world in 80 days. After a couple of rounds of ""my dog is bigger than your dog"" the gentlemen bet Phileas Fogg 20,000 pounds that he will not be able to travel around the world in 80 days.

Phileas Fogg had just employed a new manservant, Passepartout, played by well-known Mexican actor Cantinflas, born Mario Moreno Reyes. The character of Passepartout changes this movie from a big budget snooze fest to a humorous and entertaining fantasy. Niven's Fogg is as you might expect, very proper and serious. Passepartout is a little silly, a huge womanizer, and far less organized than Niven. However, Passepartout is adaptable and a survivor, which makes him perfect for traveling through numerous countries in 80 days.

The pair set out immediately for a journey around the world. Once in France they encounter their first transportation setback of many, and recover by taking a balloon over the mountains to Spain. In Spain we see a vignette, the first of many, starring Passepartout in the role of bull fighter. They trek by boat and eventually manage to make their way to India, where they encounter yet another transportation setback. This time they save Princess Aouda, a relatively minor role for Shirley MacLaine.

A running subplot becomes more intrusive as the journey continues. About the time that Phileas Fogg was departing for his journey the Bank of England was robbed of 50,000 pounds. Mr. Fix, played by Robert Newton, believes based on tenuous evidence that Phileas Fogg was the robber, and tries to stop him at every opportunity. Unfortunately, the Mr. Fix subplot begins to grate as the movie goes on, and I started to wish that Phileas Fogg or Passepartout would throw him overboard on one of the boat journeys.

The threesome, sometimes foursome when Mr. Fix is included, journeys to Hong Kong, where Fix tries to prevent Passepartout from getting ship tickets to Yokohoma to Phileas Fogg. The threesome are temporarily separated but reunite in Yokohoma, where Passepartout has joined a circus as an acrobat, one of his numerous talents.

They set off across the ocean in a clipper ship, of which a number of excellent views are provided if you are a clipper ship fan. The ship arrives in San Francisco, and Phileas Fogg catches a train cross the United States. There are beautiful scenes in the mountains, along with a rare scene of hundreds of bison crossing the railroad tracks. After a run-in with Native Americans, filmed in stereotypical 50s fashion, Phileas, Passepartout and Princess Aouda have missed the train. With a bit of imagination they overcome that obstacle and soon pass the train by.

Onward to New York and a ship passage back to England. Once again there is a transportation problem as they have missed the boat. They take a coastal freighter across the Atlantic, barely making the crossing. Unfortunately, Mr. Fix arrests Phileas Fogg on his return to England, apparently causing a loss of the 20,000 pound bet. However, the movie is not over, and I leave it to the viewer to follow through to the end.

Cinematic expectations have changed with time. In the era of the 50s and 60s extended views of scenery were considered fashionable because they were shown in wide screen, and most people hard rarely encountered such imagery in a movie theater. However, current audiences have lost their patience and demand a faster paced movie, when they are willing to sit through a movie focused more on plot than on action. Thus, the movie has not aged well for many audiences. The movie could probably be edited to remove some of the scenery and the extended shots that advance the plot little, but to do so also removes much of the cinematic beauty of the film.

This movie is interesting in that there are numerous actors who received either cameos or bit parts in this movie. Red Skelton, Ronald Colman, Buster Keaton, Frank Sinatra, Charles Boyer, Jos&eacute; Greco, Peter Lorre, and Marlene Dietrich appear. Though many of these names will mean little to younger audiences, most of these actors were quite famous in their era. Deep in the credits are other famous names, such as Keye Luke, who was a regular on the 70s series ""Kung Fu,"" and Richard Loo, who appeared in a number of movies, including ""The Sand Pebbles"" and ""The Man with the Golden Gun."" This short list is far from inclusive, as there are many more famous names in the list of credits.

There have been a couple of attempts to remake this movie, and both have succeeded only in proving that the original endures as the best of the bunch. Even with its flaws, this movie is a classic, and for those with a mind to the era in which it was made, and have the patience to watch the movie even when the focus is on panoramas, you will find there are rewards in this film.",1110758400,3,5375,4.720682302771855
305651,3,6300270130,"This review is for the new two disc DVD release of Around the World in 80 Days.

The picture was a huge gamble for producer Mike Todd both financially and personally but it is one that paid off handsomely in spades. It won many,many accolades including the best picture OSCAR for 1956(five total).

It is a veritable who's who of film actors from its lead characters of David Niven and Cantinflas to Noel Coward,Ralph Richardson,Ronald Coleman,Evelyn Keyes,John Carradine,Reginald Denny,Marlene Dietrich,George Raft,Victor McLaughlin,Peter Lorre,Buster Keaton(who looks very much at home as a conductor on a train in the old west being pulled by a locomotive of similar style as the 'General'),and many,many more.

David Niven is a very Victorian,very stalwart and stiff-upper-lip Englishman who, immediately after taking on a new ""man"" played by famous Mexican/Latin American film star Cantinflas,decides to take a bet on that he can 'round the world in less than 80 days and the film takes us on that trip with him.

Along the way we see some very spectacular locations and scenery as the cinemetography is top rate throughout.

The film opens interestingly enough by Edward R.Murrows who introduces us to a replay of George Melies' 1902 film ""A Trip to the Moon""(almost complete) then we get to see earth from the camera of a rocket which was sent up especially by Todd for use in this picture. This then all segues into the beginning of the ""actual"" picture.

The picture I feel has lost a little of the punch it had back in 1956. It is a bit uneven throughout as it has its' weak moments(The Spanish dancing sequence)and strong moments(the rescue of the princess in India).

Also as uneven as the film plays so is the film transfer which could/should have been done MUCH better than it was. The print itself is quite good and clear but there are many places throughout that need ""cleaning"" of the light streaks and blotches that appear much too often. There are also some scenes with light non-moving dots in them but whether this is a camera lens problem that is permamently on the film or a print/negative problem(which in either scenario could easily be removed digiatlly)is unknown.

In conclusion this is the best transfer of this movie to date onto DVD.The set is filled with many wonderful features including a great bio of the producer and many behind the scenes look at the making of the film.

Although an uneven picture clocking in at about 180 minutes it still manages to satisfy. The cinemtography never fails to impress and it is well supported throughout by a cornocopia of fine actors.",1110585600,3,2606,4.877828054298643

305653,5,6300270130,"AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS is more a triumph of spectacle than of storytelling, with an extraordinary backstory of a master entrepreneur's decade-long dream to create the biggest, most extravagant entertainment ever made. That the film was ever produced at all was miraculous; that it succeeded so well (earning the ""Best Picture"" Academy Award, along with a raftload of other prizes), and remains the most enjoyable version of Verne's novel (far superior to the Pierce Brosnan and Jackie Chan remakes) is a living testament to it's nearly forgotten guiding spirit, Michael Todd.

The film itself is basically a series of 'set pieces' (most involving the brilliant Mexican comedian, Cantinflas, and a wide variety of guest stars, appearing in 'cameos', to use the term coined by Todd), built around the framework of an aristocrat's wager that, using available transportation, he could circumnavigate the globe in 80 days. While David Niven is perfect as the supercilious Phileas Fogg, and Robert Newton is at his hammy best as detective Mr. Fix, it is Cantinflas, as Passepartout, manservant and sweet Everyman, who steals the movie.

While the years has lessened the novelty of many of the cameos, as performers have faded from memory, a few legendary actors still bring a smile, in their brief appearances (particularly an over-long but still amusing barroom sequence with Marlene Dietrich, George Raft, Red Skelton, and, as a 'capper', Frank Sinatra).

Included as 'extras' offered in the two-disc set are a revealing, occasionally tongue-in-cheek 1968 biography, ""Around the World of Mike Todd"", featuring fascinating and funny insights by his widow, Elizabeth Taylor, a clean-shaven, cape-draped Orson Welles, and many others; ""Playhouse 90: Around the World in 90 Minutes"", a 'live' look at the ultimately disastrous first anniversary 80 DAYS party at Madison Square Garden, with Garry Moore offering funny vignettes featuring Todd, himself (quite gifted at comedy!), and 'on scene' legendary commentators Walter Cronkite and Jim McKay (long before ""Wide World of Sports""); Todd and Taylor, backstage after winning the ""Best Picture"" Oscar; and MUCH more.

Bravo to Warner Home Video for releasing a new, remastered DVD edition of the film, and including a treasure trove of special features about the film, and the irrepressible Michael Todd!",1095206400,74,2350,5.360433604336043
305654,4,6300270130,"An eagerly awaited and long overdue restoration of the movie that won the Oscar as the best film of 1956. That was a pretty good year for movies and the competition was intense. But Around The World In 80 Days was entertainment in capital letters, although younger members of modern audiences might wonder what all the fuss was about.

The film certainly looks and sounds wonderful in this special edition DVD. If you are going to see it, this is the way. The extras are not overly exciting - a bit disappointing really. The most interesting is probably the complete version of Melies' Trip To The Moon (not certain what that has to do with Around The World other than also being based on Jules Verne) but that gets to be heavy going after a while.

Around The World In 80 Days was, of course, the brainchild and crowning glory of super showman Mike Todd. By all accounts, getting the film made and financed was not easy and production occasionally ground to a halt while more funding was secured. That probably accounts for the slight unevenness and occasional rough edges. Some scenes seem almost unfinished and the narrative jumps over large sections of geography. Maybe it's just time restrictions or sloppy editing, but the film does have an uncertain pace unusual for productions on this scale. And the camera doesn't linger on quite as many exotic landscapes as you might expect.

But Todd's biggest and best gimmick for the film was the invention of the cameo role for big name stars. Fifty or so well known personalities pop up all along the route, which provided the extra fun of spotting them and putting the correct name to the face (""Is that Jack Oakie?"" ""No, that's Jack Oakie."" ""Mom, who's Jack Oakie?"") Some have larger bits than others - Jose Greco gets a superb solo spot, Peter Lorre is Peter Lorre, Noel Coward and John Gielgud make a great double act). A few, like Frank Sinatra, never utter a word - they're just there. But they provide a real sense of class to the affair. Sadly, quite a few of them will now go unrecognized by younger viewers.

The four main stars are a curious mix. Mexican comedian Catinflas is quite good as Passepartout, even if his accent is a little too thick at times. His clowning livens up many scenes, especially in an extended Spanish bullring sequence. Robert Newton plays Detective Fixx like a distant cousin of Long John Silver. A rather subdued Shirley MacLaine seems a strange choice to play an Indian princess. And David Niven seems to play Phileas Fogg just a trifle too straight. Not even a hint of a tongue in cheek.

The later television version of Around The World with Pierce Brosnan makes an interesting comparison and is enjoyable in its own right - even an improvement in some areas. The more recent film with Jackie Chan is best forgotten. It is the 1956 movie that will always be remembered and ultimately be most entertaining. And on this DVD, it is better than ever.",1094515200,12,2937,4.651252408477842

Perelman, John Farrow (who was scheduled to direct but quickly withdrew after squabbles with Todd) and James Poe, cinematographer Lionel Lindon, associate producer William Cameron Menzies (who'd created the visual style for ""Gone With the Wind"") and the great film composer Victor Young. Lindon's gorgeous photography and Young's memorable score are pretty much the elements that solidify the film and keep it from flying to pieces. Even so, ""80 Days"" still little more than a travelogue (meant to show off Todd's Todd-AO process) set to music; the barest thread of a storyline (from Jules Verne) keeps it going. But somehow it never flags - there's always a surprise around every corner and two or three new stars in every scene. Virtually everyone in the picture is long dead (only MacLaine, John Mills and Glynis Johns survive by my 2004 count), and younger viewers won't recognize half the former film greats, but it's still enormous fun. And it looks and sounds surprising good. There were rumors that both that original Todd-AO version (shot at 30 frames per second) and CinemaScope version (shot at 24) were beyond restoration. But the DVD, made from the Todd-AO roadshow version) look very good - though the color is a touch more garish than I remembered. The new 5.1 stereo sound mix is also first rate - most magnetic tracks this old are powder now. The 179-minute film is spread over two discs and there are a lot of extras. A documentary on Todd (who wooed and wed Elizabeth Taylor while riding the ""80 Days"" crest) is interesting, but an edited version of a live, 90-minute CBS TV broadcast of the lavish party for 18,000 Todd threw marking the film's first anniversary shows the huckster at his self-inflated worst. If you think TV news promotion  and show-biz hype are something new, watch Walter Cronkite and his news boys prostituting themselves here. A few months after the party, Todd died in a plane crash, leaving ""80 Days"" as his movie memorial.",1093478400,2,2736,4.883870967741935

This film was made by the late Michael Todd, one of Elizabeth Taylor's many husbands, who attracted many of the star-studded cast by coining the phrase (now widely used) ""cameo appearance.""  Stars of such lofty reputations would almost certainly not have agreed to ""bit"" parts, but ""cameo"" had a much more palatable ring to it.  And this one does, indeed, have a cast of stars.

The late David Niven, one of filmdom's truly outstanding great actors with unmatched panache, has the starring role, as Phineas Fogg, an eccentric Englishman who wagers that he can circumnavigate the globe in only eighty days, to the disbelief and even derision of other members of his exclusive London club.

Accompanying him is his personal servant, Passepartout (Cantinflas, playing his first English speaking role), whom hw has just hired that very day.  The movie is excellent in its depiction of various parts of the world that the pair experience, including 19th century America.

The plot is complicated when a British detective, Mr. Fix (Robert Newton), suspects Fogg of robbing the Bank of England and dogs his tail throughout.

This is a fine film, made in 1957 originally, at great expense and with a hugely talented staff.  Truly an extravaganza, very entertaining.  It was the ""Picture of the Year"" when it was released.  Very entertaining.

305681,5,6300270130,"Immensely refreshing movie that brings out the best adventure of the human spirit.  Phileas Fogg the eccentric multi-millionaire makes a beat with the members with an elite all British Club whose members include a banker from the bank of England that he can travel around the world in 80 days accompanied by his servant Cantinflas.  The Club starts placing beats against Fogg immediately and Fogg's deductions about a bank robbery will make him a suspect.
Fogg instructs Cantinflas too carry the bag containing an enormous quantity of new British notes and charges him to watch the bag at all times.  When Fogg arrives at the travel agency and discovers an avalanche has blocked travel by railway, he begins searching for a new solution and upon discovering an alternate solution Fogg purchases a hot air balloon.  Fogg and Cantinflas sail over the Alps with Cantinflas grab snow from a peak too chill their Champaign as they celebrate their ingenuity.  Fogg will not be deterred from keeping on schedule by providing generous bonus for increased performance by participates along the journey.
Cantinflas is an important element to the movie; as in the scene in Spain where his spontaneous burst of enthusiastic dancing resulted in an invitation too participate in a bullfight.  Cantinflas performed magnificently in the bullfight and eventually tames the bull, a tribute too his magnificently skill and was carried on the shoulders of the people as a hero. Because of Cantinflas skill Fogg is permitted usage of the Sultan's ship for passage to India.
In India, Cantinflas mischievously taunts a Braham bull mistaking him as a nuisance and instead draws the wrath of the community as religious violation of a religious symbol and a mob chase after Cantinflas and escapes from them out of breath as he leaps onto a train containing the impatient Fogg and the group is on route too Hong Kong.
Unfortunately, the group discovers the rail road tracks leading to Hong Kong has not been finished and the group must travel the last 50 miles by Elephant and during this time Cantinflas devises and executes the rescues of the beautiful Princess Aouda, who later falls in love with Fogg and becomes his wife.  In Hong Kong Cantinflas becomes separated from Fogg as the inspector tricks him into drinking a knockout drink and Cantinflas wakens too find himself on a ship to Yokohama without Fogg and penniless.
Japan without any money will not treat Cantinflas well and once in Japan without money he can't purchase food.  The first place Cantinflas visits after arriving Japan is a large Buddha statue and where he receives an apple and praises Buddha for the generosity, yet his stomach is still empty, so Cantinflas joins the circus too make some money for food when suddenly Fogg arrives during the performance and the group departs in a disaster for the circus.
The group catches a ship for San Francisco arriving during an election (look for Red Skeleton and Frank Sinatra).  Cantinflas prepares for the ""Wild West"" and hostile Indians by purchasing weapons and eventually appear dressed like gun fighter, but this doesn't prevent his capture by the Sue Indians, who plan on burning him. Fogg rescues Cantinflas leading a Calvary charge and this delay causes them too miss the train so they innovate and create a wind powered rail car helping them finish the journey across the Transamerica rail.
The group is running behind schedule and have missed the ship to England so they divert travel plans and acquire a steam ship in Argentina managing to cross the ocean by using all burnable items to power the steam ship.  Once back on English soil, Fogg is detained as a Bank robbery and later released as the real thieve has been apprehended.  Fogg accepts the princesses Auoda hand in marriage and insist on Cantinflas acquire the preacher for the marriage and as Cantinflas retrieves the preacher, he realizes that they have arrived on Saturday not Sunday because they have travel east saving a day.  Fogg arrives punctually and receives 20,000 pounds for his travels.",1086652800,6,4064,4.9602941176470585
305682,5,6300270130,"In this age of big-budget CGI special effects, a 1956 movie with this kind of scope and grandeur is all the more astonishing.  This is the movie I longed to watch when I first saw the chopped-up, washed-out ""Around the World in 80 Days"" on VHS years ago.  BRAVO on this fantastic DVD!!!!  The picture quality is stunning, the colors are vibrant, the widescreen presentation is perfect, and the story is more charming than ever.
I was drawn to this movie not as a fan of 1950's epics (although I love them) but as an avid fan of Jules Verne.  This is quite possibly the only screen version that is loyal to Verne's inspired masterpiece of comedy.  With over 40 cameos by such stars as Buster Keaton, Frank Sinatra, Red Skelton, and Peter Lorre, Michael Todd's one and only film is a masterpiece in its own right.  It is more about star power, breathtaking cinematography, and sharp, witty dialogue than about story, and it is all these elements that make the film work so well.  The flamenco dance in the Spanish tavern is alone worth the price of the DVD - it is one of the most gorgeous scenes ever shot on film.
But David Niven, Robert Newton, and Shirley MacLaine aside, the real star of this film is the charming and phenomenally talented Cantinflas, the Mexican comedian who at the time was the highest paid entertainer in the world.  And with good reason!  In his first English-speaking role, Cantinflas steals the show with a brilliant performance.
Fans of Jules Verne will be tickled pink at the very faithful adaptation (with only very minor changes that play to the particular strengths of Cantinflas himself - even Jules Verne would love that bullfighting scene!), and fans of 50's epics will be enthralled with the scope of this monumental achievement.  This is one of those films that should be much better known than it is, because it is simply one of the finest movies ever made.
Thanks to Warner Brothers for FINALLY seeing this movie's great potential and restoring it to the presentation it deserves.  Fantastic job.",1085616000,9,2034,4.701408450704226
305683,5,6300270130,"First of all, ""Around the World in 80 Days"" is one of the best of the 1950-1960's grand epics. It may not have the character depth of Giant or the scale of The Ten Commandments, but it's still one heck of a fun movie.
Mike Todd set out to make 3 hours of crowd-pleasing entertainment and he reached his goal, ten-fold (literally... the $6,000,000 film earned over 4 times its cost at the box office). The cast is wonderful (it's definately Cantinflas' show, though) and the Oscar winning cinematography is breathtaking. Also, one of the best musical scores (also an Oscar winner) and a witty screenplay (Oscar winner) make it a real joy to see.
Sadly, for the last 18 years, the only version on home video has been a pan & scan one. ""80 Days"" was shot in the Todd-AO 70mm format, so the crisp, ultra-detailed, and wide image is totally mangled in that format. It doesn't help that the P&S tape also used a mono track rather than the full stereophonic surround sound that Todd-AO (and even many general release 35mm prints) offered.
Warner Home Video's DVD of the film is nothing short of a triumph. The film's original negative has been in awful condition since the 1950's (not Warner's fault, mind you), thus making a watchable print is more or less impossible. Thankfully, Warner has remastered ""80 Days"" from scratch. The result is a stunning 2.20:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer, with the Todd-AO mix adapted to Dolby Digital 5.1 (448 kbs, too!) While the image occasionally has gooey splices and some specks on the image, the film has a level of crispness and color vibrancy that rivals 1940's Technicolor films. The 5.1 track is wonderful and keeps a lot of the directional sound of 6-track magnetic sound from 70mm presentation.
What is really amazing is that Warner managed to make one of the most perfect digital transfers of a film, ever. Not one hint of edge enhancement pops up, no pixelation, no macroblocking. While the film source isn't perfect, Warner didn't add any sort of imperfections when adapting the 65mm film to NTSC video. The switch to 448 kbs (Warner usually uses a lower bitrate for 5.1 audio) gives the audio a certain warmth that is in line with the ultra-high fidelity of 6-track mag sound.
The extras are great, too. The Robert Osborne intros, outtakes, Brian Sibley commentary, original ""Trip to the Moon"" short, and roadshow program book (on DVD-ROM) makes this an excellent presentation of a Best Picture Oscar winner.
Whether you're collecting the Best Picture winners, a fan of the classic 1950's epics, or just looking for a fun movie to watch, Around the World in 80 Days is worth a purchase. ""80 Days"" hasn't lost its luster due to age, it's because of poor presentation. Now that Warner Bros. has released the film in widescreen, people can now discover what is one of the most underrated and neglected films.",1085356800,237,2851,4.761616161616161
305684,5,6300270130,"I have been waiting for years for Warner Brothers to release ""Around the World in 80 Days"" in its original widescreen splendor.  For the DVD edition, the powers-that-be wisely decided to remaster and enhance the roadshow version, which restores one scene showing Cantinflas's attempts to escape the ""redskins"" chasing him.  The picture and sound is quite good, certainly better than any print I have seen on TV in recent memory.  Although a few minor scratches and pit marks remain on this restored print, the overall look, especially on a widescreen television, is awesome.
I have read that this film is not as good as its reputation.  One must remember the social atmosphere of the world this movie was released into.  Nowadays, with large TV's and the internet, along with the ability to jet to anywhere in the world in the blink of an eye, a film like this may appear quaint and antique.  But in 1956, when ""Around the World"" was first released, television wasn't even in color, much less HDTV widescreen.  The only way to see color images of, say India, was to read National Geographic.  Before 1956, movie studios ""made magic"" on the backlot, with sets constructed to look like ""Casablanca"".  The film's producer, Mike Todd, took his cameras to the actual locations, and for the first time in film history.  It's little wonder ""Around the World in 80 Days"" was such a blockbuster hit.
It will be interesting to see if the new Jackie Chan ""Around the World in 80 Days"" can even come close to matching Mike Todd's achievement.",1085011200,12,1530,4.783269961977187
305685,4,6300270130,"""Around The World in 80 Days"" is producer, Mike Todd's lasting tribute to divine decadence circa 1950's film making. Keeping in mind that the decade produced one lavish, eye popping spectacle after the next in an attempt to win audience away from television, ""Around the World in 80 Days"" is a star-studded, over produced and overblown retelling of the classic story by visionary author, Jules Verne.  Having stated the obvious, this film is also a lot of fun to watch. The story - in brief - concerns a bet made by Phileus Fogg (David Niven)to members of his men's club, that he can circle the world in 80 days and be back in England in time to collect his handsome wager. On this occasion, Fogg is ably aided by his man servant, Passepartout (Cantinflas)to whom Fogg entrusts most of the seemingly benign duties on their journey. Every one from famed Flamango dancer, Jose Greco, to sultry Marlene Dietrich make cameo appearances, which is part of the fun of this gigantic travel log with an attitude.  Shirley McClaine plays a key role as an Arabian princess, whom Fogg befriends and brings back with him to England. Over all, good humor, great fun - if a bit stuffy at times - and carried off with overwhelmingly ""splendiferous"" showmanship.
THE TRANSFER: In a word - marvelous. ""Around the World In 80 Days"" was filmed in Mike Todd's patented Todd-AO widescreen format. Superior to Cinemascope in just about every way, novices to the process may find the fish eye warping of vertical and horizontal lines a bit problematic to watch but this is as Todd envisioned the film to be seen. Warner Brothers gives us a near pristine print. After some unstable color during the film's overly lengthy introduction (delivered by no less of an M.C. narrator than Edward R. Murrow), and a rather faded montage of a rocket ship blasting into space, the rest of the film exhibits a stunningly pristine, vibrant and solid color scheme that is in keeping with the high resolution of the Todd-AO film process. Colors are rich, well defined and nicely balanced. Shadow, black and contrast levels are magnificently rendered. Several outdoor scenes exhibit a slightly soft characteristic, but this too is in keeping with the original photography.  Edge enhancement is rarely present. Pixelization and shimmering of fine details is never an issue. The audio is remixed to 5.1 and offers a marvelous spread - particularly in the music. Dialogue is directionalized in several scenes to good advantage. Truly, this is one heck of a good visual presentation from Warner and it is to be commended on every level.
EXTRAS: The film is divided into two parts across two discs, but, as the original roadshow engagement had an intermission, this break is forgiveable. Both discs contain a very thorough and engaging audio commentary.  As well, on disc one we get to see George Melies' A Trip To the Moon (also based on a Jules Verne novel) in its full and uncropped version. The film elements have dated badly but over all, the image quality on this short film is to be expected. On disc two we get several extra features including an hour long documentary on Mike Todd that was produced in 1968 and narrated by Orson Welles. The color balancing on this documentary is POOR, with orange flesh tones and a considerable amount of grain, dirt and scratches throughout. We also get some edited clips from Playhouse 90 and the Academy Award ceremonies that are in poor condition but interesting to view from a historical perspective nevertheless.
BOTTOM LINE: ""Around The World in 80 Days"" is the sort of grandiose production that became a main staple of the 1950s. It's loaded with kitsch, glamor, exotic locations and appearances by nearly every major star of the day. Although one could argue there were far more deserving candidates for the BEST PICTURE OSCAR, this film continues to live up to all the hype one has come to hear over the years, regarding its lengthy and lavish production. Warner's 2 disc special edition should be on everybody's wish list!",1084838400,11,4029,4.843251088534108

Fogg bets his snooty London club that he can travel around the world in eighty days, and sets off immediately with his new servant Passepartout (played by Cantinflas, the Charlie Chaplin of Mexico.) In beautiful travelogue photography we follow the pair through many adventures in Spain, India (where they rescue an Indian princess, played by Shirley McClean, which may seem absurd today but heck it was made in the fifties), Japan, and the wild west of America.

305719,5,6300270130,"If you're looking for a steely-eyed, completely objective review of Mike Todd's 1956 blockbuster ""Around the World in 80 Days,"" don't look here!  As a very unsophisticated boy of 12 I saw this film in its first release, and though I'm long past being an innocent 12-year-old, its spell over me has never faded.  I loved the story, and I thought the ""twist"" at the ending was wonderfully clever (it still is!), but in 1957 it was the technical aspects of this movie that really blew me away--it was the first movie I ever saw in a super-wide-screen format, and the first I ever heard that was in stereophonic sound.  Today, however, as I see ATWIED through adult eyes, the acting and the production values are what make it a great film for me.

The story is about Phileas Fogg (David Niven), a wealthy Englishman of compulsively punctual habits who wagers a staggering sum that he can complete a journey around the world in 80 days--quite a feat for 1872.  Accompanied by his somewhat seedy gentleman's gentleman Passepartout (Cantinflas), Fogg sets off on his journey, unaware that Scotland Yard suspects him of masterminding a recent robbery of the Bank of England.  Fueled by the bumbling and thick-headed Inspector Fixx (portrayed by Robert Newton, who died shortly after this film was completed), this subplot helps move the action along very smartly.

For movie buffs, the best feature of this film is the profusion of cameo roles, often delightfully tongue-in-cheek, that punctuates the action.  (In fact, the term ""cameo role"" originated with this movie!)  In some films--""The Longest Day"" comes immediately to mind--cameo roles are often hokey, and an annoying distraction.  In this one, they work beautifully because the casting is so good:  Evelyn Keyes as a snooty Parisian girl, John Carradine as a blustering denizen of the American West, George Raft as a sinister saloon owner--every role is perfectly filled.  And if you're not the type of viewer who immediately recognizes classic film actors at first glimpse, don't worry about it.  You won't miss a thing.  The good-natured cameos are so skillfully worked into the fabric of the film that they never intrude upon the plot.

Is ""Around the World in 80 Days"" flawless?  Of course not.  Parts of it, like the opening monologue by famous, cigarette-in-hand newscaster Edward R. Murrow, are certainly dated--but in a way, this gosh-gee-whiz segment showing a relatively tiny rocket being fired into the stratosphere is a nostalgic reminder of what life was like mere days before the first artificial satellite orbited a planet that would never be the same again.

Now, after a seemingly endless wait, nostalgia buffs can see this wonderfully good-natured film on DVD.  The restoration is virtually flawless (there are a few places where the print could have been cleaned up a bit), but compared with the faded VHS copies that have been floating around for years, this release of ATWIED is absolutely stunning, its color and sound brilliantly restored, and well worth the modest investment to obtain it.  The special added features are generally worthwhile, too.  Highly recommended!",1063670400,17,3145,5.044487427466151

If you read Jules Verne's book, you would think making a movie of it would be a no-brainer. Unfortunately, this movie was made in just that style. Anyway, in memory of Jules Verne, and because I thought it must have won 5 Oscars for some reason, I just had to see what happened next, and it did begin to pick up after they arrived in India.

Regarding that comment about the color.  I looked it up and this film is in Technicolor and this color process almost always preserves it's original vibrancy.  My guess is that he either got a bad tape or the tape transfer was not good.  A DVD should look really good, especially on a HDTV.  Come on Warner, when can we have a proper DVD of this film?",1035417600,2,529,4.127450980392157
305725,5,6300270130,"There's a famous old saying to the effect that ""It's a difference of opinion that makes horse races.""  Present-day critics often look askance at ""Around the World...,"" yet when it came out, it earned the plaudits of almost every critic then in existence, and was nominated for eight Oscars (including Best Director), winning five, including Best Picture.  This may simply indicate a change in movie tastes on the part of critics over nearly 40 years, but I still consider it to be one of the most purely enjoyable examples of family viewing yet to appear on video.
Of course, everyone knows the basic premise of the film: Phileas Fogg (Niven), ""the most punctual man alive,"" bets a group of fellow clubmen (staking his entire fortune) that he can circle the world in 80 days, and then, accompanied by his valet Passepartout (Cantinflas in his first U. S. film), sets out to do just that, along the way rescuing an English-educated Parsee girl, Aouda (MacLaine), from forced suttee and attracting the attention of Scotland Yard's Insp. Fix (Newton in his final role), who is convinced he is the man who robbed the Bank of England on the day before his departure.  This was the first and last film produced by Mike Todd (then married to Elizabeth Taylor), who was killed two years later, and for a first effort--indeed, for any effort!--it's astounding.  Todd believed in going all out, and he surrounded himself with the best talent he could find, even going so far as to cast major film figures in minor parts, inventing along the way the now-familiar term ""cameo role.""  The film was actually shot in large part on location, requiring a huge crew and many cast members to travel untold thousands of miles and using what was literally ""a cast of thousands.""  (Of all the exterior scenes, only two were observably shot on indoor sets.)  To be sure, it loses something through translation to the small screen, but the scenery is still beautiful and the actors still strut their stuff to good effect.
In a movie of this length, pacing is everything, and the pace of ""Around the World..."" is consistent and steady.  True, it's a little slow getting started, as it introduces Fogg and his Club, but after a few minutes it cuts to Passepartout on a ""pennyfarthing"" bicycle, and from then on there's always something going on or something interesting to look at: Cantinflas's bullfight in Spain, the balloon trip over the French countryside, the drugging of Passepartout in Hong Kong, the Japanese circus, and the stripping at sea of the sidewheeler Henrietta, to say nothing of the mere presence of Cantinflas, who adds a touch of comic lightness to what might otherwise be a rather taut film; the costumes, the vehicles, and the incidental characters, especially Sir Cedric Hardwicke as Gen. Sir Francis Cromarty, Red Skelton as the gluttonous drunk in San Francisco, John Carradine as Col. Proctor, and Joe E. Brown as the Fort Kearney stationmaster.  The credits at the end are difficult to read unless you have a giant-screen TV, though the imaginitive treatment is worth sitting through.  And viewers of all ages will enjoy the sheer suspense of ""What-will-happen-next?""--which is, of course, what makes a story a story.  The more penetrating viewer may also find it interesting to watch how Fogg develops: though he maintains almost to the end that he is a man of the most precise habits and has no human warmth to speak of, there are cracks in his armor--a moment's appreciation of a sunset over the Arabian Sea, his compassionate resolve to rescue Aouda (and his nervous lick of the lips when she seems unsaveable), his reassuring pats to Passepartout's shoulder as their journey passes midpoint and things pile up in their path.  You will probably prefer to fast-forward through the prologue, featuring Edward R. Murrow giving an introductory talk, but once the movie itself gets under way, S. J. Perelman's inspired mix of action, humor, and suspense should hold everyone's interest.
After all, the proof of the pudding is in the eating.  This video has been in my collection for over 15 years (it was one of the first I acquired after buying my first VCR), and in that time, even with literally hundreds of other films in competition, I've taken time to run it a total of eight times to date--and enjoyed it just as much each time as I did when I first saw it.  Modern critics to the contrary, I maintain that it well deserves a place in the pantheon of classics--and a look by families seeking simple enjoyment for all ages.",1035331200,6,4530,4.813384813384813
