8671214,5,B00MAS03CU,"I really liked this one, though I shouldn't admit it because enjoying something this emotional will destroy my tough, unsentimental reputation if it gets about. Although I have seen reviews pointing out the cultural miscues between the characters, I don't think there is any intention of being culturally insensitive - I think the film strives to point out how difficult it is to understand another culture or the people who have grown up within its influence. I believe the filmmakers are encouraging viewers to be adventurous and curious enough to try to understand and to try to pass beyond fantasies and imagination to see how people really live in all their differences - and maybe to adopt some of the good elements in place of ineffective elements of our own ways. Quite well done in spite of the tear-jerker bits - well acted, well-written, humorous, and touching.",1413331200,2,872,4.938775510204081
