2927173,5,B000UYX4RM,"I actually bumped into this box set this weekend. I like how they did the box design. They kept the two dvds in their original clamshells, but I only opened the 2nd one and didn't find any inserts (not sure if all are like that or if the separate dvd does have promotional materials).

The box set is definitely worth getting if you want to continue the widescreen experience in the second part.

The pacing of the story seems to be bit slower in some areas, and the sound isn't as fantastic as the first part. I just felt the music, pacing and sound was excellent especially in that hospital chase in the 1st one.

There was a change in cast, as Yurine is done by another voice actress, but although noticeable, she was still an excellent replacement. In a lot of ways I find the dub surpasses the original Japanese voice acting. For example in the first DVD I really love how they changed one of the characters with a creepy electronic voice.

You will get backstory into Otaha which is great, in the second DVD you'll learn more of what a Karas is. I'm very much hoping for a spinoff due to the potential of the series.

I think there are some drawbacks in the second part, such as the animation quality seemed to have dropped a bit. Example is when characters are doing attacks it looked like they forgot to render some backgrounds as they would in the first dvd.

I found the conclusion very fitting, and I'm definitely not upset at the ending. Otaha is an extremely interesting character.

I kinda wished they'd have more interaction with other characters like Nue and the Snail guy in the second part, but I was amused by the female character that accompanies the other Yurine.

I had thought about knocking this down a star, but in all honesty I find that the series is just an excellent addition to add to anyone's collection. The drawbacks are *extremely* minor. I found that their approach on mixing 3d with 2d elements of anime was just refreshing, they didn't bother making everything realistic and I found it worked just right, unlike the Final Fantasy Advent movie where it started looking cartoonish when they went through all the trouble of making something realistic and then added in cartoony moves on the characters.

Karas is an excellent animation to show to people at the very least in technical aspects that won't bore people like Ghost in the Shell may.",1193529600,24,2378,4.576470588235294
2927174,5,B000UYX4RM,"couldn't beat the price for these two, already had the 1st one, Dark Prophecy, and hadn't seen the second one, so I went ahead and purchased, happy I did, although Revelation wasn't as good IMHO (In My Honest Opinion)",1365033600,,217,4.589743589743589
2927175,2,B000UYX4RM,"If you have time to kill............ you can watch this and realize the story is boring, I know I know could I be more vague. The answer is yes. Jult Warfell",1336867200,,157,4.096774193548387
2927176,5,B000UYX4RM,"I own both movies and watched them both seprately as in around two - three years apart mostly waiting for Karas: the Revelation to be released in the U.S.

The first one Karas: Prophecy caught my eye when I seen it on one of the ""Movie Channels"" I had on Cable.  I was amazed by the stunning Graphics even during fight sceans it was visualy stunning and alot of detail went into the graphics. The story though rather dark was intresting and kept me intrested well into the end that left on a huge clif hanger, But that odviously was to lead to another Karas Movie.

The Second one Karas: The Revelation Continued the story almost exactly where the first let off and continued the Awe insipring graphics and even deeper story. There was alot more action and a very fitting ending.

The voice acting in both Films was not the best but it did not take away from the story.

I do think they intended on making a trilogy out of this but due to some reason or another was only able to make the two films.

These are both Action/Super Natural Anime movies and both have lots of cool fight sceans, Lots of blood, Some brief nudity, and some very adult Language so Pick this up for the Adult anime lovers b/c you sure won't be disapointed with either film.",1324944000,,1247,4.353448275862069
2927177,5,B000UYX4RM,"Being an anime enthusiast, this one really pulls all strings. The story alone is a bit confusing in The Revelation, but a great price for some really awesome sequences. Highly recommended for those whom stray from the bubblegum pop serials and are in tune for something a bit darker. Great style and fluid storytelling. 2 metal-licks! \M/ \M/",1324857600,,342,4.913793103448276
2927178,5,B000UYX4RM,This was a great collection of OVAs. I have never heard of this Anime before this and I enjoyed it.,1324598400,,99,4.0
2927179,3,B000UYX4RM,If you like dark action bloody animes then this set of DVDs is a must buy. The story itself is a little confusing so I suggest you read a synopsis or summary of the plot beforehand otherwise you will get confused. The DVDs come in two separate cases and also in a DVD box case. The corner of the box was a little beat up when I got it but the DVDs were ok. Not for the squeamish type anime lover,1319414400,,395,3.888888888888889
2927180,3,B000UYX4RM,"It was pretty entertaining, but all of part one is sort of just a ""whaaa?"" trip. Then part two comes along and mostly everthing is explained. It was pretty entertaining but the CGI sucked sometimes and the fact that it wasn't explained until 2 hours in was a little crappy. I would suggest that someone borrows this from a friend before they buy it. It's worth seeing though.",1312156800,,375,4.529411764705882
2927181,2,B000UYX4RM,"Undeniably beautiful, the artistry cannot be faulted.  These are visually stunning movies with exquisitely (and sometimes grotesquely) rendered images.  However, as dazzling as the artwork is, the story leaves much to be desired.  At all times purposely obscure, it is more than just a little difficult to follow.  What begins as simply bewildering soon becomes annoying, a mindless tease for reasons unknown.  What made this even worse was when the story was finally revealed it was so simplistic in nature that a mere sentence could sum it up: making this much ado about absolutely nothing.  This is storytelling at its worse; barely above mindless rambling.
The story: in a city where demons are forgotten by humans, a battle ensues to teach the humans a lesson and to bring an oppressor to power over all.  Yeah, that's pretty much it, good against evil.  No surprise who wins.

Top marks for looks, zero for being incomprehensible.  Won't put myself through another sitting, not a keeper.",1309910400,,993,5.03680981595092
2927182,4,B000UYX4RM,"Blink, and you'll become confused.  I have watched both DVDs twice to see that the plot does, in fact, make sense.  Some quick Googling explains some of the Japanese-specific symbolism and obscure plot points.  For me, ""Karas"" has been worth the extra effort; your mileage may vary.

If you get this two-DVD set, make sure that it comes with the mini-comic that helps explain some of the plot.",1288742400,,393,4.735294117647059
2927183,5,B000UYX4RM,"Even though I give this item a five star rating others might not but I personally found Karas to be very entertaining with some surprisingly strong themes and an unexpected depth to it.

In terms of story and action I'm of the opinion that the movies out do themselves with phenomenally beautiful animation that really brings the world and highly likeable characters to life. Another point is the incredible audio score the movies have, the transformation and battle themes being 'Loads of Awesome' from an acoustic stand point.

That aside though there are some themes and events in the movies that some may find either disturbing or down right horrifying, most of which crop up during the second movie.",1276041600,,704,4.907563025210084
2927184,4,B000UYX4RM,I usually let my son pick the animes we get. But this sounded good so I choose this one. I really like it. However the review is right. It's best to get both at the same time to know what's going on. I recommend it.,1274313600,,215,3.8

2927186,3,B000UYX4RM,"Like many anime movies, this was a series packed into a two parter.  Too many charactors with not enough development.  It had awsome action and grafic detail though.",1261785600,,165,4.857142857142857
2927187,4,B000UYX4RM,"The animation in these movies is outstanding.  The story takes more than one viewing to completely pick up, but is well worth it.",1256515200,,129,4.608695652173913
2927188,5,B000UYX4RM,"This anime was hyped up by a friend.  I was skeptical because he told me it had a ninja that morphed ito a car and also a jet.  But I must say I was wrong this is a hot little anime.  High production value, with great choreography and chase scenes.  This anime focuses on the occult of of japan.  So if you know nothing about japanese folklore it might be alien to you.  But even if it is it is still a great ride.",1250208000,,414,3.869047619047619
2927189,1,B000UYX4RM,MY FAMILY LOVES ANIME BUT THIS WE CAN SAY WAS A COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT. I BOUGHT IT AS A GIFT FOR MY HUSBAND AND HE GAVE IT AWAY- THAT SHOULD SAY IT ALL!,1243382400,,154,3.84375
2927190,4,B000UYX4RM,"It looks great, CGI is amazing, I was hooked from minute one. Also it sounds great, great music that goes with the action very well.

There is just one drawback, too short.  There is just not enought time to make and feel the story deeper, so the makers took the easy way out and simplified it. For an anime series of this caliber a simple plot doesn't fit, it just doesn't.  Maybe they should have made it 13 episodes or something.",1240012800,,432,4.308641975308642
2927191,5,B000UYX4RM,"Karas is a must have Anima movie watching Karas The Prophecy is the best of the two it starts of with hard hitting actions scenes the graphics are so on-point you will be saying ""WoW"" over and over again especially if you watch on HDTV, Karas The Revelation ties in the story line real good as a whole you won't be disappointed, treat your self don't cheat your self, Peace!",1236988800,,374,4.357142857142857

2927195,5,B000UYX4RM,two-part anime.  complicated storyline that reveals itself in small bits over the course of the movie.  this makes for excellent second and third + viewing.  graphics are excellent; music is some of the best i've ever heard in a movie.  fight sequences are fast-paced and very well done.  you won't regret watching this one!,1216339200,5,324,4.925925925925926
2927196,4,B000UYX4RM,"This anime has very good visuals (both CGI and traditional styles are used.)
All of the fight scenes are amazing, and the robotic demons do not necessarily disappoint(I would have preferred to have seen humanoid demons rather than robotic ones.)The only real issue that I had with this anime was the lack of a good ending and a bit of confusion about what exactly the point of the story is at times. Still, I recommend this to any anime fan.",1213833600,,441,4.525
2927197,4,B000UYX4RM,"I'm a big fan of full 3d movies (Final Fantasy, Beowulf, etc.) as well as the 2d (Ghost in the Shell, Bleach, DBZ).  True this is a ""hybrid"" using 2d and 3d; weighing heavier on the 2d.  I wasn't expecting much as I caught The Prophecy on Starz one night.  I actually ended up buying the series before the movie ended.  The artistry with the combination of 2d and 3d moving images is worth the watch.  I've seen some of this combo with other movies of this type (Animatrix) but it just isn't the same.  It took me a few replays to completely understand the plot (and a little wiki action).  All in all I definetely recommend checking it out.",1212969600,,641,4.291666666666667
2927198,5,B000UYX4RM,"The Karas films are absolutely superb! The story line is creative, deep, intriguing, and filled with explosive action. The artwork is extraordinary, a true stroke of genius that blows way the competition!",1212192000,,204,5.40625
2927199,5,B000UYX4RM,This conclusion to the first video owas great. All that i was expecting and more. I enjoyed it and I can not wait to watch it again. Thanks.,1208649600,,140,4.035714285714286
2927200,5,B000UYX4RM,"I remember the first time I saw this movie on cable.  I was stunned by the opening action sequence.  It was exciting and beautiful ... and a little confusing.  Ok, who am I kidding?  It was seriously confusing, but the anime was done so well and the story was so interesting that I had to watch the entire movie and figure it out.  Then, to my shock and horror, it ended at what seemed to be the middle with nothing more then just a ""to be continued"".  So, when the second part came out on DVD, and in a boxed set to boot!!!, I had to have it.  The second part was done just as well as the first in regards to the animation, and the story got even better, even adding some well done twists.  If you're looking for an amazing anime to add to your collection, give this boxed set a shot.  It will not let you down.",1204156800,2,812,4.025
2927201,5,B000UYX4RM,"To really understand Karas, you need to buy the whole set and both movies should be watched together.  Otherwise, it just won't make a lot of sense.  There were many times that I felt that I was missing something important, but by the end of the set most of my questions were answered.  Despite that, I really enjoyed watching these movies.  The art work was an amazing and a beautiful blend of 3D and 2D.  The English voice acting is superb.  Also, the fight scenes are incredible.  The series opens with one of the best fight scenes I've ever seen.  It runs through the whole credits and really sets the tone of the two movies.  You really get the feel that the Karas is otherworldly, not to mention really fast.  There are times when the rest of the animation slows down and stops while the Karas is moving.  It gives you the sense of immense speed and power.

This movie does contain adult language and a significant amount of blood.  However, the gore level is not excessive and fits into the setting.  Even when there was a lot of it, I got the feeling that it was supposed to be that way to add to the scene and not for the gross factor.

All in all, a good watch.  Just pay attention to everything.  Things will be unclear for a while, but eventually it makes sense...for the most part.",1201651200,21,1294,4.347280334728033
2927202,5,B000UYX4RM,"Yes, Karas is indeed a beautifully crafted piece of art. The animation is top class, seamlessly fusing CG and hand drawn animation. The story itself is nothing groundbreaking, but the action sequences will blow you away. The story starts at a fast pace, and may be a little confusing at first, but don't be discouraged and just go with it till the end as all will be revealed eventually. I was also hoping there would be more character. Perhaps 6 episodes is too short for such a task. Despite that the story is still engaging enough. So if you're thinking it's just another senseless action blockbuster, then you're sadly mistaken.
  As a DVD package,it does not offer much extras. However considering the price, it is definitely still worth it. For anime fans, this is one you must have in your collection.",1200700800,4,808,4.723404255319149
2927203,4,B000UYX4RM,"the Prophecy is extraordinary anime/comp. animation ,some of the finest fight scenes ive seen along with  dizziingly intricate subplots with a confusing yet believable tapestry of some alternate existance. Unfortuneately rather than continueing the mystique of the Prophecy,,the Revelation just ends it all in a cleanup battle after simplifiing the subleties that enamoured me in the first movie. Id give the Prophecy 6 stars and the revelation 2, so it gets a 4 overall",1200355200,,470,5.351351351351352

8215712,3,B000UYX4RM,"This 6-episode OVA series(released as two compliation movies in America)was originally a one-shot special from Dark Horse Comics. Written by Nevermen creator Phil Amara, it was of a look at the spiritual underworld of Japanese monsters and other creatures of the night. The anime turned out to be more of a action/horror story about an armored guardian who protects his city from evil demons. It was animated by Taksunoko Production, which has done several other superhero anime from the 70s like Yatterman, Hurricane Polymar, and Casshern, so this was a good evolution for them with some great 3D animation.",1395792000,,608,5.151515151515151
8215713,4,B000UYX4RM,"The movies is fantastic. The animation was very well done. The movie can be confusing if you only watch the first (Prophecy) by itself.

No more than any movie you go see nowadays. I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes Anime.",1388361600,,399,4.405405405405405

8215716,5,B000UYX4RM,"I really love this story, told over the course of two movies. I've seen them separately before but it just isn't right unless they're watched together. It's a great mix of reality and fantasy, horror and moral, that comes together and lets you make the most sense of it the further along you get. There is so much to take in the first time you go through it that it's just as exciting and new while watching it again later. Definitely worth my time and money.",1371340800,,459,4.348837209302325
