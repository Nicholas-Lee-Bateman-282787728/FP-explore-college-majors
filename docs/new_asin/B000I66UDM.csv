I would imagine if you are interested in this movie you are already a avid World War II buff....and have already viewed the great movies of this war, like Saving Private Ryan, Kelly's Hero's, A Beautiful Life, Battle of the Bulge, etc ..... In spite of the language barrier, you can devise exactly what is happening by the action and plot of the movie....and you can even figure out the year by the scene backround maps and such.  It is about German POW's in late WWII, about 1943 - 1944, the Russians are now starting to win the war and driving the German army back into Europe...but the plot is mainly about the POW's, their treatment, the Russian soldiers trauma they have to live with in their previous fighting with the Germans..... as well as the Russian civilians...which must live with the trauma of the German atrocities against the Russians.  Fairly authentic and creepy at times.",1373241600,,986,4.617142857142857
