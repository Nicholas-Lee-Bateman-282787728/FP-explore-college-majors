5198199,5,B008ZQ4WEQ,This is a wonderful movie to watch. It is very encouraging for anyone who has misplaced their hope in God and people. the actors were great also. It show us to never give up hope or trying to encourage others in their daily trials and tribulations.,1368748800,25,248,4.413043478260869

5198205,5,B008ZQ4WEQ,"This was a very sincere story about faith and the Christian walk.  It was neither too preachy or artifical nor did it back away from declaring the makers of the movie views on God.  I found the acting to be superb and the music aided in the storytelling.

5198289,5,B008ZQ4WEQ,GOOD MOVIE,1419292800,,10,4.5
5198290,5,B008ZQ4WEQ,"The title is very good: God is so strong that his love and truth what never harm society (e.g. if a woman has her cyclus: by broken to have safer sex, the problem that that goes on to make more and next to topic Nr. 1 (by the way: Hippies were against war, but lived by much of them free love and changed this way society in these cases, where in the new tollerance today free love or ""outside marriage"" is the same or woken up, hm?)).
The new tollerance is this way, that The Holy Bible can be taken by words of how what is in mind: there are much who say abortion is not a problem and some do say is a problem and called this in this case ""cognition"" (""Erkenntnis"") and ""Meaning"" with the defintions to that what ""cognition"" and ""meaning"" and everything concerning what makes at last not take God at his word outside from Gleichnis and co"". So out of this fact is God never the same while ""meanings"" about e.g. abortion is in mind to understand what is provable: much has let made abortion and say this is not breaking love. And meanings are this way like ""oh yes, I understand"" and is like a theory where is in mind ones picture of what is in mind e.g. one of 50 meanings/thoeries while speaking a meaning can be understood while picture is changing: This is everywhere possible, if the content is at last truth ""The Holy Bible"" the diary of Richard, ""abortion is this way ok, but/or and smoke a cigarette by that while Max in pragnant Jenny"" (but that do only those who have no honor, because this understand everyone: this is absolutely bad) or smoke not"", etc. And what love and truth is breaking, e.g. concerning The Holy Bible, and what is love and truth x times not breaking is on the one hand side a greyzone when (inclusive meanings: while freedom in having meanings was about the new tollerance began to understood different, while to talk and discuss overall about all topics while scientistic reports are odered again and again because ""explaings in new tollerance makes about meaning-advertisemnt during more or less time more or less possible and open, while elections are this way further on ""secret elections"" because meaning is this way like ""there we stand for and education while marks are necessary and educational social behavior is by the way not anylonger this way, that parents of past can belive or not (e.g. in Maine for many many years: Christians ans Atheists) the decission of how they educate is everytime when it's topic e.g. on school ground, in school the kid is hearing. If Max says ""abortion is a murder"" heartpounding moments for him can be scary for him, because in that case ""absolut"" is against ""absolut"" while love is the topic and not at last what is in mind: a picture is at last the possiblity for Max ""can I interview you, please"" if he has the power over the time: but ""I don't want to discuss"" he have heard again and again and ""are you nervous :D"". This is provable, if e.g. abortion is from someone who stay for this, wile interviewed by Max, at last by words or content like ""Why is abortion no unjustice while the mom want to live and her kid not? Why is love not broken if you say, that abortion is no death for a HUMAN, concnering why love is not reaching with what is in mind, that the unborn can never be the friend of my (human) kid? Where is the logic: exact to each of these points? What is the sence of going to school and need mom and dad or taxes to pay food and so on for a child?"" That is why the new tollerance keep in mind and concnering to The Holy Bible what is the truth, is every single content what is spoken by God outside from Gleichnis and co, and however one ""meaning"" is in mind to make taken by words ""ment"", is next to individual meanings what is not taken at words outside of Gleichnis and so, and next to cognitions because of that, come up different truthes what all absolutely will/would fall, if the truth God is, since all eternity and from then to all eternity while God is ever the same while families began here and there, and that is provable, since the new tollerance, broken. Greyzone is sometimes a sin a sin and sometimes not: Keepers of what breaks commandements: If good hearted would know what is kept in mind in e.g. in following case would say: ""Pleas stay back if you want to have joy on my wife."" But asking (...) would give heartpounding moments: understandable. And what love and truth is not breaking: this is ever TOP and harmonize at this point for all who live love at this moment while to live love never harms (while everyone knows: no one can throw the first stone and since NT (Revaltion 22) while Jesus Christ says not that sin is no sin, he said ""if you do, you do"" while at last to stay to truth is ""heartpounding"" moment or the ""sword"" what is ""no to the lie"": Maine has worked): Max knows why: in Maine for many many years it was known by all there: love never harms while breaking commandements (live love is life life while commandements cannot be lived: commandements stand still but can be broken for harm onself or one other), if so, harm everytime. And Max knows that he would be saved even in the times of Old Testament even if he was caught with his school-friend mark, while he was week: even since NT and told God everything, but never that he tells truth if he would go in tollerance. Maine was good and Max will back, even if he would in Maine have had a strong time, but he would now what he would do: Let me and I need time: but I will not begin to change society. OK? Absolutely not the new tollerance. Movie tip: Stand by me (directed by Rob Rainer).

5198324,2,B008ZQ4WEQ,"I thought this movie sounded good, and it had some good reviews on Amazon, so I bought it.... and wish I hadn't. The idea of the movie was really good, and the acting wasn't too bad, other than the attack early in the movie - could they have made a stabbing/mugging look any more faked? I even liked most of  the characters, other than the sister. She was so bland with her personality and acting, I about fell asleep during her parts.

Overall, the plot stunk. As I said, the idea was good, but the carrying out wasn't. It moved slow, the dialog was boring and needed something more. This was wasted money and time.",1391990400,3,616,4.3478260869565215
5198325,4,B008ZQ4WEQ,"I liked this movie but I watched the deleted scenes to see if I could get a better understanding of what was happening.
They deleted the wrong scenes. It was so much clearer when I watched the deleted scenes. I also thought that the music could have been better to support the story. I was a good story and I liked the characters but it seemed like a first try at movie making. I wish they could get some help on polishing it up.",1391558400,9,429,4.119047619047619

5198327,1,B008ZQ4WEQ,"I love contemporary movies with spiritual messages but I cannot recommend this one in good conscience.
The movie is filmed ""bare bones"" - few props, key scenes depicted in sound instead of visuals and rooms devoid of any believable personal dcor & the characters/actors all acted as if they met on the day of the filming - no rapport of any kind!
The dialogue is so forced and awkward I felt embarrassed for all involved in making it - we kept saying ""who talks this way""?

In addition, the complex emotions of personal life changing events are depicted so simplistically that by the end of the movie you're consumed by all the flaws & you just want it to end.

In summary; poor script, poor sets, no character development, awful dialogue - a 10 on the bland-scale!

I'm sure the intent was good, but you can't record this and call it a movie and sell it for $",1388620800,12,860,4.430379746835443

5198331,3,B008ZQ4WEQ,"As I Stand is the kind of movie that doesn't flinch at asking tough theological questions. The premise and plot are straightforward but that doesn't stop it from being a movie that will challenge what it is you believe. Production-wise, it's very clearly an independent film, but that doesn't hold back the talent on the screen or the depth of its ideas. The film addresses serious questions of suffering and finding meaning in the context of faith.",1385337600,5,449,4.8441558441558445

The person who plays the main actor wasn't too bad, but the actors who play the family he stays with in the movie were all pretty dreadful in their acting...very wooden. Also, it was hard to follow because it felt choppy. Scenes would happen and you'd be left scratching your head. The story itself was great, but the delivery of it was badly done.",1508544000,,526,4.43298969072165
