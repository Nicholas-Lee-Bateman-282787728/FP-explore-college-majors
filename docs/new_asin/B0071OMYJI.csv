5048898,5,B0071OMYJI,"This is a 30 minute documentary of the work of Sally Mann shortly after the publication of her controversial book ""Immediate Family"". Most of the discussion is about the photographs in that book however there is some discussion of prior photographs and of a couple of photos which were apparently considered for the book but omitted. For the making of this film Steven Cantor (the director) interviews not only Sally, but also her three children, her husband, and Pat Robertson who compared the selling of pictures of nude children with selling children into prostitution. Pat Robertson in the only one interviewed in the film who objects to Sally's work, but other peoples objections are discussed.
It is clear in the interviews with the children that they were comfortable with being photographed nude, and were proud of the fact that their photographs are hanging in museums around the world. Jessie states in one of her interviews that her mother is more likely to tell her to put on cloths than to remove her cloths, she enjoys running around nude. Also discussed with both Sally and the children are a few photographs where the children's expression shows some signs of frustration. They are clear on the fact that it was not the nudity with which they were frustrated, but how long they had to pose to get the shot.
Sally uses a camera which takes a while to setup and use. Some of the photographs are strictly posed shots where either she or her children came up with an idea for a shot and it was setup totally for the purpose of  getting the shot, but according to Sally are still based on the real life of her children. Other shots were more spontaneous in that the children were doing something which Sally decided would make a good photograph and she told the children to freeze where they were while she setup the camera and took the shot.
The editing of the film jumps between various interviews and the photographs being discussed. The film also includes filming of Sally setting up a few shots and photographing her children. The film does include quite a bit of nudity, especially of Jessie and Virginia, both in the photographs shown, and in the filming of photographs being setup and taken.

This DVD also includes an interview of Steven Cantor by Alec Baldwin. In this interview which runs for 26 minutes, Alec and Steven discuss ""Blood Ties: The Life and Work of Sally Mann"". Along with discussing when, where, why and how the documentary was make several excerpts for the documentary are shown.

Both the documentary and the interview with Steven and interesting and informative. I enjoyed watching both.",1394496000,14,2627,4.7947019867549665
8508538,5,B0071OMYJI,"Blood Ties was an extraordinary documentary on the subject of an artist who desired to provide a photograph history of her three children in the nude.  Sally Mann demonstrated there is a fine line between such art and child pornography.  Her intent was not for devious purposes and demonstrated in the commentary provided the celebrity Alex Baldwin and the Director Steven Cantor.  By their own participation, 6 year old Virginia,
9 year old Jessie and 11 year old Emmett were eccentric, self-possessed youngsters who manifested strong attitudes and powerful resolutions.
This was revealed especially by Emmett who declared in the last photograph of him nude and standing in the river, that the water was very cold and caused his stern facial expression, not being coerced into that photo shot.  There is a basis for Sally Mann's stated intent she was exploring the subtle truths of childhood for each of her youngsters in an ongoing photo series.  As a documentary it is a 5-star production with the extraordinary
intent of the parents.",1462147200,3,1037,5.04093567251462
8508539,4,B0071OMYJI,"Well presented and provided good insight to how she captured the essence of her children.  Nothing bad or distasteful here. If you are offended by family nudity then this is not for you.  Otherwise, well developed work that portrays the children in a natural and comfortable setting, with siblings or other family members.  I really don't see what all the fuss is about.
Full color would have been nice as parts were in black and white.",1448323200,,436,4.7105263157894735

8508545,5,B0071OMYJI,"Sally  is an icon of modern photography who's never shied away from controversial subjects. There are several fascinating things about this DVD that take it way beyond a conventional documentary. First, director Steve Cantor records enthralling -- and lengthy -- footage of interviews with Sally's three kids themselves (11, 9, and 6) and their reactions to their mother's film shoots. Second, he adds very appropriate bookends featuring Sally's speech about her philosophy. Also, it's revealed what images were censored out of the book and why (all four of them had to agree to include EACH shot). Fourth, Cantor also takes us through the backstory on completing his 1991 film, a first effort intended to get him into film school which three years later got him nominated for an Oscar. There's also an interview with Alec Baldwin from about 1998, where Steve adds incisive comments. The book is ""Immediate Family"" and watching this is a beautiful experience.",1425945600,4,959,5.147435897435898

The video quality great as well as scenery. I knew about the video by seeing it listed in a guide on Amazon.com titled THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO GIRLS IN COMING OF AGE MOVIES 2013 by Carl Wo,.",1413936000,2,337,4.451612903225806
