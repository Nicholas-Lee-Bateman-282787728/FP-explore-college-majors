8473125,1,B004MMEDYQ,"This documentary is described as a controversial, behind the scenes look at the modeling industry.  It is not even near what it claims to be.  Actually, it is seven incredibly narcissistic people being allowed to ramble on  without interviewer guidance or control about whatever they want that might tangentially be connected to their work in the fashion industry.  I have never been so disappointed to have spent even a dollar ninety nine to rent this terrible, completely uninformative, stone-cold boring film.  This film teaches nothing, does not remotely entertain or hold attention, and you will have an intense desire to get your money back immediately.",1400284800,,659,5.238095238095238

8473127,3,B004MMEDYQ,I purchased this for my class and found it informative but at the same time it seemed incomplete (but to be fair I was interrupted a lot while watching it).  I'm going to watch it again to give it a fair chance but I'm glad its a work purchase vs a private.,1362182400,,257,3.9423076923076925
