8126966,5,B000FUX3RC,"FLIP THE FROG is an excellent study of smooth animation
and storyplots skill. Each cartoon is wonderful and full
of imagination. I can highly recommend this to anyone who wants to be entertained, and who wants to study what
is possible to do in animation. --- I also can recommend
Van Beuren animation studio's human cartoon characters
TOM AND JERRY. It too is an example of smooth animation
and imagination. With these DVD samples, you don't need
anything else to study. You won't need a thousand animation books to study. But buy it because these are
the best examples of animation there is, and highly enjoyable. It will make you grin. You will be sorry if you let the chance to buy these escape you. You can buy
this through Amazon.com ---- I did! Luisa Felix, Hoboken, New Jersey.",1324857600,,785,4.654676258992806
