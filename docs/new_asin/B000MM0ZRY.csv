It also gave me an insight into many of the aspects I have heard about yet not seen (the HP garage, Bucks restaurant where Netscape and others were founded, the computer museum, burning man) - next time i hear people talking of these online i'll now have a picture in my head.

There was also a lot about the history and innovation of Silicon Valley - this is where i wish there was more. I could really see this video being the first in a series, each subsequently looking at a specific area whether art, tech or culture. There is just so much to delve into.

Most importantly, I'd recommend anyone starting a technology company (like myself) to watch this video - many of the people speaking in this video created our industry and listening to just a few minutes of each serves as amazing inspiration for us all!

They interviewed people who were there from the start (of the most recent tech leap, not from the time of Stanford's beginnings and its contribution to the current Silicon Valley) and others who came along just for the ride. Steve O'Hare and Fleeta Siegel did an absolutely hands-down job distilling the story of why Silicon Valley was the place where technology, money, creativity and drive melded to create the leaps and bounds in the advancement that brought us to the extraordinary place we are today. I've been covering the Valley for what seems like a millennia and have seen every documentary, read every book and article, but it took this team to give the Valley's story a breezy, purposeful and intriguing look behind the curtain. The documentary takes a fresh look that only a UK team could provide. I love this film!!! A must-have for anyone looking for the true meaning of innovation and how to capture it in a bottle and take it home. Nice!

Cheers,

Of course, most of them are 20 years older. This stuff was interesting to me, but others have done better, much better in painting a high level portrait of the era.",1178409600,,323,4.491525423728813
