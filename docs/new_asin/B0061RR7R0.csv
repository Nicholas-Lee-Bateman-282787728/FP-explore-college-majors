8490932,3,B0061RR7R0,"This movie is dubbed English.  Two brothers, one is a stage opera actor and he was killed after confronting a well connected kung-fu school instructor who was flirting with his wife and the other brother came from out of town who wanted to revenge for his brother.  He has to go around killing four main characters who came up with the idea of killing his brother while gambling in a mahjong game.  While in search of the four killers, the brother finds a childhood friend with whom his feeling of love returns.  She assists him in his search and the two makes a commitment to one day marry and become farmers.  My critique of the film is that it's another good vs. bad fighting, but the fight scenes are pretty well choreographed.",1494806400,,731,4.507575757575758

8490938,4,B0061RR7R0,"David Chiang carries this movie and he is great as a single-minded brother bent on revenge at all cost.  It is a rather short movie.  It is quick and to the point.  Chiang had a great wardrobe, and his hair was on fleek.",1419120000,,220,4.069767441860465
8490939,2,B0061RR7R0,"2 stars for the product in question. VCD's ****ING SUCK! It won't play on my Blu-Ray player but will play on my computer. The unfortunate thing is that I don't watch movies on computer because it is stupid and irritating.

The movie itself kicks ass. The story is dark, depraved and very well told and there are lots of blood gushy goodness to satisfy the subconscious violent necessities of life........ and junk.

I am in a livid state of mind over the fact that the VCD won't play on the Blu-ray and it shall piss me off til the day I die. (or whenever I get another Disk Player that can actually read VCD's.",1413331200,,611,4.350877192982456
