2690987,5,B000KGGISM,"A must see film about the horror of child terrorists and soldiers...not just for society at large but for these young adults as well.  The film opens with a boy being sold by his Lebanese parents to become a child solider who is indoctrinated (as Number 3) to hate Jews and Gentiles. He becomes an excellent soldier for the cause of hate and is then flown to France to fulfill a mission to assassinate the President of France. A true story.

Filmed as a thriller - documentary style - the master terrorists have everything planned to the last detail but this...they failed to consider the impact of a friendship this young boy develops for a Parisian boy his own age. The most touching scene is the gentleness in which the French boy comforts the young soldier who is deeply troubled by nightmares in losing his parents and his innocence.  And the most haunting line of the film, spoken by the child soldier - ""what's it like being a boy.""",1174348800,18,939,4.544378698224852

8156720,5,B000KGGISM,"Interesting look at the life of a Middle Eastern Boy who is brought into the world of terrorisom, but decides to do the right thing at great cost. More engaging now that Terrorist groups are very active and dominate the news daily.",1436140800,,231,4.523809523809524
8156721,5,B000KGGISM,"I saw this in Germany years ago on TV and really liked it. I vowed someday I'd see it again. A very dark, disturbing story of the true face of Islam. This movie was made long before Al'Quida and ISIS and makes one understand their true agenda.",1423872000,,243,4.191489361702128

8156723,5,B000KGGISM,"A orphaned Lebanese boy, Djilali (Tewfik Jallab) was recruited by terrorists to undergo army training and was subsequently sent to Paris to assassinate to French president.  He meets Karim (Younesse Boudache) and they became inseparable till the very end.  The assassination was planned to the last detail, but the perpretrators missed out on one thing which they failed to realise - the bond between Djilali and Karim. Banned in several countries for political reasons, the movie's storyline is based on real-life events and not imagined.  Director Gilles de Maistre had put together a superb cast and crew in the filming of this movie and it was nominated for Best Picture at the Cannes Festival in 1994.  Both Tewfik and Younesse gave remarkable performances, and the cinematography is good, taking the audiences to a few popular spots in Paris.",1376265600,,848,5.1231884057971016
8156724,5,B000KGGISM,"The subtitles some times go by too fast, but the movies is very well shot and acted. I think it is a terrible shame that it happened and worse, a lot worse happens elsewhere. Others have told the gist of the movie so i will only say that the prologue and epilogue are written in French in movie but are added in English as special features.  The only other thing i will say is that it didn't end the way i wanted.  the hero......well, yin find out, it worth a look",1370736000,,464,4.087912087912088
8156725,5,B000KGGISM,"I owned this DVD a few years ago, but I gave it to a young friend to help him think more critically about current events.  As an educator/social worker who had extensive experience with youth, I found the ""formation"" of this young boy into a killer fascinating. From his background, it was understandable that he could be malleable, but he, also, never forgot that he was ""sold"". Children think critically much more then we give them credit.  A turning point in his life was having a friend his age for the first time.  It obviously deeply impacted him.  I confess that I took unholy delight in his execution of the ""bad guys"".  I was glad to read in the ""footnotes"" that he went on to be a successful student and hopefully have a positive adult future. I was not surprised that his friend became another casualty of urban poverty and addiction.  I recommend that adults share this film with youth to show them that everything is not so black and white.  I think that it can be helpful in developing critical thinking.",1341532800,,1018,4.56043956043956
8156726,3,B000KGGISM,"This is an intriguing and powerful film that never quite reaches it potential.  Just when you start to really get wrapped up, the story stretches credulity to the breaking point.  The films young stars are remarkable and that is consistent. There's a lot to be said, but I don't want to ""review"" the film.  I want to comment on the tags.

My first reaction: Huh?!?!?!  This is a film about a boy who whose family has been torn apart by war and Israeli aggression and because of that he is so desperate for revenge.  Exploiting this, unscrupulous radicals take his name, give him a number and turn him into a child killer.  He's sent to France to befriend another boy, learn his ways and get into an event in which the French President will be meeting with children in order to assassinate him.  This is a film in which children are exploited and nearly murdered in cold blood. It's a political thriller.  Not the greatest, but a political thriller nonetheless.  So what is up with these tags?  This is not a ""gay"" film.  The kids pre-adolescent!  I don't remember any nudity.  Did the tags get mixed up with those from some kind of soft porn film perhaps?

It is adapted from a French novel by Claude Klotz and Marie Lescure.  You can find it it you search on their names.",1260748800,2,1459,4.865853658536586
8156727,4,B000KGGISM,"Boy from Lebanon gives a great in-site into what is happening in Iraq,Iran, Lebanon, Israel, and other countries. Much can be learned in protecting your child from such actions. These kids are deprived of any normal childhood for the sake of religious and political gain. This is a must see for parents.",1207526400,,303,4.846153846153846
8156728,5,B000KGGISM,"I loved the actors, especially the two children.  The story is good, worth watching.  I don't understand the tags, there's not so much as a shirtless scene anywhere in the movie, everyone is fully dressed for winter in Europe, no gay or romantic scenes, and I wouldn't call it coming-of-age they are really young.  But overall well filmed & worth watching.",1202428800,4,356,4.80327868852459
