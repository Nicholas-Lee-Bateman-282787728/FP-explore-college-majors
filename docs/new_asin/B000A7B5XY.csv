8075551,5,B000A7B5XY,"I loved the video.  This and the Essential videos really work my entire body.  I can tell this one is more advanced than the Essential just by the minor changes in how the moves are performed.  I see reviews of both these videos that say they don't work the core or are slow, etc.  This mystifies me, as I've been doing Pilates for years and, to me, these are extremely challenging.  There are moves on each of these that I find quite challenging.  I love the vertical excerpts at the end.  They add the extra oomph that really make the workouts satisfying.  I've said this before and I'll say it again, focus and execution are the key in Pilates.  Pilates is not about cranking out repetitions or doing things at extremely high intensity levels.  After years of bellydance for fitness, I realize that performing the moves well is what ""works out"" the body.  I would recommend the Stott Bosu workouts to individuals who are ready to put aside all the conditioning that society has fed them about what it means to ""work out.""",1447632000,2,1024,4.540983606557377

It arrived quickly and in good condition too.
It is now in my collection of favorite workout dvds",1378684800,2,125,5.3
8075553,2,B000A7B5XY,"Lots of ""dead"" time in the workout while you are listening to instruction.  Does not have any challenging moves until the end of the workout.  Would call this beginner, not intermediate.",1378512000,7,186,4.967741935483871
8075554,3,B000A7B5XY,I was not to impressed with the flow. It was too fast for all the position changes. I did not think it worked the core as much.,1360627200,2,127,3.740740740740741
