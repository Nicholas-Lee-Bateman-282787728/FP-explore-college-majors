8402516,4,B003QTBT34,"Expect the usual exaggerated over the top acting style (by western standards) and then some.  The movie is a silly slap stick comedy with non stop action, and with lots of profanity.
Filmed in Hong Kong in 1978 this movie is campy and tacky and an outrageous comedic satire of aspects of Chinese life and culture.  It is a very funny movie.

Spoiler alert!
The movie begins with a woman trying to elope with her boyfriend, who is in his bedroom asleep, on her motor cycle.  The boyfriends sister is against the marriage and chases them in her car.  Then the young mans sister arranges a marriage between her younger brother and a very rich outrageous womans dead daughter.  The ghost of the girl (now grown) is at the wedding celebration and the young man falls in love with the ghost, abandoning his fiance.  Later the sister wants to separate her brother from the ghost and get him back with his fiance.
The ending however is not very funny at all.
If you like this style of Hong Kong and Chinese movies then I would suggest many Jackie Chan movies and Kung Fu Hustle and Dim Sum Funeral
P.S. - I really like the editorial description above.  The funky English is fun.",1390089600,,1170,4.485849056603773
