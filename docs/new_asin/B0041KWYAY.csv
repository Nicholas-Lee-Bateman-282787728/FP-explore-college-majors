I think it is more or less correct to say that in that day a prevailing attitude in France about children was that they were essentially innocent until puberty ended their period of innocence. In that sense this film is about a kind of innocence though the warlike actions of the kid gangs isn't especially benign. The innocence is found in the war or fighting not being especially serious or bloodthristy. It is relatively innocent rivalry much as the removal of buttons and laces is an innocent version of (I suppose) castration or humiliation same as the nudity is not sexual and stems more from an innocent prank idea to defeat the other gang. I was reminded of this movie, which I doubt I saw at the time, because of the impending release of a new version in addition to the other version of a few decades ago set in Ireland. There are some interesting elements in the original. And though I didn't find it great I did find it charming (innocent) in the way the characters and setting come across. I found it pleasant to look back at an earlier time when childhood and early adolesence was seen in simpler terms without drugs, guns, or sex fueling the young.",1362787200,,1285,4.543103448275862
