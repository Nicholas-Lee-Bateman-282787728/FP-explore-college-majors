The B&W version shows the play twice. I was at that game in a 1st base box seat and could be seen screaming for the ball to be thrown to 1st. Doak Ewing insists that version never existed. He sent me a DVD copy of your VHS tape and got insulted when I told him it wasn't what I expected. I lent my B&W to a brother who now can't find it , if I get it back I'll send you and Doak copies to prove I'm not crazy.",1384819200,,562,3.853448275862069
7832844,5,6302985676,"This is the first World Series' video in color and it was a colorful series.  The Yankees rebounded from having lost to the Braves in '57 to win, backed by the pitching of Bullet-Bob Turley and the slugging of right fielder Hank Bauer, who clobbered four homers and hit a lusty .323 batting average.  Outside of the perfect game series of l956 with Don Larsen, this ranks as the best series ever for Yankee fans--definitely one to collect for any fan--and one of the most exciting of all fall classics!",1149552000,,502,4.566666666666666
7832845,4,6302985676,"In the era before salaries skyrocketed and the uniforms were perfectly tailored; when pitchers pitched a complete game; when the designated hitter would have been unthinkable...a great World Series was played - and not just because my team played. Whitey Ford, Bob Turley, Warren Spahn, Lew Burdette, Don Larsen...Mantle, Berra, Bauer, Aaron, Matthews came to play.

As a Mickey Mantle-New York Yankees fan I am fascinated to watch the Commerce Comet in his prime. His power and speed were awesome at age 27. Watching Yogi Berra compete is another plus -a master Catcher and contact hitter.

This video has a pre-Series prefacing section with the Voice Of The Yankees, Mel Allen, actually giving us the history of the World Series films! Then we get into a *filmed* (and ofcourse heavily edited) color documentary.

They needed to win this one. Following the '49 to '53 streak of winning every single Series, they didn't win again until '56, then lost in '57. A loss in '58 would have been significant.

The following year was a devastasting disappointment as they finished third; an injured Mantle found a way to score over 100 runs, but it just didn't happen for the team and the fans. The 1958 World Series takes on special meaning in light of that, plus the fact that the team played their hearts out in '60 and lost to the Pirates.",1135036800,2,1336,4.7956521739130435

But beating the Yankees in the World Series is one thing; beating them two times in a row is another, as the defending World Champion Milwaukee Braves found out in 1958. This was despite the fact that the Braves of Manager Fred Haney took a 3-1 lead in the series on the Bronx Bombers, who became the second team since 1925 to come back from a 3-1 deficit to win the Series.
The series started in Milwaukee when Warren Spahn pitched a complete game, getting the victory when Bill Bruton drove in the winning run in the bottom of the 10th inning. In the next game the Braves knocked out two Yankee pitchers in the first inning as Lew Burdette not only pitched a complete game but hit a three-run home run himself (Remember, Burdette had won three games in the previous World Series). Back at Yankee Stadium Don Larsen and Ryne Duren combined for a shutout in Game 3, but then Warren Spahn (who just passed away this week) turned the tables on the Yankees, pitching a two-hit shutout against Whitey Ford. All the Braves needed was one more win to clinch the series.
The MVP for the 1958 Series ended up being Yankee fireballer ""Bullet"" Bob Turley, who did not last an inning in his first start but who would win two of the final three games and save the other to end up 2-1 with a 2.76 ERA and 13 strikeouts. In Game 5 Turley pitched the third consecutive shutout at the big stadium in the Bronx, giving up only five hits and the two teams headed back to Milwaukee. For the third time Spahn and Ford matched up and the Braves knocked out the Yankee ace lefty early. The game against went into extra innings, but this time Spahn gave up a homerun to Gil McDougald and another run in the 10th as the Yankees ended up winning 4-3 with Turley getting the save. That set up the decisive Game 7, which was tied at 2-2 through seven. In the eighteen Yogi Berra started a rally with two outs by hitting a double off of Burdette, who was trying to win the decisive game for the second year in a row. Elston Howard singled him in and later Moose Skowron capped off the scoring with a three-run homer.
The victory gave Casey Stengel his seventh and final title with the Yankees, tying him with Joe McCarthy. Yogi Berra set records with by playing in his 61st World Series game and getting his 61st hit, both of which were records that he would continue to extend in the 1960s. But despite the presence of future Hall of Famers Mickey Mantle, Hank Aaron, Whitey Ford, Warren Spahn, Yogi Berra, and Eddie Mathews, it was Turley and Yankee outfielder and ex-marine Hank Bauer, who hit four home runs and set a World Series mark of getting hits in 17 games in a row, who ended up being the heroes. This black & white video of the Series highlights represents another shining moment in Yankee history and the last moment of glory for the Braves in Milwaukee.",1069891200,3,2970,4.4116575591985425
