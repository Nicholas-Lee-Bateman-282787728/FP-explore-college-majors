The basic workouts are Chest, Back & Shoulders and Bi's & Tri's.  The exercises themselves are traditional heavy weight ones, but the sequencing and tempo of the sets make them feel fresh and new.

You work each muscle group completely before moving on to the next group.  There are two sets of 10 reps; on the third set, you work to failure.  At the end of each muscle group, you'll do a burn set.  The burn set uses tubing, firewalker loop and/or body weight.  You feel the burn on the third set of each exercise and then an extra burn on the final burn set.

I just love heavy weight training and I was very excited about this DVD.  I normally do splits with the push/pull concept, meaning you work opposing muscle groups in workout.  Working chest and back would be an example of push/pull.  It's fun to mix things up with this workout.

The workouts:

*Chest, Back & Shoulders - 50:43 minutes
*Bi's & Tri's - 37:15 minutes
*Bonus Core #1 - 10:26 minutes.

Equipment needed:

*Dumbbells
*Bench or Step with 5 risers per side (NOTE:  You can make do with fewer risers per side)
*Firewalker Loop
*Medium Resistance Tubing.

Why I enjoy Burn Sets:

* The workout versatility.  There are numerous premixes, both longer and shorter.  I love adding on the Bonus Core workout.

* The burn set concept.  I love working muscles to failure.  After working to failure, I love trying to still work that muscle with another exercise.  Afterwards,  I feel so strong and accomplished.

* Room to grow.  I couldn't come close to matching the weights Cathe uses. But as I work with my 1 rep max, I can continue getting stronger with each workout.  Cathe's weights are shown on the screen and they are helpful as a guide.

* Cathe's form tips.  When doing incline bench presses, it's good to stand up, put the weights on your thighs and then sit down on the bench to do the press.  All the years I've been working out and I never thought to lift my weights this way.  This is a much safer way to get heavy weights in place, especially on an incline.

*The music didn't bother me.  I usually don't like Cathe's choice of music, but in this case I was enjoying the workout so much that I didn't even notice the music.

There are a few things to note about this workout.  I don't consider them to be negatives, but you should be aware of them. The things:

* There is at least 30 seconds rest between each exercise.  This may seem excessive to you if you are used to doing endurance-type exercises.  These workouts are using heavy weights and you really do need that recovery time so your muscles can work hard in the next set.

* The Bonus Core #1 has lots of full sit-ups and they are done very quickly.  These can really tweak your back if you aren't careful.  I do lots of Pilates and barre, so I am very familiar with the correct form of literally pealing your back off the floor one vertebra at a time.

Can you tell that I love this workout?  It's my favorite of all the Xtrains.  I highly recommend it to those wanting fun and effective strength training routines.",1364428800,,3181,4.423875432525952
