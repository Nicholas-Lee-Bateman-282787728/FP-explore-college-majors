7870522,5,6304400993,"ONE SHOULD APPRECIATE A CHILD'S FILM FOR IT'S INTENTION, THIS FILM IS SWEET AND HOLDS A CHILD'S ATTENTION AND EXPLORES THEIR IMAGINATION.  YOU NEED NOT BE A DOUG FAN TO BUY THIS FILM YOU NEED ONLY BE A FAN OF CHILDRENS CARTOONS. ""A REVEIWER"" (JUST A NORMAL PERSON HERE AT AMAZON) WAS FAR TOO HARSH WITH THEIR REVEIW.  WANT A CLASSIC? BUY GONE WITH THE WIND. THIS FILM IS FOR CHILDREN AND THOSE AT HEART!",1092528000,3,403,4.36
