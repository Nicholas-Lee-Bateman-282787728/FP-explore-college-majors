8159157,2,B000KWUNT6,"I'm usually good with hardware (can install devices into my computer). This kit was really confusing. You have to remove the ends of the plastic cable to expose the colored wires, then you have to individually slide each wire into super tiny holds on the cat 5 plug. this alone is tough. whats worse is that the wires have to go in a certain order for it to work. (the kit does not explain this well) I tried to find diagrams on the web, and each site had different configurations. none of them worked. all this cable is just sitting in my closet now collecting dust.",1199923200,2,567,4.3584905660377355
