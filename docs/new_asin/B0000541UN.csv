8270392,1,B0000541UN,"Initially,I was delighted to come across this DVD since my father, Myron Waldman, is one of the featured animators. Knowing that there are pristene prints available of ""Hawaiian Bird"" and ""Hunky & Spunky"", I expected a wonderful digital keepsake of Dad's work. Then I watched it. This is an absolute abomination... the worst DVD I have purchased of anything... the audio has a constant rumble which sounds like a train throughout.  As for the video quality, it's even worse than the audio.  This is obviously a transfer of videotapes that are several generations removed from the master print... I wouldn't be surprised if these were just taped off television.  For any serious collector of animation or anyone who enjoys cartoons, please wait until these works are properly remastered and packaged.",983664000,56,799,5.130769230769231
