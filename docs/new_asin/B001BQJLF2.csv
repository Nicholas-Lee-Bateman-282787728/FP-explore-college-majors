3497832,5,B001BQJLF2,"(But, your mileage may vary...) I liked these independently made flicks. But I can understand how they might not be for the regular consumer of mass media. So buyer beware....

Watching these movies reminded me of a book I read earlier this year; ""If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor"" by Bruce Campbell. It's in part an autobiographical account of how he and his buddies (such as Sam Raimi and his brother) made similar independent films in their youth - such as the ""Evil Dead"" series of movies. It's clear from reading this book that making such independent fare is hard work and in no small degree something that they put their heart into. The same I imagine was true for the people who created the films in this set and the ""Decrepit Crypt of Nightmares 50 Movie Pack"" (I bought both).

I noticed that several of the other reviewers made comments along the lines of - ""I could do this"" or ""My kid could make this"".... My suggestion if that is true; get your stuff together and go for it! Who knows - maybe someday we will seeing a major blockbuster you made.",1226880000,8,1078,4.467005076142132
3497833,1,B001BQJLF2,"This seemed a good combination of movies, for a husband who grew up in the fifties and sixties. It turned out to be filled with amature photographers attempts at horror. It seemed like my neighbor down the street took home movies with patched up sets, and very poor sound quality and then tried to put it to video. My kids could do better with our video camera.",1226880000,3,361,4.402985074626866

I haven't seen them all but since I am in ""At the house of madness"", I have seen that one and it is very well done! You won't be disappointed! [...]

I hope you all decide to buy the pack!

8284284,4,B001BQJLF2,"I liked about 20 films here quite a bit. They were pretty good and the acting was good to passable.  They were great Saturday night  films to eat pizza, drink soda or a beer and watch with friends. Most moved pretty fast. Zombies , Sci- Fi, and weird creatures, What more can you ask.  Another 15-20 were so bad they were good.  They were fun to laugh at They would be great for MST3000. They rest were unwatchable. A few of that bunch were not even horror.  They were pretty bad. I will watch the good ones over again for sure. I found this to be the best low budget movie box set of the series.",1404777600,,596,4.103448275862069
8284285,3,B001BQJLF2,"Oh I knew exactly what I was buying, a big pile of microbudget movies so awful they couldn't get real distribution. If you like bad, bad, bad movies, these are winners in the category! I must admit I'm having trouble getting through all of them, and think some of the directors should be spanked until they bleed for not even trying, but it's all good goofy fun. So far no lost classics of badness, just regular badness, but for the badness category you can't be disappointed in the price.",1387843200,,489,4.50561797752809
8284286,3,B001BQJLF2,"Shortly after I first got this box set, not wanting a series of review requests from Amazon, I wrote:

""As of now, I have only watched a few of the films from this set; that's because I think giving an analytical review would inevitably end up parroting the other reviewers and/or stating stuff that's should already be obvious about this box set.

I write this shortly after seeing one called Demons in my Head, which was kind of painful to watch, but it makes me confident that none of these films can make me regret buying this set.

I bought this because I recognized at least four movies I'm familiar with and enjoyed (Swamp Zombies, Raving Maniacs, the Trees movies), as well as many films that I'm curious about (Machine Head, Hell's Highway, anthologies, practical effects monster movies and there's at least one haunted house movie here).

And of course there's also some really weird movies.
[4 stars]""

And as you can see from the new rating, I'm not entirely satisfied. Before it wore out my interest, 26-27 films were ""hits"" and 19 were ""misses"". Doesn't sound too bad? Well, keep in mind, this IS a 50 movies box set after all, and as such all a movie has to do to be a ""hit"" is to provide the minimum expectations in mindless entertainment. As such, a ""miss"" would be a movie that really doesn't provide a reason for anyone to watch it, and let's face it, even in a cheap movies box set that's not good enough.

Don't get me wrong; some movies were pretty enjoyable. But I'm not going to deny there were times I was plain sick of this. The films are going to be hit-or-miss for anyone and watching all of them is terribly time consuming, so I'd expect most people would often get the feeling they're wasting their time.",1275523200,,1734,4.506369426751593
8284287,4,B001BQJLF2,"I picked ""Skeleton Key"" more or less at random as the first film to watch from this collection and that set the tone for my expectations. This is ,for the most part. funny, inventive stuff. ""Trees"" is a very funny low budget parody of ""Jaws"" which was worthwhile whereas ""Reservoir Cats"" did NOT deliver the goods, even as a low budget parody. The inventiveness of the Effects People involved in these films is to be applauded and in many low budget efforts the power of suggestion is worth just as much as the most spectacular Special Effects exploding head. At times I felt I was watching Existential End Times Porn as in the case of ""Johnny Sunshine"" which delivered the goods on many levels. Elements of Dada (intentional or not. does it matter?) and experimental film abound and just the JOY OF MAKING A MOVIE is evident in even the goofier efforts. Lots of Gore and a pretty high incidence of naked breasts but its for ART so shut up already. Low budget independent films are the raw materials that thankfully filter UP to the high budget guys. Quentin Tarentino directs the remale of ""Johnny Sunshine"" ?  HMMMMMMMM !?!?!?",1264291200,3,1128,4.668341708542713
8284288,5,B001BQJLF2,"Judge for yourself.  As with all movies, you never really know until you see it yourself.  If you have an independent mind and are capable of forming your own opinions, then do so.  But don't let the anonymous haters bash something you have never seen.  Every good movie ever made has had someone criticize it.  And every amateur wanna be critic says they could film it on their kids camera and so on.  But they don't and they can't or they'd be forced to admit that it 's not as easy as they think.  If all anyone ever did was criticize, we'd have nothing to watch.  So respect the process and the effort and use your own brain. Did they really expect to get 50 (Or however many) movies for $14.99 and get big budget releases.  Really?  They didn't know that they were buying cheap indie horror films made on a shoestring budget?  Really? They expected something else?  If that's the depth of their intellectual perception, why should anyone listen to their opinion?  You shouldn't.  So judge for yourself and have some fun.",1254182400,4,1025,4.530054644808743

8284290,1,B001BQJLF2,"Maybe I'm disappointed because I misunderstood the taglines or ads for this product, but I mistakenly thought it was similar to the Creepshow series or series like Vault of Horror.
Here I found myself watching very low budget films, some of which can be bettered my my own home movies.
The films in this collection lack originality or decent acting.
For that I could have watched television.

Very disappointed, sadly.",1246838400,,418,4.9714285714285715
8284291,1,B001BQJLF2,"If you are looking for weird video to show at a party, this is perfect. I could not finish watching the fifteen I attempted to watch. I would not give these a B movie rating. Perhaps a E movie rating.
The plus side of this collection is you can see that the people involved making these were obviously having fun. That's the good part. The bad part; it's like watching someone else's kids in a school play where you don't know anyone.",1245888000,7,434,4.304878048780488
8284292,3,B001BQJLF2,"Yes, low budget horror.  The distributors seemingly ""crank"" these suckers out left n' right.  But don't forget, there are people out there who take time and effort and money to make them themselves.  There are some classic moments in ""Dr. Shock's Grindhouse of Horrors.""  I've seen this three short movie trilogy screened in Hollywood.  Audiences were thoroughly entertained by the first two shorts, ""Dead and Breakfast"" as well as ""Blood sucking Hillbillies.""  (These are both half hour shorts within the movie ""Dr. Shock's Grindhouse of Horrors."")
