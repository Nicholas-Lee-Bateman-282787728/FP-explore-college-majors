2013506,4,B0001LYFHM,"I showed this rating because the movie is very good and it gave you an insight on who the men were defending the Alamo. The film is black and white and it is very old but for the era it was made in it is a very good movie.  I love history and this is an insight into history and I am from Texas,",1397088000,,295,3.609375
2013507,5,B0001LYFHM,This movie was real well done.  For this time era that it was made it was well presented and actors were excellent.,1395792000,,115,4.2272727272727275
2013508,5,B0001LYFHM,"As a Texan who had ancestors riding along side of General Sam Houston, I can appreciate many of the historical references during the movie. My cousin would have been proud to see this movie. He served with the First Volunteer Texican Calvary until the war ended at San Jacinto, Texas, 1836.",1395532800,,290,4.705882352941177
2013509,1,B0001LYFHM,Really outdated-not factual-Cannon used at Gonzales was never at Alamo-poor sound quality. Poor casting of historical figures. Didn't bother to watch ending.,1387238400,,157,6.181818181818182
2013510,2,B0001LYFHM,This one has some of the worst dialogue I've seen. I watched it to see what one of the older movies was like and it actually was so bad it was funny at times. The direction many times did not fit what the scenes were about. You might want to pass this one up.,1368835200,,259,3.814814814814815
2013511,5,B0001LYFHM,"I like old black and white movies the best. They just tell the story with no social message, drugs, vulgar language or etc. This was a simple version of the ""Remember the Alamo"".It also has a patriotic tinge to it which we are in desperate need of today. In fact yesterday was the 170th anniversery of that famous day.",1362614400,5,318,4.406779661016949
2013512,3,B0001LYFHM,"Harry Fraser's ""Heroes of the Alamo"" is an enjoyable action western. Perhaps it is not strictly history, but it is a progressive take on the Alamo story that tells us more about the famous historic episode's background. Great to see Earle Hodgins in a starring role. He aquits himself well as the earnest and honest leader of the settlers Stephen Austin who respects Mexico's rights over Texas.",1299542400,5,394,4.895522388059701
2013513,3,B0001LYFHM,"Very enjoyable little films about the Alamo if you can survive the horrible large bright logo ""the Alamo"" in the corner of both films.  This greatly ruins the viewing experience and is a despicable practice.  That is why this only gets 3 stars.  The Heroes of the Alamo print is a bit dark but is otherwise fine with no splices and is a Columbia Pictures print.  The 36 surviving minutes of Davy Crockett At the Fall of the Alamo is a tinted print which looks pretty decent.  If not for the logo issue, this would have been a very good release.  What's the point of releasing films like this(especially the surviving footage), if it is going to be multilated like this.",1244332800,8,669,4.487603305785124
2013514,1,B0001LYFHM,The Battle of the Alamo was about slavery and territorial expansion. Those that died at the Alamo were racist slave owners.,1236556800,2,123,4.904761904761905
8014296,1,B0001LYFHM,Couldn't hear it with my bad hearing,1461196800,,36,4.285714285714286
8014297,2,B0001LYFHM,Fell asleep 20 minutes into it.,1434240000,,31,4.333333333333333
8014298,1,B0001LYFHM,"Very old time, not very factual, acting typical of period, not very entertaining unless you wish to see how a bad movie could be made.",1433721600,,134,4.4
8014299,3,B0001LYFHM,"If you follow the Alamo story you will find a log of accurate details here. From Davey Cockett showing up after losing a TN election to the lone survivor allowed to live by Aanta Anna, you will find a decent telling of the actual story. But if you are watching it for the acting or action scenes, forget it",1432944000,,306,4.203389830508475
8014300,3,B0001LYFHM,"It's ok but, by today's standards, slow.",1418083200,,40,4.857142857142857
8014301,4,B0001LYFHM,"For the age of this film, it was surprisingly interesting, especially to see the way the writers viewed the history and personalities of this great event.",1412121600,,154,4.961538461538462
8014302,3,B0001LYFHM,"Definitely dated in the early days of movie talkies, but worth watching if you like Texana or study old films.",1407974400,,110,4.55
8014303,1,B0001LYFHM,Typical Amazon Prime movie!,1406332800,,27,6.0
8014304,1,B0001LYFHM,This was very old movie with very poor picture quality and sound. Would not recommend it to anyone unless you are hooked on Alamo movies.,1399420800,,137,4.52
8014305,4,B0001LYFHM,"No one will ever really know what took place at the Alamo.  Rather than focusing on the three big names: Travis, Bowie and Crocket, this movie dwells more on the everyday farmer and rancher -- specifically Mr. and Mrs. Dickenson.  Dickenson was one of the few men actually trained for war.",1399161600,,289,4.647058823529412
