2322364,5,B0009UVBS6,"Another good account from THE WAR ZONE; I really was ignorant of the Waffen SS before I saw this documentary.

Himmler's creation of the Knights of past and the esoteric runes that were used to keep out lesser man.

Richard Greenwood the narrator is eloquent in this documentary and also the music creates a kind of atmosphere that keeps you on edege during the film.

Himmler was a chicken farmer that was a sycophant to Hitler.

Of course the men of the SS were strong Nazi's and were held to the highest form of pure fighting men. The regular army was I think jealous and afraid of these men.

The interesting fact I learned about these men were that they were to bare sons before entering battle.

In the end Himmler sollowed cynide to escape his responsiblity for the Waffen SS actions. A well documented and researched film and very well writen by Alasdair Simpson and Directed and Edited by Michael Campbell.",1142380800,8,915,4.617283950617284
2322365,3,B0009UVBS6,A standard review with nothing new. The description says it is a color DVD. This is not true: everything is black and white.,1138060800,56,124,4.434782608695652

8066891,4,B0009UVBS6,"needs more history related to the waffen SS,its uniforms, personnelbut it gives you an idea. not bad for the price.",1357776000,,115,4.8
8066892,1,B0009UVBS6,Another slapped together video that foisted upon the public by a cynical and opportunistic publisher. There really is nothing worthwhile on this disc. The historical research is nonexistent and thus the content minimal.  Virtually no real images of Waffen SS troops. An absolutely horrid product. If I could give negative stars (-) below zero I would have done so.,1287187200,4,364,5.169491525423729
8066893,5,B0009UVBS6,"This DVD is a good, though not in-depth, overview of the Waffen SS during World War Two.  It has some good footage, and is quite interesting.  It makes a good addition to my collection.  I have many other DVD's produced by The War Zone, and have not been disappointed.",1239062400,2,268,4.428571428571429
8066894,1,B0009UVBS6,"They should be sued for saying it is a colour production, it is not. The only colour is on the cover, along with the photos that have nothing to do with the Waffen-SS. I could go on and on about the errors but why waste my time and yours? Whatever you do, don't waste your hard or otherwise earned money on this rubbish. Honestly, after over 60 years since the end of the war, and we still get stuff like this. I couldn't even sell it after I'd watched it, I ended up giving it away.

A disgrace!",1173052800,20,496,4.061224489795919
8066895,1,B0009UVBS6,"All I had to do was take a look at the jacket to formulate an opinion.
Two of the photo's are from WWI ( both widely familiar ), left to right, an infantry advance in Flanders, circa 1917, and the remains of a German skeletal corpse in the aftermath of Verdun 1916. The third photo is of a torch-light victory  extravaganza, that were commonly held throughout 1933.
This is how the producers of this junk present their "" product.""
But inside, in 60 minutes, they are going to broaden your horizon on the subject of the Waffen SS. Sure!
Avoid this kind of throw-away. If the conjurers' of this stuff can't even locate a real Waffen SS action photo for their cover ( which afterall is the beginning of attracting your money ),do you trust them to say something expanding inside?",1156204800,75,776,4.50354609929078
8066896,3,B0009UVBS6,The product is ok but I wish it had subtitles and/or the option of languages other than english.,1152489600,3,96,4.388888888888889
