2701584,3,B000LC3IF6,"I enjoy Conan O'Brien (Coco, for those cool cats out there). I have been watching him for years, and I was excited to get in on this action.

My major complaint is the length...it is FAR too short. I was expecting more clips, more fun and just...more.

The production values were on par with his show, which is enjoyable. I guess for 68 cents, this is a good hour or so of enjoyment.

Long live Coco!

2701585,5,B000LC3IF6,Couldn't rate it higher but Conan's show was a classic and the extras are a must have.  The Triumph alone is worth it.  WOW this is funny.,1287878400,,138,4.074074074074074
2701586,5,B000LC3IF6,"The anniversary special is just as great as I remember it! There's also an easter egg in there somewhere. I agree with previous reviews that Triumph's DVD is a bit short, but it's still totally worth the price.",1268697600,,210,4.552631578947368

2701588,5,B000LC3IF6,Both of them are very funny. I think Comic's DVD is too short though. I loved it when he was making fun of the Starwars geeks and brought in the Startrek guy. I love Conan's shows and the 10th Anniversary was extremely funny. I recommend this it may be short but is worth the money.,1265155200,,282,4.1454545454545455
2701589,5,B000LC3IF6,I like to think that Arnold's character was based on the ultimate lineage of the brave and honorable Conan of Brien (O'Brien) ... someday he will rule the galaxy,1251590400,,161,4.586206896551724

8160688,1,B000LC3IF6,"This is what I did that I did not want to talk about with anyone.  So I went to Christ.  In 2003, I wanted to be a comedian and writer.  I worked on sketches with my younger sister.  Eventually, I found an FAQ online for Late Night with Conan O'Brien that said emails to funnyontv@aol.com would be answered by a ""talent coordinator,"" but instead I was blocked.  I view that as false inducement.  Yet, I took that as a ""no.""  I focused on moving on and self-improvement.
Nonetheless, the stolen material was directly and indirectly used, including the signature joke of his 10th anniversary special in which he said he was ""that jackass who comes on after Leno,"" which was ripped from my line that he was ""that delightful weird guy who comes on after Leno.""  I was never obsessed with Conan O'Brien but I took rejection as new direction to focus on self-improvement.  Frankly, I would study late night comedy and I thought Jay Leno had the best monologues, David Letterman had the best interviews, and OBrien lowered the bar by doing weird shit that he calls silliness, while his interviews were comically awkward but that awkwardness creates a tension that is funny, which he calls, self-deprecation.  Even so, he got by with likability from the coat-tails of The Simpsons.
Nonetheless, O'Brien was clearly fishing for messages that he could call ""bizarre,"" and to stockpile material that could be indirectly or indirectly used in the event of a writers strike, like the one in 2008.  For a celebrity, getting a ""bizarre"" message is like winning the lottery because they can tell all their friends that some stalker thinks they are interesting and that the fan is obsessed, which often inspires creativity that is used for TV shows and movies.  The gift that keeps on giving ... for a talk show host whose show was regularly on the brink of cancellation but could suddenly tell all his social circles that he's onto ""something,"" which can create the clout needed to secure lucrative deals, royalties, and contracts.  I would note that the reason he was dumped as host of The Tonight Show is because the execs were starting to doubt the loyalty of his fans and ability to get ratings.

Yet, it has been clear to me that my pursuit of happiness has continued to be attacked by malicious behavior from media professionals and celebrities because I was maliciously attacked on MSNBC by Keith Olbermann in 2009 when I was a sports blogger for The Bleacher Report.  Eventually, BR was bought by O'Brien's employer TBS and banned me from publishing.  But again, I moved on yet that's when I drank the Kool Aid at the church in Aptos.  I moved on by taking classes at ComedySportz in San Jose but I did not advance in 2014 and I have suspected that it's related to O'Brien because ComedySportz has connections with The Groundlings in Los Angeles, which is an improv group that O'Brien has been associated with.

I decided to write this because I'm wondering if there are extenuating circumstances where I could pursue criminal charges against O'Brien.  But I realize the complexities of this.  At the time of the original event, I lived in Soquel and he was a talk show host in New York.  Which state has jurisdiction or would it be Federal?  I'm wondering that because, under New York law, the crime would be robbery in the 2nd degree because the act likely involved more than one person and because the item robbed does not necessarily need to have value and can be something like a photo album.  I have sent a message to NYPD about this but I doubt that I will hear back.  I would assume that OBrien still has possession of the stolen material and that he made statements to law enforcement to trespass me, even as a tourist.  I would also say that under New York law, it was aggravated harassment to maliciously use the airwaves as a weapon by using what he knew I would know was my material.  While the value of the material is mostly personal to me, I would argue that by maliciously inducing messages that he could call ""bizarre"" (which were influenced by his sense of humor) he wanted something that would enhance his reputation among colleagues to suggest that he could garner ratings and ad money, which means that, the value of the material would exceed 1 million, which is possession of stolen property in the 1st degree.

So maybe now you can see why I have been wrongly troubled and confused from a malicious act and from that, I have caused distress to people.  Thanks.",1488585600,,4476,4.653113087674714

I'm a fan of Conan and Triumph and I was really looking forward to watching these at some point.  Needless to say I don't think I'd try ordering it a third time.  I might opt for the individual disc versions instead.",1415923200,,349,4.596774193548387
8160693,5,B000LC3IF6,"Okay, the tenth anniversary was good and all (there were some pretty cool things about Conan's stuff, if you don't hold anyone in particular reverence). The real reason I got it was to watch Triumph the insult dog. I was not disappointed, either. There is absolutely NOTHING off limits to this commentary on civil society, and I must say they've all got it coming ... sammy",1410480000,,373,4.666666666666667
