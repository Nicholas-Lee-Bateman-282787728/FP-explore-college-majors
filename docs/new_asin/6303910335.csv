I could not belive how I felt after seeing it by myself, and that's when I decided to use it to come out. It was a total success with my mom and I, It clarified all of her missconceptions, and made an already good relationship with her, into a Great one!
Please rent or buy this informative video, it's for your own peace of mind. It saved me lots of therapy sessions.",1064016000,3,596,4.146551724137931

This video gives you the rare chance to fully understand a subject thats not considered polite conversation. A heaven send for lost parents. The finest Question and Answer video on the market. This tape should be in every school. If you are 17 or 71 years old and want to better understand, this is the ticket. If you are a parent who needs answers, buy this video.",1047427200,3,497,4.595505617977528

Growing Up Gay and Lesbian is one of my best education videos in my video library. I highly recommend viewing by parents, teachers, preachers, students and anyone wanting to be edudcated on this issue.
I have used this video in a number of workshops addressing anti-gay climate in schools.
