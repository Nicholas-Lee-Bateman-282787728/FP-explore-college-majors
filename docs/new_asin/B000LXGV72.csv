8165224,4,B000LXGV72,A deep and thought provoking story line. Hard to believe that the producers and director put this film together with the small amount of money they used. Very good production.,1314921600,,175,4.866666666666666
8165225,5,B000LXGV72,"This is an incredibly beautifully told and photographed story of one mans search for his past and meaning to his life. Good for the whole family. Great for those who are tired of all the blood and gore, sex and violence in most of todays films. A profound story told simply and beautifully.",1174435200,,290,4.490566037735849
