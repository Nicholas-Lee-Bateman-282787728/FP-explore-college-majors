8535475,5,B0093ZH51U,So the basic content is what paranormal evidence average people have captured. It ranges from photos to video evidence & some of it is astounding. One episode covers the blue angel at the convenience store but Im pretty sure that got debunked as being an insect on the security cameras. I enjoy paranormal shows and I just hope they release more on dvd as we didn't get the next series in Australia. I found the 2nd disc jaw dropping and even if it is fake its very entertaining & certainly thought provoking,1363392000,2,508,4.532608695652174
