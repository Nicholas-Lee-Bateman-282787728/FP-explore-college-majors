8341649,5,B001TIAU0C,This is one wacky ass wheelchair ride. I couldn't begin to tell you the plot of this movie. Other than a bunch of insane people who love movies trying to make one with no money. You should see this one on a double feature with Las Vegas Blood Bath. No good kills to speak of but its still a must see. Thanks God for YouTube who somehow is able to play some of these rare videos that you cant find or you cant afford. Hyapatia Lee is incredible and this is just a quirky one of a kind SOS classic that you will never forget. Dink O'Neal is hilarious and all the stars are unforgettable. I'm rambling but that's what Hellroller makes you do! Watch it now by any means necessary.,1462406400,,676,4.1679389312977095
8341650,5,B001TIAU0C,"I spent 6 years looking for this movie to buy. I'll have to say it was worth all the effort. It's a really crazy low budget movie about a disabled serial killer. It's a gory good fun little movie. The character Eugene is quite a strange character, who likes to attacks ladies in the shower. The whole movie has a shot on VHS look. Picture quality is pretty rough, but I think it suits this kind of movie. The music in this movie was pretty weird as well. The whole movie is just different from others I've seen. I've never seen anything like it before. If you can find a copy it's worth a look. One of those so bad it's good kind of horror movies. It's one hell of a ride.",1374624000,,672,4.098484848484849
