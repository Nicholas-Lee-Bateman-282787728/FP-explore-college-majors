3503381,5,B001C0JRLU,"In the Family is powerful and poignant at the same time. It is an effective documentary about the human dimension of genetic testing, its complexities and effects. Through forceful images and moving stories of women that could very easily be you or me, filmmaker Rudnick explores the multi-faceted implications of testing for mutations. I highly recommend this film, and applaud Kartemquin for yet another effective social critique.",1277856000,3,432,5.462686567164179
3503382,5,B001C0JRLU,"I am brca1+ and I was very moved by this documentary.  Anyone BRCA+ or thinking about being tested should see this. I have also had all of my closest friends and family watch this, it explains it better than I can. Highly recommended.",1227657600,4,234,4.441860465116279

8285438,4,B001C0JRLU,The explanation of the BRCA mutated gene was impeccable. Loved it. It would be nice to see a part II that gives an update on Mrs. Rudnicks life now and to mention any new found BRCA studies.,1445558400,,190,4.162162162162162
8285439,4,B001C0JRLU,"This is a timely documentary, but its frustrating. The woman has the BRCA gene, and yet shes holding out for kids before getting body parts removed. After the doc was filmed, she did have 2 kids - and she got BC. I think they caught it early, but I felt it was so silly of her to put her life at risk. Anyway, interesting.",1443139200,,322,4.046875

8285442,5,B001C0JRLU,"An important movie. Women with the BRCA 1 or 2 gene have to consider prophylactic treatments in order to survive - the statistics tell us that 85% to 90% of women [and men] who possess this gene will get breast cancer and 50% will get ovarian cancer.
I found this film hopeful, because the women that chose prophylactic mastectomy lowered there chance of getting breast cancer to 1% - lower than the general population - and most had breast reconstructions, which looked GORGEOUS.
The movie director ]who has the gene mutation] kept putting off these procedures, and subsequently developed breast cancer. She's had all the treatments - chemo, etc. After reading about her, she seemed angry with herself for not taking action sooner.
This film treats this gently, sensitively, kindly. The interviews are moving and if you're listening to the speakers, you learn.
Great film.",1415318400,2,873,5.027586206896552
8285443,5,B001C0JRLU,"Why I'm not sure I'm on board with every single point and fact of this movie, it was very eye-opening and informative.  A very educational movie and a must see for anyone with any family history of breast cancer.",1401667200,,212,4.435897435897436
