8313408,5,B001JPIGW4,"Grandes Pealas #17.  Great fights once agian. You will be treated to an excellent exibition of boxing by the great Wilfredo Gomez when as he knocks Jaun Laporte silly for 12 rounds. One of gomez's best performances in my opinion. You will also be treated to one of the hardest right hooks any batamweight ever threw when you see Juan Manuel Lopez in action. Then one of my Favorites Felix Trinadad Takes on two time middleweight tittlest William Joppy(i won't say champion because i believe Hopkins held that position and was the true champion.)Then you will get to see a strawweight fight fight that doesn't really get started till the 8th or 9th round featuring Ivan Calderon. All fights are in english being called by Jim Lampley,Larry ""if i was 20 years younger"" Merchant,Emanual Stewart,and Roy Jones. Gomez fight is called by the fight doctor Ferdie Pachecho. P.S. Speaking of William Joppy, i wish Duran could have beat him two years earlier I have a feeling Duran wasn't in great shape for that fight. That would have been awesome if Duran could have won the Middleweight tittle at age 48.",1342828800,,1097,4.773684210526316
