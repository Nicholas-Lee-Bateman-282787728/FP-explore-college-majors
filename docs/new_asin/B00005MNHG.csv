7946073,2,B00005MNHG,"I would not waste my money on this, even for $5 you would be paying too much. I am not new to exercise, but I am new to trying to incorporate stretching into my life. This nice lady, who was/is obviously a dancer, has graceful moves but she doesn't give much in the way of instruction or what you should be feeling. Just goes into it and you're like, ""Whoa, so am I supposed to start or is she just showing us a nice little routine and then she'll explain and have us follow it?"" No, you just start moving trying to follow her continuous movements and feeling a bit silly.  Also, it is insanely short to me, someone said 8 minutes? That sounds right. Seemed like 5. It does feel nice but I finished it, wondering if I'd done what I was supposed to, wondering if there was more coming (there wasn't) and VERY glad all I did was check this out for free at the library. I would describe this tape as a lovely waste of money if you buy it. It was lovely in a way but I found it mostly useless.",1281571200,3,989,4.0717948717948715
7946074,1,B00005MNHG,"Ann Smith is a lovely older woman who is obviously in great shape, but I am not.  I am a senior in terrible shape and needed something I could use at home to help me get on the right track.  For reasons I won't go into, I have lived a sedentary live for some time now and hoped her tape would get me started in the right direction.  The tape just seems more of an opportunity for Ann Smith to show off and make me feel even more hopeless.  I have tried the gyms and have my own set of difficulties and really believed stretching was the right approach for me  I still do, but I need someone to start me out at the very BEGINNING and step by step go from there.  This tape was such a waste of money and such a sad disappointment.  I was so excited and then so terribly let down.  Patricia",1260576000,2,787,3.968152866242038
