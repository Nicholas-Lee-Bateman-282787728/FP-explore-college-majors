3504698,2,B001C4CI8U,"I watched the second episode immediately after the pilot on TiVO just to make sure the it was as bad as I thought.

The cast does a great job with what they are given, but that makes it all the more difficult to watch. As written the show is a mash-up of X-files, CSI and countless conspiracy/shadow govt shows. And while the Fringe of the title refers to Fringe Science, there is little science involved.

A show so similar to others should come with its own mythology and should stick to the ""science"" it lays out. That is what allows suspension of disbelief. Instead there is a collection of set-pieces with no coherence--a cow is requested for testing apparently for the comic shot of cow being walked down a crowded university hallway; later, when a translucent FBI agent's body is wheeled into the lab, we can only assume he also had to come down the same hallway???? And that FBI agent, initially kept in isolation, body super-cooled, is later laid-out in an open lab, the only cooling apparatus a beer-chiller pack covering his nasty bits.

There is much more wrong, but suffice it say the cast is to be admired, the writers fired.",1221782400,7,1139,4.600985221674877
3504699,5,B001C4CI8U,"The bar was set high for Fringe after the impressive pilot, and the second episode only builds on the excitement millions have already latched onto. The opening scenes of the first episode were gruesome and intense to be sure, but nothing compared to what we get in the first four minutes of round two. Witnessing a woman conceive, carry a baby full term, and deliver via C-section all in the span of a few minutes is every bit as shocking as you might imagine. The doctors' and nurses' reactions in surgery, mixed with the groaning (yes groaning) of the newborn work together to give us one of the most chilling scenes in network TV history. It's almost as if the writers are saying, ""Guess what? This show is intense and no telling what we will throw at you next!""

Early on I was quite surprised to see Broyles meeting with a select group of higher ups as he introduced his new team. Who was among that group? None other than the Terminator arm toting Massive Dynamic COO Nina Sharp herself. I can't wait to see how this relationship plays out as more light is shed on The Pattern and all who are involved in it. Massive Dynamic CEO William Bell is yet to be seen and I don't expect we will see him for awhile. The creators of Fringe have even said in a recent podcast that the actor they have cast as Bell doesn't even know he is playing Bell. Whatever that means....

I loved the story in this episode, and especially the mix of ""fringe science"" and investigative techniques used to track down the killer. While these unorthodox methods are incredibly far-fetched, I still can't help but buy into the ""what if"" factor. This is a formula we can be sure to expect in each new installment and I'm excited to see the creative ideas the writers have in store for us.

The strong characters we fell in love with in the pilot are in top form throughout this episode. Olivia Dunham's infectious search for truth is captivating and inviting. John Noble continues to give a stellar performance as the highly eccentric Dr. Bishop. This is a truly disturbed and damaged character that tugs at our heart strings all the while amazing us with his superior intellect. The biggest surprise for me so far has to be Joshua Jackson's performance as Peter Bell. Jackson gives this character the perfect balance of humor, wit, and compassion that make Peter so engaging. At the end of the episode we see a softer, yet welcome side to Peter as he sings his father to sleep.

The relationship between Peter and Walter is one of the most interesting aspects of the show, and it looks like things just became even more interesting. I had my suspicions in the pilot that all was not as it seemed between father and son. For instance, something about the way Walter kept trying to check Peter's vitals throughout the episode seemed especially odd. In The Same Old Story there is one very interesting scene where Walter shares information with Olivia about Peter's past and the nature of their relationship. My guess? I wouldn't be surprised to find out that Peter is much more than Walter's son....more like his creation.

So many questions. So many theories. And alas, this is only the second episode! I am so, so hooked...",1221782400,8,3202,4.590909090909091
3504700,5,B001C4CI8U,"In 2001, when a little show called Alias hit the airwaves, I was instantly hooked on the creative genius that is J.J. Abrams. Since Alias, Abrams has become a household name for TV and Film geeks worldwide with such gems as Lost, Mission Impossible 3, and Cloverfield under his belt. For months now Fox has been brainwashing its viewers with promos of Abrams's newest TV creation, Fringe. With a reported $10,000,000 spent on the pilot alone, not to mention the eye-catching ""from the creators of Lost"" tagline, expectations have certainly been high for fans and critics alike. Would it, could it possibly live up to the hype? This past Tuesday was our chance to find out.

Episode Synopsis:

When an international flight lands at Boston's Logan Airport and there are no signs of life, FBI Special Agent Olivia Dunham, a scientist, Walter Bishop, and his son Peter uncover a deadly mystery involving a series of unbelievable events. ([...])

Right out of the gate, the Fringe pilot makes a strong case for being worthy of all the preceding hype. J.J. Abrams' formula for success is all over this thing and it works:

1. A seemingly unknown female lead that will undoubtedly be turned into a star? Check. Australian actress Anna Torv is perfectly cast as FBI Agent Olivia Dunham. She has the strong screen presence and subtle charm needed to be able to carry this series.

2. A somewhat has been actor that will no doubt be reinvented into a rising star? Check. Joshua Jackson (aka Pacey) wooed teen girls for years on the 90's WB sensation, Dawson's Creek. Here he gets a fresh new start as Peter Bishop, genius estranged son of Dr. Walter Bishop. I was pleasantly surprised with the depth of Jackson's performance and the welcome comedy relief he brings to the show.

3. A mega supporting cast? Check. John Noble plays the role of the eccentric, yet endearing Dr. Walter Bishop. I could almost here Middle Earth nerds celebrating worldwide as they realized this is the guy who played Denethor, Steward of Gondor in Lord of the Rings: Return of the King (OK, yeah, I was celebrating, too). Truly, some of the funniest and most engaging scenes are between Walter and Peter Bishop. That's a relationship that I can't wait to see further explored on the show.

Lance Reddick (aka as Matthew Abaddon from Lost) brings a welcome mysterious air to the character of Philip Broyles. We find out early on that he works for Homeland Security, but before the episode's end we can't help but wonder who this guy really is.

Kirk Acevedo, Mark Valley, Blair Brown, and Jasika Nicole also bring strong supporting performances to this well rounded cast.

4. An underlying conspiracy that will only become more mysterious and vague as the show goes on? Check. J.J. Abrams has stated publicly that Fringe will be unlike Lost and Alias in that we will not have to watch every episode to follow the story.  I will believe that when I see it. The introduction to ""The Pattern"" toward the end of the episode seems to hint at an underlying mythology for the series. ""The Pattern"" is sure to be discussed, analyzed, and mulled over to the extent of the ""Dharma Initiative"". What is The Pattern exactly? I don't know and neither do you. That is why we will be back for more. Some may consider this an annoying storytelling device, but I love my TV shows served up complex and mind boggling. Bring it on J.J.!!

Fringe is all about exploring fringe science (teleportation, invisibility, time travel, telepathy, etc, etc.). This is where the X-Files feel of the show comes in to play (thankfully J.J. Abrams has also said the show will stay away from aliens). The first scene of the pilot is a shocking and gruesome foreshadowing of what we can expect each week. And what a way to kick off a series! Who doesn't enjoy watching skin falling off of someone's face at 30,000 feet?

There were some other subtle touches that I enjoyed from this first episode. The cinematography was breathtaking throughout and if you haven't watched this show in High Definition you are truly missing out! The special effects were top notch and I especially enjoyed the translucent skin one of the characters was afflicted with. The location subtitles for each scene were very innovative. Much like the titles for each new Heroes episode, the location subtitles were imbedded in really cool places throughout the pilot. This is sure to become a unique Fringe trademark that adds a little more creative depth to the show. The mysterious Massive Dynamic Corporation, the yet to be seen CEO William Bell, and COO Nina Sharp's Terminator-like arm were also intriguing additions to the plot. Indeed a viral Fringe website for Massive Dynamic has already launched.

No doubt Lost fans are going to be looking under every nook and cranny for connections between the two series. Interestingly enough, the new autopilot system used to land the plane in this episode is referred to as the Pearl System. Maybe a not so subtle nod to Lost's Pearl Station? Although I didn't notice, there are reports online that a few of the infamous Lost numbers make appearances throughout the pilot. While I enjoy such shenanigans, I do hope this is nothing more than J.J. Abrams being all cutesy for his Lost fans. If we find out somewhere down the line that Fringe and Lost are interconnected I think my feeble brain will explode.

The only thing working against Fringe is its home on Fox, which has an awful track record of canning great TV shows prematurely. Fans of shows such as Firefly and Drive know exactly what I'm talking about. The buzz and promos certainly lean in the show's favor, but with Fox no show is ever safe. Although I'm sure Fox has already renewed Hole in the Wall for eight seasons. I would love to have seen ABC pick up Fringe and scheduled it next to Lost each week.

I was very impressed with the Fringe pilot and afterwards my wife and I shared that look that can only say, ""We've found yet another show to be addicted to"". Great writing, strong acting, and an intriguing plot are sure to keep us coming back for more. The great twist at the end of the episode gives us a taste of the strong storytelling that is sure to come with each new installment. If you missed the premiere you still have a chance to catch up. Sunday, September 14th, Fox will be replaying the pilot at 8/7 central with a preview of the new 24 movie coming in November. You can also watch the pilot in glorious HD at Fox's website.",1221091200,51,6462,4.686067019400353

3504795,5,B001C4CI8U,"For anybody who was watched this they will agree with this synopsis. I have a feeling that this was story boarded in a much different timeline. I would've had this start with the main character Olivia Dunham as a little girl for the first couple of episodes or maybe just one. It would have made several of the later season episodes unnecessary. Some of the back story flashback episodes took up too much storytelling time that would not have been needed to be used at the first season had these episodes in them. But executives at the network One-A-Day slamdunk action-packed episode for the pilot episode, and I'm sure that the producers were talked into this. This does not make this series unwatchable. Quite the contrary. This first season does not get to the need or the heart of the whole series premise so be patient the best will get to reveal itself in seasons two, three and four. Not an exact clone of the X-Files which dealt with aliens but awful darn close. If you're an X-Files fan this is definitely right up your alley. A must watch but be patient. Seasons two and three are by far the best.",1506988800,,1108,4.517412935323383

It does not matter what device I play it on either.  I love the show and want the rest of them, but have been hesitant to purchase for that very reason.  Season One was the same way.

The purpose of this show is not to investigate sexism in the workplace and the overwrought performances in this first episode are hardly appealing.
But then the series starts to zero in on its real subject matter - sci-fi and the paranormal - very rapidly, cleansing its characters of their initial, irritating idiosyncrasies, instead assembling a very solid ensemble cast whose quirks serve to humanize them.  The show is, at times, a little hard to follow - cases emerge and are attributed to ""The Pattern"" but the reference is often dropped from future episodes until a handy explanation is needed again.  This, though, is hardly unique.  ""The X-Files"" often worked the same way but I would stop the comparison here.  If nothing else, the attacks on 9/11 split the two series from each other.  ""Fringe"" involves itself almost entirely with some kind of terrorism, from wherever it may be.

Overall intriguing and engaging...
Yet Many things about the story and plot are developing too slowly and inconsistently. Threads are lost suggesting improvised plotting... Walter character is not well developed as his continuous divergent comments on food and stuff are not funny after a while...  Peter character is underutilized and Olivia over played.  Many elements of the story and plot are totally inconsistent and unlikely.

But that isn't making sense to me, because I have gotten wellinto season 2 and clearly they can always stick in a stand-alone episode whenever they please.  Also there was a complaint about the acting ability of the female protagonist.  I don't buy that either because at the very least, she was probably picked so that just by being herself, she fits the role nicely.  And if she is indeed acting differently than her normal self, then she is a fine actress.  She conveys a grounded-ness that keeps me with the show even when it gets too formulaic and repetitive and let's-up-the-ratings-with-some-novel-grossness.

So I think what really keeps me coming back is a few characters who are very easy to like, and the attempt to wring every last ounce of excitement possible out of the world of science by throwing in some fun pseudo-science.",1472774400,,1015,4.636871508379889

3505156,5,B001C4CI8U,"Wonderful story with great meaning and a good ending. Sometimes it is a little too drawn out so you may start getting bored. I almost gave up on the series but then the science just keeps getting better so it kept me intrigued. The suspense and mystery and plot twists just keep building and getting better also so just hang in there. As the series progresses, the characters become so deep and realistic. Anna Torv is a great actress.",1472428800,,435,4.518987341772152

3505159,4,B001C4CI8U,"I have watched the show in the past, but never got to see all episodes. The overall theme of secret experiments, types and idea of multiple universes is absolutely fascinating. It is very easy to imagine they could be real.

I enjoy the scientific explanations of the experiments; they lend the concepts more credibility. Viewers really have to pay attention to not miss hidden clues or a tiny moment.
The symbols they show, e.g. the hand, frog, etc. are actually a cypher. Pretty neat. You may find yourself getting sucked in because you want to know what's next.

Love Leonard Nimoy in the role of William Bell. Perfect actor for the character.

I would give it 5 stars, but a few episodes I find a bit cheesy; not really cohesive with the other episodes.",1472428800,,757,4.634328358208955

But that's not the only thing this show is about. Its about heart, about the love of family and what a love can overcome. Its about sacrifice for the love of family in the face of world  destruction. The first season isn't the best but by the end of the 1st season this show takes off and never looks back. Fringe takes you on an emotional ride. It will make you laugh and it will make you cry from S1 ep1 thru the 5th and the final ep.",1471824000,,590,4.042735042735043

3505177,4,B001C4CI8U,Not bad.  The writing could be better.  They could start with giving Olivia a more stable personality.  It doesn't seem like the writers can agree on whether she should be a strong person or a whiny little __.  It's also a shame they made Mark Valley's character dead so fast.  He could read the phone book and I would be happy to watch and listen.,1471392000,,348,4.292307692307692

3505181,3,B001C4CI8U,"Seriously, can the contrived drama just go away? The series features a powerful female figure, who is always breaking down and followed by stupid drama. She is supported by a father son team with loads of contrived drama to try and explain their bizarre behavior and depths of knowledge. When in doubt the writers toss hurdles at the characters for more contrived drama rather than developing their crypto cases.

When the show does stay on track and get down to crypto and pseudo science it has some promise. In a season and a half it is no match for the X Files, but honestly it seems unfair to compare this soap opera with a solid mystery series.

Even after my complaints it has been decent. I am a season and a half in and still slogging forward.",1470787200,,751,4.474452554744525

After starting from the beginning, I like the series even more than before. I don't remember too much, but enough to be excited as they introduce elements that I know are significant later on.

3505321,3,B001C4CI8U,"There are story problems.  The protagonists are using cell phones without being caught even though the world has been invaded by a superior breed of humans who would certainly take over the systems that are already in place.  If you ever use Waze you are hooked into a system that knows where you are within a few yards.  I'm at an episode where they hope to stop future deliveries of atmosphere changing technology.  Why not attack the ones that are already in place?  They keep showing how Central Park has been turned into a CO machine.  1 or 2 episodes ago one of the guys takes a gun out of a hide where his dead daughter had also stored some nice chunks of C4- enough to blow the CO machine to smithereens.  They also have a grenade launcher that launches anti-matter grenades, which could take out the CO machine.  The amber thing is inconsistent.  Early on they instantly get people out of amber, but when they come to the lab they have to spend hours and hours melting the amber away.  Will I watch more episodes?  Maybe not.  I think they should take some lessons from James Cameron on meticulous story development.",1467676800,,1125,4.514851485148514

Each cast member injects his own unique personality which provides the viewer with an appreciation of that multidimensional character. The biological and medical pseudoscience props show fine imagination to the point that they seem both logical and realistic.

3505362,5,B001C4CI8U,"Forget about worrying if the plot is plausible or implausible. You only need to focus on two words: John Noble. Before watching this show, I didn't know of John Noble, the Australian actor who plays the ""mad"" scientist, among other roles. He is simply a great, mesmerizing actor, full of wit, nuance, charm, heart and intelligence. He's also a very physical actor, able to ""tell"" his characters with wonderfully subtle gestures and expressions. I have watched the entire series through twice, and I don't think I will ever tire of his performance.

That being said, I also liked the rest of Fringe. The actors are all good, if not great. The story lines are generally good, with maybe a tad too heavy emphasis on icky skin eruptions during the first season. The arc story is fascinating. It does improve with age. I'm not a big fan of J.J. Abrams: the L.A.-style pretty people, the schmaltz, the xian savior themes that pop up out of nowhere, the obsession with broken father-son relationships. But here, it all feels a bit more real, and the obsessions are working for the show, not against it. One of my all-time faves, and for Orphan Black fans out there, definitely one of the precursors.",1466467200,8,1192,4.730769230769231

3505418,3,B001C4CI8U,"This law enforcement/super detective/ sci-fi mix is mild entertaining, though extremely far fetched.  The lead actress is very likable and carries the role well, while the other characters support her pivotal 'super FBI' role.  The biggest character flaw is the part of the wacky scientist who is not believable as he is too demented and happens to know all of the 'weird' science that they encounter.  There are a couple of love interests for the lead, but they do no provide the needed tension, likely as one is dead early on (and gone finally) and the other just seems to stick around for no real good reason, considering his background.  This 'second' guy seems to care 'mildly' for the lead, but not really more than any of the other characters, so no tension or connection developed yet.  It is also time to build the re-occurring characters (the team), to realistically make Torv's character more a part of the team, as she not so 'super' that she can do it all by herself.  Can't fly:not 'superwoman'.  I will likely start season 2 to see if it improves beyond mildly entertaining or whacky sci-fi or I won't last through the entire 100 episodes.",1464307200,,1154,4.711442786069652

3505442,4,B001C4CI8U,"Definitely one of the more watchable things on Amaxon however you have to really suspend belief as each role in the series is super formulaic.

While watching this show you can almost hear the writers in a meeting room:

Well it should be a strong sensitive smart female protagonist. Because it is all about female protagonists now. There needs to be a love interest but he can not be there to distract us from how strong she is so kill him in episode two but bring him back as a mind ghost.
Add a mad professor and his son bro-fessor who rolls his eyes at everything and is mildly an outlaw turned good guy but may leave any time kind of guy, he should have a sweet boyish face so it is a contradiction. Add a black guy as the dude in charge so we cover race diversity.

Every show should start with an incident much like Buffy, x files, six feet under and then it should be explained or semi tidily wrapped up in the end of an episode while developing the larger story slower than molasses.

Have an evil corporation that seems to be actually helping but isn't.

Have terrorism cause it is topical.

Have human testing cause that's topical too.

.... This is GMO version of storylines, it is so engineered to perfection it has lost all the joys of storytelling. So by catering to every weakness of 21st century tv addicts and studying every urge, it fails to be memorable or noteworthy in the grand scheme of tv, movies, literature and history.",1463184000,3,1446,4.413533834586466
3505443,5,B001C4CI8U,I missed this series when it first came out.  The story captivates you and takes you to places you never could imagine.  I love this series!,1463184000,,140,4.346153846153846
3505444,5,B001C4CI8U,"Real Science Fiction instead of ""cowboys in space""  .  The characters are all distinct and varied.  It is nice to see a variety of ages and not just ""pretty faces"" as characters.  The plot to each story is standalone, but I recommend watching from the beginning because the characters develop so significantly through out the season (and throughout the entire series).  Some episodes are quirky. Some are sinister.  Some are humorous.  And the MUSIC IS GREAT. If someone published an album (like a soundtrack of Fringe) it would be a best seller.  OK, if you are an actual scientist you will argue with the premises in some of the stories.  Remember, this is why it is called FRINGE, after all.",1463184000,,694,4.716666666666667
3505445,5,B001C4CI8U,"Fun Sci-Fi series. Intriguing story line

3505447,5,B001C4CI8U,"Fantastic! Incredible characters and casting. Great writing and venues. The stories are made to be plausible by explaining enough science background. Of course if you are looking to pick apart the lab work don't bother watching. The show is a roller coaster of sci fi theory and consequences. But it is the characters that make me want to see the next episode. Each one has flaws which make them interesting and vulnerable, that offer insights into their psyche as the show progresses. The cast is a solid team whose growth and resiliance to adversity is challenged and developed well in each episode. Dr Bishop and his son Peter  have brilliant minds which I enthusiastically enjoy because they possess a level of intelligence rarely seen in today's media broadcasts. How refreshing to see smart embraced and science exploited with both predictable and unpredictable results. If you insist on remaing grounded in reality, the havoc created may be unbearable but watching for pure enjoyment and challenging the imagination, the show far exceeds a simply enjoyable experience.",1463184000,,1075,5.17816091954023
3505448,5,B001C4CI8U,Fringe is a great sci fi series. After watching the Torchwood series I wanted more. Fringe supplies that quite easily. I give the series 5 stars. Great choice Amazon.,1463184000,,166,4.758620689655173
