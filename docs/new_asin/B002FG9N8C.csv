8369018,1,B002FG9N8C,"Horrible!  I just wanted to see Blue summer which I saw on Netflix, but they had other really bad movies added to the package and porn like movie trailers.  It is really tasteless and grotesque. These people have no business being naked in movies.  You may need a puke bowl after watching some of  these movies.  The movies would probably be R-rated in these day and age, but it was still insipid nudity, acting, and plots.",1415577600,,423,4.5131578947368425
8369019,1,B002FG9N8C,If you're looking for comedy or any T&A on this collection you won't find it. Stay away from it. However if you enjoy teen dramedys and silly goffy 70's retro flicks then this is probbaly for you.,1335657600,2,196,4.324324324324325
8369020,3,B002FG9N8C,"I originally purchased this 2 DVD collection to see ""Sometimes Sweet Susan"" (1975)(which I was waaaaaaaay too young to see when it was first released), & despite being an edited soft core version of a hardcore flick, it was't too bad. Of the four movies, ""Blue Summer""(1973) was probably the most entertaining...that's not to say I wanna see it every year after eating Thanksgiving dinner..

The other two films: ""Teenage Divorce"" (1972) & ""Summer School Teachers"" (1974) were both pretty bland, bad & outdated; not just technically, but also socially; the dialogue in various scenes is downright goofy, insulting and so absurd that I often found myself laughing at parts that weren't supposed to be funny (and not in an MST3K kind of way).. But it's interesting to note that ""Teenage Divorce"" features Mr. George Takei in a rather flamboyant role; decades before officially coming out... Okay, actually, he's the ONLY reason to see this one..

""Summer School Teachers"" seems to be a discarded & rather worn New World Pictures print, and after just 20 mins in, one can tell why Roger Corman wouldn't want to release this one himself under his ""Roger Corman's Classics"" label.. This is the only one of the four that I just couldn't get through...a classic it ain't....

Honestly, none of these titles are worthy of the ""classic"" label, which is why I call them almost forgotten sexploitation cinema movies.

So, if you're a fan of bad 70's drive-in sexploitation, or a fan of people with dirty feet having sex, or early Showtime or Cinemax after hours fare; this collection is a must have for you!! However, if you're looking for hot str8 porn or looking for art house or movies containing an ounce of substance or intellect; then definitely save your money and pass on this set.

P.S. The DVD also comes with an interesting liner notes booklet - OOOOOOOOOh.... Peace!",1327795200,7,1867,4.8769716088328074
