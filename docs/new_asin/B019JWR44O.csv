8745426,5,B019JWR44O,I didn't care for this movie on the first viewing but liked it much better the second time around. Its a good story about a musical partnership having its ups and downs. I was taken aback by one scene where Sarah got so mad. It was strange seeing my sweet Sarah like that even though it was just acting.,1458086400,,303,4.1525423728813555
