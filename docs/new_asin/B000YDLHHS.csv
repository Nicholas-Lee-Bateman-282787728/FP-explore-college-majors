3026269,5,B000YDLHHS,"The video wasn't an in depth documentary, but i was grateful for what had been made.  I think we went far too long saying far too little about OUR people and OUR contributions in every conflict.  Considering our history with the United States and newcomers, i think most would've expected us to turn a blind eye. However, we have a culture of warriors, love of our homeland, way of life and our families too. It's shameful there were so many people unwilling to acknowledge and appreciate that at the time.",1378252800,7,506,4.611111111111111
3026270,5,B000YDLHHS,This was an excellent and balanced presentation of who the Code Talkers were and how they were instrumental in helping us win the war in the Pacific. Well worth watching about another element of WW2 history that was unknown until a few years ago. (Another WW2 piece of history that has only fairly recently become well known and honored is the Tuskegee Airmen.) Watch True Whispers and enjoy.,1376870400,4,392,4.779411764705882
3026271,5,B000YDLHHS,This was a brief recap of the gallantry of group of people who gave their all for an America that was never really square dealing with them. It is the story of pride of purpose and individual dignity when faced with a challenge.,1367107200,3,228,4.325581395348837
3026272,3,B000YDLHHS,"True Whispers is a generally solid if unimaginative chronicle of how young Navajo US Marine Corps recruits assisted in developing a code language to support US military efforts in the Pacific Theatre of World War II. Special emphasis is given to the long campaign on the tiny island of Iwo Jima where a number of ""Code Talkers"" were wounded or killed during the cave-to-cave battles to defeat the ""hold until death"" Japanese defenders.

True Whispers opens with the history of unjust Navajo treatment by the US Government, starting with the administration of Pres. Andrew Johnson, including attempts at assimilation by forcibly removing Navajo children from their families to inculcate them with the ""white man's ways."" The film climaxes with a long-overdue recognition ceremony from the US government in 2001, where 4 surviving Code Talkers are recognized by Pres. George W. Bush in a ceremony in the US Capital. Gale Anne Hurd and Cherokee film and banking entrepreneur Valerie Red-Horse produced True Whispers in 2002 via their Valhalla Motion Pictures company, with funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. It was screened on PBS stations nationwide in 2003 and 2004, and released as a DVD in 2007.

The dedication of the filmmakers is evident throughout, though the film plods steadily to its conclusion with a 4th of July parade on the Navajo reservation, led by Navajo war veterans, as the credits roll. The film is most effective when the veterans, their wives and families speak personally in ""head shots,"" but this tends to toward static set pieces of information here and there, slowing down the flow of the narrative. Numerous audio tributes from US senators and representatives are interspersed throughout the film, set against black and white stills from WWII with the congressperson identified with a caption in typewriter style text at the base of the screen. This prosaic device soon becomes predictable, repetitive and tiresome, as the testimony of the Navajo corpsmen themselves is far more effective.

In conclusion, True Whispers is an honorable and respectable effort to recognize Navajo Marines and their role in WWII, as well as offering some valuable insights into Navajo culture.",1348444800,5,2218,5.224719101123595
3026273,2,B000YDLHHS,"This documentary has some excellent interviews with the actual Navajo code talkers. However, the narration that accompanies the interviews is full of basic factual errors (e.g., the ancestors of the Navajo were not the Anasazi; Philip Johnston did not, by his own account, get the idea of using code talkers from the World War I Choctaw or Comanche; the U.S. military did not create increasingly complex codes in response to an elite group of English-speaking Japanese code breakers; the code was not kept top secret for 20 years (it was featured in a movie in the 1950s), etc.).
