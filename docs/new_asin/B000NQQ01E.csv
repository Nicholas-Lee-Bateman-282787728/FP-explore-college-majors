8180743,2,B000NQQ01E,"I wanted to find a DVD to share with our family and friends about foster adoption.  I was excited to find this DVD.  However, once I watched it I was very disappointed.  The description said that it showed a family doing a foster adoption but it did not.  The first family had decided to adopt from Russia after going through infertility treatment.  The second family did not have infertility issues and they do a private U.S. adoption but not a foster adoption.  The first story is very good, we will probably just show our family that part of the DVD.  Foster adoption as an option is left out of this DVD.  For those interested a foster adoption is usually free to very little cost and is where parents adopt a child out of the foster care system in which case the child has been taken away from their family and put up for adoption by the state.  Birth families have no rights to their child once a judge dissolves parental rights.",1209513600,,935,4.421052631578948
