4209293,4,B003VIWSA8,Love all the Jesse Stone movies with Tom Selleck--this is all the movies in one package--fabulous!,1288656000,,98,5.1875
4209294,5,B003VIWSA8,These are some of the best Tom Selleck shows that he made. I love Tom Selleck and watch him as often as possible and on these shows he does a great job as a cop.,1288396800,,161,3.6285714285714286
4209295,5,B003VIWSA8,Exactly as described.  Nice series with the excellent acting of Tom Selleck.  A must for all collectors.,1286928000,,104,5.0588235294117645
4209296,5,B003VIWSA8,"When I ordered this dvd collection, I was expecting inferior quality, both audio and video. I was very pleasantly surprised to find the quality to be excellent. The price was much lower than any other place - even eBay! Great price and very fast shipping, so in the future, I will check with this seller first before purchasing.",1286841600,3,328,4.672413793103448

4209298,5,B003VIWSA8,"I've always been a Tom Selleck fan, so I ordered these just to see if I liked any of them.  What a treat.  A more mature (and interesting) Tom Selleck in a beautifully photographed and directed series.  The plots are interesting and the acting and directing a bit slower paced than what you typically see any more.  It is a pleasure to watch them and I am hoping for more.",1286841600,,372,4.271428571428571
4209299,3,B003VIWSA8,"This Jesse Stone Collection has the following six movies:

- No Remorse
- Thin Ice
- Stone Cold
- Sea Change
- Night Passage
- Death in Paradise

Tom Selleck, as Jesse Stone, was a good selection as an actor, and I encourage the reader to read the reviews for the individual movies.  For this set, however, the price really isn't better than buying the movies individually.  I'm surprised at this.  I literally got a shrink-wrapped package of the six individual movies.

Again, I enjoyed the movies.  I just expected there to be something special in a ""collection,"" especially price-wise.",1285372800,63,588,4.82

Devane (ex-cop, alcohol addiction counselor, and ""shrink""), Kohl Sudduth, William Sadler--a great bad guy, and Saul Rubinek (""I'm very fond of you, Jesse""). You don't have to have the entire set to follow them but they do build on the previous ones. I own them all and sincerely hope the franchise is continued as long as there are Robert Parker novels to make them about..",1360713600,,531,4.911111111111111

4209342,4,B003VIWSA8,"Be aware that the order of the TV ""films"" has a slight bump -- the second is actually a prequel to the first, so you can watch them knowing that. Dates in parentheses indicate airing dates on CBS.(Wikipedia ""Jesse Stone (character) is source.

 1.  Jesse Stone: Stone Cold (February 20, 2005)
 2.  Jesse Stone: Night Passage (January 15, 2006) a prequel to Stone Cold
 3.  Jesse Stone: Death in Paradise (April 30, 2006)
 4.  Jesse Stone: Sea Change (May 22, 2007)
 5.  Jesse Stone: Thin Ice (March 1, 2009)
 6.  Jesse Stone: No Remorse (May 9, 2010)

There are two more episodes NOT in this 6-pack:

 7.  Jesse Stone: Innocents Lost (May 22, 2011)
 8.  Jesse Stone: Benefit of the Doubt (May 20, 2012)

More films may be made, as Tom Selleck loves this character and plays it straight from the books. If you are interested in the books, check out the bibliography by Robert B. Parker, and carried on by Michael Brandman after Parker died.
I find it fascinating to watch this character, Jesse Stone, so completely unlike Spenser of Spenser for Hire fame.",1360022400,,1054,4.594594594594595
4209343,2,B003VIWSA8,"I do like 5 of the seven Jessie Stone DVDs  No Remorse and Thin Ice will not play on our DVD player.  All the others are fine.

4209346,1,B003VIWSA8,"It could be my fault but I'm not all that sure. The DVDs are for zone 1 and I live in zone 2, where I ordered them. Obviously I didn't realize this until I tried to watch the first DVD so no returning the set!

4209349,5,B003VIWSA8,"Excellent movies.  There is a story line that continues throughout the series but each movie can stand alone.  You can relate to all the characters, some favorably and some you love to dislike.",1357171200,,193,4.818181818181818

4209356,5,B003VIWSA8,"Saw these episodes on TV and wanted to have them avaiable to view at will, and to loan to others.

Good stories. Might be Selleck's best role.

He is the chief of police of a small New England town. The city fathers do not like him because he won't wear a uniform, preferring casual apparel, like jeans and a baseball cap. His staff of 3 are sincerely dedicated, quiet and intelligent, The crimes are typical small townish, but there is something going on that involves outsiders. He's an independent and resourceful experienced cop who came from the west coast seeking an environment where he could make a difference. The scenery and surroundings are moody and quiet. He has a failed marriage that haunts him, a minor drinking problem, and an adopted dog that disapproves of his drinking with mournful stares. He has no telephone at his cabin and his cell phone reception is unreliable, which occassionally requires a staff member to bring news of duty calling.

No car chases, no shoot-outs, just good stories and characters,

Highly recommended.",1355702400,,1048,4.870786516853933

4209375,5,B003VIWSA8,"All nicely done with good production values. The first one, Night Passage is good but you can see that Tom Selleck is just getting into the role. Faithful to Bob Parker's crisp/spare/wry dialogue, but don't expect the book in film form. There are cuts and changes as needed but still good stories. Shot on location in Nova Scotia. That was smart... beautiful! Good value and worth every penny.",1321488000,9,393,4.794117647058823
4209376,1,B003VIWSA8,"When I received the DVDs listed I was looking forward to spending an evening watching them with my daughter.  After opening for first of the series and settling down with a glass of wine the evening went downhill from there.  The DVD skipped, tiled and jumped so much that we were unable to continue.  Rather than opening the remaining DVDs I returned the entire series for a refund.  I may try another source in the future but not anytime soon.",1320624000,4,445,4.525
4209377,4,B003VIWSA8,"I would like to receive a new DVD of Robert B. Parker's ""Jesse Stone: Death in Paradise"" as it was purchased as a gift for someone and arrived with the DVD cracked, so it is unusable.

Otherwise the stories are interesting and my husband loves them.",1320278400,,249,4.413043478260869
4209378,4,B003VIWSA8,"Having never read any of Parker's books, Stone Cold was
quite a pleasant surprise. Somehow I felt serene among
the quiet hardships and overall morose atmosphere that
pervades each subsequent scene, something that director
Robert Harmon truly has a knack for capturing.

I found that there was a mild relation to Stone's loneliness
and embittered past, and an unwavering solicitousness
for his semi-controlled drunkenness, as glass by glass
by glass by glass had gone by. An engrossing story and
character-driven series that left me anticipating the
next release.

On my way home from the liquor store one dreary, rainy
night, thirsting from my recently acquired taste for Scotch,
I swerved into the video store to pick up the latest Stone
drama. And let me tell ya, a letdown it is not. It's chock
full of the quips, awkward interactions and quirky
characters that we Stone fans have come to love.

Though the books stopped with Parker's passing, Selleck and
team haven't. In the latter sequels the directors have also
changed, but my trusty glass hasn't. And sure enough, Stone
reluctantly seeks help from his witty psychiatrist time and
again. It really is comforting to see him putting forth the
effort.

So, I recently checked myself into AA where I attempted to
overcome my unquenchable thirst for Scotch; that, and my
newly-formed habit of speaking to people in a roundabout
caustic manner, which I can tell you really vexes those
among the group, especially the chain smoking team leader.
Oh, and I've been threatened several times with restraining
orders. I mean, jeez, just `cause a lonely guy hints at a
sex-filled 1st date w/o the strings, the dominantly
attractive women get all bent out of shape. Oh well, a
Cassanova I am not.

Well, anyway, I've successfully transcended my problem,
been ridin' the wagon awhile now down that bumpy road and
I pray that Stone can one day do the same.

And now, for some reason, I can't stop drinking coffee...

4209379,5,B003VIWSA8,We bought the entire selection of these really great murder mysteries. We actually watched them over just 2 days. It is nice to sit & watch one right after the other so you can see what started the episodes. We have been dealing with Amazon for years and never had any kind of a problem!!  Well done.,1314662400,,300,4.2631578947368425

I like these books and my dad likes these books so I feel the money on these movies was perfectly spent.

4209382,5,B003VIWSA8,"The Jesse Stone collection is great. Not only is this a perfect role for Tom Selleck, but a great story line in each case as well. When I first heard Tom was to play this role I wasn't so sure. I liked Magnum PI, but this is a much different type of role. Once we started watching these shows, I was was positive this was made for him. Then I heard about the books it was more amazing how well Tom fits this role. I understand the author has recently passed. I hope there will be many more of these shows. After all look what they've done with Ian Fleming! My wife wasn't too crazy about Tom, but this role has turned her around, he is perfect in this role. The only problem with getting them on DVD is that it's over too soon!",1304380800,4,727,4.055555555555555

I have been a Tom Selleck fan forever as I can always count on his talent, class and integrity with any project he does.  I have also been a Robert Parker fan for many years and was surprised that I had not heard of the Jesse Stone Collection before.  Robert Parker was the creater and writer of the Spencer for Hire series as well, and I thoroughly enjoyed that and found that his writing was just as wonderful in the Jesse Stone series.  From what I understand the Jesse Stone Collection is shown on a paid network so that was the end of that mystery.  Now that I know about this Collection, I will be watching for the next movie that will be coming out on DVD or Blue Ray in 2011. You will not be disappointed with the incredibly talented cast in this series.",1298073600,2,857,4.364779874213837

Saw some of them on TV but missed a few and my husband never stays up late enough to watch so got it for us for Christmas. Watched Stone Cold last night and had not seen that one. We really enjoyed it, as I'm sure will be the same with the others. Selleck is perfect in the roll of Jesse and the other characters are all interesting as well. The interaction between them and Jesse with the small bits of dry humor throughout makes for a very entertaining movie.
