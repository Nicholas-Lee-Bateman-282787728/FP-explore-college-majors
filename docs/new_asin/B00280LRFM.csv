8355342,1,B00280LRFM,"Nothing really good to say about this besides the story was somewhat touching. Although I'm not sure what it had to do with the expedition.
B.D. Wong as the narrarator does nothing to excite. The imagery shot doesnt do justive to the Siberian landscape. The ""leader"" of this expedition lets his kayak blow into the river on the 2nd day not to be restored. So he hikes the rest of the way. I want to feel bad for him but at the same time, don't lave your kayak unattended right next to the river with class 5 rapids. Just dont, i think that is the only valuable lesson from this all.
Hopefully Vadim is still alive. In the beginning they mention this expedition is to raise money for this kid. Never explaining why or how. They only tell us in the end that he gets released from the hospital before Christmas.
Do not waste your money on this. if You have HULU and a sick kid at home, watch it on your day off if you want to kill an hour.",1396915200,,936,4.176795580110498
