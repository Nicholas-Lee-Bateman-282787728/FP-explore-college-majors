5076723,5,B007C60FDM,"Loved this little gem - three deeply personal stories of loneliness that manage to be authentic and resonant without ever being depressing or melodramatic. A masterpiece of tone. If you're the type of person who enjoys a good drama but ultimately always reaches for a comedy - this is the movie for you. Tons of heart, with plenty of great, funny moments. Highly recommended.",1335830400,14,375,4.875
5076724,5,B007C60FDM,I loved this movie. Harry Chase is genius in it. It is so uncomfortable and comfortable at the exact same time. Really enjoyed it.,1335571200,2,130,4.458333333333333
5076725,5,B007C60FDM,"I saw Hello Lonesome at the Los Angeles Film Festival and LOVED it.  It's by far one of the best independent films I've seen in years- charming, funny, surprising. Definitely check it out.",1335571200,2,188,4.696969696969697
5076726,5,B007C60FDM,"I first saw this independent feature at a film festival in Washington.  I was absolutely blown away by the story, the performances, the directing...the film as a whole.  Not to sound like an old man, but so many films are all flash and no substance.  Story is replaced by action and character development is nothing more than dialogue in the middle of a car chase.  Hello Lonesome, takes its time and unfolds in a truly beautiful manner.  (Each story is a blend of laughter, sadness and absurdity.)

By the end of the film, you feel like you have not only gone on a journey but have really gotten to know the people intimately.  It's also an odd feeling when you think back on the film and realize that the entire cast is small enough to fit into a large minivan.

The director manages to hit the perfect tone of light and dark in these three stories, without falling into the pitfalls of ""obvious choices"".

I suggest you get this film, sit back and just enjoy the journey.",1335484800,10,974,4.4576271186440675

5076730,5,B007C60FDM,"Life, even under sad or horrible circumstances, has the ability to somehow be charming and sweet.  When you're at your worst, its other great people that bring to back towards your best, or to make you try and mend your mistakes.  I got all of this from Adam Reid's film.  The characters, to me, became likeable despite the flaws that they have.  You sympathize with them.  I hoped that Bill would receive his wake up call and try to improve his behavior, that Debby would remain happy in her relationship with Gordon even when she receives grave news, that Eleanor would find some companionship in her new friendship with her neighbor: I was taken along their path and eager to see how it all panned out.  The ending came smoothly and worked really well.  Each character had some quality that I've seen before in different people that I've met, and it made the film even more genuine.

I loved it and would see it again.  Happiness is always worth a try, and we're all the better for it.",1334102400,6,988,4.50561797752809

5076733,5,B007C60FDM,"As a 50-year-old woman I really appreciated the stories about people aging as gracefully as possible and the ways they manage loneliness by connecting with others. Lynn Cohen (Magda from Sex and the City) is one of my favorite actresses. She was wonderful and funny as a woman who befriends her 40-something neighbor, which was my favorite of the stories. Second favorite was the middle-aged divorced man who does voice-overs. This slice-of-life movie was so satisfying I watched it twice.

5076741,4,B007C60FDM,"Three stories provide variation on the theme of loneliness. The subplots don't intersect; they're conveyed  more as parallel storylines. A very wacky and talented Bill (Harry Chase) performs commercial voiceover in his home sound studio. We learn he has a history of considerably inappropriate behavior. His wife has left. He tries to reconnect with his daughter, who won't accept his calls, plays with an array of outdoor toys, in addition to a rifle, has a quickie one-night stand, and befriends a great character, Omar (Kamel Boutros), his delivery man, who sings opera. Chase does a stupendous job, and Boutros, with a smaller role, is terrific.  Another interesting, younger pair meets on social media, falls into sex, then love, and faces some serious adversity- well played by Sabrina Lloyd  and Nate Smith. A third pairing is an 80ish widow, played expertly by Lynn Cohen, who misses her independence ( the DMV confiscated her license)-- but not as much as she misses cuddling-- and a much younger slightly cynical, divorced neighbor, solidly performed by James Urbaniak. Adam Reid wrote the screenplay, directed, and filmed. Bravo to you, Adam Reid!  The film is smart and funny, the humor clever and the right degree of sardonic. All filmmaking disciplines are deftly united. A universal theme, well executed.  Recommend.",1481500800,2,1331,5.200934579439252
5076742,3,B007C60FDM,"This was a series of scenarios involving a few people. By and large it was not that exciting but helped show how some cope with living alone or being alone. An older person befriends a young person, a work at home announcer befriends others though liking his lifestyle. It has some humor but the movie seemed aimless to me. It gets credit for the acting and some of the scenes but you are left wondering about what you are watching. That might seem boring but I did find that it held my interest. The longer you watch the more you keep watching just to see how it turns out. It is sad in a way when you realize these people have very little human companionship but then they seem to survive in their own ways. Watch it to see how the characters live in their world. It is a slice of a way of life that some find themselves living.",1481155200,,830,4.19375

5076757,5,B007C60FDM,"So many reviews, so little time.

With only an hour and a half to kill before an international flight, I decided to search for something out of the ordinary to not just simply pass the time, but also feel engaged.

Bang.  This wonderful film came up and I'm so happy to have watched it.  Writing, directing and (very much) the acting were all spot on.  Easily, I felt a connection with every character.  Even the cinematography during the beginning credits was a delightful surprise, and continued throughout the film.

This was altogether so good, I plan on watching this again ... encircled with a small group of Lonesome Souls.  Being constantly surrounded by people doesn't exclude one from sometimes feeling very lonely.  This film does a brilliant job of making it clear that we humans can all experience these feelings.  Recognizing them and then taking action to overcome them may be the ultimate answer.",1453507200,7,912,4.863636363636363

5076766,4,B007C60FDM,"Funny, poignant, thoughtful. The three story-threads offer different takes on the human desire (need) to connect with others.

This is a somewhat quirky movie (in a good way!), canny about its subject, and ultimately affirming, despite (or because of) the knotty situations it displays.",1440547200,2,390,5.516666666666667

Anyway, back to Hello Lonesome--what drama, what sadness, what good humor in this movie. How sweet the relationship between the young, divorced copyeditor and the old widow. Externally, so different, but the internally the same--lonely. Longing, loneliness are in your face in this movie and as prescriptions, unconventional alliances are made and bulls eye honesty is expressed in order to cope with it.

5076786,4,B007C60FDM,"""Hello Lonesome (2010 release; 93 min.) brings the story of a number of lonesome folks in a non-descript town and its suburbs. As the movie opens, we get to know Bill, an older guy who we see doing voice-over work from home for movie trailers, radio spots and the like. Oh and he walks around in just his underwear. We learn that Bills wife has recently left him, and man, is he ever lonely. By chance, Bill strikes up conversation, and eventually a friendship, with the mail delivery guy. We also get to know an older lady named Eleanor who is having car issues and looks for help to her neighbor. And on and on. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, youll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the feature length debut of writer-director Adam Reid. He does a great job portraying the loneliness that seems to prevail with so many people, even if they are not alone. In that sense, the movie is hardly a feel-good movie. On the contrary, even though much of the movie is brought in a quirky and off-kilter fashion, I doubt anyone will walk away from this thinking that was a jolly good time. The acting performances are generally speaking top-notch, none more so that the two lead performers, Harry Chase (as Bill), who has an uncanny resemblance to Rutger Hauer (the Dutch actor who broke through in Hollywood in the 80s), and Lynn Cohen as Eleanor. This movie was originally released in 2010 and played mostly at festivals and the like, until foreign and indie-film distributor Film Movement picked it up and released it on DVD in 2012.

As is always the case with a Film Movement release, there is a bonus shortie, and Film Movement cleverly gives us While the Widow Is Away (2005 release; 19 min.), which is the very first movie from writer-director Adam Reid. And Lynn Cohen is here also one of the two lead performers (as the widow). Nice bonus shortie that is definitely worth checking out as well.",1412812800,3,1965,4.548022598870056
5076787,3,B007C60FDM,We've seen people fall in love and then face hardship.  We've seen an isolated older and younger friend keep each other company.

5076788,5,B007C60FDM,"This beautiful film reminds me of a short poem by Philip Larkin:

The Mower

The mower stalled, twice; kneeling, I found
A hedgehog jammed up against the blades,
Killed. It had been in the long grass.

I had seen it before, and even fed it, once.
Now I had mauled its unobtrusive world
Unmendably. Burial was no help:

Next morning I got up and it did not.
The first day after a death, the new absence
Is always the same; we should be careful

Of each other, we should be kind

That said, I found this a sweet film with some poignant moments. The theme is hardly subtle: loneliness; which in certain vignettes turns into desperation. In all but one of the characters, the loneliness, and aloneness, is palpable; a driving force towards resolution.

8514214,3,B007C60FDM,"Well, this was a mixed bag. Three separate stories are oddly edited together in this very indie film. I didn't buy into the young couple's love story at all--and with good reason. But it did make me realize how pathetic it is when some people are just desperate to be with anyone rather than alone. The story about the voice-over artist was mildly interesting, but I didn't really get the point of it.

On the other hand, I adored the story of the older woman and her younger male neighbor. The time spent was worth it to me for that story alone. It was well acted and tastefully done.

In fact, most of the acting was good except that of the young online dater. He was pretty lame, but that may just have been his character.

If you're alone and/or lonely, your life is probably pretty slow-paced, so the slow pace of the movie won't bother you. If you can't relate to lonesomeness, you probably won't appreciate this flick very much.",1493337600,,935,4.456140350877193
