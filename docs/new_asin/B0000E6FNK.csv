1936848,5,B0000E6FNK,"Very rarely can you find a film that honors silence and true pace. Movie-goers have been spoiled in recent years with films that spell it all out. ""Wicked Spring"" causes you to sit back and relish what time was really like during the Civil War era. Very unique to this film is the first ten minutes. These first ten minutes have caused a great deal of conversation. But what viewers do not realize is that without saying a word, Mr. Hershberger eases the viewer into the past...into an era that was slow and contemplative. The imagery is magnificent. The war is harsh and realistic.
At the heart of Wicked Spring beats the issue of the human condition. Six men meet and transform because of war, because of circumstance, because of survival.
I believe this movie is a ""must see"". The soundtrack is beautiful as well. To the director...Congratulations on making a beautiful movie on your own terms.",1066521600,16,897,4.719745222929936

1936885,2,B0000E6FNK,"This could have been a good film if 30% of it was cut out. It was to long for the subject matter. Most of the acting was good but a few actors over played their parts and compromised the film giving it a 'cheese' feel. The beginning was drawn out and lost it's emotional value with a belabored and redundant opening sequence. Again, the actors did a fine job but because of the redundant and stretched out beginning, I lost interest after 5 min's. It's a shame, this could have been good.

The story itself is also very good, and has a taste of Ambrose Bierce in it's flavor.  If you know Bierce's work, you'll understand, once you watch the film.  You must know however, that as convincing as the actors look, their performance seems to be that of drama students and not seasoned actors.  I did enjoy the film, but the acting is like that of actors who are on stage, and studying the trade.

I watched it with my son, who is not a big Civil War buff like me, and he liked it. I look forward to buying another movie directed by this person. I wish that there were more directors making Civil War films shot in this same fashion.... good photography...

1936912,5,B0000E6FNK,"What would've been REALLY good with this movie is some English captioning. I mean, really, you're going to offer SPANISH subtitles to a movie where Americans were involved fighting other Americans?

I've always been fascinated by the Wilderness campaign that was fought in Virginia in 2 days of May, 1864, fought in 70 square miles of shrubs and trees and brush that had previously shed the blood of 13,000 Confederates and 16,000 Yankees in the Chancellorsville fighting exactly one year earlier, and then causing another 11,000 Confederates and 17,600 Yankees to be killed or wounded in this same area. But I've barely been able to put a description to the fighting until this movie came out, and I had to wait a hell of a long time to order it because the price was too high. 80 BUCKS for a single DVD? So I waited until it was below $5 before ordering.

The story centers around 6 different men, Yankees and Confederates, who have somehow survived 3 years of bloody fighting, so while their regiments tear each other to pieces in the close-hand fighting, these men wander through the woods at night and come across each other, finally deciding after some hesitation to sit down, have a meal, and talk to each other about their lives, never seeming to know that each group of 3 men is actually from the opposing side. I mean, REALLY? You can't detect their uniform color around the campfire or their different accents? I would've taken a star down for that, but as the movie continued, I realized that the men didn't really seem to care how the other looked or sounded, because they all had the same kinds of hopes and dreams that they shared with each other.

Then BAM...the daylight comes and the men wake up to realize who the others really are. It looks like quite a standoff for a while, the other side threatening to take the others captive, but then the fighting breaks out among the six men and who will survive? None of them apparently, as they find out that the Yankee and Confederate troops are fighting each other again on the second day of battle, and since they're caught BETWEEN the opposing lines, all six men eventually end up being killed, mostly from the volleys of gunfire being exchanged from both armies.

Kind of a sad ending, but brilliant descriptions of the battle were put into this movie! So in the end, it deserved 5 stars for the creativity that was put into the scenes. Very excellent!",1315526400,6,2419,4.631701631701632
1936913,5,B0000E6FNK,"As a former reenactor and history buff the accuracy of this flick is top notch. The horror of battle is well portrayed as well as all the uniforms, accoutrements and weapons. The by-play of the characters is well done. I was actually angry with the main character for awhile and then realized I had been fully drawn into his dilema. Well done--huzzah!

Battle scenes are excellent. A lot of work went into creating the battle scenes in this indie movie. Many types of emotions are depicted (bravery, confusion, empathy, sadness, cowardice, leadership, fear, pain). Battle sound effects were impressive.
Period clothing and equipment
Focus on ordinary soldiers, not generals
Confusion of battle
Negative
Low budget look and feel. Pharaoh's Army was completed on a budget of $500,000. Wicked Spring has a much more amateur-ish look.
Improbable plot that the soldiers didn't know they were in different armies. In ""A Midnight Clear"", the Germans want to surrender and the Americans want to help them, but things go wrong. A different plot could have been the Union soldiers want the Rebels to help them get the wounded soldier back to a surgeon.

1936936,2,B0000E6FNK,"I love this period of history, have read hundreds of books on the subject, etc. etc. Other complaints aside, this film is just poorly written. We are supposed to believe that there were no literate soldiers in the Southern army! C'mon, the poor guy had to carry those letters around for three years waiting for someone to read them because no one in the Confederate army could read? This is just silly, and the idea that these men couldn't tell they were with soldiers from the other side? I really wish I could give this film a good review, as there  few and far between movies made on the war between the states, and good ones are really rare. Obviously this pleased many, and I'm prepared to take all the unhelpful votes from fans to warn others. Try Pharoah's Army, a truely outstanding indie pick of this time period, which while slow on action, tells a much more realistic story.",1265068800,5,885,4.53125
1936937,4,B0000E6FNK,"As an avid lover of Civil War films, i must say that ""Wicked Spring"" manages, in a few key scenes, to deliver one of the best depictions of Civil War close combat in any other film out there!
Fantastic casting and performances.  At moments, chilling.",1249171200,,250,4.555555555555555
1936938,3,B0000E6FNK,"I recently bought a DVD copy of ""Wicked Spring"", mainly based on the many favorable reviews I read on this site. Began looking after thoroughly loving another little-known Indie Civil War film, ""Pharaoh's Army"" (1995, starring Chris Cooper and Patricia Clarkson in the lead roles). The reviews on this site for ""Wicked Spring"" sounded similar, so I bought a copy and watched it for the first time the other night.

Quick take: in no way as good a movie as ""Pharaoh's Army""(in every respect- acting, plot, cinematography, pacing, etc), but still an above-average Civil War movie, so long as you understand that, like ""Pharaoh's Army"", it is not meant to be a grand epic filled with big battle scenes, but a small slice of the Civil War, from the personal level of a few grunt soldiers struggling through a few days of that massive conflict.

The story in ""Wicked Spring"" is simple enough: during the horrible 1864 battle of The Wilderness (around Chancellorsville, Virginia), 6 soldiers (3 from each side) wind up being thrown together in the darkness of one night, following a confused day of fighting and running around lost in the dense woods and general chaos that was the battle of The Wilderness. The initial scenes of the fighting are done well enough, though without a whole lot of sheer-terror or graphic violence (read any historical accounts of the real battle and you'll realize how toned-down the movie depiction is). The 6 men spend the night together, largely lost and afraid, and clearly (with the exception of one Confederate soldier) not anxious to hurt anyone anytime soon. The bulk of the movie revolves around conversation between the two lead actors during that night ( Yankee D.J. Perry and Reb Brian Merrick), with the most revealing part of that being a series of letters from Merrick's sweetheart back home, which are caringly read to him by Perry, as the Reb is illiterate, and has held the letters for 3 years without being able to read their content. The two leads actors do a passing job of acting, though this is very subdued material, and not a whole lot of content about the Civil War or it's tensions, but just generic wishing-for-home material that is common to all soldiers, during all wars. The supporting cast, however, is simply awful: particulalrly the angry Reb (Terry Jernigan) whose over-the-top routine gets old pretty fast. In all fairness, the supporting actors really aren't given anything too interesting to say, but even so, their acting is pretty bad, even for an Indie film. Not fair to compare this aspect to ""Pharaoh""s Army"" , with two major motion picture stars taking the leads in that one (as well as an excellent supporting cast of lesser-known actors), but just be prepared to wince and even yawn a little off and on during ""Wicked Spring"". The issue about whether the soldiers recognize early on that they are on different sides or not seemed fairly obvious to me: I understood their words and actions to mean they knew, but just didn't want to deal with it for that particualr night. That is, until the Jernigan character acts like it was a revelation the next morning that he has spent the night with 3 Yankees- this part just didn't make sense to me. The eventual climax the next morning seemed all too predictable to me, and for that reason it lost a lot of the intended dramatic impact. When the movie ended, I wasn't blown away or left with any lasting impressions, as I certainly was with ""Pharaoh's Army"". My usual way to critically assess any movie is whether or not I will watch it several times after the first viewing: I might watch ""Wicked Spring"" again, but I have watched ""Pharaoh's Army"" many times over the last couple of years. Enough said.

The cinematography in this flick is pretty good, and the attention to detail in the soldiers uniforms and gear is first-rate: Civil War buffs will notice this aspect, but I doubt it will mean much to the average viewer. The musical score is at times quite moving and beautiful, and never detracts from any scene.

Overall I give it 3 stars, mainly for the attention to Civil War details and the two lead actors work. I suspect it will appeal to Civil War buffs primarily, though, and for most others, probably a once-viewed flick without much lasting impact. But no way is it either just one star or 5 stars: folks who rate it that way are way too biased, one way or the other.

Needless to say, I'm a Civil War buff. But if you haven't done so already, check out ""Pharaoh's Army""- a real gem, in every way.",1231113600,2,4525,4.693954659949622
1936939,4,B0000E6FNK,"Many people seem to be missing the point of this excellent indie production.  This is NOT meant to be some action-filled, war epic.  But rather, a thoughtful, small-scale film, focusing on a small group of men from both sides of the Civil War.  I've seen a number of reviews saying how far-fetched the plot was - nonsense!  It's a known fact that Union & Confederate soldiers often met during lulls in the fighting to exchange supplies and swap stories. Who's to say that something along the lines of this movie didn't happen!  At any rate, rather than focusing on battle scenes, instead it focuses on individual soldiers and what was going on in their own lives.  The opening 10 minutes of the movie says so much with no dialogue, sets up the story, and is quite moving.  A very good film, worth watching and thinking on, despite the downbeat ending.",1227484800,,851,4.633333333333334
1936940,1,B0000E6FNK,"This is most likely the worst movie I have ever seen. It's a pity, because I have a particularly strong interest in the battle of the Wilderness.  I can't tell you how disappointed I was watching this film.
Intensely boring with indiscernable dialogue, I bet even the cast falls asleep when they watch this film. Directed by Kevin R Hershberger and produced by mistake. Please don't waste your time.",1227484800,6,399,4.782608695652174
1936941,5,B0000E6FNK,"This movie is perhaps one of the most realistic depictions of the plain soldiering life of the foot soldier.  There isn't any glamour and the men are just presented as plain men.  The beginning was actually well done, and while there wasn't any talking at the very beginning; it was so well done that we didn't notice it.  The  music was pleasant all throughout.  I thought the exchange between the yankee soldier and the Confederate soldier with the letters was especially touching.  The ending is not the typical happy ending or romanticized ending that movies usually have, but rather it has a tragic and probably more realistic ending than most war movies.  There is some swearing, but mostly the milder swear words and for the most part it is a pretty clean movie.  I was pleasantly surprised as all the acting was well done.  (Which isn't typical in indie films.)  It is a movie that I would recommend to anyone.",1215216000,2,918,4.68125

1936956,3,B0000E6FNK,"Before I saw this movie, I asked four personal friends of mine who are extreme Civil War buffs what they thought of it. Three thought it was the worst movie ever made, and one thought is was pretty good. The one who liked it offered to bring it over - which he did - and we watched it together.
The first fifteen minutes or so shows mainly the two main characters - one from the north, and one from the south - with their sweetheart and wife. Life before the war.
The second part shows them three years down the road, the war in full force, and our characters are fighting in the Battle of the Wilderness. This depiction of the battle was excellent. I would put it against any major motion picture Civil War battle for authenticity, it's that good. Very realistic in the sounds department - lots of screaming wounded and yelling about. Truly authentic.
The third part of the movie shows our two heroes, as well as a couple of their comrades, lost and, through a series of circumstances, enjoying each other's company under the darkness of night, neither side fully realizing they are in the company of the enemy.
Is this story line far-fetched? Probably, but not impossible. If you pay attention to the dialogue (especially as the letters are read), you will figure out that the Yank puts two and two together and knows who his new friends are.
Not a bad concept, more like a what if? rather than historically accurate.
Speaking of accuracy, the clothing - military and civilian - are as perfect as I have seen on film. Kudos is deserved for that alone!
As for the acting, well, it's OK for the most part, but there are a couple of scenes where the acting is abysmal at best, especially in a particular scene during the battle where the messenger is speaking to the general. Simply awful. Thank God there are only a couple lines.
The rest of the cast does a fairly decent job.
So, to sum it up: 5 stars for accuracy and authenticity, 5 stars for the battle, 3 stars for the majority of the actor's quality, 1 star for the messenger and general's acting ability (or lack thereof), 3 stars for the story, and 3 stars for the script. I figure my total to be a 3 or maybe a 3.5 score - not too bad when you think about it. Let's put it this way - after watching it, I ordered myself a copy. So, although it's not great, it's not the pits either.
As a whole, it's not bad at all. I agree with the one friend who liked it over the three that did not.",1192579200,13,2444,4.315217391304348
1936957,5,B0000E6FNK,"I am Very Proud of my Southern family and Heritage, and watched this movie with an air of defense as usual...at first. Then the awful reality of pain and fear set in.  The begining shows the quiet truth of the family they had to leave to go fight for their country. THAT IS WHY THEY LEFT. As the movie continues, my heart ached for them all. It was so real, that it brought me to tears. All I could do was vasalate through a host of emotions. It brings home the realities of the devestating war in a very grafic and real way. I am sure this may have happened, and it leaves the viewer with a real sence of questioning in thier minds. It should be required viewing for all teens. As a reenactor myself, and a member of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, I would recomend it for the realisim factor alone. But the accuracy of this really happening to me is questionable. Loyalties were very strong, and I can't see them all together as buddy's at night, then against each other in the morning?

1936959,2,B0000E6FNK,"This movie could have been great, if there was more of an effort reality in the dialogue. The dialogue is a complete mess, I have been a civil war buff all my life, I've been a reenactor since I was 13 (portraying both sides), I have read every first hand account written by those soldiers that I could get my hands on. Some of these guys may have been illiterate, but they were not stupid, especially the seasoned veterans whom the two main characters are suppose to be. Its extremely hard to believe that they would have been able to go through a full night, especially on the field of battle, completely oblivious to the fact that they are sharing a camp fire with the enemy. It's amazing that through their whole night conversing that none of these strangers asked the other simply ""what unit are you with?"" or even picking up on the others accents.  Even if they had known that they were enemies, the overall storyline could have still stayed intact, since it is well known that friendly exchanges between confederate and union soldiers did occur somewhat frequently outside of combat (although there would have to be some tweaking to Terry Jernigan character). Conversation dialogue for most (not all) is just simply cheesy.

Now for a few positives. The uniforms and equipment were very well researched and authentic. The battle scene in the beginning was very impressive.

1936961,5,B0000E6FNK,"In the dark woods of the Wilderness, lost Civil War soldiers blunder together and spend the night sheltering from the battle.

I liked a lot of things about this movie -- the way that a small number of participants were made to look like whole armies by using terrain (rather than just marching the same guys back and forth past the camera the way small-budget historical films often do); the realism of the battle and battle-aftermath scenes; the appealing, quirky and ultimately doomed characters; the lack of anything immediately noticeable as anachronistic. The film held my attention throughout and I found its conclusion both moving and thematically appropriate.

I wondered why the characters didn't figure out each other's allegiance until dawn (accents wouldn't help? Or the fact that the one guy had coffee and the other tobacco?). And I also question something I see over and over in Civil War movies: no one believes in what he's fighting for. Particularly Southerners. They're all just sort of innocent farm boys who are there because, apparently, they were too dumb to know better. Historically accurate film ought to portray the range of motivations that actuated Civil War soldiers on both sides to fight.

While I liked the dialogue-free quality of the opening scenes, I found their content cloying and only put up with them because I expected that there would be a big contrast coming up.

Having said all that, I liked Wicked Spring very much. I would compare it to much higher-profile Civil War movies such as Cold Mountain and Glory in quality.",1143504000,9,1565,4.961832061068702

Six soldiers, a terrible battle, friends, enemies, and waiting love are all in this story.  The acting is great too.

Just as the soldiers from both sides of the conflict laid aside their weapons and shared a campfire, the Director laid aside the politics of the War and brought into the light the predicament men in war find themselves in: they want love, but are asked to kill. That's harder to swallow than tack.

The battle scenes were nicely wrought, and these are where Hershberger's vision came out the most: because of the evocative mood, tone, and depth of the camera shots, the battle scenes were some of the best I've seen in Civil War movies. Hershberger should also be given kudos for casting natural actors with the look and integrity to carry this picture. Hershberger obviously saw that the two lead actors had presence, and, when the scene boils down to just the two of them talking about life, love, and war, Wicked Spring is at its best.

Nevertheless, I'd recommend this movie. Especially to Civil War buffs, but really to anybody interested in what goes on in a soldier's heart.",1103500800,40,1260,4.828703703703703
1936984,4,B0000E6FNK,"To be honest, the first time I watched this movie I was dissapointed. However, all movies deserve a second chance and this one was worth the second look.  If you put yourself into the position these soldiers found themselves then the movie becomes more real. Lost in the Wilderness at night, separated from your regiment, anyone close by suddenly becomes a lifeline, a friend. These soldiers reach out and camp together only to find out the truth about one another in the morning. The two main characters paint a pretty accurate picture of what the times back then were really like. After all the killing and bloodshed, the reality of war sets in and one sees it for what it really is. These soldiers get caught up in an airpocket separated from the war. Caught in the middle they have time to talk and become friends and see more than just North and South. The ending however is unfortunate, but the war itself was like that. It was reality. The movie actually brings you a little closer to the Civil War soldier, puts you in his shoes and lets you get a closer look at his thoughts and really see who he was. It was definately worth the second look.",1102291200,9,1151,4.480952380952381
1936985,5,B0000E6FNK,"I thought this film was excellent! It showed the complexity of war (in particular the Civil War). With a well-written screenplay, sound acting, beautiful cinematography and effective editing the filmmakers worked together to take you back in time. It helps to get into the characters to fully appreciate the dialogue that makes the movie more realistic. I love the down-to-earth approach taken in producing 'Wicked Spring'.

I especially thought the opener was effective in that there is no dialogue so pay close attention to the two male leads in those scenes. A lot more is happening than first may appear.  The scene where the father is saying good-bye to his three daughters is very moving. What a thing it is to leave your home and family to go to war. The sacrifice for all involved is obviously tremendous.

I have seen a lot of civil war movies and I thought this was one of the more realistic ones. The lighting or rather lack of lighting in the night scenes is very effective. And I absolutely loved the natural pauses and simple inferences made during the dialogue between soldiers. There is a rather pivotal scene where two soldiers connect rather than disconnect through reading letters from home. The is the scene that made this movie a notch above the rest. The acting was refreshingly not overacted. Other reviews give more detail. Bottom line, check this one out.

Perhaps those who did not like this film just didn't get it!",1098662400,13,1442,4.80241935483871
1936986,2,B0000E6FNK,"I really tried to like this film.  I generally like independent films and I LOVE Civil War flicks.  At the outset, I was skeptical  that the main premise, i.e., that soldiers could spend a night together and not realize that they were on opposite sides, might not work. I was not disappointed.  Aside from the general absurdity of the concept, more hints were dropped than cannonballs.  These characters would have had to have been just plain stupid not to know (the premise could have just as easily been that they knew they were enemies, but survived the night together anyway).  Additionally, the opening sequences of ""leaving home"" were cliche and sappy.  The battle scenes were fairly authentic, but the storyline just doesn't work, and the acting was just OK. The guy that finally realizes the situation spends the rest of the movie trying to beat everyone else up, and no matter how many times he gets knocked out, he revives and keeps coming (kind of a Civil War ""Halloween""). The ending is rather somber and pointless.  There is ten minute stretch by the campfire where some decent remembrences are exchaged, but thats about the only positive in the script.  It just really wasn't very good.",1094947200,13,1200,4.814634146341463
1936987,5,B0000E6FNK,"Director Kevin Hershberger has crafted an exciting and emotional Civil War drama set during the brutal 1864 battle of the Wilderness, where over 25,000 Confederate and Union troops were killed, wounded or captured. The battle scenes are brutal and real, and the acting is quite good. During the first ten minutes of the film, you see what each man is leaving behind as they go to war; one to fight to preserve the Union, the other to defend his home. Any Civil War historian, and fan of serious drama, will want to check out ""Wicked Spring."" Movie/DVD Grade: A-",1092960000,14,561,4.6767676767676765
1936988,3,B0000E6FNK,"I liked the opening scenes, even though they were a bit cliche. At the very least you saw what each character was leaving. The battle scenes were quite real and well done in my opinion. I hated the ending. Someone else noted the lack of a Hollywood ending, but I would have preferred it. (SPOILER WARNING) I got very emotionally invested in the two main guys and was devastated when I saw they both died. I realize they're going for realism, but they need to remember its a movie that's meant to entertain. I was very into the sequence of the letter reading/writing. For it all to come crashing down in the end and that's the way the movie ends? Very poor...didn't like it at all.",1092787200,8,680,4.404761904761905
1936989,5,B0000E6FNK,"The story line has been used in novels and films over and over again. The films saving grace is it's attention to Civil War soldier detail, and accuracy. If you could look in the past and see an actual Civil War battle, it may look alot like the scenes in this film. Some shots reminded me of war paintings from the period because everything was so damn correct. I have been a student of the Civil War since the 1960's and feel that this movie comes very close to the mark. I think the average movie watcher will find the film slow moving and ""fluffy."" Five stars for doing what no Hollywood picture has ever done: Portray a gritty realistic view of the American soldier from the 1860's. Also, It was great not having to see the overweight, middle aged re-enactors seen in Ted Turners celluloid pipe dreams. The average age of the real Civil war soldiers ranged from 18-26 years of age, according to Bruce Catton. These actors fit the bill.",1091232000,10,940,4.47093023255814
1936990,4,B0000E6FNK,"I thought this was an excellent war movie, lots and lots better than `Gods and Generals' with a more personal, human experience of the Civil War. Another excellent Civil War movie is `Ride with the Devil' and of course, 'Glory.' I found this film very powerful and thought it was well made, but I found it sometimes difficult to sit through - it's not a bad movie, just different in tone. I know it's not supposed to be a light film, but some of the scenes were traumatic to watch. I'm glad I saw it however. The war is shown in such a matter of fact way - people just get shot with no ceremony etc. exactly as it would have been. I liked the performances by Brian Merrick and Terry Jernigam. The rest of the cast was also great. I say get the video, it is a must see.",1082419200,7,768,4.126666666666667

Yes the film was short and the dialouge lacked in some places. But then again would you spill your whole life story to a stranger you'd just met? No. The film was on a $500,000 budget and they had like 65 re-enactors. With what little they had...they done an AWESOME job with the most accurate battle scenes and uniforms that have came outta the Civil War era of films. EVER!! This was a film about the horrors of war...and how we got to get a peek into just a few of the soldier's lives...and then we saw how everything was destoryed right before our eyes. As war really was and is.",1072224000,18,802,4.5
1936992,4,B0000E6FNK,"I would recommend this to all Civil war buffs and Indie filmmakers that have a chance to get a copy of this film. This is the first feature from this director and he does a great job. The story of two soldiers torn by war is as old as time, but ""Wicked Spring"" takes a fresh view at the troubles and trials of the Civil War soldier.
The best scenes in this movie are between the Union and Confederate leads over the reading and writing of letters home. A touching and believeable scene. Outstanding music worthy of any big budget flick, an intense and deliberate use of great sound effects.  The authentic feel of the movie is off the charts.

8001958,4,B0000E6FNK,This is a low budget but well written and acted independent film that features a plausible scenario during the US Civil War. The net result is a greek tragedy reflecting on the futility of war. The film focuses on some southern young men cheered on as they depart for wherever the front is. There's an indication this takes place before and during the Wilderness battle in Virginia which was particularly nasty. In the fog of battle these main characters get separated from their main regiment. The rest would be a spoiler. As a little 'ditty' in this genre I gave it high marks for the above and the filming style as well.,1458172800,,623,4.571428571428571
8001959,4,B0000E6FNK,"Ok, it is not Gettyburg or Glory but is a very good film!
I enjoyed it a lot.  The uniforms for both sides were very good!  The combat in the first third of the movie was hard hitting and much more intense than the big name CW movies.  There were some small things that only a history nerd or CW reenactor would have picked up on such as the yankee grinding his coffee beans with a rock in the bag before brewing it!
The tobacco chewing Confederate was annoying, he acts surprised that he shared a campfire with three yankee soldiers when the sun comes up.  Give me a break!  Plus his jumping on everyone with his WWW wrestling moves was ridiculous.  This prevents me from giving this film five stars.  Other than that I enjoyed the rest.  The friendship that developed between the yankee sergeant and the Confederate that could not read was poignant.  Reading his letters from his sweetheart and then writing a letter for him was touching and believable I think.
Bottom line; I recommend you add this to your CW video library!",1449014400,,1027,4.478494623655914
