8001929,5,B0000E68W6,"It's a good video very informative. It was very hard for me to decide which car is best for me. After watching the video, there's no doubt in my mind that i've made the right choice. If you want a car with awd, 300 hp and all the bells and whistle and you don't care about how heavy the car and somewhat descent handling then the Subaru sti is the one for you, but if you want a car with awd, a little less than 300 hp and just the basic bells and whistle and you care about the weight of the car and you want the best handling i mean a little or no under steer. Then you're like me, because i choose the 2005 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VIII.",1155168000,,643,3.953846153846154
8001930,5,B0000E68W6,The beginning of the DVD shows the history of the rivalry between the Lancer Evo and the Suby Impreza that stretches way back in the early 90's.  Great little showdown in Tsukuba.  Then later shows a great segment over the recently retired Skyline GTR and Supra.  I recomend this DVD to any Best Motoring fan trying to build up their AWD related DVD collection.,1141689600,,361,4.609375
8001931,5,B0000E68W6,"These BMI videos are a must for Sports Car and Racing enthusiasts. Not only you are able to see the latest machines on the scene, but also you can see them pushed hard by Japan's best drivers like Keichi Tshuschiya, Manabu Orido, Nobuteru Tanaguchi and Gan-San Kurosawa...

In this version of BMI video you will be able to see the latest 4WD Machines compared.

Then there is the Hot Version where you will be able to see an inline-six (choku-roku) shootout with some older GT-R's and a Supra. The pinacle of this show is the Mine's GT-R.

After that there is a small battle between Orido, Tshuchiya, Tanaguchi and Kawasaki using tuned RWD cars. You will see R-34 GT-R, FD-RX-7, S15 Silvia and Orido's personal Supra...",1138579200,,719,4.690476190476191
8001932,5,B0000E68W6,"Took me by surprise as to how wonderful this video is.  Instead of the low-grade home videos of the Import Lifestyle or the psychotic car videos that resembles MTV's ""Jackass"", this video is actually informative.  This video is straight from Japan and uses English subtitles, but the video is also professionally made, with no excessive wobbling.  The beginning of the video compares the history and merits of the Subaru WRX and the Mitsubishi Lancer/Evo.  What I found refreshing was that they actually interviewed an engineer from Subaru to describe the mechanical aspects of their car. They take every chronological variation of each vehicle and race it on a track to describe how well they perform.  As they're driving the cars, the video simultaneously shows the driver's steering, shifting, as well as their pedal work on a small square on the bottom left of the screen.  They also tuned each car in various configurations to judge how well they performed.  Though the DVD title seems to only imply they would only talk about the WRX vs. the Lancer, the next segment of the video describes the discontinued models of the Inline-6 vehicles.  The emphasis was mainly with the variations of the Supra and the Skyline.  There is a competition of cars tuned by amateurs and speed shops and judged by professional drivers.  As they're describing each car, they're also showing text specifications of each car.  This is where you'll probably need to hit the pause button if you want to read it because it goes by quick.  Found it interesting that a bikini girl would hold up a flash card to show the car specification, somehow I wouldn't have expected that, but I am not complaining.  Again, they showed the shifting, steering, and pedal work of each driver on the various Inline-6 cars and graded each car on its track performance.  My only complaint about this video is that I felt it was too short and they packed a lot of information in a short period of time.  But if you want to actually learn something as well as be entertained, this is the video.  This is a must video if you're about to buy an Evo or WRX.",1104624000,2,2114,4.703804347826087
8001933,5,B0000E68W6,"It's the question behind most popular debates...Which is faster, the Evo or the Scuby? This edition of BMI gives you indepth unbiased commentary and all out battles between these perfect rivals. In the end you may or may not get the answer you were looking for (too close to call). As if the Evo/Scuby battles weren't enough, BMI gives you a Tribute to in-line six engines that will blow you way!! Drift King's test drive of the Mine's R34 is wicked!! To top it off, BMI has a fierce farewell battle with the S15, RX-7, Supra and Skyline R34 that proves to be a good conclusion to this edition. Excellent addition to a car fans collection and for fans of the Evo and Scuby this is a MUST HAVE.",1091145600,,693,4.37984496124031
