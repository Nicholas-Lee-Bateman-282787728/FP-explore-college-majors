7873905,1,6304517297,"The original Boogeyman is a great classic and very well done. Boogeyman 2 had half of the films runtime in flashbacks to the original. The new material was good, but it could have been better than what it was. It was Mediocre at best. This 3rd film provides nothing new to the series, has even more of the same flashback sequences than ever before, and the new material is boring, low budget looking, terrible sound, and terrible acting. Why this was even made, I will never know. If there was a 4th movie to this, I would never buy it without reading reviews first, and probably still rent it before considering a purchase. I do own this film, but was forced to keep it because its on the same dvd pack as the original.",1444089600,,720,4.380597014925373
7873906,2,6304517297,"Return of the Boogeyman is a sequel to Boogeyman 2, but all it really does is throw a crazy-psychic redhead and her weird therapist on top of flashback after flashback from the original Boogeyman film.  Annie (Kelly Galindo) is tormented by nightmares about ""the man with no face"" and his murderous activities, and her hapless psychiatrist pushes her to go farther and farther into these visions.  They soon realize that Annie is seeing visions of murders about to be committed, but their efforts to save lives don't pan out very well.  Annie has a particularly strong connection to a young woman named Natalie, who - as a child - watched her brother kill their mother's abusive lover (""the man with no face"").  The two women share the same fears and horrors, and Annie works to use their special connection in order to warn Natalie of the danger she is in.  The man with no face basically lives inside the mirror that reflected his own bloody death to the eyes of young Natalie - although that premise gets stretched to the breaking point at times.

Wait a minute - why am I even bothering to explain all this?  It's hardly worth the effort, and folks who have seen the original Boogeyman know the guy's story, anyway.  Well over half of this film's 76 minutes consists of footage lifted from the original Boogeyman film.  The rest consists of Annie and her doctor (and the doc's assistant, although he apparently left the set early because his character inexplicably disappears near the end) acting all serious as they talk about Annie's problems.  Sometimes, you can't even understand what the doc and his assistant are saying, as the microphone is too far away to pick up their voices.  Basically, what you've got here is a low-budget dud that exploits the original Boogeyman for a quick buck or two.  Boogeyman fans will feel robbed, while those who have not seen the original will be mildly entertained at best.",1132790400,,1917,4.740963855421687
