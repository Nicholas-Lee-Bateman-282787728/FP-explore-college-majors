It's a fun movie, but the plot, a rehash of every inspirational teacher movie out there, is not suitable for the dirty dancing movie it strives to be. It should have stuck to one or the other. The Forbidden Dance, another movie about the Lambada dance craze, released the same day in theaters, fared slighlty better because of the more adult story. While this is purely enjoyable fluff, I never once believed that the actors were high school students, which ruined it for me. And the dancing is just not seductive enough. However, I was engrossed in the story and loved the cheesiness to it all. Recommended for an early 90's reminisce.",1089331200,7,737,4.72093023255814
1830187,5,B00008973B,"Grab It - A chance of Lifetime to Pick up Lambada Dance Pick - My choice 'Golden collection' & 5 Stars! I was gifted this DVD by my sis long ago and since then, it stands best setting fire in my room as I click on to watch it sometimes on special occassions. My hubby is too awe struck to see the swings and we even tried out the steps but ugh oh, its not cup of tea for all to dance 'Lambada'. The movie is simply superb but as far as my collection goes, I gotta Lambada Dance track exclusive too. Another nice movie was Dance with me which had some great dancing on floor apart from other movies like footloose, Dirty Dancing & Saturday Night Fever. Pick up if you really like Dancing, any day-any time, the unique Lambada tip toeing.",1068076800,5,736,4.153846153846154
1830188,4,B00008973B,"I was surprised to hear that 'Lambada' was getting released on DVD out of all the many movies that are out there, but I'm soooooooooooooooo glad because this is one of those films I just LOVE. I already have it on video and have watched it many times. This movie isn't just some silly, ... try-hard dancing movie, It's really entertaining, funny, I love the actors, the music just makes me want to jump out of my seat and Set the Night On Fire. J.Eddie Peck, Melora Hardin, Ricky Paull Goldin etc are all fantastic and entertaining. The film has a good message about the importance of education what Blade is trying to teach the kids. The DVD quality is good, it's presented in full frame but I'm not complaining, I'll take 'Lambada' any way I can get it- I'm just happy it's on DVD. YAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

1830189,5,B00008973B,"After watching this movie on t.v.,I just loved the internal message it was sending out. Stay in school, education is the key to a young person's life. It's not one of those typical movies with senseless violence, sex, etc. I truly believe the crux of this movie's concept is how important education is. You don't have to be a genius to learn. There are several scenes that are really captivating where it hits a home run about that above mentioned principle.
I definitely would recommend this movie to not just adults but to high school teenagers as well.",1367712000,,555,4.673469387755102

1830193,5,B00008973B,A fun dance movie with a different story line.  A math teacher takes a real interest in teaching students that have difficulty with school as opposed to boy meets girl.  Dance is part of him that helps connect him with the kids.  He is a great example for the kids and has wonderful ethics.  A feel good movie with great dancing.,1247702400,,329,4.344262295081967
1830194,2,B00008973B,I bought this movie to add to my Dance movie collection. Movie really has nothing to do with the Lambada dance. Very disappointing.,1235606400,,131,4.739130434782608

1830196,1,B00008973B,"I was never a professional dancer, but always loved to dance. I guess that's at least one reason why I love to watch dancers perform almost any type of dance. That's certainly why I tend to buy so many moves sight unseen if they even suggest that I'll see lots of dancing.

What can I say? I was expecting a lot from Lambada, but the movie let me down in a big way. In my humble opinion, the movie is more about smut that strut with not nearly enough dancing. The movie was extremely boring with a very weak plot. I can usually take that if the dancing is strong and the music is grand. This movie lacked both. Truly disappointing.",1128211200,7,631,4.214876033057851

1830198,4,B00008973B,"Hi! If you're into all sorts of dance and music videos, then you'll definately want to buy or rent this movie. I love the Lambada dance and the ethnic background it has so I LOVE the movie. The other Lambada movie is my favorite though. It has to do with a Brazilian girl making money dancing the Lambada in a club. GO WATCH the movie. it's a definate watch!!!! You won't regret.",1094601600,6,379,4.277777777777778
