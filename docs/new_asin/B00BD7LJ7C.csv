While it isn't the best done anime out there, I think anybody who can appreciate the bubbly animation and good world and character design would like this! The races and scenery are very diverse and unique and just pretty in general haha. The show is a little cheesy overall but it's bearable and honestly not tHAt bad lmao. Idk maybe I have a bias because I grew up on these and played both the Wakfu and Dofus games for a long while (not to mention I loved everything Ankama), but I really do recommend at least watching a few episodes!! It's a pretty show and the style is really likeable!!",1471651200,,698,4.4186046511627906
8566630,3,B00BD7LJ7C,"Ok first off I would like to say I really really tried to like this anime. But it just wasn't happening, the plot is weak and I'm sure if I had played the game it would have made more sense. But as it stands your given no background and basically it's almost like cutscenes that where strung together. Characters are given little development and it's just poorly executed from start to finish. To really get a feel however for just how underdeveloped it is is to see the wiki where sections upon sections of main character and supporting character  info is left out or to put it simply is just not there. Fight scenes are lack lustere the jokes are the same rehashed ones from the first few episodes. Even the subplots  are stale and lacking. And just in general the fact that probably Yugo himself doesn't understand what made him go see these mysterious parents of his. All and all not for the serious anime fan but if you just want something to casually watch as your doing something else than its right up your alley.",1444953600,,1021,4.454545454545454
