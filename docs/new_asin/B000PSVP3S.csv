4484349,5,B000PSVP3S,"I recorded this movie from analog TV several years ago and have watched it many times.  I am delighted that it finally is available on commercial DVD in high quality and without all the commercials on my recording!  I think the story is delightfully funny, romantic and also points out how staged ""reality"" TV really is.  One thing that threw me off the track a little is that they changed its name from ""I Want To Marry Ryan Banks"" to ""The Reality of Love.""  But by any name this is a nice movie that I would recommend highly.",1351036800,2,527,4.346938775510204
4484350,4,B000PSVP3S,"I totally felt like I'd seen this movie before, and as soon as I saw the first review it confirmed why it reminds felt like deja  vu. parts of it are like the show The Bachelor. It's a good movie, a little predictable but it's still a fun date night movie to watch with your significant other- oh,  he said this movie is boring lol  okay Well I say it's a cute movie :)",1346457600,2,369,3.9594594594594597
4484351,5,B000PSVP3S,It's a good movie if you want to just relax and escape the world. It was on TV before and no offense to Amazon but I have already seen it on sale at stores.,1343347200,,156,3.6176470588235294
4484352,5,B000PSVP3S,"This is a great movie, I never watched The Bachelor but this has a whole new twist to it.  I love the way the movie ends, it's a must see movie...",1337126400,4,146,3.7096774193548385
4484353,5,B000PSVP3S,"This was previously aired on ABC Family under the title ""I Want to Marry Ryan Banks.""  But don't be deterred by the fact that this was a made-for-TV movie.  It's a fantastic romantic comedy, one of my absolute favorites.  Granted, it's a bit hard to buy Jason Priestly as a highly sought after bachelor, but it really doesn't matter because half the point is laughing at how absurd it is thinking he'll magically find love in a staged reality program.  Bradley Cooper and Emma Caulfield are absolutely adorable- the chemistry between them is amazing.  You'll melt from the cuteness if you're a romance fan.  I honestly can't believe they didn't release this on DVD sooner, as the fans have been screaming for it.  I literally squealed with delight when I saw that they are finally releasing it.",1336780800,19,794,4.751824817518248
4484354,5,B000PSVP3S,"This story starts off with two very best friends Ryan Banks & Todd Dorey. Ryan becomes a well known movie star but has been off the scene for awhile. So they deside to do a realitey Tv Show titled I Want To Marry Ryan Banks. This is to get him back on the scene. When they are picking the contestents for the show they picked a lady Charlie Morton.

Throughout the film we see they want Charlie to win it. But when you look a it she doesen't fall in love with Ryan she falls in love with his best friend Todd. Todd gets fired from his job and one of the producers sneak him into the set. But Todd didn't know that he was on camera in the room. Todd was the one who was unlucky in love but when Ryan was doing things around Charlie it was Todd telling him to say these things. So Charlie found out it was Todd all along. So Charlie knew Todd was the one for her and not Ryan. It's coming close to the end not going to spoil it as you should see this movie for yourselves.",1335744000,2,970,3.9489795918367347
4484355,5,B000PSVP3S,This movie is pure gold. Soooo good. Keeping my fingers crossed it will become available in the States.,1280102400,8,103,4.777777777777778
4484356,5,B000PSVP3S,"Most of the time, made for TV movies seem to be just that, made for TV and TV only. But this one is different. It isn't just like all the other TV movies out there. This movie can be compared to the made for TV movie ""Lucky Seven"" in quality.

""I Want to Marry Ryan Banks"" tells the story of a down and out actor who's last hope is to, with the help of his best friend and agent, make it to the big times once again. His friend sets up a reality TV show similar to ""The Bachelor"" in order to boost his career.

While it seems that Ryan is a big hit with all the ladies on the show, it is only because his friend and agent, Todd, is feeding him lines through an earpiece. One by one the number of girls dwindle and the favorite, Charlie, has fallen in love with Todd in a romance that started the minute he interviewed her for the show.

This is a really great romantic comedy and Bradley Cooper steals the show, as Todd. Or at least I think so. I haven't actually seen this movie in a few years since it hasn't been on television, but if it ever actually is released on DVD, I will definitely buy it.

I recommend this to anyone who enjoys romantic comedies or who likes Bradley Cooper's movies(Wedding Crashers, Failure to Launch.) It is highly enjoyable and maybe a little cheasy, but totally worth it in the end.",1212796800,39,1315,4.165354330708661

4484358,5,B000PSVP3S,"I LOVED this movie! It was a pleasant surprise. I watched it on a streaming network and liked it so much that I just ordered the DVD. I even streamed it twice in a row, just so I could fast-forward to all of the cute parts again. The lead characters had great chemistry, and it had a really cute ending with a twist :) movies like this are usually so predicatable. I like that this one wasn't exactly what I thought it would be. It was *almost* family-friendly, depending on your standards. At one point Bradley Cooper is awkwardly semi-forced to ask the main gal about her sex life, which she storms out about. Then 2 of the female contestants are sexual - one acts seductive by her facial expressions, and the other has big boobs that the main bachelor makes a big deal about. It's probably all still on a PG level.",1472688000,,817,4.34640522875817

4484362,1,B000PSVP3S,I have no idea why this movie has so many positive reviews on here  because it's terrible. I like Bradley Cooper but this has got to be one of his worst movies. The script is crap even worse than a lifetime movie although I think this was made for tv so maybe it is one lol and I didn't feel any chemistry at all between Bradley and that woman who co stared with him..

4484364,4,B000PSVP3S,"I don't know what it is about this little gem of a movie, but I just adore it. It's of course extremely cheesy, but every time it came on television I would eagerly sit down to watch it (it originally aired under the title ""I want to Marry Ryan Banks""). Finally, since none of the streaming sites seem to be picking it up, I decided I needed to own it, and I'm very glad I bought the DVD.

4484371,4,B000PSVP3S,"This is a fun movie to watch.  It is predictable, though; and, without Bradley Cooper it would have been a dud.  He is, as always, an amazing actor.  He takes a simple plot and makes it interesting to watch through his performance.  We believe that Todd (Bradley) really loves one of the contestants, who is not in the contest for his affections, but that of the actor Ryan Banks (Priestly), of whose career Todd is managing.  This contest is a big career boost if Banks, as the actor every girl swoons over,  can pull it off.  He even agrees to marry the winning contestant, but things go awry.
I liked this movie.  Entertaining and tastefully done.",1442966400,,650,4.543103448275862

4484386,5,B000PSVP3S,"I have adored this movie since it first premiered on ABC Family eleven years ago under the title ""I Want To Marry Ryan Banks."" As someone who loves the reality series the Bachelor for it's entertainment value and for mocking purposes, this parody is completely perfect. The cast is great. Jason Priestly (Beverly Hills, 90210) stars as Ryan Banks, a vapid movie star who is quickly losing his star power due to his womanizing ways. Emma Caulfeld (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) plays Charlie, a down to earth girl who gets roped into a reality show by her sister. Bradley Cooper (in the days before he was famous), rounds out the cast as Ryan's agent, best friend, and all around good guy. It's not only a sweet romantic comedy, but for anyone who appreciates a tongue-in-cheek spoof on reality TV, it's also a barrel of laughs.

I will also say that I was quite surprised that I loved it so much. I never expected a made-for-TV movie to become one of my all time favorites, but this film will always have a special place in my heart.",1422748800,2,1029,4.532258064516129

However, when I viewed the original movie after I ordered it online I was surprised (yet in reality should not have been) that there were a couple of scenes that had been deleted from Hallmark's airing. I understand why Hallmark deleted them since they adhere to family-oriented standards (which is why I appreciate them). But in retrospect, the fact that it was originally made for ABC's Family channel, I am not at all surprised by those scenes. ABC Family channel's definition of family-friendly is clearly different from mine. Some may disagree with me but that's okay. I just did not expect to see the couple of scenes that were deleted from Hallmark's airing of the movie. While I wasn't offended I was disappointed because I thought I was buying exactly what was aired. That said, it didn't have any R rated scenes but some dialogue and insinuations were inappropriate for what I would consider a ""family-friendly"" movie. Thus the reason for my 4 stars.

4484423,4,B000PSVP3S,"I ordered this movie because it got such good reviews. Aside from the typical shortcomings that you find with a television movie, I really liked this film.  With the glut of reality shows nowadays, the setting and theme for the movie is much less than original. It centers around a movie star whose career is in a rut and who agrees to do a reality show to find a wife in order to bolster his image. The movie does a pretty good job of recreating the tackiness of a reality show. The romantic aspect comes from the fact that the leading contestant falls in love with the movie star's manager along the way. The movie has a bit of a surprise twist at the end that really fits the reality show aspect of the whole thing. The two characters that fall in love have some decent chemistry in the film which makes it easy to watch. The only complaint that I have about the movie is the setting. It is supposed to have taken place in L.A., but was obviously filmed mostly in Canada. The producers tried to cover up the wrong setting with lots of close-in shots, interior shots and backgrounds with washed out lighting. In spite of that, there isn't one scene in the movie that looks even remotely like the place it is supposed to be set. Most of the characters wear winter jackets when outside which doesn't help either. I would have preferred that the movie just be set in Canada. I think it would have been more convincing and added to the charm of the film. In any case, that's a fairly small complaint about a film that's pretty good.",1364601600,4,1530,4.368421052631579
4484424,4,B000PSVP3S,"I am watching this movie, thinking to myself, I've seen this movie before.  I'm driving myself crazy trying to figure out where I have seen a similar movie.  It finally came to me! The movie was Win a Date with Tad Hamilton and if I remember correctly one of the 15 contestants is the same  in both movies.  Because of the similarity of the two movies I was disappointed by  Reality of Love  I was looking for something new, fresh and unique.",1362355200,,442,4.329268292682927
