We are into 1980 now and Sharon Gilmore (Margot Knight) is soon joined by her lover Judy Bryant (Betty Bobbitt) within the walls of Wentworth. Jim Fletcher's (Gerard Maguire) homelife is disrupted thanks to the help of Michael Simpson (Peter Ford) and Geoff Butler (Ray Meagher), resulting in wife Leila (Penny Ramsey) asking Jim to leave home.
Inside Wentworth a stray dog is taken in by Lizzie Birdsworth (Sheila Florance) only to be told by Vera Bennett (Fiona Spence) that the dog will be put down. Little does Lizzie know that Vera has other plans for Chips the dog.
New inmates during this period also include artist Kerry Vincent (Penny Downie) who has a part in causing Vera's suspension. We are also introduced to Helen Smart (Caroline Gillmer) and Gail Summers (Susanne Howarth). A face from the past appears in Wentworth too - Leanne Bourke (Tracey - Jo Riley) who is taken under Judy's wing.
