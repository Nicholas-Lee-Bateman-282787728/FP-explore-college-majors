8706896,5,B00UHKIPMS,"Not the typical Bollywood movie. A mute, his love for film, his dream that becomes a reality with help from unexpected people. This is only the second movie I have got the pleasure of seeing Dhanush in. Even without using his voice at all (for his role), he is still a great actor. Amitabh was the
perfect choice for Dhanush's other half.",1442880000,,338,4.467741935483871
8706897,5,B00UHKIPMS,"Oh my, oh my, they really let Amitabh chew up the scenery here.  How great for him that he gets these wonderful roles these days.  This is quite a story, showing off how Bollywood has matured in recent years and now produces real cinema competitive to Hollywood.  I won't take off a star, but the premise is ridiculous, and I love the disclaimer that all technology in the film is fictitious.",1441497600,,392,4.492957746478873
