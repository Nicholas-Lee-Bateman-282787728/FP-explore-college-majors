8254505,5,B0014567SY,"The DVD was good, Jiro could piss you off for his short-sightedness and selfishness these episode. His lil brother is great though and makes good friends with Zelman [oddly enough] whether or not it was plot of a bigger plan we'll never know as the series wasn't finished. [Sad enough] The last episode leaves you with the emptiness that there should be more, but unless the creators work for another company this is the end of the Silver Blades story. The only con is that because it isn't finish it left parts of the plot open for more episodes.",1300838400,,547,4.5353535353535355
8254506,4,B0014567SY,"It's not perfect but Black Blood Brothers at least manages to cross the finish line. The conclusion to this series however left me mostly unsatisfied. While questions were answers, battles were left unfinished and the climax happened way too fast. While this is never going to go down as a classic, it might entertain vampire fans for a little while. Ultimately you won't be missing anything if you skip this series.",1224806400,,416,4.873239436619718
