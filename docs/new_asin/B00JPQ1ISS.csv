6388542,4,B00JPQ1ISS,"We saw Born Free when it was released 50 years ago.  It was great to see it again.  Elsa, the lion, steals the show.  Bittersweet ending.  Recommend watching.  Acting is a little dated but Elsa definitely makes movie worth seeing.

We can not rate the Living Free sequel to Born Free.  That portion of the DVD was badly scratched so could only watch a little of the movie.  What we saw was about Elsa's three cubs and efforts to save them after Elsa dies.  Portion we saw was good.  Scratches were very frustrating.",1472601600,,515,4.440860215053763

6388552,3,B00JPQ1ISS,"I bought this for my grandkids, feeling they would enjoy Born Free as much as I had when I was young. I was right about that. My four-year-old granddaughter sleeps with the dvd, she loved it so much. BUT the second movie, which I had never seen--Living Free--was a disaster. Elsa dies, her cubs have to fend for themselves, and poachers kill everything in sight, turning animals into coats and horrible collectibles. The kids were scandalized. If I'd known, I'd have kept the dvd at my house and not let them see the second film.",1458864000,7,529,4.578947368421052

I would recommend parents show this to their children as an illustration of the moral importance of doing the right thing and the wonderful outcomes that can result.
