8149293,5,B000J5F37G,This was such a blast from the past. I used to love this show on saturday morning when I was a kid. It was still fun to watch. The graphics were pretty sad and poorly done. But that's what there was at the time. Benita the evil character had constant wardrobe changes at every turn. I wish their had been more than three episodes though. I still love it. It's silly and goofy but fun!,1356566400,4,384,4.133333333333334
8149294,5,B000J5F37G,"I got this for my 3 year old daughter but honestly, I wanted to see if she would like as much as I did. She loves it! Some of the images are little freaky (that's the most appropriate term I can think of), but we talk about them and she's okay with it. My two year old son loves Sparky.",1296518400,5,286,3.783333333333333
