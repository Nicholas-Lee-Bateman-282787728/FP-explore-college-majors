8569001,4,B00BIDNOGU,"A cute little movie I think, never really gets boring, and the story keeps progressing, the acting was good too, even from the kids! the film is an adaptation from a manga, which I have not read, so I don't really know how accurate it is, also a thing I found funny/brave from the director was the feature of a German language song in the film, Die Konkurrenz by Wir Sind Helden, which I think worked out quite well, the chorus of the song repeats Die konkurrenz shclfts nicht, which means something like, the competition never sleeps, properly referring to Daikichis struggle to keep up with everything in the start of the film.
So I would recommend this film, 4 out of 5 stars from me :)",1425168000,,689,4.433070866141732
