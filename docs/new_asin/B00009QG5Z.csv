7992694,5,B00009QG5Z,I love this movie-so many great films come out of Poland. This is good for us to see if we think the tragedy of the concentration camps ended with their liberation. Great condition and shiping time. I am very pleased.,1367625600,,217,4.45
7992695,1,B00009QG5Z,"I tried watching this film, and could only stand about 20-30 minutes before I took it out od the DVD player.  It made no sense! it wasn't inspiring or logical, I just couldn't understand what was going on...Cinematography, issues, or whatever other features people praised about this film which led me to buy it were disappointingly unfounded rave reviews.  I would not recommend this film for anyones private foreign movie collection, like I'm trying to start.  Just plain stupid and dull.",1354752000,,490,5.0246913580246915
7992696,1,B00009QG5Z,"The man the wrote 3 of the reviews and maybe the fourth must have been connected with the film for some reason. His description of the story if quite good and through but all three were biased and word for word identical. The narrative was very good, but the evaluation was obviously very slanted. However, three things need to be added. The film was 90+ in a foreign language with subtitles, it never explained why the Polish and American troop wanted to imprison and even kill the Polish men they liberated from the concentration camps and lastly the ""love"" story did not seem to develop as one would expect. But the film did flow slowly but maintained my interest and the acting of the two main characters was good.  I never did understand the marching and violin playing. I gave it one star because the other review were apparently very biased and rated this movie way to high.  SORRY but that's how I see it.",1268179200,3,913,4.527272727272727
7992697,4,B00009QG5Z,"The dominant theme of this film director is the IIWW, prior, during and after.  This film is a further contribution to this theme, but deals with Poland directly after the cessation of hostilities.  It shows influences of existing and evolving political powers and ideas on basically more or less broken and scarred survivors.
I do not speak Polish so must relay on subtitles for most of the dialogue.
I find that the film helps me understand this time period in Poland.
I do not know if it is just me, but I have a great deal of difficulty finding the film credible when it portrays starving survivors who hardly look starving.
Wajda is a great director, no doubt.
But today, if a great director wishes to portray a starving survivor he / she will make their actors starve and submit themselves to some of the hardship which the people they portray experienced.
That does not appear to be the case in this film.
Staving survivors looked anything but starving and were generally not credible for me.  They appeared to me to be well fed actors doing a days work.  This compromised the film for me.
This is my opinion.",1267833600,3,1116,4.592964824120603
