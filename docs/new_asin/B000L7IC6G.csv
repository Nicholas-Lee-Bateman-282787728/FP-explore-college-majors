2700628,4,B000L7IC6G,"Entertaining, sexy melodrama set in Franco's Spain, based on a true story.

A young solider is torn between his virginal, virtuous hard working fiance,
and his hot-blooded, small time criminal landlady, with whom he has a
tempestuous affair, leading to betrayals and ultimately murder.

Well acted, and never dull, but also never seems to go very deep into the characters, with
sudden changes in alliance and attitude occurring without much explanation, or too
fast to be believed.  Consequentially, it's never very emotional, even if the story is
tragic.  It all has a slightly over-the top, operatic feel.  A movie I enjoyed, but doubt
I'd have the inclination to see again,",1300492800,,676,5.109090909090909

8160291,5,B000L7IC6G,"It isn't clear why all but one of the reviews is from the 20 year old VHS version. The main criticism was that it was an edited version missing, I suppose, some of the more erotic scenes. Standards have changed a bit since then and what ever eroticism was originally intended was pretty tame and in my view inconsequential to the important dilemmas & conflicts in the storyline . The intrigue within the movie is who is the self serving central male figure going to choose: (a.) the sexually provocative and experienced older female or (b.) the devout innocent younger female. And, what price is he willing to pay for his decision. If you haven't read any hints to the movie then the ending is probably going to be a surprise.

A bit dated (clothing styles for each period leave such an indelible image) but the acting, directing, script and cinematography, as the Goya award attests to, carry well into the present.",1319328000,4,916,4.654320987654321
8160292,1,B000L7IC6G,"BUYERS BEWARE as a previous review stated. This IS NOT the original version of this movie. Large sections have been removed. And when viewing, you can be confounded as to ""what just happened?"" or left wondering WHY(?). Anyway, the many things that made the original amazing have been deleted from this versison. BEST TO JUST AVOID.",1319328000,23,331,4.928571428571429
