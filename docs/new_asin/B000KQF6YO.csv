8158711,1,B000KQF6YO,"I used this video through a library before purchase. I loved it. However, the DVD's I received from seller smelled so bad that I had to air them outside for 2 wks. Only DVD's did not have odor after that time. However, they were badly pitted I assume from whatever caused the odor. The shipping box was also very bad. Additional product in the box was fine. Not useable and was a pain for 2 wks.",1458864000,,395,4.2105263157894735
8158712,4,B000KQF6YO,This is a great video. I had always wanted a less impact workout and this is just what I was looking for,1362787200,,104,3.772727272727273
8158713,4,B000KQF6YO,"This is a great yoga DVD.

It is so relaxing! The instructor keeps her talking to a minimum and the background music is soothing.

The routines focus mostly on stretching, as the title suggests. She does lots of repetitions of the sun salutations, giving you time to get into the rhythm of the movement.

The poses are all pretty basic. Someone with lots of yoga experience probably wouldn't get much out of this DVD but its great for people who want to improve their flexibility and de-stress.

Since it's only 20 minutes, I find it's a great way to stretch after a long run or extreme workout.  It's also great first thing in the morning or before bed.",1323302400,2,654,4.508474576271187
8158714,5,B000KQF6YO,"This is a 2 pack- 2 DVD's of Shelly McDonald. She has a calm voice and demeanor. The Stretch Into Yoga DVD is slower paced than the Yoga for the Core, so try the Stretch disc first, if you are new to yoga. Each routine does give the range of easy to advanced, which is a good feature for all levels of expertise. I had never tried yoga at home or in a class, so this was an eye-opener for me, in terms of having to learn moves that I was not familiar with, but if I can do it, anyone can! I took it slow, tried each move with care and was able to do all 3 routines on each DVD, right straight through, in a very short time (over the course of 2 weeks, maybe). You can choose to do a 15-20 minute routine or do all 3 at one time, which gives a full hour of exercise. I do enjoy the way I feel afterward, even though yoga is not my ""thing""- I feel relaxed and stretched. I know I have done my body ""good"".",1283644800,4,903,3.8085106382978724
