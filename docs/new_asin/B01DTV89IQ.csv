8756887,2,B01DTV89IQ,"I thought I was prepared for this series, but it still managed to make me grit my teeth and wonder if I was watching the right series or somehow had wandered into a nearly the same name knock off series.

It tries to be serious, it tries to be dramatic, but most third grade drama classes do a better job of handling the lines.  I got the feeling no one connected with it really cared about anything past their paycheck.  I have been told that I am supposed to feel pressured by the the heavy pressure the plot and delivery presents.

If you are big into heavy pressure and no hope stories, this one is for you.

Not for me.",1524614400,,624,4.166666666666667
