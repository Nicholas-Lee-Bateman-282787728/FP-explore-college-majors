8489441,5,B005Z4OI1I,I'm a big fan of this jail program series. Recommend this for anyone at least 17 years of age or older however.,1500508800,,111,4.090909090909091
8489442,5,B005Z4OI1I,"I bought this to show my high school students before-during-after reading Hole in My Life by Jack Gantos. My students LOVE this show, and they asked me on a daily basis if we could watch it. I did have to get parent permission slips - the show does have cursing (that is bleeped out), and obviously it isn't a Disney movie.

This show is incredibly entertaining, and some of my students could see a little bit of themselves in the kids going on the jail tours.",1453766400,,460,4.348837209302325

8489444,3,B005Z4OI1I,"Quality is pretty poor and does not fit the screen of most modern TV. These are pretty outdated dvd. If you have a older tv that you only play simple dvds on than this will work fine.

Now as for the show, I personally love it myself.",1419811200,,234,3.978723404255319
8489445,5,B005Z4OI1I,"Beyond Scared Straight is one of my favorite shows. This show teaches our children like preteenagers and teenagers who are acting like an violent and spoiled brat. If those children are acting like brats, then the law would and will treat them like brats. WARNING, this show is not for little children because of bad language and real convicts. Those children were sent to a jail program as a reality check for their inappropriate decisions by their parents who did not gave them any communication, discipline, respect, and most important of all, parental love. The children's inappropriate decisions were drug abuse, domestic violence, armed robbery, arson, fighting, expelled from school, sex, run away from home, disrespect their parents, burglary, even gang banging. If they do not change their attitude or make one bad decision, they will go to jail for good. In this show, those children  will met the most worst, nasty, violent, and real convicts who were arrested for their crimes and real cops will make the children change their attitude by showing how the convicts live day in and day out in jail: how they sleep, where they stay in a cramped jail cell, what they eat, what they do outside, even what they do in the restroom and the showers. The cops and the convicts use imitation and pressure. Cops use pressure on those children like the cops get on the children's faces and they scream at them, they were forced to put their hands on the wall, so the cops can arrest the children, do exercise routines or they were forced to put on jumpsuits. The convicts are the worst ones than the cops because they are tough on them than the cops are and they use imitation on those children like they get on their faces, they scream at them, they swear at them, they steal their possessions, so they want the child to snitch on them, and they even use violence. They said that everyday will be a risk for convicts because one day in jail will be an convict's last day, but it is what those children needed. I gave this show a 5 star rating.",1417651200,3,2043,4.628099173553719
8489446,5,B005Z4OI1I,"I used the video series in my classroom (Boys 2 Men Enrichment Course) as a supplement to help at risk boys. My class would view the eposides  and had several deep conversations about the importance of making good decision in life. I would highly recommended ""Beyond Scared Straight"" to at risk teenagers and children.",1391126400,,318,4.888888888888889

8489450,5,B005Z4OI1I,"Right from the start, this show grips you in with the misbehavior of today's youth in America. A lot of the preteen/teens featured in the series stems from mostly a cry for attention, which a lot of their parents have not been providing to these children -- discipline and love. The teens are forced to go to a state prison as a wake up call to see how other inmates seem to live day in and out and understand the privileges they have now as a kid could be gone tomorrow with one bad decision. Most of the behavior is quite typical from teen to teen: drug abusers, drug dealers, violence, disrespecting their parents, expelled from school, promiscuous sex and runaways. The inmates are tough on them -- but it's what they need -- since something is lacking with the parents who aren't doing such in my opinion! Most of the teens correct their bad behavior by the end of each episode and understand they don't have to be badass to be viewed as cool or wanted by their other peers. Pretty good series I tune every chance I get on A&E.",1348704000,6,1032,4.380208333333333
