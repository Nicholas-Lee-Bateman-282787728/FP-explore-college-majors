He doesn't really teach you that much, he just voices over the DVD while he demonstrates his technique. He does not show you how to do anything. There is no stance work or how to move your body or anything, the camera is always at waist high, just like on the cover of the DVD and that's pretty much all you see. Must admit though his skill at blowing out a candle is impressive, I think about twice he failed but at least one hundred successes. Large writing of the subject of interest comes on the screen sits there for a while then he does a  voice over of the subject, but does not really explain much and what he does explain is just to hard to understand. Save your money.",1383091200,,829,4.149068322981367
8371324,5,B002J9H8ZA,MR. LAMB IS THE REAL THING.  I WAS TOTALLY AMAZED AFTER WATCHNG THIS VIDEO.  HE IS ON A TOTALLY DIFFERENT LEVEL OF TEACHER THAN I HAVE EVER SEEN.  THE DVD IS ABSOLUETLY MIND-BLOWING.  I AM REALLY TAKING HIS BOOKS SERIOUSLY AFTER SEEING WHAT HE IS CAPABLE OF DOING.,1258329600,3,264,4.4375
