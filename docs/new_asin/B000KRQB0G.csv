8158903,5,B000KRQB0G,"Movie Critics were not kind in their appraisal of Say Hello To Yesterday.
Either they claimed it was weak or a bad movie. I am not a critic, but find
it relevant in our real world. We learned Lessons from this Film because it
tackled the sensitive issues of  Death and May-December Affair, albeit a
very short one between a respectable housewife and joie de vivre lad.

The woman played by Jean Simons tried to heal the trauma of Leonard Whiting
and after she did her role, she exited from his life once and for all.
With no doubt in her mind that one day the young boy would find a true
love of her own, while she has to be satisfied with her dull husband and
children. The woman has no choice but to carry the same chores for the
rest of her life but with beautiful memories to lighten her fading days.",1308528000,9,804,4.214285714285714
8158904,4,B000KRQB0G,"This movie was not a good as remembered, but still worth the purchase.  Jean Simmons passed away this year and it
  is a nice memento of her later movie rolls.  In this film Ms. Simmons is a COUGAR before anyone coined the term and
  the styles of the day (speech, dress and acting) are fun to re-visit.",1299888000,6,303,4.228070175438597
8158905,4,B000KRQB0G,"This comment is written by Ron's wife. I had seen this movie when I was in my early 20's and still swooning over the gorgeous Leonard Whiting from 'Romeo and Juliet'.  At that time I found his character's playfulness in ""Say Hello to Yesterday"" charming and endearing but now, in my 50's,I found it incredibly annoying. Saddened that my memory didn't match my recent viewing. The 4 stars is for the seller not the movie itself. The seller, Amazon,as always, was easy to deal with and quick to ship the merchandise which was in excellent condition. They refunded my money upon my request at being so disappointed and the movie not being cheap, which is kind and generous, as most places will not give you a refund once the movie is opened but Amazon has always been the best to deal with concerning any problems we have had and I can't say enough good things about them.",1297555200,4,869,4.535031847133758
