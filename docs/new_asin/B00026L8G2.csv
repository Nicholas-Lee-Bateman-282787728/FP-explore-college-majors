8022757,5,B00026L8G2,"I love the tmnt, and I really love the second season. I couldn't afford to buy the collection, so I bought the season piece by piece. This was a great addition to my collection!",1359676800,,177,4.235294117647059
8022758,5,B00026L8G2,"So after the turtles defeat Shredder and escape from the TCRI building, they take a break at Casey's grandmother's farm in the episode Reflections.  Yeah its a clip show, but its featuring the Shredder!  Our heros reflect, hehheh, on everything they know concerning him thus far.  And they also ponder the reason why they became the Tmnt.

  And in the Ultimate Ninja, Leonardo has to face a mysterious oponent from another dimension.  But does Splinter know more about this foe and his agenda than he's admiting?

  The other two eps are alright.  Its a good set over all.",1146787200,2,573,4.744897959183674
8022759,2,B00026L8G2,"This disc contains 4 episodes of the new TMNT series: Reflections, Ultimate Ninja, The Return of Nano, and The Golden Puck (billed as a bonus episode). While fans who are collecting the entire series will want this disc, there are two things to consider:

1)Reflections is a clip show episode, meaning you've seen at least half the footage already. Sometimes clip shows are decent - the original TMNT series managed a decent clip show, and the Simpsons has done a few funny ones. However, while the premise for Reflections isn't bad, the series has always devoted the beginning of its episodes to extended recaps. These got especially tiring during during the period from ""Search For Splinter"" to ""Secret Origins."" To do a clip show on top of recaps is redundant and annoying.

2)The Golden Puck is the worst episode of the season. It actually manages to get the season's funniest line, but the episode itself is boring and pointless and a waste of time and animation.

The other two episodes are actually really good - Ultimate Ninja ties into the Big Brawl multi-parter on vol. 13, while the Nano episode is a nice continuation of the season 1 original. However, that's only still 2 good episodes out of 4. Fans will want this, but others should pass.",1103241600,5,1253,4.764976958525345
8022760,4,B00026L8G2,"Because of a missing episode.  The sleeve indicates that there are four episodes on the tape.  The fourth episode, ""The Golden Puck"" is not on the tape.  Those who are DVD player impaired such as myself (meaning, I don't own a DVD player), have to forget about having a complete VHS collection of TMNT episodes.  I contacted 4 Kids Entertainment about the problem.  They were very prompt in responding, and very nice.  However, when all is said and done, I still don't have ""The Golden Puck"" on VHS.

The three episodes that are on the tape are great, as usual.  Just be prepared for what you won't get when you purchase this tape.  This is a shame.  I think that the Turtles, and their VHS tape purchasing fans, deserve much better.",1098835200,3,733,4.526717557251908
