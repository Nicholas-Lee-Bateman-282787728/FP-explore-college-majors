""On Each Side"" (A Cada Lado) is quite an interesting film. It takes you along and, by the end, you are trying to figure out what the plot was, but you are satisfied anyway. Director Hugo Grosso ably captured a particular place in time and its people, creating a unique and captivating document of our times.

The story - or stories, for that matter - takes place in the cities of Victoria and Rosario, in Argentina, while a bridge to connect both cites, which are separated by the Paran River, is being constructed. This is a colossal project which will affect the lives of the people in both towns, as well as the rest of the country. The film starts just when the bridge's construction is at its first stages and ends when it opens the public. While all this takes place, we meet an assortment of characters that live at both sides of the river, and whose lives will be affected by this enterprise. The main one, we might think, is a photographer that is hired to document the construction of the bridge. Through him, we meet two other people - a thief and his lover (and accomplice) -- that were part of his past. There is a German engineer involved with the construction, who rents a room from two lonely sisters, who fight for his attention. There also an old man, who lives alone, and whose only happiness is his dog and the telephone calls from his only son. And then there are the two teenagers that are always playing on the river's bank

""On Each Side,"" as I indicated earlier, is quite an interesting film. There are people, there are situations in the form of small stories, and there is the construction of the bridge itself. They are all connected and they capture in a sincere, and, at times, majestic way, the human condition at a given time and place in our history. This is a fascinating concept, indeed, which has been described elsewhere as part of the new Argentine cinema. The film stars Milagros Alarcn, Monica Alfonso, Hctor Bidonde, and many others. The DVD also includes a discussion guide, featuring director's notes, director's biography and more. (Argentina, 2006, color, 95 min plus additional materials)

8308869,3,B001HL4KPM,"Little in this caught my attention, though it does evoke a place in the world I know nothing about. The character development is weak. We are never given a real reason to care about anyone in this film. The point seems to be something vaguely unclear about people who are separated by various things, some invisible, some emotional, some temporal. It's kind of high concept, really. But the plot is absent. The photography is good and so is the film technique.",1261958400,,460,4.691358024691358
