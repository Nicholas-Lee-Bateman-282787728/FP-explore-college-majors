7294918,5,B00ZT7T2W6,"What a story, true story.  A corrupt and criminal college teacher, lawyer, news reporters, private investigator, and incompetent students-but they were just being young and stupid.  And now Porter this piece of human garbage has been pardoned.  I wonder how many he has assaulted lately and I wonder how that lawyer is still allowed to practice.  As for news media they will never change.  At least that overly liberal and criminal worm journalism teacher, the main dispicable was kicked out of the university. Tony Porter is said to have an IQ of 50.  Well if he's anything like we see in this movie (I'm not clear if it's an actor or actually him) he definitely faked that IQ test (which had to of been administered by a psych 101 office helper) as any con man would have done. His IQ is more likely 150.  This documentary forewarns of what can happen to any good person. Prepares you to not blindly follow people in authority positions.",1435363200,5,939,4.654545454545454

7294923,1,B00ZT7T2W6,"The movie was compelling. I'm giving it one star because the courts and Law Enforcement are so corrupt and disgusting, I really didn't care that a guilty man was released, he (Porter) did do 15 years.  Dozens of truly innocent people have been exonerated during this same time period, people that were put in prison because of corrupt, racist and dirty cops that lie under oath and prosecutors and Judges that participate in all the lies to fill private prisons for profit.",1467417600,,473,4.7682926829268295

7294934,5,B00ZT7T2W6,"Eye opening and sobering look at what happens when justice is forgone  and replaced with anterior motives and hidden agendas at the expense of vulnerable members of society, often those in a social class that cannot afford adequate representation. It saddens me that this innocent man lost so many years of his life needlessly while serving time wrongfully accused for a crime he did not commit while a killer walked free. It is a tragedy that the man behind putting him there also walked off scott free without being held accountable for his aggregious actions.",1459728000,2,562,4.91578947368421
7294935,5,B00ZT7T2W6,This was well sequenced and explains how easily it is to have information manipulated in the justice system. How the poor morals of a few can devastate the innocent and reward the guilty.,1459641600,2,187,4.696969696969697

7294937,4,B00ZT7T2W6,"MURDER IN THE PARK tells the virtually unknown story of how.powerful journalists, professors, and lawyers conspired to free a clearly vicious double murderer from prison in Illinois, all to fit a self-serving narrative in which these same reports, educators, and attorneys were ""brave defenders of the innocent."" Yet this documentary, based on the amazing work of Chicago writer and PO,ice officer Marty Prieb, showed how the man who was ""publicly exonerated"" in 1999 (and shortly thereafter legally pardoned by a corrupt Governor, who would shortly end up in federal prison himself) was in fact guilty of gunning down two African-American teenagers in Chicago's Washington Park in the early 1980s,
The film uses the arrogant brags of the malefactors to show how they manipulated the system to fit their narrative....truth be damned. Then the worst sin was framing an innocent man, Alstory Simon, for the murders so someone could be blamed. It reveals interviews with the lawyer who in 2005 defended the City of Chicago against the falsely exonerated man's claim...and won to everyone's amazement. In 2014 the gutsy new States Attorney in Chicago, Anita Alvarez ordered the charges dropped against Simon. Yet too few people know this story.",1456876800,3,1240,5.267676767676767
7294938,5,B00ZT7T2W6,"Not terribly surprised by anything besides the ending.

Why anybody would take Protess's word about ANYTHING is beyond me.  That dude lies to people when he says 'hello'.  And he's old as hell.  He's so god damned old, he's the reason they call them 'protests', that's how old the S.O.B. is.  And that's old.  He's the first dude they called 'O.G.'

Anyway, aside from David Protess's geezerness (dude seriously...he was old in 82, he was old in 99, and he's old now. Stupid old fat balding white bastard...)

The bottom line is that people were rightly accused, people were wrongly accused, everybody involved is now out of prison, and, most importantly, David Protess is a decrepit old geezer who wears Depends assembled by an actual Mohican Indian.  And not the last Mohican, either.",1455494400,,786,4.849624060150376

7294940,5,B00ZT7T2W6,"This is simply an outstanding documentary or film. I have great respect for the Innocence Project and I make yearly donations to them. But OMG! They blew it on this case! I'm not gonna spoil things for you, but this is a serious film about our justice system and how things can go wrong - very wrong. All because of someone's ego.

This film will make you think. It is well-made and I recommend it highly.",1452470400,2,405,4.328947368421052
7294941,5,B00ZT7T2W6,"I think the hallmark of a good documentary is to make you have strong feelings about the subject matter.  Spoiler Alert:  I had a whole lot of super angry feelings watching this doc.  I assumed this would be another ""the stupid cops got it all wrong"" theme but that is not the case.  What started as seemingly good intentions from college students trying to free an assumed wrongly convicted man quickly became corrupted by power, greed, tunnel vision, and dreams of fame and fortune.  The miscarriage of justice in this case is stunning.",1452470400,4,538,4.741935483870968
7294942,5,B00ZT7T2W6,"First, the documentary is entertaining, breath taking and well directed  an excellent watch.  Second, for whatever reason, its also about ways how we were deceived by the media, a prestigious university and others, and ultimately, it uncovers how we want to believe the lies presented to us. I am not sure why its now acceptable for the media to more often than not report on uncorroborated facts as news, and at times, false versions to generated a bigger societal response.",1450656000,,475,4.925

7294947,5,B00ZT7T2W6,I'm not sure what to write to be honest.  I'm appauled that a professor at a prestigious university could cause so much legal damage and create a situation that allowed a guilty man to go free while stealing the freedom of an innocent man.  It appears that Protess is indeed a master manipulator and has scarred the University's Innocence Program.  One that had some ethics behind it for cases that deserved a look into.  The means do justify the outcome.  Protess and Ciolino are a disgrace.  I feel sorry for the University because they ended up getting sued.  It seems it was the most vulnerable institution to do so.  It seems like a lot of agencies were duped.  The system worked the first time and that case didn't warrant looking into.,1445126400,3,742,4.603053435114504
7294948,5,B00ZT7T2W6,"Holy F!  You MUST watch this show!!!

Absolutely a breathtaking surprise inside a plain package!  I thought this was another one of those ""Crooked cops too quickly focus on first black guy and throw him away for a murder he didn't commit.""  But they unravel the WHOLE story, backed up with documents, interviews, and ...just WOW.

I've also been a fan of the NorthWestern School of Journalism whose students have freed wrongfully imprisoned suspects, but... well, let's just say I don't like them anymore.

This is one of the RAREST documentaries where the US Justice system actually worked right THE FIRST TIME.  Then power, greed, politics, arrogance...actually manipulated the system AGAIN.  Freeing one and arresting another when...they were right all along.  Just goes to show how crappy the system (and people) are.  Even when it works correctly, they can STILL make egregious errors on the same case!

Think Ive spoiled it?  Not a chance.  You will be 10 X ticked off when you watch this.  There is so much more BS I swear I was so angry.  Glad I wasn't drinking while watching this as I probably would have thrown my drink at the TV.  I found myself screaming at the people involved in this scandal and cover-up.

There is a semi-happy ending.  You'll know what I mean.

This is NOT your typical ""Innocent man imprisoned"" documentary because, well....

You just gotta watch it.",1441497600,16,1385,4.837606837606837

7294955,1,B00ZT7T2W6,"It seemed like an unmitigated hatchet job, with enough docu-verite to have viewers believe what they're being told. The three lawyers - Ekl, Sotos and Hale - featured in the doc represent Alstory Simon in his case against Northwestern and Protess, and they're portrayed as legal experts helping us understand what really happened. They stand to make millions of dollars, they hope, if they settle the case favorably. Have to wonder, even under the documentary's notion what happened, why the Cook County State's Attorney's isn't ultimately responsible twice for botching the prosecutions.",1438905600,6,588,5.4021739130434785
7294956,4,B00ZT7T2W6,"This documentary clarifies a notoriously complicated Chicago crime, a double murder that two men confessed to separately.  It convincingly implicates the real murderer, while producing evidence that the second man was innocent, despite his confession.  In doing so, it also destroys the credibility of the Northwestern U.

8720888,4,B00ZT7T2W6,"This review contains a spoiler.

It's rare that I write a review, even rarer do I write a review for a movie.  Rarer still do I find myself throwing my fist in the air screaming ""YES!!"".  While not the subject of the movie, we get a glimpse into the higher education of our youth, and the realization that some of our colleges and universities are not educating our kids but indoctrinating them.  Of course this is nothing new, and there have always been professors of questionable character, but when a person who is supposed to be teaching ethical practices to the next generation of journalists so completely abandons those ethics and imparts his personal political views, something needs to change.  His ethics cost an innocent man many years of his life, while supposedly fighting for the unjustly convicted.

So back to the review.  I've seen better documentaries.  That's not to say this is bad.  Not at all.  In fact, I was more emotionally invested in this particular movie than most.  The problem being it wasn't until the last quarter.  To sum up, I've never been this happy to see a man I don't know
walk out of prison. And I'm referring to Simon, in case that wasn't clear.  I would also be extremely pleased to see Protess walking into prison, preferably handcuffed and crying.",1474761600,2,1291,4.709821428571429
8720889,3,B00ZT7T2W6,"This one may have people up in arms for both sides. Though from what ive seen the one star reviews and claims of ""hatchet job"". Are coming from protess' former colleagues and the like. The case for simon being innocent, and porter being the perpetrator, is SO solid i don't see how anyone can defend protess legitimately. American universities are known for playing politics and protess' tactics were so ridiculously over the lines that even his own university washed their hands of him. As for the film, its coherent, fluid, and at times compelling. My only complaint is it how fast it wrapped up in the end. Felt like i went from being fully submerged in the heat of the case, then within five minutes it made haste for the door. Couldnt added ten or 15 minutes.",1473724800,,764,4.583941605839416
8720890,5,B00ZT7T2W6,"Compelling.  Thought-provoking. Startling just how EVIL some people who are perceived to be ""do-gooders"" can be.  In this case, I feel that the truth is obvious, but I can't believe or understand how so many people aided and abetted the deconstruction of justice in this case, and felt entitled to use economically/socially-vulnerable people as pawns.  But, then again, just look at this country's history; I shouldn't be shocked.  The part of the disclaimer at the beginning of this doc about not guaranteeing the accuracy of the content gave me pause, asI feel it's an unnecssary statement.  But a well-done doc about another F-ed situation where the alleged engineer of all this f-ery simply gets his wrist slapped.  I highly recommend this doc.",1472860800,,748,5.090163934426229
