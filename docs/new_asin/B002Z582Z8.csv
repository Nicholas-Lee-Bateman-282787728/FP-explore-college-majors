8612033,5,B002Z582Z8,For both of my kids arabic is a third language after english and french. We don't speak arabic at home but we want our kids learning it. This DVD was to hard for them because there is a lot of speech in arabic not like baby einstein with small speech easier for beginner. I gave this DVD to my friend who speak arabic and english at home and she loved it. Baby Einstein DVD would be too easy for there kids.,1297555200,,407,4.037037037037037
