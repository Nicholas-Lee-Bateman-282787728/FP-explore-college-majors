8241600,5,B0011F1SH2,I've been interested in the assassinations of the 1960s since 1973. I recorded many of the documentaries on my VCR and now want to have them on DVD in my collection.,1483228800,,165,4.354838709677419
8241601,5,B0011F1SH2,A GREAT VIDEO,1458345600,,13,3.6666666666666665
8241602,4,B0011F1SH2,Lot of stuff here I didn't know. This is interesting. I would recommend this DVD. It's a little dated but that doesn't change things.,1393977600,,133,4.583333333333333
8241603,4,B0011F1SH2,"This is a good introduction to the conspiracy to murder Dr. King.  Its a bit dated but the interviews with James Earl Ray and Attorney William Pepper are worth it.  After I saw this I visited thekingcenter.org which posts the entire transcript of the King v Jowers trial.  This is a little known and little reported case of tremendous importance.  The DVD covers the infiltration of the SCLC  and King's staff with FBI informants.  It shows the rifle that was planted by Jowers outside his restaurant so that the police could not miss it.  The Memphis police are questioned about the order to pull back their security right before the murder.  It also traces Ray to Canada and then England where he is arrested.  If you want to understand the basics of how covert assassinations are planned and executed, this is a good start.",1371945600,2,826,4.680555555555555
8241604,5,B0011F1SH2,"This film is a powerful, no-holds barred look at who really killed Martin Luther King--an issue as relevant today as it was 40 years ago. This is an intensely detailed, exhaustively researched and artfully rendered film that should be required watching for anyone who wants to see what real documentary filmmaking is.",1236643200,5,317,5.115384615384615
