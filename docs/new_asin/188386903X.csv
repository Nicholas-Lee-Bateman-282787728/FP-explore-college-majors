7800848,5,188386903X,"2000 RELEASE-Alcatraz Prison, infamous as America's Devils Island, was considered one of the toughest prisons in America. The Prison that housed the worst criminals of their generation such as Al Capote and Baby Face Nelson. Surrounded by icy, shark invested water, deadly currents, Alcatraz known as the ""ROCK"" was considered escape-proof. Despite these overwhelming obsctacles, 34 men dared death and tried to escape to freedom. ""Escape from Alcatraz"" follows the ROCK's most infamous escape attempts -- some brilliante, some outrageous, and some acts of pure desperation. Discover the escape routes, and learn if the prisoners escaped or perished in the rocky waters of San Francisco Bay. Produced for Discovery Channel in 1995. Michael Hoff Productions, Inc. has produced three documentaries on the history of Alcatraz island.
