The DVD itself is definitley for someone who has NEVER done pilates before =  it does an excellent job showing proper form of basic moves - but that's all -- it also has a segment that shows how to use (and has a basic workout) for the ""Magic Circle"" -- so if you don't have a magic circle -- this section is wasted.",1249776000,,387,4.287671232876712
2808741,5,B000P2XNI4,"Have done Jennifer Kries Pilates workouts for years. Started out 10 years ago with the VHS tapes.  Over all the workout is VERY tough in the beginning... you will be so sore if not already doing a toning workout.  And takes alittle time to get down the pilates and basic ballet toning moves.  But Kries is so worth the time to learn and work through sore muscles.  I'm never in such good shape if using on weekly basic and if I slide alittle, tone back very quickly.  My all time favorite workout is her Pilates,""The Method"".  With it made in 90's... outfits some what dated!  But look past that, the over all workout is still better than most pilates I have found.",1228608000,9,665,4.401639344262295
2808742,5,B000P2XNI4,"If you are looking for a workout that makes you feel taller and leaner then Jennifer Kries has a lot to offer. In ""New Body Pilates"" the Goddess of Pilates guides you through two workouts. While this is for beginners there are still some challenges for intermediates. In the first workout you may recognize these classic exercises:

Roll-Ups
Leg Circles
Rolling like a Ball
Double Leg Stretch
Bridge
Spine Stretch Forward
Side Series
Bent Leg Teaser
Seal

Jennifer Kries' nurturing teaching style keeps you focused while you feel like you are exercising with a personal trainer. Most of the exercises have modifications so you never feel that you have to push your body further than it will let you go.

In the second workout, the creative use of a magic circle (looks like a steering wheel) gives your thighs an excellent workout. When you stand up after this workout you can literally feel the results. Both workouts give you better posture and help you to slim, tone and sculpt your entire body.

2808743,5,B000P2XNI4,"Whatever Jennifer is teaching, I want to learn it!  Her confidence, her depth of knowledge (of anatomy, energy and Pilates itself), her experience and encouragement shine through every exercise and every explanation.  I've never been able to say this about an instructor on a fitness dvd, but it is an honor to call her my teacher.  That I trust her so completely has enabled me (right from the start) to begin to trust my own body in a way that I never have before&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jennifer-Kries-New-Body-Pilates-Beginners-Mat-Workout/dp/B000P2XNI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jennifer Kries: New Body Pilates - Beginners Mat Workout</a>&nbsp;and that has allowed me to make unbelievable progress.
""Class"" begins with proper breathing techniques and the fundamentals of Pilates.  Jennifer's ""students"" demonstrate correct (as well as incorrect) poses, advanced beginner as well as basic beginner, and although I am more of an intermediate Pilates practioner, Jennifer's meticulous cueing sometimes ""catches"" me doing something incorrectly and underscores the importance in Pilates (and everything in life) of getting the fundamentals right.  Her manner of teaching is so personal, so natural and assured that although she is teaching by way of a dvd, somehow I feel as if she is speaking directly to me.

You can see by their spontaneous smiles that Jennifer's  ""students"" admire her and are also having fun.  Her teaching has the same effect on me!  (I think if she could see me she would be genuinely pleased.)

I'm new to the innocent-looking Magic Circle and I can honestly say that it gives me the fastest (10 or so minutes) and most complete upper and lower body workout I've ever experienced.  Jennifer calls it a ""handy-dandy"" tool and considering that I feel as if I am going to die while I am using it, (only kidding!) I believe she is correct.

The New Body! Pilates DVD itself is movie quality.  Sometimes I actually find myself watching and listening when I should be doing the Hundred or the Seal.  I'm happily going to purchase&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jennifer-Kries-Hot-Body-Cool-Mind-Level-1/dp/B000IU37W0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jennifer Kries: Hot Body Cool Mind - Level 1</a>&nbsp;and any other workouts Jennifer Kries has done while I anxiously await her intermediate New Body!

2808744,4,B000P2XNI4,"NOTE.  The Pilates segments on this DVD appear on previously released Jennifer Kries videos:  the main Pilates workout is from Hot Body Cool Mind Level 1, and the bonus Pilates Magic Circle segment is from Hot Body Cool Mind Waking Energy.

The main workout on this DVD is a 34-minute Pilates matwork sequence.  Jennifer Kries, who is instructing three background exercisers, starts by providing an overview with basic Pilates principles, including breathing and form--an important feature for those new to Pilates.  Following this, Jennifer leads the class through a fairly standard mat practice which mostly follows classical Pilates sequencing, although she adds some stretches, decreases the repetitions, shows modifications, and performs only 3 of the Series of 5 exercises. Overall, this workout is most appropriate for beginners, although Jennifer includes some good form reminders that even more experienced Pilates practitioners may find useful.

Also included on this DVD is a 14-minute bonus Pilates Magic Circle segment:  here Jennifer instructs one male and one female background exerciser in a nice little full-body workout using the Pilates circle or ring. The first half is performed in a standing position, first working the upper body with the ring between your hands, then the lower with the ring between your legs.  There were some unique variations here that I haven't seen in other Pilates ring workouts. The second half of this workout is a short matwork sequence.  Jennifer has her assistants perform abbreviated versions of Pilates exercises, such as the hundred and the rollup, and she includes with a single exercise from the Pilates side kick series.  Because the ring makes the moves a little more challenging, the level of this workout was slightly more difficult than the main workout, more of an experienced beginner level.

In summary, if you are looking for a basic beginning Pilates mat workout with plenty of instruction and form pointers, this DVD might fit the bill.  However, as mentioned above, keep in mind that the Pilates segments here were previously released on other DVDs, and Jennifer frequently refers to those other workouts.",1191283200,47,2174,5.287790697674419

8188679,3,B000P2XNI4,"I respect Jennifer Kries deeply as an instructor. Having practiced pilates since age 13, she is highly accomplished and it shows. She is concerned with correct technique and tradition, rather than 'instant weight loss'. Her approach is theoretical and precise, but you still feel welcomed into the pilates practice.

There are 2 workouts on this DVD: Magic Circle and Mat. I don't own a magic circle (does any beginner?) so my review is based solely on the Mat workout, which I did today for the first time. If you've ever done a pilates workout, there will be no surprises here -- all the movements are faithful to the original pilates method. Jennifer pauses between each set to explain the science of each exercise, so the workout never really picks up momentum. I did about 15 minutes of cardio before working out with this DVD to ensure my body was ready to work, but still I didn't break a sweat or feel challenged in any way when I was done. I didn't 'buzz' like I usually do after a good workout. Maybe some mild strengthening did take place, but I wasn't taken out of my comfort zone. I appreciate the educational content on this DVD, but physically I doubt this will take me to the next level. I'll work with it for a few weeks, because I've bought this DVD and I want to get the most out of it, but I wouldn't recommend it for someone who wants to lose weight or get fit. I'm still curious about Jennifer's other DVDs and I've heard that they are less theoretical, so I'll check those out before dismissing Jennifer Kries altogether.",1388707200,7,1544,4.534050179211469

  This is a well thought - out , pleasant start for a complete beginner unto Pilates.

out-and - out Professional Dancer,
she is kind, humble and patient. A splendid  Workout.
  I love buying through recommendations, and Mrs. Anne Barone , who has my grateful thanks, is right in  praising this teacher.

8188681,3,B000P2XNI4,This video is way too basic for me.  I probably won't use it again.  She talks too much and doesn't demonstrate most of the moves.,1360454400,3,130,4.16

After one month I'm seeing great results and feel wonderful.  The 10 minute Magic Circle section for body toning requires purchasing the Magic Circle device and is well worth the money.  The whole workout takes about 45 minutes.  I highly recommend it.",1335657600,,514,5.0
8188684,5,B000P2XNI4,"This DVD is great for those new to Pilates or who want a  refresher. The instructor, Jennifer Kries, does a wonderful job at explaining the moves (which are basic Pilates exercises) and places a great deal of emphasis on correct form. For this reason I gave the DVD 5 stars. However, instruction takes up a lot of time during the routine. I can imagine that once viewers have the basics down, they'll want to perform the routine without the DVD rather than be slowed down by instruction and pauses. The DVD also includes a Pilates ring workout which I haven't tried yet so I won't comment on it.

Other reviews have noted that Jennifer doesn't demonstrate the exercises. This is correct but there is a separate participant which demonstrates the moves along with someone else showing modifications.

Another plus, Jennifer has a pleasant voice and is very articulate, which doesn't seem to be to common in workout videos.

FYI: This workout is also on Hot Body Cool Mind Level 1.",1335571200,4,979,4.741176470588235
8188685,1,B000P2XNI4,"This was by far the most irritating dvd I have ever used. Instead of having a brief introduction that explains the proper breathing techniques and form, she literally talks nonstop throughout each movement and constantly stops the people demonstrating the moves to explain the ""right"" and ""wrong"" way of doing the current move. This is a total joke if you are wanting an actual workout.

  After watching the first ten minutes without her having you do anything, I became totally bored and I don't think she actually did any of the moves herself. She just sat on a chair in the center and talked, and talked, and talked! I used to use the Living Arts Pilates vhs tapes with Ana Caban as the instructor, but when I compared the reviews, I decided to switch to Jennifer Kries. Big mistake! I just ordered Ana Caban's Pilates dvds and will be using hers instead!",1326067200,5,859,4.6381578947368425
