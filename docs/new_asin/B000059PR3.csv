1409147,4,B000059PR3,"I am a Fulci fan and I have to say that this movie is a very good one.  It's definitely not his best one but it really is very creepy.  Its about this family moving into a temporary home for a while.  While they are there, the visitors of the house all get slaughtered, except for our hero, a very geeky looking kid who you really want to punch in the face he's so annoying.  Later on they find that the killer is Dr. Freudstein, who has been killing people so he can use their living tissue to keep himself alive.  Some very creepy moments, especially some of the visions the boy and this other girl have.  Also, I have been informed that this is the uncut, unrated version of the film so ignore the R rating on the back of the box.  This means its full of some really grotesque footage and will please fulci fans for sure.  Plus, this price just can be beat and the transfer is professionally done and suprisingly good for a Diamond Entertainment Release.  A Recommended buy.",975369600,9,977,4.295081967213115
1409148,4,B000059PR3,"I was expecting a bad quality DVD for the price,but hey it was a great surprise to find a excellent print. It is in widescreen and is totally uncut,the more gore the better as far as im concerned. I give this 4 stars as for the price its a bargain,if it had 5.1 surround it would of got 5 stars no problem. If you love horror then i recommend this dvd with no hesitation,as they don't make films like this anymore.",975283200,,414,4.1234567901234565
1409149,4,B000059PR3,"Considering Diamond Entertainment's reputation for low-end releases and Amazon's bargain basement price for this DVD, I was fully expecting a poor quality disc.  However, I'm pleased to report that this was actually a great buy!  The picture and sound transfer are very good, the film is in its original widescreen format and, most important of all, it's uncut!  Granted, there is a lack of extras (you get a one page bio on Lucio Fulci and that's about it), but I'm more than pleased with the film itself and that's what matters most to me.",973900800,6,541,4.73404255319149
1409150,2,B000059PR3,"I would actually give this movie a 2 1/2 stars.  Out of all the recent Italian Horror movies that my friend has bought recently, this is by far the best one yet.  It does have the suspence that a good horror should have.  The makeup isn't bad either.  I would also say that parents need to review the movie for themselves, prior to letting their children watch it, as it is very grusome, and gory.  The movie portrays a couple of movies and gave them thier start.  One of those movies would be ""The Sixth Sense"".  By the time the movie comes to an end, you are cheering for the little boy.",973555200,3,589,4.205357142857143

1409152,4,B000059PR3,"After a fantastic start which has definite echos of 'The Shining', this film ups the gore content leaving you feel quite sick by the end.  As ever, Fulci treats us to a multitude of strong gore scenes, inculding the most ridiculous bat attack ever filmed!  Not as good as 'Zombie' but better than 'The Black Cat' or 'The Beyond' (which I don't particularly like), House has soem great performances, some cheesy, but hey, what where you expecting? If you are ven slightly interested in the 'golden era' of Fulci horror then you wil want to check this movie out, i doubt that you will be disappointed.",970963200,5,599,4.6415094339622645

1409155,5,B000059PR3,"I run an instagram page @fulltimehorrorjunkie where I watch and review horror movies. I have been watching House By the Cemetery almost on repeat since I was in high-school. Its confusing narrative, graphic violence, beautiful atmosphere, gothic influence, and overall spookiness makes rewatching this classic easy. Owning it on Blu-Ray is a must since the transfer is fresh and clear. It is a purposefully ambiguous story, so some people will hate it while others will absolutly ADORE it -like me",1478563200,2,497,5.225

1409158,5,B000059PR3,"I love this movie!!  Fulci always sets the perfect mood.  The film is pretty kitschy in parts, but that just adds to it's charm -- a charm you won't appreciate if you don't enjoy the Italian horror masters of the 70's and 80's.  Turn off the lights and enjoy!!",1474156800,,260,4.26530612244898
1409159,5,B000059PR3,"Maybe Fulci's best horror film.  Has both gore and interesting plot twists and builds to a fantastic ending.  Fulci deserves credit for doing one of those endings where the tension just mounts and mounts and just won't let you off the hook.  There is a technic that he masters here of letting you think you're not going to see something and then he plunges you back into it.

One downfall this movie has is kind of poor dubbing into English.  The little kid has one of the most annoying voices ever to be heard in a film.  The beginning of this film is very much like PSYCHO TWO--this film came before that one and it's probably just a coincidence.",1471824000,,648,4.4033613445378155

1409161,4,B000059PR3,"For fans of Italian-directed horror it gets little better than this, as Lucio Fulci moves from zombie gore to haunted house gore with this feature. Containing numerous original and artistic flourishes now belatedly being recognized by some mainstream critics, this one looks gorgeous as Fulci's cameras float over spring-like scenery into the gloom of a country house where some sort of killer lurks. Plot coherence and exact explanations are rarely the point with Fulci, and there is little exception here. Instead, the storyline's uncertainty adds to the overall atmosphere of eerie strangeness that Fulci creates in his films, as if the viewer is experiencing a slow-moving and very uneasy dream. Then the bursts of gory violence strike, and  while some claim to see these as ""campy fun,"" they are actually quite disturbing as violence is supposed to be. Only brief and dubious attempts at investigation and rationalization are made, and then it's back to the unsettling atmospherics. Now, no review of this film would be complete without addressing ""Bob,"" the annoying little boy character, or at least the annoyingly DUBBED little boy character. In my opinion the only sore thumb that really sticks out about him is his name - who would call a small boy ""Bob"" instead of the much more natural ""Bobby""? Other than that, his weirdness and even his annoyingness fit in with the film's overall eccentricities, which mark it distinctly as a Fulci work and a classic of its kind.",1462147200,,1478,5.057377049180328
1409162,1,B000059PR3,"The bat scene is one of the funniest scenes I've ever whitenesed! The best black humor money could buy, but the rest of the film was nonsensical horse puck. Neither funny, nor scary. Just convoluted schlock. However, the mummified face of the zombie was kinda cute. Give us a big kiss, junior! SMACK!! Truly, the only frightening part of the film was Bob: the he-she boy that won't stop yelling MOMMY MOMMY! I was ready to throw my boot at screen!",1461110400,,447,4.530864197530864
1409163,3,B000059PR3,"Where do I begin to explain this literal cheese fest?
Is it a slasher movie, a ghost story, a Frankenstein. (err I mean Freudstein) or just a very strange paranormal movie? It starts off as a slasher movie, with a young woman's bare breasts, popping right in your face. It then, just changes to a haunted house story, to a ghost story and back to a slasher film again. Fans of infamous Italian horror director Dario Argento, will probably enjoy some of the blood soaked scenes, music and cinematography of director Lucio Fulci , that strongly resemble some of his best works. Anyway, lets delve into this assorted cheese platter, shall we?
The house is not by the cemetery, it IS the cemetery. The fact that anyone would want to live in a creepy old Victorian mansion that not only is built over and around a cemetery but actually has people buried in tombs inside is beyond me? When Mrs. Boyle's husband nonchalantly explains that in the winter in Boston, the ground is too cold and hard ""like a rock"" outside to bury the dead outside, so they just buried their dead inside instead. Stating that ""many old homes around here do it"", she simply accepts it. Yet, just minutes before she finds the dusty old tomb in the middle of her living room, the basement door almost shook itself off of the hinges, leaving poor Mrs. Boyle to let out, not one, but two long , bloodcurdling screams of terror. When Professor Boyle returns home from work, she is curled up in a ball by the tomb in her living room, crying in hysterics. It takes only mere seconds to regain her composure and to just calmly accept her husband's explanation. My question is, why the hell didn't she say ""oh and by the way, something very evil is living in our basement?"". The vampire bat scene is long and hilarious. The bat looks so fake and there is so much blood that it is just laughable. Another question comes to mind, why if the mother, Mrs. Boyle is ""on vacation"" at home, basically doing nothing all day, except a little light sweeping and finding tombs in her living room, would they need to hire a creepy young babysitter, who by the way, looks a lot like 80's pop icon Laura Branigan ( God rest her soul)? The director, Lucio Fulci , must think that we can't be trusted as viewers to remember something from just mere minutes ago, so they have to keep flashing back and forth. Yes, we get it, the house is the same picture as the one in their house in New York. Yes, the little girl is the same creepy little girl in the window in the picture in New York, when they arrive in Boston. Yes, the babysitter looks exactly like the creepy mannequin in the store window. It's like the director must think we are morons? The Professor ( Mr. Boyle) hears very strange noises in the night, so he goes to check on his sleeping son, who is peacefully, fast asleep in a fetal position, but that doesn't stop him from doing something completely unnecessary and a bit strange. He totally pulls back the sheets, pulls his legs down and re-positions him before pulling the sheets back up over him? I mean, was that really necessary? He acts like he wants to keep the child peacefully sleeping, but yet, as he hears another strange noise, he runs out of the bedroom slamming the door? Like that wouldn't wake the kid? Let's talk about this strange kid for a minute. From the very second he opens his mouth , it is disturbing. Yes, I know it is an Italian film dubbed in English, but why would they use an adult's voice instead of a child's? It is just off-putting. It reminds me of the bad adult for a child's voice, overdub in Halloween II . I always thought that it was strange in the flashback. Anyway, Professor Boyle finds the creepy Laura Branigan lookalike trying to pry open the basement door that is boarded up and nailed shut, which won't do her any good anyway, since the door needs a key and then a strong man and a knife to pry the old rusty lock open (and later, an axe). The good professor doesn't even say ""WTF are you doing, trying to pry open my doors in the night, waking the whole house up""? They just exchange strange looks without a sound, with close up shots of the eyes, which remind me of a music video from the 80's. How about the next morning when the creepy, Laura Branigan look alike babysitter is on her hands and knees trying, not so obviously, to clean up a ton of blood from the realtor, Gittleson ? Mrs. Boyle does not even raise an eyebrow about the blood fest in front of her. The babysitter throws her off any possible questioning by simply saying ""I made coffee"" which seems like a good enough explanation for the carnage in her kitchen for Mrs. Boyle??? Well for no apparent and never explained reason, the professor burns the only recorded evidence of Dr. Freudstein 's bloody history. The mysterious and creepy babysitter, who you are led to think has something to do with everything, I guess actually does not, and meets her foreshadowed fate (as the decapitated mannequin in the store window, from earlier in the movie). We see very cheap and cheesy light up eyes in the dark basement, that are laughable, at best.
THere was never an explanation for Bob's creepy girlfriend, that obviously was the ghost of the slaughtered Freudstein family.
Eventually you get to meet Dr. Freudstein , who is just barely alive and looks more like a space alien from Doctor Who, than an undead denizen. When he is stabbed by professor Boyle, it's stew and maggots for everyone.
Lots more gore, blood, bad acting and then the ghost of Mrs. and May Freudstein appears and little Bob walks away with them, hand in hand without a care after the brutal slaughter of his parents??? The sad thing is that even a three year old, could have totally kicked Dr. Freudstein 's ass, as he could barely walk, only had one arm and was basically dead.
So, if you like watching 90 minutes of steamy Italian cheese, and don't care that nothing you watched makes any sense or has much of an explanation, then ""The House By The Cemetery"" is waiting.. for YOU!",1461024000,,6024,4.4772727272727275

1409166,5,B000059PR3,"For some movies, the transfer to Blu-Ray Hi-Def is troublesome because it reveals too much detail and ruins the mystery by revealing the tools of the trade. I disagree with that for this film.  All the previous releases were so faded that he blood looked fake and the wounds looked plastic.  However, with hi-def color and contrast...the gore looks quite realistic and unsettling!  Also, the film quality looks crisp and doesn't look like it came from the TV.

1409167,4,B000059PR3,"This is #2 on my Fulci marathon and it was a pleasure, a guilty pleasure but a pleasure none the less. The dialogue and English dubbing are atrocious, the blood and gore gratuitous, it lacks logic and the editing is just plain bad. (Apparently this is status quo for Fulci.) I swear they did most of the scenes in just one take and said, ""Yeah, that's good enough. Next scene!"" So why the 4 stars? Because it's entertaining as hell and just plain fun. Somehow, Fulci was able to use all of these un-finessed elements and create a damn good, atmospheric and satisfying horror story. I'm starting to believe that the lack of logic is an intentional device because as your mind tries to make sense of it, you're hit suddenly with graphic violence and it's shocking. I found myself laughing at the oddest things too, like I thought it was hilarious that the little boys name was ""Bob"" and not ""Bobby"". *Spoiler* BTW, to the person that complained that the ending was dumb, I thought so too at first. Later I realized that the ""Bob"" was actually murdered in the end and didn't escape from the zombie. He went off with the little girl as a spirit after his death. And that's how a horror story is supposed to end. Can't wait to watch the rest of Fulci's films! Supposedly I've yet to see his better films.",1442016000,,1299,4.46218487394958

1409180,5,B000059PR3,"WARNING SPOILERS!!!!! This is another one of director Lucio Fulci's early-'80s horror films, known better for its scenes of bloody gore rather than plot. As a matter of fact, the story makes little-to-no sense, but has some extremely bloody set-pieces.
  The film opens in the cobweb-filled Boston home (actually lensed in Concord, Massachusetts; the same house used in the Italian horror film GHOSTHOUSE - 1987) once owned by Dr. Freudstein, as a young woman (Daniela Doria) is looking for her boyfriend after using the abandoned house for a place to have sex. She finds her boyfriend's mutilated body and then she is on the receiving end of a butcher knife to the back of her head (the blade juts out of her mouth!).
  A new family is moving into the Freudstein home: Lucy Boyle (Catriona MacColl; THE BEYOND - 1981), husband Dr. Norman Boyle (Paolo Malco; THE NEW YORK RIPPER - 1982) and their young son Bob (Giovanni Frezza; MANHATTAN BABY - 1982), Bob is looking at a photo of the Freudstein home and sees a young girl peering out of one of the windows. When Lucy looks at the photo, she is not there. Norman and his family are moving into the house from New York City (where many Italian horror films from this period start out) after a colleague, Peterson (whom we never see), committed suicide while working on a top-secret ""project"" (which is never fully explained). Norman is taking over the project (Lucio Fulci maskes a cameo as ""Professor Muller"" as he and Norman are walking down a NYC street discussing why he has to go to Boston) and he is taking his family with him (not a good idea!).
  After making the drive to Boston, The Boyles stop at real estate agent Laura Gittleson's (Dagmar Lassander; THE BLACK CAT - 1980) office to pick up the keys to their new home. While Bob is waiting in the car, he strikes up a conversation with little girl Mary Freudstein (Silvia Collatina; THE GREAT ALLIGATOR - 1979), the little girl he saw in the window of the photo, who may be a ghost (Earlier in the film, we see Mary staring at a female mannequin in a store window, which then loses its head when it falls down on a piece of broken window glass. Why does the mannequin bleed?). Laura tells the Boyles that they will have to follow her to their new home, since it is hard to find and in the middle of the woods.
  Once in their new home, Lucy almost immediately has terrifying visions. Ann (Ania Pieroni; TENEBRE - 1982), their new nanny, looks exactly like the headless mannequin (Why is Lucy having the same visions as Mary?). Norman has set up an office in their new home and, that night, he hears a child crying, but when he checks up on Bob, he finds him sound asleep. He then hears Lucy trying to pry open the boards blocking the basement door (What's behind the door?).
  The next morning, Norman goes to the local library, where he talks to librarian Daniel Douglas (Gianpaolo Saccarola; THE BEYOND - 1981). Daniel has some papers belonging to his late colleague Peterson, who was doing research on Dr. Freudstein. Daniel then tells Norman that Peterson hanged himself in this very library (he shows him where). While cleaning the hallway, Lucy discovers a stone grave marker under a rug that belongs to Jacob & Tess Freudstein (Why were they buried inside the house?). Lucy then hears someone (or something) trying to break free from the tomb. She also hears other noises, such as a child crying, that makes her scream in terror. When Norman gets home, he discovers Lucy cowering in the hallway, crying. He then decides to open the basement door to prove to Lucy that there is nothing evil down there. After having problems opening the door (the lock is nearly rusted shut), he is able to go downstairs to the basement, where he finds a mens gold wedding ring (he puts it in his pocket). Almost immediately, he and Lucy are attacked by a very angry bat and Norman must use a pair of scissors to stab the bat to get it off his hand (The blood from the bat spraying on Lucy and Bob's faces). Norman and Lucy then go to Laura's office to ask for a new place to live, but Laura's assistant tells them she is not there (she is). Later on, Laura goes to see Norman and Lucy to see what the problem is (She has been getting plenty of complaints from previous residents), but when she gets to the house, no one is there (that she knows about). While Laura is looking for the Boyles, she steps on the stone grave marker, breaks it and a grunting and moaning figure stabs her in the chest and neck with a large metal spike (very graphic) and drags her bloody body down to the basement. The next morning, we see Ann cleaning the blood off the floor (Lucy: ""What are you doing?"" Ann: ""I made coffee!"").
  Meanwhile, Norman does some research on Dr. Freudstein and discovers that he was an early-20th Century doctor with a ""penchant for illegal experiments"" and gets a cassette tape from Daniel where we hear Peterson say ""Blood! Blood! I can hear it everywhere!"" (WTF?!?). Norman tells Lucy that he will have to make a short trip to NYC to do some further research.
  We then see Bob playing with Mary in a cemetery next to the house (we see Mary's gravestone). Then we see Bob playing with a remote-controlled car inside the house and loses it when it accidentally falls into the basement, so he goes down to collect it. Ann goes down to the cellar to look for Bob and the door locks behind her. Someone (or something) slices her throat over and over with a butcher knife (another very gory scene). Bob, who is not in the basement, goes looking for Ann in the basement and discovers her decapitated head (just like Mary & Lucy's vision). When Lucy gets home from food shopping, she finds Bob crying in his bedroom. He tells his mother what he saw, so Lucy goes down in the basement and finds nothing.
  Norman is now at a cemetery in New York City looking for the tomb of Dr. Freudstein (What about the marker in the hallway?), but the cemetery caretaker (Elmer Johnsson) tells Norman that Dr. Freudstein is not buried there and he is not the only person to make that mistake (What could this possibly mean?).
  That night, Bob goes down to the basement (Bob: ""Ann? Mother told me you are not dead. Is that true?"") and sees a glowing pair of eyes staring back at him. He runs up the stairs, only to find the door locked. Lucy tries to open the door, but breaks the key off in the lock. Norman shows up and breaks the door down with an axe (A hand holds Bob's head to the door hoping the axe blade will slice into his head and split his skull open, but no such luck). We then discover the mutated corpse of Dr. Freudstein lives in the basement (Bob discovers the bloody corpses of Ann and Laura hanging from the rafters). Norman stabs Dr. Freudstein with a knife (maggots come pouring out of the wound) before it rips Norman's throat with its bare hands (another memorable scene). Lucy and Bob try to escape through the cracked grave marker, but Dr. Freudstein drags Lucy to her death. Just when it looks like curtains for Bob, Mary lifts him out of the grave marker and Mrs. Freudstein takes him outside. Is Bob dead? It's hard to say, as the film ends with this quotation: ""No one will ever know whether children are monsters or monsters are children"" - Henry James.
  Like I said in the beginning of this review, the film makes very little sense, but the gore flows rather freely. There is no explanation on why Dr. Freudstein looks the way he does, or even if it is Dr. Freudstein at all, except to say that he was fond of ""illegal experiments"". What sort of illegal experiments? I guess we can only speculate, as the film offers us no explanations. The screenplay, by Fulci, Giorgio Mariuzzo (CONTRABAND - 1980) & Dardano Sacchetti (DEVIL FISH - 1984; CUT AND RUN - 1985) tips its hat to H.P. Lovecraft, but I believe even ol'  H.P. would be scratching his head trying to figure it out. To show you how confusing this film really is, when Vestron Video released this on VHS, they showed two reels of film out of order and very few people noticed! Lucio Fulci does give this film a nice atmospheric sheen, which was one of the things he was a master at. The exteriors were filmed in Concord, Massachusetts, but all the interiors were shot at the De Paolis Studios in Rome, Italy. The fact that they do not look like sets, imbues this film with a dark tone that only Fulci could pull off. It may not make any sense, but it is a great film to look at.
  Originally released theatrically in the U.S. Unrated in 1984 by Almi Films, with a fullscreen VHS release from Vestron Video shortly thereafter. An edited fullscreen budget DVD in 2003 from Legacy Entertainment and a widescreen uncut version on DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment followed, but the beautiful-looking Blu-Ray from Blue Underground is the only way to view this film. I saw it theatrically in the mid-'80s and I can honestly say that the Blu-Ray looks better. The extras on the Blu-Ray are second-to-none, as there is a great original featurette called ""Meet The Boyles"" where the lovely Catriona MacColl and the rugged Paolo Malco reminisce about making this film. They recall Fulci as always yelling on set, being a bit of a sadist to his actors and not liking children. On another extra on the disc, an interview with the adult Giovanni Frezza, he seems to back up their claims. I especially like the TV trailer for this film, where Brother Theodore narrates in his typical overwrought manner, making the film seem more sinister than it actually is. I remember seeing this trailer on TV and love that it was included here (there is also an international trailer and the U.S. theatrical trailer included on the disc). Also on the disc is an extended scene of the bat attack, which has never been seen before. I applaud Blue Underground for giving this film the deluxe treatment and urge everyone to buy this disc. Also starring Carlo De Mejo (TERROR EXPRESS - 1979), Giovanni De Nava (MURDER-ROCK: DANCING DEATH - 1984) as the mutated Dr. Freudstein (if that is who he is supposed to be) and Teresa Rossi Passante as Mrs. Freudstein.

1409181,4,B000059PR3,"Atmospheric elements are laden on with a trowel, thick and sloppy, done in haste.  There is nothing subtle about this movie.  It is a supernatural thriller that works overtime to remain creepy even as it makes no sense whatsoever.  Dr. Norman Boyle (Paolo Malco) drags his family with him when he sets off on a job doing research.  They take temporary residence in a house with a dramatic past.  Their son Bob (poorly dubbed to sound like an adult trying to sound like a child) is haunted by a little girl (Silvia Collatina) even before they set off on their ill-fated adventure.  The house in question is eerie, complete with a locked door boarded up for good measure (never a good sign).  It's hinted that mom (Catriona MacColl) has issues and hasn't been taking her PILLS.  Her husband appears permanently sneaky, especially while eyeballing the new babysitter.  (There's one hysterical moment when I thought we switched genres as the scene cuts between extreme close-ups of the babysitter's eyes, Norman's eyes, and his wife's eyes.  I expected someone to start whistling any minute!)  Naturally, the sinister door is finally opened and reveals a killer bat that takes a liking to Norman's hand.  After that, the bodies start to pile up even as no one seems to notice people have gone missing (to say nothing of the stench involved in decomposition!).  Ghoul design notwithstanding, this is a very disjointed and uneven fright-fest.  Only some of the elements work some of the time.  Starting with the fact that the infamous cellar never seems to appear the same way twice.  It gets bigger or smaller, filled with light or doused in darkness, never following the rules of logic or construction!  As ghost stories go, this one tries but doesn't always succeed in following a single line of thought.  Still, seeing Dr. Freudstein in his element was good enough to keep for future viewings.",1411430400,5,1891,4.87460815047022

1409188,2,B000059PR3,"(Review of Lucio Fulci's ""House by the Cemetery."")  I have enjoyed watching other Fulci (and Dario Argento) supernatural flicks repeated times over the years, including ""The Beyond/Seven Doors of Death"", ""Zombie"", ""City of the Living Dead"",and ""Four of the Apocalypse"", and Argento's ""Susperia"" (debatably, not a B-flick), and ""The Church.""  I finally picked this one up on the strength of the more-recent reviews, understanding full well that it is B-genre by definition.

But this was exasperatingly boring and painfully bad, stretching out each hokey, extremely poorly dubbed scene foooorrreeevvverrr. And by god, [a sort-of spoiler follows:] the real monster was the boy, Bob, that just wouldn't be killed already,...a B-movie-kind-of-irony, is to be noticed on this in the epilogue post-script. Mommy-poorest takes a close second here.

Oh, what script? You could almost hear the director saying, ""it doesn't matter, just say or do this now while the make up effects guy does his thing."" Bob's dubbing had to be by a kid who wasn't allowed to actually watch the flick.  Fulci really let out a foul smelling piece of film here.  Still, I'll probably re-watch it for the right moment in need of badness.  As another reviewer put it, I am rating by the B-flick genre, but I also have to rate it relative to other Fulci/Argento flicks mentioned, so 2 stars.  Because, after all, such a bad flick, can't be all that bad. Silly us.",1398729600,2,1430,5.029661016949152

1409194,5,B000059PR3,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS

The titular abode is a creepy old mansion with a neighboring graveyard in which resides a researcher who's undertaking a professional  investigation concerning a certain Dr. William Freudstien, an 18th century physician who was ""banned from the medical profession"" on account of strange and unorthodox experiments he'd conducted, his lovely wife who isn't thrilled with the house and it's macabre surroundings, his young son named Bob, a creepy little boy ( who, I'll note, happens to resemble a mini version of the actor Klaus Kinski ) with a little monkey doll named Yogi for a companion and a remote control toy car, and Bob's sitter Ann.
A procession of weird, inexplicable and ultimately horrible occurrences unfold since they settle in. A large tomb built into the floor of the kitchen ( of all places !! ) is discovered!!  The father is attacked by a vicious bat from the newly opened basement!! Bob acquires a mysterious little girl named May for a playmate who repeatedly and ominously warns him ""DON'T GO INSIDE!!!!""!! The inexplicable sounds of a child weeping are occasionally heard!! A terrifying audio cassette made by one of the former residents ( who, it happens, had either been gruesomely murdered or went mad )is found!!  And, last but not least, there is, it seems, a secret fourth inhabitant who lives in the basement and gruesomely murders those who stumble into it's sphere!!  This basement dwelling assailant is ultimately revealed to be a grotesque creature of ambiguous origin with a tall lanky lumbering figure and what resembles the head of a somewhat decomposed space alien which bleeds maggots!!

As filmmaker Lucio Fulci's films from his infamous and now historical horror/gore era go, this House by the Cemetery is what I consider to be the best of the bunch artistically. It features good cinematography, eerie atmosphere and setting, an excellent musical score, good acting ( for the most part ), and has both suspense and shocks.

HBTC features some of Fulci's best work as a director. His talent and brilliance is particularly displayed in this film. The best scene, in my opinion, has Bob locked in the basement and hysterically pounding on the door shouting ""Momy!!!!!! Get me out of here!!!!!!!!"" while the monster is slowly ascending the stairs ( his foot steps and creepy moans being audible ) and his mom and dad, on the other side of the door, are urgently attempting to open it. Finding the lock to be jammed, the father resolves to chop the door down with an axe, and tells Bob to back away from the door. Just as Bob replies that he's at a safe distance and that dad can go ahead and start chopping it, the monster, having reached him, suddenly grabs Bob's head, shoves it against the door and keeps it pressed against it while dad chops though it ( !!! ). It then looks as though Bob gets chopped by the axe ( he screams, tumbles down the stairs, there's blood on the axe blade and on the floor ), . .. but then, a moment later, it is revealed that it is the monster who has been mutilated ( his arm having been chopped off ).

The murders are very graphically depicted, as one would expect from a Fulci film, and are also very well done at that. It's also interesting to note how the explicit violence in this film actually resembles the sex in a pornogr@phic film, with stabbing & slashing resembling penetr@t! on and spurting blood resembling ej@cul@t! on, not to mention the violent shrieking, grimacing, squirming, thr@shing, bellowing, and writhing of the victims almost resembling sensu@l ecst@sy and abandonment( though it's supposed to be terror and agony ). This is something that has always struck me and intrigued me about this film, and I've often wondered whether it was something coincidental or an express statement on the old goremeisters part?

There's also a very creepy and horrifying visual tour of the cursed cellar ( from the perspective of a character in the movie ) along which the numerous gruesome aftermaths of previous murders are gradually found ( ""DEAR GOD!!!!!!!!!!!! NOT THE CHILDREN!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" utters the explorer who's undertaking this excursion at one point ). It also features that very unique Fulci visual look and flair and, of course, some good classic gross outs ( the bleeding maggots in this one being particularly good ).

However, this movie is also, at times, CONFUSING as h#ll!!  For one thing, there are certain obscure things in the film which are never clarified yet seem to suggest that there is another party, besides the murdering monster, that is involved in the weird evil doings. For instance, during one murder scene the silhouette of an unidentified individual from outside is visible in a window which obviously isn't the monstrous killer as he emerges from the cellar. There are also these strange sinister shining eyes which appear twice and, again, clearly don't resemble those belonging to the monster that we see ( could they belong to the Devil perhaps ? ). There were also moments when it seemed to hint that Ann, the pretty but aloof and mysterious babysitter, was in kahoots with the murderous fiend, a hunch gauged from scenes of her removing a pad lock from the cellar door, without any established motive ( but, in effect, unleashing the monster and enabling the killings ) and scrubbing up the floor where a victim was previously killed. Then, however, she too got bumped off by it her self!

Adding to the overall sense of enigma are a scene of blood miraculously flowing from out of the tomb and a basement door which apparently closes shut and locks by it's self. Could it be by telekinesis? .. an invisible supernatural force? . . or perhaps some unperceived mechanical contrivance secretly installed to it?
 What is the source of the weeping childish voice which apparently serves to lure victims down into the basement? .. .  Is the monster somehow impersonating it ( which would actually be kind of funny ! ) or is the other more elusive entity behind the strange shining eyes doing it?
Just WHAT, for that matter, IS the hideous creature that lurks in the cellar and emerges to claim his victims in such gruesome and horrendous fashion? . .. Is it this Freudstein character repeatedly mentioned? .. . perhaps something he created somehow ( possibly even transformed into )? . .. or is he the spawn of a coupling between an extraterrestrial zombie and Boris Karlof's Frankenstien monster ( now simply going on his mere visual appearance, THAT would be MY personal uninformed speculation )? What is it's motive for the killings? Apart from one brief line of dialogue in which it's stated that he ""needs human victims to renew his cells"" there's no real explanation of that either. Perhaps he's in service to the thing with the shining eyes ( a kind of assassin creature )?
What of the little girl May, not to mention the equally mysterious old woman who sometimes accompanies her? It sometimes seems to be implied that they're ghosts ( by the fact that nobody but Bob can perceive them, and by the old womans victorian style of dress and appearance of her likeness on a gravestone ), . .. then, however, it seems indicated that they're neighbors ( ""What are you doing by the window?"" ""Watching the house"" ""You can't see it from there"" ).
Of course, this is part of what I like about this movie, .. . it kind of invites you to use your own imagination and draw your own conclusions a bit like one would with a subjective painting.

To wrap it up, if your the type of viewer who wants every little tidbit explained to them, demands total narrative consistency in other words, then, for God's sake, ""DON'T GO INSIDE!!!!!"" However, if you want some raw gruesomeness, eerieness and aren't afraid of applying some personal conjecture, well then, by golly, COME ON IN!!! .. and make your self right at home! Just be sure to act like a Freudstien.",1375315200,6,7889,4.78193832599119

When I buy a Bluray I expect it to be worth the price of the update. The sound on this is no better than the DVD. The picture is barely better.  It does not pop, nor did it even seem to be in full 1080p.  It's buying these kinds of Blurays that make me really question the overall worth of this format.

The picture quality was greatly improved from my Anchor Bay DVD. There is problems with DNR and noise like Zombi 2,
but not as much problems like Zombi 2. I think Zombi 2 has poorer and more use of DNR than The House by the
Cemetery.

The film grain is actually mostly noise mixed with grain. The DNR is noticable, but i have seen worse use of it as i said.
The things that are improved compared to the DVD is: black levels, blood & gore effects, colours, details and
sharpness.

Audio quality: 3.5/5

The English dub in the DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 Dolby Surround remix, is actually a bit disappointing to me. I thought
the mix would sound a bit clearer music wise and with more bass. Yes, there is some Stereo effects and such. At least it
sounds improved compared to the lossy Dolby Surround 2.0 mix on the DVD.

1409210,4,B000059PR3,"Was it wrong that I was pulling for the annoying kid to remain trapped in the basement? Basements are inherently scary places. Allow the Godfather (and, occasionally, Maestro) of Gore, Lucio Fulci, to illustrate why. THE HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY came out in 1981 but it hasn't lost its vitality or its ability to generate them shudders and spine-tingling chills. Here, Fulci's affinity for the lurid is on full exhibition. But when is it never?

THE HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY opens with a shot of Daniela Doria who you may remember as having literally puked out her guts in CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD. This time something else comes tearing out of her mouth, namely a sharp blade which had entered by way of the back of her skull. Poor Daniela Doria, the eternal victim on celluloid. The camera then shifts to the Boyle family as they relocate from New York City to a forbidding oak mansion in New England. Not that this was a deal breaker, but there's a macabre history attached to the Boyle's new home, what with its most recent resident having hung himself. And when Lucy Boyle (gorgeous Catriona MacColl) makes mention of the graveyard next door and that strange tombstone in the hallway, her husband (Paolo Malco) brushes away her concerns. ""This ain't New York,"" he scoffs. No, not even a terrifyingly tenacious bat can dissuade this guy. Maybe someone should've paid heed to the freaky little psychic girl who keeps warning people not to go into the house.

This has been repeated ad nauseam: Lucio Fulci is an exciting but flawed filmmaker. Caught between either coherence or sensationalism, he always went with the flash and the show, sacrificing script and internal logic. Once again, here's a film that finds Fulci champing at the bits, eager to get to the scary set pieces. Ghoulish innuendo and creaky noises and the establishing of plot points can only sate him for so long. Gorehounds will be well pleased with Fulci yet again. He treats us to gruesome decapitations and prolonged scenes of graphic stabby stabby. Fun fact: A blade can be cruel to human skin. Somewhere, the creators of SAW may have gone ""Hmmmm...""

The acting is negligible, although credit Catriona MacColl for playing ""Lucy Boyle"" with such nerve-jangling fragility. The English dub is mostly passable. The one exception is the dubious dubbing of the little Boyle boy which is so aggravating that even the actor who played the boy is compelled to apologize in the DVD bonus interview, assuring his fans that that wasn't his voice (""Sorry, sorry, don't hate me for that."").

THE HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY is part ghost story, part slasher flick. Fulci makes good use of the haunted house score and ominous camera compositions to build up unbearable tension. The big bad, when finally revealed, is worth the wait as he looks absolutely menacing. And, of course, he lurks in the basement. Basements (and cellars) are, to reiterate, scary places. They're meant not as much to store fine wine but rather to provide a venue to conduct terrifying, inhumane experiments. It's the sort of place in which a fella can comfortably say things like: ""He needs human victims... to renew his cells. It's how he stays alive."" The ending is typical Lucio Fulci, meaning that it is dark and bleak and unsettling. It puts the punctuation on a nifty little horror cult classic.

This is the Special Edition DVD. Note that you can set up the audio either in English or Italian (although the boy is less grating on the ears in Italian), with sub-titles available in English, French, or Spanish. The bonus features are:

1409224,2,B000059PR3,"I just don't get it.

No one who's read any of my reviews can accuse me of not appreciating low-budget, badly acted, crazy no-sense plots, poor dubbing, and awful special effects for what they are, and for making huge allowances for the time the film was created as well as its cultural differences.  And anyone who's read my reviews also knows that I revere Lucio Fulci's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zombie/dp/B0002C9DK4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zombie</a>&nbsp;as a great horror classic.  But of the two films by the same director that are part of the so-called Gates of Hell trilogy that I've seen (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/City-of-the-Living-Dead/dp/6305840024/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">City of the Living Dead</a>&nbsp;and 'The House by the Cemetery'), I just don't see their appeal.

Aside from the many red herrings and unresolved sub-plots, the story isn't too difficult, even though it ends awkwardly.  Essentially, a family moves into a house previously occupied by an academic professor doing research on suicide.  Due to some enormous strain, the professor has succumbed to the idea of suicide and taken his own life; the family that moves in is headed by the professor's partner, who is going to take over the research.  Almost immediately, the mother begins noticing strange occurances around the house, and her young boy is visited by a girl that no one else ever sees.  The menace threatening the family takes on more stridant overtones as the film progresses, and in the end, they must confront the history behind the house if they wish to escape the fates of those that came before them.

The problem I had with the film is that I just never thought it established any sense of atmospheric dread due to its many flaws.  Other reviewers have no doubt commented on the excrutiating dubbing job for the young boy, Bob, as well as the plot holes and ambigious ending.  I could easily look past these faults, but there must be something, some unusual aspect - or unusually well-done techniques - to elevate the entire production.  Throwing scenes of gore and dismemberment at the audience has its charms, I suppose, but I think that has to be at the service of the story, not the other way around.

There are many avid fans of this film - and anyone who enjoys Italian horror from the late 70's and early 80's should probably make the effort to see this one as well since it conforms to all the highs and lows of that particular genre.  I will say this for it - it isn't very predictable, but its unpredictability comes through in such convoluted ways that it's more of a distraction than a favorable quality.  If I had to rate this one against 'City of the Living Dead', I would probably give the edge to 'House by the Cemetery', though it would be close.  Both films have a moment or two that are effective - 'House', perhaps, coming closer to sustaining a level of interest due to its plot containing a bit more mystery.

But with both of these films, there should be some temporizing against too many rave reviews.  Whether or not some viewers find value here shouldn't cloud the fact that by no stretch of the imagination are these 'good' films.  They are what they are, which may also happen to be right up someone's alley, though most casual viewers are apt to dislike them - highly.  Previous experience with this type of film is the best guide, though I have to admit that, while I fully expected to find at least some positives, I was, for the most part, disappointed,",1321920000,,3586,4.994957983193277

I was skeptical about spending any money on another Blue Underground blu-ray after I got burned on their City of the Living Dead disc - For all of the rave reviews it got, I thought that was one of the worst transfers I have seen.

This disc though, is probably one of the best remasters I have seen yet.  If you have ever seen this movie on VHS or DVD, you will not believe the quality of the image on this disc - The picture is near perfect throughout the entire film!  It probably never looked this good at the theater.  I could not believe the level of detail, the color and the sharpness of the image.  The sound is excellent too.

To really push this one over the edge,  there are also a number of great extras including several cast interviews, and a talk with the effects guys.

Blue Underground has done an incredible job on this one, and restored my faith in their product - I can't wait to see what they have done with Fulci's Zombie..

1409226,5,B000059PR3,"Lucio Fulci. If you're a diehard gore/horror/grindhouse/exploitation/cult movie fan, this man's name and legacy is instantly recognizable. From such classics as Zombie, The Beyond, City of the Living Dead, The New York Ripper and this,
The House By the Cemetery, you know what you are getting:all-out gore,violently creative and graphic deaths,zombies,laughably bad dialogue, some of the worst editing ever and to-be-expected awful English dubbing(considering these are Italian films).

This one is no exception,delivering all the goods as expected. A NY moves into a New England house,with a sordid past. Not surprisingly,that past has never left. Macabre and frightening things soon happen. WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS  We get not only some really good gore,such as a bloody killing with a poker,a struggle with a bat,very bloody throat slashing/decapitation,and ultimately severed limbs and guts all about during a flashback, but this has a genuine creepy and frightening atmosphere, which you will not get most of the time in this genre. Classic horror film and haunted house flick musical score. The editing is as problematic as ever, like the rest of Fulci's catalog;pointless cuts and uneven structure. To the point of irritating. Dialogue and acting are(again like all of other Fulci's films)so bad it's hilarious, but who watches these movies for that anyway??? Only the editing is the flaw that bothers me.

Once again, Blue Underground has a done a terrific job on this BD release. Presented in it's original aspect ratio of 2.35:1,anamorphic, with an English DTS-HD 2.0 track as well as the original Italian mono, with English subtitles. Audio is clear and sharp, no problems. Picture is as vivid as you can hope for an aged,obscure title like this. Just the right amount of film grain, I did not notice any problems with DNR or compression. Colors are sharped then they've ever been. In fact, I doubt this movie has ever looked better.

Boasts a whole truckload of extras,with all but two(TV spot and poster/still gallery)being in HD. There is a deleted scene without sound, pretty much an extension of the bat-attack aftermath. The first interview with the lovely and still beautiful to-this-day Catriona MacColl and Paolo Malco is fun watch as they give their recollections and commentary. The other interviews I have yet to watch, but I'm sure they are all worth the time.

The special effects were low-budget, but influential (the knife in the back of the head would appear again in ""Pieces""). I'm sure I would have appreciated the acting a lot more if there were a version available in the original language. I rather enjoyed the children: the hapless Bob and the unfortunate, but helpful, Mae. I would agree that whoever provided the voice-over dub for Bob did not do him justice. Still, this was a creepy movie. Over the past two months I've seen it about 5 times and developed a deeper appreciation for it and Fulci's work in general. If you think that horror began with the ""Saw"" series, then this one isn't for you. But if you can get past low-budget special effects and marginal dubbing and acting, then you'll enjoy this.

But what did I see included with these gems? House By The Cemetery. So, feeling nostalgic for bad taste, I popped some popcorn, grabbed me a hard lemonade and sat down to give this Lucio Fulci offering a second look. Well, believe or not, I actually enjoyed it, with some minor complaints which, by the way, reminded me why I didn't care for it the first time around. First I'll talk about the negatives, not enough details about Freudstein's motive, he's a paper thin type killer with not a whole lot of depth. The same I would say about the other characters as well, who did not put up much of a fight against a slow moving, maggot filled corpse. The kid (Bob) voice dubbing is downright annoying, I almost put the volume on mute whenever he was going to talk. (I'd rather listen to a whining 2 year old with nasal issues than hear ""Bob"" again!) Positives: awesome soundtrack, good cinematography, a few well pace suspensful scenes creating the right atmosphere for an otherwise creepy horror film. Oh, did I mention the gory murder scenes? Makes Friday The 13th look like Romper Room! Hmm, maybe it was it the six pack and a half of hard lemonade that made this film more bearable a second time around. Ah, nonethless, I did like House By The Cemetery and would probably pick up a copy of the Anchor Bay release as an addition to my growing collection of Italian horror films.

Fulci is known is being this great director of horror movies, but none of his movies are any good.  I have no idea why people think they are, but they just aren't.  He's one of the worst directors I've ever seen try to pace a movie or logically roll through a plot.  In Fulci movies, things happen for no reason, and characters die for no reason.  Everyone in all of his films are so incredibly disposable you don't even care when they die.  This entire movie is totally unwatchable until the final scene in the cellar, which is why the movie is famous at all.  You are introduced to a very cool looking antagonist, but his purpose is entirely unclear.

Overall, I have no idea why anything happened in this movie.  I don't know why the characters don't fight the antagonist, I don't know why the antagonist is an antagonist, and I'm totally lost by the very last scene where the boy is rescued.  This whole damn movie made no sense. Don't watch it, it isn't even worth it for the gore, and its not scary.",1285545600,4,1030,4.345549738219895

Undeveloped/unexplained plot points abound, yet it is still pretty decent for Italian horror, despite the awful voices chosen for the dubbing of certain characters. In the end, the viewer will likely find this Fulci classic to be a fun bit of moody ghost story/horror entertainment, though with quite a few questions left unanswered or ideas left open to interpretation. Get set for some over-the-top gore moments and a few goofy ones too, but I've seen much worse on both counts. Worth picking up if you are into Fulci, mystery/ghost stories, or Italian horror in general.

The Blue Underground DVD has some nice extras with this widescreen presentation. The audio doesn't sound quite perfect though.

Fulci had a sort of renaissance in the 1990's, and I decided to see what all the fuss was about.  Directors like Quentin Tarantino (who re-released The Beyond to theaters) and Eli Roth have raved about his work.  So I wanted to see the man's work.  I watched a ton of his work, and the only film I really liked was Zombie.  Zombie is a good film, but it pales in comparison to great horror filmmakers' best films, like Romero's vastly superior zombie films, and Dario Argento's masterful period from 1975-1987.  This was the last film of his I saw, and I am angry that I wasted so much time going through this man's catalog.

House by the Cemetery is the usual Fulci mishmash.  There's a creepy ending and some good atmosphere, but this film has all the characteristics from the Fulci [...] moviemaking school...bad scenes, bad continuity, bad acting, miserable scripting, complete incoherence, bad dubbing, etc., etc..  Even the gore here isn't as visceral as it is in other Fulci works, like City of the Living Dead and The Beyond.  You do remember the gore in some Fulci films, but it's damn near impossible to wade through the rest of the garbage to get to it.  I am not a gorehound, so I prefer for an entire film to be good, as opposed to having a few decent gore scenes and having to wade through the rest of a crapy film until I get there, which is exactly what you have to do with Fulci's work.  Some say that Dario Argento's work, a far superior filmmaker, doesn't make sense either.  Argento's films are purposely ambiguous, like nightmares, and this was used to the greatest effect in Suspiria (one of the few films that really scares me) and Inferno (his most underrated).  Just because a film is confusing doesn't mean it's art.

So if anyone is thinking of diving into Fulci's catalog, stop right now.  Unless you're a gorehound needing a fix, stay away.  Fulci's films are a waste of time (except for Zombie).",1224460800,5,2006,4.497237569060774

Long ago, a mad scientist named Dr. Freudstein conducted horrific experiments on people as he murdered them in the basement and used them, now a curse brings him back to life as a ravenous murderous zombie that kills as he seeks new blood and more people to kill and experiment on with ghostly events happening.

Ghastly, unique and stylish supernatural zombie/haunted house thriller from Lucio Fulci is one of his best movies yet. Sure it lacks coherence but this movie delivers dark atmosphere, great scares, gory sequences like the skull stabbing and Bat mutilation sequences, and a chilling music score. I love how this movie combines both the zombie and haunted house movie genres especially influence by HP Lovecraft into one movie thanks to the magic of Fulci whom also makes a cameo in this motion picture, this is one of my all time favorite scary movies ever and highly recommended for fans of the genres but not for the squeamish.

The movie starts right out with a great splatter of the red stuff and we are off and runnin'! The first thing you will notice about this movie is the haunting score. It's fantastic, one of the best elements of the film. The second thing you will notice is the lousy vocal dub for ""Bob""??? Not sure who or what is providing that voice....but it is pretty jarring when first heard to say the least. Finally you will notice that ""House"" actually serves up more suspense than oozing red stuff as it plays out. There are some pretty chilling scenes sprinkled throughout the film, and the final 15 minutes is fantastic!

This is one of the more boring Italian horror films I have in my collection. The gore was laughable and not even in a goofy/good kind of way, just atrociously stupid. The young boy, I hope, was banned from the screen actor's guild, and the voice actor who dubbed his parts should have been exiled from all of civilization. Wow. If you'd like to watch a series of unrelated random events with a bit of unexplainable gore, 1 hour of nothing, and a pointless ending with one of the more ham-handed performances by an evil, undead villain, by all means knock yourselves out. The only good thing I will say about this film is that the atmosphere is very Italian gothic, and was effective (reason why I give it 2 stars). Anyway, Fulci should have stuck with his mystery movies and neanderthal gory themes, which he's very good at in moderation. The minute he tried to rip off aspects of the Shining and the Changeling, he lost the tiny bit credibility he may have still had. Avoid this gutter snipe, and move on to his better films such as those I mentioned above.",1193702400,2,1220,4.5

1409255,3,B000059PR3,"This is the third in a loose trilogy of films by Italian master of the macabre Lucio Fulci set in New England that evoke the uncanny and cosmic terrors of H.P. Lovecraft. The other two films ""City of the Living Dead"" and ""The Beyond"" are quite a bit better than ""House by the Cemetery"", but that doesn't mean this film is totally without merit. At times Fulci succeeds very well in creating an atmosphere of dread and fear, and the film is not without some subtle moments of terror, due mainly to an eerie soundtrack and a couple of creepy kids. But fans of Fulci and Italian horror cinema in general are not interested in the type of subtle scares one might find in English ghost stories; instead his films are marked by unusual levels of graphic violence. Although this film is not without its moments (throats ripped out, maggot ridden bodies and decapitation), the violence seems quite muted compared to other Fulci films. Fulci is perhaps aiming too strongly for the atmosphere of Lovecraft, and subsequently forgets to invest in his film the graphic and absurdly violent scenes which have afforded his work a cult following. The film as is usually the case with Fulci makes little sense and is full of continuity errors, its difficult to know whether this is down to bad editing, or an intentional effort to create an uncanny world in which time and space are confused, personally I prefer the latter possibility. There has always been something dream like and hallucinatory about Italian horror cinema and this film doesn't disappoint on that level. By combing Freud and Frankenstein in the name of the films ostensible monster/zombie, the rotting cadaver of the once great scientist Dr. Freudstein provides an interesting connection between psychoanalysis and the scientist playing god. In light of Fulci's career post ""House by the Cemetery"", this has to be considered one of his last decent efforts.

This DVD re-issue is by Blue Underground, who seem to have acquired some of the titles of Anchor Bay's back catalogue for re-issue. My only main grumble is with the audio, which is particularly tinny, other than that this is a good reasonably priced package.",1179446400,5,2169,4.878048780487805
1409256,4,B000059PR3,"The House by the Cemetery was released during the height of Lucio Fulci's career. From between 1979-1983 is the era Fulci will forever be known for. While he had some solid movies prior to that it's really the 79-83 era is what he will be remembered for. The House by the Cemetery might be one of the weaker ones from that era, but yet there is something strangely compelling about this movie. Maybe it's the fact the movie is so incoherent at times and that it's sort of laughable. Or maybe it's the unintentional comedy like the bat attack scene.

Lucio Fulci in my opinion was a director who was able to build some good suspense and tension due to his visual style. Even in some of his lesser movies he was able to make something out of nothing even if he was unable to maintain it. In The House by the Cemetery some of that can be found. But the biggest downfall of the movie is the really poor dubbing for Giovanni Frezza who will forever be known to hardcore horror fans as Bob. Apparently he was dubbed by a woman, but regardless the dubbing was just bad. Any scene he was in was comedy gold. This, in a way adds to the movie, but also takes away from scenes that might have played out better with some better dubbing.

Lucio Fulci was a filmmaker who can be really hit or miss and sometimes even in the same movie. The House by the Cemetery is one of those movies. The opening scene was quite effective; the set up was great and it had a creepy feel to it. The pacing here is slow; after the opening kill scene we don't get another for a good 40-min. The movie is filled with a lot of talk and a lot of scenes that never really go anywhere despite a build up with the characters and some interesting ideas.

Lucio Fulci seems to be building up something with some of the characters, but yet it never comes to be. The babysitter Anne seems to have some kind of big revelation coming, but it never happens. Any scene she is in has this weirdness to it, but yet nothing comes to be. What makes this movie so inserting is it's sort of a zombie movie due to the Dr. Freudstein character, but it's also sort of a slasher movie and than throw in some supernatural haunting. The House by the Cemetery had an interesting idea, but sadly the movie is so incoherent with nothing really explained everything is sort of lost.

The House by the Cemetery easily rates as one of Fulci's most incoherent movies; nothing really makes any sense at all nothing is really explained. Bottom line is what little plot we get is very messy. The screenplay was written by Giorgio Mariuzzo, Lucio Fulci and Dardano Sacchetti. If the other 2 writers sound familiar they should. Both have worked with Lucio Fulci several times with Sacchetti being the man responsible for several of Fulci's more popular titles.

While Fulci manages to build some suspense due to the messy plot and poor dubbing it's hard to sustain it and the scenes start to become funny for the wrong reasons. There was some decent suspense and in my opinion the final act is actually quite solid. Like I said Lucio Fulci was the type of director who could be very hit or miss and sometimes even in the same movie. Gore-hounds though fear not, when there is a gore scene Fulci doesn't hold back at all. While some dub this his goriest I have to disagree. The gore is excellent done by the always reliable and much underrated Giannetto De Rossi. Not Fulci's goriest, but when there is gore it will please the fans.

Most of the cast are Fulci regulars; many of them have done several movies with Fulci with Katherine MacColl probably being the most well known. Despite all the flaws of The House by the Cemetery I couldn't help, but really enjoy the movie. As I stated earlier sure the movie is incoherent nothing makes sense. Some of the characters seem to have some kind of revelation ready to come out and it never does. But I was really enjoying this movie. Maybe it was the flaws that make this movie so much fun?

The look of the movie was excellent; like I said before Fulci had a great visual style and along with cinematographer Sergio Salvati who worked with Lucio Fulci quite a few times really create a great look for the movie. There are a lot of scenes that have a great creepy feel and the overall tone of the movie is well done. The House by the Cemetery featured a lot of people from past Lucio Fulci movies, which helps the movie, but one would expect a bit more seeing as these people done some great work with Fulci.

In many ways this is one of Lucio Fulci's weaker efforts from this era and it's also one of his strongest at the same time. The House by the Cemetery has a great and creepy feel, but the plot is incoherent and revelations that seem to be waiting to come out never do. And the ending is also a bit complicated. But despite all this I highly enjoyed this movie. Fulci purists will probably get enjoyment out of this so if you like his work I would say this movie is worth seeking out. For those who don't like Fulci's work this probably won't be the movie to change your opinion of him.

My review for House by the Cemetery may not sound positive at all, but I did enjoy the movie a lot more than maybe I should have. Despite all the flaws there is just something really creepy about House by the Cemetery. As stated before in many ways this is one of Fulci's weaker and stronger efforts.",1179014400,,5371,4.352295409181637

1409260,3,B000059PR3,"The House by the Cemetery is an Italian horror movie that has all the things you'd expect in a bad movie:  cheesy special effects, bad acting and a plot that is only vaguely comprehensible.  It's the sort of movie you'd expect to see on Mystery Science Theater 3000 if not for the excessive violence.  There's all sorts of reasons to hate this movie, which makes it all the more surprising that I like it:  I suppose it fits into the ""so-bad-it's-good"" category.

The movie begins with a brief prologue involving the gruesome murder of a couple lovers in an abandoned house.  Then the story kicks in, with a family moving temporarily into the same house;  the mother has some sort of minor psychological problem, the father is obsessed with a research project and the son is crippled by an inability to act.  Oh yes, and the house is by a cemetery.  You'd think that the cemetery might explain the evil events, but actually it has almost nothing to do with the story.

It's hard to explain the plot, which seems made up as it goes along.  Plot lines go nowhere...there are hints that the father has been in town before, but nothing comes of it.  The babysitter seems to be somehow involved with the killings, at least until she wanders into the cellar, an underground room that the family seems to like to leave the door open to, despite the killer bats that live inside.  There is something else living in the cellar too, one of those slow-moving monsters that no one seems able to outrun.  And then there is the ending, one of those conclusions that make you just go ""huh?""

It's hard for me to figure out the appeal of this movie, but there is something likeable about this effort, enough to merit three stars, even though, based on its flaws, it should be less.  It is pretty gory, however (even if the effects aren't very realistic), but if you like cheesy horror, this may be worth watching.",1148083200,6,1897,4.535294117647059

1409262,4,B000059PR3,"I remember watching ""House by the Cemetery"" about 10 or 12 years ago and remember always considering it the best work of Lucio Fulci. A couple of days back I watched it again and although it seemed to be rather stupid and simple I still think it's Fulci's best. Sure it's freaky sometimes: where have you seen mansions standing in the middle of a cemetery? When the housekeeper rubs away a giant blood stain on the floor, woman who lives in the house doesn't come up with idea to ask where this stain came from(!). The couple's kid acts strange and totally unbelievable. There's a pile of cadavers kept in the basement and no one notices it for a long time... Anyway there are plenty inadequacies whatsoever in the movie. But still it looks good. Maybe because these misdoings are so downright and bold. If we take all the mishaps for granted (and it's the way most of Italian horror should be seen) ""House by the Cemetery"" looks fine and even better than all flicks of this kind - I mean haunted house flicks. But here we get clear explanation in the end again unlike in many other movies. Besides ""House"" can boast of having excellent score hence perfect horror atmosphere.
Shot right after ""The Beyond"" and a year before ""New York Ripper"", ""House by the Cemetery"" to my opinion stays one of the best Lucio Fulci's works. I guess you'll hate it if you are not a horror fan, but if you are you must have this cult classic in your collection.",1144540800,,1442,4.486692015209125
1409263,2,B000059PR3,"As a fan of zombie movies and as someone who enjoyed City of the Living Dead and Zombie, I was very disappointed with House by the Cemetery. Fulci manages to create a good mystery in the first two-thirds of the movie, only to squander it on some poorly executed scare scenes.

House By the Cemetery is about an researcher (whose work is never specified) who moves his wife and his kid into a house in Massachussets in order to finish out the work of a colleague who killed himself and his mistress. The titular house is the only place they can really find for the moment, so Dr. Boyle, his wife Lucy and their son Bob move in despite a lot of bad signs, like the boarded-up door to the cellar and a tombstone for a Dr. Jacob Tess Freudstein in the front hall. Bob has little red-headed girl for a friend who keeps warning him about how bad the house is (though no one else sees her). Furthermore, people keep claiming Dr. Boyle has been in town before with a non-existent daughter (which he denies, not totally convincingly). He also seems to have some secret relationship with the babysitter, Anne, who starts unboarding the cellar door in the middle of the night. And Lucy seems to either be recovering from or suffering from serious psychological issues.

Got that? Good, because half of that stuff never gets explained. The only things that get worked out are the little red-headed girl's identity and the identity of the killer (neither of which are that hard to figure out). There are some nice visual moments in the earlier parts of the film (the fact that the killer has one normal hand and one rotting hand, the photograph that changes with each viewing, a mannequin that gets beheaded and starts bleeding) but Fulci's ability to handle the gore moments disappoints. He lingers too long over some deaths, makes the killer so ridiculously slow that a snail could outrun him and bits like the babysitter's head falling down the stairs come off as funny rather than scary. Compared to the injury to the eye scene in Zombie or Christopher George chopping through the coffin in CotLD, Dr. Boyle's chopping through the door around his son's head feels like self-parody.

Fulci's other films have incoherent plots , but rarely in a way that seems to work against the plot (the dream-like nature of City of the Living Dead seems appropriate given the prophetic dream the heroine gets and the mystical nature of the threat) and the execution of the setpieces is usually fantastic. House by the Cemetery has neither thing working in its favor. It's not Hell of the Living Dead-level bad, but the fact that it has some genuinely good acting (especially Paolo Malco, who plays Dr. Boyle) and an interesting set-up almost make the flaws worse.

Also, this version has a ""never before seen deleted scene"", but it has no sound and is just an extended reaction shot after the bat attack.",1141257600,3,2880,4.663385826771654

1409265,4,B000059PR3,"House By The Cemetery is another fine film that is often missed among horror lovers. While it's not a masterpiece, it is a very satisfying killer flick.

Trimming down the movie's plot to it's essentials, HBTC presents the story of the horrifying legend of a man, Dr. Freudstein, who has been living in the basement of a creepy house for many years -- surviving off of the cells of living humans he captures. The Boyle family, who've just moved into the house, are the most recent unlucky bunch to meet the zombie Doctor and face his diabolical intentions. Will they escape? Or will they just become a few more bodies in Freudstein's mass grave of a laboratory?

Fulci attempts to throw in a little ""twist"" for the ending, and I suppose he succeeds, even though I, for one, was a little confused by the ending. It seems interesting, but the meaning of it is not too clear. Nonetheless, you can be assured that even if you miss any underlying cleverness, you should still be able to enjoy this good old-fashioned piece of horror.

1409266,4,B000059PR3,"I have long been a Fulci fanatic and this film, ""House By The Cemetery,"" delivers the goods in spades.

The story is simple, if not altogether derivative. A young family moves from their cramped New York apartment into a spacious New England mansion. What sets this place apart from their previous abode, however, is the presence of the home's original owner, the detestable Dr. Freudstein. It would seem that he has been hiding in the home's shuttered basement for the last 100 years, picking off stray dwellers of the house and using their fluids and various other organs to sustain his own decomposing body. Sound far-fetched? Well, it should. But don't let that deter you. This is not ""Rebecca From Sunnybrook Farm"" or ""Meet John Doe"" we're talking about. It's a horror film with all the trademark gore and over-the-top violence we've come to expect from Lucio Fulci. Not high art by any stretch, but certainly never boring either.

1409269,3,B000059PR3,"Lucio Fulci  is one oddly inconsistent filmmaker.  I've only seen 4 of his films, though arguably his 4 most famous ones, which were made pretty much one after another.  Yet they vary wildly in quality on extremely basic levels.  While 'Zombie' is not the height of cinematic sophistication, it is essentially competent.  It's not scary by any stretch of the imagination, but I don't really take it as a joke.  Then with 'City of the Living Dead' Fulci apparently forgot everything he knew, and made a film that isn't half as professional as was 'Zombie'.(Though it still was an entertaining film, certainly)  Then he makes 'The Beyond', which is not w/o a few rough edges and some hokiness at times, but still a genuinely stylish and atmospheric film most of the time.  And then we get 'The House by the Cemetery' and are back in 'City of the Living Dead' territory, competency wise.  As with that film, 'House...' is entertaining, and worth a look for people who enjoy cheap horror films.  But it ain't good, by any stretch of the imagination.

This film contains an odd mishmash of genres mixing haunted house with slasher with a dash of zombie film.  I won't bother with the plot too much- a family moves into the house which has a murderous zombie-dude, Dr. Freudstein, in the cellar, who has to kill in order to live on and on.(Why or how this is is never addressed. Not that it matters.)  Also, the kid in the family, Bob, has telepathic abilities, and has a little girl friend who no one else can see.  That's about it. They sit around, and occasionally Freudstein tries to stab them up, and often succeeds.  I don't mind the sitting around- I thought that the atmosphere and tone of 'The Beyond' was the better part of the film.  However, the setting isn't all that interesting visually, and the score is hokey and overwrought, particularly when compared Frizzi's or Goblin's better work.  So, the film tends to come out as more uneventful than atmospheric.

(However, I've only seen a crappy cheapass version, rather than the Anchor Bay one.  Thus, the print and transfer were terrible, and I presume it would be at least somewhat more interesting visually with a decent print.  Still, I doubt if it would be anywhere near being a genuinely good horror film.)

The film is less gory than the other films I've seen from him, but it's still got a fair amount.  Freudstein mostly likes to work the throat, to quite gruesome effect.  Their are some conceptually cool effects that don't really pan out in execution.  Towards the beginning of the film, Freudstein stabs someone through the back of the head, with such force that the blade comes out her mouth.  Cool idea, lame execution.  Later, Freudstein is cut, and starts to bleed maggots.  Once again, the effect ain't ideal, but the concept is neat enough that it doesn't matter too much. Finally, while Freudstein's mannerisms are quite effective, his makeup pretty  much sucks.

Still, the film does have a few effectively atmospheric moments, as did 'City...'  The best part would be when the father of the family finds a tape that the previous tenant recorded. As he plays it the camera ominously pans about the house, moving into the cellar which is then filled with creepy mutilated corpses.(Which mysteriously appear again later)  The rather inexplicable ending is pretty cool too, though I won't go into specifics.

And yeah, Bob is plenty obnoxious, but I've seen other kids in movies that are equally obnoxious.  And yeah, the bat attack is extremely weak, but the bat attack in 'Suspiria' was lame too, as was the Bug attack scene in 'Phantasm' but I almost never hear anyone complain about those scenes.  One lame horror scene doesn't kill a movie.  There's also some hilarious Foley work, particularly when a head is rolling down a staircase.  Sounds like a damn bowling ball. Still, this movie is entertaining, and I just like watching Fulci's work.  I actually enjoy  his leisurely pacing, even when there isn't all that much atmosphere, and his distinctive visual tics.  (Random zooms and close-ups, Focusing near then far in the same shot and vice versa, eye shots etc.)  So, it gets my recommendation, if not exactly the heartiest one ever.",1108512000,8,4218,4.78808864265928

There was no story line, just a poorly conceived concept the dubbing or voice sinc was atrocious. The actors especially the young boy was extremely annoying and the gore that normally would make a film like this, remotely watch able was non-existent.

Characters just turned up with no explanation, people disappeared and no one seemed bothered, blood seem to just vanish from the floor, need I go on.....

1409276,4,B000059PR3,"No figure in the horror film genre is as divisive as Lucio Fulci. After watching one or two of his films, viewers tend to move into one of two camps. One side hails Fulci as a master of terror, a man who upped the gore quotient in his films while creating wonderfully atmospheric pictures. For these people, Fulci is right up there with the likes of Dario Argento as one of the best filmmakers ever to emerge from Italy. The other camp sneers at these claims, pointing to the plodding pace of his films, the use of extreme gore to camouflage plot holes, and the director's inability to draw good performances out of his cast as evidence of mediocrity. Initially, I enjoyed Fulci's films, specifically ""Zombie,"" ""City of the Living Dead,"" and ""The New York Ripper"" because I did not know any better. When I came on the scene, you went to Fulci to feed your craving for gore. What a difference a few years exploring the genre makes! While I will not go so far as to remove Lucio from my play list altogether, I have seen enough of his films to realize he is not a cinematic genius. He is at best a competent director, at worst an abysmal one, and there are plenty of examples of bad filmmaking in this director's filmography. ""Zombie"" is without a doubt his best film, but ""The House By The Cemetery"" runs a close second along with ""The Beyond"" and ""The Gates of Hell.""

 Good old Lucio amazingly foregoes his usual heavy gore quotient with ""House,"" instead attempting to ramp up the atmospheric qualities of the film. It's the story of a house by a cemetery (!) once lived in by Dr. Freudstein, a physician who quickly earned an unsavory reputation amongst the local denizens for unspecified atrocities committed in his basement. These events occurred way back in early twentieth century, but his reputation lives on in the minds of the poor dupes who rent the house. The latest victims are the Boyle family, mother Lucy (Catriona MacColl), father Norman (Paolo Malco), and son Bob (Giovanni Frezza). The trio moves into Freudstein's old abode when Norman, a professor at a New York City university, decides to finish up a deceased colleague's research. Apparently, Dr. Peterson couldn't hack it up in Freudstein's house so it is up to Norm to finish the assignment. A few problems present a host of difficulties for the young professor. First, wife Lucy seems to have suffered a nervous breakdown at one point in her life, and continues to have issues requiring periodic hysterical fits followed by heavy doses of medication. Second, son Bob claims that he is seeing and conversing with a young, redheaded girl by the name of Mae (Silvia Collatina), a girl who warns the young boy not to go into the house. Aaah, the life of an academic, eh?

 What happens once the young family moves in? Oh, the usual Fulci stuff. It turns out Freudstein's experiments were quite ghastly, that the good doctor didn't actually pass away but instead learned a few secrets that allowed him to keep up the appearance of the house. To do so, Freudstein must routinely butcher anyone who ventures across the doorstep. The key to the whole film rests on a locked door leading into the cellar. The Boyle family continually experience problems with this portal and the basement it leads to. When Norman finally opens the door and wanders inside, a cheesy looking bat that looks like it is on loan from an Ed Wood, Jr. production attacks the professor with quite bloody results. The basement will continue to dominate center stage for most of the film. In the meantime, Norm turns up a bunch of scary information at the library about Freudstein, including a taped statement from the late Peterson about the supernatural activities going on in the house. Little Mae keeps turning up to make cryptic statements about the abode, a creepy babysitter named Anne (Ania Pieroni) appears to make things interesting, and the real estate agent who rented the house to the Boyles seems to know more than she's letting on.

 That ought to be enough to give you an idea about the film. The good points of the film outweigh the negatives. While you get less gore than in ""Zombie"" or ""The Gates of Hell,"" you still bear witness to a gory prodding with a poker, a couple of slashed throats, an impaling, and a few other saucy surprises. Fulci even delivers a few chills. For example, there's a great scene at the beginning of the film where Bob sees Mae in a picture of the house hanging on the wall of his parents' apartment. The eventual appearance of Freudstein is unsettling and graphic. Unfortunately, we also get Fulci's trademark plot threads that go nowhere and a confusing conclusion. Worse, there's Bob. Imagine, if you will, a little kid that looks a lot like Klaus Kinski must have appeared as a child but with a dub job so bad that it peels paint off walls. Who in the heck did the voiceover for this kid? Bob is so annoying you'll miss out on significant portions of the movie while recovering from his dialogue.

 The Anchor Bay treatment of Fulci's classic looks superb. The transfer is amazingly clear and the score sounds great. Extras include two trailers for the film (loved the voiceover of the guy who did those trailers!), a stills gallery, and biographies for Fulci and screenwriter Dardano Sacchetti. You don't get as many extras here as you do with ""The Beyond"" or ""Zombie"" discs, 'tis true, but I didn't miss them. Give ""The House By The Cemetery"" a shot if you're just getting into Fulci; you'll definitely want to check out his better known stuff first, but skipping this one would be tragic.",1091491200,4,5580,4.675152749490835
1409277,4,B000059PR3,"This was the first Lucio Fulci film I've had the pleasure of viewing! I look forward to seeing his other works! The House by the Cemetery hits on all points of a horror movie! It's creepy, eerie and has some awesome killing scenes and GORE!! They don't call Lucio ""The godfather of gore"" for nothing! The acting? Well, sub-par at best. Plot? Interesting, but not deep. The dubbing well it's pretty bad but who cares it's a great horror film.
The Boyle family move from their cramped New York apartment  into an old mansion near Boston so that the father can do some needed research. The new tenants, unbeknownst to them, have a god awful secret living in their basement. A certain Dr. Freudstein has been housed below since 1879 and has kept himself alive by murdering inhabitants of the mansion and using their cells to keep his body going. Gore, horror, and great special effects makes a visit to the House by the Cemetery a killer stay! A knife through the skull, nice throat ripping and slashing, decapatation, and some maggot spewing make for a ""pleasurable"" movie for the avid horror fan.
We all know horror movies aren't supposed to be deep with Academy Award winning acting. If we wanted that we wouldn't be watching this type of film. I can't compare this film to Fulci's other works because I haven't seen any others, but to me this was impressive and one I would recommend to fans of the genre!!",1089676800,2,1406,4.601593625498008

True, the dubbing does suck and the acting is questionable, but the last 15 minutes of this movie almost make up for it. Dr. Freudstein is truly one of the most twisted and interesting villians I've yet seen in a horror movie and its easy to see Rob Zombie's inspiration for his Dr. Death character in House of 1000 Corpses. Not to mention, there's a few scenes near the end that push the gore envelope to the max! Love the maggot-stew gushing out of Freudsteins wounds... Truly twisted!! They don't make gore effects like this anymore, i hate CGI gore!!",1088294400,2,683,4.428571428571429
1409279,4,B000059PR3,"The great thing about Lucio Fulci movies on DVD is that you can skip right to the gore without the annoying need to fast forward or rewind those worn out ol' vhs tapes found at your local video store. I assume that if you're searching this movie on amazon, you know about Fulci or you've heard about him from one of your horror-movie buddies and you want to know what all the fuss is about.
Let me fill you in. House by the Cemetary is not Fulci's goriest movie, but it is his most atmospherically directed. Don't get me wrong, there is some good gore, but if you haven't ever seen a Fulci movie before and want to know what all the goreheads are raving about, start with Zombie, The Beyond, or even City of the Living Dead.  House by the Cemetary is a good second or third Fulci movie to check out if you dig him.
The plot (as if you care) is this: a family moves into a house by a cemetary (who'd a thunk it!) though the cemetary really never comes into play in the movie. Go figure. The son of the family keeps seeing a red-haired little girl who warns him of imminent danger. The house is full of giant bats and weird noises, and a killer lurks in the basement. Blah. Blah. Blah.
Here's the rundown on the gore (yep, I knew this was what you were really interested in): first scene of the movie, a young woman is stabbed in the head. Later on, another woman is impaled by some kind of metal pole. Cue the capitation. A throat gets ripped out. A bat gets knived in gooey fashion. This, more or less, is the extent of it. For a Fulci film, this is pretty conservative.
Despite his penchant for gore, Fulci has a nice creepy vibe flowing through HBTC, starting early on with the image of the girl standing by a window in an old picture. The woods and tombstones around the house add a nice air of eerie atmosphere. The performances are ok, but the dubbing for the blonde kid is ridiculously annoying.
Some of you may wonder what the deal is with Fulci. For instance, ine one scene Fulci implies that something is going on between the father of the family and the new nanny by cutting between their two eyes peering at one another; however, nothing SEEMS to be going on between them. These sort of weird ""what's this all about"" camera tricks and moments pop up through the film, but remember this is a Fulci flick. Weirdness is the order of the day, and forget about it.
Despite himself, Fulci has a nice nightmarish quality to his work that, no matter how silly it seems, can seep into your dreams.",1086825600,,2499,4.305732484076433
1409280,3,B000059PR3,"House by the cemetery is not a solid horror film by all means, and really will end up only on the shelves of Fulci or Italian Exploitation Devotees (most likely one and the same) such as myself. The casual horror-goer has much to be put off by, which I will get into in a moment.
First, I feel I should summarize a bit on the best period of Fucli's filmmaking, which spanned Zombi 2 to House by the Cemetery. Zombi 2 starts the 'series' off with a bang, delivering shocks and style and the best zombies ever to appear on celluloid (fx maestro Giannetto Di Rossi never even topped himself). The film was a more traditional zombie film in the sense that it took place in the Carribean and keeps with the feel, if not the facts, of vodun zombies. The second film, which is the first of his 'zombie trilogy', was City of the Living Dead. Here, Fulci shifts gears from the table he set in Zombi 2 and starts a series that is more united and share several character traits. The Gates of Hell have opened and the dead have begun to walk the earth. The story is scattered, as Fulci is just beginning to master the themes he would use so well in the Beyond, a dream-like masterpiece. Another Gate opens, and strange occurances, culminating with a zombie invasion, centre around an old hotel which was the site of an execution of a warlock many years earlier. Fulci's last Date with the Dead in the series was House by the Cemetery.
The film starts off with a rousing opening sequence, preparing the viewer for an onslaught that never arrives until almost 85 minutes later. While most of the previous films mentioned have little narrative structure and make barely an ounce of sense, there is even less to be found here. Yet before, where Fulci made up for this with stylish set pieces and mayhem, outside of the opening and the finale, there is little to keep your attention. The plot is nonexistent, as are the characters, and many 'surreal' sequences are plain absurd. The entire middle of the movie is non-stop talking head, during which nothing gets explained anyway, with only a few moments of the good stuff.
The casual horror fan (ie, the one that thought House of 1000 Corpses was the be all end all) will be chased away by the atrocious dubbing, though common with our beloved Italian Flicks, seems particularly bad here, most likely due to the boy cast as Bob, who seems as out of place as the man-child in Burial Ground. He appears almost too foreign...I can't quite place it. Italian Splatter fans will find the redeeming values, and Fulci fans will enjoy it as the last film in a great run.
In short, first-time Fulci viewers are safer to start with Zombi 2 and then peek at the Beyond. This and City of the Living Dead are most likely for the veterans to appreciate.",1074470400,,2771,4.5
1409281,1,B000059PR3,"This is somewhere between ultra-bad and barely passable.
Lucio Fulci is known as a ""hit or miss"" director. Out of his fifty plus works some are great, others are outstanding, some are mediocre and the remaining, pure rubbish. Unfortunately this is one of Fulci's pure rubbish ones that is further spoiled immensely by Anchor Bay Entertainment's display cover of the secret monster than this film builds up too. Normally Anchor Bay is quite good and their DVD sets are super but this one has pretty much broken the golden rule of not giving certain things away on the sleeve - Bah!
Anyway the film itself is pure rubbish from start to finish and is about a family that move into a haunted house with a sinister presence at work, killing people off. The family try to figure out what is going on and their kid is having visions of a ghost that is trying to warn them of some danger. There is also a subplot involving a strange doctor that once lived in the house and who conducted experiments into prolonging life. Sounds good, but the execution is poor, slow and never really satisfying except for the ending which is not all that bad and helps earn it that one star.
In short, Fulci churned this one out quickly and for the money. He made several other films that same year. If Fulci had given this film a bit more of his precious time and attention we would have had an ace picture on our hands - a five star horror, but It feels rushed and contrived and much of the story is slow with lots of meaningless time filler stuff. In fact, and I hate to say it!, this horror film is one that deserves a remake... but no one can be blamed for that except Fulci who could have done it so much better instead of cashing in on the moment.",1072828800,2,1729,4.356037151702786

1409283,3,B000059PR3,"House by the Cemetery (Lucio Fulci, 1981)
One wonders, idly, why it is that Fulci felt the need to make (essentially) the same movie twice in one year. While House by the Cemetery is set in Boston, the family configuration is different, and the long-leggetie beastie is a different sort of thing, House by the Cemetery might as well have been outtakes from the superior The Beyond. Just to add to the similarity, Fulci cast Catriona MacColl as the female lead in both.
Just in case you've never seen The Beyond, the story: family (in this case, family has kid) moves into eerie house. Strange things start happening, most of which involve a lot of blood. Family members uncover long-buried secret that is the key to understanding the nastiness, but by that time, it's pretty much too late for the knowledge to actually help anyone, and we end up with a long, bloody climax.
I can't quite put my finger on why, of the two films, The Beyond seems like the superior product. The acting quality is about equal, the set decoration is similar, the plot makes all the appropriate twists and turns (and some of them are unpredictable), the cinematography is appropriately dark and brooding where it needs to be without going over the line into David Fincher-like claustrophobia. I guess it's because House by the Cemetery doesn't have the gratuitous spider scene The Beyond has (and let's not forget Maria Marsala's memorable turn in The Beyond, either, a parallel of which House by the Cemetery lacks).
It's good bloody Fulci fun, and a fine way to kill (with a large axe, of course) an hour and a half. But The Beyond edges it on the rewatchability factor. ***",1070236800,,1654,4.706896551724138
1409284,3,B000059PR3,"Typical gory Fulci fare about a young family who settles into a creepy, run down house that comes complete with cobwebs, killer bats and a beast in the cellar. The lovely Catriona MacColl returns and gives (as usual) a very good performance. The child actor in the film is adorable but whatever cuteness he possesses goes right out the window because he becomes increasingly irritating as the film moves along thanks largely to the horrible dubbing. It sounds like adults were used to dub the children's voices and the end result is extremely annoying.

Before I mention the gore/violence, I do want to point out that the film's score, at times, is beautiful. Many scenes in the film are enhanced by the melodic yet eerie score such as the scene in the beginning, after the opening gore sequence, when a seemingly lost child looks out from her house's front window and her image is frozen on screen as the main child actor contemplates her frozen image in an old photograph. The brief scene is rather poignant and poignant is not a word I use to describe a Fulci film, yet the music is the star of that particular scene.

Despite the poignant moment described and the repulsive gore that is on display, ""The House by the Cemetery"" is one Fulci's slowest moving pictures. It opens with a couple of brutal slaying's but you'll have to wait at least another 30 minutes before another life is extinguished so those who are expecting a fast paced slasher film need to remember that this film moves at it's own pace. However, during it's few key moments, it delivers the gore in abundance and Fulci, as expected, leaves nothing to the imagination. There are head stabbings, throat-ripping's, and one of the most disturbing scenes involves a gorgeous actress loosing her head. What disturbed me about this movie was how well done many of these gore sequences were especially when the films obvious low budget is taken into consideration. For a moment there, it had me questioning my morals as a human being. Why do I like seeing innocent people suffer like this on screen? Why do I enjoy seeing innocent people being savagely carved up & slaughtered? I honestly can't answer these questions. I watch horror movies not because I enjoy watching horrible things happen to good people but mostly for the shock and the adrenaline pump that is sometimes felt when something unexpected or revolting is put on for your display. Whatever the reasons may be for enjoying the genre, this film did leave me with a very uncomfortable feeling after viewing it.

So please keep this in mind, if you can stomach the repulsiveness of these films, you should find ""House by the Cemetery"" interesting viewing and the three star rating I gave the film is solely for those who like this sort of morbid unpleasantness. All others, avoid at all costs. You will do yourself a dis-service by viewing these types of films.",1068336000,,2889,4.750996015936255
1409285,5,B000059PR3,"I really enjoyed this film a lot. I'd only seen one other Fulci film. That movie was really good, though i vaguely remember that parts of it made no sense. Still, i can't wait to own it on dvd. House By The Cemetery is a really good haunted house movie. Don't bother over-analyzing this movie. Just watch it with all the lights off like i did. The first thing i noticed was how incredibly great and effective the music was. The music that accompanies the opening credits and the scene immediately following that where the boy is looking at the photograph of the house is very beautiful.  That music reminded me of another memorable piece of music from the horror classic Phantasm. I love when horror movies use instrumental music instead of the current trend of using songs from current pop rock and heavy metal groups, which totally ruins things in my opinion. I love pop rock and heavy metal, but neither genre belongs in a horror movie because it just takes the scariness of the movie away totally. Horror movies should be about building atmosphere through music, not selling a current band's tunes.  I give the opening and closing credits music a five star rating. Secondly, the cinematography is excellent, and the director builds tension and suspense with good camera work and also the effective use of sound effects. The gore is fairly decent, and very excessive in several scenes, as it is with most Italian and Euro horror movies. A lot of people talk about the annoying kid in the movie. I thought he did a good job for a kid his age. They should have picked someone who looked more like a boy. I'm pretty sure his voice was dubbed, and they should have picked a better-sounding voice. Maybe it's the kid's voice that everyone finds annoying. All in all i really liked this movie a lot. It has some really great elements to it and i found it very stylish and effective. I'd definitely watch it again.",1067731200,4,1910,4.5982404692082115
1409286,1,B000059PR3,"This review is of the Diamond release of this film.  The movie itself is a superb entry into Fulci's body of work and Italian horror movies in general.  It has more taut suspense and more competent gore/effects than most other films in the genre.  This particular DVD however is one of the most poorly authored comercial DVDs I've ever seen.  First, the movie is broken into only 4 chapters, making finding a particular scene quite difficult and time consuming.  Second, the picture quality is in the fair to poor range (think pre-viewed VHS).  Third, the sound quality is that of a worn and warped record, with plenty of hiss and pops to compete with the mono soundtrack.  And finally (and also the most egregious offense), if you watch through the credits, at some point the screen will go black for about two minutes, then there's some digital blocking, followed by ten or so seconds of something (I'm not sure what, perhaps a trailer for the movie), and finally the screen turns blue and reads: ""Laser disc stop side-B""!  Hmmm, I wonder what they transfered this DVD from.  The only thing that makes this disc at all worth buying is the movie on it and its price.  If you really need to save the money, buy this disc.

1409287,4,B000059PR3,"Well, we're back in Fulci land.  Putting this up with Zombie, City,  and The Beyond, this is probably my least favorite.  That's not to say it's not fun, just the lesser in comparison to the others.  This time the threat hides in a basement instead of the island of Matool or the town of Dunwich.  There's no gates of hell to worry about or book of Enoch(or Eibon for that matter).  This time we got that wacky Dr. Freudstein up to his old rejuvenation-through-death-and-dismemberment shenanigans.  The usual Fulci tomfoolery happens: Scenes that are supposed to be scary, but end up being hilarious.  I'm thinking of the bat scene in particular.  Unnecessary closeups of eyes and a pointless psychic child.  So, this Freudstein ventures out of the cellar now and again to slaughter people that venture into the house.  He moves like molasses in January, but manages to get his victims anyway.  Though he's on a homicidal rampage, he never comes upstairs to kill the family that lives in the house, he just waits for them to come downstairs in the final ten minutes of the film.  The funniest scene has a terribly annoying kid trapped by the cellar door as Freudstein slowly creeps up the stairs after him.  Mom breaks the door key and a knife trying to open the door as the kid screams, making you wonder how the doctor ever gets out of the cellar if this door is such a hassle.  The doctor pushes the kid's head against the door as Dad tries to chop the door down with an axe, barely missing the kid's head each time.  Dad must not be too concerned coz he stops between axe swings to explain to Mom, who is in the cellar and what he's doing down there.  This scene is priceless and worth the price of the dvd alone.  As with all Fulci films, this ends on kind of a downer, though not as much as his previous films.  This is typical Fulci-ya love it or ya hate it, just don't take it to seriously or you lose all the fun.",1059264000,2,1922,4.409090909090909

The gore was really high in this movie, the killings were plain out crazy, which only made it freekier, thanx to the special effects which only made it more realistic. Anyway, I bought the version produced by DIAMOND ENTERTAINMENT DVD, It was 6.99, It was okay, no real extras except the director's Biography, the sound quality was week and un-restored (just like the VHS) and the image quality was pretty weak, lacking real strong colors, it seemed faded at points, definitely not restored much, but the 2.35:1 widescreen format was nice...can't wait to buy the Anchor Bay DVD of it, I heard the transfer is amazing and I heard the sound quality was better, too. Also, there is another version from EC entertainment with a nice transfer too (not as good as Anchor Bay's) but it did have a load of extras, but i'll stick with anchor bay, I'd rather have a top notch looking movie that was restored very well and you can tell it's dvd, then a decent transfer with lots of extras, plus, the Anchor Bay DVD has some extras, trailers, tv spots, bios, still gallerie...

Though not quite up to the standards set by such classics as Zombie2 and The Beyond, this still manages to be a very entertaining flick with some memorable terror. This is pure pulp horror and my guess is that if you are reading this review that is just what you are looking for. If you are a fan of Giallo and Italian horror then this is a must see.
One particularly memorable scene as pointed out by many is the one involving a maid mopping up a considerable amount of gore and the mistress of the house enquiring as to what she is doing. Her response: ""I made coffee"". Could this be Fulci trying to demonstrate the breakdown of communication in modern day families and households! Ha! I'm just kidding! Do not waste your time with overanalisys but simply allow yourself to be entertained as the realm of taboos is once again exploited by good old Itallian Horror.",1057795200,,914,4.479041916167665
1409291,4,B000059PR3,"For starters I genuinely enjoy Fulci's films and am a fan of senseless gore movies, so if your an average horror fan you should maybe deduct one star of my rating.
Anyhow, I've seen most of Fulci's film's, The Beyond being my favourite and the Anchorbay DVD of Beyond rocks, but House by the cemetary was one that I had not seen. I decided to buy the film as it was offten ranked as his third greatest (#1 Beyond, #2 Zombi but I like City of the Living Dead a little better than House as third) and also as it starred the super cute Fulci regular Catriona (Katherine) MacColl. I got the Diamond DVD as it was afordable and another guy in his review here said that he had being informed that although the Daimond version was rated 'R', it was actually the uncut version. And although a VERY graphic throat slashing scene remained intact and the rest of the film seemed uncut, I later read somewhere that a version 3 minutes longer was soon to be released. Whether or not the Diamond DVD here is the uncut version I cannot say.
House by the Cemetary basicly centres on a family moving into a house inhabited by a evil doctor who uses his victims fresh body parts to stay alive. It is filmed in typical Fulci style that critics consider full of continuety errors, while fans feel that this makes the films dream/nightmare like. I am fairly in between, I always believed that Fulcis camera technique is certainly artistic but he obviously can't tell a straight story and while this works brilliantly in the Beyond, it just makes some of his work very boring to sit through like Zombi. House had a genuinely eerie ambiance and Fulci does create a creepy atmosphere successfully but not to the extent of his master piece the Beyond.
Being Fulci, there is some great gore in this film. Theres a great throat slashing scene (mentioned above) which is an excellent effect and a knife in the back of the head scene, but there is also a very weak bat attack scene, the bat ten times more phoney than the fake spiders in the Beyond. There was not as much of Fulci's trademark gore in House as some of his other flicks, but once again the Diamond version is 84 minutes and I read somewhere that the uncut running time is 87 minutes, but this is the only version I've seen so I cannont coment.

It took me a little while to find this title, but it was worth it. Its right up there with the other Fulci greats such as Zombie, Gates Of Hell (city of the living dead), and The Beyond. Although it isn't technically a zombie movie, i loved in nonetheless. Dr. Freudstien is a crazed Zombie-like creature living in the cellar of a large, mansion like house and hungers for human flesh and sets out to devour the houses new inhabitants. I like it. If you're a fan of low-budget gory creepy movies, eurohorror, or you're a Fulci fan who still hasn't seen this one, I reccomend it.",1044489600,,694,4.346153846153846
1409293,5,B000059PR3,"House By The Cemetery is easily one of Fulci's most accomplished and impressive films. It just drips with atmosphere and features many wonderful set-pieces. The plot involves a family moving into a creepy house, which, unbeknown to them, contains a hideous and deadly secret. There's no need to know any more than this, and as a matter of fact, the plot is so full of huge gaping holes that you will have to forget about logic completely most of the time! But once you do this, you are in for some terrific entertainment. The film starts slowly, buliding a sense of foreboding about the house by introducing a ghostly little girl who communicates with the young son of the family. These scenes are delicate and appealing, and they contrast superbly with the scenes if gory horror that soon proliferate as the monster hiding within the house begins to claim his victims. While quite restrained when compared to ""The Beyond"" or ""Zombi"", the murder scenes on display are still pretty shocking, especially the death of one victim whose foot is trapped in a cracked floor; she is stabbed to death slowly and repeatedly, with the camera closing in on every blood spurt! There's also a real jolt in a scene when the young son is trapped behind the cellar door and his father tries to break it down with an axe...watch out for it! This then leads to the real surprise, which is the last twenty minutes of the film when the family face the monster in the cellar, and have to take it in turns fight for their lives...the suspense is superb, and Fulci has never equalled it since.
Beautifully shot in widescreen, the sets and locations look stunning, and the monster, when finally seen, is truly repulsive! I wholeheartedly recommend this to all horror fans",1042070400,2,1746,4.709150326797386
1409294,3,B000059PR3,"A young professor, his Barbie-doll wife, and their young son go on a sabbatical.  They move into an old house by an ancient cemetery, and bloody death ensues.  After a steady diet of classic horror flicks and '50s style sci-fi schlock, come along as we venture into '80s stylized violence.  Talk about culture shock!  Vampires, werewolves, and radioactive dinosaurs seem mild compared to a deranged killer that sprays blood around in glorious color.  Horrible death notwithstanding, the scariest thing in this movie is the whiny little kid named Bob.  (Why pick on guys named Bob?).  Bob gets our vote for the Donnie Dunagan award.  Little Dunagan played the cutesy and annoying tyke in ""Son of Frankenstein.""  Bob sees dead people, of course.  Mainly a little girl dressed in 19th century garb.  Also, he can't stay out of the basement.  The house is haunted by the undead remnant of Dr. Freudstein.  We assume that the Freud and Frankenstein family lines crossed at some point in the distant past.  Freudstein needs plentiful amounts of human blood to keep going.  The script has difficulty focusing between a slasher flick and a ghost story.  The plot is both suspenseful and silly.  At times, it even gets confusing.  Who, for example, is the enigmatic baby-sitter that has strange ties to a store-window mannequin?  The story doesn't conclude, it just stops after 80+ minutes.  Maybe they were setting up a sequel.  The killing is gory, but limited in scope.  There is not a new victim every five minutes.  Italian director Lucio Fulci enjoys a loyal following among genre fans and cult enthusiasts.  For collectors, this gem is worth the price. ;-)",1039737600,,1654,4.930909090909091

Anyway, this movie definitly ranks right up there with the all time scariest movies I've seen!  Of coarse the actors aren't good, the voice overs aren't good, but I'll tell you now, that Euro Horror, just scares the crap out of me.  It's dark, sadistic and wonderful!

1409296,2,B000059PR3,"House by the Cemetary. Lucio Fulci has been one of my favorite horror directors since I first watched the genre masterpiece. This film, in true Lcio fashion, offers up all the gore and all the horror as is expected from this great director. However, at times it moves rather slowly, and the gore is no where near sufficient for the die hard Lucio fan. Strong elements of the film however, include tense atmosphere and a sense of lurking danger. For the most part however, I would resommend the film Zombie for a true taste of Lucio's genius. I give this film two stars.",1032307200,,569,4.533980582524272
1409297,5,B000059PR3,"Anchor Bay are to be commended for releasing classics by directors like Fulci and Argento, even more so for presenting clean transfers (not counting ZOMBIE), in the fullest uncut versions, AND IN THE ORIGINAL ASPECT RATIO.
HOUSE's transfer really shows off Fulci's ability to create a magnificent atmosphere, and is evident of his mastery of composition in the 'scope format.
The film is one of Fulci's best. It isn't as volcanic as THE BEYOND, but it's probably just as brilliant. It forsakes the Surrealist logic of the former film, it doesn't jump abstractly from one seemingly unconnected moment to the next, and is far more linear in its story telling. But that is not to say that HOUSE shirks the weird nightmare qualities: it just builds up to them a little mre slowly. By the end you'll still feel as though you've been taken into another strange world. The story itself isn't anything special; it plays on certain archetypes of the haunted house flick and the zombie in the cellar set piece. But what elevates this film above such popular classics as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, the slightly overrated LET SLEEPING CORPSES LIE and others is Fulci's total command of the formal aspects of cinema. The visuals and sounds are unlike anything else.
Almost every image in the film is beautiful and melancholy. At times the film has the oneiric quality of dreams and nightmares. Fulci composes his images as a painter would. The link between Fulci's cinema and painting is heightened by the motif of the ghosts in the painting, as the line between the corporeal (the physical world) and the ethereal (the world of ghosts associated with the painting)is blurred until it is obliterated in the haunting finish. Many people will find the atmosphere too depressing, but it enhances the film's power.
I must also comment on the music. It perfectly complemented the imagery, and is truly eerie. The acting is good, too, especially Ania Peroni as a weirdo babysitter. The close ups of her eyes are unsettling.
Overall, I would highly recommend this for people interested in Euro horror, because this is one of the finest examples. Also, people interested in formalism and poetic cinema combined with horror will also be impressed. It is not for all tastes. It won't satisfy gore hounds because there are only three or four scenes of pure horror. But it's still great.",1031961600,4,2361,4.875621890547263

Unfortunately, the narrative of the movie is very thin. For the most part, the ""plot"" is incomprehensible. I give this film 3 stars very reluctantly due to the fact that the movie permeates a sense of creepiness, evil, & doom that suits a lot of great horror films. Fulci has a flair of style, undoubtedly. His horror films have a menacing aura (THE BEYOND & ZOMBIE are good examples). But other than that, his films lack the substance that makes great horror films, & that is a cohesive narrative.
Still, I enjoyed the mood & creepiness of the film. Interesting note is that former sexpot Dagmar Lassander is in this movie, albeit briefly, & gets quicly dispatched in a horribly sadistic fashion after her introduction.

I would rate this film a 4, but I had to subtract a star for 2 annoying characters (the dad and Bob), a long boring period in the first half of the movie, and an ending that was very unsatisfying.
First off, the violence and gore is top notch- Fulci delivers the goods big time although you have to wait a while to get to the good scenes. Some of the highlights: knife through the skull, lady gets polked full of holes and her blood squirts all over the place in massive quantities (hard to watch), a guy's throat gets ripped open and blood gushes like a fountain, Dr. Freudstein is stabbed and globs of maggots fall out of his wounds, a girl gets her throat slashed and then (my favorite) her head bounces down the stairs. The deaths were very graphic and on par with the Beyond although very different. Dr. Freudstein is a great monster, and it was awesome when we get to see him for the first time. I have to say that the father was the biggest wuss and I cheered when he got slaughtered. The kid Bob deserved to die too because he was so stupid and annnoying. I felt cheated when he got away at the end.

I enjoyed it. I was, however, very impressed with the crisp, moody photography (in a WIDE letterbox) and, all in all, I think I made a good investment. One thing that often bothered me about dubbed, Italian films of this period is that they are often boring, relying only on gore.

The format has evolved from his previous outings of hordes of zombies to a spookier, phsychic-ghost story instead. In fact, it's kind of a cheap-skate version of The Shining.
To really appreciate this film (or any of Fulci's horror films) you have to be prepared to forgive a lot of cinematic badness. Dubbing, dialogue, plot coherence, the occasional dodgy special effect (not so bad in this film - no one can forgive the toy spiders in The Beyond) ... as a matter of fact, you may wonder what's so great about this film at all. Well, I'll tell you ... Fulci is a master cinematographic ""painter"". Scenes look gorgeous, and they really suit the feel of this gothic film. Also, Fulci has a habit of pulling something really shocking out of the hat at a moment's notice (you'll know it when you see it - let's just say in this film it involved a child's head, a door and an axe). But what really turns on the legion of Fulci fans out there is the gore. Set piece, outrageous gore scenes pop up ever fifteen to twenty minutes as minor characters walk on only to get bumped off in various splattery ways. House isn't as gory as his earlier zombie films but it's still pretty hard. (BTW - although the case says Rated: R, this is the uncut version of the film.)

What u have to do is get a bunch of friends over, pop in this dvd & let the laughs begin.  The reason this movie is so funny is the dubbing & dialog.  The little boy is hysterical(""mommy bring me back some can-dy!) it's just has to be heard to be believed (""damned tombstone"")The little boy looks like the love child of Angelina Jolie & Ann Jillian, I still think it is a little girl.  Don't believe any reviewer who tells you this movie is scary, it should be listed as a comedy but like I said earlier it's well worth the money if you are a lover of really BAD movies. give this a try it will make you smile.",991094400,,902,4.096590909090909
1409321,5,B000059PR3,For me this is definately my favourite Fulci film after Zombie. Its a bit more conventional as a pose to his usual outrageous horror. The dubbing is dodgy for the two children but all of his films have pretty bad dubbing. The one thing that this film has that some of his other films don't is tension. Especially in the scene when the celler door gets open. It also in my opinion contains some of his most controversial graphic violence from any of his films.  For the money that I paid for this I was very happy as this is the most uncut english language translation with all of the gore intact. Allot of people moan about different running times in these italian horrors. Particulary Tenebrae and phenomena. The scenes that weren't included in tenebrae where never even recorded in english.  Diamond have transferred the japanese laserdisk very well and the colors are good throughout. My only complaints are that the film is in mono and that its only split into four chapters.  Anchor bays version will probably be a better print with a 5.1 soundtrack but ill stick with my plain jane version.,983059200,3,1096,4.639175257731959
1409322,5,B000059PR3,"This movie is wonderful with a touch of cheesiness I look for in movies of this genre.  The child actors are much more disturbing than the movie itself, but that has to be seen to be believed...",982886400,,194,4.243243243243243
1409323,4,B000059PR3,"This version of ""House by the Cemetary"" is the uncut version, copied by Diamond Entertainment from the Japanese Laserdisc. It is a reasonably good looking transfer except for the occasional greyscaling and evidence of filmgrain. It is one of Lucio's best combining elements of ""The Shining"" and ""Hellraiser"" with a truly creepy feel. The earlier video release from Vestron video had reels 2 and 3 out of order. They have been put back correctly making the story all the more interesting. A great buy if you're a collecter. If not you may want to wait for Anchor Bay's version coming April 24th. This film scared me as a child and still retains a lot of it's eerie feel that time and many other horror films have ruined with less stylistic displays of the same idea.  PS - If you wait long enough after the film ends, you see 5 seconds of the end of the trailer and ""Laserdisc stop side B"" will appear.",981072000,3,901,4.52760736196319
1409324,3,B000059PR3,"Like most Fulci horror films, it has its good and its bad. It is entertaining, scary, and laughable all at once. The fx is at times painfully fake and other times competent. Fulci throws in his standard slash and slice sexual allusions. In all his films, somehow, whether it be in the acting, the story, or the fx,  Fulci always leaves something to be desired and mucks things up. Still, it adds up to being a fine guilty pleasure.
It is in the simple scenes and the gloomy setting that the film works well. But, in other scenes it is painfully bad (though entertaining) like- the attack by the Uber-bat, or when the Nanny is mopping up gore on the kitchen floor, the wife asks what she's doing, the Nanny's reply, `I made coffee', and then the wife just moves on ignoring the weird response and the slaughterhouse mess on the floor. One must also mention that the film completely falls apart at the end which is puzzling, abrupt, and downright silly.
The Diamond Entertainment DVD is great for the budget concious movie fan. The picture and sound are more than adequate considering the price, and the film is uncut.",980899200,,1116,4.58
1409325,2,B000059PR3,"This film is just plain boring, as are most of Fulci's films infact.  There is no atmosphere, the dialogue and some scenes are laughable(and not in a good way) and the dubbing of the main childs voice is incredibly annoying.  The picture quality is pretty good for the price(certainly as good as Anchor Bay's release of Zombie) and the sound quality is also decent, although the music itself seems to burst in and dissapear at the most inappropriate times.  The only reason it doesn't get 1 star is because there is some decent gore, although not enough to save it.  I certainly won't be watching it again.",978220800,,606,4.635514018691588
1409326,4,B000059PR3,House by the cemetry was a great fulci movie with lots of blood and gore. Its about some dead guy in the basement who kills people who come down there. He slits a chicks neck so many times her head falls off. GREAT PRICE FOR A FULCI MOVIE! There were two bad things: 1. It said direct scene access ( go to your favorite scenes) thats a bunch of crap there are only 4 chapters in a 84 min. movie. But what do you expect Diamond entertainment made it. 2. that little kid named Bob in that movie that looks like a girl HE NEEDS TO DIE! other than that its a cool horror movie. I would have gave it 5 stars but that little kid in the movie made me change my mind.,977961600,,659,3.925373134328358
1409327,5,B000059PR3,"I love this movie! What a great transfer, the sound kind of bites but at least this classic is available on dvd. The same people behind this disc brought us ""Pieces"", another classic in it's own right. Back to this Fulci flick, House has some great gore, a 10 on the Splatter Ladder in my books. With City of Living Dead and The Beyond on dvd now, I'm loving life. For those who don't know, the director of House, Lucio Fulci, passed away a couple of years back, his memory lives on in digital. R.I.P.",976752000,2,501,4.28421052631579
1409328,3,B000059PR3,"My rating reflects my affinity for ""B"" movies.  The three stars are ""B"" movie stars, not ""normal"" movie stars.  I am being a little generous since this is only my first review, and there was a very little bit of skin during the opening credits.  If I could I'd give it 2  stars, but I rounded up.  If you aren't into 70's and 80's ""B"" movies, if you only watch ""good"" movies, then you can consider this movie a zero.
The DVD video quality is very good, and as others have mentioned, it is in wide screen format.  The audio quality is clean; however, there is poor volume control.  At times the characters are so quiet, they can not be heard; at other times the volume goes high and well past the pain threshold.  I understand this was most likely done for effect, but it is so badly done I almost wonder if it wasn't caused by an error in the transfer process, which appears to have come directly from laser disc.  As the price would suggest, there are no frills or extras with this DVD.  The movie is adequately dubbed.
There are the expected plot problems; in fact, the plot gets down right confused at points.  In my opinion, Fulci failed to fully utilize the creepy Librarian character.  While the gore is pretty cheesy, it was ample, and managed to make me squirm more than once.  The ""Bat scene"" was a laugh riot, and there is some hilarious dialogue in the film.  The husband is tasked with consoling his nervous wife saying things like, ""This is New England, everybody has a tomb in their house"".  Lucio Fulci nailed my childhood fears of the basement, and I believe many people will appreciate this as well.  I wish there had been more development on how Dr. Freudstein used his victim's to stay alive.  Any demonstration is notably absent though it is mentioned on the back cover, as well as once in the last 10 minutes of the movie.  This is not Lucio Fulci best work, but it had its moments, and in between the obligatory confusion, managed to scare me.  If you're a fan of the genre, then by all means, rent it.  If you are a hard core Fulci fan, and already own better titles like Zombie, then you can't beet the price of adding it to your collection.",976579200,7,2165,4.37844611528822
1409329,4,B000059PR3,"First of all, I liked the movie.  Lots of gore, good suspence, and a thing in the cellar.  Be warned though, this movie has a typical Fulci ending - you end up saying ""what was that all about?""  I don't know what DVD the other reviewers were watching but mine was not a good transfer.  The dark/black scenes were quantized to a gray scale with very little contrast and sometimes almost looked like negatives.  There are only four scenes to select from in the menu and my Pioneer Elite player couldn't even detect the end of the movie.  At this time, no one like Anchor Bay has this movie so this is the way to go.  I'd buy it again.",975888000,,632,4.216666666666667
1409330,4,B000059PR3,"I love horror movies, and have a soft spot for low budget horror films made during the late 70s and into the 80s.  Lucio Fulci was one of the masters of the low-budget, fast-make gore films.  I had never seen this one before, but I had seen Zombie 2, his unofficial sequel to George Romero's Night of the Living Dead, so I kind of new what to expect.  I was not disappointed.
Lots of atmosphere, lots of blood and gore, and a story that was downright eerie.  The music had a haunting, melancholy flavor that was very appropriate for the story line.  The players, including the two principal children costars, were more than adequate. Of course you're going to see weak plot points (for instance, where'd all the blood go when the baby sitter was decapitated and just moments later two principal characters walk onto the scene, and it's a dry and dusty floor; in reality, they'd be slipping and sliding like a panicked cat on ice), but then again, you can get the same kind of weak plot points in a John Carpenter film, and I don't seem to mind them either.  You just expect it to happen in this kind of movie.  Look past the weaknesses, and what you've got in ""House by the Cemetery"" is almost a homage to the great Hammer Films of the 60s and 70s.  You've got a gothic ghost story, with a Ghoul that feeds on warm living flesh to stay alive, like a vampire.  The scene in the basement, when we see where the ""good Doctor Freudstein"" does his butchering with dirty surgical tools on a steel table top, made me think of the recent remake of ""House On Haunted Hill""; some tricks of the trade never change.
Surprisingly, for such a low cost DVD, it was presented wonderfully, in Wide Screen format, with restored sound and music.  It includes a short Bio on Fulci, and nice scene access, should you decide you want to see some finely done vivisectioning over and over again.
If you like horror and you like gore to the extent you find yourself leaping up and laughing at the over-the-top-splatter, then you'll love this film.  Great Buy.",975369600,11,2034,4.47027027027027

7934100,5,B000059PR3,"When I first saw this movie I got a DVD for it at a good sized movie store out of a cheap bin with the DVD offering no bonus's.  I had never seen this movie before at the time and didn't honestly know what to expect.  I watched it and it hit all the right chords with me in no time flat.  Since then I have gotten the 2-disc DVD and finally the Blu-ray.  With this Blu-ray there is no turning back as the picture quality is exemplary.  Things that weren't in the clearest of view in the background are far more clear, the somewhat drab colors are much brighter now, and the soundtrack just simply has never sounded better that this.

What this movie has to offer is a little bit of great nudity, a tremendous slasher killer style, tremendous gore, a mysterious killer of whom is not what you think, the big mystery behind who the killer is and where the killer is hiding, beautifully done cinematography, effectively creepy and intense music, and some really good camera work as well.

Since I can't think of a way of describing this movie without giving away too much, I will just focus on it's great strengths instead.

The atmosphere for instance is quite foreboding being that there is a nearby cemetery, an old house that is said to have people enter and never be heard from again, mysterious people of whom might be ghosts or just local eccentrics appear from time to time, while the house is near a city, it is located out in the middle of nowhere, and the house's basement is a mystery as it is for some reason, locked tightly forbidding access to it.

There's not alot to say about the characters.  There's a hardworking husband/father to Bob named Norman Boyle, his beautiful and caring wife and mother to Bob, Lucy Boyle, their son Bob of whom keeps seeing and hearing very strange things, a mysterious little German girl and her equally mysterious mother, a beautiful yet eerie nanny to Bob, one realtor of whom tries to warn people about the house but no one ever listens to him, the assigned realtor who moves the family in, and some business associates of the fathers.

The scene where they fight with a vicious bat is somewhat scary but also kind of unintentionally hilarious.

Of the kill scenes my most favorite would have to be the one where the killer kills one of his victims by stabbing the knife so rough through the back of the victims head that the blade comes out through her mouth.  One awesome gore effect.

The musical score by Walter Rizzati is so intense and so wickedly freaky and at times atmospheric that it brings the fear of what's to come and even what is happening to a one tension-filled and terrifying level.",1490486400,3,2648,4.489583333333333
