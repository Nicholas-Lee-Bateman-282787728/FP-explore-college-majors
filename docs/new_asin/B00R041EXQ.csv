You will learn or be reminded of events that have begun to fade from memory. How could this be forty years ago? This recounting brings it back; the courage, the treachery, the panic, the hope. Then in 1975 the evacuations as Saigon is falling to the enemy.
One scene is truly epic. People are desperately fleeing Saigon but escape becomes nearly impossible. A Vietnamese pilot takes the risk of his life flying a commandeered helicopter with little fuel and his family on board in an attempt to reach a U.S. carrier. No scene in any film can hold a candle to what this man did on that day. That scene alone is worth the price of the DVD.",1477526400,3,775,4.388888888888889

6891366,5,B00R041EXQ,"Last Days in Vietnam PBS  2104 Not Rated  Blu-Ray version

After some truly execrable work on Vietnam [see prior reviews] this competently done history of the final months of American troop involvement in Vietnam seems like a masterpiece of world cinema.  Its fairly standard documentary: a mixture of actual contemporary footage, interviews with Americans and South Vietnamese who lived through the experience, and with military officials and historians who provide some broader perspective on the action.
I don't think the documentary as a whole had a political axe to grind.  One can see why various actors took the (conflicting) positions they did.  Even the Communists [none are interviewed] seem to have acted somewhat reasonably [and in their own self interest] in allowing the Americans and their South Vietnamese alliesat least, as many as could be accommodated in a short period of time anyhowa fairly safe retreat compared to what it might have been.  For a war that that I think many Americans feel was one of our worst hours, I ended up feeling  proud of the way most Americans performed in a chaotic and desperate situation.  Would we perform as well in a similar situation today?  I have some doubts.  B+",1452816000,3,1219,5.014925373134329

The interviews are compelling, and the quality of the program all around is excellent. Hawk or dove, this is a must-see film about a difficult time in American history. I've been to Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City) twice. I love seeing the places I've been as they were in the early/mid-1970s.

6891373,5,B00R041EXQ,"During those last days, I was working with the ""G.I. Movement,"" the soldiers (and others in the military) who had become the most vocal part of the anti-war movement. My work began on this stuff in 1966, and continued until after the war's end. This movie is very very important for people teaching the history of that very complex era. It's also important so that we don't continue to repeat the mindless invocations of the wrong ""lessons"" from ""Vietnam"" (as a historical artifact, rather than as fact).

For me, watching the movie, it was very important to watch the history of Barry Romo's evolution as he became one of the best leaders of Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW). As you can still report, Barry Romo is still active in popular organizing here in Chicago. Many of us came to our opposition to that war via the same Catholic upbringing that Barry Romo talks about. With Pope Francis speaking about justice in the USA today, it's even more poignant.

I was also glad to see so much from the former CIA people whose friends were betrayed during those horrible final weeks. Everyone was betrayed by what the USA did, and this video helps point our histories in the right direction. Of course, the heroism of those who ""brought out"" our Vietnamese friends during those final hours is best reported in this film of anywhere I've studied. But of course the people we left behind are a left out part of the story that can virtually never be really told as history.

As a retired teacher who taught ""Vietnam"" in his literature classes, I am very happy that this video (and some others, not as poignent) exists. After years of reviewing the fiction (and poetry) of ""Vietnam"", I settled on teaching John DelVecchio's ""The 13th Valley"" -- as opposed to the more usually taught Tim O'Brien's ""The Things They Carried."" The reason was that my friends who actually saw combat in ""the 'Nam"" insisted that DelVecchio has written THE BOOK about their experience. It's accuracy included the fact that it faced the horrific complexity of combat and created Vietnamese characters who were fully realized, while respecting the nuances of the history we had lived those horrid years.

""Last Days in Vietnam"" now stands on a short shelf of necessary works to understand what really happened -- a corrective, among many, to the silly Sylverster Stallone or David Petraeus oversimplifications. (Stallone's cowardice during the war has been surpassed by his hypocrisy since, but now that we have Donald Trump's version of reality, even Stallone recedes into second place).

But it's important for us to have a fully developed debate over the myths that have been painted over the realities of ""Vietnam"" so that we don't continue to repeat the real errors of ""Vietnam."" It wasn't until I was well on my way (as the first I-O in Elizabeth, New Jersey) into organizing and doing legal aid for military men and women (and later, Vietnam Vets) that I had learned many of the facts of history we should have known earlier. But ""we"", in our arrogance, didn't pay attention to the stories told by men like Bernard Fall (""Street Without Joy"" is even more important than ""Hell in a Very Small Place"" to inform real thinking) and Graham Greene (""the Quiet American"" is still worth reviewing as we go back and ask, again, WTF?!! when the USA again plunges into an imperial adventure ignoring history. By the late 1960s, thousands of us -- including many men in the ""boonies"" of Vietnam -- knew the thousand year struggle of the Vietnamese people against their imperial northern neighbor. And so we were not surprised when Vietnam had to turn and fight against China within a couple of years after the end of the American version of those realities.

And so today we come to the latest news:

-- Men who saw actual combat in Iraq and Afghanistan are killing themselves at a frightening rate. The ""good"" thing is that thanks to the reporting in The New York Times, we are at least facing the fact that ""PTSD"" is very VERT different for the men and women who experiences sustained combat than it is for those who have suffered other ""trauma."" Without belittling other traumas, I insist that the trauma of combat, especially sustained combat, is singular, and that we were right to identify ""Post Vietnam Syndrome"" in the late 1960s and early 1970s (I say ""we"" because I was among those who did) and insist that it was not simply one other ""traumatic experience,"" but a thing unique to the people -- men and women -- who actually experienced combat in war.

-- And now today, thanks to the lies of the latest generation of ""counter insurgency"" people, we are reading (again in The New York Times) that American marines and GIs are supposed to sit around and say ""That's OK"" when our ""allies"" in Afghanistan go around raping children and you adults because that's been part of their so-called ""culture.""

There is much much more we can learn from ""Vietnam"" as we move forward from our latest blindnesses about ""counter insurgency"" and the role of the USA as the tough cop everywhere on Earth. But watching ""Last Days in Vietnam"" is one of many possible starts for those who now look at ""Vietnam"" as ancient history.",1443139200,,5190,4.745011086474501

6891379,5,B00R041EXQ,"I remembered when I heard about this film as an Oscar nominee, I remareked to friends that I didn't even hear of it. The Edward Snowden doc won that year's Oscar, but my God, is this an intense, detailed, jaw-dropping masterwork of storytelling and archival footage! Using top of the line graphics, film shot on the ground, interviews with the men who were there, and a score that highlights the dread and the struggle of attempting to save as many in Saigon before the North Vietnamese could enter the city, I couldn't believe what mistakes were made, and what courage many Americans and South Vietnamese had on that final day. Any of the war hawks who think the American military can just roll over anybody should watch at how we were driven out at the end of Vietnam through a combination of military and diplomatic errors that rightfully left us embarrassed, but showed individual heroism in saving thousands of refugees from certain slaughter. The footage taken at sea aboard the naval ships by itsself is worth the price of the film. I considered it a privilege to watch it on PBS for free.

To say, as it does, that the North Vietnamese were ready to give up a war they were winning because Nixon scared them is ridiculous. And if they had given up, is that what we wanted-- another Korea?  What if England had ""intervened"" in our Civil War and established the Confederacy as its cotton-pickin' puppet.  How would that be?
To mention North Vietnamese atrocities against the South Vietnamese and not mention the atrocities that the South Vietnamese committed against the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese is-- whitewash.  And some of those South Vietnamese atrocities were committed by the same people that the CIA and U.S. Military smuggled out of the country in their million dollar helicopters-- their ""friends.""

I don't know how US got in that situation and obviously no one would know either since politics are in play but it is obvious that North Vietnam knew that US was vulnerable due to Nixon leaving office. The sad part of this documentary is not what happened then some forty years ago in Vietnam since we have experienced more wars with no results, but more importantly what US is experiencing now. No wonder Putin is pushing his luck after President's 2015 State of the Union Address since he may be anticipating what North Vietnamese anticipated then. If US gets involved in Ukraine, with only fifteen percent approval rating for Congress, we Americans will be witnessing another Last Days In Vietnam. This documentary shows what happens when we do not have our act together. Painful documentary to watch and it will even be more painful unless we really get our act together.

6891586,5,B00R041EXQ,"Outstanding--a must see for everyone--veterans, historians, students, protestors, etc. The people who are interviewed in this well edited show are people who were there--not a bunch of scholars and college professors pushing their own agenda as in most documentaries. And those Marines, embassy staff, CIA employees, etc. at the embassy on 4/30/75 are real heroes--overcoming the stupidity of the ambassador and the politicians in DC that week while saving many lives. Incredible amateur and media footage shot in and around Saigon during the fall of the city make this more exciting to watch than any Hollywood blockbuster.",1430784000,6,624,5.443298969072165
6891587,5,B00R041EXQ,"Since I was stationed at Tan Son Nhut Air Base outside of Saigon during the Vietnam War I thought it be interesting to watch this video.  Sometimes I was hesitating about PBS Productions with their Bias point of views but this Video was very informative and just stuck to the Facts of the collapse of South Vietnam in its Final Days.  When Saigon fell in April 1975 my heart just sank in my throat as I watched it on TV.  I thought about all the service men and women I served with in South Vietnam.  The video was full of behind the scenes information from Ambassador  Graham who was in complete denial that South Vietnam was about to collapse from the invasion of 160,000 North Vietnamese Troops.  Many individuals disobeyed orders and took matters into their own hands and helped evacuate untold thousands of Vietnamese who would of been persecuted and the flight to freedom by plane, boat, and the last option was by helicopter.  One thing that was overlooked and never mentioned was the C5 that crashed after taking off killing on all board that was mainly orphan children.  Why they left that part out is unknown because that was part of the Flight from Saigon.",1430611200,18,1167,4.603864734299517
6891588,5,B00R041EXQ,"I can understand why Citizen Four won the Academy Award. It is more timely and well done. Nonetheless,  Last Days in Vietnam is thoroughly engrossing, tense, well done and quite a story. It's 40 years ago this month when the Americans finally exited Vietnam and it seems like only yesterday. I think about what would have happened had Rory Kennedy's dad become President. For starters she wouldn't have made this film showing in excruciating detail the limits of American power. The disaster of American involvement would have ended a lot earlier.",1430265600,4,547,5.010989010989011
6891589,5,B00R041EXQ,"As one who served a tour with the Army in combat in Vietnam, I must commend PBS on this outstanding history of one of the saddest, but at he same time heroic episodes in our history.  It portrays the actual events with fairness and honesty, of the pressures and issues involved, the tragedy of the Vietnam people, the loyalty and respect the Americans in Vietnam felt toward the Vietnamese people, the anguish of the American Ambassador Martin, who felt such a strong emotional tie to the Vietnamese people and the cause of their freedom that he prevented evacuation planning for fear of causing panic and chaos, and the frustration of the Americans attempting to evacuate the Vietnamese, but obstructed by all sorts of problems.  This should be seen by all Americans, and especially by young Americans, many of whom have a distorted view of the role their county played in this war.",1430265600,23,883,4.802631578947368

Sad to see so many desperate citizens trying to get out of their homeland and it was ALL our fault.  58, 220 U.S. dead for NOTHING!  2 discs come with this set.
