3966329,3,B002Q7T79K,"I consider myself a beer geek - I have a built-in kegerator at home with a two-tap faucet and only serve craft beers.  When I heard about this movie I bought it immediately hoping that it would give me some behind the scenes looks at some of the small guys with some information on regulation and the changing taste preferences for craft beers.

I loved the first hour (of 90 min total) of this movie.  It gave some great background on Sam Calagione, founder of Dogfish Head, and of the startup brewery Moonshot Beer (which I had never heard of despite in its city of origin).  During this time of the movie it really builds upon some of the hard-working entrepreneurial spirit of some of the small beer founders and shows some of the challenges of the industry.  There are a few moments when Anit states facts that have you raising eyebrows but for the most part it makes you want to never buy Budweiser, Miller, or Coors products again (78% of the market).
...then it turned into a Michael Moore movie.

The last third of this movie was horrible, and undid all the anti-Budweiser sentiment the first part of the movie established.  By the end we were rolling our eyes and chalking the industry up to good ol' fashion capitalism.  Sure, the legislation behind the 3-tier system (Brewers, Distributors, Stores) needs some reform but who can blame Budweiser for looking out for their own profits?

Takeaways:
1)  Previously I thought Dogfish Head as a great brewery but  thought Sam Calagione was a reincarnation of Bill & Ted.  I now have absolutely nothing but respect for him and his passion.  I'm certainly going to go out of my way to support DFH when I can and he's always welcome at my bar.
2) Moonshot is bound to fail.  With 16 well-written reviews on [...] it has an ""F"" rating - the first of its type that I've ever seen on the site in my 6+ years as a member.  ([...])
3) The three-tier system needs reform but the public will need to get involved to make such reform happen as only the Big Three brewers (now two) have the resources to afford lobbyists in their favor.  (I'll just continue to vote with my dollars.)

Overall, I wouldn't pay $20 to see this again.  NetFlix it or borrow it from a friend.  While I love supporting the craft beer industry this movie fell short on delivering.

3966330,3,B002Q7T79K,"This movie was okay; that's about it.

It kind of played like one of my undergrad papers would have read. I felt like there was a lot of good content and argumentation that could have led us in any number of directions. The conclusion, however, felt rushed and thrown together to meet time or spaced deadlines. What I'm saying is that it felt like starting out the night with a porter and ending with a big branded lite beer.

There was some guilt by association, but nothing to show (really) what sort of legislation was being guided by the PAC money being spent. In addition, this was a clear smear against AB, who was ultimately purchased by InBev (and mentioned as such in the film - which made the attacks against AB throughout the film seem ultimately silly). There wasn't a coherent line of argument that showed that a bias exists because certain groups exist to push out the small guys.

Yet, this is the point that was being made. Baron is trying to convince us that greedy corporations are pushing out the mom and pops for the sake of share holder satisfaction.

Nothing really new here, but the argument could have been more convincing with better investigations.

I would have liked to have seen more about the craft breweries - what are they dealing with and / or going through to produce their product and stay competitive. While I hold to my AB smear theory, I think this is also a clear advert for Dogfish Head (not that this is a bad thing - I LOVE their beers); Sam (the founder) has more face time than even Anat Baron. Too, there was a lot of East Coast representation (again; not a bad thing - I live in Philly and travel a lot in New England for work - this is what I usually drink; I would have liked to have heard more about some of the Left Coast's stories. There were some other brewers who got their 3 minutes of fame, but it seemed like Baron spent all of her time in Delaware with Sam Calagione.

Altogether, an interesting watch because of the features on Dogfish Head and Sam Adams but nothing that really gets me going (like Who Killed the Electric Car did...)",1269648000,7,2092,4.420779220779221
3966331,3,B002Q7T79K,"Not a bad effort but it was real clear this film had a real agenda and wasn't gonna give even a small break to the big 3. I drink all types of beer from the small time brew houses to A&B/Miller products as well. And while some of the small crafted beers are DARN good and well worth the price there are many times when these beers are a sham and do not really warrant the seven to twelve dollar a six pack price and are trading on the idea of being a micro brew,and a Macro Brew  in this case is a better value and a better beer. She never once gave the flip side of the coin.

I would say this film is worth watching but you have to sift thru her agenda to get to the real truth.",1267833600,,680,3.8156028368794326
3966332,3,B002Q7T79K,"Beer Wars is one of those documentaries where you really need to consider the source: an individual who openly explains that she bailed out of corporate America because she didn't like the politics and competition decides to make a documentary about one of the most political and competitive industries in the world. Furthermore, she chooses an industry based on recreational alcohol consumption when she claims to be ""allergic"" to alcohol and personally avoids alcoholic beverages. (You have to wonder why she even includes these personal facts as they don't really help her credibility.) Finally, she made a film about the American beer industry, especially the fine art of microbrews and craft brews, when she also refers to Mike's Hard Lemonade as ""beer"" (Mike's Hard Lemonade is a little malt liquor and a lot of flavoring syrup, like a soda pop with a little kick - it's really a stretch to put that in the same category as a traditional beer). In watching the documentary, you can quickly pick up on how the filmmaker's personal feelings have had a disproportionately large impact on the documentary's message.

What exactly should we expect from a documentary on the beer industry made by this particular filmmaker? Not much. Happily, we get a bit more than that from Beer Wars, but you have to pay attention to see the actual substance.

The film's quirky approach is a little distracting as Anat Baron, the narrator and filmmaker, tries hard to make us feel sorry for some small time brewers, especially Dogfish Head and Moonshot. It's hard to feel sorry for Dogfish Head: they started from nothing in 1995 and were doing $28M in revenue by 2009. In 2012, they shipped 171,000 bbls and recently completed a $52 Million expansion. It's easy to admire Dogfish and root for them as a good brand with great innovation and a solid product, but I don't feel sorry for them. Moonshot, on the other hand, was portrayed in a depressing light. It became painful to watch the Moonshot owner, Rhonda, struggling to raise money for a brand with only a gimmick to set it apart. As a final complaint, Beer Wars spends too much time with too few of the brewers. Anat clearly spoke with many other fascinating breweries and it would have been nice to get to know more of them, especially as many of them have done very well in the years since this documentary was made. Dogfish Head is an interesting story, but given the severely lopsided screen time, I can't help but wonder how much of a hand Sam Calagione of Dogfish Head had in financing or otherwise enabling this documentary.

One of the most interesting aspects of Beer Wars was the light it sheds on the lobbying and litigation practices of the big players in the beer industry. It explains the impact of the three-tier alcohol distribution system and how this federally-enforced distribution system is a barrier to entry for small brewers. The structure of the beer industry is very interesting and the documentary manages to explain some aspects of it rather well. A lot of the information could be updated as there has been an explosion in the number of microbreweries in recent years (many of them highly successful), but you will still walk away with a better understanding of the legal barriers which shaped the industry for generations - at least since Prohibition. You will be able to explain why there were so few microbreweries until recently.

Conclusively, Beer Wars beats the same, tired, drum that big bad corporations play hardball with the little guys and *gasp!* are ultimately interested in making a profit for their shareholders. The documentary all but demonizes Anheuser-Busch and is only slightly more kind to Miller and Coors.

After watching Beer Wars, you'll feel motivated to branch out and pay a little more for some craft brews, but not for the right reasons. You certainly should give some microbreweries a shot at your loyalty, but fork your cash over because so many of the products have earned it! Beer Wars would like you to drink microbrews out of hatred for Anheuser-Busch/InBev and Miller-Coors or out of your indignation at the ""unfairness"" of cut-throat corporate America. What the documentary glosses over is the massive difference in quality and heritage between a craft brew and a mainstream beer from the really big brands. Rather than making purchasing decisions based on vague anger, people who love beer or who are learning to enjoy beer will do better to discriminate based on taste, artistry, craftsmanship, and the natural joy of a genuinely excellent beer.",1265932800,6,4557,4.897668393782383

From political clout in the form of huge donations to politicians to frivilious law suits against small brewers that are becoming successful and may become a threat. I found it startling the control that the 3 largest brewers (Anhheiser Busch, Coors and Miller) have over the markets.

3966350,5,B002Q7T79K,"So, here's the thing.  In America we like ""bland"" (with the exception of anything heavily salted).  Our whole country gravitates to the ""safe"" tastes that offer no real experimentation.  After prohibition all of our locally flavored beers died....and we were left with the homogenized swill that resulted in a watered-down concoction made to appeal to the women drinkers of the time.

Craft and microbreweries are now bringing back what was once a country filled with distinctively brewed flavors indigenous to their respective regions.  THIS is what drinking beer is about.  Thanks to a few pioneers in the industry from the 70's and 80's we can now all enjoy a beer brewed fresh, in your home town.  Big beers (Bud, Miller, Coors) are worried sick because this microbrewery revolution is evaporating their ""yellow fizzy beer"" stronghold in market share.

In an attempt to squash the ""small guys"", big beer companies are re-branding, re-badging, and re-packaging their products to make them appear to look like small batch brewery offerings.  If you're drinking ""Shock Top"" and think you're hip to the microbrewery underground.....think again.  This is just a last minute adjunct brew from Budweiser to try and cash in on the unsuspecting consumer looking to get their feet wet in the flavors of craft brewing.  The industry is FULL of this (*&^% and Anat did a GREAT job of exposing this in the film.

If you want to learn something today about beer and America, watch this movie.  If you're favorite beer is Bud, Miller, or Coors Light......and you'll never try anything else....well, then go back to your front porch and get a beer from the fridge and do something more productive like updating your Facebook status on your neighbors' wifi signal.",1361059200,2,1751,5.017301038062284

If you want to make a multi-national macrobrewery look bad to the kind of beer snobs that would dig this film, it's not hard to do. All you have to do is interview several microbrewers and hear them talking about their passion for beer. Then, you interview a few macrobrew employees and listen to them talking about sales figures, advertising, basically anything but quality beer. Somehow, this film blows a solid hour charming (if disjointed) footage that gives some insight into some passionate people and why they do what they do by getting intolerably heavy handed at the end. I do have even more respect for Sam Calagione than I did before I started the film, so that's something, but the film ends feeling more like it attacks the macros for being successful than for producing lousy beer. It takes an easily made case, ignores it, and instead attacks successful people for having the audacity to be successful. Do yourself a favor; watch the film, and stop after an hour. It's probably a solid 4 stars then. Don't sully a perfectly good hour by watching the obnoxious last 1/3 of the film, a 0 star subtraction/addition.",1357516800,4,1265,4.677130044843049
3966353,4,B002Q7T79K,"There is a lot that I already knew about the major breweries holding a monopoly of the beer that's sold across the country.  Just talk to any experienced bartender, bar owner or liquor store manager and they will tell you pretty much the same thing this documentary did:  Anheuser-Busch and Miller control who sells what beers and where they are displayed in stores.  A-B and Miller control 70% of the beer market and the smaller and better craft brewers are struggling.

So to gain the other 30 percent of the market, marketers for A-B try to buy up the smaller brewers, such as Rolling Rock.  As one brewer said, they buy up the smaller companies not so much for the beer, but for the brand recognition.

A few brands featured are Dogfish Beer and Yuengling, all eastern beers, but the story is pretty much the same across the country.  When Congress allowed craft beers to be sold in the late 1980s, that is when A-B, Miller and Coors started paying attention to the growing microbrewers that were springing up across the country.  The Big Three were all about cheap beer with cheap adjuncts (a fine word for fillers such as rice and corn) whereas the finer craftbeers are more about real beer made the old-fashioned way with pure ingredients.  This documentary featured one segment where several beer drinkers would mention their favorite beers but then couldn't tell one brand apart from the other during a taste test.  People drink the national brands not for taste but out of habit.

Although I could say that this documentary could go into more detail about the wars between the Big Two and the smaller brewers and less about the woman beer entrepeneur, the point is made.  Distributors are controlled by A-B and Miller so if the regional distributor doesn't want to carry the smaller craft beers, they can shut out the smaller brewers out quite easily.

I discovered craft beers over ten years ago when I lived in New Jersey and can never go back to the national brands.  The only time I buy Bud Lite is when I need a cheap fly attractant.  Bud Lite has so much added sugars in its mixture that flies are attracted to the beer, crawl inside the bottle or can, and drown.  You won't see as many flies be attracted to a high-quality craft beer as often.

So, enjoy this 90-minute documentary.  Open your mind to real beer.  Once you taste a real beer, it's hard to go back to that stale Bud.  You truly are what you drink.",1318464000,3,2429,4.565819861431871

It explores the struggles small brewers face and how large breweries are trying to suppress these small brewers using archaic legislation, distribution, and established influence.  While I feel that it can be slightly biased against big breweries at times, it gives an overall good impression of the state of the industry.

The film mainly focuses on Sam Calagione, the founder of Dogfish Head Brewery, and Rhonda Kallman, a woman trying to market a new type of beer and establish her company.  There are other stories throughout the movie, but these two are the main focus.

I would suggest this movie to anyone interested in craft beer and the beer industry as a whole.

8377536,4,B002Q7T79K,"Most people think of beer as a comforting beverage enjoyed after a long day at work. Beer is about relaxation, leisure, even fun. Beers are consumed after hours in social settings such as bars, restaurants, and hotels, places away from the daily work grind. And yet, people whose careers are inside the beer industry in America fight heated battles for market dominance. In other words, behind the veneer of friends and leisure lurks a tough and cut-throat business world, that of the pale lager industry. ""Beer Wars"" takes us behind the scenes into the often shrouded world of beverage production and marketing. One of the first things the documentary teaches at that what most people think of as ""plain beer"", such as bottled by Bud and Miller, is a kind of beer called ""pale lager"", sometimes called watered-down lager, which is the most flavorless and cheapest beer to produce. Most Americans think beer is just beer. The microbreweries came into existence in part to combat the notion of ""generic beer"", a.k.a. pale lager, as advertised by the big three beer producers.

The documentary shows how these battles for market share and market dominance are often fought on fields in which most consumers don't realize combat is taking place. A brand being placed at eye level in the refrigerator at a small market can mean improvement in sales while being placed on the bottom shelf away from consumer eyes could also be its death knell. Unless a consumer already knows what he or she desires, those brands which stand out are the ones often picked by buyers. The film incorporates interviews and brief histories of not only the large breweries but some of the smaller micro-breweries which began popping up in the 1980's and 1990's to combat the big corporations.

If there is anything the documentary demonstrates, it is that Anheiser-Busch, now Anheiser-Busch Inbev since the merger, doesn't only desire market dominance, which it has had in spades since the 1990's. They want complete market control, not unlike a dictator who desires every citizen to pledge complete unconditional loyalty. In one poignant scene, the micro-brewery Dogfish Head receives a letter from Anheiser-Busch's legal department stating one of their brands' names is too similar to a new Bud product, and they should desist or else face a lawsuit. Nevermind Dogfish's product came out ten years before Bud's.

Although I largely enjoyed the documentary, I felt there were a few holes. One of the most interesting aspects of the beer industry is the rise to dominance of the big three, Bud, Coors and Miller, which apparently rose to market supremacy beginning in the 1970's and climaxed in the mid-2000's. They are now under slight threat from the microbreweries who have been slowly gaining market share. However, the documentary doesn't thoroughly explain how the big three grew into these giant behemoths, except to say they bought up small breweries and engaged in fierce market advertising which ""forced"" consumers into buying their brands. Certainly, marketing has great influence, but I am skeptical of the idea that consumers were somehow forced to buy certain products. It does appear that many consumers were left with little variety until the rise of the micro-breweries beginning in the mid-1980's with SamAdams/Boston Beer Company, although Yuengling Brewery is the oldest surviving brewery doing business since the 19th century.

Other parts went a little long in the sentimental department, such as showing a day-in-the-life of some of the people running the small breweries. I wanted to see more about the actual beer wars and the competition and less of their kids, as cute as they were. I also wanted to hear a little more from bona fide beer connoisseurs, not just random people on the street, which was getting a little too much like a Michael Moore show. Also, there were going to be congressional hearings concerning the modus operandi of the brewing industry, and I wanted to hear more about what was at stake and whose side people were on.

Still, overall a good documentary about an industry which permeates most people's lives but isn't discussed very much. And that may be by design. The beer companies, particularly the big ones, don't want to divulge much of what goes on behind the scenes. While the microbreweries were eager to talk, then CEO of Anhauser-Busch August Busch IV appeared little interested in being interviewed. It is interesting that the people with the most power are often the ones least willing to appear on camera, as if they have something to hide. In this sense, this reminded me a little bit of Moore's ""Roger & Me"" in which Moore tries to get an interview with GM's CEO but to no avail.",1434672000,,4718,4.974651457541191
