8035002,1,B0002YLCN8,I did not realize this was to show someone how to have a princess party and not a movie about a princess party.  I ordered vol. 1 and 2 and both was not what I thought it was.  But I blame myself for not reading the description more closer. Wish I could send it back but already opened both of them!,1374019200,,299,3.8852459016393444
8035003,3,B0002YLCN8,"My daughter loves the disney princesses, I thought their would be a little footage with them on this DVD like maybe the princesses having a tea together but not on this DVD, it was very disappointing.",1245888000,5,200,4.583333333333333
8035004,3,B0002YLCN8,This is a fun enough video to keep a few little girls entertained for a while.  It's one that can always be passed along.,1201046400,,121,4.041666666666667
8035005,5,B0002YLCN8,"Our little 2-year-old princess has just discovered the Disney Princess collection...she calls them all her ""girls.""  This one is sweet.  The whole pajama party idea is great for bedtime.",1131062400,4,186,5.379310344827586
8035006,1,B0002YLCN8,"I have never written a review before, but this DVD was so bad that I wanted to warn other parents out there, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  As other reviews have stated, this is just a bunch of ""repurposed"" old Disney cartoons/shows.  The quality is terrible and there is nothing new here at all.  Shame on Disney for selling this very low quality product.",1116892800,14,350,4.523809523809524
8035007,1,B0002YLCN8,"My 3 year old daughter really likes the 2 Princess Stories DVDs, so she begged us to get the Princess Party with Sleeping Beauty. Well, after going through every single menu option, we still cannot find Sleeping Beauty anywhere on this DVD. My daughter was IN TEARS. Disney really misled us by putting Sleeping Beauty on the front cover. I'm going to try to return this.

I was expecting to see some craft vignettes with little girls making princess things or doing princess dances (like on the 2 Stories DVDs where they make bracelets and wreaths) but there was NOTHING.

I am very disappointed. I would like to give this 0 stars, but there is no option for that. I just hope I can return this piece of false advertising.",1111190400,15,722,4.546153846153846
8035008,5,B0002YLCN8,"I just turned 19 and am totally obsessed with Disney Princess! I got this DVD (and the Princess Party Volume 1) for my birthday and absolutly love both of them! There are so many awesome games and stories and the music videos are done so well I got teary eyed. WELL worth the $15! I used a few of the games for my birthday party and we all watched the music videos, and I'm 19, I can only imagine how much a 5 ot 6 year old would love it. I plan on saving these DVDs for when I one day have children of my own.",1110412800,2,510,3.8207547169811322
