7843688,3,6303331971,"We are great Spenser fans, both the books and the tv series, and we remembered the videos fondly. Unfortunately, the video did not hold up over time. They should have used the cast from the series. The whole thing seemed a little flat, a bit too pale.",1503187200,,251,4.361702127659575

7843693,4,6303331971,Good to remember old times. I used to watch every episode of this series. Wish there were more made. I should watch it again.,1369872000,,125,4.25
7843694,2,6303331971,"I bought this Spenser story and was looking forward to viewing it.  However the disk was poor and skipped about.  It''s my fault I didn't go through the trouble to send it back, but I always think that a new disk should not have imperfections.  So it's not the seller's fault but mine, that this gets a poor review.",1270425600,,315,4.305084745762712
7843695,1,6303331971,"Aaarrrggghhh.  The 80's series ""Spenser: For Hire"" was a treat.  Robert Urich was hunky and intellectual, tough and tender.  Avery Brooks was unmatchable as Hawk.  Barbara Williams did a workman-like job as Spenser's main squeeze, Susan.  But all that was in the original 80's series and, unfortunately, none of it shows up here.

How is it you can bring back Urich and Brooks and manage to make something as awful, poorly acted, and convoluted in story line as this and the other 90's made-for-TV movies based on the original Spenser series?  But they - whoever they are - managed it!

The late Bob Urich is still the same Spenser, but just not enough to salvage this mess.  And somehow they managed to diminish Hawk, both in time onscreen and in breadth of character - a real shame, as Brooks brought much to the original series.

My advice?  Wait for the release of the 80's series on DVD and don't waste your hard-earned bucks here.  Yet if you simply have to watch this one for old-times' sake, at least don't let it dim your memory of a great series...",1216080000,,1058,4.569148936170213
