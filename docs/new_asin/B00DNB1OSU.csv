5834591,5,B00DNB1OSU,"Beautiful and sensitive Movie about pre-teens set in France during
the Nazi ocupation, around 1944.
Made with Love, Humor and Patriotism.
I wish all France, should had reacted
this Way. THEN, WE WOULD LOVE FRANCE.
Otherwise, the Acting and the Story
is Excellent.  SEE IT.

5834592,3,B00DNB1OSU,A really emotionally pandering tv remake of an already-classic flick. Skip this one unless you're really into french melodramatic remakes.,1426636800,,138,5.95

5834595,4,B00DNB1OSU,"It is not often that one can recommend a drama about World War II that ne can recommend for middle school students as well as older teens and adults.  While there are many documentaries suitable for 12-14 year-olds on this subject--and especially a subject that touches on the Holocaust--there are few dramas that can provide both thoughtful insight as well as an interesting plot.  This feature film is a good way to introduce the subject of ""empathy"" as well as ""resistance"".  There is one warning, however, The two gangs of boys who wage their own kind of ""war"" shout insults at each other--with some insults referring to a male anatomical member.  Although I would not have minded my own young teens hearing those epithets, some parents might have second thoughts about the curse words.  The fact that the French is translated in very visible subtitles emphasizes the words.  BUt if this is not a worry to you...I highly recommend this remake of an earlier French film.",1402099200,3,973,4.831325301204819
5834596,1,B00DNB1OSU,I thought that I was ordering the Irish version that had been around for many years.  This is a french version of the same movie that is using the same film name as the Irish version!  Not a bad movie but not what I thought that I had ordered.,1398556800,3,243,3.938775510204082
5834597,5,B00DNB1OSU,This was an excellent movie. Very well done. I watched it with friends and we all enjoyed it very much!,1392940800,,103,4.2
5834598,5,B00DNB1OSU,"I loved this film and was amazed when I came to this site to see that so few people had seen it, and that it actually got some bad reviews.  This is one of the best films I've seen in a long time.  The story is wonderful, and is based on true accounts of real people.  The setting in rural France is beautiful and the cast is perfect.  Best of all are the child actors!  Your heart will be warmed as you watch this terrific film! (Don't be afraid to watch something in French---there are English subtitles---It's well worth it!)",1390003200,6,528,4.24
5834599,1,B00DNB1OSU,"Not sure actually how good the movie is, but it is in French. You only discover this after purchasing the movie because neither the trailer, nor the movie details shown beforehand indicate that French is the language of the movie.  The trailer includes a man describing the movie as it shows scenes, and he is speaking English.  Naturally you get the distinct impression the movie is in English.  Amazon was gracious enough to refund our money once we reported our experience which we appreciated.  We were disappointed to not be able to actually  enjoy the movie.  Thank you Amazon!",1382140800,3,583,4.838383838383838
5834600,3,B00DNB1OSU,"Its not as good as the Irish version, in fact it is like a different story.  The only thing that is anything like the Irish film is that they cut buttons off the rival gang's clothes.",1381708800,,183,4.083333333333333
5834601,5,B00DNB1OSU,"There was an older film of this same title, but it dealt with Irish schoolboys and had much the same plot. But this one I think is better because it shows a side of the World War (1939-1945) from a child's point of view.  Also, the title in French translates to ""The New War of the Buttons,"" possibly from the fact of the previous film of the same name.  As foreign language films go, this one has English subtitles that actually give you enough time to read them. My French is cursory at best, but I did detect the English translations to be slightly off, adding more words than were actually spoken but still maintaining the gist of the conversation.  The period clothing is perfect and none of the children had ever acted before which is very surprising by their performance.  Some of the scenes of the French countryside are breathtaking. This is a very delightful film and highly recommend for those who are weary of war movies bathed in blood and gore. Imdb website gave it only 5 stars, but I'd give it a 7.",1381104000,7,1014,4.435483870967742

8594702,2,B00DNB1OSU,Not what I wanted. French version. Have to read to watch. I was after an Irish version. I found it and have received it from you. Wish it had been more clear from start.,1525219200,,169,4.0

8594706,5,B00DNB1OSU,This is a great movie that I show to my French students.  The characters are relatable and the plot is a great introduction to teaching students about the Nazi occupation of France.,1480723200,,181,4.65625
8594707,5,B00DNB1OSU,Great movie. Very relevant to WWII. Really good for use with students learning French.,1461801600,,86,5.214285714285714
8594708,1,B00DNB1OSU,"i thought this movie was the original one, and after purchasing i found its some french remake version, so if your looking for the amazing awesome War of buttons thats setting is in ireland, then be cautious when buying because this movie sucked",1443139200,2,245,4.72093023255814
8594709,5,B00DNB1OSU,"Beautiful French countryside is the star of this recent film, along with charming French children who have never acted before and period clothing just right.  The setting is WWII and it is Vichy France, the part occupied by Nazi germany.  Schoolboys from neighboring towns right over their poaching rights and General turf, in imitation of the adult males at war.  They get pretty viscous and cut off a lot of buttons from shirts and short pants.  Naturally the wearer is humiliated as his pants fall down.  Plenty of crude insults pepper the air, and from the smallest of the boys, a cute little tag along kid, it is funny because it is such blatant imitation and braggadocio. A fortress of sorts is built for meetings and rivals set it on fire with flaming arrows.

A mayor's son turns traitor and is punished with a good belt thrashing, but clearly this is also an imitation of the boys' own fathers' behavior.

What shifts the focus is the arrival of a new girl, a smart city girl called Violette. The male dunce of the class has an instant crush on her.  She is supposedly from Brittany and recovering from poor health.  Naturally it turns out that she is a Jew and is living in hiding.  When this secret gets out through The boys fighting, the film deals with this part of the French behavior towards Jews at that time.  When all the girls skipping rope claim to the French policeman that their name is Violette, he is confounded and enraged.  I think this was a copy of the Danish people wearing thr yellow star in solidarity with their refugee Jews.  I wonder if it really would happen to girls of that age.

If you like period pieces, countryside romance between a handsome teacher and beautiful lingeriensaleswoman, French countryside in summer months, and the antics of boys who get in trouble when aping their elders, then this is the film for you.

Yes it is in French and so it should be.  If you read enough subtitles you might one day learn a foreign language the osmosis way as children do!

The study of antiquities and statues of Ancient Greek warriors is pretty funny.  Everything about war and Strategy interests these rival village boy gangs.

Notice how in broad daylight a French Jewish family is arrested and jailed away in a police car.  People watch.  Only the teacher intervenes since he knows the daughter from school.  That is how things were.  People wanted to avoid trouble.  And they still do!  Now they say, I don t want to get into a lawsuit or get some criminals going after me and my family!",1434067200,,2528,4.5768374164810695
8594710,4,B00DNB1OSU,"Although I enjoyed this version of War of the Buttons, anyone who has seen Yves Robert's 1962 take on Louis Pergaud's  classic novel, will much prefer the latter.  Robert's story, set in the French countryside before WWll is simply fun - preteen boys from two nearby villages defending their turf as their fathers had done before them.  There are no issues such as German occupation, a Jewish girl in hiding, an adult romance, French underground activity, and other subplots to complicate the story  Yes, the boys in the current version still battle for the honor of their towns, but the several subplots make this seem to me like a similar but different story -  good in its own way, but it's not Pergaud's!",1431907200,4,708,4.723577235772358
