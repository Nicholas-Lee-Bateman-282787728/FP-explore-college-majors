8123017,4,B000FII2SY,"Kultur has provided us with a good introduction to the work of the seminal figure in the creation of a great tradition of British portraiture and one of the best painters of his day. Apparently, a documentary for British television it follows the standard format for such things, a chronological sampling of his paintings with experts giving brief comments on each and brief comments on his life, influences and painting techniques. A narrator provides continuity. Save for the fact that there are multiple voices it is identical to any of the thousands of tours run by any museum with much to show. The pictures appear mostly from British collections and are well photographed, with nice closeups. All pretty much on the run, of course, but one does get some inkling of why he was so popular and influential. While the documentary, happily, points out that he did work in other genres, and work well, it is right to stress that in which he was most creative. A high point for me was being able to see his portrayal of his one-time boss's second wife. I have seen some of Rubens brilliant drawings of her, and many times have stood before the masterpiece of himself, with her and their child (amusingly on a leash). Only an artist of Van Dyke's
quality could have made her seem lovelier.
Not for the art expert but useful to the beginner in art of any age.",1292457600,,1356,4.630705394190872

Some people say Arsenio has the same relationship to Eddie Murphy.  Well, this documentary began by mentioning Reubens (sp?) as much as Van Dyck.  Van Dyck did grow into his own prominence eventually.

This work is very English, made by and for Brits.  There is gender diversity among the interviewees, but no Dutch national is seen here.  In terms of cheesy reenactments, they showed several scenes of a man portraying King Edward, but none or hardly of anyone portraying Van Dyck.

Van Dyck portrayed aristocrats and fancied himself one of his ilk.  This work involves the elite.  He was painting more than a century before Marx wrote.  Still, I was struck about how radically his oeuvre and vibe contrasted with a Georges Seurat or Diego Rivera.

The work analyzes things deeply, but I still thought some matters were left out.  The work notes that Van Dyck gave his subjects long hands to mark or adorn their class status.  It's odd because such a feature seems extraterrestrial now.  The work features and discusses a white noblewoman walking under an umbrella carried by a man of sub-Saharan African descent.  All the focus is on her and the brutha is ignored.  Nothing is said about slavery in Europe or if Van Dyck tried to portray the man sensitively.  We see a religious painting and it is clearly anachronistic.  Most of the figures are in robes and togas, but one is in knight's armor.  Like that existed in Biblical times!?

In fairness, this work is also highly British because the interviewees note that Van Dyck had a huge influence on later British painters.  He was given a knighthood in Britain, rather than the Netherlands, for instance.  This reminded me of how in French class we read plays by Ionesco, a Romanian, rather than French-born playwrights.  It's very true that foreigners can have huge influences on the citizens of other nations.",1202515200,,2003,4.823529411764706
