8365549,1,B002DNHPNC,"This is basically the first documentary (contained on the first disk), which was amazing, packaged with 2 disks of worthless interviews, especially on the 2nd disk!

If you already own the original documentary don't waste your money on this one!",1329782400,2,245,5.125
8365550,3,B002DNHPNC,"The first disc is excellent. The second and third just offer the narrator's autobiography and personal views on masonry and religion - mostly irrelevant, hardly interesting, and irksome in its clear advocation of mysticism and masonry. The time could have been better spent exploring the Book of Tephi, an Irish historical document where a queen of Ireland claims to be Jewish and to have brought the lapis exillis from Israel to Ireland around 550 B.C. The book is available free online at onread dot com but there's very few commentaries on it. Would love to see the producers of this DVD do another one on the Book of Tephi.",1329609600,,627,4.761467889908257
8365551,5,B002DNHPNC,"Louis Buff Parry speaks pure unabridged wisdom in this commentary on the Lapis Exillis. This DVD is extremely informational and overflowing with knowledge not known by the masses. His insight and code-breaking abilities make him very believable. I recommend this to anyone within the mysteries to gain knowledge and up-to-date data on Rosslyn Chapel and the Stone of Destiny as well as what the Grail is. Exhilerating.
