8488664,4,B005XLFB5A,"Two very early sound poverty row Westerns are featured here on this ALPHA dvd. Yes, crude and inept they are, almost as if someone were making these films with a few friends on a home-movie jaunt.

CANYON HAWKS (1930) looks best, clear image with good contrast for a public domain transfer. And best of all, Yak Canutt, former silent Western star and future badguy/stuntman gets his only starring role in a sound B-Western. No plot summation here, that's not important. You just need to know that both Yak and the print offered look just fine. And for those who know little about Yak, let me just add that this famous stuntman went on to 2nd-unit directing such great scenes as the chariot race in BEN HUR and the action sequences in many top films such as WHERE EAGLES DARE. Here you get to see an early Yak as a handsome leading man in a no-budget Western gem. He does himself well.

FLYING LARIETS (1931) looks shoddier, though I have yet to see a better print. It is watchable and very enjoyable in spite of the uncomfortable acting of both Sam Garrett (roping champion) and Wally Wales who became much more relaxed and assured of himself just a few years later when he went through a name change and became badguy Hal Taliaferro and menaced the likes of Roy Rogers and Gene Autry. One of my favorite Taliaferro roles is his henchman in the Roy Rogers film RIDING DOWN THE CANYON.

So what we have here is a pretty good Yak Canutt/Wally Wales double bill from the early 1930s. Both films are acceptable, CANYON HAWKS looking better, with less awkward performances, though FLYING LARIETS is the longer and more satisfying plotwise.

This is great historic B-Western stuff and should be seen by all Western movie fans if only to track the evolution of the genre. I love this stuff and recommend this dvd to all interested parties.",1351728000,,1832,4.610429447852761
