It looked like it was filmed at the same time as ""I Dream of Jeannie!"" or ""Bewitched.""  It has tons of snowflakes and what Brad Pitt's character calls cigarette burns in ""Fight Club.""  How cheap is that?

Some stuff was just so silly.  A cloaked man kills a woman with a knife but blood never flies from his knife onto the surrounding furniture.  The main character barely hides behind a tree, his enemies' car light flashes onto him, yet they don't notice him.  The main character is supposed to join a gym of champion contest winners, but the only muscular person is himself.  The women didn't look like bodybuilders; they looked like the typical TV types anyone sees everyday.

The film shows two topless women almost immediately.  So I thought, ""Watch that be the only type of nudity we see!""  Luckily, the main character does eventually reveal some portions.  Since he won a Mr. USA title, you wouldn't expect him to be shy, would you?",1161993600,,1109,4.683937823834197
