7920822,5,B00004RERG,Excellent!,1454457600,,10,10.0
7920823,3,B00004RERG,This is a set of 6 operas. Carmen is not looking good for me an Rigoletto has adult  content. Other than that I found it pretty good. I think that this kind of stuff has to be available in a libraries. And it is a shame that it is not.,1391212800,,235,3.7
7920824,5,B00004RERG,A great way to bring these classic to the kiddies and the uninitiated  one must begin somewhere-- why not here?,1302825600,,111,4.55
7920825,5,B00004RERG,"Product was exactly as described, showed up earlier than expected. Great purchasing experience, pleasure to do business with, I would HIGHLY recommend this seller to anyone. My 3 year old daughter now likes opera. Exceptionally difficult to find item, sold for a fair price. Many thanks for the above and beyond service.",1242777600,,320,5.173076923076923
7920826,5,B00004RERG,"The ""Rigoletto"" segment is amazing.  Ornate & historically accurate costumes and sets, magnificent lighting and cinematography, and eloquently expressed emotion - from puppets.  For general audiences, a PG-13 rating is appropriate, although our daughter viewed and loved it at 9.
The abridgement streamlines the convoluted plot into a form more easily digested by younger viewers, and possibly most modern audiences as well.  The father loves his daughter, the daughter feels ashamed, the bad guy is, was, and remains a bad guy.
When they're older, you can talk about the complex relationships between love and shame, parent and child, men and women, joy and suffering.",1199145600,,669,5.413461538461538
7920827,3,B00004RERG,"Simple put, I have seen most of these Operas in one iteration or another. I actually bought it for my daughters (3 and 5) after seeing an excerpt of ""Barber of Seville"" on a cable station. My wife and I love the ballet and Opera and want our children to do the same.
The stop action puppeteering on ""BoS"" is amazing and suitable for little ones, who might appreciate the arts. That being said, the rest of the Operas are questionable (for little eyes). Since the girls have seen ""Carmen"", and love it, it seemed digestible; with ""The Magic Flute"" a close third (very ""Yellow Submarine-ish"" and a little scary, like most good opera). The other 3 are confusing and dark and I will not show them until they are older (say 10 or so). Opera's need more exposure to younger viewers and this is a fair start. I wouldn't recommend for anyone who's looking to enrich little minds...they might have nightmares. If anyone knows of an Opera compilation for little ones, pass it on!",1066694400,11,969,4.542857142857143
7920828,5,B00004RERG,"Operavox is a series of six animated operas- Verdi's ""Rigoletto"", Bizet's ""Carmen"", Rossini's ""The Barber of Seville"", Wagner's ""Rhinegold"", Mozart's ""The Magic Flute"" and Puccini's ""Turandot"". Each of the operas has been adapted into half-hour animations- each one in  a different style and translated into English, to make the story easier to follow.
  Even as a teenager with a keen interest in music, I find that Operas are too long and too involved to take much interest in; however, Operavox was fantastic. It wasn't too long, it contained all the main points in the story, and it was interesting to the eye.
  I would describe Operavox as ""Opera for beginners"". It's perfect for anybody studying Opera in music, anybody who cannot sit through hours of Music, or even just for the mildly curious. The only thing that comes a disappointment is that there were only six of them made.",1054598400,10,887,4.926174496644295
7920829,5,B00004RERG,"I know that lots of people where disappointed with these 30 minute cartoon versions of 3 hour operas, but I guess I just loved 'em.
I'm 13 and for years I have been shoved into an image of opera as uptight garbage for people with a strange taste for boredom, but while searching thru the DVD section at my library, I found OperaVox and my mind just opened up to opera. I discovered operas to have exciting storylines, beautiful characters, and music that is much more than a bunch of Italian gobbledygook.
Okay, so they where in English and didn't fully express the grandeur of opera, but for young people and those who find opera to be a foreign mess not to be touched upon by the average person, it can inspire further exploration and appreciation of opera.
I have tickets to see Turandot (with real people, nice seats, supertitles...) and I hope to see more in the future. It's all thanks to OperaVox.
I recommend OperaVox to anyone who thinks opera is boring. They are about to be proven wrong.
I must warn you that you should not show Rigoletto to too young of people. Naked puppets can be a little scary.",1022889600,17,1110,4.472906403940887
7920830,2,B00004RERG,"I had eagerly anticipated this disc, but was greatly disappointed in the quality of the sound and the animation.  Each of the segments was animated in a different style, and some of them worked OK but some did not work well at all.  The Rigoletto, for example, was entertaining and imaginative, but the Magic Flute was disorganized and the story line was almost missing.  The Carmen was probably the best of the bunch and the Turandot was probably overall the worst--bad, in fact.
The sound was disappointing because the balance was off-the orchestra sometimes overpowered the singers.  The singers were generally quite good.  The singers were sometimes hard to understand, and the disc would have been better with subtitles, even though all the singing was in English.  I love good animation and opera but this just wasn't it.",1022544000,14,827,4.956521739130435
7920831,3,B00004RERG,"Operavox is a series of six opera performances with animated action.  The operas are sung in English.  Each opera is abbreviated to 1/2 hour long.  Some of these operas ""rock"", but others are mediocre at  best.
The highlights: The Magic Flute is awesome, with good singing and  imaginative animation.  Turandot is wonderful, with the great Jane Eaglen  singing the title role, and very good animation.  I was disappointed with  ""The Rhinegold"" (Das Rheingold) because while the animation is  top notch, the singing and English translation was very, very mediocre.  Alberich, in particular was extremely disappointing (if they can get  superstars like Eaglen to sing in Turandot, why can't they afford a good  cast for Rhinegold?)  However, Wagner fans should still see the video, for  it's dynamic ""Lord of the Rings"" reading of Rhinegold. The  Rigoletto performance was disturbing in terms of visuals, and I didn't  watch this one all the way through.  The other operas represented are  ""Carmen"" and ""The Barber of Serville"".
Some of the  animations are quite violent, and not suitable for children.  In  particular, The Rhinegold and Rigoletto (and maybe Carmen) are more adult  oriented.",957139200,13,1190,5.212765957446808
