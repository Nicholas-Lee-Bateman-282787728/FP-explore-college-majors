785743,4,6304132344,"Unwilling to rest on the laurels of the very successful pilot show, the creative staff came up with this exciting and suspenseful story.  Actually filmed third in the sequence of episodes this was broadcast prior to 'A Man Alone'; sharp viewers will notice some minor differences in the makeup of both Odo and Kira between these two episodes but it's of little consequence.  'Past Prologue' was one of the standout shows of the DS9 inaugural season and it introduced some key elements that would be returned to in later shows and fleshed out more.
The DS9 command center detects a Cardassian warship chasing a Bajoran scout ship.  The lone passenger of the Bajoran craft is beamed aboard when his ship begins to break up; he turns out to be a Bajoran named Tahna, a former comrade in arms of Major Kira and he immediately requests asylum.  When questioned he proclaims he is no longer a member of a notorious Bajoran terrorist faction Kohn-Ma and that the Cardassians have no right to pursue him.  Sisko agrees to temporarily postpone a decision on the matter until he can gather more information.  In the meantime...tension between Sisko and Kira reaches a critical point; two more Kohn-Ma members seek asylum at the station; Bashir meets the only Cardassian still a permanent resident on DS9; and two Klingon renegades stop by the station for a 'visit'.  All these events will seamlessly intersect in the finale with Kira facing a tough decision choosing her loyalties.
Rarely does a new series achieve back-to-back hits right from the beginning, but ST: DS9 manages it with panache.  Featuring a strong storyline 'Past Prologue' is notable for introducing the Cardassian, Garak, who makes an unlikely living as a tailor with a shop on the Promenade and played brilliantly by Andrew Robinson.  Also the popular Klingon sisters Lursa and B'Etor from ST: TNG episodes (and one movie) make an appearance here as well.  This trio of aliens is incorporated into the script perfectly; both separate parties figure into the story prominently and are used effectively.  We also get to see that Odo and Kira have a close relationship; when she wrestles with the burdens of her new duties and her desires to help out her former comrade, she turns to Odo for friendly advice.  In direct contrast to this is the tone of the conversations between Kira and Sisko who are beginning their assignment on separate sides of the fence; this tension between the two would be returned to several more times in future first season episodes.
A final note: the Starfleet admiral that Kira speaks to on a desktop monitor is played by Susan Bay, wife of Leonard Nimoy - someone who needs no introduction to any Trekkie.  She would return to play the same role (Admiral Rollman) in the second season show 'Whispers'.",1045353600,,2790,4.860759493670886
785744,3,6304132344,"Oh, just shoot Tahna Los in the first 5 minutes of this episode and put me out of my misery...!
I can sum up the episode in one word, if I must. Cranky. This is a cranky little episode, surrounding the actions of an annoying Bajoran character, Tahna Los.
Here's the plot. Kira meets up with one of her old terrorist friends, Tahna Los, who is seeking political asylum on DS9. The Cardassians chasing him for crimes against Cardassia want him back. Sisko refuses. Cardassian gets cranky. Kira thinks Sisko is not supporting Bajoran causes by hesitating to give assylum. Kira gets cranky.  Kira goes over Sisko's head to Starfleet Command, and pulls an Admiral out of a staff meeting. Admiral gets cranky. Admiral complains to Sisko. Sisko gets cranky. Meanwhile, Tahna Los tells Kira she's sold out to the Federation. Kira gets cranky. Klingon chicks show up armed on the promenade. Odo gets cranky. Klingon chicks try to do business with Tahna. Garak gets suspicious... but not cranky. Tahna tries to blow up a big bomb. Everyone gets cranky.
Just for laughs and giggles, I sat through the whole episode. I got cranky...
In all honesty, I did give this episode 3 stars. But that's mainly because of the wonderful introduction of our favorite Cardassian character, the ""plain and simple"" tailor, Mr. Garak. ""No, not Mr. Garak... just plain, simple Garak...""  And it was worth the 40 minutes of painful acting and drawn out plot line just to see the looks on Julian Bashir's face as his new Cardassian playmate breaks the good doctor into the spy game.
I was also happy to see Lursa and B'Etor, the Klingon sisters from the House of Duras, show their pretty faces in the Trek universe once again. *They're just SOOO delicate and feminine...!* But, I hate to say it... they seemed to be there not on their own merit, but as a way to give the Trek series legitimacy in its early days.
For anyone interested in learning about Garak, this is unfortunately an important episode to see. History is important, after all, and it does set up the whole Garak/Bashir/Lunch at the Replimat theme that shows its wonderful head throughout the run of the show.  And it does have a few great moments... like where Garak tries to sell lingerie to B'Etor and Lursa. *SILKY!* Or where garak is sitting alone at Quark's, secretly watching the klingon chicks... *hubba hubba, Elim!*  Or watching Garak's first attempts to seduce the innocent Dr Bashir into establishing their 7 year long lunchtime friendship... This is classic Garak. Who wouldn't love it?
It is also funny to look back at one of the first episodes of DS9. The acting seemed blase, and the story line was predictable at best, boring at worst. DS9 turned out to be an excellent show... but after viewing this episode, I was amazed how the show ever made it past the first season.
Had Gul Danar -- the Cardassian chasing Tahna Los in the first 10 minutes -- been a better shot, the whole episode would have been much less painful. Maybe not for Tahna Los.. but certainly for me...",970444800,3,3022,4.685499058380414

Hey dummies for future reference, a Star Trek series must actually has a starship. I could only watch maybe ten episodes and found myself back in the day... not turing in which is the first time ever.

Best Series, Star Trek Voyager and a very close second and could have been first, Enterprise and yes... Generations was good but does not hold up as well in retrospect. For campy humor etc. the first series was tops. Janeway and Picard are the best captains,  Archer is too very good but it is the group  that made the story of how the Federation came to be... so good.",1484092800,,808,4.373333333333333

786308,5,6304132344,"Season 4 is where DS9 really begins firing on all cylinders. The multiple episode story arcs that focus on characters instead of techno-bable really make this Star Trek different from all of the others. If you enjoy watching characters develop, watching how interactions between characters develop, and how it impacts the story lines, DS9 is for you.

The other thing I really like about DS9 is that the show seems more real. The interplay between characters (including poking fun jokingly at each other) and the subtle humor is very reminiscent of what you probably do yourself at work. The result is the characters become more believable, and thus you care about them more.

Finally, this season has my favorite episode of all the Star Trek franchises - The Visitor. If you are a parent or the adult child of a parent, you can feel the deep pain and longing between Ben Sisko (the father) and Jake Sisko (the son). It is an episode that can stand on its own, and if you are looking for an episode to decide if this is a series you want to invest some time in watching, then watch the Visitor.

Next Generation was like ""Wagon Train""  Deep Space 9 was like ""Gunsmoke""  Voyager is different more like the "" The Fugitive""

DS9 is my favorite because I love the cast and the multiple story lines.  Seeing Avery grow into Ben Sisko was believable.  Nana Visitor who played Major Kira, evolved into Major Hottie as far as I'm concerned.  Terry Ferrel played a passable Dax.  I love O'Brain in his evolution from a transporter chief to Chief of Operations.  Seems Odo was the random element that added spice to stories. Worf was kind of like a straightman, a little stiff but his sarcasm was enjoyable.  Dr Bashir was too arrogant in the beginning, but as he got older, the humanity came out more.  Quark gave the show more flavor, seeing the audacity about profit made it more interesting.

The story lines  improved as the show progressed.  By season 4 things started to unfold.  Season 6 is my favorite, episode 21 I believe ""his way"" is my favcuz Odo finally gets what he wants.

I believe it's important to watch all the Star Trek series in order, seeing the evolution of the Star Trek saga is logical as Mr Spock would say",1474070400,4,1352,4.61344537815126

In this season, Lieutenant Worf joins the DS9 crew, and I will admit it: it is great to see him on the station and not just on the Enterprise. Worf of course continues to wrestle with his past and struggle with an internal conflict. You can't help but feel for the guy. I also like how they further explore the chemistry between Chief O'Brien and Doctor Bashir; like in the episode where O'Brien is held prisoner and he says his inmate from the prison everywhere. The writers of that episode lose no time in showing how horrible it feels to know you are capable of doing something unforgivably horrible, and how traumatizing it can be when you cannot live with yourself, knowing you did it. Another episode I really like is ""Little Green Men,"" where Quark, Rom, and Nog accidentally travel back to the 1950s. The highlight of this episode is when Quark comments on mankind's worst behavior and his nature to leap before he looks. You know things are bad when Quark starts making sense, and then all you can do is laugh. A third episode to point out is kind of a downer when Odo, my favorite character by the way, loses his powers. The fourth episode I had/have to like is ""Starship Down,"" because Major Kira for the first time comes to respect and appreciate Sisko as the Emissary as well as a bit more than just her commanding officer. My only complaint is that the season four opener does not play properly. I don't know how some DVD box sets do that, but it's a crying shame. Still, the series DS9 just keeps getting better. Can't wait for season five.",1462665600,2,1854,5.003236245954692
786617,5,6304132344,"This is where the series really hit it's stride. There are duds yes but this got some balls rolling.

The Klingon & Cardassian War was a nice sample taste of the war to come. The Quickening was perhaps one of my favorite episodes of the series. It provided a rather non-rosy ending to what would have been a normal happy ended. Instead of a saved people, it was an ending where there was hope.

They introduced Weyoun. Need I say more.

Mirror Universe episode? Check!

Odo having a great crisis of his own.

The threat at home episodes were awesome. A little bit of flash back to cold war warfare and politics.

The stage is set for Season 5 and all the way upto the end.",1462579200,,672,4.2936507936507935
786618,4,6304132344,"Overall, the story lines for Season 4 are very good.  The addition of Michael Dorn (as Commander Worf) was a very good move.  I was an avid viewer of ST:TNG and his role on that show was good.  I was glad to see both him and Colm Meaney (as Chief O'Brien) made the move over to DS9.  The shows this season are though provoking and well produced.  My only gripe with viewing the episodes is the shortening of the closing credits.  I have been watching these episodes on Roku and starting with Season 4, the closing credits are being cut short, sometimes by almost 30 to 40 seconds.  I would enjoy viewing the entire episode.

786661,5,6304132344,"By now the series had hit its stride and I can honestly say it had reached a level just behind that of Star Trek The Next Generation. There were some flaws in the series. why, for instance did Worf and O'Brien not continue the poker games that they had enjoyed on Enterprise? It's logical to assume that they would have dragged Dax and perhaps even Quark into a game or two. The series seemed to want to distance itself too much from The Next Generation in that regard.

The addition of Worf to DS9 was controversial. one reviewer criticized the continuity factor. I feel it was done to boost sagging ratings. either way it only helped liven the show and it made things more interesting. Worf got a promotion to Executive Officer of a starship; something he'd not have received had he remained on the Enterprise. But it was great that Worf still returned for the movie reunions. however stretched the plausibility might have been in several instances.

The Way of the Warrior continued the Worf/Federation/Klingon Empire choices the character has always had to make. Personally I was upset to see that the Khitomer Accords were dissolved as a result of the Cardassian/Klingon war. Why would the Federation care about the Cardassians? And more to the point why would the Federation continue to support the Cardassians over the Maquis? Former Federation colonies fighting against brutal Cardassian overlords? They call them ""terrorists""? A terrorist is not someone fighting for their homeland; a homeland brutally taken from them by a repressive government. More to the point, how could the Cardassians even hold on to those colonies with the Klingon Empire hitting them with everything they had? It makes little sense. If anything the Maquis would have created an alliance with the Klingons in order to keep their colonies intact while providing Klingons safe haven/bases for their Birds of Prey.

Their were great episodes this season. I'll name one or two per disc. The Way of the Warrior for Disc #1; Starship Down for Disc #2; Disc #3 has four great episodes. The Sword of Kahless; Our Man Bashir; Homefront; Paradise Lost. Disc #4 Crossfire and Sons of Mogh. Disc #5 Accession and Rules of Engagement. Disc #6 The Quickening. Disc #7 Broken Link.

I will criticize Sons of Mogh the most severely. The episode retcons Klingon society. In previous episodes suicide was an option for Klingons. This episode seems to go back on those ideas. Unlike Picard, Sisko is not accepting of Klingon culture. Captain Picard was much more understanding. but despite this I do not think that Worf would have done the deed on Deep Space Nine. He would have killed his brother on/in another world. Probably a Klingon colony where it would not have been given a second glance. This is a good episode but it is set up only to showcase how ""life"" is supposedly important. Unfortunately that is a typically ignorant American way to look at things. I don't subscribe to it nor would most people in the situation that Kurn found himself to be in. I don't like how Worf supposedly ""saw the light"" and realized how the ceremony was ""murder."" The writers of the story should have known better and I feel they dropped the ball on that one.

I give this DVD a Four and a half Star rating rounded up to Five Stars. Buy it and you will mostly enjoy it. I'm the 402nd person to review this DVD.

787087,1,6304132344,"I am not a fan of Deep Space Nine, I don't think it has good characters or believable races. People seem to play too much even in the face of war, they also don't train enough. They should have a lot more scenes of the performing battle training etc. The engage in childish gossip too often even when facing war and its time to toughen up. Deep Space Nine did have one of the greatest Star Trek episodes though ""The Visitor"" was an outstanding show. I did like the ship ""The Defiant"" better than the Enterprise in the Next Generation. The Enterprise was too much, no Government would make a ship that luxurious unless everybody living on Federation Planets were living like Billionaires. Which they aren't, just pay attention when they visit planets. The Jem'hadar are too much, genetically engineering strength that much is goofy. If they wanted strength that great they should have given these soldiers special suits that through physical means greatly enhanced it such as was done in Starship Troopers(The book, not the Film). In ""The Original Series"" Dr. McCoy states that Khan (from The Wrath of Khan) was 4 times stronger than a man. But in the TV episode looked more like he was twice a strong. Four time as strong as an average man is the approximate strength of a Professional Heavy Weight Power Lifter. Dr. McCoy was wildly passionate and I always attributed this to be an exaggeration. Although in the subsequent movies they try to show them to be far stronger especially the last one. The last one would need to make that 25 times stronger anyway. To crush somebodies skull a person would need the strength of a machine press. Take two people of the same size and the same physical condition, one genetically enhanced, you could plausibly in a story make him 2 times, maybe even three times stronger. But this four times and more stronger is goofy, unless its in Comic Books. Now in reality you can have two guy of the same basic size with one being twice as strong, but that's because he is in better shape. The point I am trying to make is that Deep Space Nine just goes too far with everything.",1437696000,,2109,4.596816976127321

Next Generation was so good I still watch them over and over. Voyager did a good job of continuing that style of Star Trek. Deep Space 9 brought in some new and edgy angles to the writing, 5 stars.

Some very memorable episodes, with creative plots, not just warmed over remakes",1430524800,,416,5.836065573770492
787219,5,6304132344,"  

Season 4 gets real on Deep Space 9. The tension with the Dominion starts heating up. The tense alliance with the Klingon Empire starts to get legs under it. The Cardasians develop more depth and are seen as more than a war loving race of empire builders.

Worf shows up for a new duty post on DS9 now than the Enterprise D has crashed into a planet during Star Trek:Generations. Sisko is finally bald and looks large and in charge because of it. Quark is......just awesome.

As for the storytelling its probably the best overall story arc in the Trek franchise. While there are a lot of single episode stories, there is an overall story arc that spans the entire series. It's interesting. It's well written. Well made. And it's just good sci-fi and story telling in general. The series long story arc takes a lot of twists and turns but it deals with inter stellar politics and power struggles that the other Trek series only elude to. (Yeah, Captain Picard has a fair amount of diplomatic and military run ins with the Romulans and Klingons, but on Deep Space Nine the series delves much deeper into the politics or all that, and introduces a few new races from the other side of the galaxy into the mix)

If you like the Star Trek franchise, you have to try Deep Space Nine.",1430438400,,1280,4.491379310344827

Watch the prior seasons to follow the story but don't give up before season 4. Only negative is that the ""O'Brien must suffer"" plotline becomes more pronounced and since this is my second time through I know there will be more to come.

From the first episode ""Emissary"" to it's last ""What You Leave Behind"", you go along with some truly broken people and see them grow beyond their frailty. The sense of duty, honor, and profound spiritual faith all play a part in the growth of each character.

Shortly after the destruction of the Enterprise D, Commander Worf joins the cast at the beginning of season 4. He fits right in with the cast and crew of outcasts. He might very well be the most honorable character in the Star Trek universe.",1408924800,,702,4.571428571428571

The writing, acting and storylines are just as good as ST: TNG and Voyager and I particularly appreciate how DS9 was handed the baton, so to speak from, TNG.  Each episode within each season builds from the previous ones and continues to build depth into each character as well as getting their backstories woven in here and there.  The one thing in particular that stands out is the type of father Captain Sisko is.  He is gentle, loving, a good moral role model and actually shows affection towards his son on a regular basis; ie. kissing him on the forehead or cheek, hugging and patting him on the back.  Sisko is a single father, runs the station, is a chef and has a very positive attitude toward life and loves to laugh.

The characters work well together and the visuals take a sizeable leap up from the previous outings.

The video quality is much better than before. You'll notice it immediately as I did. I used to record the show on VHS tapes while I was finishing-up my Tae Kwon Do classes and all I remembered was a fairly fuzzy picture. All these years later I got the dvd's and the first 3 seasons were very nice to look at and then came season 4. The picture quality sharpened up considerably.

788720,2,6304132344,"The secondary plot is worth two stars, the primary ends up being worth nothing.

The secondary plot line of Worf vs. Odo was good to help highlight the difference between starship and starbase operations, especially in a mixed up place like DS9.

The primary plot line was actually a fairly good setup and tension.  Given the way it turned out, the best was the ending where the Jem'Hadar commander tells O'Brien to explain the situation to Bashir.  That is all that saved it from being a negative rating.

The big problem: That O'Brien fails utterly to grasp the situation in the episode while Bashir was 100% correct.

The bigger problem:  Despite the fact that O'Brien should know from previous episodes exactly what is at stake with the Jem'Hadar's addiction, he ignores Bashir and then destroys Bashir's research when Bashir was close to solving the problem of Jem'Hadar addiction.  O'Brien's fears of berserker Jem'Hadar was specious considering that ""uncontrolled"" Jem'Hadar would be far, far less of a threat than addicted Jem'Hadar integrated into the Dominion war machine.  Real thin plot writing there.

The biggest problem: The lovey dovey, let's all kiss and make up after a few days mad ending between the officer and NCO.  If Bashir was not going to bring O'Brien up on charges, then he needed to request an immediate transfer and if it was not granted, resign his commission.  A: his authority was denied by his inferior, B: his lawful orders were disobeyed by his inferior, C: all just because this NCO became ""stupid"" all of a sudden and wanted to ""save the officer"".

Especially bad since Doctor Bashir has repeatedly had no problem asserting his authority repeatedly in situations during earlier episodes.  I do admit that I could see stretching the Bashir character to cover the transfer/resign option  without preferring charges given the need for O'Brien's skills on DS9.

I'll come back and change this rating if the next few episodes give some time to actually resolving this issue, but knowing ""classic Star Trek"", including DS9, this is a ""throw away"" that will never be brought up again.",1330387200,5,2115,4.965909090909091

Star Trek is about pushing the limits of Science Fiction while giving the viewer's Gene's Humanitarian view of what our potential can be.

788906,1,6304132344,"This review is for practicing Christian viewers.

As a DS 9 viewer, the Trill have always stricken me as an analogy to the human psychosis of 'gender identity disorder', at least that appears to be what DS 9 writers have in mind when drawing parallels to our own present day society, given the trill tendency to transfer symbiants to male AND female hosts.

In this episode we are confronted with a rejection of the Abrahamic (Jewish, Christian, Muslim) morality that regards homosexual acts as sinful. About two thirds into the episode we are subjected to a kiss that is designed by the writers of this episode to accomplish an ideological goal. We are baited into feeling sympathy for the Jadzia character, which, of course, as emotive people, we do...but that sympathy is intended to force us to reconsider our moral ethos.

It won't work. It's a logical fallacy; another attempt by liberal writers to make us think solely in emotional terms; to make us think with our hearts, and ignore our brains, which would remind us to maintain our moral/intellectual consistency. Mere sympathy is not sufficient ground to alter one's moral code. I feel sympathy for those who do me wrong but that sympathy doesn't cause me to deny that those individuals have done anything wrong. Christian viewers be wary.",1327190400,3,1299,4.8954545454545455
788907,3,6304132344,"*Spoiler*

Another episode with the excellent acting and powerful dramatic abilities that I've come to expect from Avery Brooks, though one that ultimately strains my ethics once again. The genius of this episode is in its plying of our empathic emotional strings. Everyone wants the boy and his father to get a second chance. It's wrong that a man as unselfish and honorable as Capt. Sisko should be wrenched from his son's life. However, this episode raises a few disturbing questions about the worth of every individual human life.

In Sisko's parting rebuke of his dying, aged son, he was right. If you believe in the inestimable worth of every human being, the quest to reunite his father with the past did not and could not have justified the taking of his own life. His father was visibly disturbed by his son's action, he knew that his son should have let go and lived his life; to see Jake come to that end broke Sisko's heart.",1327104000,,936,4.632530120481928
788908,5,6304132344,"Star Trek Deep Space Nine really picks up here. First there is the new introduction. When DS9 is seen from a distance, three ships are seen leaving the station and when the station is shown up close, ships and personnel are seen around the station. Then there is the addition of Lt. Commander Worf. That really added to the series and its sad in a way because the Enterprise was destroyed (See Star Trek Generations). That gets mentioned by Worf at the beginning of Season 4. Also during this series relations between the Federation and the Klingon empire end and planet Earth is threatened by the Dominion. Shapeshifters have invaded Earth. And the final episode would end Season 4 with Odo becoming a solid (human being). This may be the season that saved Deep Space Nine.

788909,4,6304132344,My family used to watch this show all the time.  We missed Season 4 and 5 because we moved to an area where the show wasn't aired.  This is one show the kids love watching.  The only complaint I have is the show where Dax falls in love with an old female acquaintance.  The show just seemed like DS9 pandering to a specific group's agenda.  DS9 is still easily the best Star Trek franchise even though this season wasn't as strong as some of the others.,1325203200,,453,4.22093023255814
788910,5,6304132344,"Season four starts out swinging and hits a home run. Bringing in a heavy hitter from STNG, Lt. Commander Worf, DS9 shakes up the line up. In Season four DS9 begins its assent to a different kind of Star Trek, where they are able to form a richly detailed story arch. Seasons 1-2 established the cast within the safety of standard Star Trek methodology. Season 3 polishes each member of the station's character and introduces the Dominion. When season 4 starts we know the team, now we get to sit back and watch what they can do with some awesome good story. Conflict makes drama, and we have galactic conflict to push this drama along.

All Star Trek Franchise shows have a steady, and slow episodic pace. And this was even more true in the 90's, as media was evolving into an instant gratification machine, but it hadn't gotten there yet. Some of the season 1-3 episodes are paced so slow that they can be downright laborious to watch. All that changes now, season four starts out sprinting and keeps going. Each episode is well-crafted and paced at a higher tempo.

The season premier ""The Way of the Warrior"" is a fantastic feature length episode, other episodic highlights include: Episode 2, ""The Visitor"" is emotionally rich. Episode 6 ""Little Green Men"", was a humorous departure. Episode 9 ""Our Man Bashir"" was a fun James Bond kind of romp in the hollosuites. Episode 18 ""Hard Time"" takes a dark turn for O'Brien. Episode 21 ""For the Cause"" complicates Sisko's relationship with Kassidy Yates. Other episodes add depth and character to favorite regulars, such as Dukat and Garrick. As well as furthering the complicated relationship between the alpha-quadrant and the gamma-quadrant.

All in all Season four marks the differentiation point where Deep Space Nine begins its journey as the the most unique and literate of the Star Trek Franchise. This season builds the foundation that allows DS9 to grow beyond canned space-ship episodes into a truly magnificent story that grows more delightful right up until its spectacular conclusion.",1324425600,5,2046,4.907514450867052

788965,5,6304132344,"By now, we're beginning the fourth year of the series, and let's recap what has already been established during the season premiere, ""The Way of the Warrior.""  The Deep Space Nine station has spent several months fortifying its weapons & defense systems against a Dominion invasion from the Gamma Quadrant, as well as honing its practice of blood screenings & phaser sweeps to expose changeling infiltrators.  Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) has first begun a relationship with freighter captain Kassidy Yates (Penny Johnson), as well as shaved his head (an appearance which Avery had adopted before starring on DS9).  Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) has been promoted to Lieutenant Commander and is presently trying to prod Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) into using a the olosuite which she's been resisting because of its ""unreality.""  Quark (Armin Shimmerman) is increasingly irritated by the increased security on the promenade, and Odo (Rene Auberjonois) is synchronously critical of the crew's ""sluggish"" response time during anti-changeling drills.

Then, the unexpected happens.  The Klingons arrive, an entire .armada, commanded by a general named Martok (J. G. Hertzler).  They take up a position on the station and begin harassing its occupants.  The Cardassian tailor Garak (Andrew J. Robinson) is bullied, Odo is barked at for being a shapeshifter, and Kassidy's ship is one of several being searched for changeling infiltrators.  When the soldier responsible for harassing Kassidy turns up dead, Ben Sisko requests for Lieutenant Commander Worf (Michael Dorn), the only Klingon Starfleet officer to present himself on DS9 to assist with getting to the heart of the Klingons' antics.  Through a touch of skullduggery, Worf learns that his people are planning to attack Cardassia, based on apocryphal leads that their new civilian government's rise to power was engineered by changelings.  The Federation crew is caught between a rock and a hard place, not wanting to violate the Khitomer Accords or their new treaty with Cardassia.  While getting Garak to measure him for new clothes, Sisko slips him information to be forwarded to Cardassia as a warning, after which the Klingons launch the Cardassian invasion and formally withdraw from the Khitomer Accords, ending their peace with the Federation.  The DS9 crew is dispatched on the USS Defiant to assist with the safe evacuation of the Cardassian civilian government (the Detapa Council), even though it means having to pick their way through hundreds of attacking Klingon ships to reach them.  Upon their return to the station with the Detapa Council, the crew must instantly ready themselves for the Klingons' assault.  The station is damaged, though not irreparably, and Sisko convinces Chancellor Gowron (Robert O'Reilly) to stand down before an oncoming fleet of Federation starships arrives to match them.  In the aftermath, Worf must decide between a resignation from Starfleet and accepting a post as DS9's strategic operations officer.  After a talk with Sisko, Worf chooses to accept the station post.

In the wake of the Klingons' invasion of Cardassia and the suspension of their peace with the Federation, the Station personnel do the best they can to move along.  In the immediate interim, Major Kira journeys with Gul Dukat  Marc Alaimo) to find a lost transport ship carrying people they both knew, and the major learns that Dukat had previously taken a Bajoran Mistress named Tora Naprem and fathered with her a daughter named Tora Ziyal (portrayed here by Ciya Batten, later by Tracy Middendorf and Melanie Smith).  Jadzia Dax is briefly united with a Trill named Lenaraa Kahn, with whom she'd had a previous relationship (both symbionts in different hosts); this moment brings to light a law that joined Trills cannot resurrect relationships held by antecedent hosts.  Nog (Aron Eisenberg) leaves the station to become the first Ferengi enrolled in Starfleet Academy, and the journey to earth (provided by Quark and Nog's father Rom (Max Grodenchick) is not without its adventures.  In the following month, Dax' old friend Kor (John Colicos) reveals the location of a legendary weapon which could possibly unite the Klingon Empire.  A radical Cardassian faction, the True Way causes a systematic disruption which lands Sisko, Kira, Dax, Worf and Chief Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) in Dr. Julian Bahier's (Alexander Siddig) secret agent program on the holosuite.  When Sisko, Odo and the captain's son Jake (Cirroc Lofton) travel to Earth to assist Starfleet Security in developing their anti-Dominion defenses; while there, Ben discovers that his former superior, Admiral Leyton (Robert Foxworth) is using the changeling scare (as well as an elite group of cadets which Nog is interested in called Red Squad) as leverage to take control of Starfleet Command, a plan which Ben preempts.

The aftermath of his banishment from the Klingon Empire isn't easy for Commander Worf.  His brother who has been disgraced and removed from the High Council for Worf's ""betrayal"" asks for a mercy killing, and Worf's reaction is to purge the brother's memory and give him a new identity.  Henceforth, the commander is framed for accidentally killing the passengers on a transport ship while the Defiant is on convoy duty.  In between these events, his quarters on the station are ransacked, and he gets into a fight with O'Brien and Bashir in Quark's bar over a difference of opinion regarding Quark's striking employees, after which Worf decides to switch his quarters onto the Defiant, a ship which he has become infatuated with during his time on the station.  Meanwhile, the situation in Quark's (which has begun with Quark slashing his employees' salaries, leading to Rom starting a union, then the strike) gets tenser when Quark tries bribing Rom to dissolve the union and Brunt (Jeffrey Combs) from the Ferengi Commerce Authority shows up with two Nausicans to bully Quark.  Quark convinces Rom to kill the union if the employees' salaries will be restored.  At the same time, Kira's next meeting with Dukat sees him commandeering a Klingon bird of prey, launching a private, vindictive war against the rest of the Klingons and allowing the major to bring his illegitimate daughter, Ziyal to live on DS9.  Not to mention, Miles O'Brien's wife Keiko (Rosalind Chao) becomes pregnant with their second child, and Miles, himself is framed of espionage on Agrathi and sentenced to a 20-year prison sentence (this sentence being implanted into his brain instead of being lived over an actual 20-year time span).  When he gets out, Julian Bashir must talk Miles out of killing himself.

Afterwards, Odo is visited for the last time by Betazoid Ambassador Lwoxanna Troi (Majel Barrett-Roddenberry), who reveals she has married a Tabnian, become pregnant with a son and wishes to cut all ties with her husband, in order to raise the son on her own.  Mrs. Troi attempts to comfort Odo, whose feelings of hostility when Major Kira began a relationship with Bajoran First Minister Shakkar have been hard to suppress and had almost allowed Shakkar to be murdered by the True Way.  Odo weds with the ambassador to remove her ex-husband from the picture.  Simultaneously, Jake is given inspiration for a novel by a strange alien who tries absorbing his life force as he writes.  Immediately following, a Maquis plot to commandeer a ship full of industrial replicators bound for Cardassia is leaked, and Kassidy Yates is ""suspected"" of working as a Maquis smuggler.  In fact, these pieces have been put into place by a double-agent, Lt. Commander Michael Eddington, who uses Kassidy as bait to lure Ben Sisko from the station so he (Eddington) can successfully commandeer the replicators for the Maquis and officially join them, divesting of his uniform & rank.  Sisko vows to track Eddington down and bring him to justice, showing no regard for Eddington's conscious decision.  Then, while the Defiant is engaged in a recognizance mission in the gamma Quadrant, the station is attacked and robbed by renegade Jem'Hadar, prompting the Defiant to re-enter the wormhole to track down the attacking ship and recover what was stolen.  The crew is aided by another Jem'Hadar crew under the control of a Vorta named Weyoun (again performed by Jeffrey Combs), who privately pleads with Odo for the changeling to return to Great Link; Odo promptly refuses.  This sole partnership between the Jem'Hadar and Federation crews successfully manages to shut down a trans-galactic ""Gateway"" which the renegade Jem'Hadar planned on using to take over the universe.

At two points in the forthcoming period, Bashir proves his prowess as a doctor.  The first involves his research in developing a vaccine to a debilitating blight which has infected the entire population of a Gamma Quadrant world abandoned by the Dominion.  The second instance involves a runabout accident in which Keiko O'Brien is inured and her unborn son must be surgically implanted in Major Kira's womb to spend out the rest of its incubation period.  In the immediate interim, Miles and Keiko invite Kira to live in their quarters while she carries the baby, and she asks them to address her as Nerys.  At the same time, Quark gets himself into trouble with liquidator Brunt, after a doctor falsely diagnoses Quark with a fatal disease and Brunt has enacted a contract to receive Quark's vacuum-desiccated remains.  Quark ponders having Garak kill him and instead decides to refund Brunt's latinum, leading the liquidator to present quark with a writ of seizure and suspend his business license.  Quark is humiliated, even when Captain Sisko decides to use his bar as a ""storage facility"" for a collection of bar furniture and supplies.

Henceforth, the biggest change occurs for the station crew, when Odo has somehow contracted a bizarre disease which prevents him from sustaining his solid form.  After a humiliating encounter with a repeat security offender, Odo comes to the conclusion that all the answers lie in the Great Link.  Odo is escorted on board the Defiant by Kira (who has been ordered to remain on the station because of her pregnancy), and the ship takes off through the wormhole.  Upon reaching Dominion-held space, the female changeling (Salome Jens) takes control of the Defiant, so as to prevent the Federation crew learning about the new location of the Great Link.  Upon meeting Odo in Sickbay, Odo deduces on his own what he is about to learn: that the disease is the Founders' way of luring him back to the Link to be judged for breaking a long-sacred tradition: no changeling has ever harmed another.  The Defiant comes to the new home world, and while Odo is being judged in the Link, Garak attempts to access the ship's quantum torpedoes and decimate the planet's surface, but Worf corners and overpowers him.  When Odo is expelled from the Link, Bashir discovers that he's been turned into a humanoid, albeit with the same malformed face which he couldn't get to look human.  The Defiant returns to DS9, Garak is sentenced to six months for his actions on the Defiant, and Odo comes to a conclusion after viewing a general transmission from Klingon space that Chancellor gowron is actually being impersonated by a changeling.

During this end-of-season period, there are three significant arcs which arise and develop during the following year.  They include Major Kira functioning as the surrogate mother to the O'Briens' new baby (who'll be born during Season 5), the suspension of Quark's Ferengi business license (beginning a latency period which will last him almost a year) and the elimination of Odo's shapeshifting abilities (a state which would coincide directly with Kira's pregnancy.  In point of fact, the pregnancy arc was designed from the ground up by the creative department as a way to prevent cast member Nana Visitor from having to disguise her real-life pregnancy by fellow cast member Alexander Siddig with their son, Django El Tahir El Siddig.  Two other threads which crop up during Season 4 and are resolved the following year include the arrest and imprisonment of Captain Kassidy Yates for aiding the Maquis and the escaping of Maquis leader and double-agent Michael Eddington.  Those two incidents mark the first featured mentioning of the Maquis since the Season 3 episode, ""Defiant,"" which was aired just prior to the premier of Star Trek Voyager.  In addition, Season 4 of Deep Space Nine marks Jeffrey Combs' first portrayal of Weyoun, a character whose arc significance would increase during Season 5 and afterwards.",1318377600,,12600,5.127077223851417

It was certainly a huge mistake bringing Worf into the show.  DS9 should have had a chance to be it's own show with it's own characters and stories, but the over-presence of Worf (and character's like Deanna Troi's mother) really bring down the show.  There is deinately not enough Garak in the show as the aliens (Quark, Garak, and Odo) are the heart of the series.  The whole Kingon war element was really pretty slapdash as well, they should have stuck with the Dominion storyline.",1295654400,,636,4.702702702702703
789029,4,6304132344,"After Star Trek TOS and the later seasons of Voyager I've always enjoyed DS9 over the other series (TNG and Enterprise) and despite the unavoidable comparisons with that other great sci fi series Babylon 5 I've always thought that DS9 was different enough from JMS' excellent storyline to avoid being an outright plagiarism.
One thing that DS9 had going for it that Babylon 5 didn't was production money and so unlike the Babylon 5 dvd series, this DS9 dvd series has better special effects, a better soundtrack and overall better picture quality as well. In contrast with the Babylon 5 series where I feel it could definitely benefit from a thorough picture restoration when they finally put it on blu-ray I found this DS9 season 4 dvd set upscales very well to 1080p when I played it on my upscalable blu-ray player. The picture quality is not blu-ray reference quality but is a vast improvement over the first three seasons and although there are some soft and grainy picture frames they were few and far between. The same holds true for the sound quality which is also pretty good unlike the Babylon 5 dvd series which I also hope will undergo intense restoration for the blu-ray release. For this reason, I am happy to stay with these standard dvds of DS9 that I already have rather than to ""upgrade"" to the blu-ray versions should they become available.

Season 4 introduces Worf and hence begins a host of future Klingon linked episodes to follow in this and future seasons and although the episodes are not as consistently high quality as they are on Season 3 you can see some development in the characters although I didn't like a few of the episodes that I thought were stupid but I realise that they may be some other fans' favourites.  I liked ""The Way of the Warrior"" which introduces Worf but I disliked ""The Visitor"" which I found to be overly melodramatic.  I disliked ""Indiscretion"" and I wonder if the writers actually knew this about ""Ziyal"" which is suspiciously close to the Malay word ""sial"" which means ""illegitimate child"" in that language.  How appropriately named she is!  I really, really disliked the Jadzia Dax character and I was glad that she was killed off for Ezri Dax which I preferred infinitely more.  Too bad Jadzia didn't die earlier!  Among the rest of the episodes I only really enjoyed ""Starship Down"", ""Our Man Bashir"", ""Homefront/Paradise Lost"", ""The Bar Association"", ""Rules of Engagement"", and ""Hard Time"" and unlike Season 3 which consistently had great episode after great episode we are forced to endure some pretty poor ones as filler to those I've just mentioned.  I hated the Jadzia character episodes and all the alternate universe episodes and the season-ending episode ""Broken Link"" was pretty lame.

The plastic packaging is also very attractive and robust unlike the Babylon 5 one which I actually had to superglue back together again when the disc holder came apart from the cardboard spine. Overall, this dvd set of season 4 of DS9 sports a good, clean picture and sound transfer which upscales well on blu-ray players.

Overall not as consistently good as Season 3 but the good news is that the episodes improve in Season 5.",1293235200,,3183,4.813186813186813

I never tire of watching it.  What's more, I bought this season used and so at a pretty good discount.  All DVDs were in great shape well worth it.",1281398400,,298,3.8360655737704916
789032,1,6304132344,"Star Trek is about as notorious for its acting as the Star Wars prequels are for its dialog.  Not only that, but the writing on this series is so bad, they could've taken all the decent episodes over the course of seven years and condensed this series down to a single season and saved people a lot of wasted time watching this drivel.  The final halfway decent episode of the series and the only one worth watching out of all of season 4 was ""Hard Time.""  It's the reason why I'd ever give season 4 a 1 star rating rather than 0 stars.  After that one brief exception, root canal would almost be preferable to watching the rest of the series.  Here is a character analysis for season 4.  I found myself rooting for the Jem H'dar, rather than these twerps.

Benjamin Sisko - Take a wooden log, paint a person's face with a stoned expression on it and you get the likeness of Captain Sisko.  99% of his lines are delivered in monotone with those eyes rolled up under those heavy looking lids.  He looks like he's asleep half the time, an effect he had on people who watched him.

Jadzia Dax - By far THE most irritating character in any incarnation of Star Trek, this ""old man"" as Sisko annoyingly calls her is an arrogant, know-it-all whore.  The actress embodies the reason why they generally don't cast Star Trek fans in Star Trek roles, because they simply can't act and she proves it being one herself.  Unfortunately though, her ugly mug with those bug eyes that pop out of her face are in almost every scene.  Later, the actress who played her was ostracized by Hollywood because they finally came to the agreement that she's a terrible actress.

Kira Neris - A Bajoran who had a big chip on her shoulder the first three seasons has now adopted an idiotic grin for some unknown reason.  It's typical however.  Studio heads typically have a hand in getting involved where they don't belong, tossing aside years of story and character development just to have a character look bubbly and perky.

Worf - Imagine William Shatner with an appliance on his head, a ponytail and dark makeup and uttering his lines down one or two octaves and what does that amount to?  The equivalent of Michael Dorn acting like a klingon.  He has the annoying pauses down, but rather than that brief inhale after finishing a line, he does a long exhale out his nose and then his mouth before starting a new one.  Every guest star, even some from the original series played much more interesting Klingons to watch.  Somehow every time they made a Trek movie he magically appeared on the Enterprise with absolutely no explanation how he got there and why he wasn't helping to fight the dominion.  I kept waiting to see how they'd write him in as a regular on Enterprise.

Miles O'Brien - The one redeeming character in all of DS9.  It's no wonder he went on to have a successful movie career.  For some reason, every episode featuring O'Brien is not only watchable, but exceptionally well written and acted by him.  It's a shame that his wife didn't appear more, because she was far more interesting of a character than any of the other female leads.

Quark, Rom and Nog - Quark started out as my favorite character on the series, but became such a one-dimensional character like Worf that I started to admire Rom more.  Sadly, his character is all but forgotten in later seasons.  Same goes for Nog.

Odo, Bashir, Jake Sisko - These characters just moved into the background by season 4 to make room for the new Dax/Worf soap opera.  It's a shame that the two most agonizing characters they could've chosen to feature prominently are apparently who all the Star Trek fans who carry around communicators and insist that you call them ""commander"" want to watch.  It's no wonder to me, considering that the fan favorites of the original series such as ""The Trouble With Tribbles"" and ""Let That Be Your Last Battlefield"" are two of the all-time stupidest episodes of any TV series.",1280102400,2,3958,4.5702127659574465
789033,4,6304132344,"Star Trek Deep Space Nine's third season was generally where the show found itself as an entity seperate from it's mother show&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-The-Next-Generation/dp/B000RZIGVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a>. As it entered it's fourth year the focus of the show began to change. The plotline involving the Dominion begins to take an enormous importence. Since DS9 first premired it's focus,as the Paramount PR department so often reminded us was on a ""darker,edgier Star Trek"" and despite that we were treated to two inaugural seasons with a heavy tone of religion and politics which I rather liked and appreciated. During this time the gritty element of DS9 began to turn more from social intrigue towards often more violent conflict. We begin the season with ""The Way Of The Warrior"" which not only introduces another TNG crossover character in Worf but tears asunder the Klingon/Federation alliance that defined a part of the new era of Star Trek. The remainder of the season deals with more or less the same types of issues: lack of trust,uncertainty and sometimes near total dissaffection among key characters of the show. One such example is ""Hard Time"" which,while very well done as a show is one of my personal least favorite DS9 episodes. The reason is that it takes a classic Trek character,Miles O'Brien from a day and age where the human race has devoted itself to self improvement having an experience that leads him to almost take a phaser to his head. I realize it was an attempt on the part of the writers to create conflict but......let's face it:to all too many people the mid 1990's had a strong nihillistic streak running through it culturally and this and episodes like it really reflect the environment during which it was created rather than the Star Trek universe itself. Now that's not to say this season has no other brilliant moments. One of them is a genuinely touching father/son time travel episode in ""The Visitor"" in which the popular sci fi clishe is given a unique twist. Another excellent episode this season is definately ""Rejoined"" which puts the Jadzia Dax character into the possition of having to engage in what winds up,to our eyes is the first same sex kiss in Star Trek and at least one of the first on TV. One hint though: it's cloaked in Star Trek's old MO:""It's happening on another planet"". Also vital are ""Accession"" where Captain Sisko is confronted by an accidental ""second emmisary"" who seems to be bringing potential ruin to the Bajoran people unintentionally and of course ""Little Green Men"",a mildly comic Ferengi story in which we're supposed to believe it was Quark,Rom,Nog and Odo who crashed in Roswell New Mexico in 1947 and used an atom bomb explosion to return to their time. Of course depending on who you are the double story of Dominion Paranoia on Earth ""Homefront"" and ""Paradise Lost"" may introduce us to the high quality character of the late Brock Peter's Joseph Sisko but also wants to make us believe that after the events of TNG's ""The Drumhead"" that even in the 24'th century an organization as strong and vital as Starfleet embodies the same amount of corruption as...well again many governments of the 1990's. To those who view Star Trek as a source of hope as I do episodes like this can be a huge buzz kill but even so this is an alright season even if in parts it does rather devide different types of Star Trek fans in a manner of speaking with some of it's content.",1277683200,,3544,4.947986577181208

789035,5,6304132344,"Do not miss out on this series.  Yes it is different from the normal wandering the universe, but it shows more character development. The stories are well thought out for the most part, and there is no lack of conflicy.",1268611200,,219,4.475
789036,5,6304132344,"Season Four of DS9 was very much of the same quality of the previous three seasons.  The larger story arcs involving the Cardassians, the Klingons, the Dominion, and the Federation were deepened and continued.  What astonished me most about DS9 was how consistently good it was.  This season was as strong as the previous ones and contained a host of great standalone episodes in addition to furthering the overall story.

One thing that I found especially interesting was the way that they handled Nana Visitor's real-life pregnancy.  The basic decision in these situations is whether or not to hide the pregnancy or make it part of the plot.  On THE X-FILES, they put lots of trench coats on Gillian Anderson to disguise her pregnancy and put her behind a lot of tall counters.  Roxann Dawson's character B'Elanna Torres on STAR TREK: VOYAGER took to wearing her jacket unbuttoned, so that it would billow around her midsection.  Other shows work the pregnancy into the story (interestingly, in one episode of VOYAGER B'Elanna Torres is shown in a fictitious sequence set in Nazi-occupied Europe pregnant, so her pregnancy did make it into the series after all, albeit briefly).  Sydney Bristow's pregnancy became a major component in ALIAS.  But Nana Visitor's pregnancy is probably unique in the history of TV.  Initially the pregnancy was that of the O'Brien's and I have wondered whether that pregnancy was already on the books when Nana Visitor learned that she was pregnant, or whether the O'Brien's pregnancy was created in order to provide a cover for Visitor's real life pregnancy.  But the notion of having Keiko's fetus moved to Kira's womb.  Definitely one of the more innovative responses to a cast member's pregnancy in the history of TV.

So, who said consistent is bad.  Sometimes consistent just means consistently good.  Although DS9 was already my favorite STAR TREK series, I had never actually seen every single episode.  So this time through is a lot of fun, seeing several new episodes that I had never previously seen.  The result has been that DS9 is even more my favorite STAR TREK series than it was before.",1260057600,,2136,4.935574229691877
789037,4,6304132344,"I'd put season 4 a notch above 2 and 3, which were both generally excellent.  It's not quite at the ""firing on all cylinders"" brilliance of the final 3 seasons, but there are only a few duds and even the filler episodes are fairly strong.

Worf's arrival is of course the big surprise here - at times he feels a little grafted on and out of place, though by season 5 he would be an inseparable part of the cast.  The first ten or so episodes are a very strong stretch - ""The Way of the Warrior"", ""The Visitor"", ""Indiscretion"", ""Homefront""/""Paradise Lost"", ""Our Man Bashir"", ""Little Green Men"".  There are few low points - ""The Sword of Kahless"" and ""Sons of Mogh"" (reflecting Star Trek's continuing struggle with making good Klingon episodes) and ""The Muse"" - before the series regains its equilibrium and closes on a strong note.  (""The Quickening"" is a classic.)

The Visitor may be DS9's best episode and certainly its most heartfelt. It also contains the fun episodes Little Green Men, Our Man Bashir, and Bar Association; the suspenseful Homefront/Paradise Lost two-parter; the tragic love stories Crossfire, Rejoined and For the Cause; and many other strong episodes. Season Four also ses the introduction of series regulars Martok, Weyoun, and Joseph Sisko as well as the welcome return of many others (especially Tony Todd as Worf's brother Kurn). The Muse seems to be the weakest episode of the season, but its not nearly as bad as other season's weakest spots. Overall, not as strong as season six or seven, but Deep Space Nine was that rare show that got stronger each year and rewarded viewers who took the time to watch from the beginning.",1251504000,,925,4.898089171974522

789095,5,6304132344,"The Star Trek Collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series DVD Collections (The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise). At around 880 minutes, it is 4 episodes (1 Disc) less than TNG, and at least 2 Discs less than TOS. However in total, for the definitive, Star Trek collection, we are still looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing. That is 1 month of non-stop Star Trek. No DVD series comes remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years. By the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years. It is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also. Our very planet, Earth, has advanced because of Gene Roddenberry's admirable concept. Roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too. They are like our family. Watch what they do. Then go and spend your life striving for the same on Earth. What engineer, medic, scientist, teacher, worker can not say that Star Trek has not influenced them? The show is this significant in the development of our species. Parents respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why. The DVD case may be the best of the lot. The shadowy design is foreboding of a darker trek inside. The case opens to reveal the 6 discs and a collectors' DVD-ROM of a section of a model graphic of DS9 (collect all complete the computer model). The discs are held in an open (no cardboard covering) plastic flip holder like in the TOS seasons. However these collectors' boxes are being replaced by the new slim line boxes that are cheaper. These are simply a cardboard holder with four to five slim DVD case holders with 1 to 2 discs in each holder (The slim line boxes do not contain the special collectors' DVD-ROM). There are 4 episodes per disc. However the last disc, disc 6 is devoted to Star Trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras...and then some more. Often the bonus disc may contain the last episode or two of the season, so watch out for those. Sometimes the episodes are ordered not in the sequence they where filmed, but in the sequence that they aired, however each episode has been numbered according to the order they where filmed in. This means on one disc you have shows 4, 2, 12 and 1, in that order. The sound has also been remastered to 5:1 Dolby Digital! Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.

Star Trek, Deep Space Nine (DS9), Season four is mostly about Worf joining DS9, the collapse of Cardassia and the Klingons breaking the peace treaty.

The same crew is back but with the addition of Worf from The Next Generation. DS9 is commanded by Benjamin Sisko. Jake Sisko is his son. Odo is the station's metamorphosing police constable and a Bajoran operative. Doctor Bashir is the Starfleet doctor and Chief O'Brien is chief engineer. Quark is a Ferengi host who owns a casino and bar. Major Kira is Sisko's first in command, and a Bajoran. Lt. Commander Jadzia Dax is a Trill woman (and a long term friend of Sisko) assigned by Starfleet as technical advisor. Gul Dukat is a leading Cardassian. The Cardassian Garak has a more permanent role to play.

Season Four of DS9 is mostly about Worf, Klingon Empire, other dimensions, Hippocratic Oath, secret affairs, the rules of society, tactics, time travel, mythical artefacts, James Bond, changelings, coup, love, demotion, honour, union strikes, the emissary, court-martial, memory implants, alternative universes, Muse, crime, Jem'Hadar, disease, contracts and Odo's people.

Best episodes are The Way of the Warrior, Hippocratic Oath, The Sword of Kahless, The Quickening and Broken Link.

DS9 Season four is the best of the first four DS9 seasons. The series has matured enough to have a good direction, ripe experienced characters, a sense of something bigger looming, the Defiant means DS9 now has a Star Trek ship and the quality of storytelling has increased tenfold with this season. Nearly every episode is excellent. They have also injected a little more humour but also a lot of darkness. The CGI has improved a lot and there are more space battles than any previous Star Trek instalment. One of the new directions this season goes in is with Worf. The series did need other characters and taking on Worf was an excellent move. The end of season four moves deeper into the Dominions plan to conquer the Federation. Season five looks like it will be all out war for everybody.

Though the Dominion War is already a-brewin' when the season begins, here is where the many over-arching narratives really begin to drive the plots and character subplots; here is where the action begins.

The two-hour season premiere stands out as one of the show's most exciting episodes (when watching the crew of DS9 repel Klingon boarders in brutal hand-to-hand combat, you'll find yourself wondering if Picard and Co. would have had the stuff to survive such a melee...), but the season is also marked by some terrific comedic one-off episodes:  the Roswell episode, the infamous holodeck-based James Bond pastiche, the Ferengi labor union episode...laughs aplenty.  There are more introspective, character-driven episodes as well; all the main characters (and some of the peripheral characters, too) get opportunities to shine, with Chief O'Brien's stint in an alien prison--and its aftermath--being perhaps the most powerful moment in the bunch.

Good science fiction is exciting, thought-provoking, and entertaining, and this season of DS9 is all of those things and more.  A spectacular collection of 'Trek tales.",1203206400,,1223,5.444444444444445
789130,3,6304132344,"Past Prologue is No Emissary that's for sure, but in a season about to be filled with boring tales and a little too much unexcitement, this episode still shines amongst its surrounders.  The acting is still way below what is to come in the series, but has quickly began to improve since the pilot episode.  The story is no where near as good as Emissary, but that is to be expected in a 45 minute episode versus a 90 minute.

Probably the best think about this film, is the introduction of the Garak character (Andrew Robinson) who is the only remaining Cardassian aboard DS9.  A strange fellow who is hard to figure out at times, owning a clothing shop is almost a front for this interesting charcater played by a fine actor who takes the Garak charcater and quickly gives him his own unique personality.  Another treat, mainly for Trekkies, is return of the Duras sisters on Trek, whose earlier appearances in TNG episodes dragged the Klingons into civil war.

The story begins a little weak and uniteresting, but eventually picks up the pace and actually becomes a bit exciting up until a suspensful ending, though the outcome is predictable.  Tensions are still strong between the Federation, the Bajorans, and the Cardassians and one man wishes to stop it all with good old fashioned terrorist activities.  In his attempt to be a hero, Major Kira struggles to put a stop to it, while Garak and the Duras sisters have their own secret meetings that nicely ties in.

Past Prologue is a nice little season one episode that basically survives from a few interesting character appearances.  Other than that its a pretty so-so story that's not such a rough way of spending 45 minutes.

In an interesting move, Worf is added to the show, however, a little less like the loveable puppy he was toward the end of the next generation, but more like a wolf, out of his element.  The shift in the power shift of the cardassians is amazing.  The once proud warlords now reduced to mere annoyances, and the rise of the klingons is welcome return.  I love this show.  Even the amazing episode about Jake as an adult is one of the best episodes of star trek I've seen.  Watch this show!",1187913600,,592,4.327272727272727

789134,4,6304132344,"Comprised of a nice mix of stand-alone episodes and shows that advance the ongoing ""threat of the Dominion"" storyline, this is an enjoyable season of science-fiction adventure.  Of course, the big plus this season was the addition of Worf from ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", which gave the series an extra dose of grittiness and drama.

Other plusses: with regular use of the starship ""Defiant"", this series is now only space station-bound when it wants to be.  I also like the fact that, as this series progresses- and as regularly seen this season- episodes could be literally about anything.  For example, even though Avery Brooks gets top billing, his Captain Sisko character is often only featured as a framing device around a story centering on one of the other characters.  That never happened in Captain Kirk's day.  Which isn't to say that there aren't any good stories about Sisko here.

As always, Paramount once again delivers a quality package.  The episodes look and sound great, and there is a generous boatload of interesting extras.",1176681600,,1052,5.005747126436781

789138,4,6304132344,"This proves to be the season that cements the show with the fans. It starts out with a bang-the return of the Klingons as major players in the storyline brings my favorite character from the Next Generation-Worf! This is a diversion for the start of a very Byzantine plot. Rather than focusing on the obvious-the Domininon, the old foes of the Federation are reintroduced. I admit this was a risk. I was skeptical at first, yet the season opener worked like a theatrical installation.

Worf coming to DS9 makes the show seem familiar and gives fans a sense of security. He knows how to handle adversaries and the Jem Hadar should take note. Last season we were treated with the ""Defiant"". Now its time to move forward with this storyline.

My favorite episodes are Starship Down, Our Man Bashir, Little Green Men and Sons of Mogh.

I felt that the storline slows down later in the season, with little attention to some serious subplots introduced earlier-the Cardassians, Bajorans and the mystery of the Prophets. I assume this will be dealt with later.",1145750400,,1053,4.774725274725275
789139,4,6304132344,"Season 4 of DS9 probably featured the show at its most consistent.  The episodes that helped progress the Dominion arc were almost all solid and entertaining, resulting in an excellent season that delivered action, intrigue, and plenty of tense conflict.  The addition of Worf was a particularly good move, since his charismatic presence provided both a fair share of action heroics and effective humor.

The series stumbled from this point, however, with season 5 being a bit of a step backwards (but still engaging) and season 6 a huge disappointment in particular, as it was populated with too many humor-based episodes in a season that should have been overwhelmingly dark and intense now that the war had taken off.  Thankfully, season 7 delivered the punch I'd expected, and while it isn't as consistent in quality as season 4, the series finished off with some exceptional Dominion War episodes including the excellent Final Chapter arc that delivered grand-scale action, intrigue, suspense, and emotion.  But that's another story.

The Way of the Warrior, Part I- A-.  An engrossing set-up that could lead to potential war between the Klingons and the Federation.

The Way of the Warrior, Part II- A-.  The pay-off is absolutely spectacular.  This is one of the most thrilling DS9 episodes I've seen; the sequence where the Klingons invade DS9 is one of the most ambitious and exciting pieces of action filmmaking in Star Trek history.

The Visitor- B.  A low-key Trek piece.  This one melds plot and emotion rather nicely, even if the solution to the dilemma proves to be a little contrived.

Hippocratic Oath- C.  While it's interesting to see more details about the Jem'Hadar, this episode just isn't all that compelling.

Indiscretion- B.  An enjoyable adventure piece, thanks to the interesting chemistry between Kira and Dukat.  Dukat, in particular, develops into a rather fascinating character when we see a personal side of him we've not seen before.

Starship Down- B.  Though this episode never grips with as much suspense or excitement as it should, it delivers enough action to satisfy.  I am curious, though, as to why destroying those Jem'Hadar fighters wouldn't immediately result in all-out war.

Homefront- B.  The tension continues to build as the Dominion engage in a terrorist attack on Earth.  Though it begins a bit on the slow side, this episode develops some pretty solid suspense towards the end.

Paradise Lost- B.  A satisfying conclusion to Homefront, this fairly taut and suspenseful episode delivers more interesting developments towards the Dominion arc.

Return to Grace- B+.  Another Kira/Dukat episode, and since I find their chemistry quite compelling, it doesn't hurt to see another episode focusing on these two again so soon.  It also doesn't hurt that there's quite a bit of exciting action and suspense here as well.

Sons of Mogh- B.  I've always liked Tony Todd as Worf's brother Kurn, so it's nice to see him one last time.  It's mostly a good episode that delivers some big laughs and decent drama, but the ending feels like a total cheat.

Hard Time- B.  The biggest problem with this episode is that you just know the events that occurred here will never be brought up again, even though we all know it should have affected O'Brien more drastically than the series would like to admit.

To the Death- B. For about 3/4's of this episode's running time, it's a very compelling look into the lives of the Jem'Hadar, but just when you expect it to take off, the climactic hand-to-hand combat seems rather limply staged, at least when compared to such similar scenes featured in The Way of the Warrior.

The Quickening- A-.  My second favorite episode of the season behind only The Way of the Warrior, this Bashir-centered piece is quite moving, with one of DS9's more effective bittersweet endings I've seen (enhanced by a particularly cool swooping crane shot).

Broken Link- B.  A solidly interesting episode, though it boggles the mind when you consider what happens in season 7, meaning Odo was actually infected with 2 diseases here?!  The cliffhanger's pretty good, I might add.",1145404800,,4135,4.997071742313324
789209,4,6304132344,"Season four of DS9 ranks as one of my favorites.  The transfer of Michael Dorn's Commander Worf to DS9 allowed the writers to expand and enhance our knowledge of Klingons and the Empire.  It also provided Michael Dorn the opportunity to develop his character in ways that just weren't possible on ST:TNG.  This season was one of the best for allowing the characters to develop sronger histories and individual personalities.  Several episodes allowed each of then, individually, to step into the limelight for a brief period of time.  Even the supporting characters -- Garak, Dukat, and Rom chiefly -- saw their characters grow.  Among my favorites of this season are ""Indescretion,"" in which we discover Dukat has a half-Bajoran love child; ""Rejoined,"" which re-introduced Dax to a former wife and gave Star Trek its one and only gay themed episode; ""Our Man Bashir,"" a fantastic James Bond homage featuring Julian Bashir; ""The Sword of Kahless,"" a great Klingon episode featuring the wonderful John Colicos; ""Little Green Men,"" a funny Quark/Rom/Nog episode with a wink at Area 51; and ""The Muse,"" which I love because I always liked the chemistry between Majel Barrett's Lwaxana Troi and Rene Auberjonois' Odo.  Season four of DS9 really allowed the show to shine on its own outside of the ST:TNG spotlight and set the pace for the remaining three seasons.",1140912000,,1359,5.013333333333334

789211,5,6304132344,"Nominated for 28 Emmys, including several for Outstanding Visual Effects, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine continues the rich tradition of the original 1960s Star Trek franchise. Created by former L.A. police officer Gene Roddenberry, the Star Trek TV series morphed into a franchise famous for the unprecedented fanatical devotion of its audience. Lasting only three seasons during its original network run, Star Trek struck gold with its syndicated reruns, launching a number of motion pictures featuring the original cast as well as novels, comic books, collectibles, and reams of Star Trek-related memorabilia. Following on the heels of Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987), the first Star Trek series spin-off of the original, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine foreshadowed additional spin-offs - Star Trek: Voyager (1995), and Star Trek: Enterprise (2001). Sporting an entirely new cast and crew from its two predecessors, the show focuses on a particular system administered by the Federation instead of the usual Star Trek mission of ""exploring strange new worlds""...

Star Trek: Deep Space Nine follows the exploits of the Starfleet crew aboard an abandoned and gutted Cardassian space station orbiting the planet of Bajor. In the aftermath of Cardassian occupation, the Bajorian government invited the Starfleet to oversee the reconstruction of the space station. Deep Space Nine quickly transformed into a teeming city of commerce and a hub for travel (similar to Babylon 5) thanks to the discovery of an unknown wormhole nearby. But the wormhole leads to the Gamma Quadrant, realm of the feared Dominion alliance, which views the wormhole travelers as a threat to its totalitarian grip on power. As such, the Dominion launches an attack against the Federation and its Klingon allies. The subsequent and ongoing war is the basis for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine...

Capt. Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) is credited with discovering the wormhole, and he oversees the crew of Deep Space Nine as they wage battle to preserve the Federation. Ironically, his colleague, Constable Odo (Rene Auberjonois), is a Changeling - an alien race of ""shapeshifters"" who lead the Dominion's united front. Together with the rest of the crew aboard Deep Space Nine, they struggle with internal and external conflicts that threaten to destroy their very way of life...

The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (Season 4) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""The Way of the Warrior"" in which, in an attempt to overthrow its newly elected government, the Klingons attack Cardassia. The attack is initially successful, but when several members of the Cardassian government seek refuge on Deep Space Nine, the space station itself becomes the target of the Klingon attack... Other notable episodes from Season 4 include ""The Sword of Kahless"" in which several Deep Space Nine crew members help Worf search for the ancient Sword of Kahless, and ""Shattered Mirror"" in which Sisko ends up in a parallel (i.e. ""mirror"") universe where the Klingons and Cardassians are allies...

789215,1,6304132344,"First, I'd like to say I have at least two HUGE Star Trek fans in my household.  Season 4 was when DS9 really came into it's own as a series.  The stories were excellent, and the characters had finally rounded out.  We own almost all of Next Generation and DS9 sets, and DS9 season 4 was especially good.

My review here has to do with the quality of the DVD itself.

I've recieved two different copies of the season 4 disk set from Amazon.com, and both of the disk sets have had defective disks.

One of the disks in season 4 was unplayable on two of my DVD players, and skipped badly in a third brand new top-of-the-line

third DVD player.  I only mention this because both times I ordered DS9 season 4 from Amazon, I recieved a defective disk set.  I was left to wonder exactly how many of their stock includes similarly defective disks...",1105401600,3,842,4.346153846153846
789216,4,6304132344,"John Colicos returns as Kor again to find ""The Sword of Kahless"". This season also contains ""Rejoined""..the most controversial Star Trek episode ever. Worf from ""Star Trek-The Next Generation"" comes aboard.",1077926400,,206,5.67741935483871
789217,4,6304132344,"Season four saw a lot of changes on Deep Space Nine, both in front of and behind the camera.  The show underwent its first major cast change in the addition of Michael Dorn's Worf to the lineup, and the storyline accommodated this accordingly.  The twists and turns delighted me, and I raced through this season quickly, eager to find out exactly what was going to happen next.
After the Dominion-related adventures of seasons two and three, one would expect season four to continue building up those storylines.  But the writers and producers neatly subverted expectations by throwing the emphasis in other directions.  While there certainly are some stories which keep hyping the threat of the Dominion, the bulk of the uber-story is focused upon what effect the Dominion has had on the Alpha Quadrant.  We therefore see huge changes for the Cardassians, the Klingons and the Federation.  The Dominion, the Jem'Hadar and the Founders do pop up from time to time, but they're kept to the shadows -- a menacing presence quietly trying to manipulate events for their own agenda.
Adding Worf to the cast was an interesting and successful evolution.  I think what I enjoyed the most about it was the fact that after being thrown into the middle of this ongoing storyline at the beginning of the season, Worf doesn't immediately find himself at home.  Given that this is Star Trek we're talking about, I was half expecting Worf to become ""part of the family"" within a couple of weeks.  But he doesn't.  In fact, he is continually irritated by this new crew, and is nostalgic for the calm ordered structure that existed on the Enterprise.  By the middle of the season, he's become so fed up that he moves his living quarters onto the normally empty USS Defiant.  It was great to see a new face on board the station, and it was satisfying to see the creators not violate the individual characters to ease the transition.
Although reviews of Deep Space Nine seasons will tend to talk about what big galaxy-shattering events were going on in that year, I would be neglectful if I didn't also praise the standout standalone episodes.  Of particular note is ""The Visitor"", a story rightly hailed as one of the best of all Star Trek series.  And ""Little Green Men"" is a hilarious romp concerning the real story behind Area 51; it was the Ferengi.
The extras on this DVD are focused towards the events of this season, and most of it concerns itself with how the addition of Worf to the cast affected things behind the scenes.  The writing/producing crew explain how it changed the dynamics among the characters.  Michael Dorn appears in a handful of interviews (taken from various points during the filming of the series and beyond) talking about how he enjoyed playing the character and what directions he wanted to go in.  The producers also mention the freedom they had with Star Trek: The Next Generation being off the air, and Voyager set in a distant corner of the galaxy.  Now the Federation, the Klingons and the Cardassians were theirs alone to play with.  Also included among the extras is the requisite look at the special effects and the alien makeup featured during this year.
I feel like I'm getting into a rut describing these Deep Space Nine season box sets, but yet again we are left with a year that takes the show in bold new directions while also dropping plotlines to be developed later.  I had gradually faded away from the show around this season when the episodes were originally airing, but I'm very glad that I have finally decided to get back into the show now through its release on DVD.",1073260800,15,3603,4.716108452950558

That was up to the fans...
While season three ended with idea that the Changelings were already in the Alpha Quadrant and possibly on Earth, it would nearly half way through the fourth year before these story threads would be picked up again.
It appeared, as the third season was coming to a close, Paramount was already thinking toward the fourth year and was in active -if secret - negotiations with Michael Dorn to bring one of the most popular characters on The Next Generation to Deep Space Nine. Once it was decided, the plot lines from ""The Adversary"" would be pushed aside and a new direction would have to take center stage.
With Worf now coming to DS9, the writers had to figure out how too not only get him on the station, but also keep him there. The writers hatched onto the idea that Klingons, long now the friends of the Federation, were growing restless due to pending invasion of the Dominion and Federations lack of action. Discourse was brewing and as Ben quoted his old friend Curzon Dax, the best people to deal with the Klingons, was a Klingon.
The two-hour opener, ""The Way of the Warrior"", reintroduced the Klingons as bad guys and series was off in a new direction. And that was a good thing.
Over all, the fourth season would see the series really grow stronger, building on what was delivered during the previous season. There was ""Hippocratic Oath"", the brilliant acted and directed episode ""The Visitor"", ""Indiscretion"", the controversial, same-sex kissing of ""Rejoined"", the cat mouse and mouse game of ""Starship Down"", the comedic ""Little Green Men"", the James Bond take off ""Our Man Bashir"", the paranoia two-parter ""Homefront"" and ""Paradise Lost"", the silly ""Bar Association"", the next chapter in the Mirror Universe saga, ""Shattered Mirror"" and another brilliant, if quiet season finale, ""Broken Link"".
Yes, there were a few stinkers, but overall, it was a strong season that would lead into an ever-stronger fifth, sixth and seventh year.
And once again, we are left with disturbing news. As Odo was being judged by his people for the actions in last season's ""The Adversary"", he believes that one of his own people -a Changeling -may be in command of the entire Klingon Empire; an Empire on the brink of war with the Federation...",1068854400,6,2484,4.765661252900232

- RETURN TO GRACE (another great Kira/Dukat episode)
- SONS OF MOGH (a terrific episode with Tony Todd, this time as Worf's brother Kurn)
- RULES OF ENGAGEMENT (A courtroom drama. I love the way this was filmed, with the characters speaking directly into the camera)
- HARD TIME (extraordinary acting by Colm Meaney)
- SHATTERED MIRROR (another visit to the mirror-universe. The scenes with Garak and Worf are very funny)
- TO THE DEATH (introduces Weyoun, played by the great Jeffrey Combs)
- THE QUICKENING (Bashir is taken down a peg or two)
- BROKEN LINK (the ending makes you beg for more, more, more)

789501,5,6304132344,"The introduction of an old friend kicked off DS9's strongest season to date. Worf moved over from TNG to help handle the growing Klingon threat. It would be the start of several storylines which would help to carry the show through to the end.
Worf seemed to be a fish out of water here. Whereas he'd become accustomed to the Enterprise crew, except for Miles O'Brien he was on his own here. Even briefly taking up residence in the tiny quarters on the Defiant.
With Sisko's long overdue promotion to Captain, and his shaved head/goatee (""Spensaaa!"") makeover, Avery Brooks seemed to settle into his role as never before.",1064534400,,621,4.7592592592592595
789502,5,6304132344,"This season is pretty consistent, with nothing below a three star episode, A whole slew of four star episodes, and even one five star episode (the Visitor), one of two I'd give for the series so far (Rule of Acquisition from season two gets the other ""excellent"" from this series.)  One great Rom episode (Bar Association).
I'm buying 'em because I really think this was the right way to watch this series, and more so as the series went on.  The character arcs are mostly really good, The show had a definite look.  Over time, the station really has gotten to feel kind of homey.  I've learned to appreciate the Sisko character, as well as many of the others. Odo only gets more interesting and central as time goes on.  In the Federation universe, Odo is the patron saint of alienation.",1064361600,,788,4.560283687943262
789503,5,6304132344,"This season marks the appearance of Worf coming aboard the station.  I wish he was there since episode one.  The station has a new character with him aboard.  Without giving you a rehash of the episodes reviews others have; I have to say this...Season 4 is when things really start to get interesting!
Worf eventually falls for Dax and we get to see more Klingons aboard the station. Why they didn't let this show run for another few seasons I'll never know.  If it was a matter of casting and price for the regulars...the producers could have made another crew deal with the issues aboard the station. Actors from the former seven years could make guest appearances.  The show was too good to leave the air because so many more stories could have been told.",1062720000,,758,4.5851851851851855
789504,5,6304132344,"As a set, this season ranks highly not only against any other Star Trek season, but any other season of science fiction on TV.  I think ""The Visitor"", ""Hard Time"" and ""The Quickening"" are in the top 5 episodes of all Star Trek.  ""Homefront"" and ""For the Cause"" (and the absolutely brilliant root beer scene in ""Way of the Warrior"") bring complexity and conflict to the ideals of the Federation, which were not adequately examined before in DS9 (and totally unquestioned in TNG).  ""Indiscretion"" and ""Return to Grace"" give tremendous depth and understanding to Ducat, one of my favorite characters.  ""Crossfire"" does the same to Odo - I love how the terrorist plotline becomes less important as the episode sinks into Odo's turmoil, and it's anti-climactic ending becoming something of a surprise to the viewer (and Odo).  Klingons tend to be very boring characters, but Worf shows some un-Klingon attributes by being both unprepared, but willing to learn from mistakes in ""Rules of Engagement"" and ""Starship Down"".  Even the Ferengi and Dax episodes were good.  I think there was only one sub-par episode (""The Muse"").
Getting every season of every Star Trek series is expensive.  For those that pick and choose, make sure this set is one you buy.",1061769600,11,1247,4.9330143540669855
789505,5,6304132344,"DS9's fourth season can arguably be titled the series best season!  As the first three seasons easily proved that they could reach the entire range of emotions and touchstones from the various episodes; the fourth season proved that they could take an excellent series and make it even better.
Between the third and fourth seasons Paramount prompted the producers to ""shake up the series"" but didn't tell them how they wanted them to do it.  This initially left them shaking their heads until they touched upon a quote from ""The Die is Cast"" in which a Changeling stated that in the future all they had to worry about was the Klingons and the Federation and that wouldn't be for much longer.  As time would prove, this quote set them on the path to an outstanding story arc that would carry the series all the way through to the final episode of the seventh season.
The addition of Michael Dorn and his character Worf was pure brilliance.  Of all of the STNG characters, his was the most beloved by a majority of the fans and despite the character feeling that he didn't fit in too well with those around him on the space station, he fit in perfectly!
One extremely important change is Sisko's promotion to Captain which should've happened previously.  Also shaking up the series was the addition of a much more powerful defensive system on DS9 itself as the Klingons would soon find out in the season opener.  We're also introduced to Martok, played brilliantly by J.G. Hertzler, which was unknown at the time but his character turned into to one of the most popular recurring characters of the series.
A brief synopsis of the more outstanding episodes, (Every episode of the season was outstanding but unfortunately there's a 1k word cutoff):
Way of the Warrior - In this extraordinarily exciting season opener the Klingons have decided that the Cardassian government has been taken over by Changelings and stage an invasion fleet at DS9.  In order to help deal with the issue, Sisko sends for Worf, after all, who better to deal with Klingons than a Klingon.  This episode was but the first of many huge space battles involving countless ships that the series produced so beautifully.
The Visitor - In this emotionally charged episode that is one of DS9's most popular episodes, Tony Todd guest stars as an older Jake Sisko that witnessed the death of his father!  Captain Sisko would periodically show up for a few minutes leaving Jake to try and figure out how to get his father back!
Rejoined - Dubbed one of the series and Star Trek's most controversial episodes, this episode highlights what one would think would be a prominent thing among Trill, two symbionts who were previously married when they were with two different hosts.  Directed admirably by Avery Brooks, this episode highlights what Star Trek is all about!
Little Green Men - In this hilarious Ferengi episode Quark's cousin Gaila has given him a shuttle and he decides to use it to take Nog to Starfleet Academy on Earth.  Unbeknownst to him, the shuttle isn't exactly in the best working condition and an accident occurs.  Quark, Rom and Nog wake up to find themselves in Roswell, New Mexico in the 1940's being interrogated by the military.
Our Man Bashir - This is the first of the exceptionally entertaining episodes where we visit Bashir in the holosuite as he's playing out his fantasy of being a 1960's spy for her majesty's government!  Unfortunately for the rest of the crew, there's been an accident on a runabout and they've been integrated into the running program.  Along for the fun is the real spy, Garak.
Homefront & Paradise Lost - Originally set to be the season three cliffhanger and season four opener, these pivotal episodes show exactly how much chaos the Founders can create when they blow up a conference on Earth, prompting a recall to Earth of Captain Sisko.  We meet his father who had previously been intimated to have died.
Sons of Mogh - Tony Todd makes a return as Kurn, Worf's brother!  Due to Worf's disgrace in the Empire, Kurn requests that Worf kill him which would make his death an honorable one.
Hard Time - This is a superb O'Brien episode as we see him deal with the after effect of being convicted of a crime on another planet and sentenced to twenty years in prison.  He was hooked up to a machine and did these twenty years in his head in a relatively short period of time.
The Quickening - This is an extraordinary episode in which Bashir finds himself on a planet in the Gamma Quadrant that had defied the Dominion.  As punishment, they've been suffering the ""blight"" for nearly two centuries.  Bashir does everything he can to come up with a cure.
Broken Link - In this pivotal episode, Odo becomes sick and must be taken to Founders who seem to be the only ones who can save him.  Upon arrival in Dominion space, the Founder leader shows up and tells him that his sickness was no accident and that he must come to their new homeworld to be judged for his crime of being the first Changeling to ever harm another.  The conclusion of the episode is astonishing to say the least and sets up the fifth season beautifully as we learn that Chancellor Gowron has been replaced by a Changeling.

789506,5,6304132344,"The fact that the Klingons and Worf most notably came back into the fold makes this worthwhile but the action did not stop with the Klingons.  This season had many fine episodes, some dealing with the Dominion, the Bajorans, the Maquis, and some that were just funny. This was the season that also had The visitor, one of DS9's most acclaimed episodes.
Highlights:
Way of the Warrior:  Worf comes to DS9 as relations with the Klingons erode. This had some of the best battle sequences and we see the stations weapons kick ass for the first time.  It is almost interesting to note that this is where Dukat starts to look like he might be a good guy even though he is not.
The Visitor:  A sad and very well recieved episode.  Jake loses his Dad and tries his whole life to get him back.  This was truly one of Avery's best performances.  Tony Todd was also great.
Little Green Men:  Quark, Rom, Nog and Odo, at Roswell, 1947. THis was just hilarious, especially when Quark, Rom and Nog were banging their heads to get the universal translators to work.
The Sword of Kahless:  Kor, Worf and Dax go to the gamma quadrant to look for the lost sword.  Not only do they have to battle Toral, but also each other.
Our Man Bashir: Dr. Bashir plays James Bond in the Hollow Suite.  Then the characters take the form of his crewmates. Sisko as Dr. Noah is funny and crazy all in one.
Crossfire:  Odo has feelings for Kira, but she gets involved with Shakaar.  Anybody who has lived through adolescence should be able to relate to this story.
Return to Grace: Dukat is commanding a freighter after being disgraced, and plans to go after the Klingons, with a little help from Kira.
Sons of Mogh:  Worf's brother Kurn is dishonored and wants Worf to kill him. Worf has to come to grips with the fact that he has lost his Klingon instincts and values.
Rules of Engagement:  Worf is on trial for destroying a civilian transport.  The Klingons want to extradite him and try him on the homeworld.
Shattered Mirror:  Another Parallel Universe episode.  The alliance under the command of Worf want to retake Terok Nor after loosing it to the human rebels. This was another episode with some great battle footage.
For the Cause:  Michael Eddington defects to the Maquis.  Cassidy Yates is a smuggler.
To the Death:  The Federation and Dominion join forces to fight rebel Jem Hadar.
Broken Link:  Odo is on trial for killing a changeling.  The Dominion is found to be responsible for the hostilities between the Klingons and Federation.
These are not the only highlights. The whole season was a highlight.  This was the second best season behind the sixth season, but these are my favorites from DS9 season 4.",1059868800,3,2687,4.584905660377358
789575,5,6304132344,"First, let me make a small admission. I am not what you would call a Star Trek fan, or trekkie. I watched a little bit of the original show with Captain Kirk, and a few of the ones with Patrick Stewart, but had never seen any of the Deep Space Nine episodes. A colleague at the lab brought me the DVD of season 4 when he heard I had gotten a DVD player. I watched the tape, thinking I'd be mildly entertained. Well let me tell you, I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY!!!! The story-telling, the conflicts, the characters were some of the finest I have ever seen in any genre, not just space opera. I know my Star Trek reference set is limited, but I promise I've been watching as much of the episodes as I can. I've just about got my TiVo figured out, and when I do, I will be officially hooked. Having seen some episodes from earlier and later seasons now, I still find the overarching season 4 storyline to be the most engaging. Plus, I just really like the Klingons. Really great.",1059436800,,975,4.247311827956989
789576,3,6304132344,"I found PAST PROLOGUE to be a fairly decent episode.  Not the greatest thing I'd ever seen, but an enjoyable story all the same.  It revolves mostly around Sisko, Kira, and Bajoran politics, and by focusing on a smaller number of characters, we get a fairly good story with few distractions.
When a known Bajoran terrorist seeks asylum on the Deep Space Nine station, Sisko finds himself negotiating between the Cardassians and the Bajorans, as well as navigating the tricky political situation that now exists on Bajor.  Some former terrorists currently make up key members of the Bajoran government (including one Major Kira Nerys).  Others have remained killers, opposed to the provisional government of Bajor and the presence of the Federation, whom they view as distasteful as the Cardassians.  Sisko must decide what the terrorist's real intentions are: whether he has truly reformed or is just twisting his story as cover for further illegal and murderous activities.
It's an interesting little story.  While it's at times predictable, real-world comparisons are unavoidable.  We know that loyalties will be tested among the regular characters, and although we can probably guess what the resolutions will be, it's exciting to see exactly how they will get to that conclusion.
This episode also introduces Garak, and reintroduces the Klingon sisters from one of the Next Generation movies that I found to be utterly unmemorable.  The scenes of those Klingon sisters rather bored me, and I was glad that they didn't take up too much screen-time.  Apparently, they were considered popular on The Next Generation, but I just found them to be distracting and out of place.  Fortunately, they aren't enough to sabotage this particular episode, which is a good, solid story.  Star Trek has always been known for taking a real-life ethical decision, putting it into a science-fiction allegory, and then trying to tell as good a story as is possible within the confines of one hour of television.  PAST PROLOGUE adequately continues this tradition.",1059350400,,2047,5.16969696969697
789577,4,6304132344,"After three solid seasons, Star Trek Deep Space Nine truly became a landmark television series in the fourth season. The season premier two-parter: 'The Way of the Warrior' was as exciting as television action action gets, in addition to continuing DS9's signature 'sereial' storytelling style. Season highlights such as 'The Visitor' and 'The Quickening' are devistatingly emotional in their impact, and expamples of some of the finest drama television has to offer. The Dominion arc continues as the season takes a brief detour into the short lived Klingon war (hey, it was worth a shot, right?) and the show welcomed Michael Dorn's Worf into it's ranks of capable performers.",1055980800,2,678,5.229357798165138
789578,5,6304132344,"While I wouldn't go so far as to call season 4 the best of DS9, it certainly is in the running. With the introduction of Worf into the mix, things suddenly got bumpy as the Klingons were introduced more and more regularly. There's a number of twists and turns regarding Eddington and the regulars that allowed DS9 to surpass NextGen as the best Trek show ever.
In The Way of the Warrior the Federation/Klingon alliance splinters. Hippocratic Oath deals with an unusual casualty of war--the slaves forced to fight it. Bashir tries to cure the Jem'Hadar of their addiction to ""the white"" against the wishes of fellow prisoner O'Brien. The Visitor is one of the most touching and emotionally powerful episodes written. Michael Taylor's story uses a convention that Kurt Vonnegut did in Slaugterhouse Five; Sisko becomes ""unstuck in time"". The only constant in is his reappearences is Jake. It's a beautifully realized script with nuanced performances from Tony Todd (who had auditioned for the role of Sisko)and Avery Brooks.
Dukat is further softened up as we discover he has a half Bajoran daughter he intends to rescue in Indescretion. He enlists a reluctant Kira to help. Though Dukat's edgy character is blunted somewhat, it adds further depth to a villan that was characteristic of DS9. The marvelous Marc Alaimo continues to amaze in this well designed episode. He's one of the most underappreciated character actors. In many respects, Indiscretion was clearly inspired by John Ford's classic western The Seachers. Rejoined allows DS9 to dip its toe in the sexuality of Trills. Dax meets a former lover and has a hard time resisting her attraction to this person. Well directed by Avery Brooks, Rejoined does what classic Trek does best--deal with difficult issues and emotions in a 45 minute episode of television. There are a number of other delightful, well written, directed and acted episodes included here.
Little Green Men was a bit too cute for me at first, but I've grown to like it over time. We finally find out the truth about Roswell and it ain't what you expect. Quark makes an early appearence on Earth and the script by Ira Steven Behr and writing partner Robert Hewitt Wolfe delightfully skewers America in 1947. While I'm not a huge fan of the ""holosuite"" adventures of the crew (their a bit too common and done a bit too often for my taste), Our Man Bashir is still a standout. It's a marvelous confection that tips its hat to Our Man Flint, the Bond films and Matt Helm. Ron Moore's script is on target and we discover that Avery Brooks would make a wonderful Bond villan. Are you listening MGM? Finally, Homefront demonstrates what DS9 and writer Behr & Wolfe always did best--create an atmosphere of paranoia and darkness in Roddenberry's optimistic future world. The shapeshifters are on Earth and they're quite busy undermining security. Or are they? Robert Foxworth (another great character actor)does a terrific turn as an Admiral that will use any excuse to seize power whether or not it really is in the Federation's best interest or not.
I can't comment on the discs because the set hasn't been released yet as of this writing. The DS9 sets have been improving with each set and, while the extras are nice, there's nothing like having the original episodes. My only complaint is that, again, no one was contacted to do any episodic commentary. There's no booklet to give an overview of the series episodes. I personally like the way B5 has included the previews for each episode from the original promos. These allow you to get an idea as to what each episode is about. In the absence of a booklet, these would do quite nicely as well although I doubt that Paramount will change the sets at this late date.
While many B5 fans complain that DS9 ripped off B5 (and I'm a B5 fan), it's not the actual concept of the series that matters. What matters is the quality of the acting, writing and directing of each individual episode and season. DS9, like B5, was an outstanding series even when compared to other mainstream television programs.",1055289600,32,4070,4.815714285714286
789579,5,6304132344,"The Fourth season was far and away the creative peak of DS9 overall. Though the decision to make the Klingons an enemy again was good-intentioned it was utlimately one of the few true storytelling mishaps of the series -- luckily it didn't take a hugely prominent role in the 4th year (the Dominion stepped up to the plate here).  While the third season served as a mostly introductory period to the Dominion, the fourth much more deeply explores this mysterious and terrifying new threat.
IN between, some of the best Star Trek episodes ever made are produced -- highlighted by ""The Visitor"", which ranks with ""The Inner Light"" and ""City on the Edge of Forever"" as Trek's most moving episodes ever made.
Most of DS9's all-time best episodes are in the 4th YEAR, including...

789582,5,6304132344,"Season 4 of Deep Space Nine was a pivotal one in the show for many reasons. The Dominion takes a far more prominent role in the storytelling, which becomes far more sophisticated in this season. There is great character development across the board, including the addition of fan favorite Worf, which once again alters the show's dynamic. The season has it all: human drama, great space opera, and wonderful continuing storylines. Put simply, this is a complete season that just begins to show the show's full potential.
Worf's welcome to the show in ""The Way of the Warrior"" introduced the static between the Klingons and Federation that would last for a little more than a season. Several other klingon characters, including General Martok, were introduced here who, although they didn't factor in much here, would eventually become prominent players later on. The episode is one of the show's most action-packed, and it also carries on the tradition of the show having strong first episodes to start out the season. After this episode comes the emotionally-packed ""The Visitor,"" which is, without a doubt, the most poignant episode of the show, perhaps of any show ever. Jake Sisko spends his whole life trying to find a way to bring his father back to life after Benjamin is killed in an engine room accident. Brilliant and provocative acting from Tony Todd as old Jake. After this strong start the show kicked into high gear. ""Hippocratic Oath"" explores the nature of the Jem'Hadar, ""Starship Down"" is a tribute to submarine movies, ""Little Green Men"" is the show's most tongue-in-cheek episode, which is as funny as it is provocative. The episode has Quark, Rom and Nog being stranded in Roswell circa 1947 after a time-travel accident. It is the most funny Star Trek experience since the fourth feature film. ""Our Man Bashir"" is a combination good, whimsical spy story and people-working-against-time-to-save-people story with some precious lines from Garak, a real spy. After he sees the opulent life of spies in 20th-century Earth, he comments, ""All these years I've been working for the wrong government."" Good stuff. There is a magnificent two-part episode, ""Homefront"" and ""Paradise Lost"", which explores the intricacies of Federation Politics, the Starfleet/Federation situation, and civil liberties. The episode features some powerful dialogue, as well as some intense fight scenes. ""Bar Association"" has Rom standing up to his brother and creating a union, ""Rules of Engagement"" makes Worf face his deep-seeded resentment against his race. Yet another trip to the mirror universe in ""Shattered Mirror"", Michael Eddington's defection in ""For the Cause"", and more encounters with the Dominion in ""To The Death"" and ""Broken Link"" round out this season with a final development that shows just how sophisticated the plot structure became.
As can be plainly seen, the season is replete with highlights. In fact, substandard episodes are few and far between. ""Rejoined"" is one such episode. An interesting concept foiled by improbable characterization, predictable plotting, and wholly unsatisfying storytelling. The show must have been filmed during sweeps, because the inevitable lesbian kiss is performed without any passion. Come on, people, Dax just isn't the impulsive, driven by hormones type. With all that wisdom she should have an evolved view on romance. Alas. ""The Muse"" also is hardly stellar, with trite plotting and yet another visit from Lwaxana Troi, who had already overstayed her welcome.
Although not perfect, one can see that the sub-standard episodes were becoming fewer and farther between by this time, and there was a much greater proportion of hits than misses than before. This season is an incredible dramatic accomplishment and sets up the extremely prodigious later seasons. This is a must-buy for all fans of dramatic achievement or science fiction.",1047427200,20,3889,5.254019292604502

One of the most exciting SCI-FI television series returns in it's fourth season on DVD. That series being Star Trek: Deep Space Nine season 4 on DVD. In this season of the show, viewers of the program get to experience the full realm and in-depth plots and various stories of conflict which placed Star Trek: Deep Space Nine in high uniqueness among all other Star Trek universe of programs.
In this season of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine the character called Worf played by ""Michael Dorn"" is introduced into the cast of the show. Worf is brought in to ease the conflict between the Federation and the Klingons. The Klingons are convinced that their life long enemies the Cardassians are being controlled by the Dominion. Season 4 of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine really focuses a great deal on the Klingon Society especially when the introduction of Worf's brother and a elderly Klingon Warrior are brought into the series. These elements come to a conclusion near the end of the season with a stunning episode that makes the audience excited for the next season.
Also in this season, there is particular emphasis on the character development of the Cardassian Officer Dukat played by ""Marc Alaimo"". In previous seasons, Dukat appeared briefly in several episodes throughout the program but in season 4, this character takes a more dominate part which will lead to a significant shift in the way Star Trek programs are written. Never before in the history of Star Trek programs has a minor character risen to take a central role in determining the outcome of the story. This event was among a many series of first for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine which would be repeated over and over again.
In this season, the character called Odo played by ""Rene Auberjonois"" finally reveals his affection for Kira Nerys played by ""Nana Visitor"" to others on the station. Odo is tormented by this affection because he also feels a since of belonging to his own changeling people. Trying to bury his feelings into his work, he only realizes even more that his emotions for Kira will way heavy on him even with the imminent possibility that the station will be plunged into a galactic war. Even without knowing Odo's feelings for her Kira Nerys or Major Kira finds new respect for an old enemy and finds compassion in the plight of his daughter Tora Ziyal played by ""Cyia Batten"".
In all of this in-depth drama, viewers are treated to views of earth as the character Benjamin Sisko played by ""Avery Brooks"" returns home to deal with issues regarding the Federation and it's response to possible war with the Klingons and or the  Dominion. Sisko finds himself trouble at all of the events happening around him and returns to his originals and family in a small restaurant in New Orleans. It is these series of episodes that really define the character of the man that would some day be forced to deal with and fight in an eventual war to defend the Federation.
There is so much more in season 4 of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine that I would encourage you to find out for yourself by purchasing this DVD. Star Trek: Deep Space Nine season 4 has so much in story, theme and character development throughout the series that you certainly find that season 4 is among the best.

If you like deep stories, excellent dialog with some very good special effects to enhance the settings, then I would encourage you to purchase Star Trek: Deep Space Nine season 4 on DVD.

7862206,5,6304132344,"DS9 pales in comparison to TNG, but that is honestly too high of a bar to set when evaluating a syfi series. Although too much attention is given to Bajor's system of religion and Sisko's role in it (seriously silly/boring), the character development and interplay is excellent. Garak, Odo, Quark, O'Brien are particularly masterfully played. The storyline picks up in season 4 and never looks back. I hope Star Trek never tries another series without a ship, but DS9 became a worthwhile endeavor that will forever be the most unique version of Star Trek.",1514592000,,555,4.914893617021277
7862207,4,6304132344,"There was too much focus on the Dominion and the Marquis. I'd like more variety. I'll continue to watch the entire show to the end (all seven seasons), but I remembered why this was not on my must-see list when it originally aired. Some of the episodes were very exciting while others felt repetitive. It is fun seeing shows that I skipped, but I feel that this season did not live up to its potential. Some of the individual episodes warranted five stars, but I have to give this season four stars because I feel like here is where the show began to get bogged down with the Dominion thread. It would have made a nice ark, for a few shows, but not the dominating presence that it is becoming.",1509667200,,693,4.338461538461538

7862209,2,6304132344,"I thought the arrival of Worf on the station might improve the series (and indeed, it's nice to see Worf in a role where he's not constantly second-guessed by Picard, emasculated by Lwaxana Troi or beaten up by visiting aliens) but the series really starts to feel like a strain. There are a few notable episodes, including a Dominion-themed one involving martial law episode on earth with some fascinating Sisko family back story, but there's also YET ANOTHER Mirror Universe story, and a ridiculous Lwaxana Troi pregnancy episode (seriously?) Likewise the Dax romance episode made no sense in that it seemed like Curzon character all but took over all of her other hosts in order to fall for an old flame (this seemed to go against the blended personalities we've grown to accept for this character and the episode subsequently made no sense.) Ending with Odo's humanity was also a fairly unsatisfying cliffhanger leaving me with little interest in going on to season 5. Is it just going to be more Dominion wars, another mirror universe story, and another Lwaxana Troi? I'm going to see it through but this season was ultimately a disappointment.",1504224000,,1149,4.927835051546392
