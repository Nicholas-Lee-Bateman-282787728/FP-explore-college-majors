4698697,5,B005GYXN36,"""Santa Who?"" is one of our families favorite Christmas movies. Leslie Nielsen does a great job as Santa and we love the elves in this movie. We only had a VHS copy so we bought the DVD.  The delivery time was fast and the price was great.",1327881600,4,238,4.0638297872340425
4698698,5,B005GYXN36,"This was a Christmas present for my Mom, she loves to watch Christmas movies. I haven't watched any of the movies that I've bought off Amazon yet, but she hasn't complained about the quality of them yet so all is good in the world!",1326585600,,231,4.2727272727272725
4698699,5,B005GYXN36,We had recorded Santa Who on a VCR tape years ago from tv. Now we are trying to replace all those movies with DVDs. This one met our expectations entirely and the bonus Chance of Snow movie is a good one too.,1325721600,,208,3.9761904761904763
4698700,5,B005GYXN36,Very happy with the dvd. Received it quickly and in great condition. So excited to be able to view these movies when I want. Love the movies!,1325203200,,141,4.2592592592592595
4698701,4,B005GYXN36,"Santa Who is good comedy entertainment and Chance of Snow is drama.  Any Leslie Nielsen comedy is guaranteed to make one laugh.  This fact make the purchase worth the price by itself.  On the other hand, Chance of Snow tugs at the heart somewhat while making one laugh at the same time.  The divorced couple snowed in at the same airport is a good premise and the film is good family entertainment.  For the price I recommend this selection.",1325116800,8,441,4.531645569620253
4698702,1,B005GYXN36,"Having Leslie Nielsen in ""Santa Who"" is the reason we got suckered into getting this turkey, and really, I wish he had known that if he needed a job that bad, we would have let him sleep on our couch until he found a decent gig.

Santa Who is a made-for-TV movie that gives made-for-TV movies a bad name. It has every trite cliche and every bit of bad writing you can think of. It has children that, if real, would make people everywhere realize that reproducing is evil. Adults that are less than one-dimensional, and stupider than a box of really stupid rocks. Bad pacing, dumb situations... and worst of all, during the time I watched it (before my rising stomach made me turn it off) nothing funny happened! There's nothing good about this movie.

Don't waste your money or your time.

(I'm ignoring the other movie on the disc, ""A Chance of Snow"". Proceed at your own risk.)",1324080000,,879,4.48125

4698717,5,B005GYXN36,"A nice double feature with some comedy and heart for Christmas.  They are shown from time to time around the holiday season but I recommend buying this through Amazon to add to your library.

4698718,5,B005GYXN36,"For the price, this was a great purchase. Although the movies are different, they both have the feel good Christmas holiday cheer.  Santa Who?, starring Leslie Nielson,  has Santa losing his memory and hope at Christmas time, but all turns out well thanks to a young child.  The second movie, A Chance of Snow, about Maddie and Matt Parker, a divorcing couple,  stranded at the airport,  with their children and Maddie's sister, Katherine.  After the Parker's meet the Pulmer's, an older couple who also suffered marital problems, Maddie and Matt look at their marriage differently and reach a decision on what why really want from each other.",1396915200,2,643,4.962616822429907
4698719,5,B005GYXN36,"This movie is awesome. Really gets you in the spirit of Christmas and snow, hot chocolate, family and friends . This the season.",1396224000,,128,4.608695652173913
4698720,4,B005GYXN36,"Maybe they are not destined to become classics, but they are both quite enjoyable, if you're looking for Christmas themed entertainment.",1395187200,,136,5.523809523809524
4698721,5,B005GYXN36,Both very good movies and both movies displaying a need for believing. I enjoyed both movies. I don't always buy double features as I prefer to file my movies alphabetically,1390176000,,173,4.8
4698722,5,B005GYXN36,A little bit of holiday escapism to get you in the mood for Christmas. Take some time off from trimming the tree and relax.,1389052800,,123,4.166666666666667
4698723,4,B005GYXN36,"I had somehow missed these when they were new. I really hoped I wasn't wasting my money, but it was money well spent. My husband likes them as much as I do. We both love watching holiday movies (he's more picky), and since we gave up the high cost of cable etc. six years ago I am always watching for low prices to increase my video collection. ""Santa Who"" is great for the whole family because it shows young children that there really is a Santa. (Give them a chance to be kids!)
""A Chance of Snow"" is also a good family movie, just not aimed at the little ones.
I recommend the both for an enjoyable family movie night!",1381104000,4,622,4.191666666666666
4698724,4,B005GYXN36,I could watch a million...all year long.  They are clean and sweet and always end happy-ever-after. The perfect thing for movie night in December (or November if I can sneak one in early).,1380672000,3,188,4.696969696969697

4698726,5,B005GYXN36,"loved the film it was so cool but I have always been a sucker for christmas movies.who can,t love a movie like this one",1378598400,,119,4.0
4698727,5,B005GYXN36,"I gave it five stars even though I believe the ending is different. I had bought it on a VHS which I guess I donated once I got it on a DVD so I cannot be sure, but it seems the VHS movie ended with Jingle Bell Rock, but this movie on DVD doesn't. I miss that because I had never liked that Christmas song until I heard it at the end of the movie. Oh, well. The movie itself is hilarious even though predictable. With Leslie Nielsen playing Saint Nick I don't think you can go wrong. Of course his second-hand man Max also added a lot to the movie. I thought the actors in it carried their parts very well and loved how the child actor portrayed the small boy whose name I forget. He had all the enthusiasm about Christmas most children do at that age. I also watched A Chance of Snow as I happen to like JoBeth Williams but while I am sure I enjoyed it, it was too long ago for me to review it now. I should watch it again at Christmas and add my review of it at that time. I do remember Charles Durning in it whom I enjoyed playing Santa in Mrs. Santa Claus and It Almost Wasn't Christmas so it is bound to be a good movie to watch.",1373673600,,1134,3.9347826086956523

4698730,4,B005GYXN36,"I only bought this for Santa Who. I absolutely love that movie. It turned out great when it arrived. I still haven't watched the other movie yet, but it is worth the cheap purchase just for Santa Who!",1361318400,,200,4.2894736842105265
4698731,4,B005GYXN36,This was a gift but I imagine it was very good considering Leslie Nielsen was in it.  Don't you think so?,1358640000,,105,4.0
4698732,5,B005GYXN36,Chance of Snow was excellent. Santa Who was fun as well. The product was shipped w/o a hitch. Good price. Nice to have around the holidays. Both films would be age appropriate for the whole family.,1358121600,,197,4.5

8472451,3,B005GYXN36,"These are 2 films you can barely get through once.  Passable entertainment but once you watch either one you will forget them because they offer ""Nothing New"" or anything too memorable.  Of the two film "" AChance of Snow"" is the better one.  The adult cast are all great and there is not one false performance between them.  JoBeth Williams is a standout but the screenplay let's her down.  I bought this set only because I wanted to see ""A Chance of Snow"".  ""Santa Who"" is terrible.",1447891200,,483,4.494252873563219
