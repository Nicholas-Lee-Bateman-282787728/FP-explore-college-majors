A great 12-4 season under Jon Gruden put the Raiders back to the top of the NFL.  Seeing the Chefs and the Whiners finish with losing seasons made the year 2000 even better.
Andre Rison was a great addition to the Raiders and made his mark with the winning touchdown late against the Chargers.  Rich Gannon proved the Chefs made am mistake in choosing Grbac over himself by having yet another Pro Bowl year.
On defense William Thomas was a great addition and CB Eric Allen was back to his best.  The HOT was rocking as the Raiders won week after week and had their best record since 1990.
In the playoffs the chuckie dolls were out in full force as the Raiders hammered the Dolphins.  If it wasn't for a Marquez Pope play and Gannons injury the Raiders would be in the Superbowl.
With the acquisition of great veterans Jerry Rice and Trace Armstrong the Raiders will have another winning season this year.
Buy the video to relive those great memories of the Raiders season in 2000, the year the Raiders came back.",993081600,4,1230,4.547511312217194
