4510182,5,B004ZKKL5A,"This set is a departure from all previous and recent MST3K DVD set releases in that it contains five episodes all from a single series of movies, Gamera! All five episodes are hosted by show creator, Joel Hodgson and all are from the Comedy Central era of the show. If you've ever wanted to see a robot sing a love song to a turtle or you're a fan of the ""Gameradamerung"" then you must buy this set!

* 302- GAMERA
This 1965 black-and-white film from Daiei studios in Japan was their attempt to cash in on the popularity of a certain other series of films made in Japan about a giant, mutated reptile. While Gamera may be an ersatz Godzilla to some, he's got his own weirdness to recommend him. A nuclear explosion, what else, awakens a giant, mutated, prehistoric flying, fire-breathing turtle from his icy prison to wreak havoc upon the world. A young boy who is especially fond of turtles develops an unusual bond with the monster. The American dubbing and added scenes make the film seem weirder and goofier than ever. This is a must-see episode for all MSTies because of gags like Tom Servo singing ""Tibby Oh Tibby"" and Gamera's visit, played by Mike Nelson, to the SOL via the hexfield view screen. MST3K's riffing machine was in full gear by season three and this is a top-notch episode with hilarious jokes all during the movie and terrific sketches during the host segments as well. This is a contender for the list of top ten all-time greatest episodes.

* 304- GAMERA VS. BARUGON
This is a 1966 follow-up to 1965's Gamera. Barugon is a giant, mutated lizard who shoots a powerful beam of energy from his back. He also has ""ram-tongue"" action. He attacks Japan and Gamera comes to the rescue. It's just that simple and the riffing by Joel and the 'Bots is just that great. The host segment inspired by the film wherein the SOL crew advertise the ""5000-piece fightin' men & monster set"" is phenomenally well done and funny.

* 308- GAMERA VS. GAOS
Gamera was successful in his first two outings so the studio followed up again the next year with Gamera Vs. Gaos in 1967. Gaos is a flying reptile with a wedge-shaped head that shoots high-powered laser beams. Gamera and Gaos chase each other around in a series of monster fights throughout the film. Highlights of this episode include the ""Gameradamerung"" staged by Joel and the 'Bots, the arts and crafts host segment and the final host segment in which they try to come up with a list of other ways to kill Gaos. Again, Gamera inspired the writers at MST3K to do some of their best work, this is hilarious from beginning to end.

* 312- GAMERA VS. GUIRON
This 1969 Gamera film follows the adventures of some young children, two boys and a girl, who discover a flying saucer has landed near their homes. The two boys climb aboard and the ship kidnaps them off to a distant planet. No one will believe the little girl who is left behind. Gamera follows the spaceship and attempts to rescue the boys. The alien planet is inhabited by two attractive alien women who want to eat the boys' brains. They also use their control over the giant monster Guiron to defend their planet from other monsters like Space Gaos and eventually, Gamera. The film features the obligatory fights between actors in rubber monster costumes. Again, the host segments are some of the best ever in the show's history, with Joel and the 'Bots singing the ""Gamera song"" and then Michael Feinstein (played by Mike Nelson) singing it in Deep 13 in the final host segment.

* 316- GAMERA VS. ZIGRA
 Gamera returns in 1971 to take on an alien monster called Zigra. Zigra attacks Earth's moon base then comes to Earth spreading destruction in an attempt to dominate the planet. As usual, small children are involved and are an integral part of saving the Earth with help from our eponymous hero, Gamera the fire-breathing flying turtle. Oh, and one of the children really likes Coca-Cola. Episode highlights include the scale model of Gamera and the different ways to sing the Gamera song. Though some of the writers have complained about how much they hated these movies over the years, you wouldn't know it from watching this or any other Gamera episode of the show. This one's as funny as all the others and that's really saying something. This episode nicely ends the MST3K foray into the world of Gamera and leaves you wishing there were more.

The extra features for this set are:
* So Happy Together: A Look Back at MST3K and Gamera

The only downside to this box set is that it comes with a Gamera movie that was in another box set.  However, it's hardly a negative since this set doesn't really cost more than other box sets AND it comes with a fifth movie.  Basically, they threw in the repeated Gamera movie for free.  Can't really complain about that.

There's a nice interview with several MST3K alumni about the history of MST3K and Gamera. And two interviews about Japanese monster films and the Gamera series in particular.

4510204,5,B004ZKKL5A,This set is a dream come true!  Gamera was my first MST3K experience which was back when I was in Junior High.  Ever since then I have been hooked.  I loved the Gamera films on their own from childhood so this was a match made in heaven.  The special features are enjoyable on their own and worth the price of the set alone.  Especially the history of Gamera which was most delightful.  Of course if you are looking at this set then you already know the true value of these films in their MST3K format.  But on the slight chance that you haven't been exposed let me inform you that these are hilarious and safe for the whole family.  I watch these with my 7 year old all the time because he loves the monsters and the jokes.  There is nothing here but pure entertainment!,1400716800,,771,4.2620689655172415

 When the 5 year old heard Crow say ...""Squish""...he said ""Awww... he stepped on my friend"" ...I was surprised he got that. While these shows are not for everyone....it is nice that I can watch something from my childhood with the Grandchildren and they enjoy it.
 I only have about 10 or so sets and this one is the one that gets the most play. We've seen all these movies a few times now and they are still enjoyable to all of us.

4510211,5,B004ZKKL5A,"Truly an ideal combination, the 1960's-70's ""Showa"" series of Gamera films was the perfect fodder for the sharp-witted gang of goofballs at Mystery Science Theater 3000. Some episodes are funnier than others, but even the lamest ones still have a ton of genuine howlers to keep you laughing. There are a lot of nice bonus goodies included in this handsome set. The whole thing is packaged in a handsome deluxe metal tin. Pretty snazzy! For folks who can't quite get into Japanese giant monster movies, especially something as whacked out as a prehistoric, fire-breathing, flying snapping turtle, this release of the MST3K versions can help make the pain & confusion more palatable. I loved MST3K when it first aired and I'm a huge fan of Gamera, too, so this set was an absolute must-own for me.

I also bought the recent Shout! Factory deluxe releases of the old Gamera films. The films all look just gorgeous in their original widescreen formats, with prints that are beautiful, clean and razor sharp. The English dubs (in some cases, both the AIP TV dubs and the infamous Sandy Frank dubs are available some films!), as well as watching them in their native Japanese language with English subtitles. NOTE: the first two films (GAMERA, GAMER vs. BARUGON) are only available in Japanese with English dubs, so if that's not your cup of tea, be forewarned.

MST3K & GAMERA... the ultimate match that was made in heaven! 5 full stars!!!!!",1395446400,,1436,4.857142857142857
4510212,5,B004ZKKL5A,"All things Gamera. Let's all sing the song: ""Gamera is really neat, he is made of turtle meat; we all love you, Ga-mer-aaaa!""

4510226,3,B004ZKKL5A,"This is a good ""theme"" collection for real MST3K fans.  For those of general interest it may not be the best collection to  aim for.  The ""Gamera"" movies were never the best that Japan had to offer, even for die hard monster fans such as myself.  I don't know if it is cultural, or the translations, but the films never really sparked my interest.  Joel and the bots do their best and there are good moments, but these were never episodes I watched again and again.  The extras are good and the host segments are up to par, but MST3K was never just ""bad movies being riffed.""  The movies themselves had to have a certain watchability and the Gamera ones, for mew, just never did.",1377388800,,679,4.384

4510245,5,B004ZKKL5A,"Yeah you bought some Gamera VHSs way back when. Then you recorded the Sandy Frank versions from AMC, but scratched your head wondering if your memory was intact because the dubbing was not the way you remember it. Then you bought all the available Alpha Video dvds. But wondered ""Wasn't there a movie called Gamera vs Monster X"" Eventually a company released a full screen version of Gamera vs Monster X as a double feature along with Monster From A Prehistoric Planet. But then something amazing happened. Shout Factory released all the Showa Gamera movies in wonderful widescreen in multible English dubs AND original Japanese spoken language. So after you got all that you breathed a sigh of relief and thought you reached the holy grail of Gamera dvds along comes this new dvd collection called MST3K Vs Gamera. WHAT!?  After Shout Factory did an outstanding job bringing Japanese versions and English dubs of Gamera movies in beautiful widescreen, it would make any rational person ask, Why would Mystery Science Theater 3000 brings us the ""dreadful"" Sandy Frank dubs? Because the Sandy Frank versions are cool in their own way, but at the same time make better fodder for the MST3K crew to pick on.",1358985600,2,1204,4.873170731707317

These are also the Holy Grail Sandy Frank episodes we never thought would make it to DVD. Not only were they combined into this awesome set, plenty of decent DVD extras.

The only thing more sought after is the now ""extinct"" Godzilla vs. Megalon DVD. But quite honestly, the Gamera films are much funnier.",1357430400,,436,4.518987341772152
4510247,5,B004ZKKL5A,"We were MST season 3 fans and on.  Although we caught an episode or two of season 2, season 3 is where it all seemed to come alive.  As a result, we've been frustrated with the collections, which have a season 2, a season 3, one season 7 and one season 9 episode, or a similar mix.

Others have reviewed the CONTENT of this DVD series, but I thought the coherence of style could use a mention.  If you're a Mike-only fan, you probably want to stay away.  This has the full-on goofiness of Joel, including the invention exchange and the sillier skits.  Although Mike's writing is in evidence in every episode, you only see him once or twice and in the special features of his ""Jack Perkins"" bumpers for the MST3K hour that came later.

If you have a nostalgic feel for season 2-4, the early Comedy Channel/Comedy Central seasons, this disk has five shows from season 3, closely related and including the classic callbacks and the tremendous Gamera songs.  It has a great coherence not found in many of the other collections.",1357257600,,1023,4.521739130434782

4510249,4,B004ZKKL5A,"The Gamera movies were an uneven lot-- some so bad that they're good, like the original and Gamera vs. Guiron, and some so bad that they're tedious, like Gamera vs. Gaos. The eternal genius of MST3k just didn't have as much to work with here, but there might have been a certain feeling of obligation to do a lot of Gamera movies, and some of these might not have been chosen if examined on their own merits. Still, very much worth watching and buying. (And yes, I have the cred... I remember when Joel Hodgson did magic tricks at Halloween in some dive in Minneapolis before the show ever started! I wasn't old enough to actually GO, but I remember the ad. There was a big spider in it. And I remember reading in the Strib about the show when it was on KTMA... I thought it sounded stupid and didn't watch it... I've wept such bitter tears over that. Anyway.)

But there's another issue... (kind of afraid to even say anything.) I could not find chapter breaks on any of the DVD's. As far as I can tell, you're stuck with just watching the entire film.

4510261,5,B004ZKKL5A,"Fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000 will definitely want to own this set.  It has it all -- Joel Hodgson on the ""Satellite of Love"" together with his bots produce a running commentary on some of the best worst monster movies Japan ever produced.  There are the annoying little kids running around in secure military installations, foppish police officers, mighty poor dubbing with a general who sounds like Curly of the three stooges and alien women who sound like they're from Indiana. The monsters are the classic Japanese rubber suit variety with an unlikely arsenal of weapons ranging from lasers to a tongue which expels freezing vapors!  Then there is the star of the series: a fire-breathing, jet-propelled, flying prehistoric turtle named Gamera.  He's the friend of the aforesaid annoying children, but not necessarily of Japanese cities as there is usually considerable collateral damage resulting from the battles between the rubber-suit monsters.  Unlike the Godzilla movies which have been ""MSTd"", Gamera does not know karate.  He does, however, do a short gymnastic high bar routine on another planet while doing battle with a monster sporting a knife head.  As I said, this series has it all.",1350086400,,1208,5.13265306122449

Much like the Godzilla series, these movies were meant to be a metaphore of nuclear war.  Until our robot friends get hold of them and butcher then up proper!

Just one of the riffs they do on these movies:  Person in movie:  ""Gamera does not have any weaknesses"". Tom Servo:  ""Except for betting on dogs!""
Purchase this set in it's nice metal shell!  Enjoy the 'bots as they make the boring series watchable and hillarious!",1348272000,,691,4.652892561983471
4510263,5,B004ZKKL5A,MST3K Vs. Gamera is a great collection of Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes. I enjoyed each movie in the set and have to say Joel and the bots are at the top of their riffing game in these episodes. I especially liked the Gamera theme song they came up with in the later episodes. Definitely a set you do not want to pass up!,1344988800,,329,4.15625
4510264,5,B004ZKKL5A,what is there to say about MST3K to those in the know this show is awesome and this set includes all of the Gamera episodes in season 3 of MST3K. They come in a really cool tin box along with some really cool mini posters. MST3K is this really awesome show about this guy marooned in space and forced to watch really bad movies by a mad scientist as an experiment. To fight off the effects of the really bad movies the guy along with Tom Servo and Crow which are robots crack jokes and make comments about the film. MST3K is gone now but for those who enjoy it you should check out Rifftrax its kind of the same thing.,1343692800,,618,4.115702479338843

This was a revelation, and while I'm still a Mike fan, between this and volume 20, I can now more easily see why so many are hardcore Joel fans.

I usually give breakdowns of episodes for these box sets, but this time around, I don't think its needed. They all feature a giant turtle named Gamera who, along with other monsters, wreck up Japan. The set starts out great and gets funnier and funnier culminating in GAMERA VS. GUIRON which is now in my top 10 favorite episodes, and is just behind THE GIRL IN LOVERS LANE as my favorite Joel ep. There is just so much going on in that one. The little kids, the brain eating aliens with southern accents, the absolutely horrific dubbing job (""Hello! Thank you!""), Officer Cornjob, Gamera swinging on the gymnasts beam, the little old-faced girl... I could just go on and on and on. So incredibly perfect.

I just finished watching this and it was a real hoot! If you love those old cheesy monster movies, or making fun of those cheesy old monster movies, MST3k Vs. Gamera is for you!

Gamera is really neat! Gamera is full of meat!  We believe in Gam-er-a!

In general - I love MSTK, Cinematic Titanic and Rifftrax. I have volumes 1-22 of MST3K).
In my opionion - some are better than others. To begin with - I am Not fond of the Gamera movies. I bought this set (MST3K 21 - Standard Edition) with low expectations - and was still disappointed.
The Gamera films in themselves did not interest me on any level, and most of the riffs didn't hit home for me.
I don't know what more Joel and the guys could have done.
I look forward to checking out MST3K-23 in March (2012).
I still love the show and the premise.
This is also available in a Deluxe Edition - which from what I can tell is only different by being in a tin box. And not much for extras on here.
I plan to keep this volume - but only to keep my sets complete (kinda crazy).
I understand - no one hits home runs every time.
If you share my taste - I'd skip this set all together.  Sincerely, Scott M.",1326758400,5,933,4.043243243243243
4510303,5,B004ZKKL5A,"This set is a departure from all previous and recent MST3K DVD set releases in that it contains five episodes all from a single series of movies, Gamera! All five episodes are hosted by show creator, Joel Hodgson and all are from the Comedy Central era of the show. If you've ever wanted to see a robot sing a love song to a turtle or you're a fan of the ""Gameradamerung"" then you must buy this set!

* 302- GAMERA
This 1965 black-and-white film from Daiei studios in Japan was their attempt to cash in on the popularity of a certain other series of films made in Japan about a giant, mutated reptile. While Gamera may be an ersatz Godzilla to some, he's got his own weirdness to recommend him. A nuclear explosion, what else, awakens a giant, mutated, prehistoric flying, fire-breathing turtle from his icy prison to wreak havoc upon the world. A young boy who is especially fond of turtles develops an unusual bond with the monster. The American dubbing and added scenes make the film seem weirder and goofier than ever. This is a must-see episode for all MSTies because of gags like Tom Servo singing ""Tibby Oh Tibby"" and Gamera's visit, played by Mike Nelson, to the SOL via the hexfield view screen. MST3K's riffing machine was in full gear by season three and this is a top-notch episode with hilarious jokes all during the movie and terrific sketches during the host segments as well. This is a contender for the list of top ten all-time greatest episodes.

* 304- GAMERA VS. BARUGON
This is a 1966 follow-up to 1965's Gamera. Barugon is a giant, mutated lizard who shoots a powerful beam of energy from his back. He also has ""ram-tongue"" action. He attacks Japan and Gamera comes to the rescue. It's just that simple and the riffing by Joel and the 'Bots is just that great. The host segment inspired by the film wherein the SOL crew advertise the ""5000-piece fightin' men & monster set"" is phenomenally well done and funny.

* 308- GAMERA VS. GAOS
Gamera was successful in his first two outings so the studio followed up again the next year with Gamera Vs. Gaos in 1967. Gaos is a flying reptile with a wedge-shaped head that shoots high-powered laser beams. Gamera and Gaos chase each other around in a series of monster fights throughout the film. Highlights of this episode include the ""Gameradamerung"" staged by Joel and the 'Bots, the arts and crafts host segment and the final host segment in which they try to come up with a list of other ways to kill Gaos. Again, Gamera inspired the writers at MST3K to do some of their best work, this is hilarious from beginning to end.

* 312- GAMERA VS. GUIRON
This 1969 Gamera film follows the adventures of some young children, two boys and a girl, who discover a flying saucer has landed near their homes. The two boys climb aboard and the ship kidnaps them off to a distant planet. No one will believe the little girl who is left behind. Gamera follows the spaceship and attempts to rescue the boys. The alien planet is inhabited by two attractive alien women who want to eat the boys' brains. They also use their control over the giant monster Guiron to defend their planet from other monsters like Space Gaos and eventually, Gamera. The film features the obligatory fights between actors in rubber monster costumes. Again, the host segments are some of the best ever in the show's history, with Joel and the 'Bots singing the ""Gamera song"" and then Michael Feinstein (played by Mike Nelson) singing it in Deep 13 in the final host segment.

* 316- GAMERA VS. ZIGRA
Gamera returns in 1971 to take on an alien monster called Zigra. Zigra attacks Earth's moon base then comes to Earth spreading destruction in an attempt to dominate the planet. As usual, small children are involved and are an integral part of saving the Earth with help from our eponymous hero, Gamera the fire-breathing flying turtle. Oh, and one of the children really likes Coca-Cola. Episode highlights include the scale model of Gamera and the different ways to sing the Gamera song. Though some of the writers have complained about how much they hated these movies over the years, you wouldn't know it from watching this or any other Gamera episode of the show. This one's as funny as all the others and that's really saying something. This episode nicely ends the MST3K foray into the world of Gamera and leaves you wishing there were more.

The extra features for this set are:
* So Happy Together: A Look Back at MST3K and Gamera
* Gamera Vs. The Chiodo Brothers
* Gamera Obscura: A Brief History by August Ragone (author of Eiji Tsuburaya: Master of Monsters)
* Original Japanese Trailers
* 5 limited edition mini-posters by artist Steve Vance
* MST Hour wraps for ""Gamera"" and ""Gamera Vs. Guiron""

Let's face it, unless you are a fan of MST3K and/or Gamera, you probably won't find this collection particularly amusing.  I happen to be a huge fan of both ergo my 5 star rating for this product.

I only have one piece of advice: if you do buy this product, make sure to keep the box the DVDs come in.  Don't do something like allow your four year old to use it as a stepping stone for the sofa.  These DVDs come in thin cases that don't stand alone very well, so the box is pretty necessary to keep the collection intact.

The riffs, the sketches, the invention exchange, all gold; this is the MST team at the height of their powers, with some of the best raw material any riffer could want in the form of five of the most badly-acted, poorly-dubbed rubber monster suit extravaganzas ever to lurch shudderingly forth from a Japanese studio.

Curiously no apparent damage was done to the cardboard box it was shipped in. (Huh?) I requested a replacement, and Amazon got one to me in 24 hours. UNBELIEVABLE! (I suggest Amazon use a larger sturdier box for this item in the future.) Others have given ample info on the movies. Here's my two cents:

I LOVE MST3K!
I LOVE Giant Monster Movies! (Kaiju)
I SPECIFICALLY love Gamera. I believe it is not possible to describe the concept of Gamera to the uninitiated without a smile coming to your face. Example:
""He's a giant flying jet propelled monster turtle that defends the Earth from other monsters. Oh, and he loves children..."" Numerous versions of all the Gamera movies are available on Amazon. I own most of them. Some releases are good (Shout Factory are the standouts), and some are...not so much.

I have not watched all of the MST versions of these movies, so I am very very happy they are being released in this set. I have seen snippets of each, and have laughed myself silly on numerous occasions. I specifically love the Gamera theme songs:
""Gamera is really neat, Gamera is filled with Meat, We're all eating Gamera.""

Giant Monsters and MST3K are a match made in heaven! My very favorite MST3K episdode is Godzilla Versus Megalon. After this Gamera set, I pray that the Gods of confusing licensing agreements find a way to allow that to become legally available.

I am updating this review as I watch all the movies.
Disk 1: Gamera: Very good Episode with an excellent Behind the scenes featurette. Trace never heard of Gamera before MST? Unbelieveable!
Disk 2: Gamera Vs Barugon. Good Episode but the movie is so plodding...the MST treatment saves it. Excellent extras for fans of Kaiju and Gamera.
Disk 3: Gamera vs. Gyaos: MUCH BETTER THAN DISK 2! Excellent extras!
Disk 4: Gamera Vs. Guiron: Five Stars! Features First Gamera Theme song! Contains MST3k Hour bumpers, but no real meaty extras. Don't need em! This is the highlight of the set so far!
Disk 5: Gamera Vs. Zigra: Four and a half stars. Hard to top Gamera versus Guiron, but still a very good episode. Disk is again light on extras. That's just fine! VERY GOOD SET OVERALL! I AM VERY PLEASED! WOOT!",1312329600,14,2346,4.659420289855072

4510336,5,B004ZKKL5A,"Judge Erich Asperschlager, DVD Verdict-- Mystery Science Theater 3000: Volume XXI, MST3K vs. Gamera is a big deal, and Shout! Factory has given it the royal treatment. Five episodes instead of the standard four, all dedicated to one series of movies, and packaged in a handsome embossed collector's tin with mini posters and a sweet slate of extras. The brouhaha is fitting considering how closely the fates of Gamera and Mystery Science Theater 3000 are linked. He made his first monstrous appearance during the show's initial season on the local KTMA station, back when the riffs were all improvised and the budget was nil. That the show decided to revisit all five Gamera movies after making the jump to Comedy Central underlines a fondness not only for this particular turtle, but for the kind of ripping good schlock that inspired Joel Hodgson and his pals to create the series in the first place.

Mystery Science Theater 3000: Volume XXI, MST3K vs. Gamera marks Shout! Factory's second all-Joel set in a row. Mike superfans can take solace, though, in the fact that he shows up a lot in the host segments--in turns as Gamera, Kenny, and lounge singer Michael Feinstein, who plays a stirring Deep 13 piano rendition of ""The Gamera Song"" before getting clubbed over the head.

The audio-visual quality of these episodes stands up with the others Shout! has released. There's a split-second tracking issue near the end of Gamera vs. Gaos, but otherwise they look as good as can be expected for a twenty-plus year old cable series shot on tape. I'm saying you don't need to worry about a Blu-ray double dip; the closest MST3K will ever get to hi-def is the occasional Helen Keller joke.

Provided you don't mind a good bit of ribbing at the expense of our Japanese brethren--especially the ones in short pants and rubber monster suits--MST3K vs. Gamera is tons of fun. Shout! Factory has outdone themselves with this collection, and fans shouldn't hesitate to reward them (and themselves) by picking it up on day one. Although none of the episodes reach the dizzying comedic heights of Season Three classics like Pod People and Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, this is a rock solid set from beginning to end. The waiting is over, MST3K fans! Hell has frozen over, and it tastes like chicken.

4510337,5,B004ZKKL5A,"Ok, so it doesn't come out for another couple of months, but every MST3K set from Shout Factory thus far has been superb, with lots of great extras and awesome packaging, and this one has ALL of the Gamera MST3K episodes!  Finally, all of the Gamera theme songs sung by Joel and the bots, and Tom's ode to Tibby, and the unforgettable Cornjob and the Bicycle Song, all on DVD together at last!

Themed follow-up release suggestion: the remainder of the MST3K episodes featuring Japanese films or TV shows that can be licensed, all as one set.",1306886400,6,542,4.577319587628866
4510338,2,B004ZKKL5A,"Compared to the boxed sets in the past this one comes up short.  I sense the end is near for this grand repackaging run, and I can only shudder in fear of what's in store for Misty fans when they start rolling out the Blu-rays.  My main complaints for this boxed set is the lack of any collectible and the relatively high price (though I'm sure this is due to licensing).  Will somebody please smell the coffee and get this show back on the air, the merchandising end of it is working better than most shows that have been running for ten years!

I'll buy this boxed set so I can have all of them, but this will be a hard one to swallow.",1305849600,10,637,4.112903225806452
4510339,5,B004ZKKL5A,"Shout Factory once again shocked the world by obtaining the rights to the entire Gamera MST3K series ! Volume 21 - MST3K vs. Gamera is the first 5 DVD set containing all the Gamera movies done during the shows 3rd season. Season three is where MST3K really began to take off...

Episode 302 - GAMERA - a fantastic entry in the series...this is a great episode..great riffs, Tom Servo singing Tibby, Oh Tibby with Crow getting involved, Joel's salad invention, Mike Nelson as Gamera plus that old expression "" A whole lot "" more...
In Japan, Gamera was created by rival Toho company Daiei to compete with Godzilla. And just like the first Godzilla, this film was shot in crisp black and white. Arguably this wasn't a bad film at all, and is considered one of the big 3 in the Gamera series. The premise of the boy who loves Gamera can be a little silly but as far as a story and special effects go, this was a notch about the others...

Episode 304 - Gamera vs. Barugon - the amazing sequel to Gamera has our child friendly turtle escape his imprisonment ( the Z plan from the first film) to face Barugon. Barugon is a unique creation with his rainbow rays, and his giant tongue which is used for a battering ram and can exhale cold, rendering everything and everyone frozen.
Another fantastic episode with fun inventions & segments ( the monster set sketch was awesome) Tom asks Joel where was Gamera during this film...the answer is actually, on the cutting room floor as the MST3K version does edit the initial fight scene between Gamera and Barugon. For those like me that have seen this film in its NON MST3K version we have all seen where Gamera gets frozen by Barguon in their first battle. In the MST version we just see Gamera frozen...Still, the movie is for the MST3K viewer not so much a die hard Gamera fan to say "" hey that scene is missing!""

Episode 308 - Gamera vs. Gaos - The wildest Gamera film of the series..the story was solid - the effects were great overall - Gamera fights Daiei'a answer to Toho's Rodan - Gaos - which is basically a flying bat that shoots laser beams that split cars in half and tears into Gamera's flesh. This was a bloody Gamera film, but not meant to nauseate the audience..
This made another great MST3K episode -  the Lucille Ball segment at the beginning, the Gameradamerung sketch..This was yet another episode that brought the show to new heights...the film and the episode was great if you ask me..

Episode 312 Gamera vs. Guiron - This Gamera entree was actually part of the decline in the series due to budget constraints, bad dubbing and making Gamera the friend of all children, thus becoming a kiddie flick. Gamera fights Guiron, a giant knife like creature on another planet. Gamera goes to another planet to rescue two children who accidentally go into a spaceship and fly off the face of the Earth with it. As awful as the film is - you bet that it did not stop Joel & the Bots , Dr. F and TVs Frank from putting together another fabulous episode. This film has the Gamera song which led to Joel and the Bots doing their rendition of the song "" Gamera is really neat, he is filled with turtle meat"" ..we get Mike Nelson as Michael Feinstein also discussing the Gamera song..
These Gamera episodes really brought out the best work , part of the reason that not only are these episodes were highly sought after, but just about everything from Season 3 for that matter....

Episode 316- Gamera vs. Zigra - The grand finale of the MST3K Gamera series has Gamera fighting Zigra. Zigra is a spaceship that turns into a giant fish like creature who wants to take over the Earth because the people of the Earth are polluting it. The center of this story is of course the kids..with one of the girls- Helen always seeming to want a Coca-Cola
There's a party on the SOL because its the last Gamera experiment ..more hilarity with Tom and Crow showing Joel the insides of Gamera, more Gamera songs including a well done finale on the SOL as well as Deep 13 as Dr. F lets his hair down and goes metal on us all...

As reported on Satellite News - the features on this set include.
* So Happy Together: A Look Back at MST3K and Gamera
* Gamera Vs. The Chiodo Brothers
* Gamera Obscura: A Brief History by August Ragone (author of Eiji Tsuburaya: Master of Monsters)
* Original Japanese Trailers
* 5 limited edition mini-posters by artist Steve Vance
* MST Hour wraps for ""Gamera"" and ""Gamera Vs. Guiron""
* This special deluxe edition comes in a collectible tin box.

All I can say is WOW, this is a dream come true for myself and all the MST3K fans - these were supposed to be "" it will never happen"" episodes but , here they are..causing quite a buzz...
And now having seen all 5 episodes on the DVD set, the transfers are outstanding, the menus are great with Gamera walking through the doorway sequence. All of the bonus features were good/ enlightening.
Overall this set is just outstanding !  HIGHLY recommended !
Thank you Shout Factory !!",1305504000,54,4991,4.475824175824176

8450183,5,B004ZKKL5A,"I've always been a fan of Gamera movies and long a fan of MST3K. This set is fantastic. The riffing is excellent and the host segments are hilarious. (Gameradamerung anyone.)

This set is becoming increasingly hard to get due to rights issues. So get it while you can before it disappears like volumes 10 and 14.

First rate.",1504310400,,325,4.586206896551724

I kicked myself for not buying this before it got expensive, but now I have no more reason to kick myself! All of the movies will be watched quite a lot of times, as (just like almost all MST3K I've seen) they have great, non-stop fun. The Master would approve.",1491609600,2,404,4.1923076923076925

8450189,5,B004ZKKL5A,"You can't go wrong with a cheesy movie marathon of Gamers vs. everyone! He is a friend to all children. He doesn't even get embarrassed about their badly dubbed voices and their upsetting shorts. What a guy. Seriously, it's good stuff. So buy it.",1463875200,,246,4.613636363636363
8450190,1,B004ZKKL5A,"Great product but not for $120.
