8306573,1,1632503743,"Disappointed with this purchase- very basic and included many poor choices when working with metal clay. I read several reviews on different sites so I bought this thinking I would learn something new. I learned not to do many of the things done in this video. If you are serious about metal clay and learning how to work with it, avoid purchasing this video.",1498608000,,359,4.625
