8245270,5,B0012DUDC4,"Experiencing Italy was fun to watch. The music is excellent, the photography first rate, and the narration entertaining. The section on how to get train and bus tickets was helpful. I wish it was a bit longer, however, the bonus features made up for that. I like the young people who made this DVD and of course I love Italy. Great job.",1297036800,,336,4.435483870967742
