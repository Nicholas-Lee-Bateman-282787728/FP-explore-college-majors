Rainbau is perhaps good at what she does; but I don't like the lack of instruction in this video. She rarely mentions the names of the poses she is doing/about to do, and moves one into the other without prompting; if I wasn't looking at the screen I easily missed it. I have only done a few of the segments a few times not sure if i even want to try the others yet.
This isn't really a 'true' yoga tape, but more for flexibility and stretching exercises including ones that I was doing in 6th grade gym class which later ended up to put you at risk for knee injuries.
I really liked the idea of a 10 min yoga workout to warm up/cool down from my other workouts; but I have heard good reviews about the '10 minute' series; I think I will try that instead.",1389571200,17,886,4.187134502923977
8616483,2,B00FKTCZD6,"As mentioned in other reviews, this is best of you're already familiar with yoga. The instructor is annoying because she fumbles her words and obviously didn't rehearse this. I'd recommend just watching the screen and turning instructor off. Some good stretches and that's about it...",1489708800,,284,5.333333333333333
