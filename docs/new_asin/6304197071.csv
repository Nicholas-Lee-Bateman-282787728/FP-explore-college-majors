810802,5,6304197071,"If you are to young to have ever seen Burns & Allen
you can catch up with this zany review of their TV
shows.  Gracie was a comic genius and plays her
straightman George like a fiddle.
For the old fans this best of disc will bring back
a lot of happy memories.",1222387200,31,260,3.9056603773584904
810803,3,6304197071,"8 shows, last about 3+ hours...black and white...throw back to old times...inane humor....the carnation milk ads and jingles playing over and over get on the nerves---solved by fast forward. nothing much to be excited over, mildly entertaining-old old jokes, dated humor, no real laughs",1199404800,,286,5.5227272727272725
810804,5,6304197071,"Seeing Burns and Allen comically collaborate with each other is obviously an enjoyable experience.  What is also interesting for those not that familiar with early 1950s TV advertising was the way in which ""Carnation Milk"" (the show's sponser) was worked into many of the episodes.  The show's ""announcer"", (often it was Harry von Zell) would drop by the house and engage in a 2-minute discussion with the other characters about the benefits of Carnation milk. To modern sensibilities it can often seem jarring, but in some instances the writers manage to work in this commercial plug in an entertaining enough fashion.  The DVD features a variety of shows taken from different seasons, so you also get a sense of how the character of Harry Morton (Burns and Allen's next door neighbor) was played by different actors.",1182902400,48,818,5.0
810805,5,6304197071,"As a fan of Old Time Radio shows I was very familiar with George and Gracie's radio program.  I had never seen the TV program until I picked up this set of videos and was pleasantly surprised to learn that they are even better than the radio program which is one of my favorites ever.  I won't trouble with plot summaries, because I can't do that nearly as well as what's already been done.  If you're already a fan of George and Gracie, you're sure to love these episodes, and if you've never experienced them, this is a great place to start!",980640000,8,543,4.303921568627451

810966,5,6304197071,"When you are ready for some wonderful old fashioned entertainment then you'll want to watch this DVD. Its style and content brings you back to a different era when comedy was simple, quaint and honest. George Burns always the perfect straight man and Gracie so absolutely adorable with her quick and perfectly efficient quips. Then add a dose of Ed Sullivan-like talent spots in between segments.  George and Gracie were a perfectly matched couple and it makes me smile to just write of them. ""Say goodnight, Gracie....goodnight.""",1391385600,,530,5.091954022988506
810997,5,6304197071,"I personally think Burns & Allen were the funniest people ever on stage. Perfect for ""G"" rated hilarious humor that won't offend anyone.

810998,5,6304197071,"Bought for my husband I have watched most so far. Growing up Burns and Allen was on in reruns every morning before school. It helped to start the day with laughter rather than tears. Gracie was my favorite. My father always said of her ""she has to be really smart to play dumb so well"". This set was done with the shows just as they were originally seen commercials and all which were part of the show. Everyone should see these for the humor and historic television value.",1380931200,,473,4.386363636363637

811000,5,6304197071,"I never saw this on TV back when it was on but my wife bought this show recently and we thought it was hilarious. This show has stood the test of time. It's a shame that nothing on the major networks even during Prime time is suitable for a family to watch together. If I had children I'd be afraid to let them watch the trash on today....come to think of it, that's most likely the problem with most of the kids today.",1370304000,3,419,4.0602409638554215

811004,1,6304197071,This dvd isn't as bad as Vol 2 at least I could see the picture but it isn't anything to purchase due to quality of picture.  I watched it because I am a Burns and Allen fan!,1350086400,2,174,3.7027027027027026
811005,4,6304197071,"These are great episodes...poor quality, but good enough
to sit and enjoy. I am a big fan of Classic TV. And a lot
of it is now on DVD; which is good because you never know how
long you will be able to watch it on antenna tv. I am so ready
for the second season of MAUDE to come out as well. :)",1340496000,,294,3.609375
811006,5,6304197071,"These early episodes of the popular TV show are simply a delight to watch. I've been watching the show on the local channel Antennae TV, which has been airing the later episodes that are more polished in quality. It's interesting to see how the show morphed during its run, surviving cast changes (Harry Von Zell replacing Bill Goodwin as announcer; multiple actors playing neighbor Harry Morton), format changes (the early ones have sponsor Carnation Milk plugging their product like crazy), and even a new on-air ""home"" set for George & Gracie.
But the show's biggest asset was always George & Gracie themselves. George was the relaxed straight man, puffing on his trademark cigar, and breaking the ""fourth wall"" as he monologued directly to the audience about the latest plot point or his vaudeville days. Wry in personality & dry in humor, he could do more with less like the old pro he was. And then, there was the incomparable Gracie, who managed to make her ""dumb Dora"" role unique & endearing. As zany as her responses were, often misunderstanding a phrase or sentence & turn it on its ear, she would work what George termed her ""illogical logic"" beautifully. Although she appeared ""confused"", she was probably the sharpest tack in the room.
This is definitely a time capsule of vintage TV, as networks would dare not write product placement directly into their scripts (can you imagine trying that today with the thousands of products out there? It was a simpler time back then!).
An enjoyable 8 episodes with undoubtedly the world's greatest husband-and-wife comedy team!",1329436800,5,1581,4.969811320754717
811037,5,6304197071,"Classic comedy never grows old. Sony's excellent  compilation of ""The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show"" makes you wonder why the entire series (which ran from 1950 to 1958) has not warranted a DVD release. The VHS set features six hilarious episodes, with ""Columbia Pictures Doing Burns and Allen Story"" (1954) a particular standout. Shot in 35mm, the unedited prints look terrific. A landmark program from the Golden Age of Television.",1321920000,,438,5.169014084507042
811038,3,6304197071,"I was surprised that several episodes were really old!! I had no idea that there were several  actors that played Blanche's husband, Harry. The older episodes weren't as entertaining: First episode is obviously set up like a play on stage. The constant Carnation Milk promotions throughout several episodes got on my nerves. However it was interesting to see the transition from very old to newer episodes. A bit of ""Burns and Allen"" history so I'm glad to have it.

The Burns and Allen act is still funny!

I was extremely pleased with the seller. The DVD arrived at my house much sooner than expected!",1311120000,2,603,4.778846153846154
811039,2,6304197071,"If you're a real George and Gracie fan, then this is not the video for you.  I was really disappointed. There are far better Burns and Allen shows that could have easily been reproduced. There were some skits that used to bowl me over and all the sigments in this video do not even come close.",1301097600,2,293,4.232142857142857
811040,4,6304197071,"For nearly 40 years, Burns & Allen were stars of vaudeville, radio, TV, and film.  Even after Gracie passed away in 1964, George still seemed to keep the spirit of her character alongside as a silent partner to his solo/straight-man routine.  Here is one of the few wife-husband partnerships that worked well in public and private.  Few comedy shows since have equalled George and Gracie - none have surpassed them. I would have given this dvd set a higher rating but; 1)only 8 of over 200 episodes are here and 2)these shows can actually get old should you watch them every day for a month.  But who had time to do that?",1275264000,2,621,4.517857142857143

811042,5,6304197071,"I'm too young to have heard them on radio or seen them on TV when their shows originally aired, but I fell in love with this team the moment I first saw the reruns.  Gracie is simply marvelous and George is sheer perfection as her straight man.  How they didn't crack up during their performances is beyond me.  Since Amazon's site lacks an episode list for this DVD, here you go:

1. Dance Lessons
2. Harry Morton's Secretary
3. Gracie's Car Accident
4. Free Trip To Hawaii
5. Beverly Hills Uplift Society
6. Home Wedding
7. Teen Age Space Girls
8. Gracie's Bank Account

811044,5,6304197071,I was very happy with this DVD.  It is very much worth buying if your a new or old fan or the worlds funniest husband and wife team. I recommend this DVD to any others being offered on Amazon. You get the value of what you spent buying it. Although the menu options are quite poor it doesnt matter b/c the shows themselves are so good. They just don't make shows like these anymore. Many of the other DVD's being offered on  the Burns and Allen show on this site are NOT worth purchasing. GET THIS ONE!!!,1241308800,61,504,4.185567010309279
811045,5,6304197071,"I absolutely loved these episodes...each one is funnier than the last. The comedy of Gracie Allen is timeless, so that even teenagers will appreciate it.

There are 2 half hour episodes per tape, 3 tapes in the collection, so only a total of 6 episodes, when they could have fit 12 at SP speed. Nevertheless, the quality is very good considering how old these eps are. I wish there were more available on DVD or VHS. I do not understand why they are not since these old eps are in the public domain (as far as I know). Unfortunately, Burns and Allen are no longer shown on TV reruns. Television has truly become a vast wasteland.

Do yourself and your family a favor by buying these timeless treasures before they run out, as they may never again be available.",1240358400,2,760,4.460431654676259
