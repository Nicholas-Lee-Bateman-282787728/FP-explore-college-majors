8040332,5,B00068S3NW,"I stumbled upon this movie after watching The Big Green. The duo of Renna and Leopardi is nothing short of comedic genious. This movie was filmed throughout the mid 90's to the early 2000's, as the producers worked tirelessly to perfect this masterpiece that would define a generation!

Beau Bridges Oscar-worthy performance as ''Mario's Dad'' comments nicely on the theme of fatherhood. Although his appearances  were limited, the catharsis provided by his character causes the viewer to re-examine their own paternal relationship.

The movie opens in Los Angeles where a random boy frantically races through a wooded area as flashbacks of the previous 20 minutes play out before the viewer has the slightest chance of understanding what is unfolding before their eyes. Although we assume the boy in the woods and the boy in the flashbacks are the same character, this is never made clear since each boy is clearly played by a different actor. The story focuses around young Mario, valiantly portrayed by Chauncey Leopardi, who is sent to live with his aunt/mother's best friend in San Francisco (plothole#1) after his father receives a promotion causing him to relocate to Phoenix. It is during this move that you will notice blatant changes in Mario's appearance. These changes include constant changes in length of hair between scenes although no time has elapsed. The appearance and disappearance of an earring in his left ear and a general cycle of aging and reverse aging of himself and other characters even though the film follows one uninterupted timeline. This phenomena occurs throughout the entire movie (plotholes 2,3 and 4).

Upon arrival there is much friction between Mario and his cousin/mom's friend's son. Even though his father is clearly in the opening and closing scenes, at one point in the movie it is referenced that his father is actually dead and it is in fact his mother that has sent him to San Francisco, but at the beginning of the movie it is assumed that the mother is out of the picture. This enormous plothole is exacerbated by the appearance of both his mother and father in the closing scenes.  Although both parents appear in the closing scenes, they never actually appear in the same frame or embrace or communicate in any way. This leads me to believe that there were was a change in the storyline that was never completely followed through likely due to budget restrictions and the inability to re-shoot scenes (plothole #6).

The next day, Mario's cousin/mom's best friend's son takes him to the local Boys Klub where he is shunned by his cousin/mom best friend's son and his friends, however it is this seemingly bad stroke of luck that leads Mario to meet a gang of losers who will become his best friends. Countless plotholes occur throughout the remainder of the film including multiple showings of the same scene and the random entrance of irrelevant characters but I invite you to discover these gems for yourself as I do not want to give away the entire plot of this scrumtralescent viewing experience.",1391817600,2,3052,4.939571150097466
8040333,5,B00068S3NW,"Admittedly, this is very much a kids movie, a preteen movie.  However, it is fun and entertaining, and contains many little wholesome lesson in life.  For those who aren't Catholic, the Salesian order of priests, started by Fr. Don Bosco over a hundred years ago, has as one of their main mission the Christian education and training of boys.  This great order was involved in the making of this movie, so it comes as no surprise that the priest in this movie is a loving and wise priest.  (It is refreshing to see a priest in a recent movie who isn't violating his vows or molesting children.)

In one sense, this is just another underdog misfits overcomes the super team movie.  But the lessons are in how it is done.  First, Mario finds acceptance in the group of so-called losers.  They have their adventures related to the 'Boys Klub' until Fr. Sal challenges them to enter the local basketball tournament.  They then have to learn real teamwork.  First, they have to raise the $1,000 needed to enter the tournament.  They try to raise it by questionable means at first, but they are not allowed to keep the money they raised.  After a sad day trying to wash cars, their janitor-coach takes them to a used car dealer where they do raise the money washing the cars there.  When the money is stolen, they chase the thief down to get it back; but when they find out that his children and wife are hungry, they give him the money because it is more important to help the poor than to be in a basketball tournament.

The whole movie is full of little lessons in character like this that traditonal values parents can point out to their children as they watch the film.",1150243200,4,1668,4.498338870431894
