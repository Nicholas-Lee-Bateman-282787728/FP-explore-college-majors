8528713,4,B008KR4VXW,These were not the scary kind.  Old movies of stars when they first started out.  Good movies just not haunted films. Some have a twist to them.  Fun to watch on a Saturday afternoon.,1378166400,,183,4.323529411764706
8528714,2,B008KR4VXW,"When Miramax/Dimension Films had their nasty divorce from Disney, the Weinsteins sold their titles to different companies; mainly Lionsgate and Echo Creek Entertainment.  Two of their titles are included in this pack; The Night Listener and The Nameless and both are very poor quality transfers.  Both have nearly zero sharpness visibility and the color is all but washed out and I'm nearly positive that the aspect ratio is wrong for The Night Listener.  Luckily both of the aforementioned films are still available in their own individual units with no visible problems.  The other four titles in this set range from (entertainment wise) watchable to slightly interesting.

*I should point out that both The Night Listener and The Nameless are here under the Echo Creek logo so it should come as no surprise to anyone owning a DVD from them the problems that litter their titles.  Lionsgate continues to take extremely good care of their titles and provide the kind of discs their fans demand.  Why the Weinsteins chose to sell their films to such an inferior company is an insult to movie lovers.",1354492800,6,1099,4.972677595628415
