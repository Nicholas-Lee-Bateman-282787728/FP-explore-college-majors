2521726,5,B000EJPG4C,Grew up in South Dakota (as did my wife) ... the Black Hills (which includes Rushmore and Crazy Horse) are very special - been there many times.  We are planning a big family reunion there - ordered the video to check it out as we will likely purchase more so we can send each of our family invitees an idea of what there is to see there.  Lived up to our high expectations - highly recommend.,1383868800,,393,4.157894736842105
2521727,4,B000EJPG4C,"This film covers the most attractive scenic spots in the region of Black Hills. These include Mount Rushmore, Crazy Horse, Wind Cave, Jewel Cave, Badlands, Devils Tower, Custer State Park and Mammoth Site. Generally speaking, the strength of this film is the coverage of Black Hills rather than the depth or the story behind it.

Most emphasis is on Mount Rushmore. You can see majestic footages of the four presidents carved on the mount. The narration for the story of Mount Rushmore is adequate. The reason to choose Jefferson, however, is not accurate. The main reason is the Louisiana Purchase, which is never mentioned in this film. Since this is a tour guide type film, don't expect the depth as the similar one released by THC or PBS.

Custer State Park and Crazy Horse also share decent run time of this film. The focus of Custer State Park is the wild life such as bisons and prairie dogs. Crazy Horse is another story of carving the rock, which is even tougher than Mount Rushmore. Similar to Mount Rushmore, the screen shots are good but the depth is the last to expect.

Other scenic spots are covered briefly, about 3 to 5 minutes for each.

I've been to all these sites during the past 3 years. I think the arrangement and sharing for the total run time is well-organized. If you've never been to Black Hills before, it may be a good idea to plan your trip according to this film.

Touring Black Hills is one of my best sightseeing memories and I'm glad to see there is a film covering all these. It is not only good for an introduction, but a review after you've been there as well. You can even send this as a gift to whomever is interested in touring Black Hills, before or after.",1185062400,13,1698,4.5
