3644277,5,B001HUHBD6,"This is one of the most well written comedies to grace TV.  The acting is wonderful and the crazy characters believable. The program has lived up to expectations from the first season. John Becker is the Grinch of the medical profession and Reggie, Bob, Linda, Margaret and Jake the perfect foils!",1420761600,,297,4.823529411764706

3644285,5,B001HUHBD6,It is a pleasure to be able to build a collection of favorites from the past to fit into those times when there seems to be nothing of interest on television.,1394496000,,158,4.129032258064516
3644286,5,B001HUHBD6,"I received this DVD within 3 days and the quality was superb. I would highly recommend this seller to anybody that wants a great purchase. The show is absolutely hilarious and has so many great characters to feed off of. Loved Ted Danson in Cheers and he does an exceptional job portraying somebody that is so different from the role of Sam Malone.
 I recommend this show that loves truly well written comedy.",1376697600,,409,4.602739726027397
3644287,5,B001HUHBD6,"Love the show, the cast if characters, how angry John Becker was...the changes that they made were okay, I like Nancy Travis but I loved the Reggie character!!!",1372464000,,160,4.75
3644288,4,B001HUHBD6,"This season is a solid follow up to the first.  Becker actually gets involved in a relationship in this season and he nearly gets murdered.  Which I guess is no huge surprise.  There's also plenty of Jake, Reggie, Margaret and Linda.  I think the dinner party episode might be my favorite from this season.",1369440000,,306,4.611111111111111
3644289,5,B001HUHBD6,Its Becker at his best...the D v d 's  work great in my machine..  Thought it was a little to high in pricing.,1362441600,,110,3.739130434782609
3644290,5,B001HUHBD6,"My son started watching Becker when he was 11 and an older neighbor kid said, ""You let him watch that???""  I didn't really watch tv then, but now it's one of my favorite shows.  It's funny of course, but there is a lot of common sense that gets conveyed in many of the episodes, and underlying it all is a message that you can be a selfish, angry chain smoker and still have redeemable qualities.  You come away thinking, ""If Becker is an okay guy, there's probably hope for all the rest of us.""  Or, something like that.  I usually just watch it to fall asleep.",1354060800,,562,4.264150943396227
3644291,3,B001HUHBD6,"I bought a 3 disk set for the second season of Becker. I am sure it is just a fluke, as it came in a timely
manner and was packaged just fine. But only the 1st and 3rd disk work. the second disk (8 episodes) doesn't work in
any of my players and I tried it in all 3. I have no idea how to contact the seller other than this way, the feedback
button.",1344729600,,349,3.6666666666666665
3644292,5,B001HUHBD6,This is the complete second season.  It comes in a pretty standard dvd set box.  Other than that I don't think there's much to say.  With Becker you either like it or you don't.  I won't recommend him to just anybody cuz the humor varies greatly.  But he's like one of the first versions of House.,1325030400,,297,4.232142857142857
3644293,5,B001HUHBD6,"I see that the first 3 seasons of Becker are the only seasons available. Where are Seasons 4, 5, & 6?? This sitcom ran for 6 Seasons. Oh but we have Seinfeld coming out of our ears. Never cared for Seinfeld and felt it was way overrated. Becker more or less went unnoticed and underrated. I thought finally that Ted Danson had found his niche in this sitcom.",1324512000,2,358,4.279411764705882
3644294,5,B001HUHBD6,Very thankful I was able to find the product through Amazon. Keep buying stuff from Buy.com that I find useless after I receive them. Amazon.com always comes to the rescue.,1304985600,,172,4.766666666666667
3644295,5,B001HUHBD6,If you wanna laugh this show is for you.  Ted Danson plays disgruntled Dr. John Becker to a T.  And the ensemble cast that tolerates him will have you in stitches.,1277510400,,163,4.225806451612903
3644296,5,B001HUHBD6,"Everybody thought ""House M.D."" was such an original show when it debuted in 2004 with its wise-cracking sarcastic Dr. Gregory House. Though this was more of a drama, nobody seemed to realize that Ted Danson is the one who made that popular, way back in 1998 as Dr. John Becker.

""Becker"" is one of the funniest shows ever to hit TV, but sadly some casting changes and other behind-the-scenes squabbling brought the show to a slow demise after about six seasons. Ted Danson gives some of his best work here. If you think the rants of Dr. Cox on ""Scrubs"" are funny, just wait until Becker storms into his office ranting about the bums on the street, the city health department, the justice system, humanity in general or any one the upteen-million things that seem to make him angry.

The true heart of this show is it's sheer originality and unique characters - Becker's dim-witted female assistant, Linda, could have been a walking cliche were she portrayed by a busty blond, instead she's portrayed by the raven-haired Shawnee Smith (of ""Saw"" fame) with perfect comedic timing; Margaret is Dr. Becker's nurse, a heavy-set Bible-thumping black woman who is the perfect opposite of Becker's in-your-face sarcasm, anger and rants against God and religion; then there's Jake, Becker's blind best friend who, although he becomes the butt of many jokes, holds his own as one of the show's leading men; there's Reggie, the middle-aged ex-model turned diner owner who can't get a date despite her drop-dead gorgeous looks; and Bob, the fast talking nitwit who annoys everyone yet manages to remain an appealing part of the show. Other characters constantly move in and out of the show with many famous stars making guest appearances.

Naturally ""Becker"" falls prey to many common sitcom gags and it's formula never really changes, which makes it a bit redundant after a while. Still, it's not one to miss!",1264723200,2,1898,4.888198757763975
3644297,5,B001HUHBD6,I enjoy Becker so much but our area no longer airs them. I was happy to be able to purchase the DVD's of the show. I only wish all the seasons were available.,1261526400,,158,3.8181818181818183
3644298,5,B001HUHBD6,"A modern sitcom that was great. If they hadn't moved it @ so much, and if they'd kept Terry Ferrell it would have lasted a lot longer. Also with Becker and Reggie dating off and on. I recieved it fast and in great shape.",1255564800,,220,4.0227272727272725
3644299,5,B001HUHBD6,"As usual, Becker is a fun series. It's a pity there's no extras on these releases, but I guess I should be happy, they're even released on DVD.",1248134400,,143,4.142857142857143
3644300,4,B001HUHBD6,i am trying to order the entire seares but can/t get loged on don c,1247270400,,67,3.533333333333333
3644301,5,B001HUHBD6,"Ted Danson is brilliant as the edgey Dr. Becker, who would rather rant and rave about EVERYTHING in his world than see the good all around him.  Ya just gotta love Becker.... he's all the crabby people in your life rolled into one character and you can laugh yourself silly as you listen to his continual tirades..... but, then there are those endearing moments when he lets his softer side show, but only when no one else is looking but the audience.... just brilliantly portrayed by Danson and kudos to all the rest of the cast too!",1247011200,4,534,4.505154639175258

3644304,5,B001HUHBD6,"As many times as I've watched Becker Season 1 and now Season 2 on DVD, I still burst out laughing in every episode. Becker was one of the best TV sitcom series ever, and I would liked to have seen it continue for a few years longer.  The writers never seemed to run out of hilarious material & the characters were all so perfectly cast.  I loved them all.
