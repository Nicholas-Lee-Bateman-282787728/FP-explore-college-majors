1944020,5,B0000TPA6K,It is finally on its way here and with deleted scenes!!!  Roswell is quite possably the greatest show EVER and now can come in to your own home yeah!!  Season 1 was great and they all just keep getting better. (maybie you cant tell but i just found out about the release and im really excited!!) It is the best show ever and i highly recomend it to everyone.,1066867200,5,358,4.173913043478261
1944021,5,B0000TPA6K,"The news I have been waiting for since season 1 aired has finally come from Antarians.com!!! I am so happy that the dvd is finally being released. I am looking forward to all those special features, esp. the commentary. Hopefully, the commentaries will clarify why they did certain plots and scenes...
Now I just hope that sales are good enough for a season 2 and season 3 release!!!",1066780800,7,383,4.647058823529412
1944022,5,B0000TPA6K,"I've loved Roswell ever since I saw the first show and am preordering it now. It had everything: well developed plots, deep characters, and great actors. I'm sad that the networks never really gave it a chance, it was hard to catch for a while with all the moving around. I wish that the show had more time to explore the complex plots it had coming up, but am grateful they didn't leave us a real cliffhanger.",1066694400,5,410,4.337662337662338
1944023,4,B0000TPA6K,"Season 1 of Roswell is simply one of the best television seasons ever.  The shows combined elements of science fiction, drama, and humor into a suspenseful and tremendously entertaining mix.  Season One contains many, if not most of the best episodes of the show.  Excellent standout episodes include ""Pilot"", ""Leaving Normal"", ""Heat Wave"", ""Balance"", ""The White Room"", and ""Destiny"".  The rest of the episodes are also very, very good.
The DVD release will have many extras including commentary tracks on 7 episodes, deleted scenes with commentary, three featurettes,  actor auditions, a music video, and a gag reel.
And now the bad news and the only reason I'm not giving this release 5 stars.  Because of the extreme costs involving in licensing the music used in the series, some if not all of the music will be changed.  If they had not changed the music, the DVD set would be much more expensive and Fox would probably have to scrap the whole DVD release.  I wish there was some other way, but I don't think there is.  Not enough people would buy the DVD set at two to three times the price.
Bottom line, don't let the music situation stop you from owning one of the best television seasons, complete with a great set of extras.",1066694400,5,1234,4.702325581395349
1944024,5,B0000TPA6K,"All of the hard work of the folks at RosDVD.net paid off! And the extras. How can you not like the thought of all of those extras?! I for one intend to pre-order. I want Fox to know we want more Roswell! Hello DVD, Roswell Feature Film here we come!!",1066608000,3,250,4.02

Liz Parker is one gutsy loving young woman and all the alien story is interesting and suspenseful.  Max is the sweetest example of a young man in love and lust.  Maria is beautiful and talented and Michael is hot and the ultimate bad boy.  I would watch with devotion if brought back or see a movie continuing story.",1474070400,,481,4.523255813953488

1944048,4,B0000TPA6K,"What can I say, I was expecting something along the lines of the X-Files but found an entertaining set of teenage stories in High School soothing the historical alien event. I think this is an intelligent move to introduce the Millennials into the ""all possibilities"" about aliens among us. The show could have had more action episodes with less relationship based dialog and better sets. It appears that the budget was not for a kind of theme the Roswell event signifies to many. In my opinion, its catered to the youth in mind (regardless of terrestrial age) or better to those with an open mind and tired of bloodshed, shooting, cursing, erotic nude scenes as well LGBT agenda to explode all lewd acts of humans nowadays.
It is very difficult to describe in these times how valuable is to find this kind of acting and direction without being a purist. Fact of the matter, it reflects small town USA where still there are hopes to find morality among their inhabitants. I give the 4 stars for acting, roles, etc, and hold one for lack of better production and FX absence. Hey, it is a Sci-fy theme, right?",1470614400,,1107,4.624365482233503

1944056,5,B0000TPA6K,Loved this show when it was on tv and was super excited to find it on Prime. Binged all 3 seasons and am bummed all over again that it was cancelled. At least they gave the show an ending to wrap it up as best they could.,1468540800,,221,3.723404255319149

1944058,5,B0000TPA6K,"I loved this series and was so sad when the end came. I laughed and cried so many times. The show actually gives you a few things to think about regarding the Roswell Crash. Who knows maybe the show has some element of truth or maybe not, who knows? Stranger things have happened!
I really liked that the show was about more than just the aliens and had a really nice mixture of love stories between the characters. I can't remember ever seeing anything about the series in 1999 and was so excited to see a young Katherine Heigl, Colin Hanks (Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson's son), Brendan Fehr, Shiri Appleby, Emilie de Ravin, Adam Rodriguez, Julie Benz and Jason Behr. There was even an episode guest starring Jonathan Frakes as himself and quite a few other actors that were well known long before Roswell.
I am giving it 5 Stars because it held my attention through out all the seasons and I pretty much watched them non stop because I could not wait to see what was going to happen on the next episode.  I only wish it had gone longer. I did find that there is also a movie called Roswell FM that Brenden Fehr stars in. Hopefully the movie will at least be as good as the series.",1466208000,,1179,4.334841628959276

1944069,2,B0000TPA6K,"It has the potential to be a great show but they focus way to much on the relationship between Liz and Max.  The acting is normally ok but when the inevitable lame love scenes come for these 2, the acting goes straight to the worst acting in history, every time.  You would think that they would get comfortable with each other over time, but I swear the level of awkwardness between the 2 grows with every scene they do together.  It's honestly so bad that I think at times the director wanted them to portray feeling awkward with each other, but if that's the case, it just comes off as really bad acting.  It wreaks of something that was made for a teenage girl in love, which you expect to have bad acting, but this just makes you want to fast forward whenever you see those 2 enter a scene together.  If they would have cut 90% of the extremely awkward ""love scenes"" between those 2, I would have given it at least 4 stars as it the plot is actually pretty good IMO.",1465430400,,971,4.255434782608695

Now, for Roswell, the subject matter could very easily lent itself to some pretty outlandish episodes.  But so far, the writers haven't let that happen.  I am a real fan and highly recommend this to anyone, families included.",1461024000,,481,4.734939759036145

1944146,5,B0000TPA6K,"Just happened to try a few episodes to see the lead character Max played by Jason Behr, whom I have had a serious crush on since his debut in the ""Grudge"" and ""Skinwalkers"", he is so very sexy with his boy next door appeal. But I instantly fell in love with all the characters, especially Maria played by Majandra Delfino, who is a young Charlize Theron, with her spunky charm. And of course Michael played by Nicolas Stratton, with that hair..so cute and that James Dean bad boy attitude. I am already in season 2 near the end and can't wait to see season 3.  Extremely good show and now I wish I had watched it when it first aired. I didn't realize what I had been missing.  A fan for life.",1458345600,,692,4.234848484848484

1944156,5,B0000TPA6K,Very suprising that I liked this as much as I did.  Seems like the demographic would be a much younger audience - and probably is.  The first season was compelling - and I enjoyed watching it.  Not sure if the second season will be as much of a draw for me - but don't hesitate keeping Season 1 on your short list.,1458000000,,314,4.032258064516129

1944180,5,B0000TPA6K,"The entire series of 3 seasons is great. Shiri Appleby and Jason Behr as star crossed lovers was a stroke of either lucky or genius casting, and the rest of the cast was great as well. They work together to create a believable group of teenagers dealing with aliens among us while still being behaving as teenagers. Appleby was absolutely adorable. You will probably ether love it or find it boring or possibly not be able to suspend disbelief long enough to wrap the story around you but obviously I'm on the love it side. The music was great and for it's time I think the special effects were as well. It's also refreshing to find something that brings some morals to the table along with the story in a believable manner. I suppose 3 seasons was a good place to end it but a couple more would have been nice. I appreciate that the show didn't take itself too seriously and gave us a little comic relief from time to time. Definitely a worthwhile watch",1455840000,2,954,4.426136363636363

1944188,1,B0000TPA6K,"Very predictable and super hokey, like the super science nerd putting on a leather jacket and acting like the Fonz.  I know this was geared to a younger audience and I am not young, but my teenage daughter couldn't make it through the first episode.  I gave it a shot and watched the second only to confirm my evaluation based on the first.  This series is bad...bad everything...bad idea...bad storylines...bad acting...and bad sets.  Can I get a refund on these two hours of my life frittered away by watching this.  I gave it 1 star and that was generous.  A -1 star would be more appropriate.",1455580800,,596,4.5754716981132075

I remember lying to my boss telling her I had class on Monday nights because that is when this show aired and I didn't want her scheduling me to work that night. I bought this for my now 12 year old daughter to watch because it's a clean entertaining show with handsome boys and cute girls and its just fun. Well she loves it so much. I still don't understand why it was cancelled back then. Anyways watching this reminds me of my youth in the 90's and it's just so much fun to watch again.

1944282,5,B0000TPA6K,"it took a couple of episodes to get into this show but as a lover of science fiction I am more forgiving of the venue. The show had  improved dramatically by the end of Season I.  I think it is the best I've seen since Buffy (of this type, teenagers, etc.).  I'm not saying it is of the quality of Buffy but it has a bit of that feel, a lot of humor, interesting writing, good characters who develop nicely.  Season two really takes off, everyone seems comfortable with their characters and the interaction between them is a lot of fun.  The acting seemed to improve as well in Season two and you probably will find yourself crying along in some of the sadder scenes.  The story line holds together better than most and it actually has an ending at the end of Season three.  Overall I feel 5 stars is warranted.  Especially when I look at some of the stuff that stayed longer with terrible acting and dumb writing.",1448064000,,914,4.3352941176470585

1944337,2,B0000TPA6K,"Perhaps I didn't give Roswell enough of a chance, but after viewing most of the first pilot episode, I was turned off by what seemed like an absurdly improbable teenage love story. Unlike the science fiction that I normally enjoy which always has some scientific basis that supports the realm of possibility (e.g. warp drive), this series resorts to fantasy (e.g. If you like movies like the Twilight series, you'll like Roswell).  Also I need to point out some of the inaccuracies I saw in the first episode. Being a resident of the state of New Mexico and having visited Roswell, other than the occasional NM license tag and driver's license, most of the scenery was clearly  the southern California Mojave desert.  There are no joshua trees in New Mexico (or saguaro cacti for that matter). Even though much of NM is mountainous,  Roswell is pretty flat terrain and there were mountains in the scenery. Knowing that a lot of filming is done in NM, I would have expected a series that claims to be in NM would at least be filmed in NM. Perhaps I did not give the series enough of a chance, but the story seemed more and more like a giddy teenage love story rather than a science fiction. Not for me.",1443225600,,1201,4.546296296296297

I think the concept was a good one but, like the show 'Heroes,' this show suffers from inconsistent writing and poor character development.
Case in point, in season 1, Max takes a sip of alcohol and is instantly drunk due to his inability to process alcohol.  In season 3, he's drinking champagne at a wedding without any effects.
The characters don't seem to progress throughout the seasons.  The basic MO is: Max is selfish and uptight, Michael is inept at relationships and Isabel is socially and emotionally repressed by her brothers, show...after show...after show.
Now take the above and mix in shows that have characters acting COMPLETELY uncharacteristic and you'll begin to lose interest.  I know I did.",1442620800,,816,4.814285714285714

1944437,5,B0000TPA6K,"Recently decided to rewatch this series. As excellent with a few years as it was then. The stories do a good job using the alien metaphor to play with alienation themes, coming of age, and giving space for commenting on American (1st world western) society. Acting while young is great and the less polish for some of the actors helps add to the edge for the teen angst they are suppose to portray. Plenty of goofiness to keep the overall tone very light which is part of why it works. Compared to many of today's coming of age set series this does it much better as the kids exhibit the classic problem of being over mature/hyperaware compared to the adults around them but only a bit. There are only a few instances of dues ex machina and they aren't too blunt a 2x4. Season 3 much a definite degrade but still very watchable.",1440720000,,828,4.4183006535947715

Except there were no curse words peppering the script, I recognized Katherine Heigl from State of Affairs And Nick Wechsler from Revenge.  But the acting was sound and believable and gave the aliens an enhanced humanity and a love of sweet and hot putting Tabasco sauce on most things. The leads kept me interested and Shirk Appleby was charming as a student waitress. This is something most of the family can enjoy. Sorry there are no more seasons to follow. Fr.

Favorite highlights - the shooting scene where Max Saves Liz...The classroom scene where Max points to the sky, When I first saw this show, I fell in love with the series of ""discoveries,"" as well as the romance between Max and Liz. Writing, directing and acting all come together to provide perfect squishy feelings of ""what if"" moments that just keep on coming.

The story kept spiralling, and each episode someone had to ""save the day"", but the dangers kept on growing. I was very happy to see that there was a second season, as I just can't stop watching this series yet.  Maybe it's because I live in New Mexico, and have been to Roswell a few times ( including the Alien Museum ), that I find this whole subject so fascinating. Enjoy !

I liked seeing the young people acting like ""kids - high school teenagers""  Having never been to Roswell, I don't know if the town has such crazy alien restaurants and museums but it seems plausible.  The beginning has a terrific premise so I went with it to the end of the season.  On the downside, and toward the latter part of the season, I thought there was way too much ""kissy face"" going on.  It didn't add to the story, IMO.  In fact by the end of the season, I lost interest.  Still, it was worth a look.",1439596800,,558,4.111111111111111

1944495,4,B0000TPA6K,"It begins with a teen girl saying that ""5 days ago [she] died. Then things got weird."" It was very true. I enjoy the slow burning teen angst that permeates every episode. The characters are likeable though a bit stereotypical. The secrets reveal themselves slowly and help you to understand and empathize with each of the youths as they flee from persistent danger.

The series is set in Roswell, New Mexico so the alien clichs are abundant. It predates cell phones and personal computers so the characters speak face-to-face in English. No Emoticons. No OMGs. No LOLs. It harkens back to my childhood when girls were an alien species that I did not understand but was psychically drawn toward. I can feel the psychic 'magnetism' of the couples as they struggle to fight their natural urges for fear of being weak or vulnerable to the other. Fear of rejection by the group is a unmentioned constant of the characters.

Without divulging spoilers, the plot is always twisting. Victory always just beyond reach. And as with most serials, there are the 'bad guys' that constantly ruin the peaceful tranquility of the sleepy small town. Parents are all oblivious to the peril that is always looming close bye. The government is a danger to those that are struggling to 'save the world'. The kids cannot trust any adults to help them. ""They just won't understand!""

There are 22 episodes in the first season. Unheard of by todays standards. Kudos for that Warner Brothers. I have just begun the second season and only allow myself one taste of this sweet dessert every few days. It must be savored for it is a rare treat.

Enjoy!",1437868800,3,1624,4.74822695035461

1944589,5,B0000TPA6K,"I have enjoyed re-watching one of my guilty pleasures, Roswell, the past few days.  Yes, it is teen fodder and I'm a grandmother, but I'm a sucker for a ""Romeo & Juliet"" story-line. Throw in some scifi and you really have me hooked! Some of the acting scenes can be a bit cheesy, and cliches abound, but I still enjoy it.  And some of the then young stars are still involved in the business. Sheri Appleby is getting great reviews in Lifetime's UnReal; Nick Wechsler starred in ABC's Revenge; Emilie de Ravin starred in Lost and now stars in ABC's Once Upon A Time; Katherine Heigl and Colin Hanks have been in many movies and TV shows; and Jason Behr, Brendan Fehr and Majandra Delfino have remained busy with films, television and music.

The show is about three aliens, supposed from the 1940's Rowsell UFO crash, and their interaction with their human friends.  These aliens had been in a suspended state is some pods out in the New Mexico desert until they ""hatched"" in human form.  They are all teenagers attending high school and trying to figure out their place in the world. The show explores their search and how they become involved with their human friends while trying not be be discovered by the FBI and the local sheriff.

High drama it is not, but it remains one of my favorite shows, and I get a kick out of recognizing the stars as they further their careers.",1434412800,5,1377,4.532258064516129

The basic idea is that aliens crash to Roswell, NM in the 40's and are ""born"" out of their incubation pods 50 years later looking like 6 year olds.  They hide who they are from those around them until their secret starts to get out.  It's a story about them in high-school and their relationships with humans.",1425945600,,472,4.441860465116279

Seemed to me like a show for 15-year-old girls since the story focused on teenagers that were supposedly the offspring from the Roswell crash.  Well.....the crash was in 1947.....so the survivors could not be teenagers, right?  They conveniently 'splain that by saying they were in an incubator ""or something.""  Anyway, I was expecting more of an X-files, something that actually kind of gave me goosebumps or kept me engaged, but sadly it seemed more of like a Teen Wolf-type storyline.  The boy has a secret and the girlfriend has to keep her mouth shut of they will take the boy away.  I watched two episodes and gave up.  By the way, no diss to girls, I am one and I was actually 15 once.  I might have liked it back then.",1424390400,2,802,4.520833333333333

1944995,5,B0000TPA6K,"For how emotional this series gets, it is amazingly unawkward.  I could knit pick here and there at a few things but in its entirety, the series gets progressively more and more interesting, all the way to the end of third season, where it seems (3rd season) budget is cut, but it does not affect the series in a negative way by the end of 3rd season, it is at it's best and you are hoping for more.  That leaves my major complaint about the series, this series could have easily had 4 more seasons, there are so many elements that it could concentrate on.  However sadly no more seasons, if they ever did a revamp, it might be good, but it would not be same without these actors, playing their respective roles.  The actors in this series really seemed to be absorbed in their roles and all positive effects of that can be observed.  Why is it that all good sci fi tv series come to an early end!!??  Dark Angel Roswell.  If someone out there is listening please make another ""superhuman sci fi series with emotional connection with its audience"" like this with at least 8 seasons with 160 episodes.

1945037,4,B0000TPA6K,"I always seemed to find myself shying away from watching Roswell because it was a little to cliche and the previews I had seen led me to think it far to adolescent to be entertaining to an old science fiction hound whose children are almost old enough to be the parents of the stars of the show.  But I finally broke down one day and realized how many adolescent shows I had watched and found them to be more than just a category and maybe, just maybe I should give it a chance.  Half way through the season I hadn't really changed my mind and was about to abandon the rest when the intensity picked up and the storyline deepened.  I'm now glad I finished as this is not a linear growth curve in intensity of plot, it is much more exponential with the last quarter of the season moving faster with twists and turns I truly didn't see coming, and I always see them coming.  It definitely has its share of teenage romance, but it still became entertaining and grew into a show I enjoyed and found hard to stop watching.  The dangers of streaming!  All I can say at the end of season 1 as I ready myself to watch the first episode of season 2 is it is much better than I expected and hope that the intensity of the pace and surprises keep on coming and keeping me saying the same after season 2.  Not going to cause great developments in deep thought, but entertainment is just that.",1419033600,,1380,4.244274809160306

Having not checked the original air date before watching, I pegged it as 90s television within the first 10 minutes (and I wasn't wrong). Not bad, but nothing special here. Roswell is weak on the ""science"" half of ""science fiction"" and heavy on the young adult drama (which isn't surprising, given that it was based on the ""Roswell High"" YA book series). So for teens/ tweens it's more likely to be in the range of 3 to 5 stars, but for me it's about 2.5 (""watchable"" by the thinnest of margins). On the plus side, Julie Benz is in the recurring cast as ""guidance counselor"" Kathleen Topolsky, this being prior to her roles as Darla in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angel/dp/B003YF9Q08/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angel</a>, Rita Bennett in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dexter/dp/B00DXOHR6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dexter</a>, or Amanda Rosewater in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Defiance/dp/B00KO7NUWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Defiance</a>.

Perhaps the young Roswell actors not looking like supermodels was appealing to many viewers... or the Molly Ringwald without red hair played by Majandra Delfino.

I'm going to keep the Pros and Cons list super-short since there are already 638 reviews written for Season 1 on this site alone:

PROs
+ the humor of the show (more situational rather than in the dialogue, such as the irony of an alien working at the UFO conspiracy center) is what makes Roswell tolerable for me

CONs
- the all-consuming puppy love theme of Roswell makes it difficult to watch for any sci-fi fan who isn't under 18 years of age",1416268800,2,2103,6.291666666666667

Don't expect this TV series to provide any solutions for grand interstellar peace; it is about teenagers finding their place in the world, and of course being convinced, as only teenagers can, that the entire world...nay, the entire UNIVERSE...actually does revolve around them.

Still fun to watch, not for anyone under 12 certainly, as some of the ""alien relations"" scenes are a bit more than they really needed to be.",1415923200,,651,4.944954128440367

There are a few episodes that experiment with same actors playing different characters, and many of the other experiments we see with series today.

This was a lot of fun to watch as a 2684 minute marathon form start to stop. After the last episode, that wrapped the story up better than most series, you keep waiting for the movies franchise to take over. Waiting, waiting waiting ...

I am going about this backwards and now plan to read the series.

of Roswell.  Sort of a teen-romance story with the sci-fi element thrown in for
drama.  I liked the lead actress and thought her acting was really quite good.

I would recommend it for the youth audience but I enjoyed it too and will
pop in occasionally to look at another episode..for me it's light and not gory
so far anyway.  It's not a brain killer or a dream smasher..it's good for
what it is..It's like the first alien movies in that the aliens are good guys and
the government will dissect them if they find them kind of thing..Reminds me
of ""The man who fell to earth""  now that's a good movie in this same idea.",1399766400,,541,4.294117647058823

1945251,5,B0000TPA6K,"Roswell is probably my overall favorite show. It is like a high school drama with some sci-fi mixed in. Season 1 was probably my favorite. I love Max and Liz. The actors do a really good job with them too. You can feel the sexual tension and how they are pulled to each other. And their eye contact OMG.
It's funny because in real life Jason Behr (Max) was dating Katherine Heigl, who played his sister Isabel on the show.

This show is so great. The one downside with the digital release of Roswell that is available here on Amazon is that it is the same versions that were released on DVD. And the DVD releases changed lots of great songs to save on copyright costs. A new viewer of the show wouldn't notice the changes. But for old fans like me who saw it on TV and watched their VHS tapes taped off the TV it's can be awkward sometimes hearing a totally different song. I notice the music changes mostly in Season 2, but just a heads up.",1398643200,,941,4.227777777777778

I also thought this show would be some kind of teen angst show similar to Dawson's Creek. I was wrong & although the show does revolve around a cast of teens the show is able to draw the interest of all age groups. There is a lot of Sci-Fi, suspense,mystery & of course romance. The romance element is not corny at all because I found the chemistry between Max & Liz to be very mature in a way relatable to most adults. Also I liked how human Max, Isabel & Michael were portrayed as beings with emotions & feelings as well. It's a great show that should not have ended so abruptly!!",1397347200,,673,4.184615384615385

We enjoyed the acting and the filming of this TV series.  And the plot, although at times farfetched and somewhat ridiculous was highly entertaining and we kept looking forward to more.  Lots of laughs and I really admired the characters of all the kids.  We both hope there will be more forthcoming especially considering the way it ended.  That can't be the END of the Roswell aliens and their adventures and future lives together.  But if this is the real ending of the story, kudos to the writers of this screenplay.

1945321,5,B0000TPA6K,I missed the series when it was on as I worked nights. So when I had the chance to watch it on Prime I grabbed it. I loved it. It was fun because the young actors have all gone on and I recognized them. The scripts were very good and the acting was outstanding. Great special effects!

Any how, I always laugh because the aliens have quite a lot of mood swings. Stinking teen aliens. It's worth watching....some good shows, some funny lines....Roswell Christmas Carol was so funny (season 2)!  There everywhere...not the aliens...the Christmas Nazis.

However, after season 1 (seasons 2 and 3) things became, IMHO, a bit tedious and repetitious.

1945345,3,B0000TPA6K,"Watchable. I tend to watch shows like this because they're not over done or overly serious. The premise os good, but lets face it, it can only go so far. This is a good filler show.... you know, something to watch until the next episode of Falling Skies, or Sons of Anarchy becomes a available.",1383696000,,294,4.363636363636363
1945346,1,B0000TPA6K,"Roswell...I thought to my self ""hey what a great idea! What if it the crash of 1947 turned out to be true, and if so what happened?""
Well it could have been great, and like watching an oncoming train wreck between two trains on the same track it is impossible to turn away even though you want to. I watched every episode, because well that's what rubberneckers do at train wrecks.

Let me save you some time and trouble. Here is the bulk of the dialog you would hear. ""I'm sorry. It's complicated. It will be okay...did I mention ""I'm sorry?"" The repetition of those sentences and phrases will drown out any other dialog and will make the rest seem like time filler. The plot goes like this. Small town alien space man meets small town Earth girl, gets girl, loses girl, gets girl, loses girl, gets girl back, loses girl....

This could have been a great show, but unless your thirteen, don't bother, because you won't appreciate or get it. Of all the scifi I've seen, this is the kiddy-pool squared and grown ups are trespassers. Think of your kids room door, the one that reads ""do not enter"" and heed that warning.",1383350400,2,1118,4.4754901960784315

The episodes reveal more about the events that took place afterwards and captivate your interest in where this is all leading.

1945383,5,B0000TPA6K,"I'm so hooked! Jason Behr, Katherine Heigl, Julie Benz, Nick Weschler (sketch AF, can't believe he plays Jack Porter in Revenge) in one show? OMG! And it's so 90s! Also, it has a lot of social commentary that can be seen as analogous to racism, in-group/out-group bias, marginalisation, concealable stigma, identity issues, psychological distress, neoliberal policies, and governmental disinvestment in social welfare projects to reallocate resource towards something that doesn't really benefit mankind. I heard a slight hint of homophobia and saw some benevolent sexism too. From the evolutionary perspective (ahem, my field of study), I see the Westermarck effect, kin altruism, alloparental care, Cinderella effect, the list goes on and on. This show is just so good! Seeing a show written by writers from the late 90s perspective allows me to delve into the beliefs and values of those writers and compare them to what's current. For one, I'm on episode 7 and I've only seen two people make out, and they were only supporting characters...so unlike today's shows! Such a learning experience for me, which I think is awesome. Maybe I'm looking into it too academically, but try to watch it too! I think it was meant to be that way anyhow.",1373241600,,1242,5.0931372549019605

1945386,5,B0000TPA6K,"We only got 3 seasons of Roswell and it just wasn't enough. The show was based on a bunch of very short young adult paperbacks called Roswell High about a group of kids that were brought to Earth in the Roswell crash in 1947. However, it was only their genetic material that was brought to Earth - they weren't actually born until the 1980's when they broke out of their ""pods"" looking like 7 year old human children. Max, Isabel & Michael know that they aren't like other human children. They have ""powers"" that they've hidden from the humans around them. Powers they've even hidden from their adopted parents, afraid of what might happen to them if people found out what they really were. They are especially afraid of Sheriff Valenti, the sheriff of Roswell.

Everything changes when Liz Parker gets shot in the Crashdown Cafe. Max risks everything to save her, drawing unwanted attention to himself, as well as Isabel and Michael. Not only is Sheriff Valenti suspicious, but he calls the FBI and they begin an investigation as well. With their secret getting out, who can be trusted and who can't? Roswell is way more than a sci-fi show.",1372377600,2,1141,4.676616915422885

Then they switched it from WB to another station that i did not have. I was so dissapointed....because i was only able to see the first season. i was 15 at the time. 13 years later i stumble across the series here on Amazon! I was so excited....but also kind of wondering whether the show was actually as good as i remember...or whether my memories were just the result of the poor judgement of a 15 year old. So i dedicated some time and sat down to watch the first season all over and to finally watch the second and third season. I was so happy to find out that it really was as good as i remembered.

It can get kind of creepy at times, but so far nothing too bad. The only thing missing is the witty dialog that Buffy had, but that just makes it a little more of a drama than Buffy.

I found this show on Amazon Instant Video (prime) and I am so glad I have. This show is a little older, but so far in season 1 it doesn't have the gruesome topics that it seems that all dramas have now. It's a great show that never gets too dark, so far anyway.
It is about aliens and friends (the original main character is not an alien) in an alien-tourist town, but it doesn't really come across as ""alien-y"" to me. I am NOT a fan of aliens (except for the movie), but this show has a certain charm that certainly caught me off guard.

If you decide to give this show a try, I recommend watching at least two episodes before you make up your mind (of any show). The first episode of a series is never the best.",1364515200,,1057,4.101449275362318

These aliens had already studies humans. Human bodies and brains. They'd learned that the human brain is capable of pretty much any mental ability ever theorized - telepathic, telekinetic, self-healing, etc. Humans just don't know how to use those abilities.

They combined DNA from the Royal Four, and four humans, The Royal Four were reborn, as hybrids of human and alien. The hybrids were designed to be more powerful than either species.

The plan was to raise them to be ready to return and reclaim there throwns and planet. The Roswell crash ruined that plan. For decades the Hybrids grew in incubation pods, before emerging.

The characters have fantastic depth and chemistry, and you get to see them from all sides -good, bad, flaws, stregths- making them feel real and bringing authenitic emotion to the show.  Of course, as a drama about alien teens and friends in highschool, there is some over the top angst and some cheesy stereotypes that come into play through the series, but it doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment you can get from the storytelling.  Even though the series was cancelled early, they managed to wrap it up with a satisfying and happy ending -you won't be left hanging even if you might be wishing for more!  One last note: one of my favorite things about this show is the music incorporated into the episodes.  The writers really did an excellent job with choosing beautiful, poingnant songs that add to the mood of the scene and the series as a whole.

1945451,2,B0000TPA6K,"I love sci-fi. When I watched the pilot episode of this show I thought I was going to be hooked (in spite of the fact that the casting was way too old to pass as HS students, and the wardrobe/makeup dept. did nothing to help hide that fact, and there is no soundtrack to help things either) -- there seemed to be good potential here.

Unfortunately, by the end of episode 5 I've had enough.  The writing/acting is very dull, boring and overall somewhat depressing.  There has been little to no suspense, thrill or intrigue since the 2nd episode.  And sure - there could be some in store (after all this show survived for a few seasons), but I have lost interest.

They had an idea here with great potential - and totally blew it. I honestly hope that someone else takes this idea and redoes it, the right way. (""Bad Robot"" productions probably would have made this show thrilling) But so far this show has been about as deadpan and unexciting as it gets.

1945452,5,B0000TPA6K,"This series has to be one of my all time favorites. The writing over all had depth and many times gave you multiple views to the problems the characters faced. The acting was exceptional and really engaged you into the story. Many times you struggle to believe actors could be the characters they are portraying, that is not the case here. This cosmic romeo and juliet type love story has you enthralled from the start. The struggles of these teens to find their identity as alien and as human masks the struggles we all faced in high school ourselves. The ending of this series was rather abrupt because of its premature cancellation. So the ending although acceptable still stings like a good back hand to the face. The books that are written by the same writers from the series are great to accompany the series. The worst part of this release is its not the same as I remember watching as when I was growing up. Unfortunately, the series did not have rights to the amazing up and coming bands of the times songs they used in the series, like Linkin Park for example. So for the dvd release they added new songs, except for the main opening track, with similar feel, but still not the same. If you have never seen the series before it should not affect you at all. With all that said it is still an exceptional series and will have you wanting to rewatch it again and again.",1339372800,5,1377,4.446640316205533

  In roswell new mexico aliens are a big deal. years back it is said that a space ship crashed there and a man died. ever since then the town has been obsessed with aliens, almost to the point of being a tourist attraction. one day at the diner there is a confrontation where one man pulls a gun and a waitress is fatally shot but a boy comes up and then she is fine. she gets up, no harm done. Thats when the show really gets started. who is the boy and what on earh (no pun intended) did he do to her? Anyways, it quickly unravels that during that legendary crash years ago there were 3 pods (4 but they don't know it) which contained small children (alien children) and they were found roaming naked later on and taken in as humans to be raised as such. thats the basic plot of the show. starting with her and slowly growing a small band of people who have to decide to protect their new ""otherworldly"" friends. i especially loved the scene in the pilot where their having the annual crash party and they set off the space crash gag while everyone jumps around cheering and partying in space suits where the 3 ""left behind"" watch the gag obviously taking it in a very different way.
well, from that episode on i was hooked. great tv show and you really cant beat the price. i could watch these over and over again and now im trying to get my mom into it.

My dad had just passed away, and I was extremely depressed for several months. One day I turned on the TV hoping to find a show or movie I could get lost in, when I found Roswell. I fell in love with the show from the get go, mainly because it was the type of show my dad would watch, in fact after telling my brothers and sister about it, they informed me that he had indeed watched it.

I was really expecting a lot more from the writers, actors, etc.  It was as though someone said: Let's get a bunch of pretty people in a drab environment and see if we can make a hit show.  I was really dissappointed with this one and grateful at the same time, 'cause I was on the verge of buying all three seasons at once.  Thank GOD, I said lemme see how season 1 goes and take it from there.  I will give the writers credit in one area, they did not take years to get to the bottom of the sheriff finding out whether those kids were what he thought they were.  This show was just not for me.

Max, Liz, Michael, Maria, Isabel, Sheriff Valenti, Kyle, Tess, Alex. The next season has more.
Every character has an important part. The story is really too long for me to summarize. All i can say is that everything begins when Max heals Liz after she is shot by some men in the restaurant. Max has had a crush on Liz since childhood. Liz refuses to let it go. Max tells her the truth and Liz is now tangled in the life of an alien.",1250899200,,656,4.173228346456693

It does bring an insult to the others on the show. This set is much cheaper and there isn't anything worth-while that would cause you to spend an additional $20 dollars on. (unless you love the design--like they want you too)

Onto the season....

I too wished the orginal music was in Roswell. The new replaced version isn't bad, but just isn't the same. The season went on like a teenage love story. It at times, compeltely mae me loose interest and had to go to the next episode. We had a overally skepitcal sherriff who is content on believing in UFOs and Aliens. We have three main characters ad three supporting roles (3 alien/3 human). They all seem to have a love interest with each other. (one dosn't blossom--well somewhat--until the 2nd season) in the ole-alien/human relations that's been played out to no end. it side-tracks a bit, it gets back on, and sidetracks again.

My children are fans of Smallville and thought this series had a similar feel to it.  This series satisfies my science fiction preferences and also entertains my young teenagers with the relationships of the characters.  This SciFi series is a well written epic of 3 teen aliens trying to find out who/what they really are and what their destiny is.  I recommend this for young teens and older.

This show has the perfect level of sci-fi and teen relationships and difficulties. These teens have the usual problems which everyone can relate to in some way, yet they have to deal with being outsiders - literally. Everyone wants to feel like they are unique and that their lives are interesting, well, for the Roswell group this goes to the extreme. I have no idea why so many people were too idiotic to realize the genius of this show, so unfortunately it ended after a mere 3 seasons. In any case, these three seasons will hold my interest way longer than any other show can.

One Month Later I now have all 3 Season's in my possession and I have watched NOTHING but Roswell since the day the First Season arrived!!
Right from the Pilot I was completely hooked. The characters are fantastic and it's wonderful how they evolve through the 3 Seasons. The relationships between the characters are SO genuine and believable and I was drawn into the emotional turmoil immediately. I know the show is Science Fiction, but its not all consumming doesn't descend into the pit of unintellegible mumbo jumbo or get to lost in it.
I LOVE Max and Liz's intense love for each other. No matter what they do they just can't run away from it. Perfectly matched couple.
Michael and Maria have a totally different relationship, but nontheless intense.
As for Isobel,  I wasn't sure I even liked her at first, but her character really grows on you and you begin to understand why she is as she is.
As for Jim & Kyle Valenti, this in one father and son duo that by the end of the show I was in love with. Excellent characters and I just wanted to hug poor Kyle sometimes.
This series has it all; Drama, Romance, Mystery, Suspense, and a very generous dose of Comedy!

My conclusion? BUY THIS SERIES!! I have started lending it out to all my friends and they have all been just as estatic as me over it. Absolataly worth EVERY penny!",1214956800,,1603,4.408783783783784
1945490,5,B0000TPA6K,"Roswell was so much more than a show on TV. It was a fantasy, an adventure and to some a way of life. Alienism (is that a word?) was a metaphor for all the isolation we all feel. This season was truly a love story and to me it began when Liz and Max looked into each other's eyes at the end of the 'Pilot' I knew this was it. Try and watch any episode in the first season and trust me you will be enamored by the love story of Max and Liz, the lustful rantings of Michael and Maria, and the befuddled affection of Alex and Isabel. From the `Pilot' to `Destiny' you will understand a world that millions fell in love with, a world that seemed more than us and more than Roswell itself; the fantasy, intrigue, and exploration of an otherwise improbable plot that coincide to create the perfect intergalactic romance.",1208822400,,814,4.258064516129032

I then loaned it to my mom and my brother who loved it equally. This show may star teenagers but if you love sci-fi, it doesn't matter. I'm 31 and my mom is 60, we are far from teenagers.

1945497,5,B0000TPA6K,"Wow such an underrated show! I loved watching Roswell as a kid when it first aired on the WB and eventually stopped watching for some reason I can't remember. Years later, I rediscovered this show and instantly fell back in love with all of the characters and was sucked into the storyline once again. The main premise basically follows two high school kids from the small town of Roswell, New Mexico who fall in love - and of course, one of them just so happens to be an alien w/ supernatural powers. Throughout the series we see their relationship with each other, their friends, and family all grow and evolve while constantly trying to keep these aliens safe from harm. Season 1 focuses more on the relationship between the main characters, dealing with issues surrounding feeling like an outsider, experiencing first love, and discovering the supernatural abilities of the aliens. Seasons 2 and 3 we see the show make a shift towards focusing mainly on the supernatural aspect of the show. All in all, while the writing is not always as great as I'd like, I really do love watching Roswell even after all these years. It's seriously one of the sweetest stories I've ever seen and will forever be a favorite of mine. I'd recommend watching the Pilot episode to see for yourself (It has many of the same themes as the Twilight book series, but it won't make you nearly as angry I promise) Definitely recommend this one - 5 stars!",1196380800,,1432,4.664031620553359

They also cut out scenes and offered very little in ways of extras. I was disapointed.

I still watch it on the Sci-Fi channel for the original music. For many fans who watched Roswell beginning in 1999, the music replacements on the DVDs are mostly disappointing. A few scenes that stand out for me are the beginning of Heat Wave (Santana/Everlast--Put Your Lights On), Alex's strip tease in Surprise (Quad City DJs) and any scene with Sarah McLachlan and Counting Crows songs. There are many more, of course, but those are a few which most lost the feeling and mood of the original episode. On their own, I think a lot of the replacement songs are great but in the context of Roswell, many of them just don't hold up to the original.

It is for this reason that I have started a petition to get Roswell re-released in high definition with ALL of the original music--Roswell on Blu-ray disc, DVD or HD DVD with the original music and more extras. Keywords: Roswell on DVD the Right Way.

Please note: I don't make any money from this and will be paying for such a re-release just like the rest of you. Buy the DVDs here (I did) and watch the original episodes on the Sci-Fi channel for comparison--the music matters.",1174608000,8,1293,4.521367521367521

1945511,5,B0000TPA6K,"First of all - the first ten of minutes of the pilot episode are about the best ten minutes of any pilot I have ever seen.  The story gets off to a really exciting and complex start right away.  There is immediate chemistry between Max Evans and Liz Parker along with the mystery of Max Evans and what he and his friends can do as well as a feeling of the danger they are in.  I was hooked right away.....

If you are a fan of Buffy The Vampire Slayer then I would recommend this show.  I never watched Roswell when it was on TV but discovered it on DVD.  This show is a great mix of teenage romance, science fiction and action with a good dose of humor in the mix.  The Max / Liz drama is one of the most compelling television romance stories I can remember.  Jason Behr (Max) is really sexy.  Overall a very entertaining show.",1174435200,2,828,4.125

1945516,5,B0000TPA6K,"Roswell is an excellent series. It is obviously a teen series, but adults can watch this one too, as the story is very intriguing. And some of the young actors are excellent, I particularly like Majandra Delfino, the actress that plays Maria...She is excellent and very funny. The series would slip into corniness without her.

The plot in the first season is very good. Liz is injured at work by a shooter and Max heals her, hence revealing that he is an alien. It turns out that he, his friend and his sister Isabel are all three aliens, human alien genetically engeneered hybrids to be specific, which were born out of a pod dropped on Earth during the Roswell crash. The three are just as clueless as to why thay are on Earth and of who they are as the rest of us. So the story is an interesting twist on the coming of age, finding one's self adolescent theme that is typical of teen dramas. I have described this as the X-files meets the Hardy Boys meets Melrose place, as the story is chock with conspiracy theories, mysteries but also romance. Very fun stuff.

1945526,4,B0000TPA6K,"I loved this show and this season was the best from the begining to end!  Had just the right mix of soap opera style emotions set in high school going around mixed with science fiction.  The next 2 seasons where not as good as this season.  I think mainly due to the chemistry builds up in this season between Max and Liz then is really held back in season 2.  Plus at this point we know more about the alien aspect which would lead to that but it actually started focusing more on that then the human aspect which I feel made the first season great. I really enjoyed the scenery in this series appeared different especially the crashdown cafe with the 2 main characters working there and constantly meeting there plus Liz living above it going on the roof to think things over and Max sometimes meeting her there.  I mostly enjoyed it as a hang out spot for the show.  In the 2nd season Liz does not work there and I feel you loose the closeness between the characters or moreso Maria her best friend since they are not working and talking side by side at work.  I think that worked extremely well in the first season.  However the characters do appear more grown up in the next seasons so maybe that was the effect intended.

I'm only giving it 4 stars due to the music aspect.  The original background music not the score but singer music is different I hear to save money.  While I should just be ecstatic this show is on DVD it was VERY noticible the music was different.  The Fear song by S. Mclaughlin (sp?), and the main Dido song in begining credits are still there and I believe a counting crow and dave mathew song are there but a lot of the other music was changed.  The original music team to select the first music was chosen again to find new and upcomming artist.  There's an explanation I believe it was from producer Katims who said they had to do it this way to get the dvd out and tried to keep the most needed music in. This is true but the original music just worked just right for it and it's not there. In fact some don't fit.  Like a couple of dances when Liz met Max at some party Liz is danicing a little to the beat and just doesn't look right.  Maybe I'm wrong and just focusing on the fact knowing music was changed.  But the white room episode with Max getting shock the music seemed different and to me just did not fit.  I thought it was a more heavy metal sounding loud electronc sound and just heard some loud music with heavy guitar and some drums which didn't add the original impact as the orignal song did.  For me anyway.  I have not watched the show in over a year so I don't even really remember the music that well originally but enough that something is missing from when I originally watched it.  The sound quality is not that great and seems more so when new music had been added.  Katims also further says many of the new music picked out is new and fresh and works just as good or better than the original music and hopefuly gets the word out on these artists.  I totally disagree.  Many of the new music sounds as if some new band at a bar performing.  The production as in the dido song are not there it's mostly almost like an acoustic guitar and minimal produced music.  I mean it sci fi too so I like the synthetic beats added.

Now the DVD is still AWESOME!  And I would not suggest not watching it soley for the music.  The main themes are there.  It would have been overkill if the Dido song and fear song were removed so that's great.  And original score is there which was great.  I'm really into soundtracks so maybe I'm biased with this issue.  The dvd is great. It's the best season of the show.  However, if they added the orignal music I'd sell my current copy and get that one!",1157587200,,3741,4.252124645892351

1945530,1,B0000TPA6K,"Because of the stellar reviews here, I rented the first two discs. Man, this show sucks. I'm floored by how bad the writing is. From the reviews I was expecting ""My So Called Life"" meets the ""X-files"". Instead I got Felicity (or any other teen drama) with three really mundane orphan aliens.

The premise of the show is terribly contrived:

Cute teenage girl has her life saved by a boy that she has a crush on. It so happens the boy is an alien. Okay, fine. The show has to start somewhere. The boy has an alien sister and an alien best friend. The ex-boyfriend of cute teenage girl is the sheriff's son. The sheriff happens to be the son of a known UFO crack-pot/expert and the sheriff is angst ridden about what happened to his father. Father and jilted son are always suspicious of the three aliens and their friends. Cute teenage girl has a best friend who's also cute. Hey, what do you know, the alien's best alien friend is kinda cute too. Instant chemistry. Oh yeah, the alien works in a UFO museum after school so he can do research about his origins. They all go to high school and have teenage pressures and problems. But on top of that, they're aliens! But they're quirky aliens because they put Tobasco sauce on everything they eat. Yeah, that's about how exciting this show is. Alf had more personality and bigger problems. Pssst, the guidance counselor really works for the FBI. Crazy plot twist, no?

That's as far as I got. Maybe I should have given it more time. But I just couldn't force myself. Unless Season 1 ends with a cameo by David Duchovny mercifully putting bullets in the three aliens heads I would just be disappointed.",1149033600,11,1649,4.508361204013378
1945531,5,B0000TPA6K,"It's not often that I stumble upon a television show that I've literally heard nothing about, but Roswell was just such a tv show that later became a mini-obsession.  Season One is definitely the best the series has to offer, although Season Two is worth checking out, if for no other reason to see the heartbreaking episode, THE END OF THE WORLD.

In Season One I challenge anyone to find a pilot with a more gripping, emotional first ten minutes than those of this series.  It grabs you by the throat as Liz Parker is shot and dying in the diner her family owns, and dosen't let go when Max Evans makes the ultimate sacrifice--he risks revealing his alien nature in order to heal the girl he's loved for most of his life.  Of course we don't find out how this scene's pieces fit together, not entirely, until the pilot begins to unfold.  From a glowing silver handprint (which later became an emblem for the series and its fans, right up there with the Tobasco bottles!) to the Crash festival at the end, the series begins as it continues to be for all three seasons: Fun, romantic, very emotionally satisfying...and full of great sci-fi suspense/mystery.

My only complaint about the DVD is that many of the original songs from the series have been changed out for inferior choices.  Still, if you've never seen the show before, it's worth the money to check out these DVDs.

I'll always be a fan.  :)",1148947200,6,1404,4.561752988047809

1945533,5,B0000TPA6K,"I did not watch this series at all when it was first broadcasting and until recently had no intention to watch it.  Although it is obviously getting some good reviews here, it is not a television series that enjoys a good reputation.  I suspect the poor reputation has been generated primarily by people who haven't seen it.  The dislike of many of those who haven't seen it is based entirely on the premise:  high school kids who are also aliens.  I will grant that that is not necessarily a good premise, but it is more what someone does with a premise than anything.  BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER is an equally unpromising premise, but if there has ever been a better show than BUFFY I'd like to see it.  LOST, on the other hand, has a great premise and is doing a superb job of spinning out that premise.  ROSWELL, I would suggest, especially in its first season, is another show that has done a great job with a not-necessarily-all-that-great premise.

The success of THE X-FILES and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER created a demand for more shows along the same lines in the late 1990s.  Just as FOX responded to BUFFY by developing DARK ANGEL, so the WB's immediate response to their own BUFFY was to develop two additional shows along the same line:  CHARMED and ROSWELL.  They even tried to tap into the BUFFY crowd by making the lead of ROSWELL Jason Behr, who had guest starred in an especially memorable Season Two episode of BUFFY, the super ""Lie to Me,"" where he played a former boyfriend of Buffy who was dying from an incurable disease and hoped to become a vampire by betraying the Slayer.  It could have been a silly episode, but it ended up a wonderful meditation on life, death, betrayal, and human nature.  Behr was perfect for the role of Max (a role that Heath Ledger auditioned for).  Although BUFFY created the demand for ROSWELL and shaped the form it would take on TV, the concept itself came from a series of novels directed at pre-teen girls.  The novels clearly exploited the imaginative universe generated by THE X-FILES.  If one tried to say what ROSWELL was like, one would not be wrong in saying it was part BUFFY, part THE X-FILES, and part ROMEO AND JULIET.  The latter comes out in the seemingly impossible love between Max and Liz Parker.  If the Capulets and Montagues created problems for Romeo and Juliet, that was nothing compared to Max's alien relations and Liz's human status.

One thing I love about the show is its approach to narrative.  The 1980s saw the birth and development of the multi-thread television show, beginning with the groundbreaking HILL STREET BLUES.  But what is rarely noted is the way the 1990s gave birth to a new form of series where there was not only multiple story arcs, but a master narrative that extended beyond the individual smaller arcs and gave them their context.  The pioneering show for this genre was TWIN PEAKS and was extended by THE X-FILES and perfected by BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  ROSWELL is wonderful for having virtually no stand alone episodes.  Each episode is intelligible only in the context of the narrative as a whole.  Networks are leery of such formats.  They are great at creating a passionate fan base, but the ongoing narratives makes it difficult for newcomers to catch up on what is happening.  ROSWELL appeared immediately before the now standard practice of bringing out on DVD the previous season near the beginning of the new year, making it far easier for new fans to catch up.  ROSWELL both benefited and was hurt by this format.  It benefited in that the first season was superb narrative television as we got to know the characters, witness the interplay between them, get involved in a number of mysteries, and just speculate in general on what was going to happen.  It was hurt as in subsequent seasons the narrative often became more than a tad silly.  But regardless of what happened in Seasons 2 and 3, Season 1 is a very good season.

The narrative is driven by events that occurred one day in the Crashdown Caf.  Liz Parker, a waitress in the caf her parents own, is shot in the stomach by a stray bullet from the gun of two customers who get in a fight.  Her wound appears to be fatal until Max, a mysterious classmate of Liz's and someone who has nursed a crush on her for years, rushes up to her, places his hand over her stomach, and magically removes the bullet and heals the wound.  Although she and Max try to make it seem that she hadn't really been shot, but that the bullet had broken a ketchup bottle that doused her, the event awakens the interest of a number of people, including the alien hunter section of the FBI as well as the local sheriff.  From this event all the events of the next three years spins.

The show is graced by an excellent cast.  Shiri Apppleby is adorable as Liz and Jason Behr is great as Max (as well as serving as a heartthrob for a host of adolescent girls during the show's run, despite his Clark Gable-like ears).  The beautiful Katherine Heigl, well before her resurfacing on GREY'S ANATOMY, plays Max's sister Isabel.  The third main alien Michael is played by Brendan Fehr.  These three are later joined by a fourth alien played by the remarkably beautiful Australian actress Emilie de Ravin, who was barely able to disguise her accent.  Like Heigl, she has gone on to fame on a highly successful TV show, playing Claire on LOST (and a much more likable character to boot).  The main humans are rounded out by Majandra Delfino as Liz's best friend Maria and Colin Hanks as Alex.  Ironically Liz's pretty vanilla dad is played by the great rocker John Doe, the front man for the important LA punk band X.  For my money, the best performer on the show is William Sadler as Sheriff Valenti.  Sadler, who has more recently been memorable as the less-than-ten-seconds virtuoso in KINSEY and as Jaye's dad in WONDERFALLS, is great as someone who is initially Max's enemy but eventually his friend and protector.  As is typical of modern TV shows, virtually all of the high school students are portrayed by performers in their mid to late twenties.

This is not a perfect show.  Near the end of the season it begins lapsing into slightly silly plotlines and at times it descends a bit too far into high school soap opera mode, but for the most part it manages to be a very well written and immersive extended narrative.  Unless one is irremediably opposed to shows set in high school or shows dealing with Sci-fi or the supernatural, I can't imagine many TV fans being disappointed by this show.  I certainly was not.  I have also enjoyed the following two seasons, though I think neither as good as season one.  I just found the interplanetary plot lines just a bit hard to swallow.  The show remained worth watching to the end, but I regret that it didn't maintain the tone of Season One.  Still, watch it.",1142380800,,6856,4.588331963845522

1945536,5,B0000TPA6K,"Like many shows, I always end up hitting what I call the ""ass end"", meaning I don't get into the shows until long after they've premiered. CSI, Smallville, Lost; the shows were well into their second season before I even paid attention. With Roswell, the show was already over before I actually noticed. It was purely a blind buy: never saw a single episode and it was quite a successful blind buy.

Liz Parker(Shiri Appleby, one of the cutest things that was on primetime) works at the Crashdown Cafe in Roswell, New Mexico so naturally the cafe has an alien theme. 2 men get in a skirmish one day and a gun goes off, nailing Liz in the stomach. An odd buy named Max(Jason Behr) goes up to her and miraculously heals her. So what is he? Well along with his sister Isabel(Katherine Heigl) and Michael(Brendan Fehr), they're aliens with gifts.

Along with Liz's quirky friend Maria(Majandra Delfino) and Alex(Colin Hanks, yes the son of THAT Hanks), they deal with not only questions of where they're from or what they're capable of but also the people who are after them, namely the FBI, or as they were known in the 50's, the G-Men or Men in Black. By the way, they're so obvious FBI agents when you see them. So much for trying to remain inconspicous.

Unlike shows like Smallville or Lost which focused on the story/mystery, Roswell was more like a teenage drama with supernatural elements. The love story of the characters often took a backseat to the story concerning the unearthly teens. At times though you might find it quite thick as characters might do things that just seem so obviously bad such as confessing their love than all of a sudden: ""we can't be together"". It's as if the writers just changed the character situations suddenly to fit the story.

Speaking of which, in the beginning the powers weren't very defined. At least with Smallvile, we know Clark's powers and their limitations so the writers wrote their episodes with them. Here it's like ""crap, I can't get in this door? I know, I'll use my magical lock opening ability. Hm, my pencil's unsharpened. Ooh I'll use my hand to sharpen it."" Later on in the season, the characters pretty much had a main power so they got better.

Since it's the WB you can expect an attractive cast and for the women, boy do we ever. Aside from the aforementioned Appleby, both Delfino and Heigl are quite a sight and the men are good too if you're into men. As for acting, they do their respective stuff well. Not enough to make them incredibly complex but giving enough so they're not one note.

Most likely marketing and advertising but Roswell was cancelled after 3 seasons(the last only had 18 episodes when seasons are an average 22) but in a way it helps since shows can sometimes go on for too long and just repeat episodes(Law and Order or Friends anyone?). I watched the entire first season in one day and it was quite good, only the excessive making out bothered me(it was still hot though).",1133049600,,2961,4.598484848484849

The cost of creating the new music and remastering the sound for all 22 episodes must have been high, and unfortunately it absolutely trashes the show. If you were a fan of the show you will find it incredibly distracting. The new music at the beginning of ""Heat Wave"" sucks! Right now (7/05) Roswell is being shown on the Sci Fi channel with the original music. I suggest that you save your money and watch it there instead.

1945545,5,B0000TPA6K,"I am definitely not into teenage angst and rarely watch any show with the young squirts as central figures.

But there is something so enticing about the Roswell series that grabs your interest and sustains it with the characters of Max, Michael and Isabel looking for someplace called home.

And then Liz & Maria, both working at the Crashdown Cafe along with their teenage buddy [he wants to be, anyway] Alex [Colin Hanks] slowly get involved with Max's secret.

What was a bit funny [as per interview on disc 4] the parents are kept in the dark about the comings and goinngs of their teenagers and then brought into the action when emotions intensify between Max and Liz.  Suddenly there seems to be concerns about the kids actions.  [I do love how they are always broken at a most intense scene]

Maria is such a flake ball and yet she adds a bit of comic relief to the seriousness of Michael's drive to find his non-human parents.  Whoa! what an explaination is in store for them.

Now Nasedo starts showing up and leaving a trail of bodies behind - What is his role in relation to Max, Isabel and Michael?  He is a creepy character.

Ah, Sheriff Valenti [William Sadler] he is quite a disbelieving character and a lot has to do with his broken father.  Kyle has a lot to do with him seeing the mistakes he is making.

He is slowly coming to realize what Max is up against and ends up needing Max to save Kyle.  A very good turn-about.

The characters are woven into a believable community with problems needing to be solved with the teenagers and adults working together.  [well at least some of them].

Flake balls and villians - teenage emotions and danger - well paced and excellent acting - all make up for a great series.

I would rate it along with many of the classics that are out and continually enjoyed by most viewers.

2) If you like Smallville you'll probably like this show

3) Some great dialoge and writing, especially the comic relief we have in the characters of Maria and Kyle

4) You care about each character and each is interesting in their own way

5) This is a sci-fi TV show...so you must suspend belief at times, which we are able to forgive because the soap opera of the characters lives is actually engaging

6) Special effects are ok, not superb but adequate

Overall, we really like this show and as we are currently mid-way through watching the 2nd season it has only gotten better. I hear  the third and final season gets really crazy but I'll have to see for myself when it is released on DVD in October.",1110326400,6,775,4.3776223776223775

Max: "" No.... my life just begun""

ROSWELL: I have to admit that it has taken me sometime too visit this series as i completely missed it when orginally shown on tv show time back. Unfortunely for me, at the time, i was into X-files (though my interest in that show was slowly slipping) and the teen-supernatural monster hit that was Buffy.

A show about aliens that look like teens didn't interest me and i really thought the show would be a mix between X-files and 90210. I remember watching about 5 min of one epsiode of Roswell while it was on tv and switched over pretty quickly as i jsut didn't get it nor allowed myself too.

Cut to 2005 and me bored senseless, flipping the cable networks and coming across the pilot episode for Roswell. I was on the computer chatting to friends and just put it on for back ground.

I'm a hardcore Buffy fan and really didn't think anything could compete with this obsession.

Anyho, i missed the first 5 min of the pilot and came into it just as Max and Co were getting ready to leave Roswell as they had been exposed somehow ( i didn't know why at the time).

I was glued!!!!!! I mean glueddddddddddddddd to the show. All else around me faded and i became, in no less than 30 min, a Roswell fan. The show was not 90210 or the X-files. My god, it had drama, intrigue and characters that i immedtially attached too (primarily Max and Liz).

So, the pilot show ended and so did my net chatting for the day as i got in my car and rented the entire Season One and returned home. I watched the pilot again, this time seeing the shooting that begins this whole drama and the envolvement of the characters.

Then over the course of a week I proceeded to watch the whole season ( i would have easily watched the whole lot in one sitting but unfortunely having to live my real life interferred).

As i watched - what started as a keen interest became a obsession and now i just can't stop thinking about Roswell. After each absorbing episode i thought to myself ....why, WHY didn't i give this a go when it was on televison and could actually have added to the ratings with the slight hope that my 00000000000.00000.1 percent rating would keep the show alive, (well one can hope).

Thankgod now days for DVD releases that allow one to watch these sort of series at yah own pace.

So, what makes this show stand out to me !!!!

First of the show is not just for teens but for many age groups that have or are waiting to experience their first love. Furthermore, the show is dramatic with an excellent sci-fi flair/story. Sure the kids are aliens and sure they are teenagers but this is just represention of the emotions and identity confusion that occurs for all of us at this stage of life and for some way into adulthood.

Yes they are aliens but the thing is they are also half human and it is these emotions that the first half of season one explores with great script writing and character development.

However, it does have a sci-fi element to it (of course) and this really kicks in about half way through season one with a greater emphasis on the alien mystery element of the series.

Thus, because the series has invested alot of time in character development and serious emotional drama the sci-fi is complimented in a way that makes you sit clued to every episode regardless of whehter sci-fi interest you or not. Meaning you are not only attached to the character but also the envolving mystery and story.

ANDDDDDDDDD... the mystery actually MEANS something to the viewer because of the way all the characters interact. A good example of this is the Sheriff characters (who aint a teen) who goes through a transformation during the series. Never was i as emotional as i was when he declared to Max that he would do anything for him and this only occurred due to what preceeded it.

Furthermore, the series has an on-going story arc that you want with series televison. Infact two. A love story (and not a sappy one that doesn't work but one that really hits the notes) and the discovery of where, who and why there are 3 aliens living in Roswell (actully make that 4 but i won't spoil anything).

Both story arc's compliment each other and make the series both compelling and completely addictive.

I'm not gunna do a huge comprasion to this show with Buffy but will say that Roswell is FAR more dramatic than Buffy which tended to have lighter episodes with drama than just drama , drama and drama (though BUFFY ROCKS). And i won't even compare Roswell to Smallville (which is childish, monster of the week type fair with none of the emotional reasonce that Roswell has).

Honestly, i cried, yelled, covered my eyes and shook my hands at the screen while watching this series. I was just that much emotionally connected with the series.

In regards to the casting of the show......brillant (yeah Tess can be a bit meh but so far i like her). By far for me the stand out was Jason Behr as Max.

So , here i am eating some humble pie. The show that i though would be eck is actually great and i should have given this a better chance when it first aired commerically.

Roswell is perfect viewing and will hit (if not already) cult status. I highly recommended this series to anyone and promise it is not 90210 mixed with X-files. It a compelling drama with characters you will like and a story arc that will keep you interested. Furthermore, you might find you reality becoming more and more faded as you continue to excape into the world of Roswell.

Simply Brillant - BUY IT NOW !!!!!",1107129600,6,5627,4.434529582929195

1945555,3,B0000TPA6K,"Since most people looking at this either are already aware of the plot, or will be after having read this page, I'll just comment on the characters and delivery.

I have several issues with Roswell season 1.  While the overall theme and supporting cast make this a good series to watch, the supporting theme and (most of the) primary cast is weak.

The first thing I notice is the generally annoying character of Max. This character is very hypocritical, highly selfish and he actor displays the range of emotion similar to that of Chuck Norris.

Michael, the erratic ""stone cold"" punk kid of the alien trio, is nothing more than some self-centered, ""nothing is my fault"", brat.  It's hard to feel sorry for him in any situation.

Isabel, the sister alien, is generally the better acted and more believable character.  Isabel has emotions and the concept of logical thought.

Of these three, the character of Isabel simply is more realistic.  Max makes numerous demands of what the others should NOT do, then goes ahead and does those things himself.  Big issues include visiting River Dog, telling Liz the truth, and talking/listening to Valenti near the end of the season.  Michael's character doesn't flip-flop much.  He and his punk kid attitude stay consistent throughout the first season.

Liz and Maria (as well as Max and Michael) are nothing more than hormonally driven teens with little to no apparent concept of ethics or restraint.  Sure, I'm working - but come in to where I work... don't say hi, let's just make out.  Yeah, that's the way to carry a strong story right there...

On the human side, Alex is the most endearing of the front three as he struggles with being kept in the dark.

Characters that are not so involved, but are still in many episodes typically are much better written and acted.  Sheriff Valenti, Guidance Counselor Tapolski, and others are where this story really shines.

I find it disgusting that 90% of the ""romantic relationships"" in this series are portrayed as requiring physical intimacy to be the major factor in its development.  Maria's character tries to act like it should be more, but fails miserably at being believable.

The bad set aside, the script that actually has something to do with furthering the story is often done well. I found that, while the above leaves a bad taste in my mouth, the overall story and the real pieces to that puzzle far outweigh the bad.  Thankfully, the real pieces come aplenty.

If you can deal with raging hormones as the supporting theme here, then you will love this series.",1104969600,3,2564,4.790432801822323

The only thing that upsets me more than anything is that this was a show filmed and funded in the United States, but the United Kingdom gets a box set of all three seasons while we're still waiting for season three. That's my only grumble.

I was suprsied to get it because I really didn't push very hard to get it and honestly I had never even watched the show I just thought that there was a slim chance that I might like it.  Boy was I WRONG! I LOVE THE SHOW! From the moment that Liz Parker was shot and then healed by Max Evans I found myself not having the willpower to turn the DVD player off.  The chemistry that Jason Behr(Max) and Sherri Appleby(Liz) have could set a telivision on fire.

The Premis of the show is that three teenagers are not normal teeangers at all but in fact aliens from another planet.  I know it sounds rediculous but it plays out much different on screen.  The three aliens reveal their secret to three normal teens who try to assist them from being caught by the FBI or someone worse. In the meantime a obsessed sheriff comes closer to discovering their secret.  In the midst of all of this, the aliens begin to form romantic feelings from some of the humans, something that they swore they would never do.

The episodes are extremely intense and will definatly have you on the edge of your seat to say the very least.  I can not speak on the quality of season 2, but it is safe to say that this show was canceled WAY before its time.  I would definatly reccomend this for any fan of the TV shows Dawson's Creek, X-Files, or the closest show that I have found to Roswell, Smallville.

1945558,5,B0000TPA6K,"Roswell was one of those special shows that came along so unexpectedly for many people. I'll be the first to admit that I'm not much of a Sci-Fi buff, and a show themed about Aliens and Roswell would most likely not be the first to catch my attention. But back in 2000 when I first discovered Roswell, my entire outlook changed. The show was so deep and refreshing, and really different from the same old shows that were all over the WB and Fox at the time, and really captivated an audience. It wasn't just a teen drama, or some sci-fi blast-em-up, it was a very thoughtful and touching story about a group of friends with a huge secret that no one can find out about, and their many challenges in protecting themselves.

Ok so your first question is probably ""You didn't give a good enough description, what's the show about?"" Roswell is about a group of six friends, three who are aliens, Max, Micheal and Isabel, and three who are human Liz, Maria and Alex. Max, Micheal and Isabel are from another planet, but do not know where. They crashed on earth in 1948 (the famous rosewell alien crash) and just came out of their ship about 16 years ago. When they emerged from their holding pods, their shipped had been destroyed, and they looked like humans. Their entire life they grow up trying to keep their secret hid. That is until one day when Liz is working in her father's restaraunt, the Crashdown, there is an altercation between two people and a gunshot is fired. Liz is hit by the bullet. Max and Micheal were in the crashdown, and Max uses his powers to save Liz. Max then has to reveal to Liz that he is an alien, and he doesn't know where he is from. The secret soon expands to include Liz's friends Maria and Alex. Season One is perhaps the best season of the show. There are so many memorable moments like when Max is captured by Pierce, Max and the others trying to elude Sheriff Velenti (who eventually becomes a good friend) and The discovery of Tess and Nasato. half-way through the season you'll find out that not everyone else in the ship that Max and the others were in died in the crash, and there is also more aliens on earth, one being Tess, Max's wife from their home planet, although they don't remember eachother. The episodes will quickly grow on you, and whether you watched Roswell back in the day, or just got into to it, you'll fall in love with the episodes all over again. At the end of Season one, there are many questions left unaswered, and we have to wait till season two to get the answers.

Unfortunately after three seasons on the air Roswell was cancelled. While I was not at all happy it was ended, I was glad that there was at least a last episode that felt like a last episode. A lot of people say that it didn't get the proper ending and that so many questions were left unanswered, and I agree with that, but at least we didn't get some cliff-hanger that end up just being the last episode and we never found out what happened. I'm still hoping for a Roswell movie like a lot of other people, but they better bring back the original cast. If your a fan of Sci-fi or any kind of teen drama, you're probably going to love Roswell.

1945562,5,B0000TPA6K,"Roswell's first season was extraordinary. The story of 3 alien teenagers living in the small New Mexican town of Roswell. They landed here on July 4, 1947. Not until 40 years later did they emerge from pods as 6 year olds. They were found by two caring people and adopted into a loving family.

 Now as 16 year olds Max and Isabel Evans and there friend Michael Guerin are constantly hiding who they are. They are afraid to be discovered. The plan to stay out of sight was working, until one horrible day Max heals the gun shot wound of a waitress at the local cafe. During a armed robbery she was shot and would have died if he didn't save her life. The girls name was Liz Parker and Max had been in love with her his whole life. After that life could never be the same.

 Max and Liz had seen into each others souls and Liz saw the truth about Max's feelings. From there they lied to the local sheriff Jim Valenti who is suspious of Liz's amazing recovery. And it doesn't help that Kyle, Liz's boyfriend, is his son. And now that Liz is spending a lot of time with Max he is jealous. Besides Valenti the FBI is investigating what happened at The Crashdown Cafe.

As the season nears it's end The 3 aliens find out more and more about who they are and where they came from. But not only are they constantly on the run from the special unit, but another race of Aliens from there home planet. The trios protector shows up to keep them safe and he brings a girl named Tess. Max finds out he was the King of a planet named Antar in a past life and that Tess was his queen in that world. So in the final minutes of the last episode they are again confused about who they are and what they will become.

This all might sound a little too far fetched, but stay with me. I don't like science fiction and will probably never again. Roswell had a special quality about it. The story was a metaphor for not liking who you are and there is nothing you can do about it. That is something all young people go through. Trying to discover yourself and finding out who they want to be. Although sometimes that is different from who you are destined to be.

Asides from that is was a story of true love and that fate brings people together. And if you are meant to be you will find your way to each other. A Romeo and Juliet tale with a alien twist, Max and Liz are the ultimate star-crossed lovers. And the things they do to be together shows the strength of their connection. I can only hope to have half the love and passion in my life time.

This DVD set is great. It comes with many behind the scenes features and interviews/commentaries with the cast and crew. I can't wait till the second season comes out in October. Roswell ran for 3 seasons and was taken away from all of us far too soon. There will never be another show as special and can't be replaced by anything. The show was written and created by Jason Katims who is the genious behind another heart-felt drama gone too soon, My So Called Life. Many first season episodes including the life changing Pilot were directed by veteran tv director David Nutter. And if that wasn't enough it is produced by Star Trek star Johnathan Franks.

 This show was the little engine that could and I wish it never ran out of gas. The show had the perfect mix of adventure and relationships. It showcased amazing friendships that could get throw anything. Still not convinced? I bought this even though I have every episode on tape already. It was worth the $50 to have this precious show preserved for future generations to enjoy as much as I did.",1095811200,14,3583,4.294814814814814

The special feaures were great and the documentary of how the show started was very insightful. I liked seeing the film clip from Sensefield as well as the audition tapes.

1945565,4,B0000TPA6K,"At some point, every teenager feels like an outsider - an 'alien'. This show takes that common teenage angst literally, focusing on the lives of 3 teenage extraterrestrials in high school in Roswell, New Mexico.

This season revolves around a core of 6 characters: the aliens - Max Evans, Isabel Evans, Michael Guerin - and the humans - Liz Parker, Maria DeLuca, Alex Whitman. The 3 alien children were found wandering in the desert, Max and Isabel by their adoptive parents, Diane and Phillip Evans, while Michael was found later and has been in and out of trouble and the foster care system ever since. Max is introspective, thoughtful and responsible; Isabel is beautiful and popular and uses her social position to mask her insecurities and fears; Michael has suffered a difficult childhood and focuses only on finding a way 'home', sure in his conviction that it has to be better than where he is and even more confident that no outsider can be trusted with their secret. Among the humans, Liz Parker is most like Max, responsible and intelligent, with typical teen anxiety about her identity and future. Maria DeLuca is Liz's best friend and near polar opposite; being raised by her mother after her father left them, Maria tries to be as independent as possible and has an affinity for odd herbal remedies. The third member of their group is Alex Whitman, a fairly typical guy who likes computers, plays guitar in his band and is willing to go as far as he needs to for his friends.

The series begins in the touristy, alien-themed Crashdown Cafe where Max and Michael are hanging out; Liz, Max's longtime crush, is a waitress there (her family owns the diner), also waitressing there is her best friend Maria DeLuca. An argument between customers results in gunfire and Liz is shot. Max, unable to watch the girl he's loved from a distance for years die, heals her and thus threatens the secret existence of the 3 aliens. The scene in which Max heals Liz is the driving force of the series - it fuels the romantic tension between the two as well as placing the alien trio in under scrutiny from the local sheriff, Jim Valenti (the father of Liz's current boyfriend, Kyle), and bringing the possible alien existence to the attention of the FBI.

The best parts of this series are those that deal with the very human drama inside the science fiction frame of the series. It is very easy to identify with the fears and insecurities of these teenagers and the show explores them very successfully. The performances are strong all around and the cast is first rate.

The series is originally based on the Roswell High book series by Melinda Metz but, outside of the basics (and sharing the first scene basically word for word), the two diverge and end up about as far from each other as possible. If you're a die hard fan (maybe even if you're not) the books are worth a read.

All in all, this series makes for great entertainment as the teens try to turn the bond created by a life and death secret into friendship.

I do have a criticism for the DVD set:

When Roswell was first made, the music rights were not secured for future release; the scope of DVD technology and what it could mean for television wasn't fully realized for years and securing the rights to the music retroactively is so cost prohibitive as to prevent the series release on DVD at any time (other series face this problem as well, examples are Malcolm in the Middle and Charmed, among many others).

The Roswell team chose to reassemble the original music group and actually REPLACE music throughout the episodes (if you have the box set, you'll find an insert by Jason Katims explaining the decision). Some music is the same (the theme song 'Here With Me' by Dido, along with it's reprise at the end of the season finale, Max still heals Liz to 'Fear' by Sarah McLachlan, and frankly, no other song would have done here, so it had to stay, and 'Crash' by Dave Matthews Band is still the end of the first episode) but the vast majority is new music. While I must give them credit for putting in the effort to reassemble the people who chose the music the first time around, I have to say that the alternate music is often very poorly chosen. The songs themselves are okay, but there were some songs that I couldn't stand being replaced (Collective Soul's 'Run' in ""Independence Day"" is one of them, the song replacing it doesn't fit the scene very well). I'm not sure why they thought that they should choose songs of radically different styles from the original selections, or even songs with extremely different meanings - the new music sometimes drastically alters the feel of a scene entirely and I can't think of one example where this change is for the better.

I'll still enjoy the DVD set, though I'm not going to be taping over my VHS copies anytime soon. I just hope that when Season 2 comes out, they'll do a better job picking music.",1093910400,4,4924,4.6118721461187215
1945566,4,B0000TPA6K,"There's nothing to argue about the quality of this show and especially season 1 but those drastic music changes are really a letdown. Especially episode 10 ""Heat Wave"" has gotten a whole makeover, from the beginning which originally used Santana for the steamy Michael/Maria makeout scene to the party and right on to the end where Max and Liz first kiss and the original Gomez song that played - all that has been changed. Personally I just go back to watching my video tapes although the quality on those sucks. Oh well, buy if you don't care about the music stuff, it's still great watching this amazing show.",1093305600,2,612,4.675925925925926

However, i didn't read the reviews here and was skipping around watching the special features and listening to commentary and the first episode i saw was Tess, Lies and Videotape.  I was quite surprised that the chemistry scene that had used Sneaker Pimps' Six Underground song had now disappeared with some incredibly dull new song.  The music of the series and songs used by their music department were a big part of the driving force of a lot of the scenes and i hope they can license the other songs for any other dvds they produce.  The show was great, but really the episodes don't quite match up with the originals because it's lacking the original soundtrack.",1092268800,,736,4.595419847328245

I didn't want it to end. So Now i watch it on scifi every day at four pm. It the perfect show for people who beleive in fiction storys. And i am one of those many people. I enjoy Roswell, Charmed, Smallville, and some more great shows. But i am sitting her thinking, Why didn't i watch it when it was on the WB or UPN?

1945569,5,B0000TPA6K,"Before I saw this series, I was expecting something like Beverly Hills 90210 with your typical alien conspiracy coverup, blah blah blah.

Actually, this show is superbly done.  The characters - and that's what this show is all about - are quite unique, well acted, and very complex.  They're aliens, but that just gives them something to keep secret, something to fear.  A lot of the stories involve their relationships with us regular humans, namely their girlfriends.  The best thing about this show is that's it's original;  There's not a cliche to be found anywhere.  And that is unbelievable in the sci-fi genre.  It's also extremely funny, as some of the characters, namely Maria, are really sarcastic.

It centers around the three teenage aliens:  Max, the responsible one, also rather dark and brooding.  Micheal, the irresponsible one, he can be annoying but you can see so much of yourself in him that he's impossible to dislike.  And Isabelle, the beautiful girl who just wants to live a normal life.  Then there's Maria, Micheal's girlfriend (she's human).  She's quite a firecracker, as the saying goes.  But at the same time very vulnerable and passionate.  And of course Liz, Max's girlfriend (another human).  The story begins as she accidentally gets shot in a botched robbery at the cafe she works at, and Max brings her back to life.  That develops into a long-running relationship with Max, and brings with it the first introduction of an outsider into the alien's secret.

The show starts out being mostly about the relationships of the characters, perhaps a bit like 90210, if 90210 was ten times more mature, witty, original, believable, and just didn't generally stink.  However in Roswell, there always seem to be dark forces lurking in the background.  Who are they, and what will they do?  This forms a lot of the plot lines of later episodes.

All in all, a wonderful series.  I'd definitely recommend it - you'll be very surprised.",1091664000,,1960,4.905487804878049

1945573,5,B0000TPA6K,"Why did I not watch this show until the DVD?  I was afraid it would be BUFFY meets DAWSONS CREEK -- BUFFY's CREEK or DAWSON THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  Teen shows were hot at the time, and it was hard to keep track!  ROSWELL came along quietly with its Sci Fi metaphor - the alienation you feel as a teenager expressed by three aliens...the space kind.  It was a totally new way to revel in the timeless drama of ROMEO AND JULIET - impossible first love.  Nowhere NEAR as violent or dark as BUFFY, and also more mystical than DAWSON's CREEK - ROSWELL stands on its own quite well in this DVD set covering the first season.
The story is about alien teenagers who live as humans in Roswell, and the impact they have when their secret is outed when a random act of violence forces one of them to save the life of a girl he has loved from afar.  Secrets fester, and love rears its head as the whole town begins to suspect something is up ... especially when the FBI comes in under everyone's radar.  I gauge good Sci Fi by how much it explores what it means to be ""human"", and this series does that EXTREMELY well.
The DVDs are in widescreen, and have commentaries scattered throughout.  23 episodes, and a couple of featurettes -- one on the making of the series, and another about the BOOK SERIES this show was based on.  A GREAT CAST, a wonderful pilot and set-up, beautiful music (Dido's ""HERE WITH ME"" in the opening fits so well!), and solid stories make this definitely a DVD to check out.",1089072000,2,1485,4.332129963898917
1945574,5,B0000TPA6K,"True, following mysterious events in Roswell is no new subject. However, aliens that are basically human in everything but their blood type that allows them the abilities even most superheroes would envy. The only three downfalls of the series all together, were #1: They did not learn 95% of their powers until the second season and #2: local tv shows don't usually rake in enough dough for special effects, so they can't really use the powers at full force until season 3 which leads to #3: season 3 was given to the crudiest producers ever, UPN20 (instead of its original WB39). UPN destroyed and mutilated every chance this show had of making a fourth season.
yes, the music has changed a bit, but if you actually bought the set and did not download it illegally or copy a friend's, you can read the memo that states ""if the music was not changed, it never would have been released."" I admit, the music changes drastically effect some episodes, and 99% of the new music sounds like the exact same band from a garage with the doors shut and no real sound equipment. But I would rather have the set and not worry about it.
As far as the first season being the worst, it's not true, the third was the worst (it was the x-files on crack). The only real bad thing about the first is the fact that it took 26 episodes for them to form a cool group of central characters. the whole ""trying to keep it secret"" thing was suspensful, but also extreemly anoying.",1088380800,2,1455,4.473684210526316

In what other town are your teachers possible government agents, and local business owners the victims of alien abductions...allegedly.  And we won't even get into the secrets within Roswell High's eraser room.
Max Evens, his sister Isabel and close friend Michael, know they are different.  What they don't know is how or why.  So they hide in plane site within the kooky little town of Roswell, New Mexico.  Until the fateful day when Liz Parker (Max's long time secret love and local human) is shot right in from of him.  Unable to turn away, he heals her fatal wound and puts his life in her hands.  Thus beginning the journey of Max, Isable, Michael, Liz, Maria and Alex as they try to hide the truth from the snooping town sheriff, the persistent FBI and even their own families.
Filled with wonderful irony, and eccentric background characters, Roswell will keep you guessing, because people are rarely who they seem.",1079654400,2,1015,4.832369942196531

The first season is the best, IMO, because it has the perfect balance of sci-fi and teenage angst, which was the show's appeal.  ""Roswell"" has always been about being human and being different, and what really drew me into this show in the first place was the fact that you can feel the electricity between Max and Liz.  Their romance felt realistic and honest, rather than forced/contrived as in some other shows.  The only gripe I have is that I wish they'd kept the original music in.

Well, I must say I am very disappointed that so much music was changed (how can Max comfort Liz after grandma dies WITHOUT Sarah McLachlan playing?).  I recorded every episode, but didn't watch them a lot since the quality was poor.  In turn I don't remember every song so I can't really tell what has been changed other than a handful of songs, or should I say it's not a big enough deal to stress over.
The show is so great on its own that I still rate it five stars though.  The extras are pretty good, and I like the widescreen format.  Get it for sure!

This show was so intense, so unique, so gripping, that it created a fan base that other TV shows have never seen.  Roswell fans rallied together to not only save the show, but they also ralled together for charity causes in the name of the stars, the writers, the show, etc.
A show has got to be THAT good to move people to such lengths!  If you have never seen this series and would like something that will have you on the edge of your seat, then you will NOT be unhappy!

I started watching Roswell in the latter half of the second second(which I'm looking foward to purchasing) and came to enjoy the show.  The only thing that was different and which was addressed by the executive producer was the some of the music throughtout the shows.  The plot, storyline and the acting was superb.  Plus the extras are something to look foward to.  If you are a Smallville fan or enjoy shows of that genre this DVD set is for you, the money spent is worth it.",1079136000,3,570,4.339622641509434

1945611,5,B0000TPA6K,"I remember watching this series during this first season, but I had forgotten how addictive it grew in my schedule to watch it. It is a wonderfully crafted mixture of sci-fi and teen drama, softly flavored with edgy, intelligent dialogues. Liz Parker is a teenager who gets shot in the restaurant owned by her parents, and is then saved by another teenager, who lays hands on her. Max Evans is then forced to tell her his secret: he, his sister and his friend Michael, are, indeed, aliens. From that point the three aliens begin the path of connecting emotionally with humans (who they have avoid their whole life, and include Liz's friends: Maria and Alex) as they have to face the dangers around them. Sheriff Valenti is the most relentless menace for their secret throughout the season. It is most remarkable (as it is with other series like Buffy and The X-Files) the metaphoric level of the stories. My favorite episodes of the season are: Missing: Liz has written all her secrets (and Max's) in a journal, and it is now missing; the paranoic feeling of this episode is very well achieved and keeps one wondering who is onto them. 285 south: Michael ""abducts"" Maria so he can use her car to get to a place where he believes there are clues to know his true origin; he is followed by the very cautious Max along with Isabel and Liz... but two menaces are following their tracks. River Dog: after finding a symbol in a necklace, Max contacts an indian who knew the fourth alien they have been looking for. Heat Wave: this episode is hot from the very teaser... Maria and Michael kiss (and a bit more) while Liz sees them, this encourages her to make a move towards Max. Blind Date: after being dumped by Max, Liz finds new posibilities with the help of Maria, but her night gets complicated after Max gets drunk and begins his conquest efforts all over again... only a bit out of control this time. Independence Day: Michael feels agains the wall, as he gets hit by his foster father and realizes that this is one thing he has nothing in common with the other aliens... he turns then to Maria. Sexual Healing: this one is even hotter than heat Wave... Max and Liz kiss and she begins to have flashes of the crash in the 40s. So they try to take their contact as far as they can, in order to discover what happened back then. Crazy: Topolski (the FBI agent who spies on them during the first half of the season posing as a guidance couselor) returns after being tortured by an FBI agent who is onto Max... she tries to warn the kids, but they don't trust her. Max to the Max: Liz is taken by Nasedo (the shapeshifter alien known as Nasedo) in an effort of the alien to mislead agent Pierce and have then an opportunity to kill him... but by the end of the episode, it is the real Max who falls in the hands of the alien hunter. The White Room: Max is tortured by agent Pierce, while his friends try to find a way to rescue him. Destiny: As the whole group tries to escape from agent Pierce, they find the most unexpected ally: sheriff Valenti. By the end of the episode, great revelations destroy relationships. This is a really enjoyable show, particularly because of the great counterpoint that the viewer finds between the very well designed characters: the main couple's love finds a very interesting undercut in Michael and Maria's, as Max's cautiousness is completed dramatically by Michael's ruthless behaviour, and their passionate devotion to different endeavors finds an interesting counterpoint in Isabel's dettachment. The same goes for the human characters. Maria is perhaps the character with the best lines (""Topolsky is a plant"") and attitudes... she can deliver the funniest moments of an episode, as well as the most painfull (mainly because she represses her pain and finds a way to make it more interesting, through agression or humor). It is most remarkable the development of the Valenti character, as well as William Sadler performance.
The other great thing about this package (the box is not as compelling as the ones from other Fox releases, such as Buffy, The Simpsons or The X-Files) are the extras. I thought it was going to have more, but I was satisfied by the ones to be found. The featurettes are interesting and enjoyable. But, the best extras are the Shiri Appleby and Majandra Delfino's commentaries: they are probably the funniest commentaries I've ever heard in any DVD. Jason Katims and David Nutter's commentaries are very insightfull about the process of creation, Thania St-John's explained very well the metaphors and the dramatical development of an episode (it made me like much more ""The Balance"": I went, oh! of course!). But Shiri and Majandra's let one know some of those details of the making which are worth to know (there were some tales that really made laugh so hard, I thought I was going to pull a Michael -wait to hear what he did in a lake and for a bet... it is just hilarious). I hope they do more commentaries for seasons 2 and 3, but it would be nice to hear them along with the other cast members.
This show really explores the boundaries of the development of a subject, of an individuall... how human can one be, from whence come those impulses that lead us to mistakes, those that make us feel embarrased or that lift us up to a heaven as imposible to grasp as the universe itself.",1078963200,6,5349,4.6079664570230605

The DVD set is great and I like that each of the 6 DVDs comes with its own case.  Can't wait for the rest of the series on DVD, especially season 3.",1078876800,,496,4.01010101010101

I expected the price to damage the wallet but it is rather cheap. The quality is 100% no faults, no hassle, and the packaging is efficient and takes on a new meaning to dvd viewing.
The absolute gripping factor of the Roswell series keeps you stuck to your seat as every episode leads on to the next at a fundamental point, which keeps you enthralled and excited to see where the next Episode leads Max, Michael, Isabel, and their friends. The Romance, Sci-Fi, Action, and drama elements create a vast viewing entertainment that promises total satisfaction in every episode.
If you aren't a devoted Roswell supporter, it makes no difference because once you see the season 1 you will without doubt be back for the Seasons 2,3.

1945615,5,B0000TPA6K,"After finally receiving the long awaited release of Season 1 of one of my favorite shows of all time...I was thrilled!  I took my time viewing each of the 6 DVD's in this box set.  They include all 22 of the first season's episodes.  Unfortunately, I worked my way through the shows too quickly and now the wait begins for Season 2 to be released.  The show is great as always and it is so nice to have the DVD quality without the commercials from television.  Therefore, I give it the 5 star rating without hesitation.  Nevertheless, some of the special features that are listing on Amazon.com are not actually on the DVDs themselves.  That list of Special Features is inaccurate.  I did not have a Gag Reel on mine and neither did I have commentary by Colin Hanks (which I was looking forward to).  Mostly, it had 3 or 4 commentaries by the writers, producers, and directors that were pretty boring.  It did have 2 great episodes with commentary by Shiri Appleby and Majandra Delfino that were rather enjoyable.  Otherwise, the short interview segment on the last disk and the other couple of features were very short and not really that great at all.  There was only one deleted scene and they should have been able to include so much more.  I'm not sure if it was a funding issue or if whomever put it together just made bad choices.  There was a note inside my box set from Jason Katims stating that they did have to cut out most of the original music from the series due to the budget that they were under to release an affordable box set.  Honestly, I couldn't tell the difference in the music choices.  It sounded great to me.  They kept the same theme song and most of the songs from the original pilot episode (like Dave Matthews ""Crash Into Me"") which were irreplaceable.  This doesn't in any way take away from the quality of the episodes which are worth the purchase price alone.  My only suggestion is that they improve the special features on the second season which is reportedly coming out this summer.  I can't wait!",1078790400,4,2034,4.505464480874317

This was a quality show that explored the same kind of dual-life dynamic that Buffy had.  I was also attached to the characters, which is an indication that they were developed rather than  character-types.  Good writing, well acted and well structured mysteries.  When I opened the package I found a disclaimer leaflet citing that due to licensing restrictions, some of the songs on the soundtrack had to be replaced.  For the most part, I did not notice, but there was a scene in particular (""Independence Day"") where I would have liked to have heard Collective Soul's ""Run"" in the scene.  It just did not have the same emotional punch as when I saw that scene the first time.  Thank goodness for  Majandra Delfino and Brendan Fehr's chemistry.  On the whole, I am judging the story-telling quality of this series as opposed to the features and I strongly suggest this to any fan of Roswell, Buffy or Angel.",1078704000,,1008,4.6440677966101696

I always preffered the drama/teen angst storylines more than the Sci-Fi storylines which muddled the second season. If you never really got into it on TV, watch this first season.  You'll love it.
The quality of the DVD is very good, and I like the fact that its in (1.85:1) letterbox.  Since I only recorded the show to make sure I didn't miss it, the episodes look better than any of my tape recordings ever did.
I would have liked more extras, but at least some of the ep. have commentary by Shiri & Majandra.  I hope the other seasons have some of the other actors and maybe more video clips/deleted scenes.
For all those wondering about the music change.  It was due to the cost of using the  music on the DVD.  The rights to use it on a TV show are seperate from the right to sell a DVD.  They used similar styled Pop/Alt. music for the background scenes. Some fits better than others.
Dido is still at the start of the show !  And some of the ""important scenes"" kept the original music, Jason Katims the producer has a little flyer in the box explaning it.
The DVD set is not feature packed like some other TV show sets, but is not bad.  Just maybe a little ""plain"" for a cult TV show but still worth the cost.",1077753600,3,1388,4.180451127819549

What they don't disclose is that they have changed the music in some scenes. I have only watched two episodes ""River Dog and ""Blood Brother"" so I don't know how much they have ruined the episodes. The originals worked, they should have left well enough alone. Unless they could not get the rights to the songs. Who knows.

1945628,5,B0000TPA6K,"This is hands down the best series I have ever enjoyed.  I was hooked from the very first episode, and I have undeniably and unchangeably thrown myself into the large hopelessly devoted fans group.  As a true fan, the only things that I find these DVDs lacking in are the music (point to other DVD series that were able to keep their original scores), and more deleted scenes.  After how long we've waited and the fight we've endured to get this here, we feel a little disappointed that our beloved series is not here in its true form.
  Now, on to the good stuff.  The characters are strong and the plot is perfectly paced.  The romantic moments are neither too fast nor too slow, and they are definitely not so often that they interfere with the rest of the story, and what an action story it is.
  The appeal of a group who is so intimately connected in such an unbreakable bond touches a part in all of us that needs to feel a part of something bigger and more important than the lives we've had so far, and yet the close-knit union that they share is just as desirable.  The story of 3 teenage aliens who find that they are not as alone as they thought, and 3 teenage humans who find out the same thing from the other side of the path, strikes a chord in all of us.  The laughter and joy, pain and grief, and the loss and survival that the characters experience will have you laughing and crying and cheering alongside them.  You'll find that the mistakes and lessons learned, and the trials and setbacks experienced are a lot of the same ones that you've had in your own life and in that way the characters become more real and lovable.
  Don't miss out on this must-have for any sci-fi lover or lover in general.  And remember to be what you are, and do what you want, just don't hide your devotion until the next season.",1077235200,6,1828,4.319648093841642

There are extras (such as commentary by some of the cast, producers, etc. and deleted scenes for some episodes).  The fact that there is a scene selection for each episode is also very handy.

In my opinion, Season 1 is the ""premier"" season in Roswell's three year run on television.  The sci-fi audience that is enamored with Buffy The Vampire Slayer & Angel (both decent shows) should look more to Season 2 & Season 3 when they are released.  Season 1 has often been characterized as ""slow and boring"" by this particular segment of the Roswellian population.
Be aware that there are some dramatic music changes that were made to make the dvd affordable.  And yes (as a previous reviewer mentioned), it does have a negative impact on a couple of very important scenes.  It was a tough compromise that will probably anger quite a few fans.

Someone has already mentioned this, but what the producers had to do because of high copyright costs is replace a lot of (probably most, I'm guessing) the original music from the show with other music.  I immediately popped in a disk that had on it the episode with one of my favorite moments from the series on it - the ending of ""Missing"" when Max, Michael, and Isabel find the dome from Michael's vision in the book and Counting Crows ""Colorblind"" begins to play in the background - and I started to cry - they had replaced ""Colorblind"" with something else.  It changed the whole vibe, feel and mood to the whole scene!!  I didn't think I would have such an emotional reaction, but it broke my heart.  I now own the first season of a show I truly loved and parts from the show that I loved BECAUSE OF the music ARE NOT as they were when I fell in love with them.  I can't believe I bought a season of a television show on DVD and it is not in it's original form.  I feel cheated because I didn't know this before I made the purchase.  If I had known, I probably wouldn't have.  I can't believe I won't be able to re-live one of my favorite shows as it existed in it's original form.  I'm afraid to watch the rest for fear that I will continue to have my heart broken.  To anyone who has yet to purchase the DVD set - if Roswell is as near and dear to your heart as it is to mine, I might re-think purchasing this set.",1077062400,14,1710,4.068656716417911

The one thing that I didn't like was that they changed the music from the original episode airings, and the original stuff was better.  But if you never watched this show, give it a chance.  It was a great show; it had creepy aliens, mushy romance, and constant action every week.  Add this set to your collection, you won't regret it.",1077062400,,449,4.373493975903615
1945635,4,B0000TPA6K,"Roswell went through a lot of turmoil in its short life. Relaunched. Almost cancelled. Cancelled. Moved network. Cancelled again. But it achieved more in its three seasons than many shows do in twice that time.
Season one is reasonably sappy, but still enjoyable for the most part. Probably the highlight of the first season is the recurring guest spot for Julie Benz (aka Darla from Buffy). But the show really comes into its own towards the end of season one, when the show was relaunched. At this point it took a distinctly sci-fi twist and became a compelling drama. It went from watchable, to unmissable in just one episode.
In particular, I'd compare this show to Buffy. If you're a Buffy fan I'd highly recommend Roswell, as it mixes the same elements of a young cast and brilliant -- and sometimes shocking -- drama.
If you watched Roswell but gave up in season one, I definitely suggest getting the DVDs and giving them another go. The relaunch changes everything, and takes the show into a totally new level.
So even if you decided Roswell wasn't for you, take another look.",1077062400,2,1084,4.7105263157894735

Shiri Appleby and Majandra Delfino were hilarious in their commentary, and just added a great feeling to the DVD. The story line of Roswell is so fantastic of these teenager aliens trying to fit in highschool and the trials they face. I believe this was one of the best teenage dramas, and encourage fans to fork over the money to buy it!",1076976000,,478,4.322222222222222
1945637,5,B0000TPA6K,"Got mine from Amazon.com today (9:30am the day it came out; so much for 2-day shipping)! I've watched the pilot episode and some of the extras.
First big thing to note: regardless of what Amazon or anyone else says, the episodes are widescreen! I had heard that the US version would be fullscreen while other versions were widescreen; it's nice to see that this is not the case.
I know people are concerned about the music. First of all, Fox makes it very clear on the box that some of the music is new (in traditional marketing form, ""Includes cutting-edge songs selected by the original Roswell music team!""). Inside the case is an insert by the executive producer, Jason Katims, explaining his reasons for changing the music. He mentions some of the songs that they kept (Sarah Mclachlan during the healing scene, Dave Matthews during the pilot episode, and the Dido theme). That combined with the Roswell Season 2 insert shows dedication to the fans (who pushed so hard to get this DVD released).
Amazon lists the commentary wrong so here it goes:
""Pilot"" - Jason Katims and David Nutter
""Blood Brother"" - David Nutter
""The Balance"" - Thania St. John
""Sexual Healing"" - Shiri Appleby and Majandra Delfino
""Crazy"" - Shiri Appleby and Majandra Delfino
""Destiny"" - Jason Katims and Patrick Norris
There are a couple of featurettes: one behind the scenes (""Area 51"") and the other is a making-of (""Roswell High"" - this one deals with the books). The Tess audition tape is great as well.
And the episodes themselves are great. I don't know the original music well enough for the changes to bother me. Just being able to watch this show anytime is enough for most Roswell fans. There are enough reviews here about the show itself so I won't go into that.

1945638,5,B0000TPA6K,"To think it all started with Jason Behr's guest appearances on Dawson's Creek. Viewers of ""The Creek"" will remember him as Chris, the ""rico suave"" who acted in one of Dawson's movies. Apparently, ""the powers that be"" saw potential in Behr, thus Jason Katim's sci-fi teen drama was developed and formed around him. More recently, The Creek did the same thing for Chad Michael Murray, currently of One Tree Hill.

Immediately engaging and involving, Roswell raised the bar somewhat for teen dramas with an incredible cast, original storylines, and a near-perfect balance of sci-fi elements and teen angst. There's no wonder why so many have so much to express about the phenomenon that is Roswell. Life was good for Roswell until it started losing support during it's 2nd season due to what TV Guide Couch Critic Matt Roush called ""convoluted storylines."" ""Too much stuff going on,"" he said. Yeah, right. In any case, WB dropped Roswell (along with Buffy) from it's schedule. Luckily, UPN picked up Roswell (along with Buffy) for the show's 3rd and final season. For its worth, Roswell went out fighting like a champ (along with my other canceled favorite of that year, ABC's Once & Again) with one of television's better series finales. Treat yourself to arguably the most anticipated DVD you'll buy this year.

On behalf of all American Roswell fans, I can say that when we found out some time ago that the DVD's were being released in the UK, but not in the US, we were all devastated.  But when we found out that we would be getting a release as well....shall I say that the response was overwhelming.
I am just hoping that we can provide enough of a monetary response that the ""powers that be"" will release the other two seasons.
We are highly dedicated fans, like others for many other series, and will do our best to make producers realize that there is a secondary market for our favorite series.  I am just hoping that they will listen.",1076112000,2,680,4.255813953488372

ROSWELL definitely got under our skin and into our hearts :)...
Hope you all enjoy slipping this little bit of magic into your DVD players. If you're new to it, I very much envy you. You're in for a huge treat. I know that when I'm through viewing those 6 disks I'm going to be PINING bigtime for the next batch. Season Two was a whole 'nother thing, but equally startling. I can't wait :)!
And I've got to say.. any DVD that has already generated 73 reviews (even before it's been released?!?) says something powerful about how the characters effected us :). Many blessings to everyone involved for having created such an amazing and entangling story.

1945643,5,B0000TPA6K,"I write this with the all the sincerity I can muster. This show is unbelievable. I watched the first time it came out on the WB and when it was moved to another channel (at the end of the second season) that does no reach Puerto Rico i was heart broken. You will never see another show that can rival this one in emotion, complexity, action, drama, comedy, romance... absolutely anything. If you really think about it: the show is about three alien teens and their friends here on earth that know their secret and how they fight for their lives. To keep a show like this one real and believable you NEED the writer, director, actors... EVRYTHING to be absolutely amazing, which it is. I cried and laughed and got really depressed, I mean how can you watch Jason Behr (Max Evans: the reaaly good looking guy on the cover) and not get depressed because one: you can't have him, Two: you can't be him (if your a guy)and three because everytime his face falls and is wheighed with emotion you want to make the world a better Alien Accepting place.

1945644,5,B0000TPA6K,"Again this is the most enrapturing love story I have ever seen on TV.  And they're only teenagers!!!! And to top it all off they have more than the normal insecurities to deal with. . . they literally have to hide who and what they are.  That's a lot to handle and I thought this show pulled it off with flying colors.
Granted the 1st season was the best of the 3.  I didn't not like season 2 but I did feel as though it was a little less thought out.  And season 3 just rushed us to the end (nice last episode though).  Liz and Max showed us that love involved loyalty, doing things for someone you cared about and holding on to each other as you leap into the unknown.  They made it a point to say it wasn't all about Sex.  Something teenagers who watch the show should definitely see.  The actors were superb and the writing in the beginning gave this show characters that were believable and engrossing.
The sci-fi part wasn't all encompasing but there was enough to the plot that you knew the special effects would have to escalate even though the 3 aliens really wanted to just fit in.
I completely feel in love with this show and I am awfully sorry that it has been taken off the air.  Though if they ever decide to continue the story they'll need some really good actors (or bring back the old ones) because the chemistry was real and powerful.  And there is a lot rogue adults can do that teenagers tied to the apron strings can not.
Thanks to crashdown.com and those who logged in for trying very hard to keep this show alive!",1076025600,,1536,4.26551724137931
1945645,5,B0000TPA6K,"in all honesty, it was by chance that i saw the rerun of this pilot.  and since that time, i have been hooked.  season 1 is the best season of the 3.  you deal with not only alien hybrids but the figurative aspect of being alienated, as many high schoolers have felt in their own lifetime.  that milestone of your first crush/love and the akwardness these teens feel along with the ongoing looking over your shoulder, roswell has got it all.
you may relate to the angsty love between max and liz, or relate to liz's zany friend, maria. or the silent but ever reliable alex.  or you could be the jock, kyle. then there's the loner, michael and the teen queen isabel.  these characters such you in.

1945646,4,B0000TPA6K,"I received a review copy of this DVD. All of the extras that they promise are not actually on the DVD. There is one deleted scene and six episodes with commentary, but there are only two featurettes and one audition tape for Emilie de Ravin. No outtakes or anything like that.
The only other real disappointment was the change in some of the songs within the episodes. Heatwave doesnt seem the same without Santana pounding out Put Your Lights On during Michael and Marias first heavy make-out scene. And while the new cutting-edge song that the Roswell music team found for that scene at the window in Independence Day was an appropriate song, I kept hearing Run in my head while Michael stood outside in the rain.
In spite of all this, the DVD set still exemplifies why season 1 was the best season of Roswell. Even though some of the songs have changed, the picture is crystal clear - a lot better than most of my tapes are right now. And the commentaries offer a lot of insight into behind the scenes on the Roswell set. Listen to Shiri and Majandra comment on Sexual Healing and Crazy. Those are probably the best two.
If you're a fan, buy this set. If you're not a fan, buy this set and realize why so many people fought so hard to save Roswell two seasons in a row. While the extras aren't everything that was promised, the DVD itself brings back enough memories to make it worth it.",1075852800,6,1390,4.43359375

But the audience really gets into the lives of the characters, the sweet relationships and exciting adventures, so it's an easy show to get addicted to, just give it a chance! The only thing that could be better then this dvd is a season two dvd, which i think is the best season. Hopefully that will come soon!

1945648,3,B0000TPA6K,"Some people say watch the first episode and forget the rest but I'd give Roswell a litle more credit than that. The first episode where Liz Parker discovers that there really are Aliens in Roswell was one of the better episodes but I found myself liking many of the episodes at least for their creativity. Isn't first season the one in which one of the guardian aliens teaches his young protoge that he can get through the government ID scanner by changing his finger prints? ( the scanner was designed to detect a shapeshifter like the guardian by detecting their lack of a skeleton which humans and the young aliens all have).
I thought at first that the end of season episodes introducing a fourth alien, ""Tess"", were in fact from second season (I first saw them on the SciFi channel) but learned otherwise. This is an example, these episodes took the show off on a new angle, of the increasing sloppiness that The WB and then UPN took with the series.

The first season of Roswell, or more accurately, the first 16 episodes of Roswell, is some of the greatest young adult programming I've ever seen.

1945659,4,B0000TPA6K,"While I always felt the show carried too much of the Dawson Creek angst, I missed most of the first season because of it. I had wanted to watch it regularly, mostly because of former Star Trek The Next Generation actor Jonathan Frakes association with the show -he was an excutive producer and directed several episodes. But like I said, the first season reminded me of the Creek with aliens. It got boring very quick, and besides, the shows seemed to no where. The show did have an appealing cast, which made it ten times better than Dawson. Jason Behr is hot, and should've been bare chested more often, and I always thought they should've made Nick Wechsler's character gay. I mean, hello, he was way too girlie. Still, he was hot also. Shiri Appleby's Liz and Majandra Delfino's Maria were wonderful, well rounded characters, but William Sadler's Sheriff was silly until he discovers the truth about the guys. All in all, season one was okay. I liked season two, when the show really became a sci fi show. Ironically, most fans did not like that season and when it jumped to UPN for it's third and final season, the show returned more to the Dawson Creek style of story telling. And the Colin Hank's character was missed by then, and well the show never recovered. The show never really found a balance between the sci fi and teen stuff. So the fan base became goofed up by it. There was one camp that liked the love, teen thing, while others didn't mind the teen stuff, but wanted more sci fi.

The chemistry of the cast and the charisma/star power of its lead, Jason Behr, left me at the edge of my seat after every episode. A mix of action, sci-fi and drama all woven with an incrediable love story that always kept me wanting more-Roswell was unforgetable! Season 1 was, as previously reviewed, the far superior episodes.  I attribute this to the uneeded introduction of the character of Tess.  Falling back on an overused plotline of bringing in a ""new girl"" to cause conflict among the lead couple (Max and Liz) was lazy and hurt season 2.  By the time they figured it out and gave her the boot Season 3 was already struggling.  I wonder now if Roswell would have performed better on Fox (the network it was intended for).  At the time the WB was not available in enough states for a show to grow slowly to success as I believe would have been the case with Roswell.  Season 1, however, is a must see!

A note to the WB, How can they wonder why there male viewing population has dwindled, it's because they make BAD decisions regarding good shows.

The show's plot is wonderful and the characters amazing. It starts with three aliens desperately trying to hide in plain sight...but when Maxwell's love of his life, Elizabeth Parker, becomes mortally injured, he exposes them all...and for your information he would do it again if he had to.

Maria and Michael are two of the best side kicks ever devised in Television history. Alex also brings a certain charm to the screen in his attempts to woe over the Ice Queen and keep close to his best friends.

The cast is amazing, the story is amazing. Roswell...is ...amazing.

Live it. Love it.
Buy it!",1070064000,4,988,4.590909090909091

1945670,5,B0000TPA6K,"I just wanted to point out that of all the reviews on this site so far, all but one person have giving this series 5 stars.  I think our views might change after we watch the dvds with the different music but even so, I'm thinking that will make Roswell a whole new experience.  It'll be like watching it for the first time!  I can't wait to watch them!  And for producers reading these reviews, PLEASE RELEASE SEASONS 2 AND 3 AS WELL!",1069804800,4,435,4.204819277108434
1945671,5,B0000TPA6K,I loved Roswell and it too is my favorite tv show of all time.  I must applaude the releasing of season 1 and beg that season two and three be released also.  This is a wish that has taken a long time to be fulfilled but it was worth the wait.  I recommend Roswell to anyone looking for a good time.,1069459200,4,299,3.8688524590163933
1945672,5,B0000TPA6K,"I would have to completely agree that this series was way too short. Only a brief 3 seasons!!! My sister and I were completely heart broken when we saw the last episode. There was such a small sense of closure!! They tried to cram an ending into one episode. Which, I have to admit, they did quite a good job considering the amount of time they were given as a notice ;)
I love Roswell and I will be FIRST in line to buy all 3 seasons on DVD.",1069459200,4,442,3.9775280898876404

i cannot wait!!",1068940800,2,266,4.3
1945676,5,B0000TPA6K,"The 1st season of Roswell was one of the best of any show I've watched.  It uses the same formula as Buffy and Smallville--teenagers who have extraordinary abilities trying to cope in a normal highschoolers life.  If you like those shows, you'll enjoy this one.
One note about Roswell.  It was not renewed after the first season.  An unprecedented internet petition campaign brought the show back.  The effect this has on the show is as follows.  The last episode of the 1st season was intended as the final episode for the series.  I was thrilled as anyone that the show was brought back.  That is until I saw the 1st show of the second season.  That episode deviated so far from what had been established in the first season that I stopped watching after that.
My advice, buy the 1st season, rent the first episode of the 2nd to confirm that it is indeed what I have claimed it to be and try to forget what you saw.",1068940800,,917,4.410714285714286
1945677,5,B0000TPA6K,"An extraordinary show that touched the hearts of many, ""Roswell"" was cut short after only three seasons.  Jason Behr, Shiri Appleby, Katherine Heigl and the rest of the cast brought to life such wonderful, lovable characters.  Every week, the show explored a double-edged sword of fantasy/reality as the series tugged at the hearts of it's loyal fans.  Whether it was sending bottles of Tabasco sauce or any other method of showing support to the show, ""Roswell"" fans are truly devoted and it's a sad loss to see the show end after 3 short years.  From the moment Max saved the life of Liz, to the day they were married, these two star-crossed lovers made it impossible for people not to love ""Roswell.""  Don't miss out - get your copy of season one and live the magic that touched so many hearts.",1068508800,4,797,4.624113475177305
1945678,5,B0000TPA6K,"At long last, one of the most original and gripping TV shows comes out on DVD! The suspense, drama, romance and human interest of season one will have you on the edge of your seat waiting for seasons two and three to make their DVD debut. Aliens Max, Isabel and Michael, imbued with human DNA and assimilated into Roswell's human society, desperately try to keep their real origin secret from the local sheriff, the government and the FBI---out of fear and necessity. Though alien, they're the ""good guys"" trying to merely survive in a world of cynical and threatening humans. Their narrow escapes and their desire to remain apart from and still interrelate with humans makes for very interesting viewing. ""The White Room"", a late first-season episode, ranks with some of the most suspenseful and action-filled plots in the history of television. This is one DVD set you won't see on the ""used"" block. Buy it---you will definitely want to keep it!",1067904000,5,947,4.851851851851852

1945680,5,B0000TPA6K,Roswell is the best show I've ever seen and I only wished they would have released this DVD collection a long time ago before I wasted my money on poor imitations. Roswell explores the alien crash in a way that's never been done. The aliens look just like us and they are just trying to survive without being captured and locked up in white rooms by the FBI. The horror of them being captured is shown in the episode the White Room. Their are many wonderful episodes in this collection.,1067644800,5,486,4.411111111111111
1945681,5,B0000TPA6K,"I am so glad that the first season of Roswell will finally be released on DVD! Like other reviewers said, Roswell is the perfect combination of science fiction and teen angst. There is something for everyone!
I don't think Roswell every really gained ""mainstream"" popularity, but the show had and still has a very loyal fan base who love the show just as much as we did when it was still on the air.
I had a very tough time in high school, and, though it may sound stupid or whatever, I will always be grateful for Roswell. It gave me something to look forward to each week. So...thank you to the powers-that-be for releasing the first season, and I hope to see the other seasons out on DVD as well!",1067299200,2,699,4.343511450381679

I can hardly wait until Feb. 17. Roswell is the best show out there. It can be watched by pretty much all ages. I would pay any amount of money for these DVD's.",1067212800,,329,4.15625

Best tv series, ever, and close to my old heart, as a believer.  Jason Katims is pure genius.  Actors are amazingly talented.  It's shot beautifully, and edited perfectly.  Direction is the best!  Everything about it is great.  Omg, Jason Behr is the most beautiful human ever created, yes?!  And a brilliantly innate actor.  I'm amazed at the skill he shows so young!

8002699,2,B0000TPA6K,Dissapointing. A great show but not the original music that the show had when aired. The reason many people rewatch a show is to feel the same emotions they felt when originally watching it. Thats hard to do when they've replaced the original music that aired with the show with new music. That's what they've done to this re-release. Its a disappointment.

8002701,3,B0000TPA6K,"This is not a show review but a review of video and audio quality. The version presented here and on other digital platforms has been resized such that information on the top and bottom of the screen image has been cropped off. The DVD versions offer the original version, in full, of each season, except for unfortunate song replacements throughout each season. The digital versions are not sourced from the masters and may have been taken from the television masters (not the celluloid masters/film masters) which would explain why they resized to fill the screen and emulate a full 16:9 presentation when what they started with was 4:3 presentation.

I hate to say it but they should have stuck with the 4:3 ratio, as it would have looked significantly better, having not been magnified so much but also having retained so much of the sets we are losing in the cropped version. The sound is the same as on the other digital presentations, including the Netflix digital version, a little muffled and oddly changeable, with peaks and troughs in volume, as though someone fiddled with the controls when they were transferring the show. This is not Amazon's fault as there is only one digital version of Roswell. It is likely the best digital presentation we will get and is worth it to play in the background, if that is your purpose.

With that being said, if you are looking to sit and watch, and I meant sit and watch intently while doing nothing else, then you should seek out the DVD releases of this wonderful show as the quality is significantly better and the DVDs do upscale well, as compared to the digital version which is clearly in SD and never comes close to looking like the faux-720p upscale most upscaled DVDs give us on our 1080p televisions. That upscaling illusion really does make all the difference with low resolution content and the digital presented here just doesn't do that well on upconversion. The DVDs look pretty much the same on our 1080p television as on our old 720p and both are leagues ahead of the old 480p we keep in a tiny office and never use. Still, we bought the series on digital and enjoy playing it in the background and I'm sure some of you will as well, if the picture quality is not as important to you and if the volume variability doesn't bother you. I hope this helps you to make your choice about which form of this wonderful show you prefer.",1515542400,5,2394,4.617370892018779
