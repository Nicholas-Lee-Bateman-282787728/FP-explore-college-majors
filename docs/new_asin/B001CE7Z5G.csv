8287290,5,B001CE7Z5G,"I practiced Namaste Yoga via television show for two years. It is SO much better to not have to forward through or tolerate commercials and to be able to choose to cool down or skip the cool down due to lack of time!
Awesome product!",1311811200,,233,4.2
8287291,1,B001CE7Z5G,"Namaste yoga, Volumes IV-VI were not what I'd expected.  They were not new material, but material already done in the TV series.  Also, there were three 20 minute workouts per disk, and the last workout was the same on each disk.  Incidentally, the last workout was the same on Volumes I-III, which also were repeats.  I thought the price was excessive for a total of 7 workouts, and already had the TV series which is much less expensive for lots more material.  I also thought the restocking fee was a little much, when you could not see what was on the disks without opening the box.  I will be much more careful should I buy another DVD online.",1305849600,4,648,4.4491525423728815
8287292,5,B001CE7Z5G,"I loved doing this on Fit Tv when I had verizon service every evening at 6 and every morning at 8:30.

This is a hatha vinyasa workout that is calming yet has a dynamic flow to it. Certain balancing poses really do tone the arm and legs.  All in all, its wonderful for a beginner to advanced alike.

You are also guided by the wonderful Kate Potter, whose voice is soothing so you do not have to look at the screen every minute. (It is said the director of sound and music for the series, timed the music with kate potter's breathing, thats quite the interesting fact)",1280534400,5,568,4.289719626168225
8287293,3,B001CE7Z5G,"I liked these workouts on Fit TV but was hoping for extended version for home use.  Would like to see a 45 minute nonstop yoga workout incorporating the essence of the show.  After short workouts, to keep going one must button press and then start all over with warm-up and end in cool down.",1271894400,8,291,4.37037037037037
8287294,5,B001CE7Z5G,"I WAS an out-of-shape beginner when I started this yoga on FIT TV 18 months ago.  I tried it because my balance was bad and I couldn't sit cross-legged on the floor.

When I got tired of the commercials I bought both years.  It was the best gift I've ever given myself.  The 25 minute segments are long enough to be effective, short enough to fit into a busy day, and diverse enough so I don't get bored.  I don't miss a day; and it's not because I'm into exercise.

You'll notice after a few weeks of practice, if you smile along with the gurus you'll get an endorphin rush--the same thing as a runner's high without the shin splints.  Amazing.  I feel so good after each workout that I now have the energy to do other things.  I recently took up roller blading (and my balance is great!) and I now belly dance, also for the joy of it.

Bottom line, after years of forking over cash for health clubs, weight watchers, and exercise balls, I now just put in the dvd and my energy soars while my weight stabilized.

Yes, the prices have gone up.  Yes, the dvds are worth it.",1268092800,9,1072,4.226600985221675
8287295,5,B001CE7Z5G,This is one of the many yoga DVD's i've tried and I must say that it's the best out there. Word of caution though: if you have back problems I don't recommend it.,1239667200,4,162,3.9393939393939394
8287296,5,B001CE7Z5G,"I feel in love with these workouts when I first saw them on my boy friends cable. I had him record them all and I did them every day. In just a month or two I was feeling much more flexable and less stressed.

Though I would not recommend to thoose on a beginer level because if you are not sure what you are doing you can get hurt. This was not my first yoga experience.

I love the very end cool down - I even do that sometimes just to relax myself on work breaks ( i work from home lol) or when my body is a little sore.

It is pretty easy to follow but you might have to watch a few of them one time through before attempting - and they do give variations for thoose at a beginer level...

If you enjoy this and keep at it can be a great workout!

just wish that the prices was a little lower :( or i would buy it in a heart beat!",1222041600,5,834,3.742857142857143
