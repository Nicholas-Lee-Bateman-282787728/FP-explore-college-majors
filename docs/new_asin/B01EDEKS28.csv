8758386,4,B01EDEKS28,"Now Add Honey isn't a movie that youll be probably ever think about much the next day after youve watched it, let alone years into the future.  But it more than entertains for the hour and a half or so it takes you to watch it.  It doesnt have any big name actors in it, who theyve used is top Australia radio network/TV spinoff show star Hamish Blake as the draw card who plays the social klutz vet who is sort of the doormat character to his fianc&eacute;e.  Theres also a few other less successful but still recognisable comedians in other minor roles in the mother characters workplace.

Now Add Honey though is a film that revolves around female characters.  All the main screen time characters are female, theres a few males in minor roles and males in this one are even villains or doormats.  Robyn Butler (who also wrote the film) plays Caroline, the mother of the household who has arranged to take her family who don't really want to go, out to breakfast. But they're not really going to breakfast, instead she secretly has them picking up her American sister from the airport who has also brought along her child (teen) star daughter Honey. Who is sort of a Bindi Irwin level teen celebrity. Not real sure why the family wouldnt get suspicious going to breakfast at an airport.

The American sister (played by Ellens wife) is a self centred woman who uses her daughter to increase her own wealth and fame, and had previously written a book on her Australian family that doesnt paint them in a good light, especially her younger sister who she refers to as fat even though she isnt, in fact shes probably in the best shape of all the female characters in the movie, played by Lucy Durack.  Its not long after their arrival that the police turn up with her missing luggage and arrest her for importing drugs (the ones she plans to consume) and threatening the life of the hotels chef after she fled into the kitchen. Caroline makes a deal with the cops to put her in rehab instead of jail and takes responsibility for Honey.  Honey is used to personal trainers, personal chefs, dieticians and well basically getting whatever she wants. Carolines home however is a dysfunctional family, where her husband sleeps in a separate room.  Unbeknownst to Caroline her sister had planned on exploiting Honeys life for the short term large amount of cash it would bring in by having just made an unauthorised by her kids show production company scantly clad pop song barn set music video and had scheduled a nude photo shoot in Australia.  These things go against Carolines morals, and a photographer is determined to get his nude shots along with the money that would come from them at any cost.

This is a growing as a person type movie, both for the Monkey Girl teen star but more so for the mother.  On the Australian DVD you also get two music videos as extras, both being sung by Lucy Fry as Honey. Pop Down South which is the farmers on top of her in a bikini clip the mother wanted uploaded to the Internet. The other is the theme song to Monkey Girl which basically explains that show more so than the movie did.  Basically the girl was in a plane crash as an infant and is being raised by monkeys.  Somehow she has learnt to sing in English and to follow the human social female norms of shaving her armpits and legs, which is even more weird when you consider female primates are hairy.

If you just wanted something to watch you don't have to think about, you won't go wrong with Now Add Honey.",1461283200,,3505,4.504731861198739
8758387,4,B01EDEKS28,"Honey Halloway (Lucy Fry) is a 16 year old child star poised for adulthood. She is famous as ""Monkey Girl"" and her mom Beth (Portia de Rossi) wants to move on to the next step of fame: sex sells. She is poised to release a sexy video and nude photo shoot.  Her plans are interrupted when she gets popped at the airport and goes to rehab. Honey, who  like Monkey Girl, knows nothing of the real world, moves in with relatives and disrupts the life of everyone she touches.

Honey has a bunch of relatives whose lives she can mess up, so it keeps things going. Unfortunately the film sounds a bit better than it was executed.  Lucy Durack did an excellent job as Katie, reminding me of an Australian Anne Kendrick.  Aimed at a teen girl.

Guide: The film had something that sounded like an F-bomb, but maybe it wasn't.  There is some brief nudity ( Robyn Butler).",1460851200,,861,4.377358490566038
