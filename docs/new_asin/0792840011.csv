148985,3,0792840011,"This is a sequel to the oscar winning film ""In The Heat Of The Night"". 3 years does make a difference. Where Poiter is more subdued in the first movie he's brought more on a personal level in this sequel. It shows Tibbs as a family man, and how he attempts to straddle his personal life from his work. However, when the twain meet and crash into one another this is where you get to see a performance. Tibbs friend played by Martin Landau is a minister with a social conscience, and wants to see the inner city of San Francisco change for the better through social projects, and groups. Unfortunately the minister wasn't able to straddle his private, and work either as a prostitute is found murdered, and he becomes the prime suspect. I found this movie to be somewhat hardcore, and way too blunt. I found Poiter's performance especially with the scenes of where it's Tibbs and his son at odds. Tibbs is attempting I think to be a modern father, or as modern as he could get for that time. However, people today would look at the yelling at his son for watching way too much t.v., introducing his son to smoking cigars, and drinking liquor, and finally the ultimate confrontation where Tibbs slaps his son across the face for not cleaning up his room, and just blanche in horror. These 2 scenes often bothered me as I'm not certain if Tibbs is attempting reverse psychology hoping his son will hate the cigar smoke, and liquor, and about the slapping across the face. Some may find this common, but it's hard to tell when the modern way, and the old-fashioned separate. It leaves me anyway with the sense that I agree that sometimes to get a person to break a habit, or a behavior is to make them do more of the things you hate to see, and hope that it will make them stop because they don't have the control anymore, but at the same time I find slapping of the face to be rather embarrassing. The hands, or behind is one thing, but the face leaves a red mark, and is humiliating. I mean you want to discipline a little more, and not humiliate. It shows you the aftermath of what 1967 was where parents were starting to lose more, and more of thier influence on their children, and this shows an attempt to bridge the gap, and the growing pains that go along with it. I gave it 3 stars as while I found it holding my interest I don't feel I want to see it ever again. Once was enough.",1092441600,5,2385,4.337807606263982
148986,5,0792840011,"Starring Sidney Landau, Martin . McNair, Barbara (Tibbs Wife), ""They Call me Mr. Tibbs is the sequel (sort of ) to `In the Heat of the Night'
I saw this on turnerclassicmovies, and it's one of the most entertaining 70's movies I've seen and you've probably never heard of it.
I can't blame you though, the 70's had a lot of `B' movies that only revolved around drugs, violence and had no plots and bad actors but this movie is one of the best movies made during that era.
The great element of this movie is Poitier himself who resembled the ideal black man- Strong, Intelligent, and Independent. As pointed out in his biography Poitier grew dirt poor in Miami and worked menial jobs, often sleeping in bus terminals. Then he started auditioning in theaters until he eventually got acting parts.
In fact actors like Denzel Washington idolized Poitier growing up, though with all respect to Mr. Washington, he didn't really break down the color barrier as did Sidney. Poitier has broken down color barriers in films like ""In the Heat of The Night"", ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner"", and "" The Defiant Ones (with Tony Curtis)"" He proved that a minority actor can be at the same acting level, if not better than his white counterparts. In fact many of his roles, had him acting against white bigots like ""In the Heat of The Night"" and ""No way out.""
Now on to the opinion.
Sidney Poitier reprises his role as lieutenant Virgil Tibbs from `In The Heat of The Night', this time though, Tibbs is working in San Francisco trying to solve the murder of a prostitute called Miss Joy.
Tibbs approaches the crime scene and like a good detective makes detail of everything that could provide a clue to as to who murdered Miss Joy.
This is a great detective movie, this movie gives you the important aspects of what a good detectives looks for in solving a case.
Fingerprints, pieces of lint on a new carpet, searching for marks on the victim and above all looking into the history of the victim are all clues that Tibbs uses to find the killer.
The suspects are: Reverend Logan Sharpe: Tibbs best friend for the past 18 yrs who is campaigning for a special
proposition for the schools. The role is played here by the legendary Martin Landua who has appeared in over 50 movies or so in his lifetime. While not the charismatic actor, Landua plays his roles perfectly. In touch with the times of the 70's, Landua's role called for a political preacher who cares about the community and wants to give control back to the people. Pay close attention to the speech he gives while supporting his proposition. The words he says are words that most community leaders would use. Also the words he says are bitter sweet too because all the problems he points out are still going in today's school: Better teachers, teachers who care, rights for the less fortunate, etc.
Woody Garfield a real estate man, is the other suspect ,played by the legendary Ed Asner who first became a celebrity through the Mary Tyler Moore Show and other hit tv shows and movies. He plays a real estate man who lends his property to pimps like Mr. Weedon.
Mr. Weedon is a pimp who lives on the same apartment where Miss Joy was killed.
Without revealing too much (since I want you to see this great film the movie keeps you guessing as to who the killer is. Also there are some decent action scenes where Tibbs (resembling Shaft) beats up the white drug dealers who try to interfere with his investigation.
On top of that the film depicts the life of a hardworking black man who protects his family but is tough on them if need be.
For instance, in one gripping scene, Tibbs must discipline his son , Andy Tibbs, for hitting his sister and for not cleaning his room.
Tibbs gives his son a chance to make up for what he has done by giving him the opportunity to clean his room,but he doesn't do it. Tibbs slaps him on the face because he knows that his son, has not learned to respect authority. His son starts crying but still doesn't follow his father's orders. Tibbs slaps him again until he gets the message. A very gritty, tough, great police crime drama movie.
A great inside look into the abilities of Sidney Poitier.",1088467200,16,4173,4.535809018567639
148987,1,0792840011,"Sidney Poitier was wonderful ""In The Heat of the Night"". Yet the sequel, ""They Call Me Mister Tibbs!"", comes across as a disjointed movie at best. With overlapping incomplete story lines it is difficult to feel empathy for any of the characters. The plot is so silly it is like watching a bad re-run of the ""Street of San Francisco"" cop show.
Am I the only one who noticed the major character flaws that don't mesh with who Virgil Tibbs was ""In The Heat Of The Night""?  In that finely acted and well written film Tibbs was a detective from Philly. He was unmarried, without any children. Now three years later he is married, with two half grown kids and has been a S.F. cop for twelve years.  DUH?
Also we have several scenes where Black and White citizens hang out and socialize as if there never was a need for a Civil Rights Movement. And Ed Asner is wasted as a suspect who runs from the police, not because he commited any crime, but for cheating on his wife. The car chase here is maybe the worst in film history.
We see Tibbs, in boring scenes, driving his police car with a carboard partner who never says a word but just chain smokes. In fact all the cops, except Tibbs, are window dressing. While the actual killer's motive for murder doesn't make sense and is totally out of sync with his personality.
Also the famous line of defiance from ""In The Heat Of The Night"", ""They call me Mister Tibbs!"", is never uttered in this film.  Sidney Poiter doesn't show the emotion and conflict that we saw when he was opposite Rod Steiger. In that film Tibbs shined brightly. In the sequel he is just an echo.  This Turkey don't fly and I will stick with the Virgil I knew and loved from ""In The Heat Of The Night"".",1064102400,20,1714,4.346875
148988,4,0792840011,"For 1970, this movie was very interesting, multiple issues for the time were displayed. A look into Virgil Tibbs personal life was an excellent touch, with a troubled son, a beautiful wife (Barbara McNair) and a  demanding job, the performance by all was excellent. The cast included very  talented actors. The plot was interesting, as it was a murder mystery, the  movie included, suspense, romance, and some would say the scene with Virgil  and his son was quite comical.",963619200,9,473,4.949367088607595
148989,1,0792840011,"""In the heat of the night"" was a great film, but all the sequel did was make it look bad. It's a muder mystery with a father and son conflict which we don't care about, and it goes on too long.",960940800,7,193,3.731707317073171

149013,5,0792840011,"I'm the 66th person to review this fine film and the 31st to give it Five Stars (Four And A Half, Really). I just saw this again for only the second time. I'd taped it originally off cable back in the 1990s and have been meaning to buy it on DVD ever since. Now might be the time. This was a great film and it kept me guessing the whole time. I loved the San Francisco setting much more than I would have liked the setting in Philadelphia as it was Tibbs's city was alluded to in the previous film. Sidney Poitier was great as a detective on the hunt for a man who slays a prostitute. All is not as it seems as he leads the investigation. But balancing life as a Father and husband is difficult for him. But he muddles through. Although any son that spoke that way to his Father would have been whacked to this side of kingdom come! See the movie to know what I'm talking about.

This is no In the Heat of the Night, but it certainly held its own. Leonard Maltin gave this film only a Two out of Four Stars rate. That's a bit too low in my opinion. The film had great supporting performances. Barbara McNair, Ed Asner and Anthony Zerbe rounded out a great cast. But it was Martin Landau that really helps make the movie. Unlike in the prequel or the subsequent sequel (The Organization), the antagonist is not an evil person but just a man that made a big mistake. We are able to identify with the individual and that makes the situation very realistic.

I recommend this film and plan to purchase it at the first opportunity.

149014,1,0792840011,"This movie felt like its script was rewritten to be a sequel to In the Heat of the Night. In that far superior film Tibbs is unmarried and from Philadelphia, but here he's married with children and a well-respected veteran of the San Francisco PD. The story is uninspired, the acting wooden, and the whole things feels like a TV movie. Was it written to be a standalone original detective film that was rewritten to be a sequel? Or was it just a badly written cash grab sequel? Either way, the movie sucks, and it only tarnishes the reputation of In the Heat of the Night.",1475452800,,572,4.40566037735849

said like a bad Streets of San Francisco episode but that's not accurate but funny they used the same streets and sets and actors
that that show used so it does actually look like an episode without Malden and Douglas! I saw this in the 70's late night as a kid
and in the 80's but hadn't seen since now I'm watching on THIS TV since I cancelled by cable and got HD antenna and I'm loving
it cause you don't see movies like this on cable anymore which I hate! out of 70 channels I wasn't watching 90% of them and got
bored with the ones I watched! and channels like ESPN and Weather Channel and every channel with it's liberal left wing slant
was enough for me after being laid off! now I'm saving 70 bucks a month and watching more than 30 FREE channels and
great TV shows and movies like this one! This movie is so much better than the crap on cable or new movies or TV today!

149071,2,0792840011,"The only reason I watched this was because it was billed as a sequel to the extraordinary 1967 film ""In The Heat of the Night"".  As a shift worker all through the 90's, I had an addiction to syndicated reruns of the television series from the late 89's of the same name.  It was a great show and I knew it was based on an acclaimed movie, but had never seen it.  This past weekend, I finally saw the original movie, and it was all I expected and more.  It was a riveting story and filled with great performances.  Sidney Poirtier and Rod Steiger especially, but the entire cast was exceptional.  The movie won 5 academy awards, among them Best Picture and Best Actor for Steiger.  After watching it I was so impressed I looked it up to find out more about it and saw there were two sequels.  I immediately went to my Amazon Prime and looked the first one, ""They call me Mister Tibbs"".  Incidentally, the movie title is from a line in one of the very best scenes in the first movie -- you really have to see it.  If nothing else, google the phrase and hopefully you can at least see that scene.  It is on the list of one of my top movie moments of all time.

They call me Mister Tibbs was a SEVERE let down after the first movie.  My biggest complaint is that is it barely a sequel at all.  In my opinion the only thing about it involving the story of the first movie at all is the character of the title character, Police Detective Virgil Tibbs.  There is no reference at all to the first movie.  None.  And I mean AT ALL.  No indication of how long it has been, no indication that the events of the first film had an effect on his life, none of the racial tension...nothing.  The first story was a good mystery but what made it shine was the racial tension that was actually the biggest character.  How everyone dealt with it and how it shaped the characters was the most riveting part of the story, and it was very well done.  None of that is even slightly alluded to or is present in the second story.  It is just a mediocre mystery story with no emotional impact that could have been told from the point of view of any character at all from that era.  This movie did not need to be a Virgil Tibbs story at all, and should not have been.  The intriguing part of the first movie was how Virgil was above the prejudices for the most part, and his humility when he realizes he had his own prejudices and his drive to rise above them.

Maybe two stars is a little rough, but all in all I feel it is deserved.  The story is just...meh.  There is no reason to care that it is Virgil Tibbs and nothing about his situation has the dramatic impact that it had in the first movie.  Sidney Poitier does give another great performance, don't get me wrong.  He is great as Virgil again, it is just as I said that there is no reason to care that the detective involved is Mr. Tibbs.  You cared very much about that in the first movie.  The movie made me feel that I was watching a long episode of a television drama in the 80's or early 90's. There is a very cheesy sub plot involving Tibbs' relationship with his son, but it is not handled too well, as well as the fact that it surges up to the front to annoyingly fade to an anti-climactic resolution in the end without really being dealt with further at all.  I feel had they delved into that storyline stronger, it would have perhaps helped this movie reach closer to the heights soared to by In the Heat of the Night.

I am a big Poitier fan, and will probably go ahead and watch the third movie in the series, although from what I have seen about it I really do not expect it to be much.  If you are a fan of the police drama movies of this era, it may be worth checking out.  It is not necessarily a terrible movie on its own, but as a sequel to the outstanding In The Heat of the Night, it barely holds up to comparison.  Honestly, the only things saving this from a one star bomb rating are the performances by some of the cast.  Sidney Poitier is fantastic, a much younger Ed Anser than I grew up knowing was good and Martin Landau was good, although you are not really inspired to feel much if anything for his character.",1399334400,,4171,4.16875

149127,3,0792840011,"Virgil Tibbs is the name of the cop. He is played by Sidney Poitier. But any connection with ""In the Heat of the Night"" is pretty remote. In that, he was a copy from Philadelphia, PA. Here, he is a cop in San Francisco, and discusses having known Rev. Logan Sharpe (Martin Landau) for something like 15 years. Since he is clearly not 15 years older than he was in his former role, there's been some distortion of the ""reality"" of Virgil Tibbs.

Oh, well, Hollywood is like that.

A prostitute has been murdered. Rev. Sharpe, a liberal minister who was a friend of the deceased, is heading up the ""home rule"" campaign to create local city halls in various sections of town because, as he points out, the neighborhoods have been swallowed up by bigness. There actually was such a proposition in San Francisco, actually raised several times. He was seen leaving her apartment on the day in question, and soon confesses to his friend Tibbs that he had indeed been to see her that day, and had been ""sleeping with her"" for the last few months. This was after attempting to convert her, and loaning her books on Christianity.

But there are many reasons why other suspects must be considered, and Tibbs follows them all up. Ed Asner does a great job of playing a man who had been paying the girl's rent without the knowledge of his wife. There's her landlord, who obviously has lots to hide. Does it include murder? There are some big-time drug dealers, and a variety of other shady characters. But Virgil Tibbs sorts them all out.

No, I'm not going to tell you who dunnit. Follow the evidence just like Lt. Tibbs did. It's not as good as ""In the Heat of the Night,"" but by the standards established for detective stories in San Francisco, it's pretty good.",1336953600,,1752,4.534810126582278
149128,3,0792840011,"Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.

This sequel to In The Heat Of The Night is an okay movie, which for some reason doesn't reference the first movie at all and has Virgil (once again played by Academy Award winner Sidney Poitier) working for a different police department than for the one he said he worked for in the first film. Martin Landau co-stars. The film could have used more character and plot development, particularly in the scenes involving Virgil's domestic life. I felt that it was a little too long, though to be fair, that is a reflection based on that I wasn't too interested in seeing the movie today (though I've been interested in it ever since I read about it years ago). Maybe another viewing will improve my initial opinion. The film will keep you guessing until the final 15-20 minutes. Disregard the R rating, and see it.",1331164800,,859,4.577922077922078
149129,5,0792840011,"In ""In the Heat of the Night"", Sidney Poitier was the victim showing that he could do his job in spite of his ""handicap"" of being black in the South, out of his element. In this movie, he was the leader, broaching no interference in his methods nor taking tidbits of authority from his boss. Sidney's a strong, mature actor in this one.",1323216000,,336,4.349206349206349

1/11: Despite the negative criticisms, They Call Me MISTER Tibbs! is not bad of a film. I just think it needs to be re-titled because the movie has nothing to do with In the Heat of the Night. By doing that would just make things much easier for the audience. Oh yeah, get rid of that fatherly stuff. That's too distracting and unnecessary. Focus on the case and the boiling tension out of the issue. The rating of They Call Me MISTER Tibbs! would have been much better for it. Once again, Sidney Poitier creates a commanding presence in the film and steals the show from start to finish. He is the chief reason why the film is entirely watchable. I like the story, and my interest is sustained well despite a slow start and sluggish pacing at times. Another thing I like about the movie is the mix in of forensic analysis. It was fun to watch. Finally, the part with the son, wow...was that bad or was that bad? I wish that never occurred in the film; I could do without it for sure. All in all, They Call Me MISTER Tibbs! is a good film to watch to pass the time.",1294358400,5,1087,4.225961538461538

Hardly any of them them except Paul Newman, and several others, have that type of quality that Sidney has. Maybe it is called 'paying their dues or practicing their craft'.

7792274,4,0792840011,"Although 47 years old, this 1970 film is still fun to watch. I gave it four instead of five stars because although I enjoyed the film, I felt that the film dragged in some spots where the producers wanted, in my opinion, to show that a black man was human - a view I indorse, but felt it was overdone and had no place in a mystery. It also seemed to me that the film's title, which has nothing to do with the plot, was also chosen for the same purpose. Sidney Poitier is excellent in the film, as are Martin Landau and Edward Asner as two of several suspects. There is suspense in the film because it appears that Landau is the killer of a prostitute, but Poitier wants to investigate the crime because Landau, a very good minister is his friend, and he, Poitier is the best investigator on the police force and if anyone can show Landau is innocent it will be him.  There is also suspense in trying to figure out why the woman was killed.",1502928000,2,939,4.216666666666667
