8620556,4,B00G4DQKDI,I still love this dvd. My second purchase because I ruined the first one.  This play is a combination of several of Tyler Perry's movies. I love the singing and the message and the concept of a couples retreat discussing the age old question of why they got married.,1438732800,,266,4.428571428571429
