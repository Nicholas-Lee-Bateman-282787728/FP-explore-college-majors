8088131,5,B000BKVQSO,Ian Wright is the host for this tour of Tokyo. It is informative and entertaining for the novice or a good memory for someone who has been a frequent visitor.,1421884800,,158,4.3
8088132,4,B000BKVQSO,"Ian Wright is one of my favorite Globe Trekker hosts. He has a quirky type of humor that annoys some people. Nevertheless, this DVD contains a nice overview of Tokyo. He rides the Bullet Train and the Tokyo Metro. I enjoyed the segments with the samurai and the visit to the Tokyo Dome. The part with the robots was funny. I initially enjoyed the visit to Mount Fuji, but that segment was a little too long. I felt that the visit to the fish market was unnecessary. I also felt that the DVD didn't quite cover every major tourist attraction in Tokyo. Still, this DVD is worth purchasing. It's much better than Samantha Brown's visit to Japan.",1349740800,3,642,4.495726495726496
8088133,1,B000BKVQSO,"Video item was described online as a used item.  But I never imagined how used and very worn it looked.  It was not just used and worn, but it even had an old Bronx Library sticker still on it.  Very disappointing appearance, so there was no way I was going to wrap it up as a Xmas gift.

I just handed it to the family that would soon be moving to Tokyo and explained that, if the DVD worked, it was simply for their information before moving there.",1327104000,,450,4.079545454545454
8088134,4,B000BKVQSO,"This Documentary is very good, entertaining and with a lot of informations about the city and the people who are living in it. If like me you think Tokyo is one of the most interesting cities in the world then buy this DVD. The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's only 60 minutes long, should have been a little much longer, but it's not a huge problem, this dvd will be a great addition to your DVD Collection. :)",1309132800,,445,4.126436781609195
8088135,5,B000BKVQSO,"Outstanding video - gives great insight into the culture in Tokyo in a humorous and interesting manner. Globe Trekker's strength is highlighting the most interesting parts of the culture in an entertaining and fun way. My students love this series and beg to see more. The only negative is that the video is starting to get a bit dated (which is obvious as the narrator gets overly excited about GPS and something similar to Google Earth), but still has a good 5 years or so of relevancy. I highly recommend this video.",1304640000,5,519,4.6521739130434785
