She is generous with sharing her knowledge and skills.  This DVD is no exception.  It is an excellent product to get you started with resin in jewelry work.",1325548800,5,288,4.461538461538462
200729,5,1596682493,"I found this instructional DVD very inspiring and it de-mystified much of the questions I had about using resin. I have books on the subject, but being able to see how it is used via DVD really helped me. This DVD does promote ICE resin, which is a brand, but that does not really deter from the general information and projects. I liked Susan Lenert's style. She was not ""performing"" for the camera and I felt as if I was actually inside a classroom with her teaching the craft. She is obviously a very creative and talented artist.",1307664000,7,533,4.448979591836735

7799690,5,1596682493,"I absolutely love this DVD! It is so full of inspiration and ideas.  I love also the whole process.  I didn't expect her to show jewelry pieces from start to finish, that is not what the title implies.  I love how the teacher is very free with her explaining, you can see her thinking process as well as her skills in action!  I am collecting every single one of her videos a little bit at a time.  As a fine artist and metal smith, I can tell that she is a great artist and a passionate teacher.",1434412800,,496,4.072164948453608

7799693,2,1596682493,"I love Susan Lenart Kazmer's work, so was very excited to purchase the DVD and looked forward to watching a good hands-on tutorial.  Big disappointment.  She didn't seem to have a script, or a point.  She stammered her way through, barely completing a thought or a sentence.  It was as if she wandered into her studio and was videotaped on the spur of the moment.  There were no step by step instructions.  I kept waiting for something, anything useful, but that didn't happen.  I didn't ""hate"" it, because I still got to see some of her pieces which are very inspiring. You can watch free videos on youtube that will give you real instructions. I recommend Jen Cushman who really knows how to teach and demonstrate.",1418947200,4,716,4.634920634920635
7799694,5,1596682493,Liked the DVD.  I enjoyed the different projects.,1409961600,,49,5.125
7799695,2,1596682493,"Disappointing DVD.  I was hoping for instruction on projects to make but it was more about her art. She seemed at loss for words at times as if she was not sure of what to talk about next. However I must say she does beautiful work.  But if you have never used resin and are a beginner, I would not recommend this DVD.  I found it pricy for what was presented...more a look around her studio and a talk about her work.",1378080000,7,418,4.073170731707317
7799696,2,1596682493,"Sorry, I couldn't get past hearing all the ""uhms"", ""ers"" and ""sos"" to actually concentrate on what she was saying. If that doesn't bother you, I'm sure it's very informative.",1344124800,3,174,4.833333333333333
