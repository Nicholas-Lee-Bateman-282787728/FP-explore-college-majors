8199545,3,B000R9AKKY,"This is a solid overview chronicling the events during the Columbine shootings.  I bought it to do a project at school with and it will give a good understanding of when things occurred.  There could have been more done involving the kids who were victims and the shooters as well, but overall it is a good video.",1209168000,2,313,4.473684210526316
8199546,3,B000R9AKKY,"This DVD is forty five minutes of the breaking news, a Nightline story, and an interview from Good Morning America the day of and the morning after the Columbine Shootings. While it is interesting to see the ""classic"" newscast, there is little information in the DVD to correct the initial mistakes in the reporting. Therefore, other than providing the blurbs of the newscasts, which are mostly inaccurate as far as what happened, the only thing you are really provided with is the first emotional blow of the shootings. I found it to be good, but I was frustrated that they never took the time to correct the story to the most simple measure, nor do they even take the time to list those who were killed. However they do take the time to talk about the shooters, and talk some about criminal profiling and that was a good way to close.",1207440000,12,836,4.543046357615894
