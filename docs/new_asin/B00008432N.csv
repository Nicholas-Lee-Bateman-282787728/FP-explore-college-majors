1827173,3,B00008432N,"I was a little disappointed with this DVD. The story/movie was great and had clips from ""Piglet's Big Movie"" but some songs were difficult to sing along accordingly. The original Winnie the Pooh song had a different style to it which is nice but you've gotta get used to it, the Tigger song and a couple of others were too fast to read/sing along so words just flash before your eyes. (I guess one advantage is that your child may learn to speed read.) If you or your child has the lyrics memorized then it should not be a problem singing along.",1050192000,6,545,4.352941176470588
1827174,2,B00008432N,"If you've never heard the original Winnie song, then you may be ok with this version.  We had an old version on VHS that was awesome.  Our 1-3 year olds would watch it over and over.

This one is boring and not up to Disney standards in my opinion.

We have 5 more DVDs coming, so I hop they aren't all different than the original VHS.",1361232000,,335,4.03030303030303

1827176,4,B00008432N,It's great! i would recommend this to anyone who wants to teach their kids to sing and have fun! It was a great price as well.,1357603200,,126,3.8846153846153846
1827177,5,B00008432N,Exactly what I was hoping for. My little girl is totally in love with this dvd. She dances everytime she sees it!,1353024000,,113,4.181818181818182
1827178,1,B00008432N,"I am always on the look out for good sing along dvds for my toddler. We have 5 other disney sing along vhs and dvds.  This one is so poorly done, my kids could do better using their computers. Animation from all the winnie the pooh cartoons were used but the characters had different dialog that didn't match the animation. The voices of the characters weren't even close to accurate. My toddler loves winnie the pooh and I expect that is why she will watch this. Anyone older than 2, will have no patience for it.",1338336000,,514,4.354166666666667
1827179,5,B00008432N,This sing along can grow with your child.  Before they can read the screen they will still enjoy the stories and songs adapted from the familiar House at Pooh Corner themes.  Later they can follow the bouncing ball to read the words and learn the songs.  My 2-yo grandson loves it.,1295308800,,281,4.470588235294118
1827180,4,B00008432N,"Great movie for a decent price. The only gripe i would have is the run time. Amazon states this movies is 96 minutes in length, but the dvd itself states 36 minutes. The kids love it, but it is a bit disappointing when they exaggerate the run time by a full hour. Could be a typo, but I basically chose this one because i thought it was a lot longer than the others. Either way it is still a good gift the the kids.",1270684800,,415,3.9523809523809526
1827181,5,B00008432N,"My three year old son LOVES this video!!  It is not just a collection of songs, but it also has a story line of Winnie the Pooh trying to find a song which is his own.  Very entertaining, and cute.  My son asks to watch this over and over again, and now he is singing the songs on his own.  I'm so happy with this video, and highly recommend it for anyone who loves Winnie the Pooh.",1247270400,3,382,3.9220779220779223

The CD was in perfect condition as stated! Fine service!",1220832000,,125,4.7272727272727275
1827183,1,B00008432N,My son did not like the movie.  He is 11 months old.  I did not like the movie either.  It was boring!,1219881600,,102,3.5454545454545454
1827184,1,B00008432N,"If your child is a fan of the current Winnie the Pooh show ""My friends Tigger and Pooh"" then they will probably not like this one. Also if your child likes the more upbeat sing alongs this one won't compare.",1219449600,2,207,4.2
1827185,5,B00008432N,"My 18 month old can't get enough of this DVD.  The songs have catchy tunes that she loves and the story is super cute.  The theme is based around Pooh Bear's search for ""his"" song.  All his friends have their own song to share and also work together to help Pooh find his song.  If your child likes Winnie the Pooh (and friends) and music then I would definitely get this.",1192838400,2,372,4.197183098591549
1827186,1,B00008432N,"I have to say I love every Disney movie we have ever gotten, until I purchased Disney sing along with pooh bear and piglet too.  I have a 3 year old and she loves the sing along movies.  After watching this movie my daugter will not get in the bathtub without shaking and will not allow us to put anything in the bathtub with her.  We discovered that her fear came from the movie where there is a part where rabbit and tigger are taking a bath and tigger pulls the plug and rabbit goes down the drain.  My gaughters bathtime used to be her most relaxing time of the day.  She would take all of her toys in with her, but not anymore. It has become the most stressfull time of the day for her.  It is very sad to see her so scared and I just wanted to share this with all who could benefit.",1178496000,6,788,3.9872611464968153
1827187,5,B00008432N,"My 2-year old just started loving Winnie the Pooh, and Piglet's Big Movie is her favorite of all.  This DVD includes all of the wonderful songs from Piglet's Big Movie, as well as some of the classics and new songs just on this DVD.  It is worth it to be able to cue up a particular song that your child loves so they can sing along.  The story follows Pooh as he tries to find his very own song.",1168992000,2,396,3.9873417721518987
1827188,5,B00008432N,"Winnie the Pooh, music and a two year old, a delightful combination.  I got this for my grandaughter for Christmas and she was delighted with it.",1168646400,,145,4.576923076923077
1827189,4,B00008432N,"I purchased this video for my 2 1/2 year old daughter.  At first, she did not seem interested in the sing-along format.  Within days, however, my daughter was sing all the songs.  Most of the time, she even gets the words right.  My neice (now 16) also loved the Disney sing along videos when she was young.

While the videos promote reading and singing, they do an even better job of promoting the Disney brand.  I really wish Disney would make it easier to skip over the promos and get right to the content on the DVDs.",1168300800,2,521,4.319587628865979
1827190,5,B00008432N,"""Sing a Song With Pooh Bear and Piglet Too"" is a wonderful DVD featuring Pooh songs from all the back towards the beginning up to the still somewhat recent ""Piglet's Big Movie."" You get classic songs such as ""Harvest What You Grow"" and ""Heffalumps and Woozles"" as well as newer songs like ""Sing Ho For the Life of A Bear (Expotition March)"" and ""With a Few Good Friends."" These later songs, as well as some others are performed in part or whole by Carly Simon.

This isn't just some cobbled together sing-along thing. They actually went to the trouble of putting together a real story. Pooh is on a search for his song --- a special song to call his own. He searches all over the Hundred Acre Wood and discovers some of his friends' own special songs. Eventually, he ends up finding ""My Song"" --- a wonderful number and a great new song.

One odd thing about this here is that repeated lyrics don't show up on-screen, at least not in the normal sing-along font. Fortunatley, close-captioning and/or subtitles are available to fill in.

Overall, I think this is really great. Not only did they manage to pull up some really classic stuff that I'd never heard before, the more recent songs are great as well. A wonderful compilation of classic and new animation and voice talent. Piglet is featured here --- John Fiedler --- may he rest in peace.

This DVD also has some neat special features. The most interesting one is sing-along versions of all the songs except the Carly Simon ones in Spanish and, oddly enough, Italian. I say oddly because Italian isn't an option you would normally see. But it's quite nice to hear. The ""Winnie the Pooh"" theme song is also included with these, even though the English version on this DVD is a Carly Simon version. The Spanish and Italian version is in the classic style.

The ""Word Time"" vocabulary activity is so clever! The idea of it is that the viewer is given a word by the narrator and then they select the object on screen that matches it. But the real fun is in selecting items that don't match --- there's some extremely witty and fun commentary from the characters if you do this.

There's also a musical note activity in which short tunes are played on a xylophone and then the player tries to play it back. I don't think this one is too good --- it plays too quickly and you only get two chances --- worse, it's confusing because you end up forgetting where it was you messed up.

As for the quality --- I don't see any decline here. The quality is the same as ever, it's just different. Things change, things grow and Pooh is certainly bigger than ever. Sing ho for this DVD!

Great for kids (though not those who are too young to really understand or follow it yet) or any Pooh fan.",1137801600,30,2735,4.466933867735471
1827191,4,B00008432N,"It's a cute video, but unlike many other Sing Along Songs versions, only scenes from Winnie the Pooh are included. I find this can start to bore my kids, since the others are usually a smorgasbord of songs from all sorts of the Disney classics.

One of the best Sing Alongs by far is the Under the Sea version. Great clips are included from movies as far back as Peter Pan and up to about the Little Mermaid time. That's a great video.",1130112000,5,435,4.240963855421687
1827192,2,B00008432N,"Note for Disney Sing Along Songs fans- This DVD only features songs from the Winnie the Pooh films, videos and television series. It doesn't feature songs from any other Disney classics. But anyway...

I love Winnie The Pooh. I even bought a shorter version of this on video- it was simply called Sing A Song With Pooh Bear. Now they've added And Piglet Too to the title, as well as songs from Piglet's Big Movie. Piglet's Big Movie was my least favorite of all the Pooh movies so I didn't expect much from this Sing Along Songs DVD- I wasn't disappointed. If only they had songs from Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search For Christopher Robin. Still, this is fun for really young kids and as an added bonus it teaches you how to draw Winnie The Pooh.",1123718400,6,749,4.467153284671533

However, the DVD plays on my laptop which is just as good as I've been looking for this DVD for a long time. I have the VCR version from my childhood and it doesn't play anymore.

It's one of our favorites at night because it's more relaxing than the energy charged Disneyland Fun. It still has some up tempo songs, but they don't have my kids wanting to dance at 9 PM. Instead, they like to cuddle up and watch it at the end of their busy day! It's a really adorable collection of songs.",1495929600,,456,4.0777777777777775
