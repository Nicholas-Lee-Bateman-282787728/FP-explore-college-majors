2441913,2,B000BUA4PA,"this DVD is a recap of a series - when they could have put together the entire series and charged 29.99 per and made more $ and made customers happier. But most notable is that the very deserving winner, J.D. Fortune, who's rock star looks and style as well as his perfect vocals, had actually developed in front of the camera during this series. From his interpretation of California Dreaming, to his leaving his team to write the #1 single Pretty Vegas (#1 in Canada) by himself...the series is a chronicle of the making of one of music's newest stars, and Burnett and his series can take the credit. But he should share this with the many fans that will want to see it for themelves.",1130198400,8,686,4.4523809523809526
2441914,1,B000BUA4PA,I was looking forward to the complete series also. To say this is a disappointment is an understatement! I would have gladly paid at least $50 to see the whole thing plus commentary and special features! I was looking forward the the reality segments the most. I hope the producers take note of the reviews here and consider putting out a comprehensive collection.,1130198400,16,364,4.7936507936507935
2441915,1,B000BUA4PA,"I would have gladly paid a high amount of money for the complete (unabridged) set of RockStar shows - which means the reality segments would have needed to be included as well.  But this 'blah' offering by Burnett and INXS?  No, thanks... I'll gladly skip this video travesty!  Such an incredibly demeaning attitude and 'slap in the face' to all of the original rockers - most especially the brilliantly talented MIG AYESA... who was truly the overwhelming fan favorite and certainly was the most versatile, skillful and dynamic of all the RockStar contestants!!  Save your money for something worthwhile - I know I'll be saving mine...",1130198400,7,636,4.971698113207547
2441916,1,B000BUA4PA,"...and the almighty dollar.  Don't give the people what they want, but slap together a half-assed DVD of the RockStar series just in time for Christmas.  Ah yea, Christmas gift idea to line MB's pockets. Hm.  Don't think I'll take them up on this offer.",1130198400,9,253,4.5777777777777775
2441917,1,B000BUA4PA,"I cannot express how disappointed I am that they have chosen not to include the whole season with all shows including the VH1 segments and all interviews.  I missed the first episodes and did so want to see all of them.  And then to have only 2 performances by the most magnificent talent of the whole series-Mig Ayesa-is pure idiocy!  I was already saving my money, anticipating the DVD set to be pricey, but was willing to spend almost any amount on the complete set. Now I will not be purchasing it at any price",1130198400,9,514,4.389473684210526

2441929,4,B000BUA4PA,Its got all the great performaces. Jordis Unga and Marty Casey rocked that show. Would be better if it was the whole show and not just highlights of it.,1355702400,,152,4.275862068965517
2441930,3,B000BUA4PA,"OK, so I feel a bit screwed. I thought by waiting SIX YEARS, they would have come out with a dvd package of all the episodes from the series. Even with the first INXS concert with JD, their audition tapes and a few moments of behind the scene stuff that either was or wasn't included in the first airings of the episodes were a bit butchered. For example, JD's birthday party. All they showed was what wasn't aired. They also included only 17 of the 149 songs were done on the show. Total ripoff there, and most of the extras that were aired at the beginning of the show and between the songs wasn't there as well. I would have gladly paid for all the episodes in their entirety with all the behind the scenes and extras.

For what it's worth, the dvd in of itself is great, but not as great as it could have been. So, now, the production company needs to get off their asses and get it together. It's been 6 years. Besides, it's not like it wouldn't sell.",1326067200,2,956,4.224043715846994
2441931,4,B000BUA4PA,"I picked up this DVD on a whim -- it was cheaply priced.  My wife and I are fans of INXS and watched the entire series when it aired.

The DVD reminded me how much I enjoyed the show's performance portion.  I don't miss the whole shows at all, but I would have preferred that this DVD included all the performances, not just a sample -- even Dana and Daphna's.

That Ty's early-season rendition of Heartbreaker is absent is a minor crime, and I would have liked to have seen some of the ""sing for your life"" performances.

The extras are not anything special, except for the five song set from the new INXS after JD was named the winner.

Not bad for the money if you liked or never watched the show.",1243555200,,700,4.225563909774436
2441932,4,B000BUA4PA,"While not a comprehensive collection of the peformances on the show this collection does a nice job of showcasing most of the memorable performances from the season.  A few performances are missing - most notably - Mig's version of ""Baby I Love Your Way"", and any performance of INXS songs during the course of the season.  Nonetheless, it is a good snapshot of the show at a reasonable price.",1222214400,,393,4.681159420289855
2441933,4,B000BUA4PA,THis product was not quite what I expected it to be. I thought they would have all the performances. There are people who are not even on here. The performances that are on here are good and it was still a good buy but it was not what I was expecting so I was a little disappointed.,1204156800,,282,3.9649122807017543

2441936,4,B000BUA4PA,"If you are an INXS Fan you have to buy it, but It's not what I was expecting in the DVD, I thought I would be able to see more of the program not just a few songs from just a few singers. I wanted interviews with the members of INXS, there are non, and the most important part when they picked JD is not in the DVD. But you can see a concert, their first concert with JD. Kinda fun a few mistakes of JD's first presentation.

Some jokes and JD naked shhhhhhhhhh, yes naked ladies LOL.

Enjoy",1173571200,,491,3.9494949494949494
2441937,5,B000BUA4PA,"Loved this CD!!!  It's my second favorite of all the ""Rockstar"" CD's  Marty Casey and the Lovehammers is still the BEST!!!!!",1168300800,,124,4.857142857142857
2441938,5,B000BUA4PA,The best of the best battle it out with the Amazing 'JD Fortune' winning the gig.,1168214400,,81,4.125
2442019,3,B000BUA4PA,"When I first heard that the band Inxs was going to go the route of ""reality show"" to decide a new lead singer, I admit I was pretty disappointed.  However, since Inxs is one of my favorite bands, I could not help put tune into the series ""Rockstar: Inxs"".  As the days and weeks went on, I slowly but surely got into the show.  Much of the reason for my increasing interest was as contestants were being eliminated, the quality of the contestants - and their performances was improving.  By the time the final three were reached - Mig Ayesa, Marty Casey, and JD Fortune - I was convinced Inxs had picked the best three contestants.  While I did think Casey was the better overall musician - and best contestant in the competition, I did feel Inxs picked the singer with the best fit to be their lead singer - JD Fortune.  When I heard, ""Rockstar: Inxs - The DVD"" was being released, I was hoping that it would capture the essence of the show.  While this DVD does have good performances (including the first concert with JD and Inxs immediately following the finale) and some good behind the scenes information, I do feel it fell short to capturing that essence of the show.

The series ""Rockstar: Inxs"" followed a three day cycle.  On the first day, we got behind the scenes information on what was going on in ""the mansion"" (where the contestants lived during the competition).  The second day was when the contestants would perform songs (sometimes covers, sometimes original tunes).  The third day was the ""elimination"" day in which the bottom three contestants (in voting from the second day) would have to perform an Inxs song.  Inxs would then decide which person would then be eliminated from the competition.  The DVD focuses mostly on performances from the second day and some behind the scenes stuff (some from the first day, some unseen).  While the DVD does a good job at capturing the ""best performances"", it lacks in many other areas.  Here are ten points on this:

1. There are no performances of the contestants performing the Inxs songs.  You miss the opportunity to hear Marty Casey do ""Don't Change"" and JD Fortune do ""This Time"".  These were epic performances.  I would have also liked to have seen the finale in its entirety.  The only original song shown is Fortune's ""Pretty Vegas"" - and that is shown during the ""first concert"".

2. There is little interaction with Inxs shown on this DVD.  Some of the best moments of the show were when Inxs provided critique and praise to the contestants - as well ""coaching"" the clinics. In addition,  Dave Navarro (""the host"") is virtually absent from this DVD - except for some clips, but even those lack spoken words by Navarro.  On the positive end, we do get the ""jamming"" by Inxs and Navarro while the contestants perform.

3. While the DVD does provide an intro clip to each song, the problem is that the DVD doesn't do a good job at telling the story of the competition.  As a result, the intro clips are meaningless unless you saw the show in its entirety.

4. The performances are good.  They focus on the six finalists - Fortune, Casey, and Ayesa - as well as Jordis Unga, Suzie McNeil, and Ty Taylor.  Many great songs are missing like Fortune's ""Suspicious Minds"" and Casey's ""Lithium"".  The other 9 finalists were very weak and its good they weren't included on the DVD.  One thing worth noting is that for the show's purpose many of the songs had the lyrics edited.  This was so they could fit on TV - you can't blame the DVD for that.

5. The performances are often as good as the ""House Band"".  In some cases I felt the ""House Band"" was phenomenal and in other cases I thought they just didn't show up.  In most cases, the ""House Band"" was better than not.

6. I like how some of the performances are re-arranged by the contestants and how others were not.  Casey was brilliant re-arranging Britney Spears' ""Baby One More Time"" into a dark number.  At the same time Ayesa was brilliant keeping to the spirit of Seal's ""Kiss From a Rose"".

7. During the ""first concert"" that followed the show, Fortune gives an emotional performance of ""Never Tear Us Apart"".  As a tribute to his competitors, they participate in some of the vocals of that song.  That was one of the highlights.

8. You can see and hear that during the ""first concert"" that ""Pretty Vegas"" was still a work in progress.  I think it is admirable that they did ""Pretty Vegas"", but there was still some re-arranging and tweaking of the song that would follow.  It was much more polished when released on the ""Switch"" album - and even better when I saw it live in concert during the tour.  I did like how we saw that it was a work in progress.

9. On the downside, you can see that during the ""first concert"", Fortune needed to mesh with the band more - and I guess that was to be expected.  ""Don't Change"" the band's traditional finale just didn't live up to standards I would expect.  The good news is when Inxs went on tour, this song would be as flawless as ever.  Again, there is an element of realism by showing this on the DVD.

10. The behind the scenes clips and extras are excellent.  I wish they would had shown the whole radio segment that was filmed.

Overall good performances and good behind the scenes information.  However what this DVD really lacks is the story of the competition.  I'm hopeful that someday all of the episodes of the show will be released in a boxed set.  For now, this will do.  Inxs fans and fans of the show may want this for their collection, but I'd stop short of calling this a ""must have"".",1167868800,4,5572,4.50049850448654

2442021,5,B000BUA4PA,"My Wife and I followed this show and loved many of the performances...

Now with this DVD we get to re-live some of those moments and we found ourselves playing Jordis's Man who sold the world over and over again...and jumping up and down along with Suzie in her rendition of Bohemian rhapsody... if you loved the show this is a MUST DVD... if you didn't get to watch the show then YOu MuST buy this to get a good look at some top notch singers laying it all on the line.

Only regret is that Mig's version of Peter Frampton's Baby I love your Ways was not included....  Overall A GREAT BUY!!!",1167782400,,593,4.230088495575221

Unfortunately, the DVD only contains 17 select performances - plus behind the scenes and additional JD/Inxs performances.  Although those chosen for the DVD were great, I was looking forward to viewing the whole concert series in its entirity - including performers who were not in the ""bottom 5"".  The DVD is enjoyable - but I was disappointed with the amount of footage.",1162857600,,594,4.97979797979798

Deanna Johnston deserves to be featured.

Well put together though.",1162684800,,145,5.0
2442024,4,B000BUA4PA,"Surprised to find the best performances from the TV show were not taken from the TV show, but a later concert.  More polished, with the addition of chorus, brass, and strings - but not as fresh and perhaps lacking in the excitement and surprise on the performers faces when they realize they have hit it just right.  Would love to see the broadcast versions for comparison.  Still really like the behind the scenes stuff.",1155254400,,421,4.662162162162162
2442025,5,B000BUA4PA,This video has some great behind the scenes looks at the show and the performers. It also has great perfromances from the show and has some great intros. Definitely a must for any INXS fan.,1152835200,,189,4.428571428571429

And now that the new season begun, I'm already looking foward to buy the DVD ""Rockstar: Supernova""! :)",1152144000,4,341,4.762711864406779
2442027,4,B000BUA4PA,"I didn't see much of the actual show when it was aired, but caught a few performances here and there, and I watched the finale where JD was chosen over Marty.  Then we acquired Marty's disc (with Trees among many other good songs) and SWITCH, and I wanted to hear more.  This DVD was a decent overview of the show, it seems to me, with some very good performances.  My personal favorite is Marty doing Mr. Brightside solo, though there are others I enjoyed as well.  I also enjoyed some of the vignettes from the behind the scenes material, and the five song INXS performance with JD was solid.  (As an editorial aside, I think JD was the right man for the job, though I wonder if he'll be serious enough or meticulous enough to perform INXS songs the way they will want to do them - by now they've toured and reviews are probably in on his live performances...Marty was my favorite of the contestants though I'm probably biased since I'm from the Chicago area...)

All in all, a good DVD with some really great moments captured.",1146614400,6,1029,4.446808510638298

But all in all,I enjoy the DVD.Obviously I am a JD fan,lol..But I enjoyed a few other rockers as well. Jordis singing Imagine was really moving,Suzie singing Bohemian Rhapsody was so entertaining. Also liked her version of Losing My Religion. Marty doing Baby One More Time was interesting. Was kind of cool to see a different spin put on the pop song. Also really enjoyed Never Tear Us Apart.

Not sure how the performances were selected but I would have liked to have seen JD's Hand in my Pocket, Cold as Ice and the Come As you Are/Pretty Vegas set. In my opinion, the CAYA/PV set was the BEST performance of the entire season. However since the INXS concert portion includes Pretty Vegas I can understand why it was excluded.

Missing the absolutely brilliant ""Pretty Vegas"" with Dave Navarro and the house band among others yet still JD's version of ""Money"" is absolutely smoking. He owns the stage on this one not only does he nail the vocal but his performance was worthy of many a classic rocker frontman.

Not all of the songs that I enjoyed the most are on this DVD,but there is a good sampling. The mini-concert was also surprisingly good it begs the question as to how JD could perform this well under this sort of pressure he sounds like he has been in the band INXS for years.

A good look into the future of INXS.The next question can INXS keep it going?Fortune is a rocker,INXS is a dance band how well can these two entities mesh and does INXS know how to put them together?Switch was too rushed to be representative of this fusion.

I enjoyed the series, I enjoyed this DVD - it's so worth ten dollars - and I can't wait for Marty Casey's new CD which is due out very shortly.

Since the pick was made it was very enjoyable to view this dvd and see how good these ""rock stars"" were in their own right.  The mini concert was totally awesome.  It alone is worth the price of the dvd. The ""Too Hot for TV"" portion is exactly what it says and while very entertaining to those of us that are of an adult age, I agree with other posters and suggest that younger viewers be monitored and perhaps this portion shouldn't be included in their viewing.

Buuuuuttt, we are also treated to the INXS mini-concert that took place after JD Fortune was chosen as their new singer...easily worth far more than $10, in my eyes.  Was this released because MB just wants to make more money off of this show and its fans?  Heck, yes...he's a mogul...that's what he does, but, since he never promised me any more than that, I can live with it.

2442125,5,B000BUA4PA,"The dvd is not a total compilation of the series and shows, but it does have what I consider the best performers duriong their best performances. There is a mini concert that was not on the tv show which I liked (would have paid for that alone). There is some extra footage from the show including a feew ""TOO HOT FOR TV"" clips.  (The ass cake included)  I would definitely pay more for a total season DVD, but for 10 bucks there is about 2.5 hours of fun, and I  loved it!  Thanks INXS",1133654400,,486,4.138297872340425
2442126,4,B000BUA4PA,"you get plenty.  Yes, I would have preferred the entire season of RS:INXS on DVD with plenty of extras.  Buuutt...for $10 this is a great buy.  It was worth the $10 just to see the ""mini"" concert by INXS!  (AWESOME!!!!)

Personally, I enjoyed each of the stage performances better this time around (without thinking about the competition).  I also enjoyed each of the bonus features, but did find the photo slideshow a bit lacking.  My favorite extras were the casting interviews and the Too Hot for TV.  (Word of caution to those with children- If your child enjoyed RS:INXS and wants to see this DVD, please screen it first.  Some scenes and language are not suitable for children.)

Overall, if you enjoyed the RS:INXS series, you will enjoy this DVD.  Even though you'd prefer it all, ten bucks is a bargain for this material.",1133395200,4,830,4.694444444444445
2442127,4,B000BUA4PA,I was surprised that I liked this DVD.  I really wanted the entire Rock Star Series on DVD and first thought I would be disappointed by this.  I was wrong.  The mini concert that was given after the Finale is excellent.  All the clops with JD Fortune are fantasstic.  This DVD is well worth the money.  But I still want the full season on DVD.

2442149,5,B000BUA4PA,"FINALLY! The most eagerly anticipated DVD release of 2005 is nigh. The classic story of how Kelly Clarkson became the new drummer for the White Stripes is a lesson for us all in blood, sweat and tears. What critics have hailed as ""Must see TV! The taste of the American public has finally risen to the level of the quality of what is produced for network television-hooray!"" Some of my personal fave moments on this stunning DVD: Kelly's duet with judge Mickey Donlenz, who (as we all remember on episode 6) unexpectedly jumps onstage with her to join in on a rollicking version of ""Cold Turkey"", backed by the 'Stripes themselves; and of course the unforgettable naked food fight back at the mansion between Kelly and fellow aspirants Tom Green, Anderson Cooper and Julia Butterfly-wacky! You know, this inspiring video makes me drop to my knees every day and thank the maker that becoming a famous musician no longer requires raw talent, creative inspiration and musical chops-I mean, its so much EASIER just to be seen on TV and get voted in by 15 year old teenage girls with eating disorders! For instance, think about how much more awesome the Beatles could have been if only Paula Abdul had been there and possessed the power to choose who the final members would be! (I betcha SHE wouldn't have kicked Pete and Stu out!)This DVD belongs on your shelf next to ""Battleship Potempkin"", ""The Wonderful, Horrible Life Of Reni Reifenstahl"", and ""Gigli"" Essential viewing, especially for those who do not understand irony or are refreshingly unburdened by an IQ.",1133222400,4,1562,4.832089552238806

2442151,1,B000BUA4PA,"What the &%@$ with this 'highlight' DVD - HOW DARE THEY NOT RELEASE THE ENTIRE SEASON!!!!  And who the heck thinks that THOSE GUYS could possibly decide what to include in the 'highlights'?!?  I don't want just 'highlights' - I want the whole enchilada dammit!!!

Shame on me for not keeping every single eppy on my TiVO - I shoulda KNOWN this would happen!  When I read that there would be a DVD, I ASS-U-ME(d) that the DVD would have ALL the episodes!  Who releases a TV show DVD that doesn't include ALL THE SHOWS?!?!?  This is absolutely ridiculous!  Burnett's ""The Apprentice"" DVDs have all the shows - why on earth won't THIS one????

I'll give my $50+ to someone on eBay if this is the kind of dribble the 'legit' DVD is going to be. INXS, Burnett, powers-that-be... YOU BLEW IT ON THIS ONE!!!!

Me vewy vewy ticked!!!!",1132876800,,826,4.489932885906041
2442152,1,B000BUA4PA,"I see in earlier reviews the complaints that CBS did not put the entire series on DVD. Don't worry, they will. After they milk as many people as the can out of ten bucks for a highlight disc. I have no doubt the full season will arrive after CBS/Burnett get a much as they can out of this ""teaser"" DVD.",1132099200,5,302,4.05
2442153,3,B000BUA4PA,"Although fans' hopes aren't completely crushed since this DVD is a great mini-concert-retrospective of some of the show's best moments, including performances by INXS as well as the rockers, and key moments such as their arrival and the partying, my expectation was for this to be a collection of all the episodes in the series.

It's a nice montage of memories but one hopes that sometime the whole series, in its entirety, will be released.  After all, the past and future of INXS came together on this show as well as a possible launching pad for some great solo careers. Three stars for the music since you do pay more for an album than ten bucks, but I was disappointed.",1131408000,44,675,4.616666666666666
2442154,1,B000BUA4PA,"I can't believe MB and CBS decided to release a ""condensed"" version of the show on DVD.  I was so excited when I found out a DVD of the show was scheduled to be released in the near future.  I naturally assumed it would be the complete season and so I deleted the shows saved on TIVO.  BIG MISTAKE!!!! I had no choice but to buy the complete season on EBAY for $49.99.  Too bad CBS and MB will not see a penny of my money.",1130976000,9,422,3.872093023255814
2442155,2,B000BUA4PA,"OH I am soooooo kicking myself for not recording every single episode now. Didn't think I would have to because I thought FOR SURE they would release the whole season on DVD. And yes, I am COMPLETELY disappointed.

Not only the show itself and seeing how the other rockers changed and grew, but also the story of JD IS a ONE OF A KIND history... it's not like a season of CSI which you will wind up seeing in re-runs 448 times. If they were smart they would realize why THAT makes this series A MUST HAVE for your dvd collection.

And if they saw what these things are going for on Ebay... People out there are paying upwards of $300 for this. Which, I suppose, makes the ppl with the fore-thought to record all three shows every week and save them the smartest ones of all.

I guess all I can do is pray that they release it all at a later date or that I win some money so I can afford to pay the $300+ for one on Ebay LOL ;p

Still, for $10 I will buy this one just to have *something* to watch. *sigh*.... utterly disappointed.",1130630400,8,1030,4.109452736318408
2442156,5,B000BUA4PA,"So, do I write a review for what this DVD SHOULD have been...or do I review it for what it IS?  Yeah, I'm pissed at CBS and Mark Burnett for totally short-shrifting the fans of this show.  People didn't watch Rock Star just for the music, we watched it for a behind-the-scenes look at how songs, music and *musicians* get made.  This DVD offers NONE of that, and that's a travesty -- SHAME on you CBS!!!!!

However...as a DVD, taken for what it is, the offerings aren't bad for the money -- twenty-some GREAT songs, out-takes, and footage from the un-aired mini-concert with the brand new INXS, all for ten bucks?  When CDs these days have 10 songs, eight of which suck, and cost $15? No, this is a pretty good deal.

Here's what's supposedly on the DVD:  Bonus features include casting interviews, a backstage tour of the show and a VIP party at the ""Rock Star"" mansion. Clips include Jordis talking about dedicating ""The Man Who Sold the World"", the rockers arriving at the mansion for the first time, etc. Also included is a ""Too Hot For TV"" segment, which includes, among other things, Fortune's birthday celebration.  (Woohoo!)

""Suicide Blonde"" - INXS (from mini concert after the finale)

And who knows, maybe we'll get the whole show in the future -- it must take a while to get the music rights to all those songs.  So for now, this will tide me over...but I'm a-warnin' you CBS, this better not be all we get!",1130371200,180,2135,4.533854166666667

The entire season is what makes the show, and subsequently, the live performances, so interesting. Yes, the live performances are great - which you can see SOME of them. But the story behind how the performances came to be, and then the OTHER performances - the ones where the performers do an INXS song - are also worth seeing; as well as the final contestants own song. These are not on the DVD.

There is NO DVD of the entire show. I don't know why the show didn't think they could make a dollar or two off putting the show onto a DVD with high quality video, vs. having me find excerpts on youtube to watch.",1422230400,2,883,4.281437125748503
