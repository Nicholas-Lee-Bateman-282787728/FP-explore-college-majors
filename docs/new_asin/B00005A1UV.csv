7934833,5,B00005A1UV,"Excellent Tai Chi tape for those just learning Tai Chi, or for those who want to increase their flexibility in an enjoyable and meditative way.",1313539200,,143,4.76
7934834,1,B00005A1UV,"I was forced to give a rating of one star, since there is no place to indicate that no stars are warranted.  The copy of Gentle Tai Chi Meditation in Motion that I received was defective.  It stopped mid-exercise and rewound.  Repeated attempts to advance the tape or fast forward were unsuccessful.  Needless to say, i'm not a satisfied customer.",1237939200,,347,4.733333333333333
7934835,5,B00005A1UV,"This is my first dvd showing Tai Chi, I have books that I am now starting to read, but this dvd makes me want to have more dvd's. This is an excellant dvd as far as I'm concerned, clear concise, not rushed, and easy to follow and do, and quite enjoyable. It is around 45 minutes long and it won't leave you tired or sore. I picked this style(gentle)as I am an older person as is my wife. I wanted her to be able to do it also, sitting down as well as I doing the exercises standing up. To me (60) some of these exercises are quite simple, but to my wife, who has quite a few problems this may be what she needs for sitting down exercise. This is one of the beauties of this dvd,it can be done sitting or standing,although if you are going to do it standing you'll need a little room as there is a bit of movement to your whole body after you get into the swing of things.all in all, I'm very pleased with this  and the instructor is very good and easy to follow. I highly recommend this if you are just starting out as I, and you don't want to exhaust yourself, try it, it's fun and somewhat exhilerating! I also think it may be a bit better than a book,as the actual doing and watching with the instructors seems to make it all easier to understand and follow.",1207958400,,1261,4.06425702811245
7934836,5,B00005A1UV,"As the fitness director for a group of retirement communities, I've based a whole class series on this video.  In the last year many of our residents have seen tremendous improvement in strength, balance and endurance.  I recently increased the length of the class to keep them challenged.  The instructions are clear, concise and easy to follow, and the forms flow from one to the next seamlessly.  The moves can be modified by people of any fitness level, standing or seated.  I have participants who can do this standing but will take a chair occasionally to strengthen and stretch the abdominals and lower back.  I wish there was a second video with slightly more challenging forms for progression.  It's wonderful!",1206057600,,719,4.941666666666666
7934837,5,B00005A1UV,"For a beginner in Tai Chi, this was exceptionally good beause the instructions, examples and terminology were easy to understand and follow.  The setting for the ""class"" was appropriate and the music was soothing.  The two assistants (or students, I don't know which) were a man who was not especially graceful and an older woman.  This showed the viewer that one does not have to be a dancer to perform Tai Chi.",1129680000,12,412,4.694444444444445
7934838,2,B00005A1UV,I found this video hard to follow. I was looking for something easier. Instruction is confusing.,1099526400,,96,5.0625
7934839,5,B00005A1UV,"I have severe spine and hip problems, and Tai Chi was recommended by my physician.  After some research, I decided this sounded like the best introduction -- especially considering my physical limitations.  It is perfect in every way, with gentle routines, easy to understand and I'm already feeling the benefits in my flexibility, endurance, balance.  It also provides a general all-around good feeling.
It's particularly nice that there are two routines offered on the tape, one for standing and one for sitting.  Due to my physical problems with my hip, I can't stand but all the benefits are coming to me with just the sitting down routine.  There isn't anything on the tape I can't do sitting down.
My husband is also doing the routines -- he does the standing ones while I do the sitting ones.  He has a problem with neck pain and limitation of movement in that area and has seen chiropractors for this for some time.  The chiropractic has helped some, but this tape has provided so much more flexibility and help with his pain that he now is only doing the Tai Chi.
My husband was quite sceptical of Tai Chi and reluctant to try it, but he's amazed and now it's a part of our daily routine and nice to share together.
I highly recommend this tape for anyone who is either a beginner or who has any type of physical limitations.  We plan to move on to more advanced techniques at some point; but, without this tape as a foundation, we probably would never have realized how beneficial Tai Chi could be for us.",1083715200,28,1515,4.564575645756458
