8240547,5,B00114XLOG,"Foremost, these have been recorded in HD digital, so the resolution is astounding compared to older ones recorded with analog cameras.  It has alot of fly overs that feels like a ride.  It does have a few still views of cities and such, but it is probably the best one I have seen about Washington with Alaska DVD as a bonus.",1167782400,3,325,4.311475409836065
