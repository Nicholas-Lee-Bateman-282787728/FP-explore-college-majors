2440993,5,B000BT98XU,"""What's New Scooby-Doo, Volume 8: Zoinks! Camera! Action!"" contains the best, greatest, funniest, and most mysterious episodes of the entire television series. Good thing that there'll all together on this DVD. The following are the episodes featured on this DVD, and a short description of them. The episode's monster are written in CAPITAL LETTERS within the episode description.

1.  Lights! Camera! Mayhem! -- THE FACELESS PHAMTOM is trying to sabotage a movie in Hollywood.
2.  E-Scream -- VIRTUAL REALITY CREATURES are coming to life at a video game convention.
3.  Simple Plan and the Invisible Madman -- An INVISIBLE MADMAN is trying ot ruin Simple Plan's concert.
4.  A Scooby-Doo Valentine -- The gang are blamed for a crime that their CLONES commited!

Overall, these are great episodes.....better than the original Scooby-Doo television series. I think that all the episodes deserve an A+++++.  If you're new to the ""What's New Scooby-Doo"" series (or ANY Scooby-Doo series), buy this volume. You will not regret at all, because the mysteries are not obvious. These four fantastic episodes are family fun for everyone. (Plus, the Special Features are fun). Buy it!!! It's a good thing you can put in English, Spanish, or French - that anyone can enjoy this! ^_^",1150588800,5,1272,5.115942028985507
