When the Europeans are painted as evil and nasty, remember that the natives were worse.
Oh, the movie is great and very entertaining.",1377043200,,393,4.880597014925373
7850671,5,6303589928,"What an interesting premise based on what could be actual events. For those unfamiliar with the early history of South America this is an eye opener. By turns amusing and horrifying, it is a thrill ride through time.",1363737600,2,216,4.7105263157894735
7850672,4,6303589928,"I found this movie very entertaining, although I don't know how historically accurate it may have been.
The only thing I didn't like about it was the fact that only the men were completely naked not the women and to my taste it should have been the other way around.

7850673,5,6303589928,"Here it is: the film was made in the 1970's from the perspective of Brazilian natives who most definitely do not have a euro centric viewpoint on history. Frenchman is captured by cannibals, cannibals turn out to be be easy going folk who simply live life in a way that makes sense to them. They tell frenchman, respectably well endowed frenchman as everyone in the film is naked - get ready for that trip, They tell the frenchman that he lost the war and is now both a prisoner and dinner, but that they don't think much of him and will not eat him because, right now, he hasn't proven himself worthy of that effort, Right, it is an honor to be eaten. This is where the film is sublime because who am I to say what this group of people do is or is not correct, not to be libertarian to an extreme - but these folks didn't ask europeans to come across an ocean and pass judgement on what was not understood.
So anyway - they give the Frenchman a job, a hammock, and even a real nice looking - eager to please - kind of wife. Frenchman stays for like a year - he brings the natives gunpowder - helps them win a battle against another tribe - cuts his hair in the prevailing cannibal fashions- and sits next to the chief at dinner...at dinner...at dinner.
So then one day, the chief decided that the Frenchman has proven himself, that he is now worthy to be eaten. The frenchman's native wife, who knew her job the entire time, must convince the Frenchman to accept his fate and become ""one"" with the tribe, through the only means possible.
Will the Frenchman accept this fate? Will he run away? Will he fight? What of the girl? Will the chief change his mind? You will be surprised at the end, and certainly will never forget the last image on the screen, but this movie will stay with you forever - and you don't even have to use a toothpick.",1357516800,2,1842,4.28080229226361

7850675,4,6303589928,"Set aside the profusion of naked flesh in this movie. It remains a fascinating take on what it would be like to be captured by cannibals. Immediately, I thought of the parallels between this film and the true story of Herman Melville's capture by the vicious cannibal Typees (Chronicled in his awesome first novel ""Typee"".) But the sense of tension and fear are constant and effective. At every moment you find yourself aware that this Frenchman is going to be eaten. Later in the movie, we even learn that the woman who became his ""wife"" did so partly because that would ensure her a choice bit of the Frenchman's meat. This is just a fascinating movie that I highly recommend.",1188518400,2,678,4.658333333333333
7850676,3,6303589928,"I believe it's important to note that this film is not necessarily a true story. The book was never verified, as the people were all dead the next time someone went back, therefor the account can not be stated as fact. There is also another film which tells the story slightly differently. I'm not sure which is older since I can't find the reference anywhere, but it's out there. This was a decently amusing tale, and a great demonstration of how colonists used the indigenous to further their own causes.",1172880000,2,506,4.633333333333334
7850677,4,6303589928,"In ""How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman,"" Brazilian director Nelson Pereira dos Santos recreates the overt conflict between the Europeans and the indigenous populations on the 16th century Brazilian coast.  The plot specifically concerns two groups of Europeans, the French and the Portuguese, as well as two tribes of Tupi, the Tupinamba and the Tupinuquin.  In their efforts to conquer and control the same coastlands, the two European powers each befriend one of the tribes: the French ally with the Tupinamba, the Portuguese with the Tupinuquin.  Though an obvious comparison of civilized and savage, this film daringly portrays the differing societies in all their gruesome and fascinating details, thus challenging the viewer to discover for themselves just which side, European or native, they should support.
  The action begins as the main protagonist, an unnamed Frenchman, is driven out of the French settlement for plotting to assassinate its governor.  After capturing this rogue European, a tribe of Tupinamba refuse to believe that the Frenchman is indeed French and declare him to be Portuguese.  The Frenchman, now an enemy, is destined by native custom to be consumed at a feast.  Happily, as custom also dictates, the Frenchman must before his death become a full part of the tribe by living as one with it, bestowing upon the captive a reprieve of 8 months.
  The rest of the movie examines the Frenchman's measured transformation from European to native.  Among the outward changes are the assumption of the characteristic nakedness, possession of a wife, shaving in the customary manner and learning the language of the Tupinamba.  Yet though the loss of his superficial European characteristics is important, the movie examines as well those characteristics which are left intact through the metamorphosis.  For instance, even through all his trials, the captive cannot give up his desire for wealth and gold.  In the face of opposition, even when from other Frenchmen, his civilized veneer becomes academic and the captive descends to barbarism.  The Tupi are shown as much more simple in their desires--to them it is important to receive beads and combs, but no more important than to receive guns and captives.  In comparison to the Europeans, their way seems balanced and affection for objects never overwhelms the traditional ways and beliefs.  Though to a certain extent romanticizing the natives' way of life, the director does not flinch from portraying the most gritty parts of both European and native cultures.  His eagerness to illustrate unpleasant practices is quite obvious from the title role cannibalism plays in this movie.  The concept of humans consuming one another universally repulses and begs the question of what kind of society can make such a barbaric practice a part of daily life.  Yet one of the movie's most disturbing intentions is the comparison between two kinds of death: execution or cannibalism.  The Frenchman, condemned without a word in his defense, is thrown to the sea in a shockingly perfunctory manner.  Yet those captives of the Tupi, condemned to be consumed by the tribe, are treated with respect and even honored as they live among those who will eat them.  Above all, they are allowed dignity as they die.  Thus even this seemingly simple choice of ""civilization"" versus ""savage"" becomes complex, and the choice between a callous, ignoble death and a personable, honorable one difficult.  As desired by the director, we are forced to question the ingrained knowledge perpetuated by our culture, and perhaps realize how relative the term civilization truly is.

  To some extent, all such movies that contrast the excitement of European intercontinental expansion and the resulting wanton destruction of the New World's native peoples are designed to induce viewer sympathy towards the native cause.  Yet never before has a director asked us to sympathize with cannibals.  In his dedication to an unsentimental portrayal of both cultures, Pereira dos Santos almost manages to convince us of his objectivity. That we resolve despite their abominable practice to support the natives is a considerable testament to the director's skill and evidence of the movie's hidden power.",987206400,49,4243,5.252225519287834
7850678,5,6303589928,"This video is strange, but that is because it accurately (as far as I can tell, anyway) depicts a different culture that is ""strange"" to me and probably most people.  I got caught up in the story and the setting.  I loved this video because it is true to life, showing real people and events in a litte-discussed setting in time, instead of the beautiful-star-in-beautiful-place formula which is all Hollywood can ever come up with.  I know this video is expensive, and I rented it from my college's library so I didn't have to worry about the price.  However, I think if you can find somewhere to rent it from, or wait until the price goes down, you should definitely watch it.  I even think it is worth the price because it is a refreshingly good video.  It is like a documentary in the sense that it shows a time and place and people so different from the one we are used to.  However, it has a moving plot and believable characters (not to mention the much-needed subtitles, which you'll be glad are there since the tribal people speak in their native tribal language and the main character speaks in French, and some other people speak in Portuguese :), so in that way it is definitely a movie.  I was so fed up with the cooked-up crap Hollywood always feeds everyone, so it was definitely nice to find such a different movie out there.  If you're like me, you will think this movie is strange, but you will be fascinated with it the whole time, and it will really make you think about that time period and place and people.",971827200,11,1529,4.432142857142857
