3587423,2,B001FJ5D52,"If you have already watched this show before on TV then I WOULDN'T reccommend this FULL FRAME version. You'll loose 30% of the details of the show because you know what to expect. If this is your FIRST TIME viewing it, it'll be alright BUT I'd still rather reccommend the WIDE SCREEN version",1288396800,17,291,4.509433962264151
3587424,4,B001FJ5D52,"I got a preview of the DVD over Netflix, and while I'm impressed with the content, the discs themselves are pretty poor.

The show itself is great entertainment. You don't have to feel too guilty about watching it because it doesn't play out as an educational show - just a bit of entertainment that parents wouldn't object to showing their kids. Really it's a slapstick silent comedy (with clay sheep), and the characters show personality without ever saying a word. Plus, the Wallace & Gromit creators dip into a huge pool of cultural references that's really entertaining to spot in various shorts.

Looking at the discs, well, we have a 16:9 widescreen image that was *squeezed* into a 4:3 frame rather than cropped, making everything look squished together. I'm really not confident enough to encourage paying whichever party didn't put effort into the home video version.",1288051200,12,877,5.0
3587425,2,B001FJ5D52,"Received this today as a gift.  Was first disappointed to see that they used an unnecessarily large double-wide DVD case for this release.  It's such a waste of space on the shelf.  However, I was devastated to look at the back and discover this was presented in 1.33:1 FULL FRAME.  This show is aired in 16:9 widescreen in the UK and released in that format there.  I (maybe stupidly) assumed they would release it the same way here in the US.  Such a disappointment--this show deserves a better release.  Will keep my fingers crossed for a corrected blu-ray release.",1287446400,97,568,4.6767676767676765

3587429,1,B001FJ5D52,"Over the past year Hit Entertainment has released 7 individual NTSC Region 1 DVDs of Shaun the Sheep.  Fans paid around $10 per release, making the total cost of the first season about $70.  Now, a year later, they release one box set and are only charging $22.49?

There really ought to be a law against this kind of DVD double-dipping.

3587431,5,B001FJ5D52,"Again, what is not to like about this smart and sassy sheep that is the leader of the flock, but never a bully?  He gets everyone working at a team to overcome problems, and is the first to run out to try to rescue the sassy house cat after it gets in trouble on the telephone post (they slide to safety using a pair of old underpants as a handle to land safely in the farmer's bathtub thru open window (but pants catch fire).  Silly silly silly.

Kids and adults will enjoy Season 1 and 2.  Round out your collection with Season 3 & 4 and the Shaun the Sheep first movie and you have a complete set.  That covers all the tv episodes and the movie.  Seem to be a lot of pulled episodes that are made into disks online,  but if you have 1-4, and movie, you have them all, unless there were some specials that were made for tv.

Sweet and sassy, he saves everyone, even the naughty pigs, but is not above hitting the electric shearer with a hammer to keep from getting a haircut (poor farmer, everything electrical seems to break for him anyway).  Lots of love, the farm animals love the farmer, and he is so good to them despite having to raise his voice and fist when they do something really bad (see movie for hilarious results of sheep wanting a day off and putting farmer to sleep --by counting sheep-- so they can watch videos and eat microwave popcorn).

For all ages, if you need a laugh or a smile, try Shaun the Sheep and the gang.",1507075200,,1440,4.203636363636364

Each episode is really 7 minutes. I didn't realize that for season 1 and 2, Amazon Video bundled up 3 episodes in non-chronological order. That in itself isn't a big deal however with the DVD, after every 7 minute episode, you get the credits and intro again. We miss the little transition animations from the Amazon stream, like the sheep doing a river dance or driving up in a bus.

I had bought these as separate season DVD box sets before but for the low low price and to have both seasons all in one set I bought 'em again! these are the same [British] folks that did the Chicken Run movie and the Wallace & Gromit series. there is also a spin-off show called ""Timmy Time"" featuring Timmy the little sheep. that one is really more for the very young kids - wouldn't appeal too much to older kids or adults.

3587469,5,B001FJ5D52,"For those who have seen any of the British-produced show called ""Shaun the Sheep"", it can become an obsession!
Each episode is a short (five or six minutes) cartoon about the head sheep ""Shaun the Sheep,"" the other sheep in the flock, and the other farm animals - including three pigs, several hens, and the sheepdog ""Biteser"" who is allegedly in charge of the animals.  They all live on a farm run by an unnamed farmer.  The only sounds are some background music, and the noises made by the farm animals, the farmer, visitors, etc.  That's right, no dialogue!
The show is impossible to describe, but it is funny, endearing, and totally family appropriate.
This particular Amazon offering (there are many to choose from) is in U.S. CD  format, and contains the first two seasons from British television -
a total of 80 episodes!  At a total price of less than $20, it is the best entertainment buy one can make for everyone from kids to geezers!",1478908800,2,945,4.634730538922156

or
if you install on your computer or laptop a free and legal software like VLC player, which can read DVDs from all over the world. Which is what I did and has been very useful for me ever since.

Originally, Shaun the Sheep was a guest character in Nick Park's wonderful ""Wallace and Gromit"" Series. Through the episode ""A Close Shave"" and one appearance in ""the Cracking Contractions"" series, Shaun became so popular that he has ended up with his own series. Set after the ""Wallace and Gromit"" episode, we find Shaun and his flock living at the Mossy Bottom Farm. The farmer, unnamed so far, is their owner and his dog, Bitzer, has to take care of the flock every day. Making sure that Shaun and his mates do not cause mayhem around the property and region. Which is what ends up happening under various circumstances (ex: the farmer, Bitzer, Shaun, or a sheep from the flock like Shelly and Timmy). Other characters join in the episodes of this first season. We have three pigs, a bull, a rooster, a chicken, a duck, the farmer's cat named Pidsley, the delivery guy, an old woman, and travelers who pass by the farm. A rich and diverse range of characters that bring up conflict and misadventures to the characters.

With forty episodes, this set offers the first season of this stop-motion series. Each episode is six minutes long, and unlike Wallace and Gromit, Shaun the Sheep doesn't contain any dialogues. Everything is seen from the point of view of the animals, which means that the human dialogues are mumbles, and the animals either bleat, bark, oink, or quack when they interact with each other. Not once do we get any subtitles describing what the animals are saying. Viewers therefore have to interpret the story through its images. That is characters actions, visual puns, corporal expressions, and objects interactions. With the music to complement the story's atmosphere, Shaun the Sheep is pure visual storytelling, without dialogues, making the series very exportable across the world and understandable for every ages, training the public on how to interpret people's reactions by their behaviors and reactions. Also, the writing is sharp, not infantalizing, and is aimed at every group age. Which means that even adults can appreciate the series, which is true considering some of the nice comments I read on YouTube from people who watched some episodes either alone or with their families.

In its bonuses, you have a making-of on how the series is animated, another where kids do wonderful and intelligent presentations of the characters, another making-of on how to build a pig in claymation, and a Sing-A-Long for the opening credits song.

Technically, the series is 16:9 anamorphic (set for a widescreen), in stereo, and comes with subtitles for those who have hearing issues.

As such, Shaun the Sheep is a wonderful series for people of every ages and is a wonderful Aardman masterpiece.",1418601600,,3067,4.879078694817658

They all love it and laugh with delight.  Another plus is that the bit of adult humour in each show, goes right over their heads.  They'll be in for a treat when they re-watch the shows when they're older.
-------------
I'm 59 and haven't watched this show with children, so really don't know how much of the humour they'd actually understand. I'm going to order a variety of ""Shaun the Sheep"" DVDs for my kids and grandkids, who live 2000 miles away from me.

It was my 12-yr old daughter who suggested that we give them a try, so we did.  We found them to be occasionally laugh-out-loud funny!  Every episode includes three short segments, none of which is directly linked to any other one as far as I can tell, except that the more you watch, the better you get to know the characters.  That takes a little doing, since none of them talk - ever!  I mean, the farmer does vocalize a sort of non-descript series of grunts and sounds, but there is never any real question about what he's saying.  Blitzer the sheep dog loves to kick back, listening to music on his headphones and sipping tea or having a snack, while Shaun is clearly the brains of the whole gaggle of creatures - much like Bugs Bunny was the brains of his set of characters.

Oh, I love the pigs too.  They can't stand the sheep, and the sheep live in fear of them.  That's the farm yard...oh, there's a bull too.  Watch out!

The claymation is great, but is a half a level or a full level below that of Wallace and Gromit.  Still, I enjoy watching these with my daughter.  We usually watch one episode per night.  We just finished Season one...ON TO SEASON TWO!

I wish they were Widescreen instead of Fullscreen, but the sharpness is excellent. I just wanted to say I agree with other customers that it is a wonderful series. For years I have kept my eye out for what may entertain the extended families, children, and grandchildren. That was how I discovered Thomas years ago and it was a big hit. I am now passing the word on this TV series from the UK. Although recommended for ages 5-7, younger children will enjoy it as well, and probably most ages will find something to like about this funny comedy about the adventures of a group of sheep on a farm. These are available to rent if you want to check them out first, but most families will want to own them to take them while travelling. I can't wait to see this in original format, and Blu-ray would be nice. If you enjoyed this series, be sure to see the other individual titles available on DVD.

I was watching it on the Disney Channel and could tell it was a widescreen show in the hated full frame format.  It wasn't until I got the first DVD that I discovered that Disney was also leaving out portions of the show apparently to fit a shorter time slot.  When the Region 1 complete 1st season DVD came out I was sure it would be in the widescreen version as shown in the UK.  Unfortunally it was still that nasty full screen stuff.  I was so annoyed by this that for 60 bucks I bought an ""all region"" DVD player and ordered the 1st season from Amazon UK.  It worked perfect and I can't believe how great it looks in glorious widescreen. Finally.  It was worth all the fuss.
I just changed from 2 stars to 5 stars.  I agree with other reviewers that I shouldn't rate the show low just because they issued the discs in full frame.  I am a 62 year old woman that just loves Shaun the Sheep.  My favorite episode is ""The Visitor"".",1317168000,3,1017,4.142857142857143

This might not matter to some moms, but lots of cartoon character have such grating voices I end up wanting to throw the TV out the window before the show is over! Shaun the Sheep reminds me a bit of the old Pink Panther shows.....no dialogue, but still amusing. It's a great DVD set with 280 minutes of Shaun to keep the kids happy.

I think it's even more brilliant than Wallace & Gromit; there is no speaking yet the humour is so clearly communicated.  I also love the idea of watching an episode or two as a bedtime treat, as others have suggested.

Season One includes all 40 episodes from the following separately released DVDs:

Off the Baaa (8)
Back in the Baaath (8)
Sheep on the Loose (6)
Little Sheep of Horrors (6)
A Woolly Good Time (6)
One Giant Leap for Lambkind (6)

Even if you were to purchase these separately at used prices, the price of a brand-new Season One compilation DVD is still the better value for the money.  I purchased this item as a gift for my husband and plan to give the two individual DVDs I already purchased to other family members with children so they can enjoy Shaun as well.

Other reviewers of Shaun the Sheep DVDs have taken issue with the video format (cutting off the edges of the scenes) that's released in the US.  Unfortunately we don't appear to have a choice in that and it seems unfair to rate the product poorly for a technical complaint when the content is clearly so exceptional.

In this series, he has gone to live on a farm where he directs the flock of sheep to a series of adventures (each episode around 6-8 minutes).  There is no spoken language here, all the comedy is slapstick.  Our three year old finds these hilarious and they are short enough that he can watch a ""movie"" before bed (and we can keep his screen time low!).  As an added bonus, these are funny for adults too!

These US releases are great, except that for some inexplicable reason they've all been pan-and-scanned to 4:3 screen size - which means they're cutting off a good bit of the scene, where often a lot of side details are happening.

We have region-free DVD players so we got the British version, which is the original widescreen format.
