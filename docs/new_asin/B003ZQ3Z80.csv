4235110,5,B003ZQ3Z80,"It is the year 1821 and Anne is hiking through the hills of England and comes upon her friends who are bird watching and waiting for her.  She is watching her friends from a distance through a spyglass and she is excited to see them particularly her lover and friend Mariana Belcombe.  Anna is lesbian in a time when homosexuality is not tolerated.  She is later shocked that day when it is announced that Mariana announces that she is getting married to an older and obviously not attractive man for financial reasons.  Anne is crushed and her life is in turmoil.

Anne Lister is a wealthy heiress to the estate known as Shibden Hall which is her family estate.  She lives with her aunt and uncle in the family home and none of them have ever been married.  Anne attends the wedding of Mariana and wears black to the wedding.  She looks like she is going to a funeral.  Anne is so mad she walks all the way home crying.  She is depressed and she is not eating properly. She realizes that she has to forget about Mariana.  She devotes her time to reading studying and preparing to write a book.  She writes her diary every day and some of it is in code....

This is a true story about strong willed woman who is a lesbian long before it was culturally accepted.  She has lost the love of her life and has to overcome the loss which is primarily due to the persecution that they would face if they were openly together.  She is already called Freddie by her lover and Gentleman Jack by the people in town.  Despite her troubled life she leads a role in developing a coal mining operation on her extensive estate property and meets up with another wealthy woman who also owns an estate and wants to be with Anne.

All of her life she kept a diary and about 1/6 of the pages were written in a code.  Anne was a scholar in ancient Greek and mathematics and her code was only broken 150 years after her death.  This is an excellent story of how she stood up for her rights and made a life for herself.  The movie was very good and well-acted out and it is an excellent DVD release from BBC Home Entertainment.  My wife and I enjoyed watching it and we recommend it to you.

I was provides a copy of the DVD for review purposes and I promised to give a fair and honest review.",1349740800,7,2270,4.2669789227166275
4235111,5,B003ZQ3Z80,"I am drawn to stories about strong female characters, especially those who have defied social conventions to prove their worth and to stand up for what they believe in. Initially, I was not sure if I would be engaged by a story that focuses on lesbian themes, but Anne Lister's powerful story was captivating to say the least and her emotional struggles seemed very real and human to me. I received the DVD courtesy of BBC America and am glad to have obtained some illuminating insights into the story of this remarkable woman who was quite a revolutionary for her time. It is based on the true story of Anne Lister, a landowner, pioneer industrialist, a savvy businesswoman, and a woman who was openly lesbian.

Anne Lister is a wealthy orphan residing in 19th century Yorkshire with her aunt and uncle. The story focuses on Anne's relationships, primarily her life-long love affair with Marianna Belcombe&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masterpiece-Theatre-Secret-Life-of-Mrs-Beeton/dp/B000PFUA7S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masterpiece Theatre - Secret Life of Mrs. Beeton</a>&nbsp;and as the insufferable Lucy Steele in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sense-Sensibility-Miss-Austen-Regrets/dp/B0012OVCE6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sense & Sensibility / Miss Austen Regrets</a>) . Anne (portrayed in a powerful performance by Maxine Peake) is utterly shattered when Marianna's family announce her engagement to wealthy older widower Charles Lawton. Anne begs Marianna to reconsider and to marry her (Anne) instead, but Marianna is adamant,deciding to honor her family's wishes and consoles Anne saying that they can still meet occasionally and be together when time permits. A year goes by with no word from Marianna, and the despondent Anne throws herself into scholarship and minor love affairs (though I read elsewhere that she went through many more love affairs than those depicted on screen).

Anne is very much like a man in voicing her opinions - she is outspoken and even dresses in an unfeminine manner, choosing dark colors and going for comfortable, asexual clothes rather than vanity. She has a brilliant mind, and pours her heart out in her journals, written in code so that no one else can read them, except for some very intimate friends. These very same journals were discovered in Shibden Hall (where Anne lived) 150 years after her death (she died at the age of 49 while hiking through the Caucasus Mountains in 1840).

The story is in essence about a woman's struggles to be true to herself and fulfill the desires of her heart in a world which was very unforgiving and socially conservative, a world that frowned upon lesbians, and made life difficult for those that dared defy social conventions. I must warn that the sexual scenes are quite explicit, and there's lots of nudity though I also felt the scenes were restrained, focusing on the passion and natural affection between the women than exploitative. Even though I'm a heterosexual woman, I empathized with Anne's plight and her frustrations at not being able to be with the love of her life. Anne Lister is a sympathetic character yet her indomitable spirit inspired me for she possessed a truly 'natural' character (as one woman characterizes Anne), one who dared to defy conventions and be true to her real nature. The feature runs 91 minutes, with the option of English subtitles. There are two extras which are illuminating for the discerning viewer:

Well I bought this movie on the off chance that my dvd player would play this format. I had seen snippets of this movie on Youtube and was very intrigued and more than a little frustrated that the entire story was not there! I enjoy watching quality women loving films. Don't care at all for those cheesy lesbian romps that are just trashy porn. I especially am interested in movies that portray women loving relationships of different time periods. Because we all know gays existed throughout history, they didn't just crop up in the last couple centuries! So I bought this movie and sadly discovered my dvd player was not compatible. But... gladly my computer had no such qualms! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!! :-)

First I must say that Miss Anne lived wayyy before her time! She was a very passionate woman in her pursuits and her love for Marianna. She and her friend Tib complete their circle of friends. Indeed, they are all special friends! This movie is Sense and Sensibility meets the L Word, if the L Word were a show of lord and ladies in the 1800s, that is! Miss Anne and Marianna are and unofficial couple of their trio. But as the movie unfolds, the viewer finds that Tib her self is in mad love with Miss Anne. And Anne is like the Shane of this movie breaking hearts in her wake. After Marianna marries the old and rather plump Lord Lawton, Anne is left to waste away her time pining away for her lost love. Much like the lovers of Broke Back Mountain, these two lovers can scarcely find time to break away in their strict society and lives to chisel a piece of time for themselves. And in the lapse of time between their assignations, Anne and Tib find solace in each other. However, while it but marked time for Anne, Tib fell more deeply under her friend's spell. And when Anne does meet with her love, Marianna wants to keep Anne all to herself and is jealous to find that Anne and Tib continue their connection in her stead.  Anne also tries to quit her love for Marianna by trying to find another like her in their small town. But the girl she sets her sights on, miss Brown proves too young and innocent in the ways of the world. She manages to kiss her once to initiate her in her and Tib's circle, but she proves shy even as she is quite drawn to Anne. After Anne goes off to meet her true love and they promise to join in marriage and live together after Lord Lawton passes, they make necklaces of their engagement rings. When she returns home, the shy miss Brown actually seems eager to continue her friendship with Anne and begs her to call on her. But Anne is no longer on the prowl as she has been assured that she and Marianna will truly one day live as husband and wife and live at her estate that she eventually inherits from her uncle.

Tib finally realizes that Anne is still and irrevocably over the moon over Marianna and at last sees that she is not Anne's first choice. So after a very enlightening quarrel, Tib vows to never bother Anne again and leaves, never to return. But like Brokeback, Anne and Marianna's strained relationship hits some snags. A scorned suitor for Anne spreads some rumors about her and Marianna to Marianna's husband of all people. He becomes suspicious and as a result, she sends back all the coded love letters that Anne had written over the years and asks that she not write anymore for a while. More time goes by and Anne and Marianna set up another meeting at an inn near Anne's town. They too quarrel over their future. Anne discovers that Marianna wants them to have a future continuing on as they have been, with her married and Anne patiently waiting until they can meet a few times a year. She deeply wounds Anne in saying that they couldn't possibly marry and the last thing she wanted was for their affair to become public knowledge. Anne accuses her of stringing her along all this time since she knows that Anne wants to share her life with someone. Marianna can only watch as Anne yanks off her engagement ring/necklace and tosses it to the floor and stalks out.

Ironically, Anne finds another wealthy young heiress , miss Walker, like herself and begins a new friendship. They begin to each harvest coal from their estates and sell it. The old scorned suitor of Anne's is in the same business and tries to intimidate the ladies since they are his competition. Finally they drive him off but not before Anne and her new friend move in together for safety reasons. But Ms. Walker's aunt comes by to appeal to her niece that town people were talking about her living with the mannish Anne and that she will ruin her chances for a decent marriage and ruin the family name. Ms. Walker states that she doesn't want a husband and the aunt leaves. Miss Walker tells Anne that she wants to stay and live romantically with her. Anne is pleasantly surprised. She burns all of Marianna's love letters and has a private wedding ceremony with Ms. Walker, exchanging rings. Together, they live in her estate with Anne's elderly aunt. More time goes by and they are getting along fine until Marianna shows up. She tells her that she thinks she can finally leave Lord Lawton since he has a mistress. Anne is saddened and tempted, but tells her that she has a new life now and that she likes miss Walker very much. Marianna questions the like, but Anne is unwavering and eventually Marianna leaves.

This was a very good movie, but the ending was bittersweet. I would totally recommend this movie, if you can find a version that will play here in the states. Apparently it is based on a true story. Miss Anne did indeed write coded love letters to Marianna. Anne died at 49 of a fever that she caught while traveling through the mountains with her wife. Her letters were coded using algebra and the Greek language, and were found around the 1930s and decoded. A clever girl, that miss Anne. She managed to live out her dream of an independent woman of means and free from being under any husband's yolk. Well, it was a dream amended since she never got her true love, but she did marry a woman and lived happy until her death.",1293321600,37,6138,4.5004484304932735

4235117,5,B003ZQ3Z80,"this story was very good, easy to watch,
it about two women back in England or London years ago,
the way the people dress in the movie is fitting for the time,
but the main part of the show is about two women that fall in love over the years
and one decides to go off and get married to a man and leaves the other back to figure
out how to live life without her, the reason this happens is, back in the day,
marrying a same sex partner could either get you killed or just ruin your business or
att he very least your life.
so, these two women would find a way to meet each other , even though one was married to a man,
she keeps telling the other women , as soon as my husband passes on, we can be together,
now does it ever happen and how do these two women find a way to still connect with each other over the years?
this is not a typical lesbian movie by no means, its more like a soap opera  made in the 1930's and 40's
i would recommend this movie to anyone ! well maybe not to small kids.

The cast was excellent, with rich, believable performances by Maxine Peake as the lead Anne Lister and Susan Lynch as her friend Tib. The other actors and actresses - including the woman who played Lister's aunt - were also very strong. This show contained a nice mix of drama and sly comedy/wordplay! Lister was a woman who was ahead of her times; I have not yet read the biography about her but, from what I have gathered, she was also pretty conservative and unwieldy in her political beliefs. It would  have been nice if this film had delved into other parts of her life.

I saw this movie on Out tv. As soon as I saw that it was going to be a period piece,
I groaned. Just another Jane Austen piece of polite women tittering. I really dislike
Period movies.
It was the intelligent face of the lead character ( Maxine Peake) that kept me
Watching.
I had never heard of Maxine Peake before this movie. What a shame. She gives a stunning
Performance as Miss Anne Lister.
I cannot imagine what kind of character Anne Lister must have had to live as an openly
Gay woman in the 1800's. That's incredible. She was incredible. She kept a very detailed
Diary of her life,which was a showcase for life in the Regency period,which is the same period as that of Jane Austen. She wrote 4 MILLION words in her diary.
The parts that pertained to her Lesbian romances were written in code and took almost
A hundred years to decode and then were hidden for approx.another 100 yrs.because of their explicit nature.
The movie tries to tell us what her life was like back then. It really required 2 discs
To give us the full picture. However we do get a taste of her times.

4235156,5,B003ZQ3Z80,"Set in 19th century Yorkshire, this film tells the true story of Anne Lister (Maxine Peake), a wealthy landowner who lives life to the fullest and refuses to marry. Instead, Anne pursues a series of romantic relationships with women in an effort to find someone to settle down with in a loving relationship.

Betrayed by her first love, Marianna (Anna Madeley), Anne is tormented by disappointment. When she meets Ann Walker (Christine Bottomley) another wealthy, unmarried woman, they forge both a business and personal alliance becoming two of the earliest female industrialists.

Director James Kent has created a thoughtful and witty film full of strong female characters. The film is based on the diaries of British socialite Anne Lister. Cleverly encoded in a combination of algebra and Ancient Greek, the diaries were only decoded 150 years after her death.

Maxine Peake is wonderful as Anne Lister; the stolen moments of passion between Anne and Marianna are exquisite. Susan Lynch is outstanding as Tib, Anne's long-time friend and ex-lover.

4235162,4,B003ZQ3Z80,"I saw this back in 2010 when it first came out and had some mixed feelings about it.  I mostly love all things BBC and I certainly wasn't disappointed by the acting, costumes, and setting.  But the theme of losing the woman who makes you passionate-crazy to an old fat rich dude for the sake of fitting in to society was more than a little depressing.  That, and I didn't care much for the casting.

When I watched it again over the holidays, I appreciated it much more.  I still hate some of the casting, and it's way too short, but I feel differently about the theme now.  And Anne Lister is just a fascinating woman to learn about.

This bio is a snapshot in the life of Anne Lister (1791-1840), and is based on her many diaries which were partially written in a complicated code of Greek letters and algebraic expressions.  She was a landowner and a shameless lesbian who remained unmarried and lived an independent lifestyle in 19th century Yorkshire when women just didn't do these things (it's the time of Jane Austen).  She never catered to the societal constraints of her time and she was very smart and an ambitious businesswoman.

This bit of her life chronicles her passionate and heartbreaking relationship with Mariana Belcombe who is beautiful, alluring, and returns Anne's love mutually.  She's the prettiest actress cast here (not even close to an L Word cast in looks), but I struggled to like her because she starred in Affinity (by Sarah Waters) and was not a likable lead... and Affinity kinda sucked. Eventually, I came to think the casting reflected Lister's obsession for Mariana because no one else could compare and I accepted it for what it was.

Unlike Lister, Mariana doesn't believe two women can live independently together and she marries hoping she can still keep Lister on the side.  Lister is traumatized but too bullheaded to accept this and ultimately finds another.  Initially, I didn't like the loss and cynicism that led her to settle for someone she wasn't passionate about.  But I recognized the maturity and character growth in doing so and I liked her more for that in the end.

If you read up on the real Lister or watch the DVD extras, you'll learn she was very dykey looking and grew to be very butch with age... she even had some serious facial hair. Mariana was ashamed to be seen with her in public and people in town nicknamed her Gentleman Jack. I just think the casting could have reflected that much more.  The actress who played her was very talented and certainly embodied the arrogance and predatory qualities Lister is said to have... but not so much the butch or seductive charm.  She was mostly pushy, self-absorbed, and unlikable.

This role called for a sexy butch. But heck, I wouldn't have complained with an actual L Word type cast. Nice introduction of a fascinating woman... just not enough depth, charm, or eye candy here to be a solid hit.",1357430400,,2908,4.666666666666667
