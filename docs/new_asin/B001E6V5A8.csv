I have never seen Portrait of Grandpa Doc presented on any of the TV networks, but it has the potential to become a classic model of the bonds that quality time and activities strengthen between the older and younger generations.  Much of the setting appears to be the Jersey Shore BEFORE it  was so recently devastated by Major Storm Sandy in 2012.  This film appeals and surprises on so many levels.  The superb cast brings it to life and the experience will become an indelible memory and a positive guide for anyone who wishes to extend a hand to a youngster to help ""pull them up.""  It truly deserves a much larger audience.",1358467200,,797,4.823529411764706
8296939,5,B001E6V5A8,"A must have for any grandparent that has developed a special relationship with a particular grand child or children. The relationship has all of the trademark challenges that a grandparent (grandfather) can expect when bonding with one particular grandchild. What makes the relationship special is the obvious love between the grandfather and grandson. It's clearly a loving relationship on both ends, an understanding between one beginning his life and the other preparing for the end. This film (story) will be a gift from me; to my precious grand-daughter Mia, currently age seven. Someday, it will tell her how I feel about her and what we have between us, just us! Like so many grandparents that have that special bond with a grandchild, Portrait of Grandpa Doc is our story, Mia and me, Grandpa Joe. January 2013. Enjoy...",1357084800,,828,5.0510948905109485
8296940,5,B001E6V5A8,"This particular movie is an awesome literary work.  The plot, character development, symbolism, point of view, vocabulary usage, are excellent.  I most appreciate being able to use this in the clasroom for discussion of literature and ultimately as a writing assignment.  It's also excellent for introspection as well as just a great family movie.",1355875200,,347,5.388888888888889
