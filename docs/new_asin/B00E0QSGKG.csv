5883108,4,B00E0QSGKG,"One of these episodes (""A Voice in the Night"") is excellent, but the other, ""A Ray of Light"", is ruined for me because the story involves two of the characters experiencing premonitions. (I won't give away any more - I don't want to spoil it for those who have not seen the episodes yet.) Despite this, I am still giving four stars, because no Montalbano fan could do without having the good episode.

At their best, Camilleri's Montalbano stories (both the books and the TV version) are brilliant. The successful Montalbano formula involves: our hero's quirky but endearing character; the interplay between Montalbano and his team; lots of humour; the beautiful Sicilian scenery; and the occasional critical social comment from Camilleri's left-leaning point of view (especially in the books).

But although I am a great fan of Montalbano, I am not an uncritical one: there have been some disappointments. For example, ""The Age of Doubt"" was a dismal offering, and I found the grim description of the aftermath of the murder in ""The Treasure Hunt"" unpleasant and distasteful. (The latter was toned down a bit in the TV version.) Camilleri's tone is usually light and humorous, with just the occasional gory murder or dark episode. But, especially recently, it seems that Camilleri is sometimes going over the top in showing us that his work can have a dark side.

The other thing that has spoilt some of the Montalbano stories for me has been when Camilleri has brought in some sort of paranormal incident. (Detective stories have to be plausible if I am going to enjoy them.) For example, in ""The Track of Sand"" there is a brief episode where Montalbano seems to be living out events that he has previously experienced in a premonition-type dream. Similarly, in ""August Heat"" we have an incident involving telepathy between twins, and in ""The Scent of the Night"" there is a surreal happening in which Montalbano finds himself living out scenes from a novel he has previously read.

Up until now, these paranormal incidents have generally featured in the books but not so much in the TV versions. However, as I stated above, we now have characters experiencing premonitions in a TV episode.  Perhaps this doesn't bother some fans, but for me it's very disappointing and annoying.

Montalbano has bounced back before after a disappointing book or TV episode. I hope he can do so again.

5883109,5,B00E0QSGKG,"Brilliant directing, acting, writing (Andrea Camilleri) and the Sicilian Scenery is simply breathtaking.  Love Luca Zingaretti as Montalbano and the remaining cast are equally excellent.",1382745600,,186,6.44
5883110,5,B00E0QSGKG,"This series has been really entertaining!  The characters are all great and completely believable. There is always an excellent story line, suspense, murder, love, and laughter.  You will not be disappointed in any of the episodes in this series.  But, keep your dvd control handy to stop and reverse...the Sicilians talk very very fast and the English subtitles don't stay on the screen long (:-)) Enjoy!",1382572800,,405,5.106060606060606

5883112,5,B00E0QSGKG,"For viewers who have followed the entire Montalbano series, Episode 26 is a must-see.  This is one of the best, weaving together multiple story lines from previous episodes and culminating in a particularly powerful ending.  Of course, Fazio, Augella and Catarella are all present and do their parts in creating a lot of smiles along the way.  I hope there will be more to come.",1380672000,11,378,4.7846153846153845

The only thing we hated about some of the last few episodes is Montalbano suddenly had too many lovers.  We liked him better when he was in a more meaningful  relationship and not changing women like shirts.  Oh, and the scenery is just too beautiful for words.",1424563200,,353,4.369230769230769

5883130,3,B00E0QSGKG,"I have read almost all of Camilleri's books and seen quite a few of the screen editions also. But if these two are anything to judge by , then the later episodes are very hard to follow. There is too much dialogue to be able to read the subtitles while they are on the screen. And anyway , you are so busy reading that you can't take in the marvellous scenery and all ...  After it was over , all 4 of us watching it were  worn out from reading and confused about the ending ....the earlier episodes that were actually written as books are much better !",1404691200,,553,4.111111111111111

8599911,5,B00E0QSGKG,"ALERT: Manufacturers Error (with update)

This is not a review of Episodes 25 and 26, which I have yet to view, for the reason that follows. Those of you who are poised to post a comment expressing your criticism of my posting a review without having seen the episodes in question, please point me to a ratings-neutral forum on this products page where the sort of problem I describe can be brought to the attention of others.

I have twice ordered this two-episode set from Amazon, and twice I have returned it, and for the same reason: the manufacturer has mislabeled the DVDs. The label of the DVD of Episode 25 carried the correct title, A voice in the Night. But when I played the DVD, I found that it actually contained Episode 23, Angelicas Smile. Similarly, the label of the DVD of Episode 26 carried the correct title, A Ray of Light, but it contained Episode 24, Mirror Effect. Given the fact that mine appears to be the first report of this problem (which I encountered in September/October 2017), the problem is likely a recent one (though not an isolated one: it happened twice to me).

As for the series itself, I hope that the fact I own the entire series speaks for itself, as does the 5-star rating.

UPDATE: I waited four months (until March 2018) before again ordering this, and I am pleased to report that the episodes on the DVDs I received are the correct ones.",1508457600,2,1383,4.52
