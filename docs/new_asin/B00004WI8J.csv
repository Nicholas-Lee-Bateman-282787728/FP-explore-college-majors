8366130,5,B00004WI8J,"Who was behind the murder of progressive Swedish leader Olof Palme in 1986? More than twenty years after the deed, the crime remains unsolved. This fictionalized account of that assasination avoids naming real names behind the murder, but it suggests an international right wing conspiracy. The movie is shot as a thriller and the main characters are a Swedish police officer who suspects something big and ominous is going to happen in his country and tries unsuccessfully to prevent it, a mysterious but strangely charming British contract killer ready to pull the trigger, and a beautiful Swedish journalist whose choice of lover ends quite badly for her. I found this movie quite interesting, even though I know very little about Swedish politics.",1419897600,2,751,5.163934426229508
8366131,4,B00004WI8J,"This is an absorbing drama based on the assassination of Olof Palme, and has divergent stories: the killer himself, and the one investigator in particular trying to solve it, and having difficulties thrown in his way.
Michael Kitchen is superb and Mikael Persbrandt is a marvel in this. The ending was a complete surprise!",1232928000,10,322,4.981481481481482
