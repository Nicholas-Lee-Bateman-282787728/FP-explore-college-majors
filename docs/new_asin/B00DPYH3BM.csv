5847000,1,B00DPYH3BM,"I originally saw part of this movie while I was overseas and I wanted to watch the entire movie. So, when I found it on Amazon I was excited to order and watch this film. I personally enjoyed the movie. What I didn't enjoy was paying $20 for a bootleg movie. I thought buying the product from Amazon it would be legitimate merchandise. Well, unfortunately I was wrong. You can tell the movie quality is not quite what it should be and the paper placed inside the sleeve of the DVD case was crudely cut. I wouldnt recommend purchasing this movie unless you really want to watch the movie, otherwise I would find it somewhere else.",1392508800,3,629,4.431034482758621

5847003,5,B00DPYH3BM,If you like corny action comedy mixed in with classic chinese fables this is for you I love this movie there are none quite like this,1515456000,,133,4.153846153846154
5847004,5,B00DPYH3BM,Hilarious movie and engaging martial arts action. Good special effects and silly story line maintain the viewers interest. A sequel was produced and is recommended if you enjoyed the 1st movie.,1514678400,,193,5.258064516129032
5847005,5,B00DPYH3BM,I am here for Shu Kei since I haven't watch her in a new movie for a long time. This one seems to have some indirect connection to the The Chinese Odyssey Story as a prequel starring Stephen Chow himself and Chu Yan in the 1990s. That one is the ultimate classic. Love this one too.,1514160000,,282,4.053571428571429
5847006,1,B00DPYH3BM,"A spectacular travesty, if you know the beloved folk tale! The movie does NOT tell the story of a pacifist religious holy man and his rascally but faithful companions on a long journey to find Truth. [Shoulda been -- The lovable rascals need redemption but protect the pacifist monk from flesh eating demons along the way, with humorous asides.] Worst yet, on its own merits it is barely a made up prelude or origin story bogged down by endlessly long violent set pieces that have no rhyme nor reason to be there. And the movie ends. Huh? The female characters are out of context except for the poor village women. Discs okay.
[The Forbidden Kingdom is much closer to the spirit of the real ""Journey to the West."" The female lead is great and plausible in context, with Jackie Chan & Jet Li together & funny!]",1510012800,,809,4.5479452054794525

5847009,5,B00DPYH3BM,"Fantastic movie. Has comedy and drama: you will laugh and cry. Plenty of nice action, both fantastical and martial. A somewhat surprising take on Monkey King at the end but that worked surprisingly well too. I loved Kung Fu Hustle and loved this one even more.

5847011,3,B00DPYH3BM,"This is Jerry Lewis meets Little Shop of Horrors in Chinese.  Trouble is, it hits so many off-notes as to be just a bloody bore.  Things happen that don't make any sense--lots of them.  From a Western perspective, its obvious the film makers just don't have a clue about comedy, as they beat to death very unfunny jokes.  The Plot jumps around, like the so-called ""demons"", without much inventiveness.  The movie plods on, supported by its special effects which are hardly believable.  Even Buddha can't save this film.  I was hoping for a touch of wit, but everything in the movie gets hit over the head with a rubber mallet.  Don't waste your time.",1505174400,,650,4.640350877192983

5847039,5,B00DPYH3BM,"With offerings like this Hollywood best beware.

There are cultural differences in the story telling and it seems to borrow some anime themes. A big example is the hopeful idiot hero and the worldly lady ass kicker that becomes infatuated with him.

Also with a lot of Asian material there is no guarantee of a traditional happy ending. I won't spoil this one, but Disney would have too alter the ending.

This movie does a lot right. Some of the fight sequences are long but they are in general well done and entertaining. The story clips along at a good pace and had very few lulls. For the most part the characters are likable. There is an obvious fantasy theme and it is very well done with fantastic monsters, powers, and gorgeous scenery.

I would almost recommend this as a good fantasy film for all ages but it does cover sex, death, and to a lesser extent cannibalism. The bad guys do terrible things and they are often more than hinted at. There is no female nudity of note, you do see some man nipples and there is plenty of sexual innuendo at times. I would advise watching it with the kids so you can explain what is going on.",1474761600,,1139,4.40952380952381

The pig demon was theatrical dancer-like as beauty in disguise and I believe was the best demon creature compared to the fish monster and monkey king. The hero monk demon hunter at first felt like a failure but with just a bit more training and persistence should later on turn him into a pro, even though an insignificant-looking child's rhyme book seems to remind me of the girl's lollipop in Kung Fu Hustle with secret Buddha super powers. Unique ancient Chinese music soundtrack, Chinese sound effects, and maybe a few songs to add diversity to adversity of this tragicomedy film.",1471737600,,843,5.115942028985507

I don't know a thing about the original story, but the movie was fast paced, funny as heck, and action packed with good special effects. I watched the subtitled version, so I don't know how bad the dubbing is. I've read it's pretty bad. Anyhow, great film!",1470528000,,380,4.602941176470588

The action and Cinema Graphics blend so well and look as if your watching a reality show.  The movie is subtitled in English for the non Chinese speaking audience.

Make a memory, share a laugh, get excited, be afraid.  All that is possible with this movie.  Just know that once that two hours is gone you're going to ask yourself two important questions.  1) What the hell did I just watch?  2) Is there more where that came from, because I need there to be more.
The answers to those questions are. 1) Does it really matter?  That was freaking awesome wasn't it? 2) Yes.  Try Kung Fu Hustle if you haven't already.",1462924800,,615,4.28695652173913

It might bother you that the audio doesn't match the lips but it did not bother me at all.  I could totally enjoy how colorful this film was and the fantastic special effects that were part of this film.

More actors include Shu Qi as Miss Duan, Show Luo as Prince, Xing Yu as Fist of the North Star. And the brightest and biggest Zhang Chao Li as Almighty Foot.

5847160,3,B00DPYH3BM,"I wouldn't say that I'm a fan of Stephen Chow's movies, but I do like what I've seen so far. Kung Fu Hustle was one of the best movies I saw the year it came out, and CJ7 was a heartwarming family movie that didn't get the attention it deserved. A few years ago when I found out he was going to be taking on the classic tale Journey to the West, I got excited. I knew he wouldn't do a straight adaptation of the story. Sure enough, that's what this is, for better or worse. Journey to the West is a clutter-fest action/romance/comedy that's sure to win over some of his fans, although I sure wouldn't recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen one of his films before. For anyone who has seen Chow's films before, rent it before you make a purchase.

We follow the journey of Xuanzang, a demon hunter who prefers to keep them alive once he's caught them, for he is a Buddhist and believes that everyone is born good, and can be restored to their original ways. The movie opens with him trying to help a village in trouble- a massive fish has eaten several people, including a little girl, and the only other one who seemed capable of doing anything at first was a fraud priest. Things start to go in Xuanzang's favor until the demon, who reverts back to his human form, begins to beat him in the middle of a prayer. Enter Miss Duan- a lovely demon hunter who shows no mercy, employing her martial arts techniques as well as her magical rings to put demons in their place. She ends up saving the village from the demon in the end, and Xuanzang goes back to his master, who tries to make him feel better. At the same time, another demon has been discovered, and he's much tougher than the fish was. Duan and Xuanzang embark on a journey to stop him, while Duan immediately develops feelings for Xuanzang and tries her best to win him over, no matter how much he resists. It's hard work being a Buddhist demon hunter.

To me, the best thing this movie had going for it was a solid cast. You get two great stars and a large handful of characters that range from interesting to just plain weird. If you thought the cast of Kung Fu Hustle was diverse, Journey to the West just might have it beat. I loved Qi Shu as Miss Duan. Her martial arts abilities are some of the best I've seen in the last couple of years, and her comedic timing and facial reactions when hitting on Xuanzang had me laughing out loud a couple of times. Zhang Wen as Xuanzang may have a wig that puts Dae-su's (from Oldboy) to shame, but when you get past that, you see that this guy can give a good performance, even if he's being sad while being comedic. One scene that comes to mind is when he's crying about how he failed to save a few people from the fish demon, including the little girl. It's touching, and then he goes and keeps going back to his master for a hug, after his master already sends him off with words of encouragement, and gets more annoyed each time Xuanzang comes back. A few familiar faces from Chow's other movies make brief appearances, including Tailor from Kung Fu Hustle as one of Duan's friends. Special recognition goes to Chrissie Chow, who plays Duan's younger sister. She's a stunner to say the least. I wish more time was spent with some of these characters (aside from Chrissie for obvious reasons) because there was a lot of potential. There are three masters that appear halfway through the movie- one who can fight with the spirit of a tiger, one with a tiny little leg that can grow to the size of a large tree for huge kick attacks, and another sickly master named Prince Important, who fights by flicking tiny swords from a box. Prince Important at least got some good moments, including one with one of his maidens when he coughs, as if to make an important gesture, and she continuously asks ""what's that mean? Why don't you just say something?"", making fun of this would-be generic character you always see in films like this. And then there's the comedy, which Chow delivers in spades once again. I won't say much for it, as to not ruin the surprises.

I also have to give a special mention to Duan's method of capturing demons. She uses a bag that has a little container at the bottom, that kind of acts like a Ghostbuster trap. The fact that she doesn't kill the fish demon, and leaves it in the little container shows that she respects the monk's strict no-killing stance. Stillall I could think was Ghostbusters whenever she busted out the bag.

The problems I have with the film are few, but enough to make me take the rating down a bit. First is the terrible CG. Look, I know China doesn't have the budget or studios to put out movies that look like anything the US has made in the last 20 years. Look at Terminator 2, and it still holds up to this day. Kung Fu Hustle's CG was barely acceptable when it came out in 2004. 10 years later, Journey to the West's special effects look THE SAME as Kung Fu Hustle's. When the demon fish first emerged, I was expecting a comedic scene to take place because of how goofy it looked. Instead, it took a serious twist, and left me feeling confused about it. There are some practical effects used that look ok, but anything computer generated looks awful, especially scenery. There's no other way to put it. It really hurts during the film's climax, which could've been more satisfying had they been able to get more money or a better team to put something together. Heck, they could've just not taken the CG approach and done something entirely different and came to the same result. My other issue is how scattered the movie is. It moves at a fast pace, and never once did I get bored while watching it. The plot is interesting enough, regardless of just how much (or little) it follows the classic tale, but it just moves so fast that it feels like they want to get on to the next scene. I get that this isn't supposed to be a serious romance, yet the bits with Duan showing affection could've been something more if they had spent a few more minutes with it. This is the kind of movie that might have been better as a two-parter. There's certainly enough material to be spread across two films.

I really want to give this movie 4 stars, since there's a lot that I like about it, but it wouldn't feel right. If Amazon allowed half stars in their ratings, I'd give it 3.5. 3 stars is still a good rating if you ask me. Journey to the West is enjoyable- it has some memorable characters, some truly funny scenes, great work on costumes and makeup, and a nice soundtrack that borrows a few tracks from previous Chow movies. It's definitely worth watching at least once. I don't think I'll be buying it any time soon unless it goes down in price a little more. Hopefully Stephen can get a little more for special effects on his future projects, because he's a very capable director and actor, and I'd hate to see him left in the dust.",1408233600,2,6887,4.373145979703357

As for the CGI, I did think the water demon looked cool, as well as the monkey king, and the tiger demon hunter.

5847180,4,B00DPYH3BM,"Journey to the West: Conquering Demons is a blast from start to finish. It's a beautiful, if violent and sometimes downright scary tale based on popular Chinese mythological characters and stories that are centuries old. Director Stephen Chow is right at home with this material, concocting a story with likable characters and crazy fight scenes to keep you entertained. It's pretty much a guarantee that you will enjoy this movie if you enjoyed Kung Fu Hustle and Shaolin Soccer but this movie does fall behind those two in my opinion. It's still a lot of fun to watch but KFH and SS were both pretty crazy from start to finish where Journey to the West isn't.

The audio and video transfer is splendid. You'll notice right at the beginning when the shot swoops down from the sky into this Chinese fishing village just how clear the picture is. The lossless DTS-MA track is top notch as well. There's a scene where the film's heroine goes to town on a bunch of charging baddies using her magic rings and when she lets them fly, every single speaker gets involved and it'll practically have you ducking for cover. The film is presented just about flawlessly on this Blu-Ray, so that much can be attested to. The extras are okay but nothing special. There's not much to go on here save for some humorous behind-the-scenes clips and interviews with the cast and crew.

It should also be noted that this film has moments where it might be a bit too much for younger viewers to handle. One segment has a fair amount of bloodshed and others are just disturbing in general. Be mindful because while most of the movie is lighthearted, some scenes come out of nowhere and darken the mood.

I'd totally recommend this film and the Blu-Ray. It's a lot of fun and up there with Stephen Chow's other popular films. If you're looking for a good kung fu flick with a bit of fantasy mixed in, you can't go wrong with this.",1403395200,9,1907,4.5701754385964914
5847181,4,B00DPYH3BM,"It doesn't contain as much humor as Kung Fu Hustle did, but the overall story is pretty cool, and I enjoyed all the Chinese mythology that was used in the film.",1403395200,,160,4.193548387096774
5847182,3,B00DPYH3BM,"This is a comparison of the film with ""Kung Fu Hustle""- the 2004 masterpiece by the same director.
Director Stephen Chow repeats his favorite themes:
The clueless, bumbling young man, rises through adversity, and attains love and spiritual enlightenment.
He becomes a hero, and resolves the conflict with the smiting palm of Buddha,
rediscovering the primal goodness in the heart of the villain.
There's again a fat woman-if only in cameo, and plenty of homosexual innuendos.
However, except for the first part of the film-in the fight with the ""Fish Demon"",
there's liitle of the manic cascade of action and images we loved in  ""Kung Fu Hustle"":
Missing is the magical touch of action choreographers Sammo Hung and Yuen Woo Ping.
Although acting is on purpose over the top, the film isn't even half as funny as ""Kung Fu Hustle"".
I agree with several other reviewers that the ""Monkey King"" part of the film was the weakest.
The story abruptly becomes too serious and preachy, and the special effects of the conflict
with the ""Monkey King"" are crummy.
The blu-ray extras are disappointing too. They are liitle more than teasing snippets of the film.
Finally, a comment on the cheap quality of the blu-ray box, which is  little thicker
than plastic sheet. The box was crushed flat in the padded envelope of Amazon,
but the disc survived!",1403136000,2,1335,4.8766519823788546

Yes, the joke was funny...no, the jokes not funny when it's repeated 10 times straight. The movie s worth a watch, but not worth a buy.",1402876800,,442,4.67948717948718
5847184,5,B00DPYH3BM,"ONCE UPON a time, a young Buddhist monk  Chen Xuanzhang  traveled the Chinese countryside to rid the people of bloodthirsty demons that plagued their villages. Armed only with a book of 300 Childrens Nursery Rhymes, Chen wasn't very good at it, but his heart was pure and his determination boundless. He met other demon hunters along the way; some were phonies and some were genuine, but all were in it for the money  the reward offered by the poor villagers (who could be really nasty once riled up).

Along the way, Chen finds out the demons were once human. But because of terrible, unjust deaths, they were transformed into vengeance-seeking monsters.

The path to enlightenment is full of irony. And in this case, lots of laughs and a few tears.

Director/writer Stephen Chow  Shaolin Soccer (2001), Kung Fu Hustle (2004) and CJ7 (2008)  spins the 16th century Chinese literary classic, Journey to the West, into a fantastic blend of hilarity and tragedy. He keeps the laughs coming. Ever imagine what it might be like to beat up a life-sized squeaky toy? Chow will demonstrate  although, in a following sequence, you could be swallowing the lump in your throat from a heartbreaking sequence.

How does he do this  balance slapstick with tragedy? Chows is a one-of-a-kind, international talent. Theres no predicting what hell show us.

The HD picture is exquisite. Visuals blend camera work and CQI into something like a mix of realistic animation. Color is extraordinary, beginning with the turquoise lagoon and golden ochre village of the opening scene. A monster fish  part carp, part tiger, all big-eyes and dragony-teeth  torments the fishermen and their families shades of Spielbergs Jaws. We meet Chen (Zhang Wen, The Emperor and the White Snake, 2011) here. The acrobatics come crazy fast as he enlists the help of a very reluctant holy man. But its Miss Duan (Qi Shu, The Transporter, 2002) who takes the monster out, with her martial arts skills and weapon of choice, the Infinite Flying Rings.

Tomboy-like Miss Duan falls in love with Chen, who protests hes on a spiritual quest. She becomes more determined, enlisting the help of her sister and, eventually, The Monkey King, the trickster of Chinese legend played with disarming panache by Bo Huang. (Andy Serkis, meet your soul brother!)

Whether the scene is in daylight or night, the picture is clean, detailed and lush with color. Sound is robust, thundering through speakers during fight scenes with a monster fish or a giant boar, pinging and zinging everywhere with Miss Duans bracelets. Mandarin  with English subtitles  comes through cleanly along with a delightful musical score. The climatic duel featuring The Monkey King is awesome!

Chow usually acts in his films, but because of the complexity of Journey to the West, we see him as the director among the short featurettes  only 12 minutes long in their entirety. Mostly, Chow and his cast and crew try not to crack each other up during filming. But we also get a glimpse of wire-work, green screen sets and stunts in Stunts and Special Effects, Cast & Characters, Director Stephen Chow, The Laughs, Production Design and Choreography.

I won't spoil anything about this masterpiece. You should discover it all for yourself  and, possibly, some kids. (Sad parts are no more disturbing than those found in Bambi or The Lord of the Rings trilogy.) Journey to the West received a 92% rating on Rottentomatoes.com, so that tells you something, too.

If you need a great laugh that will also tug your heartstrings, this is it.   Kay Reynolds",1402704000,25,3569,4.947986577181208

5847188,4,B00DPYH3BM,"Journey to the West is a 16th century Chinese poem about a monk who faces evil demons on his journey to the west.  Immortality and enlightenment are central themes in the poem too.  It seems like that's the perfect recipe for an awesome story.  In fact, Journey to the West has been the source of influence for many other stories, including the much loved Dragon Ball series.  This film is an origin story about that monk I mentioned in the beginning.  Overall, the film was good. A few parts were a little weird, but there was more good parts that outweighed the bad parts.  I felt that there was much more story to tell by the time I reached the end of the movie.  So, I hope there is a sequel, because he hasn't even started his journey to India yet.

5847191,4,B00DPYH3BM,"If youve never experienced a Stephen Chow movie, then you are truly missing out.  Chow has a knack for combining drama with zany comedy while throwing in some nifty martial-arts action alongside.  This might sound like a common combination in todays movie place, but I assure you:  Chows movies take these genres to the next level.  JOURNEY TO THE WEST is his latest release, and while I didn't enjoy it as much as I have his previous films, its still a heck of a good time and worth checking out.

Some reviewers have called Chow visionary, and I can see why.  His directing technique is definitely unique, and the way he tells stories is visceral compared to many.  But he is also an acquired taste; some viewers will not like his over-the-top style.

JOURNEY TO THE WEST is shot well and has the same flamboyant flare as Chows previous films.  Visually, the movie is a feast for the eyes; Chow likes to use CG for backdrops and even showpieces, and as a result, the audience gets an aesthetic overload.  This movie does not disappoint at all in this aspect.

The acting is a bit below par for what I would expect from a Chow-caliber movie.  There were really no performances that stood out, and a couple of the characters were even a bit annoying (The Monkey King, in particular). This could be in part due to the horrible dub-over that was used for the English version.  Ive heard some bad ones in my time, but wowthis was one of the worst.  I would recommend watching this film in its native language.

The special effects are good for the most part, however I feel I have to voice my displeasure of The Monkey King once again, but this time about his make-up.  Ive seen Halloween masks that look more realistic.  Im not sure if this was intentional or not, but it didn't work for me.

Still, with those complaints aside, JOURNEY TO THE WEST is a fun film, and fans of Chows work should be pleased.  I liked it for the most part, and I recommend giving it a look so as to decide for yourself.  This is definitely one of those films that will prompt conversation afterwards, so make sure you come back here and let us know what you think after you watch it.  The film is available now in a variety of formats.",1401753600,8,2213,4.4148148148148145

There are issues about self knowledge, naivety, loss of innocence and the journey to understanding that one must go through.  Remember the Monkey King is an important figure in the novel so pay attention when he shows up.  Great comic scenes.

5847194,5,B00DPYH3BM,I admit i've been a Stephen Chow Fan for a long time and it definitely helps to know some of the comedic style and cultural references to the famous Journey to the West mythology that has been retold and remade so many times. And there are so many refreshing angles that Chow took that were pleasantly unexpected. I hesitated to invest time and money on one of Chow's not starring films!? Get out of here! Can't be good right? Wrong. His presence is so strongly felt even without his screen presence. The story just breezed by without any lulls and I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. For the non Chow initiated film collector looking for a audio visual feast you won't be disappointed with top notch graphics and action. The genius of his story telling and comedy is understandable to a wide audience. Example. His first scene there is an intense water battle which becomes a see saw balancing act (a visual reference we can all appreciate from our childhood) I can't wait to show this one to others. And maybe watch it in English next time. I watched in the original language with subs and I don't speak the dialect.,1401235200,2,1126,4.5245098039215685

Comically inept, Xuan Zang cant seem to dispatch the demons and is constantly rescued by a more experienced demon huntress.

The movie is picturesque and moves episodically from one set piece to the next, allowing for a freewheeling, adventurous tone. Several colorful supporting characters are introduced only to be gruesomely slaughtered by demons soon after. With elaborately staged stunts, slapstick inspired by silent Hollywood, downright silliness, and even a dash of black humor, director Stephen Chow has fashioned a wild ride of a movie  one that pulls out all the stops to not only entertain, but dazzle.

5847220,4,B00DPYH3BM,"First let me say to anyone familiar with the story ""Journey to the West,"" this film isn't really that story.  This is a sort-of prequel, taking place long after the Buddha imprisoned the Monkey King, and right before the Monkey King joins a young monk on his titular journey.  The film is actually an origin story for the monk, which I didn't figure out until the very end.  So please don't go into this movie expecting re-enactments of your favorite episodes from the original story.

The movie retains a lot of the wackiness that makes Stephen Chow's films enjoyable, even if he is absent from in front of the camera this time.  Many of the scenes are played out like live-action cartoons, but the tone can very quickly (and shockingly) take an evil, horrible turn.  Be warned: there are a couple of scenes that would never make it into an American-made movie, and that might actually be frightening to children.  One scene that especially comes to mind is a young girl swimming in a river at the beginning of the film.  Also be aware that this is not your father's Monkey King: Sun Wukong is very much a monster and a villain in this movie.  That might shock some people because he is usually portrayed as a mischievous, but ultimately heroic figure.  However, how the Monkey King acts here makes sense in the context of the film.  More than that I won't say, because I don't want to give out any spoilers.

Also what makes this film so very enjoyable for me is the presence of the gorgeous Shu Qi.  She is typically cast as the romantic interest or femme fatale, but this time she gets to show her action and comedy chops, and it appears that she is having a ball doing so.  Many Western film fans only know her from her appearance in the first '""Transporter"" film, and the common complaint there was that her English was not very good  and her acting appeared wooden.  Well, I'm here to say she's a much better actress than that movie would lead you to believe, so give her another chance.

The only reason I'm not giving this movie five stars is because of the jarring shifts in tone.  The last 15 minutes of the film, especially, feels like it's straight from a monster/horror movie.  This is not a great Stephen Chow film (""Shaolin Soccer,"" ""Kung Fu Hustle""), merely a good Stephen Chow film.",1395187200,10,2300,4.52542372881356

5847224,4,B00DPYH3BM,"Stephen Chow's work is energetic, quirky, funny, and composes emotional stories that resonate with the audience.  If you like a lot of chop suey kung fuey, this is a good pick.  If you want an entertaining 2 hours, this is a good pick.  If you want a well paced, action packed artistically rendered CG fest, this is your pick.  If you want a good date night movie (probably not a first date) this is your pick.  As an aside, If you really like deformed feet, this is also your pick.  Enjoy.",1394928000,2,490,4.329670329670329

5847228,5,B00DPYH3BM,"If you loved Kung Fu Hustle, and enjoyed Shaolin Soccer, you will love this. It's what I call a ""sneaky romantic comedy"" - none of the ham-fisted, heartstring pulling that Hollywood is so fond of, but touching and heartfelt all the same. Plus, the action sequences, CGI, and ass-kickery are top-notch. You won't be disappointed.",1394323200,31,328,4.9818181818181815
5847229,4,B00DPYH3BM,I would recommend this to anyone who has seen and liked Kung Fu Hustle. Lots of funny moments and memorable set pieces. Stay away if you're not into films with subtitles.,1394323200,4,170,4.516129032258065
