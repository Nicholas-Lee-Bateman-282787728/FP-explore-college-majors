8660954,5,B00KRAXFJQ,"A beautiful film and perhaps one of the best I've seen from the limited lexicon of the WW1 genre. If you expect gritty trench warfare drama, look elsewhere because the tragedy of war plays out here between two unlikely lovers in a stark Norman farmhouse. Rachel Ward as director eclipses her career as actress. Brava! I will certainly be watching this film again.",1533340800,,363,4.777777777777778

8660962,5,B00KRAXFJQ,"This movie is not a typical WWI war movie, it is about a romance set during the last days of the war. My friend and I were not expecting this. But we  both thought it was well done. I have watched it several times since and enjoyed each time. On short, it is the story of a French woman and an Australian deserter whom she hides . What more watch the movie.",1430697600,4,357,3.9583333333333335
