7094210,5,B00VM5HQCC,Seacon Season of a great TV series made by Sundance. I watched the first season and then the second and look forward to the third,1439942400,2,129,4.2
7094211,5,B00VM5HQCC,"Awesome, wonderful, the most moving and compelling television series I have ever seen. The acting is extraordinary. Five stars is hardly enough.",1439424000,2,144,5.590909090909091
7094212,5,B00VM5HQCC,Loved this series.  Well written and the actors are awesome,1439251200,2,59,4.9

7094214,5,B00VM5HQCC,Great product - great service,1438732800,,29,5.0
7094215,4,B00VM5HQCC,"After I watched season one on Amazon Prime I became addicted and needed to catch up to season 3 that is now playing on Sundance. Not as exciting as Breaking Bad, but a great plot that makes you think.",1438214400,,200,4.153846153846154
7094216,3,B00VM5HQCC,"It's OK, not anything to make me want to watch another season.  Actually, if I'm honest, I found it a little annoying.  That being said, you do get to see some of the poor decision making that likely led to the main character's original incarceration and will likely continue to lead him into trouble. I find the step-brother story line odd.  It just doesn't seem to fit and it pulls me away from the story.",1438214400,,407,4.4
7094217,5,B00VM5HQCC,"This compelling drama is like a good book that is hard to put down. As the story unfolds (albeit a little slowly at times) it develops the characters in such a way that you can feel that you are getting to know them, or at least their little quirks. In addition, this show has an underlying suspense element that is slowly building throughout. I am now 'patiently' waiting for the next DVD release, at which time I plan to revisit the first two seasons again. Believe me, if you enjoyed the first season, season 2 is a must see, and certifiably unique!",1437782400,3,552,4.421568627450981
7094218,5,B00VM5HQCC,"The character development, the nuance, the ambiguity.  So unexpected.  Daniel is such an enigma and it just gets better and better.  I can't wait for the new season to start tomorrow.",1436313600,7,183,4.838709677419355
7094219,5,B00VM5HQCC,I have to admit I love the series. It has poignant moments but also small joyful ones.,1435968000,6,86,4.117647058823529
7094220,5,B00VM5HQCC,Also own Season 1 and 3.  Waiting for S4 to be released.  A must see drama that will turn you into a devoted fan of Rectify,1482019200,,123,3.6923076923076925
7094221,5,B00VM5HQCC,"Season 2 of the best show ever. Somehow it manages to be both gritty and surpassingly poetic. Aden Young, in the leading role of Daniel Holden, delivers a captivating performance that will make you a believer in the resiliancy of the human spirit, even as it breaks your heart.

Kudos to the rest of the gifted, pitch perfect cast and to Rectify's visionary creator Ray McKinnon. Don't miss this one. It's magic!",1477612800,,412,4.722222222222222

7094226,5,B00VM5HQCC,This series is very compelling. There is not a lot of action but rather impressive character studies.,1461369600,,101,5.0
7094227,5,B00VM5HQCC,"like season one it is very moving and can be difficult to watch, but the exchanges of dialog between characters is awesome.  There is a dream like sequence of the character Daniel and his former cell buddy on death row that is worth the entire series. The writers and actors deserve awards for this one.  We loved it.",1454544000,2,317,4.448275862068965

7094236,5,B00VM5HQCC,"This season focuses more on Daniel's family than on him, but it also highlights the fact that all the other actors in Rectify are just as stellar as Aiden Young.  I was surprised that the producer of the show was the actor who played the Reverend in Deadwood.  My only complaint is the lack of bonus features.  Having the producer and writers just doing episode summaries is a waste.  A great second season of the best TV show most folks haven't even heard of.",1442793600,4,460,4.440476190476191
7094237,4,B00VM5HQCC,A very good and different series. Lot of flawed characters in addition to the lead character. Glad it is not shot in LA. Location in Georgia adds realism to the happenings.,1442188800,3,172,4.580645161290323

8710524,5,B00VM5HQCC,"A well constructed, acted and produced series.  Recommend it in the same genre as THE OUTLANDER, THE VIKINGS...
Excellent depiction of how the fragility of the human heart/spirit is with isolation and persecution ongoing.
And the struggle to regain and restore to a socialized/civilized and healthy condition...which is NOT A GIVEN!",1533168000,,332,5.509803921568627
