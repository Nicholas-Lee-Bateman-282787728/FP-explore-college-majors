2509395,5,B000E8JNS8,I have been a Hockey MOM for over ten years. this is a exciting view on the goal tenders! GO Stars!!!,1175040000,4,101,3.857142857142857
2509396,5,B000E8JNS8,Awesome for both parents & kids to watch - for hockey fans.  Great dvd!  Our 8 yr old son loves it.,1168387200,,99,3.6666666666666665
2509397,5,B000E8JNS8,"we cant get much hockey coverage in the UK, [few hours a week if we are lucky] so DVd's like this are really great",1167955200,,114,3.7916666666666665
2509398,3,B000E8JNS8,"This is a great video to have, every NHL fan should go out and order it. It features in-depth stories on the great goalies of today such as Roy, Hasek, Brodeur, and Joseph. It also talks a bit about Billy Smith, Jacques Plante, Bernie Parent, and other goalies of yesteryear. The one major problem with the video is that it was too short, only about fifty minutes, and dedicated a lot of time to the goalies' personal lives instead of saves.",970617600,25,441,4.45679012345679
2509399,5,B000E8JNS8,"This is probably the best hockey video I have ever seen. As a goalie fan, it had obvious appeal. There are great shots of everything goalie, plus a ton of great one-on-one interviews and conversations. My favourite is the  on-ice audio that has Marty Brodeur cracking jokes.",962064000,9,274,4.829787234042553
8107093,5,B000E8JNS8,great dvd,1442793600,,9,4.0
8107094,2,B000E8JNS8,Way too short. Left my 11 yr old wanting more.,1432598400,,46,3.7
8107095,5,B000E8JNS8,"This has always been one of my favorite NHL docs. Ive had the VHS for many many years, but haven't had a VCR for quite a while. I was cleaning out some junk boxes the other day and found the video. I remembered how good it was so I went on Amazon and found the DVD version. Now I can enjoy it for many more years (until they come out with another format which makes DVD's and blu-rays obsolete as well). I am biased, but it's a fact anyways, Dominik Hasek is the greatest goalie ever. End of story. Buy this DVD if you are an NHL fan. Its a good fun watch and the Dominator is in it.",1411084800,,583,3.907563025210084
8107096,5,B000E8JNS8,Great for hockey lovers of all kinds but goalies will love it. Purchased for my son,1407888000,,83,4.25
8107097,5,B000E8JNS8,My son is a young goalie and has this movie memorized. He likes that it taught him about some goalies that aren't playing anymore and a few that still are. The only thing I would say is they need to do an updated version so I can take a break from this one!,1337558400,,257,3.8679245283018866
8107098,5,B000E8JNS8,Gave this to a friend who is a Ice and Roller Hockey Goalie.  He loved it.  Lots if little tidbits about the quirks of each goalie they talked about.,1264464000,,149,4.103448275862069
8107099,4,B000E8JNS8,"I bought this for my son, who became a goalie because of Roy. While we miss seing him play live, this video is the next-best thing.",1249084800,,131,4.076923076923077
8107100,1,B000E8JNS8,"Very poor summary of NHL's best goalies.

Most of the video clips were of the crowd.

Don't waste your money on this DVD.",1210118400,3,121,4.217391304347826
8107101,4,B000E8JNS8,"This is pretty good for a DVD.  Not too long.  Covers several masked men, though not current.  Probably all before 1995.  It is worth it.",1192924800,3,137,4.36
8107102,5,B000E8JNS8,"I've been waiting for this DVD for a long time.  My old VHS copy is almost worn out!

Being a goalie myself I'm a little biased, but it doesn't get better than this.  The goalies they chose at the time are perfect, and it's even cool to see how they've progressed over the years.  I also think that it has just the right amount of action and back story for each goaltender.

All in all a great buy, and if you love hockey you can't go wrong.  I watch before all my games to get pumped up!",1175644800,,488,3.979381443298969
