2727124,5,B000M8Y2WM,"I have also been waiting for ""The Nanny"", seasons three and four. I no longer believe that Sony is going to release them. They did the same thing with ""Mad Abuout you"". They released the first two or three seasons then decided they weren't selling and stopped. I hope that i am wrong but I'm just saying its happened before.",1205107200,2,324,4.416666666666667
2727125,5,B000M8Y2WM,"In the meantime, I got married, and have been for ages.  I have cousins and nieces that came in this world and have now been for quite some time...  I wonder if I really have to be a ""Yetta"" before I get the whole series together....

I have found website tvdvdworld.tv that sells the entire series.  Do you think it is a hoax/fake website?  It all looks so professional?

I have been waiting and waiting and waiting, but all I can see is ""currently unavailable"".  WHEN?? WHEN?? WHEN???

I am also trying to get my hands some other things from this series, but..... :-(

HOW LONG MUST WE WAIT?",1204502400,2,593,4.36697247706422

I would be very thankful!",1199404800,8,153,3.967741935483871
2727127,5,B000M8Y2WM,"Wow! Like everyone else, I am waiting too. I just wonder why Sony chooses to tease us with artwork, but no product. Is it for legal reasons? Are they trying to get releases from guest stars? Are some guest stars holding up the process? Can hardly wait...as we all know this is an awesome series, now way overdue on DVD.",1197676800,6,319,4.333333333333333

2727130,5,B000M8Y2WM,"My family loves The Nanny, and we check weekly for Season 3 and 4 (whose covers have been online forever).  With other things being released, I can't believe that Sony is keeping us waiting so long when clearly the plan is to release them.  We thought - ""Okay, they're waiting for Fall (last year)"", then, ""Okay, they're waiting for Christmas,"" then, ""Okay, they're waiting for summer"". . . .Okay, we've been wrong!  We give up! So when, already?",1184284800,82,446,4.6923076923076925
2727131,5,B000M8Y2WM,I really want to get the final 3 seasons.  I love this show and just recently watched seasons 1 thru 3 again.  It's so funny and romantic.  I can't wait for them to release the rest!  Please hurry up!!!,1391644800,2,202,4.102564102564102

Get a move on SONY!",1383004800,5,287,3.7049180327868854
2727134,5,B000M8Y2WM,"I love the series: ""The Nanny.""

I know I'm not alone -- it makes me laugh, and cheers me up when I'm blue. Sometimes it even makes me cry -- a little -- before it cheers me up.

But, Sony, take some friendly advice: if you don't release seasons 4-6 BEFORE I die, I'm not gonna buy them.",1380067200,3,287,3.9310344827586206

If I bring that many discs into my house they will be destroyed by the kids, and I am just plain tired of keeping up with all the dvds.

2727137,5,B000M8Y2WM,"The sad story is that one can view the complete 6 seasons abroad and they are not pirated copies either. I was introduced to ""The Nanny"" when on vacation. I do not watch weekly TV, series or otherwise, but being on vacation the family we stayed with introduced us to ""The Nanny"" (the whole 6 seasons). Because the series is available abroad, I am not so sure of the comments of some reviewers in reference to securing the publishing rights holds true. I tried to buy it here in the US but could only get the first three seasons. So, I'm going to pick it up when I next go abroad: I asked my friends to buy the series for me. One thing, though, is that the dialogs were not in English (meanwhile I am on the waiting list here at Amazon for season four). My rating, though, goes to what I've watched so far.",1374364800,4,805,4.2

2727140,5,B000M8Y2WM,It has been several years since the release of season's 1 thru 3. What is the hold up on the rest? I do know that sometimes past cast members will not sign off. I really hope this is not it. The fan's are the one's who kept in on TV and we demand that you bring the other season's out!!!,1356739200,6,287,3.8

2727142,5,B000M8Y2WM,"From the words of a true concerned fan this show has my deepest condolances. What has happened to Sony pictures? They used to be such a great company for releasing great tv shows like this. ""All in the Family"" (which Shout! Factory already finished), ""The Jeffersons"", ""Archie Bunker's Place"", ""Maude"", and this one. Show's like them and this is just dying off. But I write and speak out to anyone who gives the slightest bit of care and ask this: ""Can we make a differenc""? Answer: ""YES we can!!!"" Since Sony Pictures is apparently dumping great classic tv shows like this to the curve let us now reach out to ""Shout! Factory"" who has been the savior of most of Sony's ""abbandon"" tv shows. ""Fantasy Island"", ""All in the Family"", ""Diff'rent Strkes"", etc. Shout! if you are reading this by any chance let me just say that I speak for all of us when I tell you do not give up on any of the shows you have been releasing plus give ""The Nanny"" a chance to be saved by your grace.

2727145,5,B000M8Y2WM,I remember watching this show when I was little with my family. It makes me so sad that I can't get the last season to relive those wonderful memories.,1344729600,2,151,4.241379310344827
2727146,5,B000M8Y2WM,"I love movies, shows, collect them, etc. This show is amazing, I love it. I remember watching the very first episode straight through the end of the series, every single episode cause I LOVE the show. ""The Nanny"" is amazing and I love Fran Drescher, the show itself, everybody in it is wonderful. I am highly dissapointed that Season 4, 5, 6 aren't released yet, that I can't find them ANYWHERE. I want my collection to be completed, I JUST got Seasons 2 and 3 and have had 1 for a while. I need the last seasons because 1) I want my collection to be completed and 2) I LOVE that show.

I wrote directly to several persons at sony by email that they should say me when the next seasons are availaible, or why it need so long to release this seasons. NO ANSWERS!! This is really very nice dealing with the fans. We are the people who watch their soaps and by the DVD's and the reaction of sony is ZERO. Shame on you Sony.

Quite frankly, I'm tired of checking back all the time--although I will never give up.  It doesn't make sense that a show that is in syndication that I can still watch in the wee hours of the morning has apparently stopped production of the entire series mid-way.",1299110400,8,408,4.2727272727272725

2727156,5,B000M8Y2WM,"I'm younger fan of the nanny, and I love to be able to watch Fran whenever I want, but unfortunately Sony seems to be taking it's sweet time releasing the last 3 seasons. I already have the first 3 and I watched them all in a couple days, so I'm very impatient for the next one to come out. At least you can now sign up to be notified when the next ones become available, not that that will ever happen, but just in case. I love Fran, and I wish they would just release these seasons, at this point it makes you wonder what they're doing over a Sony; sitting on their butts watching us all suffer? Fran is the most talented actress that I have seen in my short life so far, and I would just love for this to come out.",1294617600,4,717,3.986111111111111

Hopefully they will change their mind...",1293494400,3,144,5.0
2727158,5,B000M8Y2WM,"[...] <[...]>
 This is in hopes of speedy production. I understand they may have to get the actors to sign saying they can produce the dvds. Guest stars like Sherri Lewis/Lamb Chop have passed away, so Sony would need her daughter or some one from her legal team to sign away the rights of that appearence of Sherri through signing. Some of the actors want top dollar/monitary gain from the dvds sales so this may have to do with the production of the seasons. Sherri Lewis signed rights issue MAY be the hold up!!! I believe she guest starred during SEASON 4!!!!
Email them! Who ever associate replies to your email and reads it can forward your email and hopeful request to the CEO/head boss guy of Sony to help get it rolling! ALL companies are like this! They NEED to hear from EVERYONE!",1291248000,3,791,4.493055555555555
2727159,5,B000M8Y2WM,"Reading all of the review's from the fans sure felt good.  I only hope that Ms. Drescher, as well as the other actors, realizes the fans they had, and currently still have.  I follow their activities in the news and their professional projects as much as I can.  It always makes me smile when I see Nicholle Tom on Criminal Minds or Charles Shaughnessy on CSI. The Nanny had fa-nominal writers and the actors were extraordinary.  I too will be anxiously waiting the moment we can all buy the remaining seasons for our collection and our pleasure.  Be patient everyone, it WILL happen.",1290384000,3,584,4.631067961165049

I'd be happy to setting for just one more. If someone wants to sell me the rights, I'll buy them them reproduce my own. I have no downloaded one illegal documents/show/movie yet.

2727162,5,B000M8Y2WM,"I used to catch these episodes on TV when my cable channels were around (due to a mistake).  After my cable company found out we didn't pay for that many channels, this program got cut off.  Since then, I've had to stock up on Season DVDs which I don't mind.  I only do so on select shows such as The Nanny.  I love the pair:  Fran Drescher and Maxwell Sheffield...LOL, his real name is a bit hard to remember.  The writers sure did have their creative genes when coming up with their character names.  I loved this episdoe when Niles made fun of C.C. Babcock's first names cuz she wouldn't reveal it until the end.  This had to do with Brighton getting a French tutor who hit on both Fran and C.C....and the French tutor said that it stood for ""CaCa""....LOL....That cracked me up.  Ok, so I've said it.  I know how the show ends, so pls....release these videos already.  I'd like to keep them for reviewing purposes.  I shouldn't have bought Season 3 so early then.

Someone needs to look out for the fans!!
I think we got our answer on the wait.  The Nanny has been added to TV Land and they want us to watch it there instead of our own copies.",1279152000,21,451,3.869565217391304

Maybe SONY needs to get those 'sign offs' when the person signs to do the show in the first place as part of them going on the show.
Then they can release them when they want.

I think they feel that the sales didn't go so great so they say 'f-it' and not going to waste their money to put them on DVD.
Now another year has passes.  Season Three ended with a 'to be continued' episode.

2014 is around the corner... 6 years! Come on Sony, whats really going on Sony?",1270684800,3,578,4.133928571428571
2727167,4,B000M8Y2WM,"We are so dependent now on Nickelodeon, which by the way is so disrespectful with The Nanny's fans.
They do not bother repeating the same episode two days in a row! I'm sure Sony does not release the entire
season because of the cast's restrictions. Most of them must still make money with syndication. Anyway, either the actors or Sony could be more considerate with fans!",1268697600,22,373,4.666666666666667
2727168,5,B000M8Y2WM,"The reason there is such a delay for the release of the nanny dvd's is all the ""special"" actors/actresses that are on the final 3 dvds have to sign off on them first.

contract negotiations drag on forever because the ""special"" people want to get as much as they can monetarily. Sony cannot release the dvd's until ALL the contracts have been negotiated and signed off on.

...and if any ""actors/Actresses"" have died since the show aired, then the attorneys for those people try to get monies for their estates.

..and we all know how long that crap will take...

So i say, be patient, and watch Big Bang Theory, or family guy or whatever else good is out there until they get around to releasing the DVD's (and this is the same reason Sony stopped releasing other shows, they cant get the contracts ok'd)

hope this helps,

These seasons are just waiting in your vault without making ANY MONEY!!! Why wait 2 years between each release? Why are you trying to do? Wait until every one in the world forgets about the Nanny series and then release them so nobody will buy them? (Present ever-faithful cyber-company excluded of course!)

RELEASE ALL OF THE SEASONS ALREADY AND CUT THIS 2-YEAR WAIT TIME CRAP!!!

We want the rest of the seasons, no we need them, we have to have them.  This is a great show.  I recently purchased seasons 1, 2 and 3 and have not stopped watching it.  I've forgotten just how hilarious The Nanny is.  So how bout it?  Can we have the next three seasons please.",1250208000,17,394,4.092105263157895

I've seen like every single episode on Nick and Night like every night cuz they play like 6 episodes a night
but sometimes their not in order...
But i want them all on DVD so i can watch the whole show in order from beginning to end with no commercials
Maybe one of these days I'll win the lottery and I'll buy the rights to the shows so they can be finally released.
It needs a box set.
Oh have I mentioned that I like this show?

2727180,5,B000M8Y2WM,This is one of my favorite seasons of The Nanny. Thanks to Crywishes's channel I can watch every episode of The Nanny on Youtube. I already know every episode from season 4 thanks to his or her's channel. The show is so funny and I can watch it over and over. How can anyone hate this show? Watch it on Youtube and on Nick at Nite. I love you Fran.,1250121600,4,348,3.9857142857142858

Entered my computer and found 3 different places which are selling ALL 6 SEASONS in 4 cases, advertising them as 146 Episodes on 13 dvd discs plus THE NANNY REUNION as a bonus.
However, I have a strong suspicion that these are burnt copies, or asian imports. Is there any reason why SONY is not offering all six sets so customers interested in them can purchase them legally? Practically all TV Comedies have come out with all separate COMPLETE Seasons, making them available to all collectors. Shame on SONY for holding back.",1242864000,21,634,4.7727272727272725

2727188,5,B000M8Y2WM,"I too have been waiting and waiting for The Nanny and for Sony to release the rest of the seasons.  This is one of the best sitcoms aside from Frazer that I truly enjoy.  SONY please release the rest of the series.  There are many of us that enjoy her.  For those that wanted to know about ordering the episodes from somewhere else (they are located in Canada), I personally ordered what they claimed to be 13 disks with all the episodes.  When they came I recieved 17 disks, many were duplicates of disks, seasons missing AND they were copied off the TV Land television station with poor resolution.  When contacting them, in their defense, they did give me a credit for those episodes that were missing, but could not replace them for the correct episodes. I just wish that SONY would get their act together so we don't have to resort paying good money to another company in another country to recieve junk.  Sony would have profited 10 fold if they had just put them out there for us to purchase.",1235520000,7,999,4.456043956043956

Created and executive produced by Fran Drescher and her now ex-husband(Peter Marc Jacobson), The Nanny took much of its inspiration from Drescher's personal life growing up in Queens, NY involving names and characteristics based on her relatives and friends, but unfortunately THE NANNY's 1st Season didn't start out with very good ratings and the ratings didn't improve till it hit its 2nd Season in the Fall of 1994.
