The highest value terrorist target is to nuke the joint session of Congress when the President is addressing them.  With this knowledge, the government has taken actions to prevent this and to mitigate the consequences if it were to happen. Good to see they are protecting against terrorist instead of just spying on Americans.",1392508800,2,394,5.15625
4232894,1,B003Z88IRQ,Sorry - this is a typical sensationalized overproduced production that offers no real information or value other than striking graphics with dramatic voice over - talking heads with very little real authority or substance - what if - what if - it's the same as Ancient Alien Whatever or Book of Secrets - History Channel used to be be Great but somewhere they went wrong with this type of show that basically says nothing with lots of drama - and lots of build up and cut to commercial - then re-hash with graphics and dramatic voice over and nothing substantial - watch it if you're bored and are already sick of SharkNado or that Detroit Pawn Shop show where those two spoiled brats constantly argue with each other over whose the biggest spoiled brat,1373846400,5,753,4.626865671641791
4232895,5,B003Z88IRQ,"This documentary is both scary and interesting.  It shows what could happen if a nuclear bomb were detonated in the Washington DC area.  While such an event would have seemed farfetched at one time, with terrorism and nuclear knowledge both spreading, it is not beyond the realm of possibilities.

Day After Disaster initially shows using CGI how the blast would destroy building, monuments, and kill many people.  Those close to the blast site would die almost immediately. As you move further away people would see a flash, then the blast wave would hit a couple seconds later.
The documentary explains how the government would react to such an event. Top priority would to maintain a functioning government and protect the president and other top people. There is a ready-to-go plan in place (called COG: Continuity of Government) which was activated once before - on September 11, 2001. Then local first responders would be needed to help with search and rescue.

There is also information about what you should do if you survived a nuclear attack. In general stay out of open areas where the radiation would be greatest.  Staying in confined spaces is best for at least several days.  But even being in a car vs. out in the open may help. Nevertheless, radiation would likely kill many people long afterwards as its effects took their toll on peoples' bodies.

Hopefully the events portrayed in Day After Disaster will never happen. But I wouldn't be surprised if a similar event happened somewhere in the world.  It shows how a nuclear device can be hidden in a suitcase, and offers the chilling possibility that some group could have more than one, and use them to terrorize the whole country.  This documentary probably isn't suitable for young children, but I think most adults would find it worth seeing just in case such an event happens one day.",1368576000,7,1857,4.866666666666666
