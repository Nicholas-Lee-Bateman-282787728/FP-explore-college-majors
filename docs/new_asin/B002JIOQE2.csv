Paul cook  ponds out the beats like he always has and seams to be about the same as always just with a little more fashion style of their custom designers. to see thm you might laugh too muchbut to hear them they are possibly better than ever!-if not they sound pretty  great still!",1412208000,,1391,4.301526717557252
