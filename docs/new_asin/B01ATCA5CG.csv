7609835,5,B01ATCA5CG,"This is a story that many of us can relate to...it is a reminder that mental illness touches many of our families. We are not alone.  This powerful screenplay is beautifully acted, and will stick with you long after the film credits are over. Watch it and share it!",1459036800,3,265,4.408163265306122

7609837,5,B01ATCA5CG,"This was a powerful movie, very personal for my husband and me. Good screenplay and acting. Based on a true story, it accurately depicts the heartbreaking and common realities of families whose child struggles with a serious brain illness. We're still in the dark ages when it comes to understanding that bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, major depression, etc. are medical illnesses. Until we bring them out of the shadows and into the same realm as cancer, heart disease and other chronic illness victims will suffer from discrimination and families will suffer in isolation without a community of support. It is the loneliest place in the world--I know because I've been there. Please watch, and spread the word about it. End the silence.",1458950400,30,740,5.12396694214876
7609838,5,B01ATCA5CG,"This is an urgently needed film that everyone needs to see. It so acutely and accurately describes the emotions and stress of a family living with a member having a serious mental illness and how they learn to cope. This film is at times charming and yet also heart breaking. The very talented cast of primarily unknown young actors exhibit the necessary range of emoting that allows the viewer to understand what it means to have a child suffering with bipolar disease. This film is as close to a reality show as it could be and offers us a slice of life that no one wants and yet all too many must bear.
PLEASE SEE THIS IMPORTANT FILM!",1458950400,8,637,4.406779661016949
7609839,5,B01ATCA5CG,"""NO LETTING GO""  A very powerful movie. Very well directed. Perfectly cast with that cast providing excellent performances. A very good screenplay. Very good technical aspects. Some very intense scenes done very realistically. A very good movie that I do recommend.",1458950400,3,265,5.463414634146342
7609840,5,B01ATCA5CG,This movie is very moving. It tells the truth what someone goes through with a mental problem. Sad movie too. But worth watching.,1518998400,,129,4.6521739130434785
7609841,5,B01ATCA5CG,"This is a remarkable movie to the extent as a true life portrayal, it was almost the equal of a live witness.  The Producer had the genius to present a very clear reality how irrational in content mental illness can be in life.  In my personal and professional life until retirement, I had to deal with such incidents in households and refer those families to experts.  It is incredible how Noah Silverman, Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick and the other youths in the cast were capable and even precocious to act out the roles of mentally ill youths and the effect on peers around them.  I have viewed this production several times and it is magnificent to enable the viewer to comprehend only parents and a few adults are not capable to manage such
mental illness as the bi-polar disorders that requires deferral to the professionals.  This is a five-star production of real life crisis and very, very well done.  It is a myth that the sins of the Fathers are visited to the third and fourth generations, especially mental illnesses that can strike anyone at any time.",1518048000,,1061,4.708108108108108
7609842,5,B01ATCA5CG,"Very moving movie.  Emotions from sad, hurting for the family, to laughter.  The feelings of hopelessness for people that go through this is so sad.  Trying to understand, and having the patients to continue on takes a great deal of love and hope.",1516579200,,247,4.6976744186046515
7609843,5,B01ATCA5CG,"This movie really shows the reality of living with a mental health illness. I was really surprised how the author present this movie. I liked how it shows the school didn't notice anything on him ,how the school fail to have the proper education for him, how friends react , the parents feelings, how stress can bring another diseases like cancer, how can a right treatment can help, medication is not only the solution etc... I really love this movie, it made me cries so many times.",1515196800,,484,4.574712643678161
7609844,5,B01ATCA5CG,"This is a beautifully produced film about a family's experience with childhood anxiety and depression. It touches on so many important nuances that only a family who has lived it will understand: judgment from other families, the effect on siblings/ marriage, the helpless feelings of parents, school refusal,  med trials, etc...  Bravo to the everyone involved in making this film.",1514678400,,382,5.35

7609847,5,B01ATCA5CG,"No Letting Go is such a wake-up call for parents of children that have mental illnesses. I am so happy that there are movies such as this to bring youths and parents hope. There was not so much help for my generation. Parents be open to the real message in this, never give up in seeking help and be open to programs as was presented here.",1512172800,,339,4.151515151515151

7609849,5,B01ATCA5CG,"I often feel so isolated as a single mother with two children who struggle with mental and emotional disorders. The first half of this movie was so much like the daily struggle with my son. (I didn't even realize that his refusal to get out of bed was a part of it all.) As my son is only 7 years old, the latter half of this movie is something I have not had to face, but have thought very much about.

It's hard to deal with everything. It's hard to watch it on the screen. But I could identify with so many details of this movie that it helps me remember that I'm not alone. There is hope. We can get through this.",1511136000,,617,4.016260162601626
7609850,5,B01ATCA5CG,"Powerful movie. So many areas I could relate to personally. We need more discussion around mental health, especially for our children.",1508889600,2,134,5.428571428571429
7609851,4,B01ATCA5CG,"SPOILER ALERT!! Good movie with very realistic family dynamics. The treatment facility at the end of the movie seemed to be the start of Tim's healing but I would say it's unfortunate that most families can't pay ""6 figures"" a year to have their child treated. That being said, I'm glad Tim's family can afford it and it is working out for them.",1503964800,2,345,4.492063492063492

7609853,5,B01ATCA5CG,"For someone who has a family history of Bipolar, this movie is a wonderful reminder of healing that can come with treatment! I think this should be required viewing to have compassion and healing for all involved!",1499731200,2,213,4.783783783783784
7609854,5,B01ATCA5CG,"If you have no people in your world with any mental health challenges, it may be hard to comprehend.  My 10 yr old son watched this, on a weekend home from his residential treatment placement, with rapt attention.  He was comforted to see that there are other kids out there who go through what he goes through.  And that success can be found in residential placement.  What resonated for me is that when someone has Cancer, they get casseroles, balloons and flowers.  When someone has a mental health disorder, people shy away, say ""ooo that's scary"", and stop calling.  What I hope people know is that mental health IS physical health, and just like you get glasses if you can't see, you get medication and therapy to help you function with a mental health disorder.  This movie helps get that message across well.  Thank you for this.",1497398400,9,837,4.64625850340136

7609856,5,B01ATCA5CG,"I am bipolar and have been all my life.  I have been on medication for about 14 years.  I had no health insurance when I realized I had to get help so couldn't be treated. I have lost my family because of the bipolar.  I am on medication and doing much better but I am alone now and my family wants nothing to do with me.  So, everyday for almost 20 years has been my punishment with no end in sight.  They will never trust me again and have made it very clear how they feel and to not have any contact with them.  For this reason it's hard to fight depression even with the meds.  Bipolar is a horrible mental health issue.  Most certainly I didn't ask to be this way and everyday is a challenge to keep my faith.  So far my prayers have been unanswered.  This movie brought back many memories of my own childhood.  This young man played his roll in this movie to perfection.  I cried most of the way through it because of all the pain it brought to everyone involved.  A great movie to better understand the life and torment of bipolar.",1495324800,9,1038,4.155778894472362
7609857,5,B01ATCA5CG,"A little corny, but as a behavioral health professional I think this captures the emotions of a family who love someone with a mental illness. High five producers!",1494979200,2,163,4.857142857142857
7609858,5,B01ATCA5CG,"I think people who say this story takes to long to develop and reveal the issue missed the point of this movie. This movie displays the struggle parents face when you have a child that no one understands. It typically takes avout 10 years to get a proper diagnosis in the mean time parents feel isolated and alone. Your stuck helpless as you try to help your child cope with an illness you don't understand. Clearly this movie isn't meant for just regular entertainment. It highlights a major problem, 1 and 5 children have a Mental Health diagnosis. For being such a big problem there's very little support. Besides everyone's concern for the acting this movie is a perfect conversation facilitator for what is a very crucial discussion. I highly recommend this movie to parents, family and friends of a child with behavioral or emotional disorders and/or professionals within the helping field.
So clearly this is not a hollywood video but is doesn't have to be. It accomplished it's goal of raising awareness to a very serious issue that affects millions of americans.",1494374400,,1071,4.85792349726776
7609859,5,B01ATCA5CG,This movie was so true to what it is like to raise a child with bipolar.  It will truly open the eyes to those that don't know the struggle.,1492041600,2,140,3.8275862068965516

7609864,5,B01ATCA5CG,"As a mental health provider who has worked with teens and families, I can attests that this is a very accurate portrayal of mental illness and how it can affect families.  While heartbreaking and raw, it gives hope.  Hope that there is help and that there are people who understand.  It's a must see both for families and providers.  I am grateful to the family who shared their story with us -- it is truly a gift.",1486339200,3,415,4.35064935064935

7609872,5,B01ATCA5CG,"So glad my professor told my class and I to go and see this film. It hit home very well, having a son with a disability is sometimes very hard and you are worried that you will be talked about and judged. Well let me tell you that you are NOT ALONE, we must stand united and create awareness so that the world can know that there is help and please ask for it.

7609874,5,B01ATCA5CG,No Letting Go accurately and poignantly shares a family's journey through the diagnosis and treatment of a child's mental illness.

7609876,3,B01ATCA5CG,I really wanted to like this movie.  Going in that I was hoping for answers.  There are no answers.

7609879,4,B01ATCA5CG,"Very heart wrenching but good at the same time. Showed how depression effects everyone in the family but how everyone can help.

My favorite quote was by the therapist:
She said he is not depressed/bipolar  that is not who he is it, it is what he has. Sorry if i misquoted watched a bit ago. But there are so many labels we put on  kids. But she was relaying to his family that his mental condition did not define him it was just a part of him.

7609889,5,B01ATCA5CG,"""No Letting Go"" is a moving and authentic-feeling story of the chaos caused to a child and his family by the child's mental illness.  It would have been easier on everyone, it seems, had the child had a terminal physical illness.  At least the beleaguered parents wouldn't have been assumed to have caused the problem by their child-rearing practices.  But that's not how mental illness works.  It's real, endlessly perplexing, and often devastating to everyone involved.",1483920000,,471,5.157894736842105

7609921,4,B01ATCA5CG,Although I think bipolar disorder is the kale and Pilates of everyone's psychological vocabulary these days...you never hear even doctors so much throwing that diagnosis at children or even considering it as a cause for their behavior. This movie gave a new perspective and something to think about...not sure what to make of the side of breast cancer to the plot. Very heart felt .

7609938,3,B01ATCA5CG,"This movie illustrates important subject matter to be sure. Family's resources and life style depicted in this story are unfathomable to most Americans. Bipolar disorder is as diverse as one person is to another, although there are basic similarities. In this country and most others, those suffering from any form of mental illness, especially noticeable bipolar, are extremely frightening to family members and the general public. This is worth watching to begin to comprehend the severity of the unseen and the many repercussions that follow. Bronson, a British film based on a true story like No Letting Go, is much more realistic and displays the brutality of care still given today to the rank and file, give or take, depending (here in America) what state you live in, type of insurance you are able to afford, and most importantly, someone who will never give up on their unfortunate loved one that is so afflicted.",1476316800,9,923,5.0

This film is exactly my family's life, and it is heart breaking. The thing with childhood bipolar is that the one person closest to the child, the person that child feels safest with, usually the mom, gets THE WORST of everything-the screaming, the tears, the emotional abuse, and sometimes the violence. And that thing with the siblings--spot on. Also, people out in public don't understand what they are seeing when my kid has a meltdown. I have been threatened more than once by people that think I am abusing my child (why else would the child be screaming, kicking and refusing to get into the car, right?). They have no way of knowing that I invoked this explosion by refusing to buy my kid a can of soda (sugar and caffeine-no good for bipolars!). I have, more than once, had to leave a full shopping cart at the grocery because my kid has had an episode in the aisle. I don't take my child grocery shopping anymore. Sounds like an impossible life, doesn't it? And it is, without my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I pour my heart out to Him and He pours His grace out on me. That is the only way our family functions.

But it was a tough slog for me to stay with it through the entire movie, and this is a subject that I have studied and is very interesting to me. The movie was way too long, for one thing. Too much time was spent on the early childhood and teenage symptoms and behavioral problems. It seemed like the script was written by the parents to justify how hard they tried to solve the problems with their son before they finally realized they were going to have to put him in a residential treatment center. In the beginning it says this is based on a true story. One of the first things I learned in writing class is just because something happened a particular way, that doesn't mean it makes a good story. If you are doing a documentary, stick to the facts - but this is not a documentary, so some creative license is permissible and that, along with a good editing, would have improved the movie greatly.",1470355200,,1101,4.428571428571429

She can't get health care because she can't keep a job and with all the medication she has taken it has compromised her kidneys. She has IBS, cramping and pees about 10 times an hour. Heartburn and stomach issues that we are dealing with. It's not just about the mental but also the physical affects of the medication and long term usage.

True to life story line about the struggles family members and their loved one go through on a daily basis when trying to deal with a mental disorder, in this case bipolar disorder. Trying to verbally describe what it's like is difficult at best and really doesn't even begin to make others understand just what it's really like. The movie just touches on many of the mosts common things that go on in the households with someone suffering from bipolar disorder but it does a good job on portraying the difficulties that arise even though it's not detailed in depth. The stigma is real!!! So many people are afraid to ask for help or even acknowledge to others that they or someone in their home suffers from this terrible brain disorder. More than likely someone you know, maybe a close friend, coworker, neighbor, or a casual acquaintance has a mental disorder or is living with someone with a mental disorder but because of the stigma attached to mental illnesses, they don't share that information.

However, I'm so thankful that it was produced. The portrayal of the mother's response: her confusion, pain, guilt, exhaustion and sadness was accurate and real. Families are rocked by the ongoing and unpredictable nature of mental illness and are often driven into isolation. How many times can you give excuses for your child's/siblings absence or behavior and realize that friends and family do not understand and often draw the wrong conclusions? I appreciated that it also brought to light how difficult it is to find treatment that is effective and affordable, even for those aggressively seeking and resourceful.

If you haven't lived with a person with mental illness, PLEASE watch this film to understand your friend or co-worker who is coping with it.

Is the kid playing with poisonous objects. The body gets sick first and then there is a sudden onset of mental problems. Psychiatrists will not look at the health of the body or any possible illness that caused the mental instability. They will just prescribe medications that just make things worse. Once damage is done by some kind of chemical exposure the damage is usually been done and can't be fixed. The brain will try to stabilize on its own as it adapts to the damage.

A new patient at a treatment facility has to ask permission to go to the bathroom, but he can go out into the woods with his roommate to gather firewood?  If your son has a severe mental illness, you would wake him from a peaceful sleep to tell him you were sending him away?  There were dozens more things that made no sense.

It is not their fault any more than a person with cancer should be blamed for their disease. We should accept the fact that this is common and people, especially children who are reaching puberty and adolescence should be treated with care, not judgement. Mental disease is real and so many families have members needing help not judgement. It is hard to confine a person at a young age, but it is necessary for the safety of the person and the family. Siblings at home suffer in many ways and they also need help in dealing with a brother or sister or parent who needs medical not police treatment. Confining the person makes it possible to isolate the patient and keep them safe. We as families are not able to deal with many of these difficult symptoms.",1468713600,2,1022,4.559782608695652

7610185,2,B01ATCA5CG,"I felt that this film did a good job of spotlighting how mental illness can impact not only a patient but also a family; however, from my understanding, bipolar disorder is typically a cycling of euphoric highs with desperate lows. In males, especially major depression can manifest in anger or rage along with self-hatred and anxiety, which the film spotlighted. But the manic highs of bipolar were not shown here: grandiosity, feeling euphoric, staying up for nights on end, and indulging in dangerous and impulsive behavior.

As another reviewer brought to light, Borderline Personality Disorder seemed to be closer to what the main character seemed to be suffering with. I also found it frustrating that no specific therapy with highlighted to give hope to patients and the families of patients whom struggle with this particular issue.

*On a side note, emerging studies have shown that Bipolar Disorder has been highly over-diagnosed in females, where they actually have either a hormonal imbalance or where they may actually be allergic to their own hormones. Standard testing does not always disclose the imbalance, and unfortunately most insurance companies do not cover the necessary tests.

PLEASE, for patients or families of females diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, invest in the necessary testing, as it could save a lifetime of incorrect treatment.",1468627200,2,1363,5.300925925925926

The one thing that really got me was when they didn't sing the ""Happy Birthday"" song to Charlie, Tim's best friend. I've never been to or heard of a kid's birthday party without singing ""Happy Birthday"". Very out of the ordinary and unamerican. The mother being diagnosed with cancer was very unnecessary. It seems like it was more of a transition for Tim to come home and see his family when in a real life situation, he would've been accepted to see his family regardless of family members' health. The ending was short. I would've like to have heard what Tim had to say on stage. Was he going to perform or simply express his mental illness?",1468195200,,789,4.486111111111111

7610222,2,B01ATCA5CG,"I wanted to like this film.  Mental illness is complex and tricky--and a proper diagnosis even trickier.  It's not like high blood pressure or diabetes; you can't follow an algorithm and expect certain results.  Everyone's brain chemistry is different.  One viewer said that this film was based on a true story, but the film states directly that the story is not based on a real person.  That is probably why the writer is confusing bipolar disorder with borderline personality disorder (BPD).  Yes, one can have both, but in this film the lead character, ""Tim,"" is exhibiting behaviors of BPD and ""acting out"" (anger, stress, irritability, etc.) in the face of overwhelming emotions and not  because of  bipolar disorder.  Tim has emotional dysregulation; he is unable to regulate intense emotions such as fear, anxiety, loss, grief, sadness, and disappointment without acting out; no where in the film did he exhibit the cyclic highs and lows of bipolar disorder.  He doesn't want to go to school because he is scared so he acts out.  He can't keep up with the other kids in the classroom so he acts out.  He misses a goal and feels shame so he acts out.  Underneath all of this is clinical Major Depression.  The stupid games that the first counselor had Tim engage in was not helpful.  He needed dialectical behavioral therapy and probably antidepressants.

People suffering from Bipolar disorder are not 'up and down' many times in a day; they experience highs and lows in cycles.  BPD sufferers can experience several highs and lows in a day because one's behaviors are contingent upon the stability of their emotions.  I remember thinking the only time I saw Tim remotely act ""manic"" was after the doctor put him on meds (he was talking up a storm in the scene by the piano)!  This is to be expected.  Giving a person medication not used to treat his condition definitely would make him act 'weird""!  Overall, this film does a good job of showing the pain a family goes through when a child is suffering from mental illness.  That said, this film was ripe with stereotypes.  The is a lot of stigma over Tim's mental condition: from his own family, ""friends,"" social circle, teachers, etc... This film does an excellent job of addressing that and exposes these shallow people for who they are.  Dad had some classic responses to Tim's behavior.  Had he been around more, perhaps he wouldn't believe Tim could just ""shake it off"" and ""get over it.""

I would have given it 5 stars had they correctly diagnosed Tim.  Wrong diagnosis, wrong treatment plan.  Nevertheless, the highly-structured environment  was still appropriate.  Wouldn't it be great if we all had ""6-figures"" to send our child off to Maine to learn how to regulate their emotions?",1468195200,3,2751,4.8286937901498925

Tim is a ten year old boy who is not coping with anything, until therapy becomes necessary.

He is finally sent away, against his will, to a treatment facility in another state, and nothing is explained about his treatments there.

At his first psychologist's appointment, the psychologist says to Tim, ""I am going to talk to you like you are an adult,""
and a moment later, she asks him, ""Why do you think your mommy brought you here?""

At the very end of the movie, the mother is diagnosed with cancer and has a double mastectomy, which has absolutely nothing to do with the story and has no impact on the story, so it was completely ridiculous and unnecessary to include this in the movie.

7610233,5,B01ATCA5CG,"Everyone should watch this film. Part of the difficulty of caring for a child with mental health issues is that others don't understand what you are going through. They blame the parents, they think they could handle the child better, etc. This film helps others see what it's like from the inside so they can be more compassionate and understanding. If you have a child like this, you will relate to the story. You will catch all the subtle issues that are embedded in the story. You'll see you are not alone and actually, that your experience is actually ""normal"" for this situation This is a rare and excellent film.

7610238,4,B01ATCA5CG,"The research on the mental disorder was well done and the result was a good movie. Honestly, I selected this movie because of Noah Fleiss, but Noah Silverman was a superb actor, perhaps the best of the whole bunch. Some parts of the story had a strange sequence and weirder transition, and the dialogues were very poor and many times nonexistent (indie movie style); acting, with a few exceptions was not great. Surprisingly, the kids were more convincing than the adults.  But the story is very beautiful. If the script and the acting had been better, it would be an excellent plus movie. I would recommend this movie in spite of all the flaws.",1466467200,,645,4.657894736842105

I have experienced the educator side of the challenge and struggle of working with students whose mental illness at times render them literally unable to function in a classroom setting. Even while having great compassion for the child, it still often feels impossible to know the right path to take as each decisions impacts so many people, including the other students in the school. Yet in the midst of the conversations, strategizing, consulting, etc - my heart always aches for the families, knowing their battle is neverending. It doesn't take a break when the school bells ring at the end of the day, or when the school doors close for the summer.
This is the heart wrenching (a beautiful portrayed) story of one such family. This struggle impacts so many lives, I am thankful someone is bringing it to a wider audience.",1459900800,26,850,4.828767123287672

8748397,4,B01ATCA5CG,"I was nervous about watching this movie because not only am I diagnosed with depression, but four of my children are diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and OCD. Each of them has different manifestations of their illness, but one daughter has struggled to survive for the last 5 years. We've left no stone unturned to seek treatment, with small amounts of success, and will probably always be on the journey to better treatment. I was nervous because I didn't want to finish the movie bawling and feeling hopeless, but I also didn't want a cheesy version of what real life is like as a parent watching their child go through this horrendous ordeal. This movie managed to strike a good balance, I believe, between giving hope and showing reality. I wanted to scream at the screen when the teachers or other women would say insensitive things to the mom! I've heard ALL of those lines and more. I try to speak out publicly when I feel the time is right, so that others have at least an opportunity to see inside the reality of living with mental illness. I appreciated this movie very much.",1532131200,,1088,4.642487046632124
8748398,1,B01ATCA5CG,"inept script, inept directing which of course leads to inept acting. Every character in this movie, based on the script and direction, are one dimensional. If a Child is suffering from mental illness, the symptoms are more subtle, more mysterious in its various manifestations. Instead what we get is a child who throws temper tantrums: ""I want to go home; I don't want to be in the play, I don't want this, I don't want to go to school......"" I loved this scene: Father: ""you realize he has missed 38 days of school already""  So the parents get him into an exclusive private school. Yeah right an exclusive private school (usually always have a waiting list) takes in a child with a history of mental issues and high truancy rate. Rent the movie ""10 1/2"", much better movie dealing with this subject. Better yet google Chazz Petrella  and watch the documentary.",1530144000,,862,4.701986754966887

I thank GOD  for his mercy and love  that he has shown me, and in giving me a family that loved me with unconditional love. i especially thank GOD for the mother that raised me. She most definatly  deserves  much credit to her understanding and love and patience.",1525651200,,857,4.51948051948052

The sad part is, I'm thinking, what about families who can't afford special treatment facility. The movie dealt with middle to upper-class family.  So if you can't afford treatment your kid just gets worse and your family suffers more?  Kind of sad that 14 million kids in American have a mental disorder.  I wonder how many of the 14 million can't afford or get help.  Movie did not deal with that issue.",1525564800,,515,4.532608695652174
