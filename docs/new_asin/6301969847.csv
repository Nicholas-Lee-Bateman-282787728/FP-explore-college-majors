389697,4,6301969847,"As like Star Wars, ""older"" movies don't have to be poor. Forced Vengeance is about much raw strength and nice evil characters. Real characters, not the usual martial arts actors of the nineties. It's great. For the story read one of the other reviews.
I want to comment the ""style"". The opening scene, where only Norris Silhouette fights a thug, plus the music, make up a kind of message, like ""The weapon is brutal and hits hard"". Later, the same scene is shown in original speed, while the opening shows it very slow. I prefer the slow, because to see what damage the opponent takes when hit. The first mid of the eighties had this cool hard  style, like Asia mission and this one, while the later half came up with kid-amazing stuff like Karate Kid and Karate Warrior, where a teenie or a van-damme-lookalike learns how to fight. But the other style, like Forced Vengeance, shows no one learning and becoming a super hero. It shows a dude with an iron fist, nothing more or less. So, the fights here are not dozens of minutes but a few hard hits. And to see, how these hits work, give it a brutal flavor. The colors in the movie are sometimes neon lights, sometimes a very hard contrast to blood (like on the boat where Norris fights Raymondy. Some people say, fighting movies are lacking of story, then again, other ones say, it needs more fights, when there's too much dialogue. Forced Vengeance is about 60% dialogue and 40% fights / violence. I would say it is pretty good. Plus Joy is a cutie. Plus it has good music. Plus the letter characters for the cast are really stylish (note that in the making of a film even the fonts have to be chosen). Chuck Norris is not there to make a good movie actor but to hit damn hard, and he does HEHE. If you expect this movie to be filled with nothing than fighting scenes, you will be disappointed. It includes stunt-alike short-fights which are damn great, and the places and characters as well as the storyline would make a made a cool 80'ies film, and today, they would make a perfect action videogame. I pray it will come out on DVD. Including the german dub :-) The last scenes show some fight scene punches and kicks, and again, if you see it, the only thing in your mind will be: ""Woah, ouch! That was a damn hard hit...""",1007856000,3,2276,4.419047619047619
389698,3,6301969847,"Chuck Norris is a debt collector for a small, yet profitable Hong Kong gambling house.  When his employer (and good friend) is assasinated by gang muscle, he goes on the war path, kicking in the teeth of all who get in his way as he hunts down those responsible.
Forced Vengeance is a standard issue action/revenge thriller.  Director James Fargo (The Enforcer, 1976) shows very little growth as a director, although I'll grant that the neon backlit fight scene is an attempt at style that almost works.  Action star Norris was a film or two away from becoming truly comfortable in front of the camera, so his performance is pretty stiff, but he remains a likable presence.  The movie appears to be shot in the widescreen (2:35:1 ratio), so a letterboxed DVD edition would be a nice gift for Norris buffs such as myself.

Later Josh is pursued by the police and anyone who helps is killed, but Josh continues to track down the people who are responsible for the murders.

389770,4,6301969847,"FORCED VENGEANCE is one of Chuck's early 80s missing classics. Chuck Norris plays Josh, the bouncer and strong arm guy for, of all things, an honest Jewish-American casino owner in British Hong Kong (played by David Opatoshu).

When the honest businessman stands up to a Chinese-British syndicate trying to beat him down, he's killed along with almost everyone in his family except his pretty jet-setting daughter whom Chuck is trying to protect.

Chuck is young here. There's lots of excellent martial arts action and some outrageous plot twists, and Chinese people speaking Yiddish, so this is a must-see despite the relatively chintzy production values and Norris' more-than-usually stiff acting.",1348444800,,699,5.4036697247706424

389818,4,6301969847,"1982 was a big year for Chuck Norris. He released two terribly awesome or awesomely terrible movies. One was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Silent-Rage/dp/B00005QVZ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Silent Rage</a>. The other is the reason your pal, Sid the Elf, has ended his Spring hiatus--Forced Vengeance. Also 1982 is the year in which a hairy chest and a blond mullet crested as the sign of masculine virility. What is not a sign of masculine virility, however, is having a tailor-made chance to have a hot fugitive threesome with a buxom blond and a dark beauty and not getting it done. Shame on you, Chuck. Really, that was the only thing Sid could find wrong with Forced Vengeance. I know it was 1982, but that could have broken down the barrier. We could have B action stars having orgies all over the place by now.

So, instead of something more aptly titled, ""Unforced Entrance,"" we got ""Forced Vengeance."" And that's just fine with Sid. It is a Chuck Norris movie set in Hong Kong, after all. Chuck plays Josh Randall--no, not John Rambo, Josh Randall. He's a one-man security force for the Lucky Dragon casino, which was founded by Randall's longtime friend Sam Pacal and is now run by Sam's son, David. Early in the film we see Randall's whipping prowess. He goes to collect a $115k gambling debt and simply destroys the gamblers henchman. But we also see his gentle side when he chastises David for making a dishonest dealer walk through the casino bareassed.  After a sexy...a time with his girlfriend Carrie, Norris gets back to the casino just in time to thwart a robbery with devastating barrages of roundhouse kicks that never come close to anyone.

Later, at Sam's house, David tells his father about a merger offer of sorts from Stan Raimondi. Raimondi is supposedly the leader of a crime syndicate and he wants to offer ""protection"" to the Lucky Dragon, but really he just wants to be there to see more bareassed dealers. So, Randall, Sam, and David go to see Raimondi. Raimondi offers Randall a job in an extremely awkward exchange Randall tells him, ""Thanks, but no thanks."" Raimondi replies, ""I'm not a man who hears no very often."" And just as one half Sid was saying to the other ""Wanna hear it again?"" Norris comes out with it. That's why we love the guy, he delivers. Norris then has a near run-in with Raimondi's goon, the second cousin of the ""You talk too much"" guy from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Ring/dp/B00069QD74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Ring</a>. This scene is important for many reasons, none more than than Norris spouts his favorite line in the movie again ""Yeah, that's right"" which is an old favorite of Santa himself. Randall then goes to Sam's only to find him and David murdered. The only one left in the family now is Joy, Sam's other kid, and the dark beauty mentioned above. So, Norris takes her and Carrie to a perfect rent by the hour motel complete with Asian Santa working the front desk. If ever there was an opportunity for Chuck to shoot the 3, this was it. But, no. Instead they go to see Laurence Fishburne's brother, Laurence Fishburne. This guy is an old friend who gives Chuck a sweet piece. And they have one hell of a look between them through which the sexual tension gushes. Chuck leaves the chicks with LeRoy Nicely--that's really the guys name--to track down some leads on Sam and David's killer. When he returns to Nate's(it totally sounded like Norris kept calling Nicely Nate, sending Sid into a frenzy every time) he finds Nicely badly beaten and Carrie raped and killed with Joy virtually unharmed by Raimondi's goon, Kam.

Holy Turbo Time. Now this is true: Chuck puts on his old Army uniform because he's going Commando. Oh! But, seriously, he's going on a mission to take out everyone involved in the Osirus syndicate. He takes out Raimondi by hanging him off the side of a yacht even though the noose had a good foot of room around his neck. It's a beautiful thing. Also in this sequence, Norris fights a guy who was the insiration for Robin Williams's portrayal of Popeye. Then he goes to get it on with the real head of Osirus, an old man in a wheelchair who is happily watching Tom and Jerry. Of course, he's flanked by Killer Kam. Yep, it's time for the last showdown. There is a horrifically delivered line by Kam, furthering the suspicion that he is the Asian Frankenstein. So, he and Chuck fight it out. Kam is legitimately whooping Chuck, but it's Chuck. He always manages to impossibly pull off the improbable. In honor of the end of Sid's Spring Break, you're getting drive-in totals. We knew you'd be thrilled.

389819,3,6301969847,"This was one of my favorite movies growing up.  It's not nearly as good as I remember, but I still like it, and it's still my favorite of Chuck's.  Only ""Lone Wolf McQuade"", and ""An Eye For An Eye"" come close.

The plot has Norris as a bouncer in a Hong Kong casino where his father-and-son bosses are an adopted family for him.  When the elder boss refuses to sell out his place to a proliferating casino chain, both he and his son are killed.  The sole heir to their fortune is the partying daughter that Norris must now protect from the greedy syndicate.

The story isn't particularly good, but it's quite adequate in linking lots of fight scenes together without sacrificing too much logic.  The pacing is what really makes this movie work.  Director James Fargo keeps the story moving with claustrophobic camerawork of back-alleys, boats, rooms at the brothel, and other places where bad guys could (and often do) attack.  Not to mention some beautiful shots of Hong Kong itself.  The fights aren't great, but they're some of the better ones I've seen from Norris, and there's lots of 'em.  Some are even choreographed.  There's also a delightful non-fighting cameo from Richard Norton (""Shanghai Express"")

The picture should be widescreen, but what are you gonna do?  In English or French, with Spanish, French, or English subtitles.  Recommended for fans of Norris and/or cliched 80's action films.  Others beware.

389822,2,6301969847,"Forced Vengeance is not one of Chuck Norris' better films. Norris' film career has been predicated on giving people what they want, and the way that they want it. But in this film, the plot gets convoluted, and the action is not good enough to make up for that shortcoming.

Norris plays the bouncer at a casino in Hong Kong. The owner, who has become like a father to Norris, is murdered by a syndicate trying to take it over. Norris goes out for revenge, and becomes emeshed in a vast conspiracy and lots of bloodshed. It gets hard keeping up with who's doing what, to whom, and even why, and after a while, you don't care. Which would be okay if that action was so spectacular that it made you forget about the plot deficiencies. But it's not.
