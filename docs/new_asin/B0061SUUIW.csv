8490962,1,B0061SUUIW,"Don't you think 30$ is a little too much for 6 episodes? I get more out of monster quest season 1 and 2. That is not counting shipping. What more I am dissatisfied with? Amazon wrote that it will only play on DVD ''play only'' devices. Other DVD players will probably not able to run the videos and PC will also be unable to play this DVD disc. I already had purchased other DVD discs made on demand. Quality of the package always sucks, none the less. Plus there are no special features. Until you have proper season 1 and season 2, made properly for DVDs and PCs alike, I will not be giving you my money and especially that much for that little!",1372809600,,647,4.225806451612903
