4720704,5,B005LAIGYQ,"A group of Navy Seals are on a mission to stop an Islamic radical who is working with a drug smuggler to commit terrorist acts. What makes this movie unique is that the Navy Seals are the real deal, not stuntmen and professional actors. Their lack of training in regards to acting is apparent, but that does not detract from the excitement throughout as they engage in realistic combat missions against the bad guys. The film successfully combines the action of the Seals with actors portraying other characters to make a very exciting combat action movie that will stir your patriotic senses.",1330473600,8,593,4.823529411764706
4720705,5,B005LAIGYQ,"When the directors worked with the US Navy on a separate project, they dreamed up the idea for an accurate movie about the Naval Special Warfare (NSW) community, they realized that there just weren't actors that could fill the roles.  So they collaborated with the Navy and real NSW personnel to make this movie.

A SEAL platoon goes hunting, trying to unravel a skein of drug dealers, arms smugglers, jihadis, a plot to commit atrocities within the borders of the US.  They deploy around the globe in order to stop a massive terrorist act within the US, and at the same time allow a glimpse into the personal lives of these men and their families, and the other service members that support them.

As much as a SEAL recruiting film, it seemed like the NSW small boat guys were pitching their career opportunities too, and a cinematic exposition of the tools of NSW.  High altitude, low opening (HALO) parachuting, submarines modified to support SEALs, UAVs, and other equipment was prominently displayed, but it was clear that the equipment was only there to aid the men in their mission, and that no technology would replace their training.  Still, gadget junkies will get a fix with real rather than made-up hardware.  The boat crews, especially, seemed like they enjoyed their work greatly.

The most intriguing character, and the most proficient actor of the Navy personnel was Senior Chief, the intelligence analyst/interrogator.  Of all the sailors in the film, he was the one that could be mistaken for a professional actor, but during his interrogation scene, one can understand why his specialty would give him the skills that transfer to performance.  This also made for an interesting subtext; the brutal torture by bad guys failed to get the subject to talk but the professional interrogation by the Navy interrogator broke the subject without the interrogator laying a finger on him.

All in all, an excellent action flick.  The quality of acting generally wasn't stellar, but given the tax dollars spent training these men for their disciplines, that can be excused.  These were special warfare operators in a film, not actors pretending to be something they're not.

4720706,5,B005LAIGYQ,"I saw the previews for this movie in a commercial on the Super Bowl.  Real active duty SEALS in a movie??!! No way.  Checked out the website - well, I'll be darned - yes way.  How 'bout that?  Not only that, no CGI and LIVE fire (yeah, real bullets)?!  Okay, this just gets better and better.  Gotta check it out.  Well, I did and it's a good thing the theater had the option of reserved seating because when I went on Saturday afternoon the matinee was sold out as were the evening showings.

I don't even know where to start.  This movie, in all honesty, is one of the best I have ever seen.  I'm writing this two days after seeing the movie and there were scenes I will never, ever forget.

POSSIBLE SPOILER:  The extract will absolutely keep you on the edge of your seat.  The actual Act will gut you.  You have been warned.

Hurt Locker was a very, very good movie, but that was actors and Hollywood.

Act of Valor goes way, way beyond that because the military cast is the real thing and they made sure the movie was filmed just that way.

Hoo-Yah, guys!  Ya did good.  Movies really don't get better than this one.",1330300800,36,1121,4.252380952380952
4720707,4,B005LAIGYQ,"There may be spoilers.

From what I've read co-directors Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh were given uncommon access to military knowhow and technology, specifically the U. S. Navy SEALs.  Their original goal was to produce a quasi-documentary/recruiting film.  That evolved into a full length commercial film.  From that perspective I suspect they hit their mark.  There are some unusual aspects to this movie.  With some obvious exceptions, the primary cast is made up of real life active SEALs.  It is pretty clear they are not actors but I'm inclined to give them plenty of slack in that area.  I doubt real actors could have delivered some of the combat lingo and battle maneuvers like the real deal either.

SEAL Team 7 is assigned a mission to rescue a kidnapped CIA agent (Roselyn Sanchez, TV's ""Without a Trace"") from terrorists located in Costa Rica.  She had been close to uncovering a jihadist plot to infiltrate the U. S. from Mexico.  In a bit of a sticking point, prior to their departure the filmmakers spend an unusual amount of time showing the men with their families so that we know they are just regular guys.  They have wives and kids.  You know just guys no different than any other neighbor.  It was a little much.

What isn't overdone are the action sequences.  They are absolutely thrilling.  I was especially taken with the initial mission to rescue Agent Morales (Sanchez).  This involved parachuting in at night, navigating through the jungle and swamp and taking out the capturers with machine-like precision.  The first-person-video-game-like helmet-cam brought a snicker at first but it isn't overdone.  In a heart-pounding escape, the team is overwhelmed with bad guys, but is also aided by swift boats dropped into the river by huge helicopters.  So cool.  The bad guys have some big guns, but so does the Navy and they know how to use them.  Subsequently, a retrieved Blackberry leads the commanders to uncover details about the bigger plot.

Working with a Russian smuggler, a Chechnya terrorist has lined up 16 Philippine suicide bombers to wear vests filled with explosive ceramic ball bearings and ignite them in various U. S. cities.  As the mission continues, the SEAL Team takes out half the terrorists in one location but must move near the U. S. border in Mexicali to prevent the remainder from tunneling in under the protection of the local drug cartel.  Working with their Mexican counterparts this final battle will have many casualties including some good guys.  I must admit I loved the action sequences in this movie, but the screenplay is a clunker.  Frankly it is irrelevant.  This is the best military recruiting film since ""Top Gun"" and even with its flaws is worth seeing.

BLU RAY UPDATE (6-10-14)

This second viewing on Blu ray provides reinforcement on some of my initial comments.  The film purposely is one-sided but I knew that from the beginning.  And I have to say, the best part are the action sequences, especially the first rescue of the captured CIA officer.  As the bad guys are about to outgun the escaping SEALs, they run into 2 swift boats armed with .50 cal. machine guns.  Game over.  Regardless of one's political beliefs, this is an adrenaline inducing scene.  On to the Blu ray disc itself.

The video has a 1080p resolution with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Using small digital cameras, the filmmaker's you-are-there feel comes across beautifully in this transfer.  Colors and skin tones are perfect.  Jungle greens and desert tans come across accurately.  In some of the night sequences, you might find a bit of visual noise but it's not distracting.  With a non-stop action flick like this you would hope to get a solid audio track.  And boy do you.  It comes in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and it's a stunner.  The viewer is caught in the middle of the constant action sequences and the sound onslaught is everywhere.  Surprisingly, at least to me, the film has an excellent musical score thanks to Nathan Furst and it plays well when the scenes call for it.  Top shelf, demo quality audio.  Subtitles come in Spanish and English SDH. Here are the extras:

4720708,5,B005LAIGYQ,"I won't bother with the background of the story sine others already have.  The acting isn't Oscar worthy during scenes of discussion but the action and the recognition of what our military experiences in the heat of battle or skirmish is worthy of the word ""heroic""!  I was engrossed with the story, I cared about the characters, I was aware of their extreme bravery and extensive training and I was emotionally engaged.  Pretty good formula for this movie?  Absolutely!  There was a good crowd for the matinee I attended and a word was barely spoken afterwards.  Powerful experience when you realize this reality for the chosen few who volunteer for this job.  Excellent movie.  The ending reminded me of my Dad.  God bless our troops!",1330128000,10,736,4.824
4720709,5,B005LAIGYQ,"I absolutely love that they used actual ""real"" Navy SEALS.

My older cousin by Portland, Oregon was a SEAL during Vietnam.

This movie reminds me of when in 1995. My best friend Kevin and I went on the SEAL obstacle course in Coronado Island, California.

Can't wait to buy once it's on DVD. Hope they make a sequel soon.",1330128000,8,321,4.406779661016949

4720711,5,B005LAIGYQ,"I know some people will think this movie shouldn't have gotten 5 stars because of the acting.  I did not go to this movie for the acting, I went to see our real life Navy Seals pay tribute to those who sacrificed everything for our country, and I was not disappointed.

I have read several books by Seals and about Seals over the years, starting way back when Dick Marcinko's first book came out, and I always watch any movie or tv special about them.  I feel it takes a special kind of person to do this job and it fascinates me.

This movie has a fictional plot; however, the extractions and sacrifices in the movie all have actually happened in the field and they are re enacted in this movie in different locations.  How awesome was it to sit their and watch the things I had imagined in my head in real life.  I say real life, because these are things they actually do, real technology actually used, real split second decisions actually made.  The action was fantastic and I will go see this movie again on the big screen to make sure I caught everything.

What was most profound to me was the way the team worked together and their commitment to each other.  The fact that they can see something horrific happen to their best friend, and keep doing their job, put their emotion aside until their mission is done.  I have read in countless books about men that keeping going while wounded not for themselves or to get back home, but so they don't let down the person next to them, the person they go into battle with.  This movie shows that.  It shows these men to be multi faceted.  They are not war mongers.  They are men with families and a deep sense of history and honor.  This is what I feel should be taken away from the movie.

So if you are not sure what you are getting into with this movie, they were not shy about head shots and brain splatter, they did not focus on it, it was all done in a very matter of fact way, but it is there.  There is a torture scene that made me squirm, not graphically shown, but you knew what was happening.  Overall though if you have let your child play Grand Theft Auto or 1st person shooter games, this is not any more violent.

This movie is not a propaganda or recruiting film it is real life. Remember that when watching, don't look for something to be there for a political reason, as an american look at this film and be proud, appreciative and thankful that we have men like this willing to give everything so that we can be safe.  I for one am, and I was really glad they listed the Seals that sacrificed everything for us at the end.  This movie broke my heart while instilling a huge sense of pride for our servicemen and first responders.  I hope everyone goes to see this movie on the big screen it is worth it.  I don't know but I hope the producers/studio whomever is in charge makes a substantial donation to the Navy Seal Foundation as the men in this movie were not, nor did they want to be compensated.

Anyway I will be purchasing this movie as soon as it is available and encourage you to do the same, it is important to know what someone will sacrifice for you.",1330041600,506,3132,4.278438030560272
4720712,4,B005LAIGYQ,"Navy SEALs are America's warriors du jour. Remember that spectacular demonstration of marksmanship when three of them, standing on a tossing boat, felled three hostage-holding Somali pirates with simultaneous shots? That was followed a year or so later by the end of Osama bin Laden, so these elite fighters are the ones we look to for military prowess.

I can only hope this film's regular release contains the introduction by the two principals behind this project. They were embedded with a platoon of Navy SEALs in hopes they would get enough material for a movie. It quickly became obvious to them that there are NO Hollywood actors who could approach the calibre of the men they were with, in terms of fitness, devotion to their families, intelligence, and skill levels. Consequently, they cast a group of active duty SEALs! (Shooting was occasionally delayed while cast members were briefly deployed.) When we know those guys up there on the screen have actually done the things we see, it adds immeasurably to our involvement; plus, many of the scenes were shot using live ammo!

The upshot is, even though the Bandido Platoon is a fictitious one, this story is based on feats of the most elite, highly trained group of effective warriors in the modern world, using up-to-the-minute technology under highly challenging circumstances. Because of artistic license, we see the same seven men off the coast of Somalia, in the Ukraine, in the tropical forests of Costa Rica and just south of the Mexican border. They are trying to stop a chilling plot that uses ceramic pellets in suicide vests. Ceramic doesn't set off metal detectors, so terrorists plan a coordinated attack in crowded areas: football games, shopping malls, concert arenas and airports. When explosives kill and maim hundreds, the economic impact will be devastating (like 9/11).

This film starts with the rescue of a kidnapped CIA operative, which leads to the terrorists, who are linked to drug cartels in Mexico (they know how to penetrate America's borders). The domino effect of international terrorism and drug trade is compelling stuff. How can the American drug consumer ignore the down-range impact of his or her folly! Expect lots of gunfire, SCUBA diving, some really satisfying blowie uppie stuff, and stealth warfare (when these seven guys silently break the surface of that stream... goosebumps!).

I found this far more involving than your average run-of-the-mill action film. It's clear that these guys are SEALs, not actors, but there wasn't a moment when anyone's attention strayed; we were rooting for them to complete their mission so they could all return home to their families. As the tag line says: The only easy day was yesterday.

I will request notification when this DVD is available on Amazon.com.",1329782400,92,2799,5.076086956521739
4720713,5,B005LAIGYQ,"You might notice the date for this post is two weeks before launch. that is because I am part of the military and was invited to an advance showing of this movie.

Non-spoiler summary: Act Of valor is based around SEAL Team 7 sometime around September 2010. This is a fictionalized film, these events really did not happen but they are based on events that have happened to SEALS since the war on terrorism. In 2007 the two directors of this film, Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh, worked on a film project where the navy allowed them to work with real Navy SEALS. The directors came out with an idea to make a realistic movie based on the Navy SEALS. While deciding on casting they decided that the only people they wanted playing the Seals were the Seals they met themselves. Act of Valor uses real Navy SEALS and at times real ammunition in some of the fire fight scenes.

If you have not seen this film I definitely recommend to at least rent it. It is not a documentary but it is the most realistic military movie that I have seen. Definitely worth a viewing.

Some Spoilers:

A CIA operative is captured by a drug smuggler. SEAL Team 7 is sent in to save her. SEAL Team 7 discovers the Drug smuggler is connected to a high level terrorist that seeks vengeance on America. The SEALS are in a race against time to uncover the plot and stop the terrorist before they reach their target in America.",1328832000,239,1394,4.391472868217054

4720867,5,B005LAIGYQ,"I get why people complain about the acting. These guys are better at tactical thinking and movement than reciting a script. You can't beat the authenticity of the movie though. For them it was probably like another day of training. The overall plot I thought was very well written because its plausible. There are threats out there that we don't see. There are also men and woman out there working to combat those threats. The action scenes were great. The movements and communication was realistic. I have a buddy who was an Army Ranger and he told me that everything was pretty much spot on. Obviously some of the scenes are exaggerated but, that's what makes movies fun. Who doesn't love a car exploding like a nuclear bomb? The part I appreciated the most was the ending. I won't say why but, once again, realism.

4721053,2,B005LAIGYQ,"Having real Navy SEALs in your movie sounds like a good idea but in execution, without a real filmmaker or story, the results can be catastrophic.

The acting is terrible - fine, these aren't actors but the movie has a very cheap, made-for-TV look.  The director does not really shoot the action very well save for a couple of scenes and they rely on the first-person POV gimmick a few too many times.  The story and characters were written light on purpose I assume.  It reduces the workload for the non-actors but also leaves the movie pretty plain.

You'll just watch from scene to scene, waiting for the action.  There is an interrogation on a yacht that stood out as better than anything else that didn't involve shooting in the movie.

Watch Lone Survivor, American Sniper, Zero Dark Thirty (final scene), or 13 Hours and see if you feel the action or overall film is suffering because the actors lack real-life military experience.  In a movie, you fire blanks and are never under a real threat.  There accuracy with a firearm never comes into play.  I feel an actor can be trained to LOOK like they know what they're doing, at least enough to convince a general audience.  Editing, special effects, and stunt doubles makes that even easier.

Employing real-world warriors is admirable but overkill it what is ultimately fake combat no matter how real you try to make it.  Act of Valor might have worked better as a short film or a web series.",1515196800,,1450,4.63921568627451

I won't ruin it, but holy-hell when the gun boats arrive - I swear could feel the spirit of George Washington come upon me as the Dillon M134 mini-gun unleashed its fearsome capabilities upon the foe. I may or may not have been ejected from my local movie theater for standing up and loudly cheering during the height of this scene.

The strongest parts of this movie are the action scenes; although there's surely some Hollywood depiction of how these sorts of specialized engagements happen, they give the viewer a thought provoking portrayal of American military tactics and technology.

Although not professional actors, three cheers for the Navy Seals! Truly larger than life men who are some of the most highly respect war fighters in the world.

The plot was rather average, as was the grand finale. But gosh dang, the ""coming in hot"" scene counts for me as one of the most memorable, gasp inducing war scenes. Absolutely bad to the bone.",1497052800,,1034,4.863636363636363

From start to some what to the end (to be honest I skipped parts of the movie) it was like the director(s) played or watched COD ""Call of duty"" and used the scenes, situations, campaign and story lines and said ""hey lets copy and use these cutscenes and some game play/kill cams and adapt it to make a movie! I agree with other reviews. Lone survivor and American sniper and others make for a better movie. No disrespect to our military.

I had to pause every 30 sec., look away, close my eyes, look at something stationary, watch another 30 seconds of wobbly camera action and repeat. Good grief.  To the producers: you don't need to pretend that you have an inebriated camera person in order to improve the story; there's no need to force it; the story tells itself; it's plenty intense already. This style of cinematography DETRACTS from the story.

As for the acting--that's how they truly act and interact. As for when they're calm, that's the eye of the storm. They'll process their emotions later, in private.

It's an emotional watch. I avoid movies that make me cry, but I make exceptions for movies that might help me understand what one of my loved ones has lived through, and doesn't really talk about.",1486771200,,827,4.729166666666667

Their acting, the look, the action and cinema of this is way off the scales for what budget I'm guessing they had to spend.  So well directed.  I'd say Hollywood should scope these guys up but I don't want this talent misdirected.  I am also so sick of violence because it's way over the top and ridiculous.

The most heart wrenching scene is 100% true. & a tribute to Petty Officer Mike Mansoor.  Stay for the credits as they honor all the SEALs who have lost their lives since 9/11.

A very human narrative that pulled no punches about the reality of special operations teams. Leave your politics to one side - this is about the men & families that deserve nothing but respect and gratitude.  The movie is about the tip of the spear not the decisions that happen when and where it's fired.

For action lovers - the swift boat hot extract will blow your mind it looks so real because it is and done in one shot - amazing !

4724326,5,B005LAIGYQ,"Best Look Into the SEALs Without Being One

 Everyone has seen the classic action film with an overload of special effects, crazy car and fight scenes, and no real plot or deeper meaning behind it all. However, Act of Valor takes the classic action film and applies reality to it. While Act of Valor has all the great characteristics of that of a great action film it puts in a deep message and real life look into combat and war. This film shows that the ones who deserve to survive do not always walk away with minimal scratches like the good guys in your regular action movie. Act of Valor captivates its viewer and makes you want to see more. Through all the twists and turns you feel all sorts of emotions and real attachment towards the people you are watching on the screen.

The film takes you into the world of the U.S. Navy SEALs. Showing you all sorts of aspects about the SEALs such as how they operate during missions, all the gear and weapons, the people who they fight, and the type of people they are. All of these aspects are very intriguing to see, especially due to the fact that the SEALs do not release much information to the public. Act of Valor specifically focuses on one mission that is currently at hand that the CIA is working on with the SEALs. This mission on the surface appears to be simple and straightforward. However, the mission develops into something huge and much greater than expected. Which represents and goes to show how warfare and dealing with international criminals is certainly no easy task. The film takes you through all the steps of the mission and keeps you interested in what will develop next in the film.

Some of the actors used in the film are active duty SEALs. This being said, the acting is not phenomenal for obvious reasons. Acting is such a huge aspect of films but with Act of Valor they manage to get by without having exceptional acting. The fact that the guys playing Navy SEALs in the film are actually Navy SEALs really adds significantly to the movie and makes it more realistic. What this movie lacks in acting skills is made up in the mission scenes where the actors are doing what they more or less do on a real mission. During missions you see and hear all the hand movements, communication lingo, tactical movements, and the comradery shown by the SEALs. Yes, the film does not have the best acting ever seen in a film but having real SEALs in the film adds more to it than I think professional actors would.

The camera work in this film is something that is very deserving of being mentioned. Throughout the action scenes there are many different angles used which really adds to the scenes. One specific example is when a target is shot on a dock and is going to fall into water and make noise but a SEAL is there and catches him. The camera is being positioned in the perspective of the SEAL under the water. The overall camera work does a great job; especially during the action scenes making them seem more realistic and intense while watching.

Act of Valor is a unique action film that makes you happy, sad, appreciative, and thankful. Not every action movie is able to achieve that, which is what makes this film so great. Act of Valor leaves you with an array of emotion that makes the film special and unique from other action films. I would recommend seeing this film to even someone who does not usually watch action movies because Act of Valor is able to depict the selflessness of the people defending this country and much more.",1443657600,,3519,4.507836990595611

Learn about it, admire it then find things bigger than to love and honor, like God, country, family. Can you tell these guys left an impression on me?",1436745600,,308,4.517857142857143

I saw this movie on TV awhile back, thought the story wasn't bad and very impressive visually. I've read on imdb.com that most of the actors were active duty Seals and that much of the storyline is based on fact. I guess the Pentagon thought it would make a great recruitment gimmick.
At under $8 ""Act of Valor"" is much better than most action moviesespecially for the price range, worth owning.",1436745600,,557,4.470588235294118

4724820,5,B005LAIGYQ,"The main criticism I've heard is that the dialogue was labored and not well-acted. I would say that compared to what most movies try to bring to their character development, that is true. At the same time, these actual SEALs were functioning as they do as operators, not actors. If I think of how most of my conversations are with my friends, little of them would look great on film. However, the fact these guys actually do this stuff in real life (rather than it simply being a wildly-scripted action film) makes this movie a good pick for anyone with curiosity about Special Ops beyond Discovery Channel and Military Channel re-creations. In my humble opinion, it is almost more documentary than Hollywood movie...and worth seeing.",1435363200,3,734,4.88

4725037,4,B005LAIGYQ,"Outstanding. This movie was really excellent, and I recommend it to everyone. I am an extremely tough grader, and I only give 5 stars to absolute classics. Like the title of my review says, this is still one of the best war movies since 1990, though, and definitely should get 4 to 4.5 stars.

For anyone that doesn't know, they used real Navy Seals for the cast of this movie. It lent a really nice realism to the whole thing. With most Navy Seal movies, the Seals are portrayed by Hollywood guys who might actually be the anti-war type, and you're sort of rolling your eyes at them. This takes care of that, even if none of these Seals are Sir Lawrence Olivier. The acting suffers somewhat and there is an ever so slightly cheesy, amateur feel to this movie, but I think you will agree that the move to use real Seals kicks this movie into high gear and makes it a real thrill ride. It also avoids the common stupid mistake of bogging down in talking and relationships. This movie rocks and rolls for almost two hours straight. It moves from one action scene to the next. The mise en scene, and the photography are actually a complete top notch job. They are A-list and are better than many A-list movies out there.

Quite simply, this movie rocks and delivers everything it should. It was mammoth watching SWCC lay down some fire power. This movie was truly excellent, and every war movie fan should watch it. Four stars, easily, and I would actually put it in the same league as ""Saving Private Ryan,"" although it was quite different from that movie.",1432771200,9,1554,4.487632508833922

An elite team of Navy SEALs embark on a covert mission to recover a kidnapped CIA agent.

What did I think?

A bizarre mishmash of recruitment ad and feature film. Military enthusiasts will no doubt enjoy a realistic look inside some interesting operations but the average viewer may struggle with the staccato plot.

The discordance is heightened by the occasional switching to first person shooter view (ala Call of Duty games). The use of real Navy Seals has pros and cons but the fact it was often difficult to tell the two wooden main characters apart just shows how generic and cliched this movie is.",1431561600,,623,4.7407407407407405

4725650,5,B005LAIGYQ,"So I'll admit a slight bias here, because my brother is in the movie (he's the ONE that's actually a good actor. And that's unbiased...all of the reviews said the same thing.

Anyway, this movie is AMAZING if you watch it as it's intended. It's an action movie. The action scenes are awesome. Using the real SEALs I think really does improve the authenticity of what they're doing in the movie, because that's really what they do in the field. And yes, I'm sure some of it is tactically incorrect, whatever. Either way, I think it's way more accurate than most other films in this genre.

The dialogue is a bit more on the meh side, because obviously most of these guys aren't actors. There are some really heartfelt moments that I could identify with - when the families are saying goodbye as they leave for their mission, when they're all together on the beach, all of that. I've seen it firsthand, and it rang incredibly true. Maybe not the words they were saying, but the emotion behind it. And the interrogation scene was pretty incredible. Let's just say he's definitely a method actor...

When I watched this movie, I was incredibly glad that my big bro was about to retire. It terrified me looking at what they do, but I'm so proud that they're out there able to do it. I loved it, and everyone I know who's watched it has too.",1427414400,3,1335,4.48559670781893

However, I think the film showcases a level of courage, sacrifice, and training that is nothing short of astounding.

Thankfully, we have guys like this who are willing to risk their lives against overwhelming odds in places most of us have never heard of.

The acting is weak, but the combat scenes here are first rate. Really convincing, and that includes people being shot. So, if that kind of action offends your sensibilties then you should probably pass on watching Act of Valor.

This film is wall to wall action with a minimum of dialogue. The ""hot extraction"" on the river - though brief - is one of the best action sequences I have ever seen.

The ending is sad but well done.

The Navy has a dual personality when it comes to the SEALs: on the one hand they supply support and help develop movies like this; on the other they don't like their SEALs to talk about what they do or where they've been.  :)  All the episodes in this movie are based on actual events.

4726851,5,B005LAIGYQ,"Act of Valor is a full throttle high-octane celebration of American warrior spirit as exemplified by today's US Navy Seals.  What a revelation to see the American fighting man unabashedly celebrated in a high budget film with all the Hollywood technical bells and whistles!  This is an action-packed movie that utilizes all the real-world infiltration and combat skills of the Navy seals.

The complete villainy of this films' villains is established early (a la Bond) with a brutal bombing of an international school in Manila. Act of Valor contains favorable allusions to warrior leaders such as Winston Churchill and Tecumseh.  Act of Valor ultimately reminds us of the brilliant Orwell quote, ""We sleep safe in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm.""

Let's make no mistake about it -- the ""warrior spirit"" that this film celebrates is firmly in the American tradition of  the minutemen at Lexington and Concord, the Marines with Eaton at the battle of Derne in Tripoli (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Pirate-Coast-Thomas-Jefferson-the-First-Marines-and-the-Secret-Mission-of-1805/dp/140130849X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Pirate Coast: Thomas Jefferson, the First Marines, and the Secret Mission of 1805</a>), the rough riders with TR on San Juan Hill in the Spanish-American war, the Millionaire's unit of World War I (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Millionaires-Unit-The-Aristocratic-Flyboys-Who-Fought-the-Great-War-and-Invented-American-Air-Power/dp/1400102502/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Millionaires' Unit: The Aristocratic Flyboys Who Fought the Great War and Invented American Air Power</a>&nbsp;and many more.

All of the seal team actors are played by real active duty Navy seals.  This is the real deal.  These men have all put their lives on the line for their comrades and their country.  They are truly the sharp point of the spear.  Nor was any of the films' action pure invention -- every action sequence in Act of Valor that happens on screen has actually taken place in the real world in the past ten years.  Nor is the scroll of US Navy dead that ends the film or so invented.  These are some of the real casualties from the past twelve years in the global war on terror.  For every name we see on screen of an individual who gave his life there are also other wounded and maimed soldiers. For every name we see on screen there is a grieving family that will never forget.

We also see a volunteer military service that represents all segments of contemporary American society.  A rainbow coalition of white, black and hispanic personnel all celebrate together, fight together and grieve together as brothers in arms. Even Harvard and Yale have re-established a naval ROTC program.  We may now look forward to ivy league seals in the near future. Could it be that patriotism is making a comeback?

Act of Valor, in addition to the well-choreographed action sequences, deftly portrays the anguish of the home front for military families as well.  Eleven month deployments away from family are routine in these men's lives and wrenching for their loved ones.  In a world caught up in a struggle for economic survival and advancement, a small group of self-selecting warriors, many of whom have a multi-generational connection to military service, hold themselves aloof from worldly self-interest.  They deserve our eternal gratitude and respect.  These veterans of the shadow wars of the past decade are finally receiving some overdue recognition with Act of Valor.

This film posits the existential reality of evil in the world.  Act of Valor is an old-fashioned movie which asserts that the personal valor and sacrifices of ""damned few"" can and do make a difference in this world.  Check it Out and Go Navy!

4726956,5,B005LAIGYQ,"If you are seeking a fantastic action movie with very little dialog this is a movie you should check out.  Act of Valor stars Roselyn Sanchez and Nestor Serrano. The film was directed by Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh.  Actually, many people think this movie is more of a recruitment movie for the elite U.S. Navy SEALS, which is fine with me.

 One of the things that make this movie unique is that actual active U.S. Navy SEALS are in this film.  This makes it a more realistic action film than other similar theme movies. This is a story based upon some of the real life missions the Navy SEALS have been called on to do.  The action and combat scenes are realistic and exciting. I have always been a great fan of movies about special operation units like the Navy SEALS, Army Rangers, Marine Recon and other similar branches of the military.

If you are seeking an action packed movie that shows the equipment and some of the tactics used by the U.S. Navy SEALS this movie is a must see.  I saw this movie when it first came out at the theaters and loved it, and I recently bought the DVD at a bargain price.

4727017,3,B005LAIGYQ,"Act of Valor
 Act of Valor famously uses active duty Navy Seals as the principal actors.  This is a bold and innovative way to make a film and the producers are to be congratulated for their courage.  It also makes for a two tiered experience for the viewer, one tier of excellence and one tier of mediocrity-at best.
 The film is set in contemporary time.  The subject is the tracking and disruption of a terrorist organization which intends to use explosive vests loaded with undetectable ceramic ball bearings to murder Americans in some 18 different locales.  This is a danger sufficient to engage the interest of the US military, and in particular the interest of the Navy Seals, regarded by many to be the most expert military organization on the planet.  This is good fodder for the action film fan.
 The close association of the film makers and actual Navy Seals must have contributed to the realism and excitement of the battle scenes, which happen frequently.  These are some of the most engaging battle scenes ever done.  There is an intensity and immediacy that is unparalleled.  The film show in some detail just how good the Seals are at their job.
 The cinematography is also outstanding.  I was taken just how beautiful our world is in some of the shots.  We are also reminded that the world is also a deadly place, sometimes with passing close-ups of insect life but also switching from a gorgeous sunrise to an interior shot of very bad guys questioning a CIA agent.  The agent is played by one of the professional actors and one of the few that might be recognized by the viewer, the beautiful Roselyn Sanchez who has nearly two hundred film and TV appearances.
 And there is the rub.  The heroes are played by genuine heroes, active duty Navy Seals.  They look and move like the professional warriors that they are.  They have a compelling screen presence.  The bad guys and the Seals family members are professional actors who do their journeymen work with competence.  It is jarring and distracting whenever the warriors speak their lines.  It is hard for anyone to act in a way that is convincing to the viewers.  Thats way actors generally begin their study in high school and often continue to hone and perfect their craft throughout their careers.  The warriors are not actors, which is quite clear whenever they speak. When I first saw the trailers that billed the film as having active duty Navy Seals playing the Navy Seals, I assumed that the speaking roles would be reserved for professional actors, as might be expected.  Not so.  The leading players are the Seals.  Sadly for the viewer, the Seals are heroes, not actors.
 I liked the film more than the subpar two and a half saw blades rating shows.  The R rated film runs for one hundred and eleven minutes.  The first time director/producer team of Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh should be proud of their effort, which will surely be a major financial success.  Writer Kurt Johnstad (of 300 fame) wrote a tight, exciting script that is better than the non-professional actors reciting his lines.  The production budget of around $12 million has been boosted to $43 million by advertising and printmaking.  The film opened Friday on over 3,000 screens nationwide.  Even with the more than tripling of the producers original outlay, this film should be a solid money maker.  It is just plain satisfying to see fictional bad guys dispatched by actual heroes.",1412640000,,3437,4.758037225042301

4727199,5,B005LAIGYQ,"Saw this on TV and decided I need my own copy.
Not Hollywood.  If you want Hollywood, get Sly Stallone or somebody of that sort.  This film took me back to Vietnam (and much as the youth today would like to think otherwise, we had the same sort of personnel as this movie - not so well equipped, but we did invent the training, like it or not) and my training for my job, CSAR.  People have yapped about the acting, but again, it's not Hollywood, and as stated, there are no actors who are capable of doing what's necessary.  Takes a particular type of individual to even make it through the training of special operations, be it SEAL, Special Forces, Force Recon or whatever.

The lines?  Well, anyone who has ever been in an intense combat situ knows you don't tell dumb stories that have nothing to do with your current situ: there is no script, there are no clever lines, there is no cute repartee when the guns are blazing, when (in my case) you see holes appearing in your helicopter or the muzzle flashes in the jungle.  This movie is pretty accurate.

As to some of the other criticisms, Mikey wasn't hit by a ""large caliber"" round in the head: if you look closely, the round was fired from a G-3 MBR, makes it a 7.62x51 (.308 Winchester) and it hit Mikey into the eye and out the temple, not a killing shot since there is no part of the brain in that bullet path.  Also, the dud RPG could really have been a dud, as those are not uncommon: everything does not always work as expected, does it?  Besides that, the RPG could have been and probably was one of the variety of antipersonnel grenades and not an armor piercing round. Flak vests etc are built to spread and dissipate the shock, so it's more than plausible to be struck by a dud RPG round and survive with nothing more than a healthy bruise.  That is, after all, why the vests were developed, isn't it?  Personally, my life is still here because of flak vests.  So those are non-arguments, along with the other about script.

All in all, well worth the watch.  Never sell any SOG short.",1411084800,,2054,4.354330708661418

So you can be shot in the head and survive its just extremely unlikely especially with a large caliber round like that. And the chances that that particular RPG was a dud is even more unlikely. Plus the head of RPGs are supposed to be molten and armor piercing. So the thing fires, but nothing else works? The force of impact would have broken his rips. And it is mostly it would have collapsed a lung or injured his heart. These aren't terrible mistakes, but could the first guy have been shot somewhere else? And the other guy just have been shot in his BULLET not RPG vest? Also I don't like how they make every Operator sound and behave in the same way. Just look at Lady Valor she was a Seal and got a sex change, they don't all have to be the same macho family guy.",1410048000,3,883,4.261904761904762

There's a scene where a few members of the SEALS rise up out of the water. If you watch that scene, and you blinked, the sound your eyelids made was louder.

4727599,5,B005LAIGYQ,"This is my second review of this film.  I'm doing this again because many people still don't understand what is going on.
First, the most aggravating point that is made is the apparent understanding of family and friend values concerning these men and what they do.  When men put their lives on the line every time they go on a mission, they don't know if they are coming home.  This is why they value the little things that the bulk of humanity takes for granted.  So, these men cling to the family and brotherhood.
They rely heavily on knowing each other inside and out so when the time comes to do their duty they can depend on the men around them.
  I thought this film was excellent in every respect.  They may not have won any ""Oscars"" for it but it gives incredible insight into what these very special warriors do.  They deserve all the recognition they can get.  Believe me!  They earn it!!
  Take a look a movies like ""Captain Phillips"" and ""Lone Survivor"" as well.  The grueling training that they go through shows just how special they are.
  I salute you men and so should everybody else.",1405555200,,1101,4.4623115577889445

4727725,5,B005LAIGYQ,"This movie was so authentic I actually recognized a US Navy ship that had been pulled up to the pier outside my window when I worked in a Naval Shipyard.  The active duty Navy seals who engaged in the action in the film were so impressive, their skills not exaggerated, and the glimpse of their family life heart warming.  While the threat to our country was chilling, the heroic actions re-enacted reiterated what an honor it is to have our military members protecting us.  The sacrifices shown in the film were heart rending and representative of the debt we owe to our warriors and their families.  I was also deeply moved and impressed by the honor shown to the CIA field operatives who risk so much and who serve without being openly identified to us as the heroes they are.  When  I realize this was a re-enactment of something a real person went through, I am moved to appreciate the real people who operate in secret to protect us all, including providing valuable intelligence to the military.  The connection between Russian mafia and the drug cartels on our very border is something I had suspected but hadn't had verified until now.  What it takes to keep our nation safe from these unholy alliances is mind blowing...as is this movie about the folks who do keep us safe.  Most moving was the honoring of all the Navy seals who have made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country from 911 to the date the movie was made.  We will never forget.

4727851,1,B005LAIGYQ,"The fictional action movie Act of Valor is pure propaganda - though not officially produced by the United States Navy, the project rose out of short Navy recruitment films created by co-directors Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh, the success of which led the filmmakers to ask the Navy to use not only real military equipment but also active-duty Navy SEALs in a feature-length narrative film.

Act of Valor exists for one purpose: To make the Navy, particularly its elite SEAL teams and their weapons and methods, seem so exciting, cool, and noble that viewers will, if not want to actually sign up, at least come away with an elevated opinion of and support for such military personnel and their country's endeavors. The film reinforces its message with plenty of visceral appeal, drawing both on the excitement and heroism of an action film and an emotional appeal based on the warrior tradition of honor, sacrifice, and brotherhood - all of it underscored by the fact that these are actual SEALs using real tactics and weaponry.

As military action entertainment, Act of Valor come with all the contrived premises and plot mechanics of the sub-genre. A Chechen Islamist has teamed with an opportunistic, hedonistic international smuggler to launch a massive suicide-bombing campaign in the United States. The film's elite SEAL team heroes are called forth and sent rushing around the world to thwart the attack. Peppered with military jargon and slang, the action unfolds either with awestruck panoramas of American firepower or from the gun-barrel point of view of a first-person shooter video game.

There are several visual moments in Act of Valor that grab - real Navy gunboats laying down a deadly field of fire, a real submarine slowly submerging - but they rely almost wholly on the filmmakers' access to genuine equipment operated by actual sailors rather than any inherent skill from the director. Otherwise, the movie is often a sub-par, uneven effort - for every scene that benefits from the verisimilitude, there are several that suffer from a lack of film-making and story telling skill and a slavish devotion to clich. For the most part, McCoy and Waugh rely on an all-too familiar excess of people, places, and things getting shot and/or blown up in big, orange fireballs and then making Big Speeches about the nobility of it all. Beyond the bullets and explosions, Act of Valor's real message is about the bravery and sacrifice of the men and women operating all that cool weaponry, with plenty of solemn talk about codes of honor, tradition, and warrior blood being passed down through the generations. The film's plot and characters remind us, ""There are threats everywhere,: therefore America need the man and women and military might and firepower so dazzlingly on display.

While Act of Valor's brutal villains are sneeringly played by professional actors, the film's Navy heroes, including its main protagonists ""Chief Dave"" and ""Lieutenant Commander Rorke,"" are portrayed by unnamed, real-life ""active-duty"" SEALs reportedly ordered by the Navy to participate in the film for promotional purposes, despite a prior history of strict operational secrecy. The SEALs are not good actors, and the film's hagiographic context and deferential direction does not allow the sort of naturalism that might have let the non-professional actors come off less stilted. The trade-off for using real SEALs and their to-be-expected lack of acting ability is that no one can accuse Act of Valor of sporting ""pretty boy actors playing with guns,"" but everything the ""real"" characters say and do feels heavily filtered through both action-film tropes and the Pentagon's public relations department. As characters, Dave and Rorke are not just good men, but good family men - they have human problems, but no real weaknesses, flaws, or failings. The heroes and the actions of the nation they serve are completely sanitized in the flames of ideology, sacrifice, and honor.

While the dramatic interactions in Act of Valor feel as stiffle staged as a 1980s corporate training film, the combat scenes with all their visceral, manipulative power are intended to play at some emotional level as documentary - the film opens with the claim it is ""based on real acts of valor"" and closes with the names of every Seal killed in action since September 11, 2001. As an action film, Act of Valor may be clunky and clichd, but the moments that do work as gut-level entertainment thrills only help sell the propaganda's message. For all the film's ""realism"" and talk about bravery and protecting America's freedom, this is still a war fantasy, intended to sell combat as a thrillingly dangerous adventure where even those who make the ultimate sacrifice do so in beatific slow motion and a ushered into the hallowed halls of Valhalla, their names and memories draped in honor.",1397520000,11,4862,5.080100125156446

To see some of the things of which they and our military are capable was stunning.  I've always had greatest respect for our military, special forces in particular, but it is even higher now.

When their in the water and that boat turns the corner blasting away at the enemies with some serious heat.  Seriously??!  That scene alone was bad a$$!!!  I had to pause, rewind, and watch that scene again.

4728020,2,B005LAIGYQ,"I understand the selling point of this movie is that ""real"" Navy Seals portrayed the main characters.  That's also its biggest fault.  The acting here is so bad that it literally undermines the entire film.  Just think of what a talented cast of actors could have brought to this film, with the ""real"" Navy Seals acting simply as advisors, rather than actors.  Even the action scenes in this movie don't come off as effective as they should because you never really care about the characters.  Everyone is either all-American patriotic good guy or sinister bad guy.  I have no problem with the blatant propaganda aspect of the film.  Stallone certainly did it in some of his Rambo movies.  But come on, I've seen better acting from digital video game characters (think ""The Last of Us"")",1392163200,,786,4.770370370370371

The movie not only keeps you at the edge of your seat the whole time, but it all is done in such a realistic format that it could very well have been 100% true. It was a wonderful idea to not only have Navy Seals to help make the movie but to make them the actors. If you like American action films with realistic events this is the movie for you!

Our men go through so much when they are risking their lives everyday. We just don't support our military like we should.

4728243,4,B005LAIGYQ,"So, first and foremost, this is a jingoistic movie about basically a band of assassins as they go around and shoot up a bunch of 3rd world locales, the mustache-twirling villains, and the musclebound goons who don't know any better than to just sit there like sitting ducks all muscle-bound and thuggish and holding guns.

Oh, and the 3rd world women, with their tearful faces, coerced into...yeah.

So, it is basically Call of Duty. Down to like the megamap and the little sound effect that goes on whenever they zoom around the map which makes it sound precise like clockwork and cybertech.

Disagree or not with the message, whatever. It's a dumb message. Let's get that out of the way.

And you can almost hear the writers of this thing...cringing. It's like, man graduates with an MFA in screenwriting, man dreams about writing the Casablanca of the millennial generation, man moves to LA, man waits tables, man is rejected by studios over and over who don't care about his carefully wrought out scene where the piano symbolizes the decay and end of an era, man is hired to write for this movie, man writes this movie, man inserts weird Roman Polanski joke in the middle of a movie about tough-guy Navy Seals.

Yeah, there's a Roman Polanski joke in this movie. It's weird.

Otherwise, it is well-done for what it is. You see the men being alpha back home, speaking in a Peyton Manning accent, the kind that's like country and masculine, then you see them murdering guys by the dozens with clocklike efficiency like blam blam blam blood blood blood dead brown guy. Then you see them in their quiet moments while they fret about like their families back home who live in subdivisions. Then they go murder another three dozen bad guys.

The neat part about this movie are the scenes where they go first person on you and you, the viewer, see like a disemboweled hand holding and firing a rifle -- LIKE YOU'RE ACTUALLY THERE. And it all pretty much goes as planned. The calvary saves the day. The sacrifices are made. Guys feel sad. The terrorists are stopped. The subdivision is safe.

For 2nd is this great journal of soldiers who are out today, battling in the far places from home. It's not a a storey really to me. It's more kinda of a documentary/slice of reality. This men are real men. They have no acting degree, and no real preparation for the big screen. This is their story. They use real weapons, real live ammo and real families.  With that said, their is really not much of a story plot in this. Now on to the features, I got to say, the action scenes are awesome. Now I do warn that their is a part of this movie that might or will be disturbing to viewers. Not for kids, trust me. Now the scene is a woman being kidnapped and taken to a hidden place. They ask her to give them info about her job, and I think you get to were I'm going at if she doesn't tell them. It's pretty disturbing and not something if you do get offended easily. It's an action movie, but it's also a close to reality movie. Past that scene and it get pretty good. Good soundtrack, amazing resolution and just a great movie.
Even though it say Blu-Ray, it actually is the DVD, with digital copy and the Blu-Ray DVD. All packed nicely. Sadly the features are in the Blu-Ray, sobrhatsvthebsad part. Hope this helps many.

It's nice that they show that they work in conjunction with intel and the ""Special Boat Squadrons"" to do some serious butt kicking! Their scenarios range from malaria infested jungles, arid high elevation deserts and strange foreign urban environments. But things can go wrong and people do die. That's just business for these guys. They are good. Occasionally the bad guys are good too..... Buy it! Don't bootleg this one!

4728472,2,B005LAIGYQ,"Propaganda. That is the best and the only way to describe this movie. Propaganda.

Act of Valor must have been made by the American army. I don't mean it as a joke nor am I being sarcastic. I sincerely believe in my heart of hearts that this movie was either commissioned by the Pentagon or the producers had approached the American government and said: ""Give us access to military equipment and money and we will make you a propaganda movie like you have not seen since World War II.""

I do realize that all movies that are made with the help from the military have to portray the army in good light. Would you help filmmakers make a movie if their movie would portray you as a bad person? But Act of Valor does not show the army in good light - it worships it.

Act of Valor is about a team of Navy Seals who find themselves pitted against a Chechen terrorist mastermind. Not surprisingly, the terrorist is a radical Muslim. Since 9/11, nine out of ten movies have a villain who is a radical Muslim extremist. This terrorist mastermind is working with an arms dealer. In Costa Rica, an undercover CIA agent (who looks like a supermodel and is played by a supermodel) uncovers some evidence linking the said arms dealer and the Chechen terrorist. She is kidnapped and tortured and the Seals are sent to rescue her. After they do so (after a battle, of course), they learn that the terrorist is planning to infiltrate a number of suicide bombers into the United States. This forces the Seals to head for Mexico where they try to intercept the suicide bombers. However, the terrorist is paying the Mexican drug cartels for protection, which results in not one but two battles. How this ends, I will not say to avoid spoilers, but don't expect any twist endings or shocking revelations.

The main characters are the Navy Seals. I must say that it has been long time since I've seen such bad acting. I am a very forgiving viewer when it comes to acting. I don't expect Oscar-winning style performances in all the movies that I watch. As long as the acting is passable, I will enjoy any movie as long as the plot, the characters (their psychology and interactions) and the dialogues are good. In Act of Valor the acting is so horrendously bad that I could barely stand it.

I could even forgive the bad acting if the rest of the movie was good, but the portrayal of the Seals is absurd. They spend their free time doing nothing but showing and telling each other how much they love their families, each other, their country and how great America is. We get long, sappy speeches about duty, honor and strong family values. Their dialogues, when not about technical military matters, are inane and completely unrealistic.

The problem is not that the Navy Seals in Act of Valor love their country and families. I am sure that almost all real-life Seals do too. The problem is that the Act of Valor Seals are living, breathing propaganda machines who do only two things - fight and promote America and family values. Their behavior and personalities are so wooden and unrealistic that halfway through the movie I stopped thinking of them as human beings. And, this also means that when they get hurt or die in the movie, I completely don't care.

The bad guys, on the other hand, were quite good. I enjoyed watching scenes with them and found them to be quite realistic. Granted, they are horribly flawed human beings at best and sociopaths at worst, but that is what makes them human. Such people (sadly) really do exist in real world. The Seals, as shown in this movie, are too unrealistic to be accepted as anything than G.I. Joe action figures made flesh.

Coming to think of it, it is quite an achievement for a hardcore pro-America, pro-Navy Seals, pro-war propaganda movie to make the foreign-born villains more interesting than the American heroes. While watching the movie I never went as far as to root for the bad guys, but I preferred to watch scenes with them rather than with the Americans.

The movie has one, and only one, redeeming quality, and that is the combat scenes. The Navy Seals, as human beings, might come out as completely unrealistic, but when in battle, they do fight like professionals. The battle scenes are very well done with real professionalism. The battle cinematography is a masterful blend of hyper realistic, almost documentary-like shots and action movie moments. The fight scenes are full of fast action and adrenaline, but at the same time they are realistic and you can easily follow what is happening. They are also professionally done from the military and tactical point of view. This is more or less how special forces fight in real life and the movie avoids all those clichs that you can find in action movies.

In conclusion, while this movie is great when it comes to action scenes, the rest of it is little more than nauseating propaganda. Overall, unless you are interested in special forces combat techniques and want to use this movie as research material, I would recommend that you skip it. I give it only two stars.",1381968000,3,5066,4.63768115942029
4728473,4,B005LAIGYQ,"""Act of Valor"" is a modern-day war movie with a concept that every film producer thinks of, but few would really execute: a movie about soldiers played by real-life soldiers. Casting active-duty Navy SEALs to play themselves (as well as several professional actors including Roselyn Sanchez as supports), directors Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh have created an action film that is deeply flawed but still worth watching for its authentic combat scenes.

The story goes like this. A Navy SEALs team led by Lieutenant Rorke (played by LCDR Rorke) is sent on a covert mission to rescue an abducted CIA agent (Roselyn Sanchez). In the course of accomplishing the mission they stumble upon a secret that involves an international smuggler and some packages.

""Act of Valor"" benefits from the great combat sequences that are intense and authentic, and the fine photography that helps raise the tension. I didn't find the acting that bad, probably because that's not what I expected from the beginning. (And I've seen worse acting by professional actors many times before, anyway.) The filmmakers know this is an action movie, and ""Act of Valor"" delivers.

But I did find the script by Kurt Johnstad thin and clichd, with too many expository dialogues and underwritten characters. The globe-trotting story that often lacks continuity is not only weak but slows down the pace of the film. All in all ""Act of Valor"" is not quite satisfactory, but as far as combat scenes go, the film is much above average.",1381536000,,1494,4.968

4728584,5,B005LAIGYQ,"Do you want to know what it's like to be a combat SEAL?  Watch this movie.  I'm married, 37 years, to a former SEAL (they are never ex-SEALs) and he and every SEAL I've talked to about this movie says it's the real deal.  I enjoyed it tremendously.  Having real SEALs star in the movie was a brilliant move.  SEALs can become actors.  Actors can never become SEALs.  I saw my husband in those characters.

Watching the interplay between team members and their activities shows how they have to become a team to succeed at the incredibly difficult tasks they are asked to accomplish.  Plus the movie shows the toll it takes on their families.  It highlights how incredibly physically and mentally tough they have to be, how strong the ties between them are, even their willingness to sacrifice themselves for their teammates.  SEALs never quit.  Never.  They will never let each other down.  Never.  If they say so, they will be there.  Always.  That's their brotherhood.

Some critics complain about the poor plot or the action jumping around the globe.  I had no problems following the plot or the action.  It was self-explanitory if you paid attention.  It also showed many of the different venues SEALs are trained for.  The action sequences were excellent and didn't dwell on slow-motion, gratuitous violence.  Yes, people were killed, this is a movie about a 'war' on terrorism.

Some critics complained about the one-shot one-kill.  This is how SEALs are trained.  It's accurate.  They are very good at what they do.  Would you trust your back to someone who ""might"" be able to make the shot?

Some critics pan the movie because of bad acting.  This is how SEALs act on missions, how they speak.  If you want to know how SEALS are made (yes, they are made) and what they do read 'Damn Few' by Rorke Denver.  He was one of the stars of 'Act of Valor' and a very experienced SEAL.

By far the best weapons handling and personal movement I have ever seen in a film. A very engaging and emotional film with true gravitas.

Real Americans should see this movie and then thank every veteran... after they have contributed to some of the many veterans support organizations.

4728759,5,B005LAIGYQ,"It's been a little less than a year since I watched this movie for the first time (I've watched my 5-6 times since) and it hasn't lost any feeling. While the wooden acting has been beaten to death I will say in their (SEALs) defense that they don't get paid to act.

After reading some of the 1 and 2 star reviews I had to make a review. Not many people realize that most, if not all the action scenes used live ammo, grenades, rockets, etc. Yes, they could hit the moving trucks while sitting in the bed of another moving truck (directors were shocked when they did). The extraction via boat also used real ammo and that Bronco was nearly cut in half by the mini-gun (All real. No CGI).  Yes, they were swimming under a storm of lead. Why? Because, they practice how they play.

This movie wasn't going to wow any Hollywood critics, but that wasn't the point. The point was to show the capabilities of the SEALs. To be honest, I'd rather watch this movie a million times than watch ""SEAL Team Six"" again. Sure STS had better character development (which is to be expected since they had real actors), but the overall feeling was too dramatized. Act of Valor is about as close as anyone is going to get to seeing them in action unless you have the misfortune of being on the receiving end of an assault. That in my opinion is what makes this a great movie and a must own.",1370217600,,1371,4.3062015503875966

4728867,5,B005LAIGYQ,"A very few times in my life I've seen a movie that left me feeling crushed and uplifted at the same time. Act of Valor was one of them. It's a movie that brings vividly to life something that few of us ever see; true heroism and true evil. Our world is growing smaller by the day, but in some ways it grows larger and more unknown. I think we all need to know that there are people out there who have no qualms about kicking a person in the face and rolling them up in a carpet to kidnap them.

One of the brilliant aspects of the movie was the use of the Canon Rebel for filming. The dSLR is just small enough to be taken into new locations that we've never seen before. There were sweeping, unbelievably beautiful shots of helicopters, submarines and swift boats, but at the same time with the use of the dSLR and the helmet mounted cameras, we were suddenly taken into the thick of things with heart stopping effectiveness. I've never felt so part of a movie before.

The Navy Seals that were recruited to make this movie aren't acting, they're just being themselves and the simplicity of their lines brings them powerfully to life. I felt like I knew them personally by the end as I sat at the edge of my seat, willing them to live.

But even Navy Seals, with all their state of the art equipment and specialized training, are mortal. The list at the end of the movie of those lost is short, but if there was only one name, it would already be too long. I assume that those same men that made the movie might possibly be down range right now, as I write this, keeping us all safe, silently and effectively. I want to know how they are, but unfortunately I'll never find out.

They're the closet you can get to Supermen this side of eternity and there are only a few of them. I'd give the movie six stars if I could.",1368057600,,1819,4.218390804597701

4728980,2,B005LAIGYQ,"2012's Act of Valor attempts to be one of the most patriotic films ever made, but as I watch it again, it seems to become one of the most unworthy films of the year. Hold your horses, I will try to explain.

The big draw to this movie during its ad campaign and pre-release state was that it was using real Navy SEALs as its cast, who would be performing real tactics used by this Special Forces branch of the U.S. Military. The audience gets to follow this team of elite soldiers on a mission to rescue a captive CIA field agent who is being held captive by terrorists. We then find out that this group from the middle east has allied with a Russian organization to suicide bomb several public area in the U.S., and the amount of estimated casualties was predicted to surpass the fatalities of the September 11 attacks. The SEAL team then goes on a mission to attack and disarm these bombers at the Mexico border, where they plan to enter the United States. One of the team is killed by a grenade, and the films ends at a funeral, dedicating itself to all the SEALs who have died since the attack on the World Trade Center.

This sounds all well and good, right? Apart from being very loyal to their country and having a general attitude of patriotism, these SEALs are shown in many early scenes with their wives and children, spending as much time as they can with them before they leave on their mission. However, the depiction of modern war in the film is the real problem here. I love a good action movie just as well as the next guy, however...is it such a good thing to stylize what those men are doing over their to protect all of us from these all too common acts of terror? And to market it as popcorn entertainment? This film was nominated at the Teen Choice Awards for the ""Choice Action Movie"" of 2012. Is that what the Navy SEALs have become, simply a cool subject for an action movie? No, these are real men, who are using real tactics, and reenacting real missions, only this time in front of a camera. These men should be treated with respect, and produce a film that shows one thing: war is hell. Look at the films that have done this accurately in the past. Saving Private Ryan. Black Hawk Down. Letters from Iwo Jima. Films that show the harrowing effects of war to those who witness it, and they literally make your gut wrench at times. The less popular sister film to Letters from Iwo Jima, called Flags of Our Fathers, tells the story of the men who raised the flag at Iwo Jima, and what happened to them after the war. They were called heroes and had their names in the paper, and all because a stray picture of them raising the flag was sent back home. These soldiers didn't even know if they were really the men in the picture because their were two different teams who put up flags in different locations on the day that the United States took the shores of Iwo Jima. That film showed fear in the face of war, and should be commemorated for its realism.

Act of Valor looks at all of these films that came before it and gave the teens who watched it a new look at war: nothing less than what one would experience in a Call of Duty video game. In many cases it is all too obvious. There are shots during combat taken from cameras worn on the SEALs helmets that when displayed on the screen look far too similar to a first-person shooter game than real life. Should this be the impression that American teenagers receive about war? Absolutely not. This is where I believe that many critics are spot on when they call Act of Valor nothing more than a two hour long recruiting video for the United States Military. Do I consider myself anti-military? Far from it, I have a passion for defending those who defend our country, and for awhile was seriously considering joining the Army. However, I knew what combat was going to be like, if I was going to be placed in it. Well, not precisely, because no one knows what it is truly like until they experience the horror for themselves. But I had a better understanding of war than a seventeen-year-old who just saw a film like this and decided to join up for God and glory. That is why during high school, war films like the ones I mentioned should be available for students who are interested in becoming soldiers to that they can get a vague idea of the atrocities that will await them if they join.

I know what I have written is of a very strong opinion, but it is something that needs to be said more often, especially with a future as uncertain as the one we face now looms overhead. Act of Valor is not entirely a ""bad"" film. It shows the men for who they are, fathers and husbands, who also give a great portrayal of the attitude needed of a SEAL...obviously, since that's their job. Honor is a heavy theme in the film, and the knowledge of duty to the mission and of one's country over all else while in the field. The concluding funeral scene is also very touching, ending with the image of the fallen soldier's comrades giving the widow her husband's flag. Patriotism. It is a value that seems to be losing its prominence among Americans today. I suppose the question the audience should ask themselves before watching this film is this: should we expose ourselves to over-glorified military propaganda disguised in the form of an action movie, when so many films before it have given the exact opposite message that it is trying to convey?

It was one of those movies that after watching, you walk away from the experience a different person. This movie inspires you to be a better person. That's a sign of a good movie.

As for the complaints in various Amazon customer reviews concerning the acting, dialogue, and plot of the movie, to these people I say, ""Get a life."" These complaints are trivial and result in the missed high points and quality of the movie. These people missed the point.

If you like the movie as much as I did, I highly suggest reading Mr. Denver's new book entitled, ""Damn Few"". It's not the book version of the movie. It contains much more information about the SEALs, their training, and Mr. Denver's personal exploits in battle. If you want to learn more about the SEALs, the book is a Must Read.

I highly recommend both the book and the movie. I personally own both. They are both for me time and money well spent.

First the story line is minimal with the movie primarily driving home the courage, training, high tech equipment of the worlds most elite fighting force based on several missions that comprise the story.  Second the Navy Seal main characters are portrayed by real life active duty Seals.  The less than stellar acting ability of the Seals can be easily excused because the action sequences are so well done they carry the movie.  Also, its easy to see past the acting with men who are so deserving of our respect and gratitude and I feel privileged to see the real people in action.  For me I would not trade better acting for the real thing.

Have watched (too) many NAVY SEALs type shows - this one's good because it's real: SEALs die, something some shows try to avoid
Like the narration story-telling approach and I learnt something about Tecumseh

Watch it once, then watch it with director's commentary and learn how much realism went into the creation of this movie.  Then re-watch it and gain a true understanding that these guys aren't bothered about acting, or getting their parts right, their making sure their drills are performed as they would on mission.

The one scene during a briefing where no script was used is phenomenal and comes off with military precision.  Fantastic movie and highlights the bravery of the Seals and other SF operators around the world.",1361836800,,547,4.787234042553192

4729240,1,B005LAIGYQ,"OK so I respect the armed forces, sacrifices and such but man this movie does them no justice whatsoever. I honesty can't see why it would get anything more than 2 stars max and that's being generous.

The previews looked amazing, i was so excited to see this but man my hopes of a great movie came crashing down soon into wasting my time watching this. The plot is simply horrible and dumb as they try to throw together a few action scenes which start off promising but ultimately fail after the first one. I thought hey i can see through bad acting for a good story and action but man there's no good story or action to try to follow. If you watch the first action scene you will be impressed but it peaks there and you can't help but hate everything to follow.

The acting is horrible, so bad you can't feel any emotions towards the main bro-mance or their families as they go off to fight which really spoils everything. The plot is stupid, no imigination, typical bad guy needs to be stopped in a dumb attempt to cause a disaster. I actually thought there was supposed to be elements of reality here you know!

If you want a good armed forces movie try Tramsformers as this movie does no justice to the men and women who serve and sacrifice to help rid the world of scum. This is just a typical B movie with real people in it and a larger budget. I'm a huge movie fan, I can appreciate flaws here and there and see through them but there's way too much here to forgive. It's true potential is wasted.

Love the idea, the first big scene started so well but...

4729242,2,B005LAIGYQ,"Act of Valor is a refreshingly new and ambitious idea, that takes the stories of active U.S. Marines and turns them into one big story, which is then played out by the very Marines who experienced them. I loved the concept, but this film falls way short of expectations. I believe the purpose of military is the service and protection of our nation, but in Act of Valor the Marines are portrayed as trigger happy Americans. We see the Marines, following up on CIA Intel, going into four different foreign countries, shooting first and asking questions later. Is this really the image of our military that we want to portray to the rest of the world? Regardless of what's real and what's not, these Marines come off as ruthless, with an attitude of 'we're American, we'll do what we want.' As expected, the action scenes were some of the best and most realistic I've ever seen. I would except nothing less, being that the film features men who have been in actual combat and know what it looks like. The acting, also as excepted, was really awful, but for the first time in the twenty month history of this blog I won't blame the actors for it, since after all, they aren't really actors. The action sequences alone more than make up for the bad acting job, but again, I have a real problem with the message this film is sending out to the world. Chronicling the heroism and every day life of a U.S. Marine is admirable, but portraying them like Bruce Willis in Die Hard isn't doing them any favors, in fact it's making an already difficult job harder.",1361491200,,1551,4.523131672597865

4729346,4,B005LAIGYQ,"Incredibly well done. When people rave about this film, they always talk about the heroic nature of the people who do this job. But on a technical level, the way it is shot and edited give it the heartbeat that excites the audience.  Think about the courage of men who are dropped among hostiles, but also think of the courage of people gathering information on the ground without any protection, or those who link up the pieces of intel that make this work, and the tax paying dollars necessary to equip and train these people to do the job they do. They can't do it alone, and the people who stay behind to hold everything else together, keeps it together - as they say, if you don't button everything up before you leave, you will hurt the operation and the men who depend on you.

It is well done, but, ironically, one of the things that makes it interesting causes its one weakness.  Actual Special Forces soldiers are used to play the parts of the SF people in the movie.  They do an amazingly good job of acting, considering that, and they certainly leave nothing to be desired in the many action scenes, but this is the first movie I have ever seen where the bad guys did a better job of acting than the good guys.  :)  That said, the equipment used is the real stuff, and the shooting is done realistically, and the acts of bravery and heroism are not only believable, but true to what we know from our contacts.  The plot is great, and moves right along, and the filming is fantastic.

first off let me say that if you are a person who cries at sad endings don't watch this you will cry and even if you are this person you may still cry the ending tugs at your heat strings

Secondly this is an incredible movie from the action packed moments to the slow moments that lead the story along this is a movie that is for any action fan but also for both fans of the military and their family. The story of these navy seals does not slow down unless it talks about family but as it builds up you can feel the tension in the firefights, and from the insertions. you can see who and how things happen in the navy seal community and how these brothers in arms take care of themselves and their own but the best part is the moments where you see through the eyes of the operator these are tension filled moments fill the movie with a tension that you will enjoy. this is a great movie and i hope that this kind of collboration between the military and hollywood happens again",1359244800,,990,4.15625

The moral ethic held in the movie is awe-inspiring, even though I know people make mistakes.  My heart goes out to those that have to live with the death of their loved ones.

4729427,3,B005LAIGYQ,"I really wanted to love this film about US Navy SEALs, but I was ultimately slightly disappointed and below, I will try to explain more in detail why it happened. This review contains some limited SPOILERS.

To begin with the good stuff, the action scenes in this film were VERY good. There are three major fights in ""Act of valor"" and they are really impressive, filmed in a way as realistic as possible, in a style reminding a little of ""Blackhawk down"". Absolutely nothing to criticize there.

Although not an expert on the military things, considering that US Navy closely collaborated in making of this film ans some real ex-Navy SEALs played in it, I believe that the description of weapons, equipments, vehicles and tactics was as close to the reality as it was possible without revealing too much of professional secrets - and indeed, this film has a feeling of ""real stuff"". Once again, nothing to criticize here.

I also agree with the ideology of this film and its martial message. There are indeed evil people out there who either want to make money of other people's suffering (like drug traffickers) or want to murder other people just because they do not share their beliefs (like islamic extremists) - and if their threat becomes too serious to ignore they must be taken out (killed or captured) by those who defend civilized societies, which means mostly professional soldiers and spies. Period.

However, even with all the above, I didn't enjoy this film as much as I hoped, mostly because of a very weak scenario. Without revealing too much, I must however say that all the intelligence aspects of this film seemed to be expedited in the fastest possible way - whereas in the real world intelligence gathering is an excruciatingly difficult and time consuming task.

Also, for the life of me I can not understand why the criminals (weapons and drug traffickers) were so eager to join with terrorists in the plot against United States. Money is earned to be enjoyed and if one is dead, his fortune is of no use - and being part of a really huge terrorist attack against the world leading superpower offers poor prospects of survival.

Finally I rather didn't like the fact that the leading villain was a Russian converted to islam and connected to Chechnyan rebels - in the real world, Chechen guerillas, even the most extremist, never targeted US interests. Also, maybe by an excess of precautions, no bad guys from radical islamic organisation are Arabs but instead they are all Moros from southern Philippines.

Considering that most of SEALs are played by real ex-SEALs and not by actors, it is hardly fair to criticize their acting and anyway it is not so bad. But there can be no excuses for the scenarist who wrote the dialogs, which are so atrociously boring that in the second part of the film I really hoped that somebody will start shooting, just to not hear them anymore. I ultimately fast forwarded some conversations just because the great final raid.

The ending, on another hand, was pretty moving and I fully agree with its message - we must be grateful to those who labour, suffer and risk their lives so we, simple citizens, can enjoy our life and freedom without fear.

I do not regret that I bought and watched this film, but I definitely didn't enjoy it as much as ""Blackhawk down"" and I do not think I will keep my DVD. Still, it is worth to be watched once, for the great action scenes. Enjoy!",1358726400,,3435,4.692691029900332
4729428,5,B005LAIGYQ,". . . and Act of Valor was just what the doctor ordered. I wasn't always on the sidelines. I did my combat tour in Southeast Asia a long time ago, and I have found most war movies either too intent on shock value, too ""John Wayne"" or just too unbelievable.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ike-Countdown-To-D-Day/dp/B007AL0RZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ike: Countdown To D-Day</a>&nbsp;is my all time favorite, which would indicate my preference towards honesty and thought process. What a treat Valor was! So many scenes that were totally captivating in their believability when held up to the light of what and who I know.

The family scene on the beach was so well thought out, and set a soft undertone to what the viewer knows will be a violent film. Even so, just as others have said, the killing was not promoted to front and center stage. Rather, it was dealt with as it had to be, and then we moved on. The fast boat stuff was amazing! The Gatling Gun rumble was perfect, and that alone brought back such vivid memories of another time in my life.

This is a very watchable movie . . . perhaps a must watch. I just saw Zero Dark Thirty in the theater, and it did not measure up to Act of Valor.

4729516,4,B005LAIGYQ,"I've seen this movie three times now and have enjoyed it each time I've watched it. It's important to note that although following a real group of Seals - although it's created with the fictional plot, the events - to an extent - are everyday reenactments. Picture the civil war reactors meets modern day Hollywood.

I'm going to start off with why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. The plot. Like I said, it's fictional and Hollywood. The Seals have to stop a terrorist from getting tech into the country that can bypass all safety measures we have in place. I didn't research the tech, but it sounded real enough. The problem with the plot is the typical Hollywood style, thin and rushed with no real context, no fault to the ""actors"" and director.

The rest is amazing. The visuals are spectacular and look amazing on blu-ray. The action sequences are breathtaking. The first time I watched it, I literally had a few holy cow moments! You really get a glimpse of the teamwork and effort that goes into each mission. They really do give a glimpse to the out of combat happenings, which for a war movie deserves props. It doesn't romanticize. There are some gory moments, but not terrible - certainly not as bad as most modern war movies.

I would highly recommend at least renting, if not buying this movie. I didn't find this movie to be political or propaganda. I lean heavy to one side of the political spectrum and I never felt like Hollywood was trying to push a message - which is what I like. I watched it to be entertained, and I wasn't let down.

4729594,5,B005LAIGYQ,"The acting is bad.  Let's get that out of the way at the beginning.  There are SEALs, not actors, they aren't going to act well as a rule.

Everything else is awesome.  The fights scenes are amazing, the infiltration scenes even better.  I highly recommend getting it, watching it, then watching it with the director's commentary as you get to hear about the parts that are based on real events.  I hope they make a sequel and with the wars winding down maybe the SEALs will have more free time to work on it.",1357776000,,509,4.361702127659575

4729597,4,B005LAIGYQ,My Son (12) & I Watched this and it was pretty good.  The quality delivered to my TV was not Clear...but we were able to make it thru the movie.  Probably won't order any more flix this route.  Much clearer thru Netflix.  Wasn't a terrible experience but just not for me.  That being said....the Movie was Action Packed and was enjoyed by my Son & I.,1357689600,,350,4.242424242424242

4729638,5,B005LAIGYQ,"An action packed war tale by those who do this for a living. No need to train actors on tactics here. I found the most interesting thing reading the credits. It almost appears to be a film shot by the Navy. It certainly is predictable, but a great action flick showcasing Seal Team tactics.",1357344000,,290,4.388888888888889
4729729,5,B005LAIGYQ,"Judged by the reviews here most audience appreciated this movie both as a tribute to the SEALs and as an entertainment, which is good and important that more people will refer it to their friends and families, more will know about our heroic elites. However, as one of their true admirers who read many books about them, I am obliged to comment that the directors and screenwriters still had not fully told why and how those SEALs are so great, say the hellish training they take and the ideology/philosophy they hold. Anyway, a great movie for all adult civilians despite the bloody yet real combat scenes! Highly recommended!",1357344000,,627,4.814814814814815

4729733,4,B005LAIGYQ,"Acting was poor, it sounded scripted. However, the concept of the movie and battle scenes made up for it. Its a must see, but you must look past the acting ability of the actors.",1357084800,,178,4.264705882352941
4729734,1,B005LAIGYQ,"People please.  This is a tribute movie paying tribute to the very special men who protect our freedom.  It is not a good movie, there is no plot.

4729735,5,B005LAIGYQ,"I don't watch many war movies, but I decided to watch this one because the actors were actual real vets, and I think it's that element that made this movie truly incredible. The movie is very well acted, and very well produced and portrayed the patriotism of our great men and women in the services in a heart tugging way. Well worth the time.",1357084800,,343,4.375
4729736,5,B005LAIGYQ,This movie was amazing.  I believe it gave you real insight into the daily lives of seals.  Another thing that was awesome was the fact that the actors were real seals.  I LOVE THIS MOVIE.,1357084800,,188,4.314285714285714

4729791,5,B005LAIGYQ,"As a member of the US Armed Forces, I sometimes am disgusted at Hollywood's attempt at ""war movies"" and find many of their actors disingenuous.  Not because of a desire for more ""blood and guts"" -- there is certainly enough of that in war and Hollywood.  But because sometimes the story  just needs to be told.  THIS movie, however, was not only incredible for it's cinematography, but knowing they were real special operators made it that much more exciting and enjoyable.

Never forget what your fellow Americans sacrifice for you every day.  Joe Civilian truly has no idea, other than what he sees coming out of Hollywood.  This movie did SEALs and the Armed Forces justice.

Cherish your freedom, and thank a member of the Armed Forces for their sacrifice.",1356998400,,760,4.792307692307692

4729797,5,B005LAIGYQ,"I come from a huge military family, mostly Navy & Army (that makes the annual army navy game very interesting around here, lol) I served & my husband continues to serve. This movie would have been great even if it had not been made with a real Seal team, the fact that it WAS made with a real Navy SEAL Team makes it outstandingly realistic & honest. There are scenes where live rounds are used instead of blanks, where the seals took over & ran the operation as they would in real life. They played themselves so while many civillians criticize the acting, most military personnel know that teams guys in particular don't get Hollywood dramatic during a mission, they stay calm & press on. The time to fall apart is after the mission, not during it. I found this movie to be full of action, real raw honest emotion & the most honest representation of our brave warriors ever put on the big screen. Every person i know in the military who has seen this movie feels the same, the only critisim I hear comes from civillians whose only exposure to the military comes from Hollywood. The movie starts & ends with the reading of a letter written by a seal based on a famous poem by Tecumseh.

The full letter below explains the feeling of the entire movie. Read this & if it makes u feel a sense of honor & strikes a cord within you, this is a movie that u will undoubtably love, if not you are PROBOBLY going to enjoy something else better.

Act of Valor letter (FULL)

 Before my father died, he said the worst thing about growing old was that other men stop seeing you as dangerous...I've always remember that how being dangerous was sacred, a badge of honor. You live your life by a code. An ethos, every man does. It's your shoreline It's what guides you home and trust me you're always trying to get home. Your father was a reader, Churchill of course but also Faulkner and books about Tecumseh, he loved artists who painted people with bodies that looked like boxes, I'd give him hell about that he just say you gotta look harder, Look harder your father would say, I always knew he wasn't just talking about those boxy abstract paintings. There's threats everywhere in a world that's draped in camouflage. Your fathers grand father gave up his life flying a b24 in world war 2, he kept the liberator aloft just long enough for everyone to jump and then he went down with the plane. That's the blood coursing in your veins, Your father was my boss and I was his chief. What we knew about each others traits and our bond as operators. There's a brotherhood between us and we depended on each other more than a family. Tecumseh said although a single twig may break a bundle of twigs is strong.

Our platoon was headed downrange, we had Weimy our sniper he grew up in the middle of the Mojave desert, most excitement he had as a kid was bowling frozen turkeys down the isle at the grocery store.

Ray our comms guy, our radio man. He grew up in east LA gangland. He had a silver star for pulling a wounded teammate out of a freight.

Sonny he was made of grannet, this guy didn't even do push ups because he was afraid his chest was gonna get too big.

Ajay joined the teams late in his 30's he had been a muay thai fighter all his life, before that he grew up dirt poor in Trinidad.

Mikey had 20 years in the teams, as humble as he was. You never even know him, he kept a picture of his wife in his helmet and a lock of her hair in his pocket, quiet as the breeze and finally senior chief miller, couldn't really tell you much about him other than I'd rather take a knife to a gun fight than have to be interrogated by him.

That last night at home you think about how you coulda been a better dad, a better husband, that bedtime story you shoulda read or that anniversary you forgot. You don't expect your family to understand what your doing, You just hope they accept it. When you get home you hope you can pickup right where you left off.

War is a country of will, theres no room for sympathy. If your not willing to give up everything...You've already lost.

Your father was a good man, growing up without him is going be hard its going to hurt. You'll feel alone, out to sea with no shore in sight you'll wonder why me, why him. Remember you have warriors blood in your veins, the code that made your father who he was is the same code that'll make you a man he would admire, respect. Put your pain in a box. Lock it down, like those people in the paintings your father liked we are men made up of boxes, chambers of loss, triumph, of hurt and hope and love. No one is stronger or more dangerous than a man who can harness his emotions, his past. Use it as fuel as ammunition as ink to write the most important letter of YOUR life. Before your father died he asked me to give you this poem by Tecumseh, I told him I'd fold it into a paper aeroplane and in a way...I guess that's what I'm doing, sailing it from him to you.

So live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart. Trouble no one about their religion;respect others in their view, and demand that they respect yours. Love your life, perfect your life, beautify all things in your life. Seek to make your life long and its purpose in the service of your people. Prepare a noble death song for the day when you go over the great divide.

Always give a word or a sign of salute when meeting or passing a friend, even a stranger, when in a lonely place. Show respect to all people and grovel to none.

When you arise in the morning give thanks for the food and for the joy of living. If you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies only in yourself. Abuse no one and no thing, for abuse turns the wise ones to fools and robs the spirit of its vision.

When it comes your time to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with the fear of death, so that when their time comes they weep and pray for a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way. Sing your death song and die like a hero going home.",1356739200,6,6015,4.2264808362369335

4729850,4,B005LAIGYQ,I purchased this for my bf for christmas. We both had never seen it before. I was worried about the first person shooter thing but a few reviews said it was pretty good. So I got it. Great action!,1356652800,,196,4.051282051282051
4729851,5,B005LAIGYQ,"Wow, this was a really emotional picture. It gives the viewer a peek into the world of bad guys vs. the U.S.A military and what can happen when we go after the bad guys in the world to stop a senseless act. Maybe more bad guys need to see this film and maybe they would think twice about messing with the wrong end of the bull. I'm very proud of my country and the people who protect our borders and it's citizens. No one can tell me there is a better place to be on this earth than right here in the United States of America.

4729899,4,B005LAIGYQ,"Bought it for my teenage son. He liked all the military equipment and weapons.  I found the story a bit hard to follow.  The group of SEALs were hard to distinguish from each other when dressed in helmets and armor, so it was hard to know who was doing what, and they were chasing at least 2 different bad guys in several different locations, and they each had their own minions, so it was difficult to keep up with who was who, and who was doing what.  When the ""act of valor"" happens, and there's no lead up to it, so you kind of ignore it as just part of the movie.  When it was over, I thought ""what was the act of valor""?  ""Oh yeah, it was when...""  Good if you like military ""stuff"", the military equipment used was amazing, not so much if you actually want a good story.",1356566400,,777,4.112582781456954

4729901,4,B005LAIGYQ,"I am going to be totally honest here when I say I only saw this movie because I half expected it to be like Discovery channel's Surviving the Cut, which I loved. This movie was not that, but it was still pretty cool. It featured real Navy SEALs  giving a commendable (pun intended) acting performance and had some really great action sequences. The story is your run-of-the-mill terrorist action plot, with America's elite tasked to take them down before they reach the homeland. It ends exactly how you think it will, but that's okay because it's still a really fun film.",1356566400,,572,4.663366336633663

4729957,4,B005LAIGYQ,"Act of Valor is an amazing movie. In this movie the SEALs rescue a CIA operative who has been taken hostage. The intelligence information recovered on the rescue sets the SEALs off on a chase to hunt down terrorists who plan to sneak suicide bombers wearing suicide vests that are unable to be seen by metal detectors in to the United States.

In addition to the amazingly well done intense action, the movie does give viewers a glimpse of the home life of some of the guys in the unit. The only drawback is that the scenes at home aren't long enough. I cared about the two main characters the movie focuses on but not as much as I would have if the characters lives at home were more well developed. The most emotionally intense scenes come at the end of the movie and made me proud that we have Americans who put their lives on the line every single day to keep this country safe.

I found the action scenes very believable. This isn't Rambo type stuff, the movie shows how careful the SEALs operate and try to achieve the goals of the mission with as much stealth and as little risk to American lives as possible. On the other hand, the movie also shows that while special operations teams have access to advanced technology like drones, most of their work still involves them putting their lives on the line in close quarters with the enemy.",1355875200,,1345,4.441295546558704

4730000,1,B005LAIGYQ,"This film has one message, and it is painfully obvious: ""If you're not a SEAL, then you're a piece of ****.""

As a combat veteran of the US Army Airborne Infantry this movie actually offended me. At no point during the film does anyone acknowledge the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of other people in the service fighting to defend our country. Not a single solitary sentence of dialogue that mentions that there is anyone else out there other than the SEALS.

I get it, the SEALS are an elite group and deserve kudos. But I don't think that it is fair to the 18 year old kid on the flight deck working outrageous hours in substandard working conditions to keep our Navy pilots in the air.

Next; the plot, dialogue, and action sequences. God forbid a US Navy SEAL does anything other than a perfect one shot between the eyes headshot on a bad guy. Unrealistic, guy takes an RPG to the chest that doesn't explode but gets up and shrugs it off. It is still a rocket coming at you at high speed, I don't care if you are wearing a plate, that is going to do more than knock you down.

The ending; the ending was taken directly from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and they do not even attempt to disguise it as anything other than that. If you want to see something worth your time to appreciate the men AND women serving our country you should watch Sebastian Junger's ""Restrepo"", or the reality tv show ""Carrier"".

4730064,5,B005LAIGYQ,"It was a while before watching this movie because I had heard some negative things about it, including the short review in the description on this page. They were all wrong and I'm glad I watched it. In fact, it is now one of my favorite military movies ever. Now I have a serious bone to pick with the official review on this page.

Bret Fetzer's review in the description is entirely inaccurate to the point I question whether he was paying attention to the movie at all. He says it is fantasy due to the perfection of the missions, and all of his points to this are invalid. First he says there are no civilian casualties. So? This reviewer clearly has bias against the military by implying that military missions inevitably have civilian casualties. And technically, lots of non-soldier humans are killed in this movie. Not everyone using a gun is considered a soldier, in terms of war, so there are many dead civilians. His second point is that every sniper takes out their target with a single head shot. First, every sniper? There's one. And any sniper worth anything should be able to hit a non-moving target in the head in one shot, that's the entire point to being a sniper. Second, HE MISSED THE MOVING TARGET. The one situation where he COULD miss, he did. And then your point on exploding heads is completely wrong, none of the heads explode. Simply put, there was nothing ""fantasy"" about this movie, in fact that was the point it would seem all along. They wanted it to be less fantasy than other movies.

The one thing Bret said was smart of the movie was avoiding setups and dialogue, except that's what they did throughout the movie and in a fashion that was very important to the whole plot. They spent a lot of time showing off the brotherhood they had with one another and how important their relationships with each other and their families was. While I wouldn't call any of the dialogue subtle, it didn't feel forced either. These guys may not be actors, but that's the entire point. This is real, this stuff happens, and this is how our soldiers feel, act, and live. THAT'S THE POINT TO THE MOVIE. This wasn't just a sincere attempt at showing respect to our military, it was probably the single best film on the subject ever made. I am against war and violence in general, but I admire and am inspired by this movie because of all the things Bret clearly ignored in this movie. Which is most of it, it's obvious he wasn't watching when he reviewed it.",1355184000,,2475,4.522321428571429

4730068,3,B005LAIGYQ,"This movie is hard to review. I opted for middling 3 stars which does not do movie full justice.

Action Scenes - 5 stars. Perhaps the best I have ever seen of modern, small arms warfare. All those scenes had air of authenticity and were gripping. The overall pace of the movie was clearly made for those scenes where things are visual and move quickly.

Plot - 1 star. Plot was between a joke and very bad. Also plot is where movies starts diverging from reality. SEALs do not decide who to whack, SEALs do not have their own intelligence, etc. Movie has neither emotion nor drama - that is how real soldiers go about their business. However a great movie has to have a personal drama. It is a must of the genre. ""Threat to America"" is not personal enough. The terrorist character is not developed at all.

Acting - 1 star. Dialogs were a joke. All dialogs appear to be abbreviated to the point of making no sense.",1355097600,6,915,4.370588235294117

4730156,4,B005LAIGYQ,"After I watched this movie I went online and checked the IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes reviews for it. I was shocked and angered at the stupid, moronic reactions to the movie and that so many had given it a low rating.
It seems like this was driven by people thinking the acting was bad which is absurd. There is no weakness in the acting. It is solid from beginning to end and one could name many hollywood blockbusters that acting inferior to this film.
It also seems like these negative reviews are driven by hollywood elitist movie critics who were trying to read allot of political messages into the movie and saw it as propaganda or a recruiting film. This shows a complete and utter misunderstanding of the movie. The movie was motivated by a sense of patriotism and the desire to honor the men and women who serve at the most elite levels of the military. But it seems many people cannot see that. Such patriotism is lost on them.
Situations like these continue to reinforce the weakening of my faith in humanity and society today.
People have had such absurd reactions to this movie. It just makes me angry. These negative, bizarre off the wall reaction seem quite prevalent among many people and it's just disgusting.

But anyway, back to the movie. It is a realistic, well directed depiction of Navy Seals and the roles they play. It was amazing to see how mobile they are and the advanced technology they use when deploying or extracting from operations. I think some people can't comprehend the realism of the movie because it is not a unrealistic free-wheeling, hyper-active hollywood film that do quite forceful things to stir peoples emotions.
The realism of combat is as absolute as you can get in a movie. The action is portrayed how it would actually occur. Perhaps some people don't know what to do with this. They can't handle the truth or don't want to.
But for any level headed person with even ounce of patriotism and a tolerance for action, this movie should be very enjoyable and moving.

The two main characters are actual NAVY SEAL OPERATORS. The missions are very similar to real world missions that have gone on since GWOT started (Global War on Terror). Make no mistake that Radical Jihadist are trying to enter this country to do harm to you, me and your sons and daughters.

There is no line in the sand, there are no innocent folks, everyone is an infidel to them and they will do EVERYTHING they can to destroy the western world.

This movie, shows what SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMANDO's are doing daily to protect the USA from these folks. As you can see, the problem is a global threat, not just one singular country.

I've been downrange and worked with these ""SPECIAL FEW"" who do this type of work. This movie, by far, is the best depiction of what it means to be a SPECIAL WARFARE FIGHTER in the US MILITARY. It is an HONOR to serve with these men and walk the same hallways with them.

I recommend this movie to EVERY AMERICAN so they can see where Orwell got his quote; ""People sleep peacefully at night because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf."" George Orwell - Yes that is true, I am one of these men.

Please buy the movie, and tell your friends about it.

Thank you for reading.

The acting was average from the SEALs but, give them a break they aren't going to acting school and they aren't the Tom Hanks/ Tom Cruise of our generation. They are strictly trained to fulfill any mission on their plate. I for one really didn't care for the acting.

The fighting scenes were breathtaking because you really get to see similar situation missions that are overseas in Iraq and in Afghanistan. The weapons and explosions that the military are only required to have its good to see how they are actually used and get a sense of what the soldiers go through on a regular basis.

I don't understand the commitment to ""the Mission"" at the expense of everything else. I don't understand the ""brotherhood"" among the Seals. It's a different world from the one I inhabit and I doubt I could give myself to it. But in times of war it is necessary and that is what came home to me while watching this film. We are at war and these men are out there on the front lines sacrificing to keep us safe.

Then the action scenes end, and we get a few minutes of wooden ""actors"" chugging their way through the dialogue the best they can.  There are no actual characters in this movie, just a bunch of people you have no connection to.  They make one guy an expectant father in an effort to give him some resemblance of personhood, but it falls short.

There's a scene in the movie where one of the dudes dies, and the music, cinematography, etc. seem to indicate that it's supposed to be an emotional moment. Didn't work for me.

4730672,5,B005LAIGYQ,"I was raised in a Navy family, attended a school run by the Navy overseas, and still have long time relationships with military friends and family. Many from my high school served in the military and the special forces.

Professionalism, effectiveness and valor are the three terms I would use to describe our service people's performance on a daily basis both in their professional and personal lives.

All of us owe our service people not only a debt of gratitude for protecting us from the tyrants and animals, of which there is a never ending supply, we owe it to them to ensure that the politicians don't short change them on their salary, living conditions, equipment and benefits and divert the funds into various vote buying programs and pork for the connected of both parties. Cell phones for votes while the soldiers are laid off comes to mind.

I thank the makers of this movie for minimizing all of the hot-dog and psycho episodes prevalent in so many military movies and not portraying the officers as disconnected boobs, they are not. The few that are ineffective, incompetent or detached from their reports don't last too long in uniform.

I have never met or known a better class of people than our service members.

While this film focuses on the SEALS, lets not forget the 6,000 plus service members who have died and the 25,000 wounded from all branches of the military in the current conflict with religious fascism, worse than the Nazis if that is possible.

4730722,5,B005LAIGYQ,"Act of Valor is a fantastic movie that uses real tactics and equipment, It started out as a short recruitment film until they realized they could make it a full length feature film. Unlike most Hollywood films this movie is mostly live fire oppose to blank firing guns or flash paper guns. The rifles are real and the bullets are real and the film is great it was certainly refreshing to see that all the vehicles and equipment was real. This film is probably the closest you will get to seeing what SEALs do without going and joining their elite ranks. The plot is very simple: The SEALs are trying to stop a madman. I would certainly like to address a something many people and critics complained about...the acting. Yeah the acting did lack slightly but you have to remember these guys are SEALs not actors. Their trained to be warriors not actors so yeah i expect the lines to be a little forced and uncomfortable. But you know what? no actor could do the combat scenes as well as the real deal did. Because just as SEALs aren't trained to act, actors are not trained in combat tactics. While actors are trained in basic things before starting a war movie quite often their IA (Immediate Action: what a warrior is trained to do when fired upon) is lacking and unsatisfactory. Actors don't have the smoothness like the real SEALs which all comes down to its what SEALs have been trained for.

Overall the acting in my opinion doesn't make the movie lack at all. I think far too many people are getting spoiled with these movies that come out nowadays with intense acting and complex plots (such as inception). The slight awkwardness in the SEALs acting is more than offset by the intense action scenes and the realism of the film and its equipment. This film is a must have for military members/vets/military buffs/guys who want to become SEALs/ or your action junky who likes war movies.

The realism wins this film many points in my book.

As I am not an American, I am not so carried away or influenced by the rather patriotic reviews or jingoism that this movie has received. To review a movie as an art form it must have something going for it to make it have the necessary qualities that make a good movie. It must be well crafted, well structured and well acted that tells a plausible story. To engage military personel such as US Navy Seals, and ask them to act out a some what inplausible story line is simply a badly made James Bond movie and is simply risible. The producers would have been better served if they engaged the documentary format. This movie is  contrived nonsense and I am sure that the Seals deserve better.

That is where these guys are good and it shows.  They may not be good at pretending, but they are great at the real thing.  I would like to see more movies made with real soldiers.  I can do without the real actors, and would prefer the real thing.  Not a movie that an overpaid Hollywood actor could have pulled off as good as these guys did.  And besides, when the Hollywood actors are getting rewarded at the Oscars, Emmy's, whatever, for their pretending. Stop and think for a moment where these guys are for real at that same moment.  If they even receive an award for the real thing, their awards ceremony will not be televised.

But that's ok, because these guys are the real deal and there's no liberal actor BS trying to make some false political statement like Matt ""What's his name"". The SEALs really use sound suppressors and a variety of weapons, all of which is not secret but it looks like maybe they weren't aware that this is the case, so they all use noise making M4's.

This is good because it was very well done from beginning to end (director gets credit), and very well choreographed ACTION!

While there were a few other cool moments in which you felt like you were playing a video game, and some of the gear and tactics were interesting to observe, they really didn't put enough effort into this.  Without enough special effects to make up for it, I was nauseated by the glorification of the wholesome, family-oriented American special ops guys, and the unsophisticated characterization of the shifty-eyed terrorists from hell.

Beyond the believable blowing stuff up bits, and the scenes all over the world, I was most affected by the idea that the things the characters were doing in the movie are real skills of people walking around among us. I repeatedly found myself saying: ""That really happens?!""

I thought it was well-produced and unlike you naysayers, loved that the producer/directors cast real Navy SEALs to portray the characters in the film. I thought the acting was good! It's like you've all never seen an action movie before. The acting may not earn Oscars but the story was made real by the fact that SEALs were the ones doing it.

That scene where the SEALs disappear into the water, then one catches the bad guy as he's shot by a sniper so there isn't a splash in the water? Chills. That's talent, boys.

Most professional critics appear to despise the country that nurtured them in the utmost comfort. I imagine that most of those critics would be either cheering for the terrorists or wanting to sit down with them and ask them why they hate us so much. I say ""us"" because the Australian armed services, and in particular, the elite Special Air Services Regiment (SAS), work closely with the US armed services in combat and we are equally hated by the jihadists. Ignore the claimed absence of adequate character development. This movie is not primarily about character development, although we learn enough about the main characters to feel for their hurt and the hurt to their families when we lose them. There is a great deal of heart-stopping action and we are placed right in the middle of it. We learn that there is a special bond between those in our armed services who risk their lives on our behalf. Many civilians must find it difficult to understand how soldiers could sacrifice their own lives by throwing themselves on a hand grenade to protect their comrades from certain death, but I can assure them that it has happened. It is not a concoction of the film-makers. Highly recommended to all who enjoy a top action film",1347408000,,1375,4.733333333333333

4731181,5,B005LAIGYQ,"An exceptionally great film. Rivetingly intense; for it's depiction of modern warfare (by any standard). As exceptional as any thing I've ever seen as far as amazing choreography and top notch cinematography is concerned. Story's also quite engrossing; nothing about Act Of Valor smacks of indifference or lack of respect for the subject matter. So far as war movie's go; I'd even say monumental. ""Nobility grows from contained emotion..."" (G.Braque)  True to form, this is a soldiers story told, but withholding all (the usual) sappy overtone typically laced into most Hollywood character casts. The pathos of thespians is (almost) absent here and I'm not missing it. Actors who know nothing of the belief systems which propel barrel chested freedom fighters (such as these Navy S.E.A.L.'s) into harms way intent upon showing any enemy a sound defeat, men who train harder than most armies in the world will ever train, drill or fight.

As a tribute to America's S.E.A.L.teams this picture (in my opinion) has done these men (and their families) PROUD. In memorial to these fallen Warriors (and as a token of gratitude to those who still serve); I'd say Act Of Valor stands alone as a crowning achievement of cinematic excellence within the genre. Poignant, enduring, exquisite in it's meticulous detail, uncommonly authentic and accurate in many aspects while still constituting a recognizably fast paced piece of (fictional) entertainment ; although-clearly: 'just a movie' , I'd say Act Of Valor is still pretty much just about as close as your going to get to a front row seat ringside along a 'real life' S.E.A.L. Team (behind the scenes or in action) short of making it through BUDS (training) and shoving off for active duty far-off somewhere 'down range' where the bullets are real. This thing has a pulse of it's own and two boots firmly planted on hallowed ground (straight up and down) front right and center...Five Stars. This is 'the real deal Holyfield'.

One thing I can say with absolute certainty; the film provoked a strong sense of personal pride in me ...'to be an American' and pride in the S.E.A.L.s themselves, it compelled me to think about the S.E.A.L.Teams (and their families), especially the ones that must live on now without a loved one present; and of the wounded Warriors who's fight to maintain (recover) in dignity is a challenge beyond all comprehension.
To the actors, the film makers, the producers and the writers I'd have to say: 'well done' ...indeed, this is beyond entertainment; 'compelling' is the only word. Spectacular, entertaining, authentic & compelling. Act Of Valor is just that... an act of valor.

4731444,5,B005LAIGYQ,"While perusing Instant Video on my PS3 this weekend I saw two movies that I thought would be cool. So on Friday night we did&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battleship/dp/B008N1LL42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battleship</a>&nbsp;and on Saturday we did Act of Valor. And what a difference! With one you get suckered by stupidness and with the other you get captivated by awesomeness.

Director Peter Berg recently did an excellent superhero movie with Will Smith called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hancock/dp/B001KB5UZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hancock</a>. So when I saw that Berg would be at the helm of Hasbro's Battleship, based on the trailers, I thought we'd get a cool military movie that focused on the Navy and how it would handle an alien invasion. However, what Berg delivered with Battleship was a hokey, corny, unrealistic dud. I almost walked out of my own home theater.

On the other hand, fledgling Directors Mike McCoy & Scott Waugh come up with the unique concept of casting a group of real Navy SEALs in a story about fighting terrorists, and they deliver a powerful, realistic, emotional thrill ride of a military film.

So if we break out some of the important elements of both films, let's see how they fare against each other:

Battleship Story: 1 star - A cool Sci-fi/military concept turned into silliness by goofball, slow-moving side stories and disastrous attempts at humor.
Act of Valor Story: 5 stars - A serious, action packed military film based on true events of the heroism of US soldiers that have to rescue an abducted op and take out a terrorist.

Battleship Acting Talent: 2 stars - Taylor Kitsch (John Carter), Alexander Skarsgrd (True Blood) and Rihanna (Really? Rihanna???) corn up the screen with unbelievable portrayals of men and women who fight for our country.
Act of Valor Acting Talent: 5 stars - U.S. Navy SEALs and U.S. Navy Special Warfare Combatant Crewmen show audiences their stripes and make you think that your watching real life Black Ops events captured on camera.

Battleship Action: 3 stars - When the actors aren't hamming up the screen, the action is not bad, but unfortunately there's way too much hamming up the screen.
Act of Valor Action: 5 stars - Even the short amount of time at the beginning of the movie that is spent introducing you to the heroes that will star in the film moves along due to the underlying tone of something big about to happen. Then when the real action starts, it's intense.

Battleship FX: 3 stars - Okay, Battleship's FX weren't bad, but even the main alien craft had a hokeyness to it as it looked like some kind of Transformer-bot instead of a lean, mean, alien fighting machine.
Act of Valor FX: 4 stars - Act of Valor is not an FX movie, but the use of current battlefield technology is awesome to observe in action.

Average stars for Battleship: 2.25
Average stars for Act of Valor: 4.75

Hands down: If you've not had the opportunity to see either of these movies and you're here looking for something to order on Instant Video (or put into you DVD player), stay away from Battleship and add Act of Valor to your cart/queue.",1346716800,,3216,5.098859315589354

It was really hard for me to watch because I struggle with watching anyone get hurt, but I come away from this amazingly executed film with total awe, respect, and gratitude for the men that have trained and sacrificed for the protection of our nation.

I am also angered when I remember how our president took credit for the Seal's team work that took out Bin Laden and then only a month later dismissed our military as non-essential personnel who would not be paid should the debt-ceiling not be raised. ( August 2011)

Now, when the Seals are expressing concern about leaks of classified information in order to make Obama look 'good' BO responded by saying that he doesn't take the Navy Seals seriously.

Our men and women in our military and our Navy Seals represent the best that this nation has to offer, and they deserve more respect from our president.

You can certainly feel the differences between the ""hollywood actors"" and the ""active duty actors"" which certainly lends to the realism effect but robs the movie of a little bit of continuity.

The action scenes are well done, technically correct, and gripping, and the plot is moderately interesting and creative. But they are interspersed with a totally superficial and glib portrayal of the lives of soldiers and their families, with no real character development or interesting stories. The WWII films that the likes of Bogart and Wayne did are much better are bringing the trials and tribulations of military folks to life. The characters in this film are total cliches, and the tear-jerking is over the top. As a result, the movie is confused, trite, and not worth watching IMHO.",1345161600,4,815,4.666666666666667

The characters were convincing without stardom and that for me was a real breath of fresh-air.

Only a few films bring the intensity to the screen like ""Act Of Valor.""  ""Saving Private Ryan"" was of course on a grander scale (WWII) and ""We Were Soldiers"" (Vietnam War).

4731565,5,B005LAIGYQ,"Okay, everybody.  Let's just get one thing out of the way.  Did anybody SERIOUSLY went to see this movie for the intriguing plot, the complex character development, and the stupendous acting chops?  I hate to say this, but if you did, you're delusional!

Just watch the trailer.  Most trailers advertise exciting plot, character development, suspense, blah, blah, blah.  This one blatantly claimed that the whole point was that the movie features REAL Navy SEALs.  What does that say to you?

Having said all of that, I will be fair and state for the record that, yes, it is now a fact that Navy SEALs cannot act for their life.  But if you think about it, wouldn't you be kind of worried if real SEALs actually CAN act?  What does that say about what they're doing with their time?

Yes, one does have to be somewhat familiar with the SpecOps community, and the military in general, to understand all the dialogue.  But come on!  People can have an entire conversation with most military personnel in nothing but acronyms...and we're not even counting the military elite!

At the end of the day, I was promised real Navy SEALs.  They delivered on their promise because all signs point to the fact that those guys are the real deal, not a bunch of professional actors posing and pretending.  Ergo, I'm perfectly happy with what I got.  OMG!  For once, we get to see the Teams do their real stuff, not some Hollywood fairy-land make-believe.  What more do you people want?

BTW:  I do feel a little bit jibbed because I thought we were promised EIGHT SEALs.  Well, I only counted seven.  What happened to the eight one?  Oh wait, I forgot.  He's probably been shipped off to Afghanistan to get shot at.",1344902400,,1701,4.62751677852349

Even a soldier wouldn't be interested in wasting his/her time with watching a real life soldier cleaning their M4 or checking their CR123 batteries. The director and producers took the action scenes because god forbid action heroes don't actually use the restroom and real life soldiers don't share their feelings. You sometimes have to be a stone cold savage to not hesitate to do your job. It's hard for the cubicle jockey to understand why the actor didn't show more emotion or character. It's because if they did and questioned why the hell they did what they did they might hesitate and hurt the guys in the stick they were serving with.  This movie is but a glimpse of the world of pain and sacrifice that these people (and my father) gave/give so we the world can be as peaceful as it is.

This movie gives the viewer just a taste of what goes on in the life of a Navy Seal, and what his family has to endure while he is away. Some other reviewers have stated the acting in this movie is bad.  I would like to bring to everyones attention that the ""actors"" who were portraying these Seals were actual NAVY SEALS - men who train to defend and protect our country and everyone in it, not to ACT.  Please keep this fact in mind while watching this movie.  If you do not believe this fact, then take a moment to watch the credits at the end.  And when you do, make sure you read the name of each and every Navy Seal listed who made the ultimate sacrifice since 9/11,  giving his life so you and I can enjoy ours.

4731683,3,B005LAIGYQ,"First of all, this is just a movie review. I watched this with an old friend in the streaming version. One of us having been in the military and me having helped manufacture and sell many of the items that went ""boom"" in this movie made us both interested in the project. There were no subtitles on the streaming video and despite us both having a lot of familiarity with general military jargon, subtitles are a ""must"" unless you are involved in special operations. If the DVD does not come with some kind of basic ""jargon - translator"", there are just some things that will keep you asking, ""What does that mean?""

Second, the film style was largely like a first-person shooter video game, where you are looking through weapon sites. If you love that kind of video game, and love explosions and firefights, you will enjoy large parts of this movie.

SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW:
The place where this movie bogs down was in the story. To me, it was entirely too predictable. For example, my friend and I looked at one another as soon as one of the SEAL characters, played by a real SEAL, was revealed to be expecting his first child with his lovely wife, and said, ""He's toast,"" because that has been a cliche of so many war movies for 50 or 60 years at least.

One of the keys of great drama is that a movie should make us ""care"" about the characters. We care about these characters -- real Naval personnel and SEALS because we should care -- not because we really care about these characters. We are given ""thumbnail"" sketches of what should have been told another way. For example, one character relates how depressed his ""old man"" was when he realized ""he was no longer dangerous."" What a great opportunity to flash-back to the actual scene and get real impact! Instead, it is related as a second-hand memory and loses what could have been thoughtful character development.

Not to disparage the efforts of the SEAL and Naval personnel cast, but I never had enough of any one character to develope a real impression of him (or her). I blame the writer(s) for this or even remember their names. No time was really spent SHOWING US why these men, or any men, become SEALS. No time was spent SHOWING US the real impact this career choice has on their family life. No time was spent telling us what the ""life of a SEAL"" outside of combat is like. For example, how are rotations and assignments handled? No time was spent showing us what makes a man choose SEALS . . .as opposed to Special Forces . . .as opposed to Force Recon Marines.

I know from several close friends who have served with or worked with SEALS what the real price these people often pay for their career choice. This is emphatically NOT being in the regular military. As an American, it seems to me that a proper treatment of this important subject would have exposed us to an understanding of what the real cost (not merely paid in blood) is.

We get plenty of firefights, plenty of exciting technology in infiltrations and ""exfiltrations"", and plenty of certified-charicature heroes and bad-guys.

The most interesting ""bad guy"" was the Russian (Russian bad-guy! What are the odds?) Christos. He could have been a really interesting character with a little development.

RECOMMENDATION:
(1) If you want to see how real SEALs talk, fight, and serve on missions, by all means see this movie.
(2) If you want a real story deeper than a comic book, this will disappoint. I really enjoyed ""The Heart and The Fist"" -- a superb book on what motivated on man to become a SEAL officer.

I have a old friend, and two of her sons have become SEALS. I haven't met them or talked to them, but this gave me very little insight into what their lives, other that shooting people, rescuing people, or blowing stuff up, are like.

4731742,5,B005LAIGYQ,"I just watched this movie last night and I loved it.  There's a lot of criticism of the acting and a lot of talk that the guys were emotionless, but I don't think people realize how realistic this was.  I think the guys showed emotion the way they actually do, because it's them, being themselves.  I realize people have become used to these amazing dramatic renderings of emotion as portrayed by professional actors, and yes, those portrayals are more polished and less awkward to watch.

However, having served many years myself and having worked, on occasion, with spec ops guys in both the Army and Navy, I can tell you that the way they are in real life is not perfect emotional rendering.  They actually have to shut it down, and that is pretty much what it looks like from the outside.  These guys are great at what they do, but what they do is not acting.  I've been around some pretty intense operational moments, farewells before deployment, etc., and it doesn't look like what you would expect it to.  There is a lot of awkwardness, a lot of stuffed emotions. And operators in the spec ops world ARE absolutely, ridiculously calm (some might say emotionless) in extremely intense situations. For real.  It's NOT Hollywood.  It's also not some fabulously beautiful man baring his soul and letting you see just how much he's going to miss you.  It's things only his wife would know that show how he feels, but it doesn't look like what you'd expect necessarily.

The scenes when they are planning the ops seem a little stilted, but not as much as you would think.  Dialogue in these meetings doesn't go down like something from one of the Bourne movies.  People don't actually talk like that in real life.  I think this was so authentic and honest, and people are so conditioned to seeing the cinematic version of events, they don't stop to think:  have I ever had a conversation at work or with my significant other that sounded that perfectly timed, that cool, whatever?  Nope.  Not really.  Not only that, the action is all real, and a lot of the bullets are real, and for people who don't get how intense and incredible that is, there's nothing anyone could possibly say to you to give you the proper perspective.  You'd have to go to a live range and live it for yourself.  It's a great movie, precisely because it's so real. I have no idea what all the negativity is about.

People need to get this:  the reason we haven't had another 9/11 since 2001 ISN'T because there haven't been any more attempts.  It's because our military has been on watch and prevented them.  Doing just exactly the kinds of things you see in the movie.  And how they come off as actors is irrelevant.  I saw a review online that said the acting was so bad, the SEALs deserved better, to show them as they really are.  I laughed.  These guys ARE showing you how they really are, it's just not as set perfect as everyone wants to believe.  They had daily input into the script, and wouldn't say a line if it wasn't something they'd actually say.  The review also had issues with the interrogator, which I thought was also funny, because the interrogator is the real deal, and that is what he does, and how he does it, for a living, every day.  How many people has the reviewer seen interrogated in real life, I wonder?

I imagine everyone whose real story has been brought to film has felt inside like they really looked good with that actress or actor portraying them, because they know it wasn't that polished in real life.  This is the real deal.  All those who are anti-military and who love to hate what the military does are going to find fault with this movie because it is completely unapologetic and it doesn't try to be Hollywood.  It shows you just how much our guys have to do to neutralize threats.  These are also the people who want to believe that threats only exist if we provoke them, and they would be terrified if they knew just how many bad guys are plotting against us every day, and would happily dispense with any of us in reaching their goals, in the most horrifying and gruesome ways possible.  Anyone who is caught up in grading the quality of acting from an artistic and theatrical perspective will also be disappointed, but if you can let yourself in on the secret that this is very much how things go down in the real world, you might actually enjoy it.  The filmmaking is outstanding and the story is a fictional portrayal of a real-world situation that absolutely COULD happen.  This movie rocks, and I salute the film makers and especially men who made it, as well as all their brothers and sisters in arms.

The commando missions at times reminded me of the ""Call of Duty"" video games and it's no accident this was partly marketed through the ""Battlefield 3"" video game.

Real Navy SEALS were used in this film though their names were obviously kept secret.
It was felt by some of the creators that the real deal was needed to properly portray them. Interesting that Tecumseh, an enemy of Americans, was quoted at the end of this film not so much for him being an enemy but he's unknown to most Americans. Still glad he came up.

4732005,5,B005LAIGYQ,"This is undoubtedly the best movie I have ever seen.  The principal characters are active duty Navy Seals and a Navy intelligence officer.  Only a couple of fairly well known actors play other prominent roles.  Be sure to watch the directors comments - they add so much to the background of this film.  Most of the shooting is live fire, the Seals did much of the dialog without any script, personal scenes such as the beach party were their actual families.  Each ""Act of Valor"" shown actually happened and were woven into the story line written for this movie.  These guys are the best that America has and no one should miss this opportunity to see what they do.

Another shameless plug for the Seals - buy Marcus Luttrell's ""Lone Survivor"" about the 2005 Seal Team 10's fateful mission in the Afghanistan Hindu Kush and those who lost their lives trying to same him.  Unforgettable. IBSN-13: 978-0-316-06760-7

4732009,3,B005LAIGYQ,"The concept for the film was based in realism, yet the director seemed it needed more than a dash of Hollywood schtick in order to sell the story successfully; I disagree. The film was technically well made and it was very interesting to see a new perspective on how the SEAL teams communicate and depend on one another, but I think the effect would have been much more powerful had the tone of the film stayed within a documentary or ultra-realistic style. When the characters stopped and tried to act like ""actors"" and not just like themselves, it really shocked me out of the environment I am sure the director intended for the audience. There are moments, especially during the action portions of the film, where I can really sense what the director wanted and it works really well, but then we cut to an unneeded dramatic scene in order to up the tension and life doesn't happen that way. The real SEAL team members don't get to peak into the motivations of their targets the way the audience gets to, I felt I was cheating in places. I wanted to see ONLY what the SEAL team members would have, somewhat like Paranormal activity was filmed. Perhaps it was my own fault for expecting too much or expecting what I would have done with the film instead, but that's that.

While I disagree with most of the dramatic choices the director made in an effort to sell the film to audiences, I appreciate the chance that was taken on this film, though overall poorly executed in my opinion. All in all, a fine action film with wooden ""dramatic"" performances interspersed throughout the picture in order to add depth to something most of the ticket paying audience was already bought into.

4732108,5,B005LAIGYQ,"First of all I'd like to say what this film is; a tribute film. This movie seeks to pay tribute to the US Navy SEALs and servicemen and women. Those who cry that the film is too patriotic or serves as a recruitment tool don't seem to understand the goal of this film. Again it is a tribute film and to that extent it hugely succeeds, it is not a film that will be winning any Academy Awards due to it's stiff acting and somewhat typical plot but I didn't watch it for all that. I wanted a look at our SEALs in action and I walked away extremely satisfied.

Also, for those saying that this film will brainwash youngsters into joining SEALs or military I'd suggest you think again. BUD/s (Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL or boot camp for SEALs) has a drop out rate of typically 70% to even 90%. Statistically speaking everyone who tries to become SEALs won't even make it. It takes an individual of extreme mental and physical endurance to complete BUD/s and the ability to break all barriers within your way. Allow youngsters to make decisions for themselves and be satisfied with whatever decision they ultimately make, any mistake they make they will learn firsthand and hopefully never repeat again.

I loved this film for the action (the best I've ever seen!). The scene at the end made me tear up in the theater and I found this film hitting very close to home. Know what you want out of a movie and understand what type of film you're about to watch. For those who love military films like We Were Soldliers, Band of Brothers, The Pacific, Flags of our Fathers this film won't disappoint.

4732113,5,B005LAIGYQ,"""Act of Valor"", at face value, is an exciting and well made action movie that stands well on its own, but take into consideration that it was made with active duty SEALs (with support of the military) and you get a very realistic look at the men and families that make daily sacrifices to protect the USA.

No plot spoilers from me; the movie centers on the men comprising a Navy SEAL Team, the families and commitments they leave behind when deploying, and their mission to stop a terrorist plot from being carried out on US soil. The plot feels a lot like a good Tom Clancy story (he was involved in the making of the movie). The acting during the drama scenes was fairly stiff but really came alive when moving into the action scenes, as might be expected. The cinematography is actually quite good, with a lot of impressive shots of the Navy's biggest and best hardware (aircraft carriers, submarines, fighters, and helicopters).

This is a movie I will be watching again in the near future.

Highly Recommended!

4732166,4,B005LAIGYQ,"The movie is about the work that the Navy SEALS do to keep our country safe from outside threats. The principle actors aren't actors at all, but are actual Navy SEALS. I think that gives it a sense of realism that can't be faked by actors who do a week or two at boot camp as research. I heard about the criticism beforehand by those who thought the acting was horrible, but I didn't find it distracting at all. I am used to watching Hollywood actors and THEY can't act, so compared to that, I thought these guys held their own pretty well. :)

There were several different plots that highlighted the danger that our country constantly faces and the highly specialized work that these guys do. The film showed a lot of different angles like how these guys have real lives with real wives and kids. They SACRIFICE to do this. They aren't just killing machines. The film also showed that people get killed in really horrible ways. It didn't dwell on any of these types of things. It wasn't political and it didn't make judgments. It just showed it like it is. It's up to the viewer to draw their own conclusions. In that way, it wasn't a Hollywood flick at all- which was refreshing.

During the mission sequences the actors are comfortable and the language seems to flow (probably because it is more familiar); however in the non-mission sections conversations seem very stilted, to the point where it was a bit distracting.

Everybody, buy this film!! OK. It doesn't, but even if it sucked these SEALS deserve every dollar and more. So, BUY THIS FILM!!

So, honor them. Buy and watch this film. It is money well spent.

4732171,5,B005LAIGYQ,"This movie might be the best possible film tribute to the Americans fighting in the current conflicts. It is a collection of action scenes based on real operations, tied together by a fictional story, performed by real life warriors. As a result, you experience the most realistic modern battle scenes I have ever seen in the movies. Most war movies have at least a few scenes where the hero defies the laws of physics in accordance with some director's delusional fantasy of how combat should be. The action scenes in ""Act of Valor"" rely on the real skills and capabilities of Navy Seals to impress the audience rather hollywood fiction.
Most negative reviews comment on the poor acting. Sure, actors would have done a better job reading the script, but they could not have performed the action scenes period, and that is what this movie is about.
Another common criticism is the story. As was mentioned earlier, this movie is a collection of real life operations. The writers basically had to tie together unrelated true short stories into one series of connected events. Under the circumstances, I think the fictional story achieved the goal. To try and make the story more involved, (character development, ect.) or to have strayed further from the true stories would have detracted from the movie's focus.
A lot of people also seem to be offended by the patriotism of this movie, or accuse it of being a shameless recruiting film. Those people are confusing the act of honoring a profession and a set of values with propaganda. If you do not share those values, this movie will not change your mind, nor is that it's purpose. For those who do, they will enjoy seeing the their values and the men who follow them being honored.
A few other criticisms:
""The violence corrupts our youth""- It's rated R, if you can't control your youth, don't blame an adult movie. Also, I would argue that ""reality"" TV is much more corrupting.
""Filipinos are portrayed as Muslim villains but everyone knows filipinos are Catholic""- There are plenty of Muslim Filipinos and some of them are extremist terrorists. Also, they are not the central villain.
There are plenty of Hollywood War dramas out there so if you are looking for special effects and big name actors, Act of Valor is not it. If you want to see real life Navy Seals doing what hollywood can't, this one is in a league of it's own.",1342656000,,2379,4.734939759036145

4732225,4,B005LAIGYQ,"I'm quick to admit that I love playing first-person shooter video games, as well as watching shoot `em up action flicks. I grew up with Rambo and Medal of Honor. Do I support war or condone acts of violence? No (well, often on the fence about the former). I don't know what it is about hardcore action sprinkled with bloody violence that gives some of us an adrenaline rush, but one thing's for sure is that it doesn't always translate to our real world desires. Where am I going with this and what's the point? The film Act of Valor is an up close and personal dramatized encounter with real-life Navy SEALs, a high body count, and some of the most realistic combat effects I've seen. I enjoyed this film due in great part to the action, as will many viewers of this film, and I don't see why that has to be a bad thing.

Don't get me wrong, I, like many people, look for more than cheap thrills with movies. But I see nothing wrong with a nice adrenaline filled action movie from time to time. Act of Valor is a great example of such a film. It's got a fairly standard terrorist-driven storyline, lots of gunplay and tactical action complete with first-person perspectives that put the viewer right in the middle of the action. It's clear that the SEALs weren't trained in classical acting when forced to perform dramatic dialog, which I forgave knowing this fact from the beginning, but in the tactical scenarios it's clear they are the real deal. The SEALs don't give off the presence of hulking action stars, but rather impose a more controlled, modest demeanor.

Now I may be making this sound like a no-holds-barred shoot-everything blow-stuff-up flick, but that would do this film injustice. After all, this film is centered around a group of individuals whom represent some of our nations greatest heroes. It is said that the film originally was meant to be a recruitment film for the Navy. Had I seen such a recruitment film when I was in high school, I may be in a different career. Not only does the film depict guys that can kick some serious butt and pull off life-saving missions against incredible odds, but it also shows respectable characters that truly believe in what they are doing and care for their team as they would family while at the same time risking their lives for people they've never met.

The film does what many of its kind have a hard time doing, and that is putting meaning behind the action. While the story isn't anything spectacular, the feelings of patriotism, heroism, and camaraderie feel authentic and successfully translate to the real world. In other words, the film doesn't make the gamer inside you want to shoot at the bad guys, but it makes you want to shoot at the bad guys while saving someone's life and perhaps even an entire population. The film also gives the viewer the realization, mainly by casting real life SEALs such as leads Dave and Rorke, that these people are among us everywhere we go. That itself is a pretty big eye-opener.

A lot of people are going to hate on this film for being too violent, pro-American, etc. and for it's other faults such as a fairly standard storyline and weak dramatic acting. Everyone is entitled to their opinion of course, and in some cases I would agree with some of those opinions. However, I believe that sometimes people are too serious when it comes to movies. Why does one have to agree with everything a movie says or does to enjoy it? While Act of Valor may have set out to enlighten, inspire, and promote, that doesn't mean it has to have those effects on you to appreciate it. I personally welcomed such an authentic feeling action flick packed with purpose that still satisfied the FPS fan inside me.

The factors keeping me from calling this a perfect action film would be that I would have loved to have gotten to know the characters outside of combat (perhaps the filmmakers wanted to limit the amount of dramatic acting that would have been required to achieve this?). The film certainly could have used improvement in some of these areas. The choice to cast the real-life SEALs did indeed add that level of authenticity where it counted, but detracted from the overall cinematic quality. Nonetheless, I enjoyed enjoyed Act of Valor and felt like I got a good insight into a very exclusive team that serves our country while simultaneously being entertained.

Let me start off by saying the action is great, which is its main purpose of showing off US seals. Overall, I think the action was a bit too much. Basically, what happened is the story got drowned out in the all that fighting.

The story in any case did not make sense, a rich Russian Jewish drug smuggler who is a nasty person who tortures people, is helping an old friend who is somehow related to Chechnya. Why should this drug dealer do something like this is not explained leaving me thinking the story is stupid. Furthermore, his friend is a converted Muslim who for some reason wants to commit terrorism in the U.S. Why? A Chechnyan's enemy is not the US but Russia. Chechnya would see the US as an ally against Russia. Surely, it would make more sense for this plot to become a movie of Russian Seals.

Another problem with the story, is that it is obvious from almost as soon as we see the scene with the coming baby which seal will die. As such when he does die, we are robbed of the tragedy as its expected.

It is also full of patriotic fever. Which maybe off-putting to some people.

The acting varies from very good, for example, Alex Veadov to very poor. Probably, as many of the actors were picked for their ability to do action then their acting ability.

The characters because the story is so poor, do not come out well.

Overall, this is another story that the writers let us down.

Update: Since the Boston bombing, if I wrote this now, I would reconsider my comments about a terrorist from Chechnya wanting to commit terrorism in the U.S.",1342483200,2,1580,4.424137931034482

I have a lot of respect and admiration for the SEALS and every other member or our Military/Armed Forces. However, this movie goes overboard in many things (plot, ""acting"", etc) to the point where I think it should be advertised as something other than a movie.",1342396800,19,517,4.942528735632184
4732231,5,B005LAIGYQ,"""Act of Valor"" is a great military movie starring actors and real-life Navy SEALS.  Because of this some of the acting is a little wooden but to me, this did not detract too much from the movie.  I knew before I started watching that there were non-actors in the film and I was more interested in the story itself, based on real-life happenings that the SEALS participated in.

It showed the camaraderie that military personnel form between each other, as they depend on each other, risking their lives together. It also shows the heartbreak of war and that the families waiting at home sacrifice just like our soldiers do.

I thought the movie felt very realistic.  Be aware this is a military action film.  There is violence, scenes of torture, some language.

This probably isn't my favorite military action film.

I took the movie with me along with several other items which also proved to be a wonderful way to spend a few days, especially with Tropical Storm Debby.  My brother-in-law is a retired Navy SEAL.  He opted to invite his son and their daughter-in-law, just a few miles down the beach, to join us for the movie. We watched it twice.

4732353,4,B005LAIGYQ,"I bought this as a source of inspiration because I also shoot video with a DSLR. Granted, the production crew had much finer lenses and stabilizing kits than I do, so it's not as if I will be shooting the sequel, but nevertheless it's flatout amazing what the crew accomplished with these cameras. One couldn't tell that no Arri's or RED's were used to shoot this movie. From a reference material perspective, this is a great buy. Yeah, I'm a geek.

I took down one star in the rating because the extra features felt dumbed down and forced. The interviews didn't have enough cut scenes and ended up being dry one-on-one chats with the soldiers. Enlightening? Sure. Entertaining? Not for me. The ""making of"" didn't go into any technical discussion about the actual production. In fact, all the extras were basically modified versions of trailers and promotions. So boo to the production team for this.

The plot is forgettable, and you could certainly find better action movies elsewhere. For a DSLR video shooter like me, it was something that had to be bought as much as a Bruce Willis fan has to buy the Die Hard series or a Harrison Ford fan buying the Indy Jones series.",1341964800,,1174,4.666666666666667

On the other hand, let's deal with reality here and specifically review the actual movie and not the content of the movie.

2.  Bottomline, this film's main downfall is the lame - stiff - unnatural acting.  The cinematography is good, the writing is fairly good, the storyline is good enough for me (I'm a fairly easy guy to please), but the acting is just terrible.  I mean, as you're watching this film, you're just completely conscious that these guys are trying to act natural, but that they're just not pulling it off.  With the above being said, with anyone with a military interest or background, it's a no brainer to watch the film just to see what the hype is about,  but a one time view is going to suffice for most.",1341705600,5,904,4.4969325153374236

I bought the Blu-Ray version and advise that you watch the special features and interviews before the feature film if you do the same. If you are a person who likes commentary tracks, the directors really break down the movie scene-for-scene, talking about the hardships and fun they had in filming. They really opened up the movie to me. To them, this wasn't just a movie, this was a labor of love.

The low budget aspect of the movie does show through; they are NOT actors, there are places where the script does NOT flow well, and there is too much jargon. Two of these three are what make the movie so real.

The ""R"" rating comes from the blood-splatter caused by instant take-down head shots, scenes of torture, and the occasional cuss word.

For parents who want their children to see the movie, I would advise them to see the movie first and judge their children on an individual basis and then watch the movie with them.

I love this movie because it is very real as to what Seals, Delta, Rangers and other Special OPS do mission wise.  I am very proud of them and their families.

The tactics, dialogue and equipment are tight.  Even some of those who have or currently are serving, do not always get it nor will they know matter how it is described to them.

Why?  I wonder.  The plot is skimpy, but it WORKS, and it just flies by.  It's hard to talk about the acting, when most of it is done by real SEALs firing weapons.

Perhaps it just comes down to gratitude, that America still has magnificent men like the SEALs, who keep the country safe by frequently putting their lives on the line.

It's NON-STOP action from beginning to end, my wife commented that it seemed like 3 movies rolled into one.

To be clear, when this movie was OK'd by the Navy several years ago, it was to assist recruiting. Call it a ""Top Gun"" for the Navy SEALs.

The storyline was very predictable in one area and I knew where it would end up as soon as I saw a few scenes that were obvious set ups for where it was headed, but that was a fairly small part of the movie.

I could spend a weekend watching the History Channel and learn about Navy Seals than I did from this movie.

I will say that I came away with a better understanding of how these missions are carried out logistically, though you don't get a good sense of the time put into preparations for these missions.

While the movie itself is fiction, I know many of the scenes are based on real life events from various missions during the war on terror because I remember reading about them in the paper or doing researching after having seen the movie.

4732829,1,B005LAIGYQ,"***Spoiler Alert***

Though the plot is fiction, there are obvious undertones paralleling the more well-known conflict between al-Qaeda terrorists and the U.S. rather than the ""enemies"" who were depicted. And following the legacy of The Green Berets movie, America was portrayed as morally perfect and organized while the opposition was portrayed as heartless and scattered. Everything in this movie was unrealistically favorable toward pro-American/anti-opposition propaganda--even the musical scores. The juxtapositions of the opposing interrogation methods were one of the most unrealistically-biased portrayals. The U.S. interrogated a drug smuggler by having a mildly-heated discussion in which the interrogator was trying to reason with the drug smuggler by explaining the ""reality"" of the situation. The drug smuggler quickly cracked. Meanwhile the CIA spy was interrogated by the opposition who were using savage means that included drilling through the CIA agent's hands. She never cracked.

The drug smuggler was working with an old friend of his who had a largely unexamined motive to bring down the U.S. economy. He and his followers served as representation of the al-Qaeda terrorists. The friend was portrayed as a religious hypocrite who heartlessly had women detonate suicide bombs. One distressed suicide bomber was coolly told, ""You will meet your husband in heaven.""

If you ignore the biases, the movie is still mediocre. The focus revolved around the soon-to-be-father soldier significantly more than any other soldier, so it is evident early on he is going to die tragically. The acting quality fluctuated, but the most pitiful performance was between two of the soldiers discussing what trinkets they always bring with them when fighting. The actors acted tough at all times, so their attempt at a heartwarming moment remained an attempt. It is difficult to feel sorry for the stoic character because he doesn't seem human.",1340150400,34,1946,5.545454545454546

4732833,5,B005LAIGYQ,"Act of Valor is a great military/action movie.  It's the closest look at the Seals you'll get on the big screen and it manages to deliver a detailed look at the guys who do what they do and ask for no recognition in return.  Some reviewers have complained about the fictional storyline, but it is basically a composite story of actual missions that the Seals have undertaken.  I have no problem with that - the story is still coherent, gripping, and very much within the realm of reality.  It's certainly more realistic than ""Navy Seals"" or ""The Expendables"" or many other Hollywood action offerings.

The bluray has some bonus features that detail why the guys who made the movie made the decision to use real Seals instead of actors.  Their point is that the movie would have suffered it's authenticity and edge if actors portrayed the Seals.  The Seals that are in the movie are amazing guys - smart, extremely well trained, and in excellent physical condition.  After watching the opening action mission in this movie, you'll see why these guys did what no actor could have done.  Couple their performance with the fact that they were in a live fire environment and it's doubly amazing.  Is some of the dialogue a little stuff?  It can be in the movie's two or three slow scenes, but I wouldn't rate the acting any worse than a lot of the action fare that's out today. I feel that what little is lost in the ""acting"" is easily regained as soon as the Seals go do what they do (which is the majority of the movie).

I read about the quality of the Bluray transfer before I bought this and was expecting a few minor issues, but they largely turned out to be nothing.  There is a night scene where some camera vibration is noticeable, but other than that, it is a great looking Bluray.  The sound is absolutely excellent, one of the best mixes I've heard.  There are a decent number of extras including a few short deleted scenes, background on the filming and the live fire environment, music video etc.  The best extra however, are the interviews the the Seals that they used in the movie.  It's interesting to hear about why they do what they do and why the chose to be in the movie (all said no at first.)

Unfortunately I think there are some reviews that are overly critical because this movie portrays the military in a positive light.  That's too bad, because it is an excellent action film and the real life situations (instead of CGI everything) take this movie to a level that a lot of action films can't reach.",1340064000,,2523,4.5176211453744495

Basically a psyched out Jihad has reaquainted himself with an old childhood friend who is now a smuggler and they both plot to carry out a terrorist attack on the US and it's up to the Seal's job to do what they gotta do to stop them. The camera angles switching from First person to third person were done great. Reminded me of playing Call of Duty when it went to 1st person POV. The cinematics were great, excellent action scenes.

Many of the stars of the movie were active SEALS who portrayed the combat Navy Seals in the movie. The movie is based on real life scenarios but they are formed into a fictional story line. The action and suspense is outstanding and you understand what these soldiers endure in the face of the enemy every day.

The SEAL team was so close knit that they knew what the other was going to do before they did it. They based their philosophy on a quote from Tecumseh, ""While a single twig will break, a bundle of twigs are strong."" They were totally focused on the mission and protecting the members of their team.

This is a story about the real world and it is graphic in nature. There are some very bloody scenes and some torture done by terrorist. These scenes will get to you so just be prepared. The movie is about drug smugglers using their money to finance terrorism, particularly against America.

Since the film uses real Navy Seals as the actors the acting is OK but realistic. It is more real to life scenarios when compared to the highly polished Hollywood portrayals of soldiers. You should see this film to understand how these brave men defend our nation from those who would do us harm. The professional movie reviewers gave this movie a 25% good rating while the audiences gave it 78%. I gave it 5 stars for the storyline and for the heroes who acted in the movie and for those who died in combat.

Critics gave Act of Valor a tough time pointing to ""a clichd script, stilted acting, and a jingoistic attitude."" However 80% of viewers said they ""liked it"" on Rotten Tomatoes. I agree with the non-reviewers.
Act of Valor is a great film, that not only tells a solid story but let's us see how Navy Seals actually carry out a mission.
The realism comes from the producers, Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh, spending so much time working closely with the SEALs on a documentary. They respected the SEALs and the United States Navy respected the filmmakers. So a pact was made and Act of Valor became the first film to use actual Navy SEALs as the cast.
Members of Bandito Platoon, SEAL Team Seven are at home with their families at the beach. They know their time is limited. Their commander reminds them to get all personal matters out of their minds, and that if he needs to he will meet with their spouse or any family member who they are having a problem. He tells them their minds need to be clear with only the mission at the forefront.
Their mission is to extract Morales (Roselyn Sanchz), a CIA'operative, whose partner has been killed and she captured, tortured and most likely, unable to move on her own.
The seven man team moved into the jungle after making a successful HALO jump. They decide to enter the compound ahead of time, because they can hear screams coming from Morales. Two provide cover as five do a search by search room-clearing textbook style. Despite their professionalism the mission goes array.

4732973,5,B005LAIGYQ,"I am from a military family and I love this movie. I love the fact that Real Navy Seals were in this movie and showed this country how great our Armed Forces are.  I was moved to tears. Great action! A different movie,  Not the B.S. that is  in Hollywood now about zombies and vampires. This is what our trained soldiers really do for our country. God bless them!",1339545600,2,363,4.231884057971015
4732974,5,B005LAIGYQ,"I remember when the film first came out in theaters, and I was a bit skeptical of how effective this movie was going to be. Our Navy unit had a few SEALs around and they were not talking about it much. As it turns out, it is because almost no one even knew about the movie! Seems like it was an indy-sleeper with very little marketing. After the opening weekend, everyone on base was talking about it!

First, the movie presents real people doing their real jobs. Nothing ruins a movie for me than watching some pretty-boy actor, shooting his M4 from the hip and 'capping' bad-guys at 200m. No thanks. I'll take real people any day!

OK, so here are the negatives:
1)The acting is a trifle 'stiff'. It does remind you that these guys are sailors first and actors second. I am fine with that, but you notice it from time to time. That being said, the only time it is 'stiff' is in the scenes that are non-job related. When the action goes on screen, the flow is very natural. I wish they would have put in some real military banter. Listening to these guys in real life cutting each other up is hilarious! They should have let the SEALs improv some lines here and there!

2)There are some holes in the plot,especially if you are expecting a ""Tom Clancy"" experience.

Outside of that, the movie rocks!.

 But, you have to first appreciate what you are watching. You are seeing a modestly exaggerated expose' of the SEALs capabilities. (as compared to the silly-stupid hollywood exaggerations....yes, I mean you, charlie sheen in the 1980's SEAL movie!) Most of what they are doing in Act of Valor is a glimpse into this Spec-war world.
The movie is unique in feel and style, and worth a view, even if you are not a military buff. My wife was engrossed in this movie despite the fact that she doesn't ""get"" why we watch all this military ""stuff"".
The action is fast and hard. Even the sentimental parts are well done in the context of the movie.

I also should mention that this movie is the only pro-military movie out there right now. It means a lot to the military community to be seen as good-guys doing a hard job. Whenever Matt Damon comes out with another of his movies where he preaches (and distorts) about the military, he is not looking for sailors and soldiers to watch it.
Now, how about Act of Valor 2???",1339545600,4,2315,4.445754716981132

What a responsibility we have to not let their memory down by failing to fulfill our duties as citizens of the country so many made the ultimate sacrifice to protect and defend.

Let each of us stand up and be counted as we are able in the defense of this country and in support of the principles for which it stands and for which so many have died.

4733070,5,B005LAIGYQ,"We watch movies based on the way they make us feel.  We are seeking some kind of feeling when we put it in the disc player.  Sometimes we know what to expect and we take a gamble- that is a part of the fun even if the movie is disappointing.  Professional Movie Critics often don't get this.  An action or war movie is just an action or war movie.  I go in with that minimal expectation and I am never disappointed.  Movie directors, producers  and ""professional movie critics"" dismiss most of the movies normal people living in the other 99 percent of the world enjoy.  This is the beauty of the online, normal John Doe Review living outside the Hollywood elitist scene in the 99 percent real world.

Having said this, I was expecting an excellent movie because the trailers alone had already set my normal action war movie expectation. I was ready to feel good about this one.  The movie went beyond my expectations and blew me away.  Now, I am not your normal war/military movie buff.  I own a collection, thanks mostly to Amazon, of some 50 to 60 war movies- one for every week of the year and every war America has fought.  I am so intense on historical accuracy that I insist on switching back and forth through my D-day viewing cycle from Band of Brothers&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Band-of-Brothers-Blu-ray/dp/B00129H7VS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Band of Brothers [Blu-ray</a>] to Saving Private Ryan&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saving-Private-Ryan-Sapphire-Series-Blu-ray/dp/B003LL3N1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saving Private Ryan (Sapphire Series)  [Blu-ray</a>] playing and pausing both on two separate DVD players.

I remember these guys even if the world forgets.

So, it is fair to say I have seen my share of war movies and in particular American soldier tribute movies.  These are movies that the real 99 percent actually love.  The true 1 percent in America are the Hollywood elites, Government ruling and Union classes.  Wallstreet actually represents most of the 99 percent's retirement portfolios.  This is extremely relevant to this review based on the simple fact that in my search for the top 50 best soldier sacrifice tribute pieces the vast majority of war movies in general are America hating garbage.  Most put out by the 1 percent Hollywood elite Marxist leaning producers, writers and directors show our troops in the greatest negative light possible: unintelligent, limited vocabulary morons who kill and rape for the fun of it.  While that may be true for a handful, those of us in the real 99 percent world with family members and loved ones in harms way pay tribute to the real American soldier.  Even the out of touch elitist's freedom to be so idiotically wrong and twisted about life in general is protected by these great warriors.

The very best of America's men and women are accurately portrayed in this movie Act of Valor and it is the exact opposite of the tripe usually produced by Hollywood.  They have spouses and families they nurture.  They take lives to protect lives in America and around the world.  We see their goodness and the evil of the terrorists in stark realistic contrast.  We see their professionalism and superb physical and mental training outwitting and punishing evil.  They are a warrior class living among us willing to give their lives for their fellow Seals and us at a moments notice without flinching or blinking.  These are rare and wonderful traits and even more rare is the opportunity for us to finally see it in action.  Along with their many portrayed virtues, we see modesty.  They do not talk, they just head down range and do their job.  We can see why they might be a little offended (just a little) when a 1 percent representing political leader possessing no understanding of this Seal Creed actually has the unmitigated gall to take full credit for their actions.  This movie really helps us relate to that perspective.

I am a business man working for a regional financial instituition helping small businesses survive every single day in this economy.  I have seen my own share of economic casualties.  This movie is life changing.  I get up everyday and sometimes have to will myself to work in the midst of the economic devastation.  The US military inspires me to do my part.  If they can give their very lives to keep us free from fear and death, I can at the very least do what I do best and help keep the engines of our free economy moving.  In this very small way I try to honor their sacrifice.  Definitely one of the most inspiring and realistic movies of the year for the true American 99 percent.",1339459200,3,5085,5.141291108404385

4733166,5,B005LAIGYQ,"I'm a fan of books, movies and documentaries about Naval Special Warfare and am a former member of an Army National Guard Long Range Surveillance Unit (LRSU).

""Act of Valor"" nails the genre of inspirational films about the current U.S. military's special operations role in the Global War on Terror. In the same way that Ray Kellogg's ""The Green Berets"" presented a patriotic view of U.S. Army Special Operations in the Vietnam conflict, ""Act of Valor"" depicts Naval Special Warfare in the Global War on Terror. One significant change is the movie making is much better in ""Valor"" since the craft has advanced so much.

The depictions of Naval Special Warfare capabilities are as accurate as they come in the public media, with thrilling take-downs at sea using Mark V Special Operations Craft and what may be the first good look in popular media at the previously classified Advanced SEAL Delivery System (ASDS) miniature submarine. You also get a look at the often unrecognized Special Warfare Combatant Craft Crewman (SWCC) operations in their riverine boats. Because of the involvment of the U.S. Navy in the production of the film and the use of Naval Special Warfare personnel in the cast the look and feel are real and authentic. Much of this is because of the role of SEAL Captain Duncan Smith, a long time public affairs asset to Naval Special Warfare.

The storyline tracks similarly to the recent Tom Clancy novel ""Against All Enemies"". This is no coincidence since Clancy's name appears in the credits for ""Act of Valor"" as an advisor to the film.

For a young audience considering a role in the armed forces and especially Special Operations this is an inspirational resource. It is a genuine flag-waver and performs perfectly in that role.

As a film there are a few things about the visual mise en scene or style of filming that are interesting and unique. The gaming/simulation visual influence on ""Valor"" is apparent from camera angles that put the viewer behind the weapon of a SEAL operator in the same way games like ""Call of Duty"" do in game play. This would be an easy technique to over use, but the production/direction cast of ""Valor"" makes smart use of the tool to create suspense and perspective without seeming too ""gamy"" or contrived. Camera work with complex aerial, marine and land based scenes range from excellent to good with a lot of the former. There are only a few scenes in the movie that lack sophistication and there are more with jaw-dropping authenticity.

In any film depiction of the military intended as a tribute and inspiration the perspective of the movie is unabashedly glorious. It speaks of devotion, honor and sacrifice- as well it should- and it does so very well. This film isn't about balance, it's one perspective and presents that perspective of the Global War on Terror brilliantly. For a little literary balance on the tedium of any military experience you can enjoy a survey of the many great titles about Naval Special Operations in the Global War on Terror such as Marcus Luttrell's newest title ""Service"".

If you want a thrilling, action packed, well written and filmed accounting of Naval Special Warfare operational capabilities in the Global War on Terror be sure to include ""Act of Valor"" in your survey. It earns a five star rating with fast paced action, good story line and strong filmmaking using many current techniques in the craft. It is also one of a growing number of fitting film tributes to the many women and men who have sacrificed so much in the difficult task of defending liberty of all free people around the world.",1339372800,,3600,4.834415584415584

Most of the time we never hear about what they do - and they like it that way, because it means their missions were successful. I am so thankful for them and for all they do.

Sadly, today's entertainment industry is obsessed with anti-American movies.

I watched it 3 times in the first 2 days of owning it.  When filming the movie, the Seal Team obviously had access to their own real equipment.

It was also almost like watching an episode of GI Joe with the nice little lesson message at the end. And giving how America these days is becoming dangerously close to a Christian religious totalitarian theocracy, I think the movie and the message at the end of the movie (in the poem) is something everyone should really pay attention to.

I give it a 5/5 because it is such a good movie. Got to be honest, was not expecting to cry at the end but it was heartbreaking to see that a father will never get to know his son.. or that his son will never get to see his father.

4733337,5,B005LAIGYQ,This is the first movie that I've written a review on.  I could not pass up the opportunity of letting others know how good Act of Valor is.  This was a fabulous story of sacrifice packed with action and great cinematography.  I'm definitely going to add this to my video library.,1339200000,,280,4.450980392156863
4733338,4,B005LAIGYQ,"I was hesitant to rent this one.  I didn't go to see it in the movie theater due to the advertising -- it seemed a little gimmicky to create a movie with 'real navy seals'.  When those types of gimmicks are used, the movie is usually bad.  As it turns out, the movie was quite entertaining and definitely worth renting.

I've had a lifelong interest in the military and special ops, in particular.  I served as an infantry soldier during peace time (between the two Iraq wars) and have read a countless number of real life accounts of SEALs, Delta, Green Berets, Rangers, etc.  I don't generally like movies that are overly rah-rah patriotic and unrealistic (i.e. the good guys never die and manage to kill hundreds of bad guys) -- they just make me feel uncomfortable, like I'm watching propaganda.  I did NOT get that feeling with this movie.  While it is made completely from a pro-US perspective, the movie moves fast and doesn't dwell on politics or attempt to convert you to a specific way of thinking.  It's  unrealistic in parts but it doesn't go so far overboard where you feel like your intelligence has been insulted -- as long as you are comfortable with the concept that special operators are constantly practicing their trade and are always working on new and better ways of doing things, therefore, they are really good at what they do.

I was also concerned about the acting.  When a movie doesn't use professional actors, the lines are delivered poorly and the conversations appear contrived.  While non of the actors in this movie are going to win Hollywood awards for their performance, the movie didn't require professional actors.  It really relies on the action sequences, which are constant.  The dialogue is just there for some basic support and understanding.  The funny thing is, these men were able to deliver the 'military' conversations much more realistically than any actor could.  It was obvious that the master chief delivered a few of his lines many times in the past.  90% of the movie is mission related conversations and action.  Thus, the remaining 10% which focused on personal stories or interactions, was unimportant to my enjoyment of the movie.  To be fair, that 10% wasn't good -- there was an attempt to add to the storyline with the personal stories of a couple of the operators and it just didn't come off well.  I would have preferred that they simply referenced some of the items and didn't attempt to 'enhance' or 'personalize' the movie with that portion of the story.  I get the message but sometimes you can deliver a stronger message with less detail.  Attempting to portray a personal story without a professional actor would be like sending Robert Deniro into downtown Fallujah to shoot bad guys -- not gonna' work.

Bottom line.  I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed watching this one.  It's definitely worth a few bucks and a couple hours of your time.",1339200000,2,2912,4.774

And I have to say the acting was really distracting. If this were a reenactment I'd let it pass, but this is supposed to be a movie where the actors make you believe they are who they are playing (ironic here, since they really ARE who they are playing!).
The story was a little weak and predictable. I thought about Hot Shots as the characters were introduced. Oh, here's the guy with the baby on the way: he's a gonner! Here's the really bad guy: bet he dies really violently! But I'll let these things pass because it all came together well.
I loved the action in this movie, the cinematography and seeing all the special ops in detail. Just wish the writers could have made me care for these REAL HEROES as much as I cared for Goose when he died in Top Gun.",1339113600,7,1031,4.26530612244898

4733433,4,B005LAIGYQ,"The move starts up with an explosive scene in Manilla (literally). Here we get a glimpse of our main protagonist. From there the movie moves to what initially seems like an unrelated series of events taking place in Costa Rica which eventually is the starting point for the whole movie.

Since this is NOT a movie review, you can read plenty of those in your local newspapers (sorry to take that line from you Joe Jackson), but what I will say is that the color and visual aspects of watching a movie really come alive on the Blu Ray. While I never saw this movie in the theater, I must say that the colors are vivid and striking on this Blu Ray rendering.

The aerial photography of the fast boats moving along the river in Costa Rica is stunning as are the aerial shots of the boats both during and after their extraction too. Shots that take place on the ocean are very breath taking too.

If you're looking for a movie with literally non-stop forward movement, this is a move for you. If you're looking for in-depth story and character development, this probably won't be the movie for you. And if you really care about how well the actors portray their parts, this won't be for you either. If, on the other hand, you really want people to portray, accurately, how a SOCOM Operator would really handle themselves, both as an individual and as a unit, this is what you have always craved and are dutifully served. Think of it as a modern version of John Wayne's classic The Green Berets.

Overall this is an enjoyable movie and will not disappoint.",1338940800,4,1551,4.48936170212766

I think most people will know before they see it if they will like it or not.  I won't spend any time on that aspect of it.  Two criticisms I don't understand though are the acting and that it is a propaganda film.

Lots of critical reviews fault the acting but I don't really understand that.  Sure some of the lines are flat compared to Brad Pitt or someone but isn't that balanced or even made better by having the real people say them?  It's like being mad that real life isn't as idealistically delivered as Hollywood lines.  Sometimes we say flat or cheesy stuff in real life.

Second the propaganda angle is also a bit off.  Its simply a film about people of high character doing cool but dangerous stuff and it gives them the credit they deserve.  Its just a pseudo documentary.  It hardly sugar coats anything, no spoilers but bad things happen to bad people and good people in the film.  Maybe a little simplistic for the critics but most people really are a lot simpler than people in ""the movies"" anyway so whats wrong with a film of well-adjusted people now and then.

Finally, there is no comparison between this and many of the completely average movies out there.  I mean it grossed about the same amount as Contraband.  Really? How is that remotely as good as this movie on any basis?",1338940800,2,1461,4.428571428571429

But just know this,if you where thinking about getting this movie,don't think no more,just get it,believe me when i say this movie is worth the $19.99 plus tax.

Around 1% of Americans are fighting for our freedom.  I am not one of them and sometimes I feel disconnected from the people who actually go out there and give me and my family the opportunity to live a life without fear.

4733502,3,B005LAIGYQ,"""Act of Valor"" is an action picture with a difference:  It features actual Navy SEALS in staged scenes of what they have been trained to do.  In the wake of the SEALS' successful assassination of Osama bin-Laden, the movie seems equally a recruiting video and a gripping drama of men under pressure who never lose their cool and always stay focused on a mission's goal.

The plot concerns a SEAL team doing its part to save the United States and its citizens from international bad guys.  It takes the team from one exploit to another, often showing in minute detail how well coordinated team members are and how it is often necessary to communicate silently when discovery could mean death.  Team members are referred to only by their first names, such as Lt. Commander Rorke and Special Warfare Operative Dave.  The rest of the cast are actors.

The villains are broadly drawn -- Mexican drug cartel members, Chechnyan crime kings, and a drug smuggler turned jihadist.  They don't quite twirl their mustaches and scowl at the camera, but directors Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh aren't exactly subtle.  They actually appear at the beginning of the film, claiming its authenticity and warning of its no-holds-barred images.  Whether to hype the picture or give it a documentary feel, their appearance seems contrived.

""Act of Valor"" has the look and feel of any number of World War II movies.  We get to know the principals as they engage in gun battles and covert missions, and they are portrayed as almost supermen in their ability to read, outthink, and outshoot their enemies.

Blu-ray extras include interviews with each of the Navy SEALS, deleted scenes, directors' commentary, and several featurettes including a making-of documentary and a look at the tactics employed by Navy SEALS.  ""Act of Valor"" is also available on DVD.",1338681600,10,1831,4.921824104234528

4733574,4,B005LAIGYQ,"Saw this in the theater (and...Blu-Ray purchased!) already knowing what to expect based on some reviews. I'm a military buff so I've got stuff to watch (the extract early in the film is ridiculous...great nod to the arm of the Seals you never hear about providing support for the main teams of operators). What you've heard is likely true:

- There are no Oscar-winning performances here.

- There's a solid sense of the simulated range of missions or sub-missions that could unfold in a real-world scenario.

- There are a lot of examples of SEAL tactics and equipment (though obviously not enough to expose TOO much).

You know who you are and if you should be watching this movie. If you're looking for something well-written and like something Tom Cruise might star in or something along the lines of Band of Brothers (beautiful mini-series by the way) or Saving Private Ryan, please don't bother getting this then coming back here and giving it a bad review. Check out the trivia on IMDB and you'll understand:

- This is as much of a recruiting tool for the Navy as America's Army (the game) was for the Army.

- The team that plays the main characters in the film were actually assigned to a special public relations unit specifically for this purpose (most Spec Ops operators would never give up their identity if they can help it).

- The producers had originally cast the movie with actual actors, the SEAL team being advisers for the film. In the end, the team members felt the actors couldn't represent them properly so they pushed to be the ones on screen.

- There are a number of scenes where live ammunition was actually used. They treated it like a (somewhat) standard military exercise.

In the end, if you're a military buff, you'll get a kick out of this film. You'll laugh at the attempts at creating some sort of actors out of the SEAL team members but the combination of the action and when the team starts to get hurt, you'll get into it soon enough. The initial extract sequence at the beginning of the film is ridiculous (good ridiculous, not bad). Everyone has a right to their opinions political or otherwise (and are free to leave the political ones out of product reviews) but you can't deny we've got a pretty damned solid military. And at the very tip of that military are the Spec Ops operators getting it done despite hardship, pain, and little to no public recognition.

4733575,5,B005LAIGYQ,"""If you're not willing to give up everything, you've already lost."" After a CIA agent is kidnapped there is only one group that can get her out. The US Navy Seals are sent in to extract her. Along the way they discover a threat to the United States and are sent to stop that as well. I will save you from my every war movie is compared to ""Saving Private Ryan"" speech again because you probably can say it yourself now. I will say that the evolution of war movies is interesting though. The 70's started with movies like ""Green Berets"" which is pretty tame and went to ""Full Metal Jacket"" which got a little more graphic. Then movies like ""Platoon"" came out which changed the way they were made, more internal struggle mixed with realistic war scenes. That was the norm until ""Saving Private Ryan"". The hand-held camera feel and the as-if-you-were-there realism really raised the bar and was continued with ""We Were Soldiers"". Since then the genre has had some hits and misses but nothing really amazing since. Then this movie comes out. Rather then a full review of this I will just say that you NEED to watch this. Words can not to this justice. The fact that real seals are used in this makes the movie that much more impressive and realistic feeling. The things that they do would be unbelievable if it wasn't what they actually do. I can go on and on about this but if you have to watch one war movie in your life then make it this one. Overall, amazing and intense. One of the best movies of the year. After watching this you will feel more pride and respect for the US military then you already had. I loved it and I highly recommend this movie. I give it an A+",1338422400,6,1668,4.366559485530547
4733576,5,B005LAIGYQ,"This movie has nothing to do with politics.  You can be on the radical left, the radical right, and anywhere in between and still ""enjoy"" what this film has to offer.  This is not about the politics of war, but the end result of our current political climate superimposed on a fictional storyline through a combat perspective.  Your personal politics are inconsequential because this is a slice of what happens when you train men to shut off their human parts and do their job, which is basically to observe/retrieve/neutralize the target of their mission.  But in a greater sense, it is about doing what is necessary no matter what you want, how you feel, etc.  I doubt that is what the film makers were going for, but by nature of the duty that SEALs and other special forces perform, that is what comes across.  Do your job, do it well, do it willingly.

If you are looking to see superb, historic acting skills on display, go watch Sir Laurence Olivier in Othello.  Do not expect Sean Penn in Sam I Am or 21 Grams.  These are Sailors and when the talking parts come, do not expect them to lay out their lines like Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess on Downton Abbey.  That is not what they do.  These are warriors and the real truth in this movie comes from their physicality, the grace in their movements that is a translation of what they do out in the field.  It is beautiful, despite the brutality.  And please, lets not get on about poor acting when there are so many absurdly high-paid, professional ""actors"" who maintain careers over the course of years (*cough*KEANU*cough*) with nothing to offer but utterly awful silver screen performances.

Anywho, the same people who think this movie is unrealistic and an exaggeration are the same people who think Black Swan was unrealistic and an exaggeration.  It's that same closed mentality that refuses to see a thing for what it is, so if your mind is narrow and limited to personal experience, then you will probably not like this movie.  You have to be open to experiencing a world that is quite unilke your own.

If you like action flicks, you will like this movie.  If you like war movies, you will LOOOOVE this movie.  I like war movies, but not glossy, trite garbage like Pearl Harbor, which was terrible.  This movie has grit and edges and beautifully shot action sequences.  So check it out, if only to see what your tax dollars look like in action.",1338163200,5,2417,4.5874125874125875
4733577,5,B005LAIGYQ,"I read a couple reviews complaining about the plot and some other things.  I'd have to disagree on all of them.  One guy said he fell asleep, which I can't fathom because the explosions and gunfire ought to keep just about anybody awake even if they're not happy with the movie itself.  It's not really a slow-developing plot the way some people have said.  I just think those people were expecting explosions everywhere and tons of gunfights when the point of the movie isn't really the fighting but the life of Navy SEALs.

As for the Chechen angle, I'm not sure why that part was chosen but I can say with confidence that the movie isn't promoting Russian propaganda.  More likely, it was one of those relatively safe things they could do.  Al-Qaeda or North Koreans would probably be more realistic (although I can't really say nobody in Chechnya would ever try to attack us, terrorism is relatively cheap and we haven't exactly helped them much), but do we really need to piss the Middle East and North Korea off more?  Muslim terrorists are already gunning for us and we can't really dismiss the possibility of having to fight North Korea.  Putting out a movie where we clean their clocks would seem kind of obnoxious regardless of how realistic it would be.  For those of you who said the Chechen angle isn't realistic, do you consider the Aliens movies, Star Wars, and all the Predator movies to be realistic?  Presumably not, but that doesn't mean they're not good (well, some of them weren't good but several of them were excellent).  Even with real SEALs, it's still a movie so not everything has to be plausible.  The main elements that were supposed to be real, the people, the mechanics, the weapons, etc. were all as real as I've ever seen in a movie.

I saw one review that said This Means War is more worthwhile and is a better movie, which is total crap.  They're both very different movies so I can't really say that This Means War is worthless.  It is, however, the same kind of Hollywood production that's been around for years.  The plot is a little different but all the core elements have been done over and over.  Act of Valor is far more appealing to me specifically because it's not the type of thing that Hollywood does.

I don't know how successful I've been at convincing anybody that Act of Valor is a good movie with the bad reviews out there.  It's important to know what you're getting though.  The description says what it's about and the intent of everybody involved going in has been discussed in public a lot.  It's the kind of movie that's meant to have realistic operations and depict what a Navy SEAL's life is like abroad and at home with their families.  If you're simply looking for action, this might not be a good choice for you.  There are several reasons that you may not like this movie, but if you're interested in the military I think you should buy Act of Valor.",1338076800,15,2914,4.5489443378119

This film needs to be in everyone's military collection.  Cool stuff..,1338076800,3,340,4.728813559322034
4733579,5,B005LAIGYQ,"I had the unique opportunity to see this film 2 years before it's commercial release due to some Navy Duty I was tending to.  Before all of the computer & TV images, digital type on the screen during scene changes, music and all the other ""Hollywood"" stuff was added.  It was basically an action-packed film about possible current-day events and incorporating some true events that real SEALs have faced.  When the movie ended, I was in awe.  I had the opportunity to meet ""Mouse"" McKoy and listen to how this story was developed and how the SEALs had direct input on the Operations & story portrayed.

Since that time, I had been looking forward to the release of this film to the big screen.  I took my family to see it and all were impressed.  I was doubly-impressed after viewing it with the added graphics & soundtrack, etc.  I was even more impressed by the audience at the end of the movie.  There was no cheering or hooting & hollering.  Instead, it was as if each one of them held a reverence for the everyday sacrifices that the SEALs and other Military men & women make for our country.

Critics are critics.  Of course they'll find something to fault with the movie, that's their job.  It doesn't surprise me that they don't like the acting... cuz these guys were the real deal.  I'll take a dozen SEALs over 1 actor ANY DAY.  C'est Livre.  This is a great movie1  20x better than the false ""Navy SEALs"" of 1990 era.  THAT was terrible acting and a crap movie.  God Bless the SEALs for being able to do what they do and their families that support and wait for them.",1338076800,9,1578,4.416666666666667

The movie is awesome with fantastic audio the first half hour is ok but after that there is solid action machine guns, mini guns, helicopters,motor boats,car chase, explosions the audio is just incredible. I recommend this bluray to anyone who prefers action with very good audio & video too.",1337817600,,442,4.906666666666666
4733664,5,B005LAIGYQ,"First this: WOW !!!  This film had us glued to the screen the entire time.  All the military action looked so real and the camera-work
was flawless.  As far as the plot is concerned you can read the other reviews since they cover that pretty well.  This film reminded me so
much of Black Hawk Down, and it was just as painful to watch those scenes where our soldiers get hit by enemy bullets, RPGs and grenades.
Some reviewers have said that some of the acting was not that great and I agree somewhat.  But I do not consider that to be a deficiency of the
film since some real Navy SEALS and not professional actors were used to provide the film an authentic look and feel of military maneuvers
and communications under very hostile conditions.  The plot of the film moves very rapidly and there is almost no irrelevant material
which should not be there.  Bullets are flying practically all the time.  Absolutely great entertainment.  On the other hand, because this film
is based on real military experiences (not necessarily the plot sequences in the film), it does serve to show us citizens the hell that our soldiers
and their families have to endure to serve their country.  I feel humbled by the real sacrifices which our men and women in uniform have to make.
This is a 5-star film and a 5-star honor to our military.  I highly recommend it.",1337731200,7,1349,4.533057851239669
4733665,5,B005LAIGYQ,"This movie was awesome. It's definitely going on my list of movies that I watch when I need inspiration.  It provides a small glimpse into the sacrifices that the men of the U.S. special ops community make for our country and for their brother operators. One of the things that sets this movie apart from others is it also provides insight to the sacrifices made not just by the men but by their families as well.  It serves as a reminder of how grateful I am for all the U.S service men and women, and especially men like the ones in this movie.

 In my opinion, this movie stands out in a world of movies filled with hollywood fiction, B.S., and movie magic. It provides more realistic action without going over the top like your average shoot em up movie. If you want typical hollywood cheesy action then go watch the charlie sheen rendition of navy seals. To me, this movie is more about the message, the inspiration, and the feeling of gratitude that you take away from it.

Many thanks for these seals, the other men of the special ops community, and all the men and women serving around the world. The next time you are thinking of how much you enjoy freedom. Thank the next soldier you see.

Sure the Philippines has it's problems with terrorists just like England, France, and the rest of the world! But that does not mean they are predominately muslim too!

Another one-star reviewer made a good point about the military cultism he saw in this film.  I imagine that reviewer, like so many people here in the U.S., doesn't have access to much independent analysis (like the radio show, 'Democracy Now!') that further confirms his point.  Most of our elite establishment media feeds the cult-like idolization of the military; but, here and there, a person can find resources that expose the military industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us about&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complex-How-the-Military-Invades-Our-Everyday-Lives-American-Empire-Project/dp/0805089195/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complex: How the Military Invades Our Everyday Lives (American Empire Project)</a>.

We desperately need to stop the Big Government and Big Business collusion that is bankrupting our country through the endless waste, fraud and abuse of Pentagon spending; and end the suffering caused by our perpetual warfare.  Our best defense, and the best way for citizens to act in a valorous way, is to seek honest critiques of war-mongering and the propaganda that makes it possible.

I gathered my emotions and away I went to the theater. I sat in excited anticipation for the movie to start despite my fear of being ""emotional"" before the movies end. The movie started a little slow and seemed to jump around a little.

 After very few minutes though, it started coming together and sucked me in like a massive vortex!!!! Some people complain about the Seals not being actors....... Had I of not known ahead of time they were not actors, I would never have guessed it. In the heat of battle, they were so realistic I was drawn into the battles with them.... you can almost feel the adrenaline!!!!

 Very action packed, moving, and exciting movie!!!! It does have some really rough language in it, intense action and of course war violence so I would not reccomend it for a young audience or some one easily offended by foul language and blood. However, if you can get past the language, this a MUST SEE move!!!!

 By the time the credit screen was up, I had to make myself breath!!!! As I left the theater my heart was pounding and I had to make myself quit breathing so hard..... I was so hyped up!!!! This is ONE AWESOME MOVIE!!! A great tribute to our Special Forces......... I think it would be good for every American to watch this movie!!!!!

4733785,5,B005LAIGYQ,"This movie does what no other movie has ever done--presented the audience with a close depiction of SEAL operational reality through the eyes and actions of real active-duty service members who serve as the main characters in the movie.

The scene in the South Pacific where SEAL Team 4 takes down Cristo's yacht is spectacular.  In addition, the dialog that immediately follows during the interrogation of Cristo by a Navy Senior Chief known as ""Otto"" is exceptionally well-done.  In some ways, this witty exchange aboard Cristo's recently-boarded yacht was one of the best in the movie.  The New York Times interviewed the actor that played ""Cristo"" in the film, Alex Veadov. The NY Times states:  For their fellow actors, there was, for instance, an immersion in a novel kind of Method acting. In one memorable scene a SEAL member known only as Senior Chief interrogates a Russian arms smuggler played by Alex Veadov.

""He had just gotten back from Afghanistan,"" Mr. Veadov said of Senior Chief. ""At first it was O.K. As it progressed a little, and he starts throwing things around, it kind of became a little tense.

""When he started speaking Croatian, though, it became freaky. I don't speak Croatian, but he must have looked me up on the Internet. I had done a play with a Croatian company. So he did research on me as an actor. And I was little bit intimidated. After all, this is what this guy does for a living.""

Aviation tech is exceptional in the movie.  The surveillance of an airstrip in Somalia was breathtaking as a Grumman HU-16 Albatross seaplane swoops in followed by an unmarked Douglas DC-3 cargo plane.  The RQ-11 Raven drone plays a prominent role during a jungle personnel recovery.

The producer reports that over 90% of the action sequences were filmed using ""live fire.""

Don't miss this movie.  It was filmed on a relatively low budget.  Directors Mike ""Mouse"" McCoy and Scott Waugh should be commended for their efforts to bring us a technically accurate peak into the Navy SEALs way of life.  Reward their effort by going to see the movie in theaters and by buying the movie on DVD or Blu-ray.  The cinematography is breathtaking and the backdrops are epic.  Mexico, Puerto Rico, Ukraine, Cambodia, and Florida.  The explosion scene set in the Philippines (filmed in Phnom Penh, Cambodia) was said to have involved 300 child extras.

4733787,5,B005LAIGYQ,"I went to see Act of Valor in the Cinema on its release, I gave it five stars for the Action scenes alone.

Using an exceptional blend of real-life people and original filmmaking; Act of Valor stars a group of active-duty Navy SEALs, which shows their true commitment to country, team and family. The film is inspired by true events and combines excellent combat sequences using the latest battlefield technology resulting in a true to life action film for the ultimate action/adventure movie fan.

The film focuses on a SEAL Team and shows the secretive world of these elite and highly trained soldiers. In a story of global anti-terrorism, Act of Valor takes audiences deep into the kidnapping and rescue of a CIA operative, which reveals the discovery of a deadly terrorist plot against the US. The SEAL team is then dispatched on a race against time manhunt, to prevent the terrorist attack.

There has been some talk about the quality of the acting, but take into account who is playing the main characters, then this is not a movie about acting, if we can believe that professional footballers and wrestlers can play soldiers then why can't we let real Navy Seals show us how its done!

One movie may carry different messages and with this movie, one message alone can bring the movie 5 star rating. The message of sacrifices.
I do not understand why some critics consider this movie a propaganda. This movie sends a message that NAVY SEALS is NOT for everyone, that if you choose this path, you may die before your child is born. A propaganda does not need real SEALS to participate in it. They don't have to shoot live rounds, to make things really authentic.

After seeing this movie, I have a stronger belief in great men do exist, in courage, in patriotism and in tradition. I feel an emotion so strong, a value gained so great that is hard to find in most of the so called ""well acted"" Hollywood movies.

4733885,4,B005LAIGYQ,"An elite SEAL team is tasked with recovering a captured CIA agent. They stumble across intelligence which leads them on an international man-hunt for a terrorist who is plotting strikes within the US.

The movie overall has a tough job of walking the line between being action-packed and realistic. The film uses active/real Navy SEALs, which causes a small hit in the acting department. Lines are delivered like real human beings having a conversation and not with over the top drama like most war movies- even in combat they get on with soldiering and never have that hysterical ""Oh no, what do we do now?!"" moment. It's like we are an invited guest overhearing the military briefings and are eavesdropping in on intimate conversations with the team members. This works out well as it builds a sense of intimacy between us; the viewing audience, and the SEALs.

Act of Valor follows many real military protocols and it was nice to hear the proper and more correct use of the phrase `Frag-Out' as opposed to ""Fire in the Hole"", which is used in most movies. They took a few liberties by showing the SEALs acting without air support for several of their missions and having this single unit deployed for the entire movie -on missions spanning the globe. I guess we don't have that many SEALs after all- maybe fitting since they do say ""Damn Few"". To explain the limited use of Air Calvary, one officer explained that they did not want another ""Blackhawk Down"" and so it was boots on the ground for the entire mission. Nice reference.

 The Video Game Connection

Many other reviews are calling this movie an Army Recruitment commercial. I didn't see that at all. I felt a sense of pride for our armed forces and took a second look at the kinds of sacrifices our men and women are asked to make as part of their service. Top Gun was the kind of movie that made you want to fly a jet by the end. Hell, they started putting recruitment booths outside the theaters when that movie hit full momentum. Act of Valor made me want to play a game like Call of Duty or anything where I get to rush buildings and shoot terrorists. They even placed the camera at the top of the barrel like a first-person shooter in many of the action sequences. So I'm already saying I'm surprised this movie doesn't tie in to a video game. Seems like an obvious opportunity.

 Extra Points Awarded for avoiding these clichs ...

1) One dimensional Characters. Each member of the Seal team was somewhat similar to each other and were all normal men. This eliminates broad character extremes like `The Angry/Gung-ho Soldier', `The Jokester', and `The Coward'. The Stern/Stoic Captain, `The Sensitive Journal Keeper', `The A-hole (who always lives), The Goodie (who dies) and `The Psycho'.

2) The leader or captain who cares more about the men than the mission. *Probably not the guy you'd put in charge of a mission where saving his soldiers would mean the death of many more, usually including his men eventually.

3) The General or commander who cares more about the mission than the soldiers, even when his disregard for their lives actually jeopardizes the mission.

4) One super soldier killing an incredible amount of enemies- especially if he's about to die and also Act of Valor avoided weapons with unlimited ammo.

5) Jar-head soldiers who only care about killing and getting laid. For once, it's not the girl back home; it's the wife and children back home. That adds a whole new dimension to what's being sacrificed by simply being active- way beyond just living and dying on a mission.

6) Cursing to be `realistic'. There are professionals who have respect and a high regard for all the other branches so there was no slight to the other branches and the language was relatively clean.

 The Atmosphere

The soundtrack and sound effects are a highlight in this movie. I saw Drive by Nicolas Winding Refn starring Ryan Gosling and felt like the movie grabbed my stomach and wouldn't let it go until the end. I had a similar feeling with Act of Valor due to its near-perfect pacing and tense and suspenseful atmosphere. Side note: That great rap song used in the trailer does not appear in the movie (unless it's tacked on at the end of the credits) nor does it seem to be on the soundtrack. And from what I understand the soundtrack is comprised of country music. Surprising- since the instrumental music and incidental tones in the movie were epic and orchestral in nature.

Politics is a small issue in Act of Valor. The burden of the bad guy falls on two characters. A smuggler names Christo and the old-school Jihad terrorist, Abu Shabal. The Russian Christo is given a bit of humanity by showing that he has some sensibility and sensitivity. The main terrorist Shabal is pretty much an animal for all intents and purposes and we never find out why or how he got to be that way (do you really care? Didn't think so). If you have strong feelings either way about US overseas policy, you know whether or not you should be seeing this film. Aside from that, it's not the job of any SEAL to figure out just how evil or justified the bad guy is. For most movies, you can put a names and faces on the enemy soldiers to let us know that war is bad and there are real people on the other end of those guns. Terrorists will not get any such treatment so do not include that as poor character development as a criticism of Act of Valor.

Overall, I enjoyed Act of valor and would recommend it to anyone who wants to a solid action movie that's heavy on the realism. If you want to see a more dramatic focus on the individual then I recommend The Hurt Locker. If you want to see more of a documentary, I suggest Restrepo.",1334188800,2,5698,4.575073601570167
4733886,5,B005LAIGYQ,"I saw this with my father while it was in theaters and I knew exactly what I was going there to see: Real active-navy seals showing us what they really do and how they are willing to sacrifice their lives at any moment to keep me and you safe at home. The acting was very good I thought. I don't know why I've heard so many people saying the acting was poor. These real navy seals in my opinion did a better job acting than many ""trained"" real actors do. I thought they seemed genuine, sincere and confident. All things that make an actor a ""good"" actor.

I already had a reverence for those in military service for our country before seeing this film, but after, I have an much ""deeper"" respect for them. I left the theater with a strong sense of pride in my country. A feeling of loyalty and obligation to not just the land we live on and protect but for the ""principles"" those navy seals fought for. Principles like: truth, honor, justice, freedom, and mercy. I wish more movies where like Act of Valor. Without all the hollywood garbage stuffed in. Genuine acting. Genuine story-telling. This movie may have not garnered the box office attention or profit that a big budget hollywood action war movie would, but it gave us a strong taste of the goodness and values that are missing from our Entertainment today. I understand this. But I am just one person. If more people understand this then we will see more movies like Act of Valor. Movies that portray the good that all of us as human being are capable of.

Should be recommended to be watched in every high school to show what these brave and courageous men and woman for Americas safety and freedom. They do not bat an eye to make the ultimate sacriface for this nation or each other.

The fact that the producers used REAL Navy Seals was just the best thing that could've been done for a war movie. Not to mention, real bullets were used in the gunfight scenes in the film. This just adds to the authenticity of the movie. No stuntmen, here. Of course, Navy Seals actually use real bullets during training, which can be very dangerous. However, these are Seals we are talking about. They know what they are doing. To listen to the weapons being fired during gunfights were just INTENSE, especially when shown in first person. The movie gives the watcher a good idea of what the Navy Seals are like. You can see why the Seals train how they train because of the tactics and preciseness of their shots. Overall, the story is very good. The producers created a fictional story based and inserted REAL ''Acts of Valor"" that the SEALS did. In other words, every thing that happen to a SEAL in the movie, actually happened to a SEAL in real life, but in a different scenario. Don't expect great acting! Of course, you shouldn't because the Seals are NOT actors!!!! All I can say is this movie is worth owing, especially for those, who haven't seen it.",1333756800,6,1291,4.497872340425532
4733890,5,B005LAIGYQ,"The Editorial Review that Amazon chose to post with this item should be totally ignored.

Yes, I am sure that Act of Valor does not meet the standards set by whatever college film class Fetzer attended.  However, if you want to watch a movie that shows a fantastic example of the code that American warriors live by, then Act of Valor is a must see.  Fetzer is correct on one point; the film does set up a dynamic of absolute moral clarity:  Evil terrorists and drug dealers versus heroic members of the US military - just like in real life.  I am sure many can understand how that accurate a portrayal makes Hollywood and their followers very nervous.

If you want a taste of what the US military does to keep this country safe then this is the movie for you.

My complaint is the idea or premise that Chechens would attack the U.S. Since the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, Chechnya, a tiny state, has been fighting to get its independence from Russia. Putin has painted Chechens as international terrorists solely so he could brutally smash them without Free World interference. For an example, google 'Grozny' and see how Putin's air force and artillery have obliterated Chechnya's once-cosmopolitan capital city. Putin has terrorized the entire Chechen nation and had assasssinated any human rights activists who tried to expose him, e.g. google Anna Politovskaya, et al. The biggest problem with this film is pulp Hollywood writers/producers who don't do  their terrorist homework and spread Putin's propaganda.",1332633600,48,887,5.522058823529412
4734011,2,B005LAIGYQ,"In 2007, around the time that Act of Valor was first being kicked around by the Navy, the military was experiencing the lowest recruitment levels in their history. It was so bad, that within a few months they would be lowering the entrance standards to historic levels. Something had to be done, and since they already had directors Scott Waugh and Mike ""Mouse"" McCoy on the payroll shooting recruitment vids, it made sense to use their talents in what would essentially be a feature length commercial that would feature real military grade equipment and active duty Navy Seals.

It's not the worst idea in the world. John Ford made propaganda movies for the military during WWII. Although Act of Valor probably would have disappeared into the dustbin of movie history if not for the arrival of Seal Team 6 into the national consciousness. Their high profile capture and disposal of Osama Bin Laden had every studio clamoring for a movie on the prized military unit, and in June of 2011 Relativity bought the rights to Act of Valor for a whopping sum, especially when you figure there isn't a single big name star attached.

With all that build up, Act of Valor digs itself into a pretty deep hole right off the bat, with the directors explaining to us in detail just how authentic their movie is compared to others. To their mind, and that of the Navy apparently, no actor can adequately carry out the physical and emotion tolls. Their movie is different than everybody else's. A perfectly fine position to take if actors were being asked to actually go to war. But as it turns out, soldiers can't carry the emotional and physical tolls of...well, acting. Even worse, McCoy and Waugh prove themselves to be exactly what they claim not to be in the beginning, which is just another pair of Hollywood directors pulling the exact same stunts. What's the difference between these two and the Crank duo of Neveldine/Taylor? Oh, Neveldine/Taylor have a signature style, that's what. McCoy and Waugh look like they studied at the Peter Berg School for Michael Bay Imitators.

The story actually kicks off with an unsettling bang, with a suicide bomber in Jakarta using an ice cream truck to lure dozens of children into the blast radius. Confidence that we may be privy to a more realistic, less glamorized approach is bolstered by the matter-of-fact nature of this disturbing scene. The incident is the tip of the iceberg, of course, with a deep cover agent(Roselyn Sanchez) investigating the terrorists beaten and taken hostage, forcing the United States to call in the heavy hitting Navy Seals for a snatch 'n grab operation that soon explodes into a full on war against terror.

It's at this point we're introduced to the brave men(no skirts on this squad!) we'll be following for the course of the film, mostly through some terribly dry and plodding narration giving us the most basic introduction to the team as possible. Part of the reason could be to emphasize the unit rather than the individual, which is understandable, but that idea is nixed with the stilted attempt to show a close-knit and deeply personal bond between Dave and Lieutenant Rorke. We see the entire unit and their families hanging out on the beach, the men saying tearful good byes to their families before deployment on this dangerous mission. Using the soldiers and their real life families proves to be a major mistake for a number of reasons, but the most significant is that it's hard even for the most well trained actor to play themselves. In an instance like this, what we get are soldiers and their wives acting out how they wish to be portrayed, rather than just being natural. It comes off as stiff and resoundingly inauthentic.

All the while this is being backed by the narrator, making vague allusions to bravery, honor, and courage. Great ideals to uphold, certainly, but the guy reading it sounds like somebody forgot to remove the bolts from his head. It's just macho talk with little substance behind it, a warrior code that you might find draped on the tunnel leading onto a football field, or screamed into a boxer's face between rounds. It sounds good, and hits all the patriotic buttons, but not much else. Frankly, it sounds like something out of Zack Snyder's 300, so it shouldn't be a surprise to know the script comes from that Spartan flick's writer, Kurt Johnstad. Nuance and subtlety haven't entered into his playbook over the last five years, apparently.

Succeeding in it's primary objective most completely during the film's biggest action set piece, where the actual live fire from the military grade armaments is put to jaw dropping use as the team mounts a watery rescue mission. Waugh and McCoy set the action up beautifully, revelling in the thousands of spent bullet shells booming from the hydrofoil's cannon. This leads to a crazy, high speed chase that shows the directors will make some great action movies in the future. Great Hollywood style action movies. The rest of the film spits in the face of their supposed realism yet again, as splattery head shots are all too frequent, seen in a video game style first-person shooter perspective that we've seen numerous times before. There's nothing new here, and while that isn't necessarily a bad thing, when you make the claim that we're about to experience something totally outside the realm of Hollywood filmmaking, you ought to back that up. Right?

Act of Valor is going to be a polarizing film, though, as some will bend themselves into a pretzel to defend it and it's heroic stars. On the way out of the attended screening, a colleague in the same breath categorized the film as being the most realistic military move he had ever seen and it was totally like Call of Duty.  What?  The truth lies somewhere in between. The genuine hardware does add a little something extra, but the bad acting, generic direction, and the filmmaker's outright arrogance does the movie no favors. Waugh and McCoy can pump their chests all they like over using real soldiers to re-enact what soldiers do, but who cares if they fail miserably at presenting a cohesive story? This is a movie, after all, right? Best leave it to the professionals.",1332288000,28,6195,4.81484962406015
4734012,3,B005LAIGYQ,"This review is not a review of a Blu Ray or DVD but on the content of the movie.  I went to see Act of Valor in the theater I felt let down a little bit because it did not shed light on what families of military personnel had to go through to make any war possible.  While I applaud the heroic effort of the men and women protecting our countries from extremists, the film ignores the family members who have been equally burden by the absence of their significant others.  It seems that family members have no voice and no role in the conflict.  In addition, the actors portraying these heroes are too devoid of emotions.  As I watched the movie I didn't feel anything other than being thankful of their service to their nation.  Act of Valor should have made me feel rather than being informed, too bad.

With regard to detail, the movie begins with a scene that was suppose to be in the Philippine but was shot in Cambodia.  As I watched the movie I saw buildings and famous landmark in Phnom Penh Cambodia and I did a quick fact check in my head and I didn't remember any recent news about bomb blast in Phnom Penh.  I was confused for about 45 seconds into the movie until I realize it was just a movie location.  In the age of internet and google search if the story is in the Philippine they should have just went to the Philippine to shoot it there.  Don't assume the viewers are ignorant about locations of the world.",1332115200,4,1426,4.2835820895522385
4734083,5,B005LAIGYQ,"Saw it in a theater, and had heard all the news stories about bad line delivery and bad acting, and on and on.

Having worked with professional men like this in the past, from various branches, all I saw was real men talking like men talk.  I didn't see stuttering or off character delivery of lines, etc.  So, I have no idea what bet wetters were so concerned about the dialogue. I think some people in Hollywood, or somewhere, must have been concerned about the idea that actors weren't necessary, and in fact, would have made it not so great a picture. (IMHO) It was good to see the real deal, and see them get some credit for what they do, while we sleep peacefully in our beds at night.

As for other critics who said it was a video game, well, you just have no clue.  Where do you think FPS video games get their ideas from, watching reruns of Gilligan's Island?  They get it from someone, somewhere who had it going on.  So, pardon me if it looked like a video game to you, but it looked like what SEALs do, and in some cases, what other elite forces do. If its a video game to you, so be it.

I was proud to see the real men doing the job, even though the plot was fictional, it was cool to know these men really do stuff like this, so it was a good movie all around.  I'd like to see more like this!

The ending, I thought the transition from the end into the credits was a good move back to reality, painful, but good.

4734084,4,B005LAIGYQ,"One thing is for sure if you venture to see ""Act of Valor""; you will be seeing something you've never seen before. It is almost like a documentary, but it isn't, but it's entirely realistic. The actors in the fictional movie, based on actual Navy Seals operations, are real life seals and because of that, some of the acting is a little stiff, but on the other hand, because of that, the Seals operations depicted are jaw-dropping realistic.

On February 7th, retired Lt. Gen James Vaught confronted Special Ops Commander Adm. Bill McRaven about the recent openness of the Seals tactics following the killing of Bin Laden and in the forefront of the release of this movie. The seals rely on secrecy to prevail. They require anonymity to be who they are. So, does ""Act of Valor"" reveal too much about the tactics of Navy Seals? I would be nave to have an opinion either way, but I do anyway. Navy Seals require all elements of a team working together. One comment in the movie was this, ""One stick can easily be broken, but in a bundle, that stick is strong.""  Seals are the best of the best. If our enemies learn anything from this film, it is that if the Seals are onto you, you better have been trained well.

""Act of Valor"" as said to me by a veteran of Vietnam who was sitting nearby in the movie theatre, ""should be required viewing in high schools and college.""  It is plain and simple an inside look of the sacrifice that these elite men do to keep the world safe. There is evil in the world and as much as many try to deny it, it is true and these Navy Seals silently, secretly and without praise, defend us on a regular basis so that we can sleep at night and get up and watch the news and have opinions about what is going on in the world.

The bird's eye view inside the Navy Seals is one of a kind and not to be missed. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the film. I felt the intensity of the operations first hand, understanding what was at stake and knowing that these men, although it was just a movie, are patriots and comrades to the 9th degree.

The narrator who is also the Chief, or leader of the Seals has a very strong and low voice which made me want to listen and kept me interested.

This movie is most impressive because of its realistic action.  Secondly, it is impressive because it is a non-typical Hollywood product, i.e. not inherently anti-American or politically correct in storyline or undertones.  Although some may remark that the acting is weak, in actuality the fact that the cast members are not professional actors makes it more real even if it is not as polished.  The plot is fine although somewhat formulaic.  The bottom line is that this movie is special because it is about as real as it gets.

We absolutely need more movies LIKE this and we absolutely need REAL men like the real men in the movie in our lives.

The United States of America would not be a safe place period, if we did not have such brave men and woman of all military service and our local men and women fighting on our own streets.

My thoughts, prayers and gratefulness to all the men and women that serve and to their families that await for their safe return... so that my freedom will not be taken, so that I can sleep well and safe every night, so that I enjoy the smallest of things that I take for granted (such as walking out my door alive or enjoying a meal with a friend in a restaurant without being bombed).

Shame on any of us in the United States of America who does not see how great, good and necessary this movie is for Americans... to always be reminded. Great job navy men and great job director.",1330905600,32,1197,4.191304347826087
4734088,4,B005LAIGYQ,"Is there progress to be made in depicting the war on terror in film? What if you depict events in that war starring the brave individuals who are actually fighting it? Crazy, right? But crazy enough to work?

  The film opens with voice-over of a man reading the always heart-wrenching last letter. Later we're introduced to two CIA operatives deep inside an organization with ties to terrorists. Lisa Morales (played by Roselyn Sanchez) and Walter Ross (played by Nestor Serrano) are acting as aid workers in a small town in Mexico while investigating the town's benefactor, commonly referred to as Christo. Christo (played by Alex Veadov) is a smuggler with ties to a Muslim extremist by the name of Abu Shabal (played by Jason Cottle). When Morales and Ross (Sanchez and Serrano) are discovered, Ross is killed and Morales is kidnapped and held hostage so that she can be tortured for information. Once those in authority discover signs of a struggle in Morales' residence, a crew of Navy SEALs is called in to perform a rescue mission. Revealing any additional details would give away too much of the story.

  Now, having only seen the film once, character names and story arcs are kind of a blur. Also, as the names of the lead ""actors"" in this film are being withheld for security reasons, any praise or criticism of any particular cast member is pointless. Of course, these men are not actors. Then again, I've seen plenty of highly-paid actors star in films that weren't half as interesting. Every action scene was a thrill a minute and those moments in-between were a welcomed relief. I urge all of-age action fans to see this movie at their earliest possible convenience.",1330819200,7,1682,4.822916666666667
4734089,4,B005LAIGYQ,"And to think, back in the day, I thought 1990's NAVY SEALS was the authentic shizzy. NAVY SEALS doesn't hold a candle to ACT OF VALOR. Charlie Sheen would soil himself if thrown in the company of this film's tough as nails cast, a significant chunk of which is comprised of real life active duty U.S. Navy SEALs (whose names, by the way, are left off the credits). ACT OF VALOR is neither as ferociously right wing nor as jingoistic as I've been led to believe. Yes, there are moments which very well may invoke your bump of patriotism. But, mostly, it's a thrilling, well-crafted war picture. It may even recruit a whole new mess of squids.

Roselyn S&aacute;nchez is the only recognizable name here. She plays a CIA operative who is abducted while working undercover in Costa Rica. When SEAL Team 7 is deployed on an extraction mission, a terrorist plot concerning multiple attacks on U.S. soil is unearthed.

There's no doubting that this cast of Navy Seals is accomplished on many, many fronts. But, understandably, their acting skills aren't so squared away. Still, there's something inherently likable about these elite frogmen, and it's not just because these men are genuine heroes who put their lives on the line every day to protect our butts. The film focuses most on two Seals - Lt. Rorke, who is an expecting father for the first time, and his best friend, a USN Chief who also serves as the (sometimes awkward) voiceover narrator. If there's a closet actor hiding in this bunch of rookie actors, it's the guy who plays the Senior Chief. Of everyone, he flaunts the most personality. One of my favorite scenes has him conducting an interrogation onboard a smuggler's yacht. I love it that he swings down onto the yacht, removes his military gear, and reveals a suit and tie underneath. It's a nice touch.

I found it easy enough to overlook the sometimes wooden performances, found it easy to admire their earnestness. All those bonding moments early on - as the Seals and their families gather at the beach just before a black ops - may seem corny and trite, but it cements in my mind how close the team members are and just how much they depend on each other. It's particularly telling that the Chief would advise the others to make sure to straighten out their personal affairs before they all head ""downrange."" Carrying personal baggage into the field of engagement is one sure way to compromise the mission and the men.

There are no hotshots on SEAL Team 7, no cocky Charlie Sheens. What they lack in things thespian-y, they more than compensate for with the authenticity they stamp on the screen. These cats move a certain way, behave a certain way. They handle their weaponry with a familiarity born out of hard-earned experience. When the film arrives at those moments fraught with warfare, they look extremely competent and professional. The combat sequences are intense and, at times, visceral. This isn't a documentary, but it at times captures the feel of one. I'm cribbing a quote here: ""ACT OF VALOR is a field manual on current weapons and tactics, a primer on the whys of acts of terrorism, and how SEAL teams and other units are prepared to protect America and Americans from such fanaticism.""

One of my favorite poems is Rudyard Kipling's ""If."" But Shawnee Chief Tecumseh's poem - which is read outloud in the film - is equally as stirring. Both Tecumseh and Kipling have crafted codes of conduct that we all should honor and live by. But when folks choose to ignore their words, at least we've got our boys downrange covering our backs. Them damn few.

Just awesome capabilities in each man, and incredible equipment their given to carry out their missions with. My lone ""complaint"": I wish the names of SEALS scrolling in the credits was slower. Besides ""See this now"" my other admonition is ""Stand and honor them"" when you see the list.",1330819200,20,383,4.907692307692308

This movie was harder to watch the second time, but man, do I love this film.  I am a retired Chief who served on submarines.  Everything I saw that related to my career was absolutely accurate.  I imagine the rest of the film was just as credible.  I sure admire these military folks!",1330732800,178,532,6.232876712328767
