8504156,5,B006TTC4ZU,"I love Seth and his buddies in these teenage boy comedies. Not everything has to be SO serious. Not everything has to Academy Award's worthy movies. Much better then strictly Adam Sandler type movies, which a few of those are pretty great too. I can watch these three movies over and over and I do. Life, when did it get so serious? Watch a goofy movie, you will feel better",1396656000,,374,4.357142857142857
8504157,4,B006TTC4ZU,"The only reason I gave this review 4/5 stars is because I am not that big a fan of ""Knocked Up"". Otherwise, I love this movie collection! They are hilariously raunchy (so no kids, for sure) and the unrated versions included in these sets are way funnier than the versions I'd seen on TV. The shipment was quick and they arrived in perfect condition.",1348704000,2,349,4.46875
