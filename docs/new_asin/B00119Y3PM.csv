8241154,3,B00119Y3PM,"but this is not what I call a video. . . it was a slide show with narrative -- very much like viewing someone's vacation photos.  The images do not appear to be digital quality either.  There are some wonderful FREE videos on Provence and its towns and regions available for viewing through Amazon Prime that are far more visually enjoyable and informative.  As someone who has spent considerable time traveling through Provence, this was a definite let down.",1374019200,,459,4.784810126582278
8241155,1,B00119Y3PM,"Two issues with this video. I bought this video thinking I was buying a DVD I could play on my player/TV like any other DVD. For $24.95, it should, right? After getting a 'location' error across my TV screen (and a 'cannot play' error on my DVD player readout), I exchanged for a new copy, which Amazon was very happy to supply.  This DVD is advertised as being for ALL regions.  The replacement DVD does the same thing, but will play on my computer at work - for $24.95???  The previous reviewer said they played this DVD in their 'player' (not a computer). My other gripe is that this DVD covers only the western portion of Provence, and at the end says something like ""we'll talk about Cote d'Azur and other areas next time"" (not included on the disc).  There is no indication in the product description that this DVD does not cover the ENTIRE region.  On the plus side, I did enjoy what I could play on my computer - very informative.  Sadly, I am returning both copies. I was so looking forward to a good tour of ALL of lovely Provence,in the comfort of my own home [and not at my office desk]!",1269475200,,1099,4.336585365853659
8241156,4,B00119Y3PM,"This DVD deserves a review!  My fiance' and I purchased it without having read any testimonials, and we're happy to say it is a wonderful little film to whet your appetite for Provence.  We had planned a honeymoon trip there, and this DVD helped us narrow down our destination choices.  There is just so much to see and do in Provence, and this DVD does a nice job of giving you the lay of the land, so to speak. The narration is in several different languages, including English.

Perhaps the most fun part was to pop the DVD into the player again after we returned from France, and to realize just how much of the country we had seen!",1260921600,,636,4.319327731092437
