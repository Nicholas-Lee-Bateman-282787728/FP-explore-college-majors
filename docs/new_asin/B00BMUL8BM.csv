8571130,5,B00BMUL8BM,This movie is awesome. Definitely not made recently.. Though I'm not sure how to research it; I'm fairly sure the late Mathew McGrory is in the first film as a zombie. It's a good cheesy film,1465084800,,191,4.333333333333333

8571135,1,B00BMUL8BM,"This is another Redbox/ Full Moon rip off. Once again they have tricked me into renting a cool named film with a neat cover. This is in fact 3 features of edited full length films. Yes, three 90 minute films cut down to 30 minutes or so.

The three films are:

Zombie Apocalypse- This is taken from the film ""The Dead Hate the Living"" made in the year 2000.

Undead Sentence- A badly cut version of ""Prison of the Dead"" from the year 2000.

Shallow Graves- This is taken from ""Hell Asylum"" the ""new"" film in the group. It is from 2002.

Save your money.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex. No nudity.",1368489600,17,594,4.306306306306307
