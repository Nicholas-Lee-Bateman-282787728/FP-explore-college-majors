2052045,4,B00020HB14,I would say that this is a great movie from the 1980s for any senior in high school working to the last minute to get accepted into the college of their choice along with some of the pressures along the way. A very good movies that sometimes gets lost in the shuffle of other 1980s teen type movies. Give it a watch!,1141344000,3,316,4.112903225806452
2052046,4,B00020HB14,"This movie highlights so many truths of college admissions.  Personally, I think the whole college thing is crap.  And this movie made me slightly more depressed about it but also hopeful in a way, because I knew what they were saying was true.  This movie proves that you don't have to be smart or talented to succeed in school, you just have to know the right formulas.  And apparently I know all the right formulas but that hasn't gotten me any farther in life.  So the people that get horrible grades in high school and don't get into any of the ""good"" schools need not worry.  They can probably succeed in life anyway.  I really think this movie is worth viewing for any high school junior or senior who's beginning to take the college admissions game a little too seriously.  I know it helped clear my head and actually helped me decided that some of the schools with really good reputations are way too pretentious for me.",1116028800,2,929,4.520958083832335

8019439,5,B00020HB14,"In Spanish "" Desventuras de un Estudiante "". Made in 1989. A very good and funny  film of my High School years. It's in Spanish too in mono. It's not stereo but it sounds well. Subtitles in Spanish and English.",1499990400,,210,4.25
8019440,4,B00020HB14,"We ordered this movie because we are about to send our kiddo off to college and this was something we knew
would give her a very small insight into what some colleges are like and what others should be like. The idea of
going to a college that does not put all the emphasis on SAT scores and looks at the student for who they are and
what they have already accomplished. This is something that we discuss all the time with our kids and with
our kids friends. When you are getting ready to send one off to college it is pretty much all you talk about.
We have two more kiddos on the same path and when they are older we will share this movie with them too.

It is a comedy, silly and not at all a realistic situation, but it got the point across well. Sometimes through
laughter you are able to actually learn something interesting.
There is not much more I can say about this movie without giving away plot or other information that may ruin it
for you. It's good, not five stars but it is four stars good for sure.",1460937600,,1015,4.152284263959391

8019442,5,B00020HB14,"This movie was sent in the condition stated, and arrived on time. This movie is somewhat cheesy, but hilarious. Fun fact, Guy B in the word problems is Tom Kenny, who is the voice of SpongeBob SquarePants.",1434585600,,205,4.5675675675675675
8019443,4,B00020HB14,"This DVD may seem dated, but it's fun :  a combination of laugh-out-loud humor and satire with a romantic ending.  Many of the situations are real:  the pressure of the SAT, the crazy way some students think about college, the sometimes dubious help of out-for-profit SAT tutors, and the different agendas of college admissions people who determine who gets in, who gets wait-listed, and who doesn't have a chance.

I have show this DVD to seniors in my English classes when they first begin the application process and the laborious writing of college essays.",1424563200,,560,4.925531914893617

8019445,5,B00020HB14,"This a movie which privides a rare oppurtunity to enjoy the action application of the time honored math story problem as embodied in, 'A""& 'B'; affording the genius of Pj[hil Harman to seal the show!",1365465600,,199,4.714285714285714
8019446,3,B00020HB14,"This video is hilarious; and, as with all humor, it tends to be not too far from the truth.  Because the movie touches on fundamental areas of adolescent development and the accompanying parental attempts to deal with it, the reviews (both professional and client) tend to be harsh.  The underlying sensitive areas that are touched on may be ""too close to home.""  It is great for counselors to see as a stimulus to discussion as to how to effectively respond to regularly encountered situations.  Parents of high school freshmen and sophomores may be able to handle it because they are still somewhat distant from the experience, but junior and senior parents will tend to become defensive regarding the portrayal of the college admissions process since they are immersed in all of the complications related to college selection.",1361059200,,829,5.029197080291971
