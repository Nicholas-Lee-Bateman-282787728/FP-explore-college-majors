8302514,3,B001FRNBB2,"I have been going to warped tour since 2005 and it is quite the experience.  There is so much going on, so many wonderful people, games, contests, bands, performances, etc. etc. This DVD limits itself to a select few performances as well as interviews and some limited tour bus/backstage stuff with the bands.  I feel that warped is such a huge yearly event for so many people that SOMEONE could have captured the entirety of the event more successfully.  The live performances are WONDERFUL: Avenged Sevenfold, Coheed & Cambria, Bad Religion, Chiodos, each of them drawing me back into the wonderful day two years back.  The DVD just let me wanting A LOT MORE and not in a good way.  I've noticed that all these spectacular festivals come and go each year and we end up watching YOUTUBE videos of the them instead of getting a dvd or double dvd of each years festival....weak.",1243296000,2,877,4.6688311688311686
8302515,4,B001FRNBB2,"I'll start this review by disclaiming that I own the 2002 and 2003 DVDs as well.

This DVD is worth purchasing if you are a fan of the previous Warped Tour DVDs.  There is nothing ground breaking in this one however the Killswitch Engage live performances make this worth getting.

Theres a whole list of additional live songs in the ""extras"" section apart from the main content.

I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is a fan of Killswitch Engage, Bad Religion, Coheed & Cambria, and Pennywise.",1237075200,,499,4.636363636363637
