7813137,4,6301627687,"I ordered and bought this video a while back.  It was a fun movie to finally get to watch.  I was an extra in this movie & everyone on the set(s) were so nice.  Unfortunately, when you are an extra you don't get to see the whole movie first hand because you are moving around for different scenes. My only regret is that I didn't get to meet Ray Charles ... but I saw him in the distance. :-)",1417737600,,392,3.9367088607594938
7813138,5,6301627687,Full of interesting characters but my interest is in the Commodities market even if as just the topic behind this film. I love seeing inside what is going on on the future's trading floor.,1362873600,2,188,4.5588235294117645
7813139,4,6301627687,"I was super excited to see ""Limit Up"" available for online purchase or rental.  It has been a favorite quintessential early 90's gem for some time.  Nancy Allen gives a hysterically inspired performace as a Chicago runner at the Board of Trade who makes an inadvertant deal with the devil.  Ray Charles has a great supporting role as does Dean Stockwell.  Brad Hall and Danitra Vance, who were on ""Saturday Night Live"" at the time, round out the cast.

Here's the problem:  the digital transfer is essentially like watching an old VHS copy of ""Limit Up"" on a janky betamax in a cellar.  The sound quality is horrible as the picture looks like you need to adjust your VCR's tracking -- but you can't because ostensibly you purchased a DVD quality movie and are watching it on your computer or iPod.  ""Limit Up"" is not currently available on DVD and this version is a testament to that.

However, if like me, seeing ""Limit Up"" in any format is a hoot, then please enjoy.  Just be mentally prepared for what you are purchasing.",1263254400,3,1024,4.576923076923077
7813140,5,6301627687,"Okay, this is a little embarrassing. But Limit Up is a film I co wrote and directed, and some knucklehead attached the wrong reviews to my film. My film is about a runner at the Chicago Board of Trade (Nancy Allen, Robocop) who sells her soul to the devil (Danitra Vance) to be a successful soybean trader. Her boss (Dean Stockwell) tries to thwart her, her boyfriend (Brad Hall) tries to help her, and his boss (Rance Howard) pitches in.  Ray Charles plays God, a sax player who stands in front of the CBOT, and depending if you tip him or not, that's how well you're going to do that day. Its subplot is ending world hunger through manipulating soybean prices. That's it. It's funny (B+ from Ent. Weekly) and worth a shot.",1219276800,,724,4.443609022556391
7813141,1,6301627687,"This is a cheap copy of a video.  Lots of intereference, poor quality.  Even the cover looks cheap!  Looks like a poorly designed ?illegal copy.  Reported to Amazon and they sent another copy which was just as bad.  Don't buy...it is a waste of money!  Incidentally I love this movie but will not keep such poor quality!",1179964800,6,320,4.526315789473684
7813142,5,6301627687,"I'm a big Nancy Allen fan.  While she is predominantly identified with dramatic and action roles in films like Dressed to Kill, The Philadelphia Experiment, Out of Sight and the RoboCop trilogy, I have always been a big fan of her comedic acting.  Her supporting roles in The Buddy System and I Wanna Hold Your Hand had me rolling in the aisles.  It culminates into this farce set in early 90's Chicago.  With a fun supporting cast including Ray Charles (!), Dean Stockwell and Saturday Night Live alumni Danitra Vance and Brad Hall, this is a pretty fun movie.  If you are a fan of films that generously showcase Chicago and/or Nancy Allen, then this is a film for you.  Plus, it apparently includes a directors cut that you cannot see when watching this movie on Encore or Comedy Central.",1157673600,,790,4.607142857142857
