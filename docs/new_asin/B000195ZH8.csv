It's a ""continuing story"" (""night-time soap""), BUT story lines are resolved in approx 2 episodes, while new story line lead-ins are well done.  The variety of sub-plots among the characters is entertaining and humerous.  Rich in story!
As mentioned by others, my only disappointment was missing ""Scene-Selection"" Feature in the Bonus Features.",1108598400,,605,4.97029702970297
8008677,5,B000195ZH8,"Fantastic series. Well-written and acted, and quite fun with some of the recognizable Montreal scenery & culture as well. Much deserving of a wide audience, though the couple dubbed English episodes included on a later series disc make it clear that if you need the English version, which I do, let it be via subtitles, which are present on all the Series I-IV discs that I have, contrary to the other review here.",1097280000,,414,4.684931506849315
