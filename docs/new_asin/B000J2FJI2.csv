2666535,5,B000J2FJI2,This is a lot of fun.  The sound quality is really good and it contains the best version of Rhiannon that I've ever seen.,1229299200,6,121,4.041666666666667
2666536,5,B000J2FJI2,"I have been wondering when these Midnight Special DVDs were going to start showing up used here on Amazon. I remember watching this show while growing up, along with Don Kirshner and, later, Nightflight and After Hours. The MS producers have quite a few DVDs out so far, 2 for each year 1973-1980! One with the year and one called ""More"" with the same year. Of course some are far better than others and I am not going to review every single one but will probably, eventually, post for the ones I think are the best.

There's some truly amazing stuff on some of them! The usual suspects are all here (Fleetwood Mac, The Doobie Brothers, Heart, The Ohio Players and The Brothers Johnson from the mid-70s are priceless!!) AND.... ....Imagine the original line-up of Edgar Winter's White Trash doing a 12 minute improv of the classic Frankenstein!! Edgar plays keyboards, sax and drums at various times and Ronnie Montrose is so young he looks like a teenager!!

Also, not only ""Show me the way"" but Frampton's classic ""Do you feel like we do"" - And not the usual castrated version we used to see on TV either!! The full-blown 12-15 minute version that's on his classic Comes Alive album. Probably recorded around the same time too considering it's on the ""More 1975"" volume.

Great stuff though I was initially wary of the price (originally $43 for 2 discs including shipping). But, in hindsight, that probably wasn't so bad considering what people are wanting for some of these used copies!!! And I do see the 1st 2 discs they sent me on here; ""Million sellers"" and an all Comedy disc. The individual years began after that, again, 2 at a time.

The bottom line is they are MUST HAVES for fans of ANY genre of 70s music, these discs are that good and all are remastered in 5.1 too boot!! As a bonus each disc also has 2 stand-up comedian clips - that's right - people like Pryor, Carlin and many, many others in their prime!

Enjoy!!",1193875200,47,1932,4.556195965417867
2666537,5,B000J2FJI2,"Watching the live 1970s TV performances that I missed in my early 20s, (didnt go to concerts either) only enhanced my enjoyment of this album. Most of the artists were my age then,yet I was aware that their talent represented breakthrough music for a new generation, space exploration, and the new transience of relationships . What stands out were the performances of David Bowie in his Alladin Sane phase, the steve miller band, Blondie, Donna Summer, Fleetwood Mac, Linda Ronstadt, Peter Frampton and Al Green. The performers were in the prime of their youth performing their million dollar sellers with  their original musicians or duet partners as with David Bowie or Peter Frampton and their own original lyrics. They seemed fresh, and their voices were confident. They had fun being with so many other acts on the same night and the audience was small enough to be intimate. They were on a par with seeing Elton John live with a great band 1 1/2 years ago at MSG for a Katrina benefit. The great camera angles caught the light in their eyes and their smiles as though I had a front row seat.",1166918400,26,1098,4.689119170984456

This series of DVDs brings it all back! I could ""geek out"" for hours, watching live performances from the days when all artists really sang and hardly any looked like supermodels.

I can't begin to describe the wonderful feelings of nostalgia the Midnight Special DVDs have brought. I can't wait to watch the entire series!

I would highly recommend this series to any true music lover! Y",1401148800,4,528,4.6063829787234045

2666552,4,B000J2FJI2,"There are fifteen (15) performances on this DVD release in Burt Sugarmans The Midnight Special series. The disc opens with Roy Orbison doing his classic Oh, Pretty Woman, followed by Stevie Nicks and Fleetwood Mac who perform Rhiannon. Peter Framptons Baby I Love Your Way took me all the way back to Holland, 1976 where I spent a part of that summer studying at the ISS in The Hague. It was where I heard the song for the first time.

From the first (Orbison) to the last singer Donna Summer each artist is captured on this disc at the height of his/her fame and these are all stars in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame today (or on the way). Al Green, Aretha Franklin, Patti La Belle and Donna Summer (representing R&Bs best) all make appearances on this compilation.

For performances recorded in the 1970s the audio/video quality is pretty good and this particular release in the series deserves a blue ray edition. You won't believe how good the Queen of Soul looked early in her career.

The lineup: Roy Orbison, Fleetwood Mac, Peter Frampton, John Denver & Cass Elliot, The Bee Gees, Linda Ronstadt, The Guess Who, Al Green, Aretha Franklin, David Bowie, Blondie, Patti La Belle, The Steve Miller Band, Billy Joel, Donna Summer.",1367798400,8,1232,4.668202764976958
2666553,4,B000J2FJI2,"Seeing all these iconic artist performing live is a wonderful experience and if I could afford to buy the full collection at once I would.  But if you can only get one disc at a time, this is the one to start.  You'll watch it over and over again and play it for your friends, especially if you have a good audio system. the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's not in 5.1 audio.  That would have made it perfect for me.

My recommendation is to get this DVD and start reviewing the list to see which one you'll get next.",1359849600,4,537,4.037735849056604
2666554,5,B000J2FJI2,"If you buy no other Burt Sugarman's ""The Midnight Special"" show let it be THE MIDNIGHT SPECIAL: MILLION SELLERS DVD! This DVD is packed with performances by the original artists and as the title says these were the B-I-G hits of the 70s.

You get to see live performances of The Guess Who? doing ""American Woman,"" Roy Orbison doing ""Pretty Woman,"" Aretha Franklin doing ""Respect,"" OK so some songs didn't originate in the 70s, but still, you get wonderful live performances that are priceless!

Other stand out performances include Labelle doing ""Lady Marmalade,"" complete with their silver space outfits on, Blondie doing ""Heart Of Glass,"" and Donna Summer performing ""Last Dance,"" which includes the star talking about her upcoming film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thank-God-It-s-Friday/dp/B000EAT23W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thank God It's Friday</a>.

Unlike some other collections that feature many of the performers lip synching (like ""Soul Train"") or have the performers doing their hits, but filmed in the present day, MIDNIGHT SPECIAL: MILLION SELLERS captures the artists as they were: talented, gifted, and dynamic! Also, these are the complete performance of the song, so it isn't just clips.

The one thing that's annoying is that you have to watch the credits after each number because these performances were taken from various shows, but there's a ""play-all"" feature or just ""performance"" selection.

For those of us who were too young to remember or watch this show, I recommend buying this DVD! Especially if you like retro music! And this was when a person became famous for having talent, not like today where anyone can be famous for nothing.",1309996800,6,1712,5.5440613026819925
