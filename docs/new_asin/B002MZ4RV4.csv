3953140,4,B002MZ4RV4,"This CD was recommended by a friend -- it's a great little work out for those days that you don't feel like leaving the house to exercise. Easy, fun, fast(30 minutes and you've done a 2 mile arobic walk). I found the beat of the music a little too soft for my old ears, so I'd prefer louder music.  Or, even better, a selection of music you'd like to hear while exercising.",1344211200,,373,4.180555555555555
3953141,5,B002MZ4RV4,"This DVD has been the answer to my prayers! I finally decided to order it after not being able to find any other 30 minute workouts that take on beginner level without the routines or instructors being boring. This DVD is meant for beginners but anyone at any level can use this to their advantage. I am an intermediate + exerciser and this DVD is perfect what I need. I was looking for something like I said, about 30 minutes in length that I could use on rest and recovery days. I also needed a workout that I could use when sick, tired, or using earlier in the day as I go to the gym 2-3 nights per week with my husband. When I use it on Gym days, it's perfect for the fact that I am not exhorting myself but getting in some solid movements that keep my energized and prevent stiffness and boredom. I am still strong enough to lift heavy or do some aggressive/long workouts in the evening if need be. Beginners will find that it is perfect as well. The pace of the DVD is mild and the fastest pace is bwt Minutes 10 & 19. This will leave you feeling proud and accomplished without overtraining or draining you!

Minute 10 like I said is the start of the light-moderate pace
Minute 14 is Mile Marker 1
Minute 19 is the fastest the pace will get
Minute 23 begins cool down
Minute 28 Mile Marker 2 followed by stretch

Leslie says ""there will never be a time when you say I wish I hadn't exercised"". I have to agree if you walk with Leslie; you can't help but feel amazing afterwards. I will disagree only from the stance that I have had exercise DVDs that I tried and couldn't stand after 1 use. I felt tired, exhausted, and there have been times I was injured by the crazy choreography or unsafe movements done with high impact or risky weight lifting form. I have quite a collection of DVDs and most I have or am selling off from either just that or bc I find them boring. Leslie won't match the intensity of let's say Cathe Friedrich, Kelly Coffee-Meyer, or even many of the Firm and Firm Pink DVDs. What she does though do is provide you with fitness that is healthful and easy on the body all while helping to take you to the next level. This DVD will help get the beginner into the next stage of her other, faster 2 Mile DVDs, and eventually into the strength and endurance miles. She takes the Intermediate and bumps them into the advanced category. If you're Advanced, she keeps you safely conditioned as her 4 Basic Steps are founded on Functional Fitness; nothing risky or possibly harmful to you inside-out.

As a side note: Leslie mentions to do this 3 Days per week if you are just starting out. If you are looking for weight loss and wanting to build endurance, do this 4-5 days per week. Just like her other DVDs and Systems, even her books talk about 5 days per week being about all you need for weight loss and better health. Just build up your miles and intensity and try new activities to keep your mind and body engaged.

Leslie is my life saver and her fitness DVDs have taken me from recovering from surgery (major loss of strength and endurance) to feeling fabulous after her 3 Mile DVDs! As I progress, I will be back at my level of fitness, doing Walk Slim 4 Fast Miles without breathing too heavily. I can't thank her enough!

This is a great DVD for using as a building block or a recovery day. Its uses are limitless! I'd even say this one would be perfect for pregnant women in their 2-3 trimesters to keep you moving safely and comfortably. This was well worth the money and I can see this DVD being used often! I'd even pair it with some relaxing yoga or her pilates segment from 3 Mile Slim & Sleek Walk. The possibilities are endless!",1260835200,16,3668,4.30246020260492
3953142,5,B002MZ4RV4,"I personally have purchased 3 copies of this DVD, one for my mother, one for my best friend, and one for myself.  It is an excellent way for beginners to get started on an regular exercise routine.  The moves are basic and doable!  Having Leslie performing alone gives it the feel of having a personal trainer. She is always encouraging.",1255219200,2,337,4.583333333333333
3953143,5,B002MZ4RV4,"Walk this Way is an excellent introduction to walk aerobics, and is a wonderful workout for those brand new to exercise or those who need to take it easy. You'll appreciate this workout only if you understand what it is. The level of ""beginner"" is correctly labeled. If you exercise daily (intermediate/advanced), you may be disappointed if you are expecting this workout to give you a real challenge. I am an intermediate, low-impact exerciser who uses Leslie's workouts daily. If I put all my energy into this walk, then I always get a decent, energizing workout. However, I usually use this particular DVD when I need something really light, am not feeling well, or if I just want a gentle walk. I even use this as an add-on when I have done a more intense workout and feel energized and want to keep going but don't want something more intense. After a good workout day, this walk is often like a ""stroll in the park"" for me. And I need that every now and then. It's a stress-reliever and gets me to move when I don't feel like it! I think true beginners will get a challenge. But I do believe all levels can appreciate and benefit from this walk if they know how to appropriately insert it into their fitness program.",1253404800,8,1222,4.509009009009009

8374297,5,B002MZ4RV4,"This is a great 2-mile tape. While it's not a jazzy as her other tapes, it gets the job done. It's a very solid and basic 2-mile walk with her usual marches, side steps, knee lifts and kicks. No choreography to confuse you. The music is not as invigorating as in her other tapes, but again, not a huge deal. All in all a solid workout that will make you break a sweat but not completely wipe you out.",1469059200,,400,4.075949367088608

8374303,5,B002MZ4RV4,Needed something to fill in days when I couldn't go to the fitness club. This workout makes me feel as tho I accomplished something but only takes about 20 min. Do this a.m. and yoga p.m. and I've worked out  without leaving home.,1366502400,,230,4.348837209302325
