682934,1,6303522491,"Like Fitzgerald and his perfect Gatsby,  Fellini learned early on how to set up a deeply satisfying ending. 8 1/2, La Dolce Vita. Cabiria. Wow! What wonderful endings.
On that note, this movie is political. It seriously questions the idea of marriage. But we only realize this in the final scene. And we know it because of a few clues.
First is the word play. The Taxi driver asks to be paid, and the uncle asks Ivan, ?Are you done paying?? I?m guessing Ivan has just begun to pay for his decision ? to get married.
Then there is the classic Fellini image of procession.  The couple is reunited in the end, they have gotten away with their little embarrassment, unscathed, and they run to catch up with the rest of humanity on it's insanely habitual march to who-knows-where. This is an image which comes back many times with Fellini and is certainly intentional.
And finally is the obvious alignment up of the taunting flute-trill, at the end of the score, with the image of the statue looking down on man, creating a moment of laughter, or even mockery, from above. This moment is essential to understanding this movie, and is well intact in the VHS copy, but on the DVD the music has been shifted, so the music and image of the statue no longer line up! Seem trivial? Perhaps. God knows Criterion has made the world a much, much better place, so I don't blame them. But I believe the mistake is there.
All the same this is a great movie and the extra features are nice.",1019001600,6,1472,4.4684014869888475
682935,5,6303522491,"A most comic and human film, ""The White Sheik"" was apparently Fellini's first and, for sheer enjoyment, beats anything he did after the great ""Nights of Cabiria."" It made me laugh almost non-stop from start to finish.
Ivan and Wanda are a young newlywed couple from a small town-- checking into a hotel in Rome.  Ivan, rather nervous and ambitious, has their honeymoon planned to the minuto--most to be spent with his relatives, including Uncle who has connections to the Vatican.  Wanda, a dreamer, is taken by stories and pictures in a certain periodical.  She learns from the porter the location of the publisher is only 10 minutes away. She can't resist! When Ivan takes a nap she is off for a visit.  Arriving, she soon finds the characters of her dream stories in the flesh and in costume, for they are preparing to make a film.  Felga!  Oscar! The Cruel Bedouin!  Most of all Wanda wants to meet the White Sheik for she has made a drawing of him and wants him to have it.
In the meantime Ivan, thinking Wanda was in the bath, awakens to find her gone. The relatives (all of them) soon arrive. Ivan, so anxious to show off his new wife, is perplexed at her absence and doesn't know what to say to the family.  One comic event after another follows.
In a memorable scene, Ivan meets Cabiria (yes, the one we know) although he does not initiate or even consummate an affair with her as another reviewer claims.  To do so would be totally out of character.
Speaking of characters, there is a great supporting cast--from the hotel clerk (""Postcard?""); the respectable Uncle (""Man to man...tell me what's happening""); the film director (shouting: ""Take out the concubines!  Bring on the camel!""); and, of course, the White Sheik, a sort of 1950s Flavio with his square jawed good looks and rich mane of hair.  This is a great film and is highly recommended.",1012953600,9,1858,4.617021276595745
682936,5,6303522491,"While honeymooning in Rome, a young bride (Wanda),dazzled by glamour and illusion, escapes the security of her future by running off with a photo-novel actor who portrays a seductive ""White Sheik"", to whom  she writes often signing herself as ""the pasionate doll"". Soon,  she finds reality sneaking into her romantic fantasy. Disappointed by the  average quality of her idol, she goes back to her husband (Trieste) who,  meanwhile, has initiated an affair with a prostitute (Cabiria) and her  friend. This is the first film for which Fellini has completely  responsibility as a director: Through the vicissitude of little provincial  persons who discover factory-dreams, Fellini inaugurates that  autobiographic element and that fancy inclination which will be constant of  his cinemas. Sordi (the ""White Sheik"") is an irresistible  seductor to excess while at the same time enslaved by his wife.",949449600,2,896,5.427536231884058
682937,4,6303522491,"""The White Sheik"" is about a young couple on their honeymoon. Ivan and Wanda Cavalli go to Rome, so she can meet his family, but, what Ivan doesn't know is, she secretly wants to meet ""The White Sheik"" (Alberto Sordi), a comic book character! Wanda (Brunella Bovo) sneaks out of their room to go find ""The Sheik"". And Ivan (Leopoldo Trieste) is stuck trying to figure out a good excuse as to why his bride can't see his family. For a foreign movie, and for a film made by Fellini, this is actually quite funny. Their are nice performances by the characters, and good directing by Fellini. This would make a nice start in your collection of Fellini's films.
 The script was done by four people, including Fellini, but, also fammed Italian director Michelango Antonioni co-wrote this script as well! And anyone familiar with him will find this to be a shock. Also Giulietta Masina (Fellini's wife) is in this movie as well. She plays a character named Cabiria. Fellini would later make a movie around this character in his masterpiece ""Nights of Cabiria"".",947030400,4,1053,4.7228260869565215

7850370,4,6303522491,"The White Sheik (1952) was Federico Fellinis first solo effort as film director and is the centerpiece of what Fellini expert Peter Bondanella calls his Trilogy of Character. The first (Variety Lights [1950]) was co-directed with Alberto Lattuada and the third (I Vitelloni [1953]) was the film that really put Fellini on the map as a film director of significance. All three films focus on atypical willfully eccentric characters and the clash between the public role (the 'face') they have to maintain to get along in society and their more authentic real selves as expressed through fantasies, ideals, dreams and instincts. The White Sheik constitutes a great jump in the technical level of the film-making from the comparatively simple Variety Lights. In the final analysis it is a sophisticated comedy and much more than just the curiosity that many take it for. Woody Allen for one liked it enough to remake it in 2012 as To Rome with Love.

Michelangelo Antonioni was the unlikely original source for the material that became The White Sheik. When he saw what Fellini, Pinelli and Flaiano did with his sogetto (story) it's no surprise that he washed his hands of the project. A very un-Antonionian light social comedy, the film is the story of a couple from the provinces whose honeymoon in Rome turns into a complete disaster. Ivan (a superb wide-eyed comic turn from Leopold Trieste) is a minor civil servant, a stickler for social propriety who has his visit to the city planned down to the tiniest micro-second. He plans to exhibit his wife to his family, do the main tourist sights, take in an opera and pay a visit to the Pope at St. Peter's along with 200 other couples  all within 24 hours. Completely obsessed with maintaining 'face' in front of others his character is absurd to the extreme. His equally absurd wife Wanda (a beautifully observed study of air-head romantic delusion by Brunella Bovo) has her own secret agenda. Avid devourer of exotic fotoromanzi (novels consisting of photos of models acting out romantic stories) she plans to visit the office of Incanto Blu (Blue Romance) to see her favorite star Fernando Rivoli (an outrageously tacky Alberto Sordi) who plays the white sheik of the title, an ex-butchers boy and cut-price Valentino wannabe. Her head in the clouds, Wanda allows herself to be swept up in the current photo shoot taking place miles away from Rome. The film proceeds as a clash between a man concerned with maintaining 'face' and a woman concerned with cashing in her face for exotic adventures which reflect her real desires. Both social attitudes lead to disaster as Fellini skillfully cuts between their parallel stories starting with their initial estrangement (Wanda taking flight almost immediately after checking in to their hotel) and finishing with their eventual reunion on the steps of St. Peter's.

Whether you find the exploits depicted here funny or irritating will depend on your sense of humor. Initially a box office flop, the film is now often celebrated by critics as a comic masterpiece. Though certainly amusing throughout, my judgment of it falls somewhere in between, possibly because I find the main characters both annoying and unsympathetic. Wandas adventures on the beach (her initial encounter with her sheik on a stylized swing, her dressing up as a harem sex slave for the brilliantly edited photo story shoot, a boat trip with Rivoli which has her fighting off his lecherous paws and the encounter with his enormous wife) are certainly more entertaining (and closer to the later Fellini style of La Dolce Vita) than Ivans face-saving attempts at hiding his wifes flight from his family, though he does get a gem of a sequence where he reports her disappearance to the police in such a manner as to cause them to think he should be institutionalized.

More interesting than the story though is the bravura with which Fellini tells it. As Bondanella points out in his highly recommended book on Fellini (The Cinema of Federico Fellini [1992, Princeton Univ. Press]), the film consists of continually flicking back and forth between parallel narratives which comment ironically on each other in a sophisticated montage which (though brilliantly achieved) Fellini never used again. Good examples include cutting from Wanda at the Incanto Blu office saying she wants to meet her white sheik to Ivan in the hotel meeting a black man who speaks gibberish; from Wanda getting caught up in a procession of actors all dressed up in mufti to Ivan getting caught up in a procession of soldiers on the street as he looks for his wife; from Wanda playing the role of sex slave to Ivan playing the role of concerned husband telephoning his sick wife from a restaurant where he is entertaining his family; from Wanda stuck in the ocean on a boat with a lecherous Don Juan to (courtesy of a hilarious crack on Rivolis head from the boom) Ivan stuck in the opera watching (you guessed it) Don Giovanni; and then from Wanda rejecting the advances of another man who drives her back to Rome to Ivan ironically accepting the advances of a prostitute. The film ostensibly sets out to portray the story of a moral man betrayed by his errant wife on their honeymoon, but ends up showing the betrayed being the betrayer, as he lies to his wife on the way to meeting the Pope with an angel blessing them ironically in the films closing image. The White Sheik is a very clever film put together with considerable skill and is thoroughly worth seeing though of course Fellini went on to greater things. Check out Giulietta Masina playing one of the prostitutes Ivan meets. Named Cabiria, the same character will be the main subject of The Nights of Cabiria four Fellini films later.

Potential buyers should be aware that this film is available in a 3 DVD boxed set from Optimum World/Studio Canal which also includes La Strada (1954) and The Nights of Cabiria (1957). I picked mine up for just 9 making it an outstanding bargain. The transfer quality of all three films is excellent, pristine b/w pictures and clear sound. Early Fellini is unmissable for lovers of cinema and buying this set is a no-brainer even if you already have La Strada.",1424649600,,6199,4.872037914691943
7850371,4,6303522491,"THE WHITE SHEIK is a low-budget film set in early 1950s Rome.  It concerns a newly-wed couple Ivan (Leopoldo Trieste) and Wanda (Brunella Bovo) who arrive in the city for their honeymoon.  Ivan has the arrangements all planned - they will meet his uncle and aunt, see the Pope, visit the sights and enjoy a quiet evening in.  However things start to go off the rails when Wanda decides to look for her hero the White Sheik (Alberto Sordi), star of a series of comic-books and films.  Her enthusiasm leads her astray from the hotel and into a series of adventures involving her being transported to the film-set, being taken on a boat with the Sheik, lost in the wilderness and taken back to Rome in a strongman's automobile.  Ivan tries to look for her, but ends up in a series of adventures of his own as he desperately tries to convince his relatives that everything is perfectly serene in his marital life.  Fellini's film rebounds from misadventure to misadventure; it is in fact extremely funny, with wonderful performances from the three leading actors, all of whom understand the importance of gesture and facial expression.  Fellini spent his early years working with clowns; it's clear that this experience informs the film.  THE WHITE SHEIK has a relatively short running-time - just over 80 minutes - but it is well worth watching.",1374364800,3,1342,4.779220779220779
7850372,4,6303522491,"This is a delightful Frederico Fellini Criterion Collection black and white Italian movie.  A just-married nervous couple from the countryside arrives in Rome where the husband (Ivan) has arranged to introduce his bride (Wanda) to important family relatives, tour major attractions, and meet the Pope. The bride, however has her own ideas about what is important to see in Rome, and they include a quick visit to a magazine studio where she has been corresponding with an actor known for his highly romantic photographed role as the White Sheik.  Unbeknownst to Ivan, Wanda is utterly star-struck by this actor, avidly reading every magazine and memorizing verbatim all his stories.

The movie has hilarious moments that stand the test of time.  When Wanda disappears and Ivan has no idea what has happened to her, he is forced into the most ridiculous excuses to cover her absence.  Wanda meanwhile has actually met the White Sheik and initially his charm is every bit as potent as his magazine image and soon she finds herself starring with him.

As Wanda's fantasy fades in the face of reality, we see the white sheik as he really is: an overly vain buffoon. The story is imaginative, funny and touching, and apparently Fellini's debut as a director.  Well-worth watching.",1241481600,2,1275,4.985849056603773

7850374,4,6303522491,"This is a glorious trasfer of one of Fellini's earliest films.  This film is much more simple and light than many of Fellini's subsequent films, but it has a charm all of its own.  The fairly straightforward story holds very few surprises or twists, but it also a nice exploration of fantasy vs. reality.  The introduction of the White Sheik sitting in his swing, high in the air is a wonderful moment. As the film goes on, the dashing sheik just becomes to us an overweight and vain man and our illusions, like the young wife's, are dashed.  Variations of this story have been done many times, but this is one of the most pure and enjoyable.
The film is also notable for the introduction of Cabiria (Giulietta Masina) who would have her own Fellini film a few years after.  It's not a very long scene, and it is included in its entirety on the ""Nights of Cabiria"" DVD by Criterion.  Despite that, this is still a DVD worth owning to watch a master filmmaker get used to his craft.",1052092800,10,981,4.4222222222222225
7850375,4,6303522491,"THE WHITE SHEIK is Federico Fellini's 1951 solo directorial debut. When I think of a Fellini movie, the first things that come to mind are: the image of someone in diaphanous material floating across the screen, people in antiquated circus-like costumes and a main character who escapes into a fantasy that turns out to have a poignant impact in his or her real life.  All these elements are part of the texture of The White Sheik.
A provincial couple come to Rome on their honeymoon. Ivan the groom has made an unromantic schedule of appointments for them. Wanda the young bride, an avid fan of the widely read soap opera photo-comic strips called fumetti, sneaks out of the hotel for a few hours to meet her comic book idol, The White Sheik, and give him a drawing she made. It's all innocent but one thing leads to another and she inadvertently gets taken to a distant photo shoot where the sleazy actor playing the sheik comes on to the bride, now dressed as a harem girl.  Meanwhile in Rome, her distraught husband seeks to keep his bride's disappearance a secret from visiting relatives and a scheduled visit with the pope. Look for Fellini's wife, actress Giulietta Masina in a small role as the prostitute Cabiria. A few years later, Masina starred in Fellini's masterpiece, the heartbreaking NIGHTS OF CABIRIA (Criterion).  Nino Rota, who became a long term Fellini collaborator, composed the evocative score.
The White Shiek has suffered little over time. I think Fellini saw life as a bittersweet fantasy full of slapstick and hope. A pretty good definition.
Additional material includes a recent interview with the two stars who reminisce about their magical time with Fellini in Rome half a century ago.  Recommended",1051833600,6,1729,4.870748299319728
