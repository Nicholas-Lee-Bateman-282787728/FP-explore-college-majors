4330055,5,B004CYF7HQ,"The egg trick with Dom and Johnny was hilarious. And Burt and Art rounded out the craziness!
Only wish they didn't edit the show and you could see all of it!",1374364800,,157,4.096774193548387
4330056,3,B004CYF7HQ,"Its worth watching if you're a Carson fan. He admittedly had a bad monologue, but Dom D picks things up followed by Burt R and then Art C comes in and all craziness is let loose. Doc S is in his usual cool form.",1373587200,2,211,3.8181818181818183
4330057,4,B004CYF7HQ,"Although I think it would be better to have episodes in their entirety, this was a terrific trip down memory lane. The segment featuring Dom Deluise is hilarious. The antics spill over to Burt's appearance, and then Art Carney brings it all home. Very Funny.",1358294400,,258,4.7555555555555555
4330058,2,B004CYF7HQ,"Not worth the price for thirty minutes run time.  The quality and sound is good. Nice to see celebrities, but this series of The Tonight Show is just too short.  The epidsode featuring Bob Hope was Mr. Bob Hope promoting an upcoming show of his and Mr. Bob Hope was off.",1329004800,2,270,4.2745098039215685
4330059,5,B004CYF7HQ,"When I first saw that they were now releasing individual episodes of the ""Tonight Show"" starring Johnny Carson, I honestly wasn't quite sure what to expect.  So I ordered five different episodes to start with and this was one of them.  I'm telling you now that I couldn't possibly be more pleased.  This particular episode with Burt Reynolds, Dom DeLuise and Art Carney is one of the BEST, and certainly one of the funniest EVER recorded. Not only that, the quality of this particular DVD is truly outstanding, especially when you consider that this was made from the original tapes of a show that was broadcast on NBC over 36 years ago.  It's truly amazing. I'd honestly rate the quality of this DVD a ""9"" on a scale of ""1 to 10"", with a ""10"" being the highest. Sure, it's not quite as good as a show in that is recorded in HD quality, but it's really great.
The only issue that I have with them releasing individual episodes like this is that I'm going to go broke real quick.  If I had the money, I'd order EVERY episode of the original ""Tonight Show"" that comes out like this.  I truly can't wait to watch the other four episodes that I ordered.  EXCELLENT - EXCELLENT - EXCELLENT.  Please don't pass this one up, or you're truly going to miss one of the greatest episodes of the original ""Tonight Show"", that was ever recorded.  I truly loved it.
I just discovered that you can only write ONE review regarding all of the single episodes.  So - This review also covers the single episode with Frank Sintara and another single episode with Sammy Davis Jr.  BOTH of these two episodes are also EXCELLENT.  It's truly like taking a trip back in time. This is exactly like watching the ""Tonight Show"" live in the 1970's. It appears that all single episodes even include the Johnny's opening monolog and all of his guests for that night (minus the commercials).
After watching these first three episodes, there is no doubt at all that I will buying a lot more of these.  The only question is - Which ones to buy, since they're ALL incredible.
I'd give all of these 10 STARS if I could.",1291420800,13,2084,4.467018469656992
8423820,4,B004CYF7HQ,Bit expensive but I watched this episode because I am reading Burt Reynolds new book which I bought form Amazon,1484784000,,111,4.6
8423821,4,B004CYF7HQ,"I saw this the other night on an oldies channel and wanted my husband to see it, so we rented it. Although the description says it's edited and is only 40+ minutes long, I didn't notice it at the time I ordered it. Johnny, Dom DeLuise, Burt Reynolds, and Art Carney are hysterical. What they edited out was the Ace Trucking Company, a comedy troupe featuring Fred Willard. That was also  very entertaining and a walk down memory lane to see Willard in his early days. Again, what is shown is very good; just wish they had shown the show in its entirety.",1468800000,,553,4.368932038834951
8423822,5,B004CYF7HQ,we ordered this dvd from amazon and it came yesterday. We watched it last night. It was a classic episode where the clothes they all wore were ridiculous and so ugly they were funny! !  No wonder i was only 4 when this was taped. My teenage daughter laughed and liked it also. The egg trick and whip cream did make a mess! They had a lot of fun on this classic episode,1468022400,,368,4.041095890410959

8423827,5,B004CYF7HQ,What a fun time. Carson was just the master and this video is an excellent example. It perfect for remembering what classy comedy really is.,1401667200,,140,4.64
8423828,5,B004CYF7HQ,"Johnny Carson is a classic. I loved watching him again. I will buy more episodes and recommend them to others.
Great memories. The fun starts with Johnny and Dom DeLuise and it continues with Burt Reynolds and Art Carney,
They keep you in stitches. A must see.",1393027200,,260,4.553191489361702
8423829,4,B004CYF7HQ,"This was the best show on TV for many, many years. It is good to see it on the Internet now. I have waited for all the shows to come out and now they are here. Granted viewing them now is not the same as seeing them the first time. But, it brings back many memories, of a happier younger life. Congratulations to the people that finally put this up on the Internet for everyone to view. Thank you!",1376870400,,397,4.037974683544304
