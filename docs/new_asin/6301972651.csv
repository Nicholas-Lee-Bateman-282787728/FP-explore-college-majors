401507,4,6301972651,"This is an example of a movie that has an average script but is saved by the acting. Not only Sissy Spacek, who can elevate any script, but also Art Carney and Jane Wyatt of TV's ""Father Knows Best"" fame make it a moving film experience. It could have been a self-pitying liberal mess but is actually a pretty good examination of what happened to make some American upper middle class white kids become America-hating anarchist bombers in the 1960s.",1021939200,5,449,4.625

A made-for-TV offering, the story packs a very strong (if sometimes melodramatic) punch, especially poignant considering it was made at the time the subject matter (violent domestic protests) were actually happening.  Spacek's father is played very seriously by Art Carney, of The Honeymooner's Ed Norton fame, and though competent in a serious role, I think he's better as a comedian, which is probably typecasting, but nevertheless, his part here is far less memorable and unimportant that his Honeymooner character ever was for Jackie Gleason, and might have been better played by a less well-known character actor.",1417219200,,759,5.415254237288136

As a young child, around Todd's age, during the making of this movie I only heard talk of some of the similar events in this film but, understood less the significance of Revolutionary Idealist contribution or their dedication to trying to make life better for others in this world. Now after Gulf War Games I and II, Corporate Bailouts, and the Too Big to Fail Bank Hustle etc.. etc.. I don't understand why anyone would give a one star rating and say they think the storyline of this movie is ""Stupid"".

401593,5,6301972651,"Based on a true story of Diana Houghton, of the Weather Underground, Sissy Spacek delivers an Oscar worthy performance. Art Carney plays the ""ultra rich"" Father, opposed to his daughter's politics and decisions, but actually supportive, on some levels. As expected, he, too, is excellent. Henry Winkler is the [Seinfeld reference]  ""opposite"" of ""the Fonz"".

She decides to work in South America instead of go to Graduate School. Courageous and knowlegable, she cannot sustain there when the embassy agrees with the locals that she is ...trouble.

She returns, radicalized in her head..then radicalized, in action.

One might assume this film is based upon the Patty Hearst story...it may be closer to the Jane Fonda story (c. 1970 to 1973) and actually have some similarity (in parts) to the Amy Carter jailing scenario.

I've known one or two American radical feminists who had strong passions re; justice based ideas and activism; I knew an American woman who called herself a revolutionary. The 60s radicalized a lot of people. But the movie doesn't go into the depth of revolutionary thought, and even not much attempt to capture any of the psychedelic imagery of the time; in my opinion, the story-line fails to make a correlation between her early years in the south American jungles, her radicalization and the extreme ending.

Showed the progression of a do-gooder truly trying to help the world turning into a radical who didn't mind blowing up the world. So many people went down that road.  In the end, I felt more sorrow for Katherine's family than for Katherine. She chose her own path. Anyway, I bought the Katherine DVD and received a movie in black and white. Katherine was originally in color back in the 70's, and Katherine is supposed to be in color according to the DVD case.  Anyone else have this problem?  Amazon gave me a refund so money isn't the issue.  I'm just afraid that if I buy the Katherine DVD again, the same thing will happen and I won't get a refund this time.

401640,4,6301972651,"Katherine, 1975 film

The movie begins with a view of San Francisco in September 1972. There is a house with people who have an alarm clock connected to sticks of ""dynamite"". Katie's father talks about his daughter. Katie's mother talks about her young life. Did she get involved with a bad crowd? Was she too proud to admit a mistake? Katherine dresses in disguise to plant a time bomb. She came from a very wealthy family. Was she head-strong? She volunteers to teach children to read. A girlfriend marries her boyfriend so he won't be drafted. Instead of graduate school she wants to help people in South America. There are flashbacks to the news of 1965. Katy teaches children to read, then adults too. She experiences rural life and sees the oppression by a big landowner who doesn't want education for the people. [Ignorant people are easier to control.]

She learns about political oppression when a man is shot on the street. She travels to the mountains, where people seek refuge. Can change occur without guns and ammunition? Katie learns the realities of feudal life. Is she too arrogant? What about life in America? Katie becomes serious and bitter over what she saw. Donated food from America was being sold. The Embassy tells her she is being expelled that very day! She learned a lesson. People saw how she changed. Someone has lost his ranch (due to a personal fault). She volunteers to teach poor children at a school in the South, and learns about life there. The Fire Inspector closes the school. She learns about the attitude of the people she wants to help. ""Do you believe all that?"" ""You can't love a system you are trying to destroy."" Katie becomes a member of the SDS and visits colleges to organize.

Will Katie have a child? She returns home with Bob to meet her parents. ""A martini."" ""Yes, he is."" ""What is a normal life?"" Bob talks to Katie's father. ""What is life about?"" Katie has become radicalized. Bob is agreeable. Katie is told about her grandfather (before he got rich). She wants to change the system. [Are people kept misinformed so they can be controlled?] ""Be careful"" says her father. Does their wealth come from other people's poverty? There is news from 1968. Katie goes to Chicago and meets an old friend, they discuss their lives. Katie is changing. The police throw tear gas then club the demonstrators. ""Katie, be careful!"" But she is arrested and put in jail. Katie makes a decision about her body. [Is this a sign of too much pride?] Did some people see what they wanted to see?

Who is that man following Katie? Nixon took over in 1969. There is a meeting where people argue over the correct methods for political resistance. Slogans? ""Carpe diem""? Can Katie get more money from her Dad? They buy stolen guns. Will Katie join a ""collective""? Bob left for Canada to avoid arrest. Katie went underground with a new identity. Nixon invaded Cambodia in 1970. Katie lost touch with her family. The group tries new tactics. Their invasion of a school leads to arrests. Katie returns home (remembrance?). She has a new attitude. ""Are there any old revolutionaries?"" asks her Mom. Does Katie understand herself? She writes a farewell letter to her parents. We hear an explosion outside that museum. Next we see comments from her friends and relatives. Could she have found another way?
There is a moral to this story ""inspired by true events"". Know your limits. Don't depend solely on advice from people who think like you do; its not objective.",1339804800,,3488,4.7319078947368425

For anyone else who is interested in studying this time period, I recommend this film, the documentary called The Weather Underground, Network and Across the Universe. I think together these films do a pretty good job painting a portrait of that period in American history.",1315440000,,871,4.512658227848101
401642,4,6301972651,"This should be interesting to anyone who has a decent understanding of what REALLY went down with the Weather Underground and revolutionary struggle in the late 1906s & early 1970s. This, apparently made-for-TV drama, clearly blends events revolving around a number of different individuals into a single character (some Weatherwomen in particular, which is being implied with the title of the movie). It surprisingly does a pretty thorough job at briefly explaining a number of the political concepts and evolutions that many experienced during those years of struggle. But don't be mistaken, this is a B-movie by any definition (although the Fonz honestly shows some acting ability in here, which was a highlight). While I personally enjoyed this, I would surely not substitute it for any real historical information.. especially the ending.",1242691200,,843,5.393939393939394

401644,1,6301972651,"I got this movie at a flea market for about a couple of bucks.  Having grown up in the 60s, and that this was a story about an activist, my wife and I started watching it (she is a big Sissy Spacek fan).  She had me turn it off after a half-hour because she thought the story stupid.

I agreed, but watched the whole thing the next day just to see all of it.  The only reasonable thing about it was the acting, which was decent for a TV movie (which is why I gave it one star).  The story, the characters, everything else, was a cliche-ridden mess.  Every view espoused by the Spacek and Winkler characters says the same thing as today's supposedly ""open-minded liberals""; they haven't changed one bit in 40 years.

In typical Hollywood fashion, the writer couldn't even truthfully show the way in which the Katherine character was killed, as the real-life ""Katherine"", Diana Oughton, blew herself up while making bombs.  No, the writer had to show Katherine die while successfully committing an act of terrorism, somehow trying to make the end of her life have more meaning than it should have, considering this story is supposed to be based on true events.  Diana Oughton died in a stupid way doing stupid things, with the intent to commit murder.  There was nothing honorable in it.  And the only tragedy regarding the Katherine character is that she became more stupid as the film plodded on.

After watching it, the only tragic figures in this film are Katherine's parents.  That is where the real story should have been, not in the mindless stupidity of the main character.  After all, the parents have to suffer through the death of their child, and come to grips with it.  Even here, the writer uses cliches to show the parents explaining away their grief by indicating at the end that Katherine's intentions were good.  Garbage.  She may have started out with good intentions, but in the end she was nothing more than a hateful thug and a murderer.  What we really don't know is how Oughton's parents really dealt with her death, as that was never worked into ""Katherine"".  What is also sad is how the Katherine character returns to her parents' home for the last time, like the spoiled prodigal child who needs help.  Once she gets it (food and a bed), she is off to commit murder.

There isn't much in the way here of a good story.  The wrong characters are considered tragic; the ""based on true events"" lie is given the classic Hollywood treatment by taking artistic license with the truth; cliches abound, especially in the treatment of the parents and their dealing with the loss of their daughter.  All in all, a terrible film.  It makes sense that it would win an Emmy.",1201046400,5,2685,4.592436974789916
401645,4,6301972651,"This movie is constantly referred to as a fictionalized version of the story of Patty Hearst. Far from it. It is a fictionalized biopic of Diana Oughton, an early member/leader of the Weather Underground. It is pretty well made for a 70s TV movie, and, with the exception of the end, is fairly accurate. Many of the events depicted in the film are taken directly from Diana's life. It is well worth seeing for anyone interested in the Weathermen or simply the radical student movements of the 60s and 70s.",1186790400,30,505,4.622222222222222
401646,3,6301972651,"Sissy Spacek was already well on the road to a significant big screen career in 1975 when she opted to do this TV movie loosely based on the life of Weatherwoman Diana Oughton. Spacek has always shown a leaning toward socially conscious films, so it's no surprise that she was intrigued by the socio-political angle as well as the dramatic possibilities of this script (penned by Jeremy Paul Kagan, whose directorial and writing credits also show a socially conscious bent).

In 1975 you could still expect network television to at least OCCASIONALLY undertake a film like KATHERINE. The nation was still reeling from Vietnam, newly reeling from Watergate, and despite what TIME Magazine called ""the cooling of America,"" we were still trying to come to terms with the social and generational rifts that the 60s had wrought.

As a portrait of a revolutionary, KATHERINE is pretty much paint-by-numbers. Passionate, well meaning and socially conscious rich girl Katherine Alman gets caught up in the spirit of the times. At first she's a non-violent undergraduate activist, volunteering to teach inner city teens basic literacy. Upon graduation, she heads off to South America, despite her parents objections, and witnesses firsthand the oppressiveness of the oligarchical regimes there. Back in this country, she takes a job as an instructor at an alternative school in the Deep South, where she is further radicalized by the Fonz, I mean, Henry Winkler as a more radically inclined teacher there.

After leaving the school (forced out not only by the local pols, but also by their angry black colleagues who opt for a strict ""black pride"" curriculum for their young students), the two young activists become itinerant organizers, and eventually hook up with the Weather Underground. Katherine herself becomes increasingly strident, disavows her earlier non-violent stance and becomes increasingly alienated from her family and friends.

Utterly convinced of the rightness of her cause, she ultimately and tragically loses her life in its name. Like the real-life Oughton, she is blown up by her own bomb. Unlike Oughton, who died when a Greenwich Village bombmaking factory exploded killing almost all the Weathermen and -women in the building, Katherine is killed on a solitary mission to blow up some unnamed government target. That's cinematic license, and it works fairly well. Although it's not clear if the man plainly following her at the time is a government agent or one of her wealthy family's private detectives. Also not clear is if she actually winds up taking some innocent bystanders along with her--which would seem likely on a busy San Francisco street.

All of this could have been better developed. The film hits all the expected--and, in some sense necessary, notes--but like most TV movies, remains somewhat sketchy on the one hand and cliched on the other. I mean I could be wrong here, but it seems pretty ludicrous that every stick of dynamite used in the bomb that ultimately becomes Kathrine's, uh, undoing, is labeled ""DYNAMITE"" in big black lettering. OK, I haven't seen much dynamite up close, I admit, and maybe it is labeled nowadays (or even 30 years ago) for safety's sake, but the effect in the movie is still pretty absurd. At least in didn't say ""ACME"" as well.

The historical value of the film makes it worth watching. It would not be totally out of place on the syllabus of a history or poli-sci course today. In other words, it's a fairly good introduction to the history of the late 60s and early 70s. And it is well acted. Spacek's character is a ""hothead"" throughout, as one previous reviewer noted, but she has her tender moments too, particularly with her boyfriend and her family. Art Carney and Jane Wyatt are ideally cast as her wealthy parents. And Winkler is actually very good as Katherine's fairweatherman boyfriend. He appears to be a somewhat underrated actor.

Interestingly, the best scenes are the pseudo-documentary interviews with all the main characters. It is here that the characters seem to break away most distinctly from stereotypes and begin to reveal themselves in all their complexity. Odd in a way, since usually interviewees almost reflexively adopt a persona for the camera. Here, one suspects that it is only in these scenes that the characters get the chance (or perhaps, more accurately, feel compelled) to reflect on their actions and beliefs. It is only at the film's end that it becomes clear that Katherine herself is more apparition than interview subject. That makes her stridency--apparently even after death--all the more striking.",1114905600,,4613,5.085865257595772

7819052,4,6301972651,"RELEASED TO TV IN 1975 and written & directed by Jeremy Kagan, Katherine is a docudrama loosely based on Diana Oughton, who sprung from an affluent Illinois family and went off to university in the early 60s, but gave up graduate school to teach poor farm workers how to read & write in Guatemala for a couple of years in the mid-60s. Back at graduate school in the states in 1966, she eventually decided to work full time for the Children's Community School, an alternative means of education, where she met and fell in love with CCS teacher Bill Ayers. During these years she morphed from liberal to loony liberal radical, eventually joining the so-called Weather Underground. She died in 1970 at the premature age of 28 due to an accidental nail bomb explosion, which was intended for a dance of non-commissioned officers and their loved ones at Fort Dix, New Jersey.

Sissy Spacek effectively plays the fictitious title character (aka Oughton). She was 25 during filming and never looked better (speaking as someone who never thought she was particularly attractive, but she certainly has a nice figure). Sissy was a formidable rising star at the time after Badlands (1973), but she wouldnt truly break out until the year after Katherine with Carrie (1976). Henry Winkler plays the Ayers character while taking a break from Happy Days. Imagine The Fonz as a college liberal in the 60s and youll have a pretty good picture of his performance. Art Carney and Jane Wyatt are also on hand as Katherines parents.

When this movie debuted on television in October 75, Oughtons crest fall five years prior was still fairly fresh in the minds of North Americans; and the strange Patty Hearst saga of 1974-75 was only then winding down with Pattys arrest the previous month. The public was naturally wondering how intelligent young American women could give up wealthy socialite standing to embrace poverty and join nutty revolutionary groups. ""Katherine"" is a minor hidden gem that effectually shows how. The movie wisely takes the middle road between far left and far right. It helps us to sympathize with Katherines mindset while plainly showing that its a doomed path.

Forget its TV origins, this is a good realistic drama about life in America during the turbulent 60s & early 70s. The movie showcases the political and social craziness of those times and how it changed youths, for better or worse. It's akin to 1980s A Small Circle of Friends and 2000's underrated ""The 70s. The soundtrack features several hits from the 60s, but they're not the original songs by the original artists, obviously to save money and prevent licensing problems.

This movie is about Diana. She influenced me a lot. My politics were similar to hers except I am a pacifist. Her death and the way they identified her (from dental fragments) were heartbreaking. Her father never really recovered. He retreated from his friends and died very quietly, alone. In some ways, I hate that they made a movie about her. However, the casting was excellent. These are actors who understood that this was a tragedy for all of us.",1494374400,,614,4.491071428571429

7819056,4,6301972651,"This movie is not for everyone. Let me say that right off. I however, enjoyed the movie. It is done in documentary style and tells the story of a privileged girl who descends into a revolutionary for the American cause of truth, freedom etc of the 1960's. Many  of our youth's did join these groups, but did not descend as far as Katherine. The movie has Sissy Spacek in the lead role, with Art Carney as her father, Jane Wyman as her mother, and Henry Winkler as her boyfriend. Art Carney is out of character in this movie and pulls it off nicely. Watch for a very early Henry Winkler and a very different Henry Winkler. If you know him as the Fonz, you will see him in a completely different light in this movie. It's actually worth watching for his performance alone.

7819059,5,6301972651,"I couldn't really step back & be critical of the film in a technical way, my rating is as someone who lived and experienced this period of time. Frankly, I'm not sure I would have been interested otherwise. I wouldn't call it entertaining, but educating. It doesn't pretend to be anything else. I recall the woman of the film and the bombing incident. I remember the strikes in school. I remember thinking we could change the world. We did. It felt like the closest to social revolution and enlightenment in our history for a very long time. Each struggle for rights, compassion, social justice ultimately changes our world view just a little. Sometimes just enough. Injustice doesn't happen without permission and permission was being revoked in 1970. The Weathermen were the radical element that seems to be a part of every political attempt for change in our history. The fights for prohibition, unions etc. all had factions of that sort. It garnered attention but, for our social history, those groups never represent the majority. Looking at the film through a historical view, I thought it extremely well represented. It showed a progression of political thought that was not unrealistic for the subjects. It showed the very real conflict between the pull of parental approval and following idealistic teachings of ethics and justice. The eternal struggle of young adults trying to live their own lives, with their own visions but still needing support from the very people and institutions they object to. If I had any critique it would be that it was more restrained than reality, but considering the political majority in 1975, not surprising. Censors were still alive, well, and strong at the time. If I were watching this film without knowing or having a connection to the material I probably would have felt it slow, but realistically that was the natural pace of radicalization...especially to that degree.",1451865600,6,1919,5.018808777429467
