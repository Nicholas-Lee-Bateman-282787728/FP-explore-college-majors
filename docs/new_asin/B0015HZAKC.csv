8258702,4,B0015HZAKC,"Interesting departure from the novel.  No McQuaid (author McGahern's little twist at aimed at the former Archbishop of Dublin who was behind his firing as a school teacher) in the dramatization.  And the first scene was from another McGahern novel. The main actor did capture Moran quite well.
I could not help but compare Moran with the Denzel Washington character in Fences.  Both are so typical of many men and fathers in the 1950s and 1960s.  Both are examples of what George Lakoff describes as the stern father morality as opposed to the nurturing family morality.",1486339200,2,570,4.90625
8258703,3,B0015HZAKC,i was really disappointed in this story.  The actors brought the characters to life really well but overall the story was rather predictable.  I didn't like the character of the father who seemed to have few redeeming features.  He didn't deserve the loyalty of his family.  I felt as though I had seen family situations like this before and the story didn't shed a new light on how such problems might be solved. It was not a great series.,1444953600,,440,4.531645569620253

8258708,5,B0015HZAKC,This is a very interesting story of relationships between a father and his children and also between this same man and his wife. Tony Doyle's acting is superb. It is a serious drama and one that can be watched over and over.,1386288000,4,224,4.357142857142857

8258710,5,B0015HZAKC,Excellent drama. Shows what harboring hatered and bitterness can do to a person and their family. Recommend it to all lovers of Irish history.,1315180800,6,142,4.958333333333333
8258711,5,B0015HZAKC,"Beautiful Ireland is shown with a family of 5 children immediately after the mother dies in the early 1950's. The story of the dysfunction of this group is portrayed by a grand set of actors playing the family members.  Tony Doyle leads the group as the father who is disgusted with the Irish politics after spending time as a soldier in the IRA. He has a huge anger management problem, is selfish, brutal, and as the Irish have been known to put it--a horse's arse. He plays the role so convincingly that it's a wonder someone has not tossed his uncaring bulk over the Cliffs of Moor by now. That's how well he performs the role.  You'll love the actor but hate the character.

Daddy Moran remarries to Rose (Ger Ryan) who spends the rest of the decade making excuses for her husband if not calming him.  Similarly, daughter Maggie (Susan Lynch), who is the first of the 3 girls to escape the house, spends lots of time making up what people say about her father and making up what her father thinks of her siblings.  It is all an attempt to smooth hard feelings between all the members.  Mona (Gerandine O'Rawe) and Shella (Anne-Marie Duff) also find means of getting out from under the brutish treatment of an uncontrollable father. They escape the anxiety of never knowing when or what will next make Daddy angry.

Actually, son Luke (Brian F. O'Byrne)is the first to leave home, bitter as a result of his beatings from his father and vowing never to return. Will he ever, even as the father nears death in 1960, and the siblings beg him to make amends? The last to leave was son Michael (Demien McAdam) who has his own struggles learning to be adult, his alcohol limits, sexuality, and educational disinterests.

This ex-soldier/father of the 50's wants his family to be united and knows little of how to make it happen. The children fear him and want to escape but also have an inner craving for family life as well.  It is an emotional roller coaster for every member, each riding their own out-of-control coaster car, and the track has seemed to self destruct. This is a serious award winning BBC drama about Irish Baby Boomers (if there is such a thing). Powerful drama (no comedy) but 5-star worthy.

Will love win? Will the children return? Will there be forgiveness? Will the family unite? It is 4 episodes lasting about 55 minutes each, but don't expect to be able to stop between the segments. Hugely emotional, but tip-top Irish drama.

PS. No subtitles by the dialect is fairly understandable. We had to reverse a few times to catch some phrases.",1229644800,35,2562,4.608791208791208
