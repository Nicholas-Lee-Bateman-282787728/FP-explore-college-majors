8614249,5,B00FC1ZCAA,"Burn Notice is an awesome show. One of USA best dramas. I have been a fan from day one and was excited to get the first six seasons on DVD. Enjoy action, comraderie, treachery and lots of explosions! For the uninitiated a burn notice is when a government agent gets kicked to the curb. The show allowed viewers to see Michael Westin beat  the government at its own game. He was trained well and acted accordingly.",1418256000,,413,4.434210526315789

8614252,4,B00FC1ZCAA,"Had watched this series when it originally aired, and missed alot of episodes due to military obligations. Now I can watch the entire series in order at my leisure. The dvd presentation is nice without no hiccups on the display (up to season 5 now). Only issue I have with it it the menu system between the different seasons, After season three, the menu system was changed, and it took a few minutes to understand the new layout. Other than that. good product.",1397088000,,461,4.566265060240964
8614253,5,B00FC1ZCAA,"I love this show, sorry it's over.  The packages are perfect,  The DVD layout give you options of PLAY ALL or individually, each chapter on the individually selected option gives a summary, and language / setup options.  Totally satisfied, Season 7 and the Sam Ash DVD are separate,but worth it to complete the series.  As a former special forces soldier, I enjoyed re-visiting some of the devices shown here in these DVD""s.",1396310400,,424,4.847222222222222
8614254,5,B00FC1ZCAA,"When I was able to, I watched every episode. Now that I have the complete collection I can watch this show over and over again. Such great barbs between these actors. I especially loved watching Bruce Campbell. Totally enjoyed him in the Hercules series, now I can enjoy him in this one as well.",1393286400,,295,4.481481481481482

8614256,5,B00FC1ZCAA,"This collection IS NOT a different collection of episodes thrown together into a box.  What it IS is individual seasons of Burn Notice including original packaging and art work bundled together into one package.  Includes each seasons added features and extra's.
Love Burn Notice and also bought the seventh and final season plus the Movie Burn Notice the Fall of Sam Axe which introduces Sam's character and how he ended up in Miami and his connection with Michael Westen.",1390435200,,473,4.974683544303797
