4161693,5,B003O7I6KW,"Being the owner of the first two seasons, I just had to get Keeping Up With The Kardashians Season 3. It definitely delivered as expected! For the most part, even though the show is somewhat scripted, it still makes for good television and a lot of laughs. I am a big fan!",1316908800,3,272,4.25
4161694,5,B003O7I6KW,"I absolutely love this show. It's one of my favorites. Yes, it is stupid, but it's addicting.
The Kardashians are always on some funny or whacky adventure. I love when they fight because
it makes the show itense and make you wanna watch more of it! I first discovered Kim Kardashian
in the movie, Disaster Movie. And thought she was just hilarious for her stupidity, but she doesn't
seem that stupid in the show, she seems like a pretty good business woman. In the end, It's a great set
and it's highly recommended!",1302480000,8,515,4.548387096774194
4161695,5,B003O7I6KW,I just love keeping up with the Kardashians I can't wait for season four to come out and also I want to thank Amazon for their amazing service half of the times u can't hardly find some items and amazon has always came through for me keep up the good work Amazon I would recommend to anyone thank you for taking the time to ask me to write my review,1298937600,8,349,4.0

4161699,4,B003O7I6KW,"Yes, the show is a guilty pleasure.

Episodes that aired in 2009.  12 episodes this season

Now, THE IMPROVEMENTS.  1.  The episodes are wide screen, 2. Disc 1 has deleted scenes & 3. Disc 2 has commentary for episodes.  Why not with each episode-no clue about that.  But it is MUCH better than the blog from Rob on season 2.

Now, this time out apparently there are ONLY 3 Kardashians in this season.  Kourtney, Kim & Khloe are only shown on both sides of the DVD case.  BOTH discs have the same photo of them.  So, they do NOT give credit to Kris, Bruce, Rob, Kendall & Kylie?  Show is called ""Keeping Up With The Kardashians"" NOT ""Keeping Up With The Kardashian Sisters"".

1 big mistake done again on this DVD.  Same CHEAP, PLASTIC DVD CASE WITH THE INTENTIONAL HOLES IN IT.  CHEAP & NOT SAFE.  Apparently the DVD makers just want people to buy this over & over again since the DVD are NOT safely secure & 2.  It is NOT uncut  It is edited.

And, a point for anyone.  There was MASS CONFUSION ABOUT THE RELEASE DATE OF THIS DVD.  It was released 8-17-10.  Some stores & websites changed the date until 9-21-10.  THIS WAS UNTRUE.  I purchased the DVD from a local store 8-18-10.  So, make sure IF you want it check with the store.  DO NOT GO BY PRINTED MATERIAL",1282089600,9,1263,4.2905982905982905
4161700,4,B003O7I6KW,"I don't know what it is about these people but they entertain me. Granted it's not award winning TV over here, but it's just my guilty pleasure. There's always some kind of drama going on with this family and it's a good escape from every day life. Take it with a grain of salt though.

I haven't watched every episode of every season, but I have watched some of the most recent seasons in completion. It's kind of fun to go back to some of the early years and see how everyone really has changed! More-so Physically.

To each their own, but the Kardashians are definitely a required taste.",1461456000,,590,4.4036697247706424

4161725,5,B003O7I6KW,"After purchasing the first and second seasons, I loved them so much that I decided to purchase the third. For those looking for more of the same hilarious family chaos, they will not be disappointed. The girls start to argue more and more, as each of them becomes more and more famous. Youngest sibling Rob decides to break away from it entirely by moving in with his girlfriend, former Cheetah Girl Adrienne Bailon. Not even fame can tear the Kardashians apart, however, as love and family prevail once again. This is a must have for any Kardashian fan's collection.",1386547200,,567,4.737373737373737

4161731,5,B003O7I6KW,"i rated this show a 1 because it was as low as you could go...i think out of all the reality shows this one has to be the most faked,superficial crap ever.but it was a gift to my sister who loves it,she rates it a 5",1368662400,,215,3.6956521739130435

4161737,5,B003O7I6KW,Love this season of Kardashians! I have all the seasons. My favorite to watch on a boring rainy day! I received this season in the mail to watch while I was on break from school and was so excited to get it in the mail! thanks amazon!,1332720000,2,234,4.0
4161738,5,B003O7I6KW,"They really turned up the drama and excitement for the third season!! It starts out with a bang when the mother sacrifices a newnborn baby (given to her by the winner of the ""Let us drink your baby's blood in the name of our dark lords"" contest) in order to maintain another year of relevance in the public eye with HYSTERICAL results!!  However, it isn't all good times for this typical american family. Kim goes in for a routine checkup and discovers that she is actually mentally retarded. Very sad, but the fat sister running her fat mouth nearly ruins the touching speech from Jenner where he too admits to being retarded. The season ends with the Hiltons arriving for a party where they feast on the corpses of brown people. A must see!!!",1332288000,2,744,4.552238805970149
4161739,4,B003O7I6KW,"""Keeping Up with the Kardashians: Season 3"" follows the classic family sitcom formula of learning and hugging, and does it quite well. Each episode has a main story where at least one family member has a problem, but by the end they've learned an important lesson and get a hug. Each episode also has a lighter and humorous secondary story. The episodes are surprisingly well constructed and entertaining. The Kardashians are flawed but very likable, and adult sisters Kim and Kourtney are very sexy.
