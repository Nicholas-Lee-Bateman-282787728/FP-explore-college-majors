6453273,5,B00KX44QNK,"If you are a fan of Agatha Christie or David Suchet this documentary style program is a fascinating look at the life of this author.  In the first place it was positively fascinating to see Suchet slip so effortlessly in and out of character for Hercule Poirot.  He has become so entirely synonymous with that character that I almost expect him to actually be Poirot in real life.  The production company moves with a chronological progression through the life of Agatha Christie from her birth to her death by visiting locations where the most important events in her life took place.  It was wonderful to see the artifacts in the possession of her grandson, some poems written in her own hand while just four years old.  Then to be allowed to see one of the recently discovered notebooks Christie used when writing and plotting her novels was a rare treat also.  This woman had such an active imagination that she had these notebooks scattered all around her environment for making notes about books she was writing and yet she would flip over to the last pages and jot down notes concerning household accounts.

This was definitely worthwhile viewing to allow more insight into this woman who wrote about mysteries and even lived a mystery in her own life.  David Suchet is wonderful in his portrayal with sympathetic yet honest information about this woman whose work has made such a huge difference in his own career.",1415491200,4,1422,4.775510204081633
6453274,5,B00KX44QNK,"I have all dvds of Miss Marple and also Poirot by David Suchet. I guess you can say I am a Agatha Christie fan as I love her style of writing and the 2 characters she invented by doing so. Yes I have all DVDS of David Suchet as POIROT. He embodied POIROT. Miss Marple starring Geraldine Mc. Ewan and then the woman who took her place. I always want to know about the person who writes the Novels. I did so with Henry James a famous US author of the 19th Century. I read a book on his life. same with Jane Austen and the Bronte sisters. To love the books it is necessary for curiosity to understand the author.
If you enjoy Agatha Christie 's style buy this.",1414886400,2,657,4.061538461538461

6453276,3,B00KX44QNK,Too much gushing by Suchet and skippy information. Didn't Christie have any struggles writing her mysteries like other writers.  Did she just dash them off  from the top of der head.,1412985600,,182,4.838709677419355

6453278,5,B00KX44QNK,"I adore David Suchet, not only as Hercule Poirot but as himself.  He was and is the best Poirot ever.  His research into the little man with the egg-shaped head and the genius with which he played the role is unquestionably remarkable.  He is the perfect host for this film.

The film has so much information about Agatha Christie that I had not seen elsewhere.  I first read her books as a teenager in high school when I had read all of the Nancy Drew books over and over again.  A good friend of the family got me my first book, and it was love at first read.  I loved seeing Agatha Christie's grandson and her beautiful homes.  I really enjoyed this film and recommend it for anyone who loves Agatha Christie's books and want to get to know her.",1509235200,,748,4.292857142857143
6453279,5,B00KX44QNK,"If you already know about the life and loves of Agatha Christie then this presentation can fill in some of the holes. We get to follow Agathas life in chronological order with excerpts from her writings and visuals of the places that she had visited.

It was funny but David Suchet actually looked bored When they were showing Agathas home movies; he was actually antsy to get to the parts where she was writing her evil deeds.

They took a little extra time to describe the missing Agatha and not very much time showing her visits to places such as Ur (biblical, Ur of the Chaldees), ancient city of Mesopotamia.

All-in-all this is a do not miss documentary.",1509062400,,660,4.576271186440678
6453280,1,B00KX44QNK,"My review is based only on the first few minutes plus I can't stand Suchet. It opens not with the theme of the title but Suchet talking about himself. What a self-centered pompous actor! That tells me the director of the documentary is not a very good artist. I could be wrong, but I hated the opening theme enough not to continue. To enjoy Hercule Poirot in movies Peter Ustinov rocks the role. Really a shame because I love Agatha Christie works.",1508544000,,448,4.475609756097561
6453281,5,B00KX44QNK,"In 1976 my mother introduced me to the world of Agatha Christie. Her works have been such a constant pleasure in my life, no matter how many times I read one of her works. To watch the Poirot series, was to see Hercule come to life on screen as nearly imagined in my mind's eye, as I was reading the stories. This video expedition into both Mrs. Christie and Mr. Suchet is amazing.  In some ways it made me feel like I knew them both. My surprise in Mr. Suchet's actual voice versus his voice in character  drove home even more how amazing they are at their art.

What a remarkable person she was, I dare not spoil the surprise with specifics. But they all give insight to the wonderful lady and her character. If I could meet her and Mr. Suchet today all I could say would be 'Thank you'",1507766400,,788,4.2052980132450335
6453282,5,B00KX44QNK,Enjoyed this DVD very much.  I am a big fan of Agatha Christie and enjoyed knowing more about her life.  Always liked David Suchet too.,1504742400,,135,4.36

This is truly amazing and highly reccomended!",1482624000,,375,4.529411764705882
6453285,4,B00KX44QNK,"With an actor who played one of the author's characters this examines the life of the author. Shows and tells of her childhood. Married, husband to WW I, she is in nursing and learns about poisons which she goes on to use in her mystery crime writing.

Husband is unfaithful and eventually divorced, which leads her to travel and learn about distant lands which she uses in her writings. Important places in the author's life are visited. Insightful, interviews.",1472083200,,462,4.848101265822785

6453287,4,B00KX44QNK,Perhaps a bit too focused on David Suchet now and again but overall it is a fascinating look at Mrs/ Christie's life.  It's not a criticism of David Suchet; he is the personification of Poirot and he guided the observer nicely through the author's years.  Well done in fact.,1467158400,,274,4.571428571428571
6453288,5,B00KX44QNK,I loved the idea of David Suchet talking about the woman who made his career. I am so very sad that there will be no more Agatha Christie and David suchet.,1466985600,,155,4.032258064516129
6453289,5,B00KX44QNK,"What a well-done work about Agatha Christie!!  And having David Suchet as the one who leads us through the story of this remarkable lady was indeed an inspiring choice. Wonderfully interesting, and will- worth seeing.

6453294,5,B00KX44QNK,"This is a story about the beloved author herself.  It is told by David Suchet (aka, Hercules Poroit), Ms. Christie's family, and more.  Her life story is every bit as interesting as her books and even includes a mystery of several days when she was missing and would not tell the press where she had been!  Her life experiences led to her use of poisons as one of many ways to murder people.  Her nursing experience during WWII where she worked with many Belgian's being treated for war wounds is directly responsible for the development of Poroit.  Did you know that?  I didn't.  Many authors seem to have led very boring lives.  Not Ms. Christie.  I recommend this for anyone who loves her stories.  What, you say you haven't read her books?  Why not, they are marvelous!",1465171200,4,773,4.569343065693431

6453296,4,B00KX44QNK,"It was only right and fitting that actor David Suchet should be the one to take us on this journey to get to know a bit more about best selling author, Agatha Christie. Afterall, he has played one one of her seminal  characters, detective Hercules Poirot on film for about 25 years.

He meets with her grandson and other who have something to contribute to one's understanding of Ms. Christie. He also explores her early life, discusses her marriages, her writing and influences, as well as her mysterious disappearance in the 1920s that  for a time became shrouded in notoriety and remains much of a mystery till this day. It was remarkable how prolific she was, given that she raised a family and traveled all over the world with her second husband.

Those who are fans of Agatha  Christie will enjoy this lovely tribute to a woman who became one of the best selling and beloved authors of all time.",1464307200,,901,4.60625

Like others said, it didn't answer anything, just repeated what was always assumed about her disappearance, but left open a few other questions (what was the deal with the car?). And I thought she was a bit idolized here - she was soooo extraordinary.
I stopped watching about 3/4 through.  I tried to enjoy it, but unfortunately, I didn't",1461024000,2,410,4.942028985507246

6453318,5,B00KX44QNK,"I enjoyed this look at Agatha Christie's life very much. Poirot star, David Suchet, takes us on a journey to various locations in the UK and abroad associated with Christie's life and works of fiction.

Suchet visits with Christie's grandson, Matthew Prichard at Greenway (the family country estate) in Devon, where he is treated to a look at family photos, home movies, and Christie's journals and manuscripts. Suchet also discusses Christie's life, both personal and professional, with her biographers and a historian knowledgeable about Christie's mysterious 1926 disappearance.

High quality filming and editing of beautiful locations and intelligent, respectful conversations about the woman said to be the best-selling novelist of all time make for a top notch documentary. Highly recommended.",1455667200,,799,5.65

It's obvious from her writing as early as 4 years old she was a child prodigy.  Authors at the peaks of their careers should wish they could write as well as some of the things she wrote before she turned ten.  It's a shame her private life was plagued with personal hardship and sadness, but that seems to be the norm for a lot of geniuses.

He kept saying how smart he was but there was no evidence of it. David S did not say that but I observed a similar disappointment.

QUESTION: Who wrote this poem?

""There was once a little cowslip,
And a pretty flower, too,
But yet she cried and fretted,
All for a robe of blue,
Now a merry little fairy
Who loved a trick too play
Just changed into a nightshade
That flower without delay,
The silly little nightshade
Thought her life a dream of bliss
Yet she wondered why the butterfly
Came not to give his kiss.""

ANSWER: Agatha Christie (nee Miller), age 10.

Yes, the subject of this extraordinary documentary is the ""Queen of Crime"" herself, Agatha Christie.

It is Hercule Poirot himself that guides us in unravelling Christie's life.  Well, not quite.  Actually, it is the actor who magnificently portrayed the Belgian detective, one of Christie's greatest literary creations, who guides us on our journey.  And that actor is David Suchet (pronounced ""Sue-shay"").

In Suchet's own words:

""Hercule Poirot.  I know this man.  Agatha Christie's famous creation.  I know him so well, I could take him shopping.  But how well do I, David Suchet, know Poirot's creator?""

Suchet, just like his alter ego, does some great detective work.  Some highlights of this documentary include seeing Christie's home movies, her early works (such as the poem reproduced above), talking with her biographer, hearing Christie's actual voice, seeing black and white photos, talking with historians, and viewing old newspaper articles concerning Christie.

Finally, there is one glaring error made.  Suchet tells us that Christie was born in 1819.  No.  She was born in 1890.

In conclusion, this documentary is a treat for Agatha Christie fans.  David Suchet explores the close links between Christie's fascinating life & her work and discovers just what it is about this woman that allowed her to become the bestselling murder mystery writer in history!!

6453483,5,B00KX44QNK,"In this delightful film, actor David Suchet (who plays Poirot) takes us around to all of Agatha Christie's favorite haunts and homes to solve the mystery of her. Each person is a puzzle.  Why did they do the things they did?  What was the key to their success?  This film attempts to answer the questions revolving around Christie and her particular genius.  First, we meet Christie's grandson at Greenway, her home in Devon.  We see home movies and the earliest photo of her when she was five holding her dog who was named George Washington, interestingly enough.

As this film notes, we think of Christie as the quintessential Englishwoman, but her father was born in New York.  We meet several of her biographers and learn about her marriages and war work. We travel to Dartmoor where she wrote her first book in 1916  titled THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES which introduced the little Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot.

After writing about 12 books, she created the character of Miss Marple in 1962, who was based upon her grandmother. I wasn't aware of that fact or others about Ms. Christie's life.  You meet the illustrator of over 100 of the paperback covers of Christie's work.  Then there's the mysterious notebooks, 73 of them, found in a box in her home in 2005 which have jottings of characters and plots.

If you read Christie's autobiography, which I thoroughly enjoyed, you will sense she was a warm, humble, kindly and grateful person which this film captures.  Any Christie fan should love to see her world as illumined in this sympathetic portrayal.  It's fun to see David Suchet walk normally, not mincing around as pompous, but lovable, Poirot.  He's a charming narrator for this film.",1417132800,12,1707,4.837931034482758

For the last 25 years British actor David Suchet has been playing the character of Hercule Poirot  the Belgian detective created by Agatha Christie  on television. So PBS felt that he was the perfect person to tell the story of the writer.
During the 55 minutes Suchet (without the Poirot mustache) visits Christies biographer, but more importantly, he pays visit to Christies grandson at the Christie edtate in Devon, England where the grandson shows family photos and home movies that have never been allowed to be seen before. He is also given an copy of Christies autobiography with corrections noted by her  and, later, he is shown a series of notebooks where Christioe would  write her ideas.

Some of the production is a bit too overdone  for my tastes  as Suchet goes to the part of Devon where Christie went missing and does it in a car of similar vintage to Christies.  And there more time spent on Poirot than her other detective, Miss Marple.

But, there is a wealth of new info here and I think any true Christie fan will want to see this.

The DVD has no bonus features.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

It was nice to get this more personal look into the woman and her life and how she came to write so many wonderful books.  I would recommend this Christie DVD to anyone who enjoys her works.",1415577600,8,299,4.228070175438597
8662434,5,B00KX44QNK,"I enjoyed the mysteries that Agatha Christie wrote - I read them all - and I enjoy the acting of David Suchet, the narrator of this film, even when he plays character other than Poirot, even when he is the villain in the film. So, I enjoyed this film. It contains lots of information about Christie, from her own writings, her descendant, and her biographers. There is much information in the hour of the film. We find out that she trained as a pharmacy assistant and learnt all about the poisons that are in many of her novels. Her husband was apparently mentally damaged during World War I, had an affair with a woman, wanted and got a divorce in 1928 that Agatha did not want to give him, and after the divorce she disappeared for some time. This disappearance remains a mystery until today. After the divorce Agatha began a new phase of her life, including writing books under a pseudonym for a while.",1531699200,,905,4.490909090909091

8662437,4,B00KX44QNK,"I watched an episode or two of Suchet's Poirot and couldn't stand it or him. This documentary, however, I enjoyed very much because although he narrates it and does say things about himself it is VERY much about Mrs. Christie, an author whose works I've enjoyed for well over forty years. So, if you don't like Suchet pretend like it's not him (it isn't awfully hard to do since he doesn't have the mustache).",1522195200,,409,4.54054054054054

8662440,3,B00KX44QNK,"You are not going to learn anything that makes you gasp in this biography.  The facts about her life are pretty normal, and not overly interesting in general- she was very smart, she loved the water...you see where I'm going with this.  Even the big ""mystery"", when she disappears has a bland resolution.  I watched the whole thing, but was not riveted",1513814400,3,352,4.645161290322581

This is beautiful, intimate, lovely, interesting AND I have fallen in love with Suchet. The little things he says, the little things he does that are not scripted. So sweet, so cute. This is a gem of a show, just like Agatha Christie is a gem.",1511395200,2,392,4.103896103896104

With David Suchet guiding the program through the various stages of her life, the viewer gets to see what her life was like, the good and the bad. As an artist myself, I really enjoyed the segment on the artist who painted many of her covers. If you enjoy historic imagery you will enjoy this.",1510099200,2,388,4.47887323943662
