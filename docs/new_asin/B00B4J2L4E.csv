5555112,4,B00B4J2L4E,"""Kill Your Darlings"" (2013 release; 104 min.) is not to be confused with the completely unrelated film of the same name from 2006 starring Alexander Skargard. The 2013 film brings the story of how the Beat generation got its not-so-humble start, when in the mid-1940s Allen Ginsberg (played by Daniel Radcliffe), then a freshman at Columbia University, gets to know and befriend Jack Kerouac (played by Jack Huston) as well as William S. Burroughs (played by Ben Foster). The movie actually felt like two-movies-in-one. The first part of the movie shows us how these three, along with a few more characters, start dreaming up what would eventually be known as the Beat generation. The basic formula of that seemed to have been: cause as much havoc as possible (at one point one of them concludes: ""we have a duty to break the law!"", as if that makes it okay), go to lots of night clubs in Harlem to check out the latest jazz combo, and smoke lots and lots of cigarettes (and take in a few not-quite-so-legal things as well). The second part of the movie centers around the troubled relationship between Lucien Carr (played by Dane DeHaan) and David Kammerer (played by Michael C. Hall) on the one hand, and Ginsberg's own relationship with Carr on the other hand. To tell you much more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: as between the 2-in-1 films, I was not particularly drawn in with the first part of the movie, as it all felt very forced (I kept thinking: look at them trying hard to act drunk when they really aren't!). But it is the second part of the film that really pulled me in and caught my attention (and then kept it through the end). The events portrayed in the film are based on true events, so perhaps you know what is going to happen. If you don't, no worries, I'm not going to spoil anything. Just be ready to be surprised, more than once even. The acting performances are quite good, in particular Dane DeHaan, but check out also a couple of small roles from Elizabeth Olsen as Kerouac's girlfriend Edie, hard to believe that she is still only 24, I can't wait to see more of her; and also Jennifer Jason Leigh as Allen Ginsberg's unstable mom. When watching this, you can't help but think back to that other Beat generation movie from last year, ""On The Road"" (based on the Kerouac book). In the end, they are very different movies, and both worth checking out. Make sure you don't walk out of the theatre or turn off the DVD as soon as the end credits start rolling. Not only do we get to hear the Libertines' ""Don't Look back Into the Sun"" as the credits roll, but even better is that we get to see actual photos from the early days of the Beat generation.

This movie debuted to nice critical acclaim at the 2013 Sundance film festival, and I have been looking forward to seeing it. It finally opened at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati in November '13. The screening I saw this at was not particularly well attended, and even with the great critical buzz, it was clear this would not be sticking around in the theatres very long. Regardless, if you have a chance to check it out, be it in the theatres or on DVD/Blu-ray, go for it!",1389744000,27,3250,4.49746192893401

DeHaan especially does a phenomenal job with his performance, as well as Michael C. Hall. Soundtrack is lovely, the story is written well, and the actors are all what make this so successful!

However, the youth of America might find it a bit tedious, unless they have studied this movement.  Its constructed pretty well, but the story may not be of interest to everyone.

The only issues i had with it were that it sort of dealt with homosexuality in a cartoonish and condescending way and the use of modern music starting in like, the third reel absolutely took me out of the world of the movie.  It made no sense.  I like that TV on The Radio song, but damn,  just because the music director liked a song, doesn't mean it should just get slapped into a movie set 60 years ago!",1485648000,3,495,4.268817204301075

Daniel shape a shy and a little bit coward young man at the beginning part of the movie, at the middle part, he feel wonderful to join some activities, and when his friend killed his partner at the end, his inside world became complex. The changes has been played by him, he is became a great actor.

5555128,5,B00B4J2L4E,"Solid, greatly symbolic movie with phenomenal, realistic actors that really take their roles seriously. I think, to summarize the whole movie, a quote from Dane Dehaan, who plays Lucien: ""This is a story that not many have heard but everyone should know about."" It's a thorough story and gives people a deeper insight into the Beat writer's, pre-Beat writer era. Nonetheless, I cringe any time they describe Lucien and David's relationship more so as an ""unrequited love"", rather than a pedophile stalking a minor. Yes, this story is more leaning toward Allen Ginsberg's point-of-view, so certain characteristics of Lucien may have been altered, but mainly that's because Allen's diaries and journals gave more specifics and research-material than anything Lucien left behind. Overall ,this is a great movie and I am very glad to see it receive all the recognition it truly deserves.",1477008000,,883,5.225352112676056

5555134,3,B00B4J2L4E,"Ginsberg is one of my heroes and Radcliffe doesn't offend me in this role. Besides his quite good American accent, vulnerable affect and intelligent duffiness, very little stands out about this film. It's -- um -- solid: The narrative is coherent, the performances appropriate and the central themes professionally explored. I'm afraid that's about it. The film didn't give me much of a sense of the time period (I was REALLY hoping for that) and it kept the subject of sex preference quite broad and caricatured. It labors over the attraction between Ginsy and Carr but never makes it feel genuine. When I watch it again, I'll be focusing on Radcliffe.",1472860800,2,653,4.891891891891892

Although I was out at 18 in 1969, and I remember mot of the things gay people got arrested for, I was not aware that about 20 years earlier, NYC had a law on its books that made the killing of a homosexual who made a pass at you---providing you were heterosexual---was not murder! Murder was legal for a simple pass if you lied about the extent of the pass.
Many of these horrors are in this movie. I knew about the pre-1969 lobotomies in California;but MURDER in NYC?
For many gay people, this film will be disturbing. It is not the OUT 100 in this decade! It is the amazingly strong homosexuals over 60 years ago.",1461283200,2,642,4.270491803278689

5555150,3,B00B4J2L4E,"Honestly, I felt like this movie was unrefined. It was trying to be profound, but just came off as disorganized and underdeveloped. They didn't compel me to feel sympathy for any of the people. I feel like the only reason this movie was made is because someone thought that ""historical figure"" + ""LGBT"" + ""tragedy"" = ""deep"". I understand options are limited when you're doing a biopic about real people, but I almost wish they could have found a way to make this movie uplifting or inspiring regardless, or just choose a different chapter from history altogether if that wasn't possible. Being part of the LGBT community myself, I just feel that this movie essentially already exists in one form or another, and just once I would like to see something with a refreshing take on the ""tragic gay visionary"" story, rather than the typical negative fare. I'm not saying that it's a terrible movie and I'm sure that it appeals to some, but it's not as deep as it would like to be. I will say that Daniel Radcliffe is excellent and he made this at least worth the rental. Still, that doesn't change the fact that I am weary of seemingly every mainstream LGBT movie not only ending in negativity and tragedy, but wanting for real inspiration - this movie is no exception.
The difference between this and something like the Imitation Game (for all its many faults) is that the Imitation Game, though also somewhat tragic, at least generates sympathy for its protagonist by showing him struggling in order accomplish a profound goal. With Kill Your Darlings,  the protagonist is struggling against....something....to accomplish...something else....But it's just not clear what the ""somethings"" really are. The struggle is vague, the narrative uninspired. But give it a rent and see what you think I guess.",1455667200,,1796,4.888524590163934

5555162,3,B00B4J2L4E,"Very adult theme.  Not to be watched with little kids.

The story is centered around Allen Ginsberg, a college student whom wants to be a poet/writer.  He meets a group of boys, and he is never the same again.  He goes from straight-laced, to experimenting drugs, taking up the habit of smoking, drinking, and intimate encounters.  A friend of his has a deep, dark secret, and I won't tell because you will have to watch the film.

It is fascinating to hear Daniel Radcliffe without his native accent.  He does a great job acting as an American.  Unlike in ""Horns"", where there's a scene his accent threatened to come out, if you never heard of Daniel Radcliffe before, or seen any of the ""Harry Potter"" movies, you would think he was born on ""this side of the pond.""",1445472000,,767,4.507246376811594

Maybe this film's director used all the ""intrigue"" building up to the murder, and THEN  thought guessing who did it would be fun. But if Lou was not so depressed, and dragging poor little Harry Potter around to pitch black places he should NEVER, be, we could have had a coherent story............or one that was visible to the naked eye.

Then the sex scene with Potter, (Radcliffe) was just SUCH an attempt to be brave, in a grown up movie, it just looked like Kiddie Porn with that tiny, albeit rather wooly body.

My main problem with the film was that the characters were not fully developed and the background of the relationship between Lucien Carr and David Kammerer was too sketchy to develop any real feelings for them.

5555202,2,B00B4J2L4E,"William Burroughs is the most boring person who ever lived. Lucien Carr and Jack Kerouac are close behind. Allen Ginsberg is interesting for two reasons.

First, he was a surprisingly ordinary, unremarkable, and unpretentious person, as open and honest and honorable as he knew how to be; not a great poet or a great anything else, but great at being himself. Second, Daniel Radcliffe plays him in this movie. Radcliffe is amazing.

I was never a Potter fan, but I saw some of the movies. Radcliffe made no impression on me at all. But he's made some interesting choices since that ended, and I wanted to see what he's like outside of that tedious Potter world. So Radcliffe is the reason I watched this, but I immediately forgot who he was. He thoroughly and convincingly becomes the Ginsberg character in this movie, and he makes that character far more interesting and complex than the real Ginsberg was.

Every second he's on screen is marvelous because of him and only because of him. Nothing else about this movie is worth watching. Performers I've liked previously (Foster, Hall, DeHaan) are flat and dumb here. Only Jennifer Jason Leigh and David Cross, as Ginsberg's parents, are halfway believable and seem almost like real people. All the rest are just annoying posers.

For this story to work (I could care less that it's true) Carr MUST be a charismatic character, and he's not charismatic at all in this movie. He's just a jerk. And he's ugly. That anybody would have looked at him twice or paid attention to a word he said is completely unbelievable - except Burroughs, who was a spoiled, self-obsessed moron and even more obnoxious than Carr himself.

So I love Allen Ginsberg because he was so extraordinarily ordinary; and I love Daniel Radcliffe as Ginsberg in this movie, but that's all I love about it.",1419724800,,1823,4.7746031746031745

5555216,5,B00B4J2L4E,"I read the factual background of this movie. It seems that David Kammerer, a pedophilic predator, groomed Lucien Carr as his boy lover. That seems like the ancient Greek practice of the older man, the erasthes, courting his teen youngster, the eromenos. But this movie was in 20th century America, not ancient Greece. Carr was only 12 years old and Kammerer his 26 year old Boy Scout leader! Carr's father had left him and his mother when he was a baby and Kammerer exploited the boy's need for a loving, caring father. Kammerer was a creep and shameless hunter of the boy; he actually moved 4 times to be near Carr, even though Lucien's mother had her son change schools to elude his stalker. The supreme irony of Kammerer's end was not revealed in the movie, for Lucien repeatedly stabbed Kammerer with not just any knife, but with his Official Boy Scouts Knife!",1414540800,,864,4.65359477124183
5555217,2,B00B4J2L4E,"Like many I was attracted to this story because of an interest in the big beat authors - Keroauc, Ginsberg, and Burroughs - and after doing some research on Lucien Carr I find this film to be very inaccurate and void of ethical considersation. To start Ill discuss the few highlights I found in this ugly piece of film making. Daniel Radcliffe, Ben Foster, and Dane DeHann acted their roles fairly well, I especially enjoyed Fosters portrayal of Burroughs. The film makers did a great job at finding actors who resembled their roles. With the exception of Daniel Radcliffe I think they all look their parts well, in particular Dane DeHann. That said Ill discuss my issues with this movie. What I find particulary appallling is how John Krokidas could write a screenplay that makes a pedophile seem like a victim and sympathetic. Look into Carr's story and you'll find David Kammerer was nothing more than a sickening pedophile. Kammerer met Carr when he was the troop leader of Carr's boy scout group when Carr was 12. That should in itself say a lot to you. Carr whose father had abandoned him and his mother looked to Kammerer as a surrogate father type and was confused about some of the things Kammerer would do with him. Initially Carr's mother allowed Kammerer to take him on vacations where Kammerer would tell strangers that he was in fact Carr's father. Again strike you as standard pedophile behavior? Carr's mother eventually began to move around the country with her son and Kammerer would pop up anywhere they went. When Carr killed Kammerer he used his boy scout knife which does not seem coincidental but rather an expression of pent up rage at this leacherous man who forced cruel acts upon him as a child. Ive seen interviews with DeHann and Radcliffe where they say they did a lot of research into their characters to prepare for their roles and I have to wonder did they not see this story for what it is? I find it despicable that they continued with this movie after having done research on this event and then acting in a movie that makes Carr the villian and Kammerer the victim. I understand Hollywood revises some things for the sake of crossing something into film but something of this magnitude is inexcusable. Even within the movie this story makes no sense. In the film Ginsberg refuses to defend Carr in court because Kammerer had saved Carr's life in an attempted suicide attempt. Does it ever occur to you that Carr attempted suicide because of Kammerers unrelenting pursual and abuse? Carr even makes mention of it in the film so whether you know the real history or not this makes no sense. The movie trys to depict Carr as a closeted homosexual who kills Kammerer out of denial meanwhile its clear Kammerer is disturbed (Keroaucs Cat is a good example) and that Carr was abused. That is the most unconvincing love story Ive ever seen. And Kammerer's death scene is ridiculous. Walking into Carr's knife and allowing him to repeatedly stab him? Even with him being disturbed I cant see that happening.
I rate this two stars mainly for the acting of the aforementioned actors, on a whole this movie was poorly written and revoltingly revised. I suggest looking up Lucien Carr's son Caleb Carr's review of KYD if you want to know more of the actual events.
I understand a lot of viewers will mainly be watching this to see ""Harry Potter butt sex"" but I hope that if this movie is able to do any good that it encourages you to look into these people. Keroauc, Ginsberg, and Burroughs, were incredible writers who produced some of the best literary contributions of the 20th century. Use this movie as a stepping stone to some great writers, then forget it and move on.",1413936000,,3700,4.667687595712098

5555220,4,B00B4J2L4E,"The most intriguing movie since Brokeback Mountain.  The most thrilling movie since Purple Noon / The talented Mr Ripley.  Very complex, dynamic, transient, mysterious and haunting movie.  I knew nothing about the movie's content when borrowed from the library.  The title was captivating as it foreshadows a murder plot.  Based on a true story, no wonder the details of the events seemed so real and original.  The script was well written except for the part where Allen's mother mental illness surfaced, which seemed a bit overstretched, slightly fake.  I'd re-write those few scenes.  Just visit any mental institution and you'll see why.

The cast was very well chosen, not only they look like the real life characters they play, but also in good acting.  The movie also did well in the costume department, and the feel of the period era.  I can feel being transported to a different time, a different place, like an adventure, to the 1940s, yet still feel like it was ""modern""  as if at that period, the things they did was ""hip""  And I feel like in a time capsule, feel what they feel at the age that they were, and in a time they were in.  We, the audience, long for that adventure with full energy of youth, the time hanging out with the cool kids in school, the bad boys, the versatile classmate that can take us out of our ordinary boring life to a new heighten experience.  We long for that small circle of friends we share common interests and bonding, a gift few possess, to both uplift our happiness and to ease the pain in everyday life challenges.

The movie was interesting, slow at the beginning, then suddenly it took off.  The extra feature interview with writer and director was interesting to see.  Seeing the work these two men labored to get this movie in production makes you want to shake hands with the writer and give the director a big hug.  An inspiration to unknown aspiring writers, movie makers out there.  Even if the title of the movie had been ""The Night in Question""  I'd still pull it out of the movie shelve.  This movie certainly deviates Daniel Radcliffe from his infantile role of Harry Potter, and launches him into a more complex, dynamic role that proves he is an able actor with great versatility.  This movie will definitely become an instant classic",1412640000,,2297,4.659203980099503

Definitely not for the Harry Potter fans; there are a few scenes where Radcliffe (Allen Ginsberg) engages in full-blown gay sex.

If you're a novice with an open mind about things Ginsberg, Burroughs, and Kerouac, you'll most likely really go this film.

5555225,4,B00B4J2L4E,"The Beat Generation is one of those post-World War II literary movements that was almost singularly influential in what they were doing with prose and poetry that they changed things forever. Amongst the most famous of this movement were the unholy trinity of Jack Kerouac, William Burroughs, and Allen Ginsburg. But there were some that helped this movement along that are largely forgotten, and director John Krokidas' KILL YOUR DARLINGS presents part of that story.

This film is not only about the beginnings of the Beat Generation, but of the bohemian lifestyles of those involved and the ensuing chaos that enveloped them all. Allen Ginsburg (Daniel Radcliffe) is a young student at Columbia University with a moderately famous poet father (played by David Cross) who he has problems with, and a paranoid schizophrenic mother (played by Jennifer Jason Leigh) who he tries to care for. He is almost immediately drawn to Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan), a young genius with a chip on his shoulder. He rails against authority, and particularly an artistic authority. Through Carr, Ginsburg meets Kerouac (Jack Huston) as well as Burroughs (Ben Foster). Ginsburg goes throughout most of the film trying to hide his homosexuality since at that time in American history, it was not only criminal activity, it was also considered a mental illness. Enter a sort of fifth wheel to this group of ne'er-do-wells, David Kammerer (Michael C. Hall), an older man obsessed with Lucien. He is tragically in love with Lucien, but Lucien looks to rid himself of this unwanted affection. When he does, everyone finds themselves involved in a crime of passion that doesn't bode well for anyone.

One of the things that pleased me the most about this film was that it doesn't paint anyone as a clear hero or a clear villain. Carr and Kammerer are cruel at times, but neither one of them are evil. One of the things that continues to disappoint me, though, is Dane DeHaan's consistent casting as a troubled young man. I've seen nearly all of the films he's been in but he seems to keep getting cast as this same character. Despite the fact that he's consistently pretty great, I don't want DeHaan to become another Anthony Perkins thanks to his breakout performance in CHRONICLE. That aside, it's a real joy to see Daniel Radcliffe being taken seriously and taking his career seriously. He's not just trying to cash in on his HARRY POTTER fame; he's taking a lot of increasingly challenging roles and making them shine. As far as the supporting performances, the real standout is Jennifer Jason Leigh as Ginsburg's mother. She does so much with a limited amount of screen time. Also worth noting is Foster as Burroughs. He's such an instinctual performer with an uncanny ability to slip into a role, and deserves to be a much bigger presence in this industry. I was a little saddened to see the great Elizabeth Olsen in such a small role as Kerouac's not-quite-wife, but she always adds a good lift to any role, regardless of how thankless it might be.

Krokidas does some really nice stuff visually in this film, and does a lot to make the whole experience extremely immersive. There are some film-school cliches (such as the cross-cut between sex and death, which has really gotten old), but overall, he does a really excellent job. He also trims a lot of fat off the story, making it a much leaner film without sacrificing character.

KILL YOUR DARLINGS thankfully doesn't try to delve too deeply into the literary work of these legendary writers, but rather succeeds by telling a story about their beginnings and an experience that, for better or worse, helped to form them.",1411516800,,3656,4.863563402889246

I did not know what to expect from this film (being unfamiliar with most of the principal characters, and the incident that both brought them together and tore them apart while at Columbia) but it blew me away!  The 1940s setting and atmosphere draw the viewer in and will not let go, and the acting from all involved, is, in a word, brilliant.

Daniel Radcliffe portrays the poet Allen Ginsberg during his freshman year at Columbia.  A chance meeting with classmate Lucien Carr brings introductions to William Burroughs, Jack Kerouac, and others who will lead the Beat Generation.  It also brings a shocking involvement in a (seemingly un-premeditated) murder...but the question of motivation, ""honor killing,"" and exactly who was controlling whom will haunt the viewer long after the final credits roll.

It is mesmerizing to see Radcliffe take risks, push the limits, and grow as an actor.  He is definitely not just Harry Potter anymore!  The chemistry between him and actor Dane DeHaan, (who portrays Mr. Carr) becomes stronger and more intense with each scene, and causes the viewer to feel as if he or she is not simply watching, but...actually there.

As other reviewers have mentioned, please watch to the very end, to see photographs of all the real persons, learn what happened after the event in question, how it lead (albeit indirectly) to the writing of On the Road.

The film is dark, and very R-rated, so may not be for everyone.  Admittedly, I did not think it was for me, but am now enriched by having watched.  Please...do yourself a favor, take a chance, and do the same.  It is so worth seeking out, and even watching more than once.

Somethings are not for everyone, but I can still appreciate the terrific performances and unique storyline of Kill Your Darlings. This film follows the early lives, and some previously untold stories, of the 1940's Beat Generation. People like Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, & William S. Burroughs are featured prominently in this film, and show what some of America's greatest writers were like when they were mere college students. The story centers mainly around Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan),  who was better than any of them, and could have also been one of the greats, if it wasn't for an event that changed his life forever. The story is a gripping drama, telling a true, untold story from the 1940's, so what's not to like? There was a lot of focus on Philosophy, Art, Poetry and Love. There are some people that really that stuff up, but it just really wasn't for me. DeHaan and Daniel Radcliffe were both terrific, but I'll always have a problem seeing Radcliffe playing anyone except for Harry Potter, and when Radcliffe was in a rather graphic sex scene, I admit I had to avert my eyes. The bottom line is that Kill Your Darlings isn't a bad film, but it's very philosophic and somewhat slow moving.

5555262,5,B00B4J2L4E,"I'm not certain that the real life story this film is based on is well known. I was doing some research on the Beat poets/writers when I was in grad school and came across an isolated story about a man named Lucjen Carr killing one David Kammerer. Carr used as his defense the claim that Kammerer had been sexually pursuing him. In the end Carr got a slap on the hand, a lot of sympathy, and a short stint in jail. He went on to become a wire service editor of some reknown and found the time to father the brilliant writer Caleb Carr. The probably most interesting aspect to this story was the homosexual ramifications of the case.
This film is based on the experiences of writer/poet Allen Ginsburg and his meeting Carr while both were students at Columbia University. While it does not center exclusively on the crime itself, it blends the story of the growing friendship of Carr and Ginsberg and the other Beat writers who came together at the time and Kammerer's growing obsession with Carr.
I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I popped this into my DVR, but it became rapidly apparent why this film didn't appear in a lot of theaters near my home. It was cerebral in a way that is not exactly main stream and would no doubt anger some people despite the fact that the principles all portrayed in the movie are dead.
Despite the film's darkness and moodiness, I really liked it and found it fascinating. The performances were top notch and the characterizations were well defined and thought out.
As for Ginsberg, I met him at a symposium once celebrating the poet William Blake. He was a fascinating older gay man with a ton of charisma and didn't seem dark or suicidal.

The movie covers only a short period of time in the lives of the Beat writers, and includes the pivotal event which helped to shape their future and provide a significant foundation for their future literary work.

Kill Your Darlings begins with Allen Ginsberg (played by Daniel Radcliffe) enrolling at Columbia University and meeting Lucien Carr (played by Dane DeHaan). Lucien Carr then introduces Ginsberg to David Kammerer (played by Michael C Hall), William S Burroughs (played by Ben Foster) and Jack Kerouac (played by Jack Huston). The phrase ""Kill Your Darlings"" is a quote from Faulkner and refers to the need to not get too attached to one's written words. The quote is cited by the professor in one of the first writing classes attended by Ginsberg. Ginsberg asks a question during the class and is instantly put down by the professor; the students are to listen and do what they're told, as the alternative is to quit school and go to war (it's the middle of WWII).

During the first part of the film, we see the young men getting to know each other at parties and long alcohol and drug-infused sessions where they decry the status quo, criticize their professors and the establishment and try to articulate a ""new vision"". Some of the scenes of debauchery are manic and wild, particularly the one where they slash through the pages of books, tear out pages and nail them to the wall. There is an unspoken hint of homosexuality between several of the men, but particularly the stalking of Lucien by Kammerer. These two appear to be co-dependent and oddly connected, which causes Ginsberg to be quite jealous. Lucien is the blonde-haired, blue-eyed charismatic center of the group and he always gets his way.

The actors are all very convincing in their roles, but I still can't help but see Harry Potter in Daniel Radcliffe. Perhaps as he ages and looks less like the adolescent, Harry will fade away... He has become a skilled dramatic actor, but some of facial ticks are a bit distracting.",1400976000,,2255,4.7621483375959075

Lingers and perhaps stretches facts a bit in regard to some juvenile hijinks at Columbia but can't miss with the raw elements this true story is based upon - the awkwardness of trying to fit in and find your way as a youth on your own, the joy of establishing first, great friendships and...a murder!  Highly recommended.",1400630400,3,697,5.1415929203539825
5555272,1,B00B4J2L4E,"I've never been a big fan of movies that are too wrapped up in their ""artistic integrity"" to be entertaining. There are certain subjects that film makers, writers and other artists have as deeply held convictions on as the most religious zealot to stand on a pulpit proclaiming his faith. The difference is that most of these artistic zealots believe in their art above all else and hold the men who influence them as sacred. It's the same reason we yearly have millionaires awarding other millionaires awards on TV.

The case in point this time around is the author Allen Ginsberg, a poet that many have proclaimed to be the voice of his generation, a generation known at the beat generation. I'm sorry but if you have to call yourself part of a group while saying people shouldn't be part of a group, you're pretentious. Ginsberg was a member of that same group of people that included both Jack Kerouac and William Burroughs. All are involved in the release of KILL YOUR DARLINGS.

This true story begins with Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliff) heading off to college where his world completely changes. On a tour of the library for freshmen he is witness to an outburst by bad boy Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan). In class he immediately starts off by disagreeing with his professor about the dynamics of how poetry should be written which catches the eye of Carr. Soon Ginsberg is recruited into the world of Carr.

Rather than follow along with the standard things people do in college like sporting events, lectures or pep rallies (the film takes place in the 40's), Ginsberg is led down into a seedier world near Harlem by Carr. He is exposed to jazz and blues music, drinking & drugs and the intelligentsia of society. At a party he meets Burroughs (Ben Foster), lying in a dry bathtub inhaling nitrous oxide. He also meets the host of the party, David Kammerer (Michael C. Hall), holding realm over the rest and seemingly having a controlling eye on Carr.

The immediate friendship between Ginsberg, Carr and Burroughs develops as they come up with a concept, a manifesto if you will, about the change that is to come in art and society, a new vision. Led by Carr who offers up ideas left and right, Ginsberg is so caught up in the moment that he fails to realize that Carr has rarely if ever come upon an idea on his own. Hints are dropped everywhere that most if not all of his ideas come from Kammerer. As the movie progresses we soon discover that Kammerer does indeed have a hold over Carr. The most obvious hold is that he writes all of Carr's papers for his classes. The other is that he has involved Carr in a homosexual relationship; a relationship not only frowned upon at the time but illegal as well.

Through it all Ginsberg remains oblivious on the surface. At the same time he's developing his own crush on Carr. Never involved in a relationship prior Ginsberg feels his developing homosexuality grow the more involved he becomes with Carr.

The three friends ramble on about art and how they will change the world. They bring Carr's friend Jack Kerouac into their plans. They display their rebellion in acts like breaking into the library and replacing rare display case books with erotic books kept locked up. They fail to go to class and yet consider themselves part of the University, intent on changing it all the while. Always hanging on is Kammerer, trying to control Carr while Ginsberg begins to do all in his power to part the two. Eventually the conflict that develops will end in murder and revelations for all as to who they truly are.

The worshipfulness on display by the screenwriter and director for the beat generation runs rampant here. It's as if they feel these characters can do no wrong no matter what they do, as if they are the cool kids that they so long wanted to be. The same holds true for the actors, especially Radcliff. Why is it that child stars always seem to leap towards roles that require them to either undress or do ""adult"" things to prove they are truly actors? Radcliff has done nudity on stage and here offers us a gay lovemaking scene that while not showing the entire act leaves little to the imagination. Straight sex scenes in movies have become boring. Gay sex scenes to me seem done for little more than shock value.

In the end I couldn't recommend this film to anyone with the exception of the gay community who will proclaim it a standard by which all films should be made. It will also be a film that those who criticize will find themselves called homophobic over. There are some truly great movies made concerning the topic of homosexuality and offering an understanding viewpoint. This is not one of them. From a movie standpoint to me it was boring and felt as if it was in love with itself.

Excellent acting. Excellent attention to all sorts of cinematic details that make the narrative flow smoothly from beginning to end.

I knew young men and women who were as hell-bent on turning the world upside down, giving their pointless existence a real sense of purpose--however artificially manufactured in their minds from the remnants of thinkers of the past like Baudelaire and Yeats. And I was even involved in an obsessive relationship every bit as intense as that of David and Lucien but, quite by accident, without tragic results.

5555284,4,B00B4J2L4E,"A film that was expected by many people, because of an actor who were getting out of a teenage part that had lasted six or seven years, like Daniel Radcliffe, or an actor surviving a long series, and his own cancer, like Michael C. Hall. But as for me the main reason was the subject of that film, the birth of the beat generation, the meeting of the main protagonists of the beat generation to be and become. We are in 1943 and we meet young students at Columbia University in New York. They are all going to be the writers and poets of that post war lost generation that will beat their guilt out of their minds and beat us down into our own guilt.

We all know Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, William Burroughs and Lucien Carr. It is true the fifth character of this pentacle, David Kammerer, is not really known for what he has achieved in his own life, what he has left behind under his own name. He just was the English teacher who fell in love with his pupil Lucien Carr who fell in love too but as a teenager who had to grow out of this pubescent love and did not know how to do it, especially since David Kammerer did not know he had to yield and step away. Instead of that he followed the young man and haunted him.

Our four future poets and writers  were all in breaking rules and experimenting all kinds of strange things, drugs, morphine, alcohol of course, marihuana, but also the excitement and thrill they could get out of violating some good old standards in their society, like sexual taboos and rejected sexual orientations. But they all had to break themselves, to collide into one another and bruise, hurt and even dismantle one another and themselves. It looks as if their future talent had to be born in the blood of a sacrificed innocent man whose sole crime was to love one of them excessively, obsessively, compulsively. That's the most dramatic and unexplainable fact in their lives and careers. They all needed that death to become. I just hope they were haunted by their guilt till the end of their own lives.

Strangely enough their society was lenient, even for the actual murderer, and that can be explained easily by the fact that David Kammerer was gay and their society at the time was definitely and irredeemably antigay. Lucien Carr could have pleaded non guilty because David Kammerer being a homosexual, he had the right to defend his honor and kill him. But Allan Ginsberg, definitely, and Jack Kerouac more or less, not to speak of William Burroughs who was retrieved and taken away by his own father, had to tell the truth in a way or another, and to let everyone, and Lucien Carr first of all, know the truth: Lucien Carr was in love with David Kammerer, which made him a homosexual too. He thus had to accept the verdict of murder in the first degree. And yet he only got eighteen months of probationary detention. Quite cheap for the life of a man, even a homosexual!

But what remains the real truth for us is that these four poets and writers found their inspiration and force in those mixed orientations and in that crime, described in all its ugliness: discover the details in the film itself. And we are shown the horror twice, plus told about it in full detail one third time, along with the first visual demonstration. No way for us not to know the obsessive and compulsive obligation, necessity, impulse, desire and even fascination to commit that murder, to kill that man, slowly and systematically, as some kind of a last final commitment to each other till death them part and death, inflicted by the young man to the older man, does part them.

We will say it is very romantic to find one's artistic inspiration in one's suffering, but here that romanticism is sadistic since they find their inspiration in the suffering they inflict onto one another, including onto an outsider who tries to stick to their small circle of . . . what can we call them? Friends? I doubt it.

The film is packed with fast action, rich piles of artifacts and props, and the actors are all quite seasoned in their guilt and non-repentance, the non-repentance of some crocodiles shedding tears on the suffering of others when they only shed tears on their own misery which is no misery at all since anyway they will be able to use their families or their connections to get through. The film does not in any way acclaim, applaud and approve of this beat generation, but it rather shows how they were lost because they were from more or less well off families: they hated it but they used it skillfully in order to avoid punishment or to get a second chance. The only one who really did it with his own hands is Jack Kerouac, but he was like the fifth wheel of a wagon, the one who took part but did not really belong.

But the film also contains some easy symbolism like showing William Burroughs shooting himself with morphine, Allen Ginsberg being sexually penetrated by some unknown outsider he had accidently picked in the street, and Lucien Carr repeatedly stabbing David Kammerer. It is easy and it is also farfetched as if drug addiction, gay sex and killing a gay partner were the same thing, as if gay orientation led necessarily to anal sex shown on the screen, a syringe in your arm and a knife in the chest of your lover, the three at the same time and in close and dense succession. It even could sound like exposure more than fair presentation. Is the film ambiguous about this beat generation?

5555291,4,B00B4J2L4E,"Had most of us been associated with these characters back in their day, likely we wouldn't have connected with them. Kill Your Darlings solves that with a script and characterizations that make these counter-culture/subversives relateable and comprehensible while still giving us the essence of them.  The film tries to do a lot, although handling scenes in short attention span deftness. It is all at once about the start of the counter-culture revolution in American Literature, The Beat Generation. It's about the coming together of these boys and the impetus that started their evolution; the pieces that clicked and sparked an outcome that changed things forever. It's about a murder and Ginsbergs coming out. It's about influence, obsession and loss. It's about how those boys challenged norms, and morality and the lengths people feel they have to go to be understood and freed. It's a glimpse into how suppression of human nature, creativity and spirit, even through nurtured cultural and educational herding from the most well intentioned institutions will likely cause a boil over. All of these themes were handled fine by me; they're barely touched on, just enough to make a point but lack a cohesive thread, a map of sorts. This kept me a bit at a distance emotionally. By all accounts the real Lucian Carr possessed an engaging, influential quality that enraptured people within the circles he ran. Dane DeHaan, though a fine actor, does not seem to possess those qualities, nor portray them well. The film is handled well enough to make it moot. Ben Foster is a favorite actor of mine. His William Burroughs was one note and obvious. Even though Burroughs was a great friend of David Kammerer, his pivotal moments in the story bear little weight. Whoever played Kourac made him barely matter at all. That all said the story is well told, from the perspective of a Ginsburg unexpectedly well played by Daniel Ratcliff. Ratcliff doesn't so much transform; (although better than James Franco in Howl) he fit the part REALLY well. The production looks top notch. Though missing a connection for all things, pacing steadily escalates climbing with layered plotting and atmospheric cinematography. Don't credit the characterizations nor events as historically accurate. It's like a story told years later with conjecture to fill in the blanks, by the descendant of someone who was told the story by someone who was connected.  None-the-less, it's interesting, very well made, well acted and smartly paced.

5555292,4,B00B4J2L4E,"I will admit, I am not entirely familiar with the Beat Generation.  In fact, I hadnt even heard the term, despite knowing the names involved, until I saw this film.  How embarrassing is that!  On the other hand, I was familiar with the time, the place and the people mentioned, to at least a degree strong enough to make their names, actions and contributions ring true to me.  While never having read any of his work, Jack Kerouac is a name Im very familiar with, as is William S. Burroughs, and while I didn't know all the surrounding circumstances, I was at least familiar with the murder of David Kammerer.

I knew it happened, and that Lucien Carr was responsible.

For me, a film like Kill Your Darlings works almost for the same reason that it doesnt work.  It is, in essence, two separate films wedged together to create something that resembles a whole film, but because of that it steps away from the obvious at times long enough to create something that feels more stimulating.  While it does deal with the murder itself, and the relationships that surround the people involved (either through actions or knowledge), the film is steeped in something bigger than that.

And yet, one can easily fault the film for spreading itself too thin in an attempt to cover more than necessary, for some of the issues it claims to consider wind up feeling very lost in the shuffle.

Its a mixed bag, and so is this review.

First, Ill lay out everything I liked about this.  Dane DeHane delivers one of the truest star is born performances Ive seen since Jude Law in The Talented Mr. Ripley, and quite frankly the performance itself felt very similar.  He is so electric on the screen, so in your face and yet so fragile and complicated and so much more than he seems.  He handles every complexity within Lucien Carr with such finesse.  His tantrums, his introverted fears, his outlandish attention-seeking whorishness, his complete ability to engulf a room; all of these facets make this such a marvelously layered and commanding performance.  Speaking of Carr, I felt like his sub-plot, in all of its facets, felt the most grounded.  The development, however unsettled, of his relationship with Krammerer and with Kurouac and with Ginsberg all felt like they had such rich detail and identity, and all of them felt unique and complete in their own right.  In fact, the entire ensemble was so well composed.  Foster, Hall, Huston and even Radcliffe (although he was easily the least interesting aspect of the film) are all up to the task here.  Radcliffe was certainly eager to shed any inkling of Harry Potter, and he did so with dignity intact.

Sadly, the least successful aspect of the film is the construction of the Beat Generation itself.  While these men are all so interesting in their own right (especially Carr and Kerouac), their established generation felt so lazily put together and not entirely complete.  By the films end, I was struggling to understand what made their cause so special, or really what their cause was all about (other than offending the world with literature considered vile).  This is an issue, because it feels underdeveloped in an area that needed the most development.

Still, as a character study, this is pretty dynamic in so many different ways, and watching Ginsberg soak in the people in his life, feeding off of them in order to find his own identity was pretty alarming and rewarding.  As an ensemble, it is also really strong.  I just wish that it worked as strongly as a statement on the times, because then it would have felt as well-rounded as it wanted to be.",1397088000,,3608,4.722044728434505

5555297,5,B00B4J2L4E,"Director and co-writer (with Austin Bunn) John Krokidas have created an atmospheric visit to the beginnings of one of literary history's great movements - the Beat Generation - and in doing so have carved a fine story that combines not only the rise of the Beats but also examines the slow emergence of recognition of sexual identity crises, in both a positive and a critical manner. Cast with a group of very fine actors and accompanied with musical director Nico Muhly's sensitive score that includes the references to Brahms symphonies and trios and transcriptions of themes along with terrific excerpts from Harlem's jazz scene (courtesy of Dawn Newman as a jazz singer), this film is successful on many levels, not the least of which is the reminder of the permanent impact on American literature and sociology imprinted by the likes of Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and William Burroughs. The very sensitive opening sequence, appreciated only at film's end, sets the dark tone of the film and opens the window to understanding the Beats (also called ""the Libertine Circle"" by Ginsberg).

The time is the mid 1940s and Allen Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliff) is an English major in Columbia University, assigned to be the roommate of Lucien 'Make me cry or make me horny' Carr (Dane DeHann) who awakens Ginsberg's rebellious self and introduces him to the work of Rimbaud. Dissatisfied by the orthodox attitudes of the school, Ginsberg finds himself drawn to iconoclastic colleagues like the egotistical but genius Lucien Carr, William S. Burroughs (Ben Foster) and Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston). Together, this gang would explore bold new literary ideas that would challenge Columbia University's staid stance and the sensibilities of their time as the future Beat Generation. However, for all their creativity, their very appetites and choices lead to more serious transgressions that would mark their lives forever. Lucien has been stalked since age 14 by the older gay David Kammerer (Michael C. Hall) who sees Lucien as his lover, but in this version of the story Lucien acted out his same sex proclivities with both Ginsberg and Kerouac. Lucien murders Kammerer and drags his body into the Hudson River (recall the  opening scene of the film) and it is the advice of both Kerouac and Burroughs that leads to the judgment of the questionable verdict. Ginsberg goes on to create `Howl' and Kerouac moves toward `On the Road' and Carr becomes a journalist. Despite the at times confusing dichotomy between the murder story and the literary awakening the Beats introduced, this is a fascinating depiction of a movement of enormous impact.

John Krokidas captures all the essence of the times in the 1940s New York City and his actors - especially Daniel Radcliff - bring this story to life. There is an uncredited role of Lucien Carr's mother superbly played by Kyra Sedgwick and any number of other fleeting bit parts that add to the mystique of the period. Recommended on many levels.

However, sometimes infatuation turns dark and can become dangerous. The performances are good. Jennifer Jason Leigh steals the few scenes she's in.

5555305,5,B00B4J2L4E,"Kill Your Darlings is one of the best films of 2013 and certainly the most interesting film that I've seen regarding the group of individuals collectively referred to as The Beats. It has recently been released on DVD and video (for rent or purchase). The movie covers only a short period of time in their lives which includes the pivotal event which helped to shape their future and provide a significant contribution to their future literary work.

Kill Your Darlings begins with Allen Ginsberg (played by Daniel Radcliffe) enrolling at Columbia University and meeting Lucien Carr (played by Dane DeHaan). Lucien Carr then introduces Ginsberg to David Kammerer (played by Michael C Hall), William S Burroughs (played by Ben Foster) and Jack Kerouac (played by Jack Huston). During the first part of the film, we see them interact in ways that gives us insight into their thought processes and their unique approach to the world. This is an interesting introduction to The Beats; but it is not the main subject of this film.

WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD! If you are not familiar with the murder of David Kammerer or prefer to see the film before knowing more about it, stop reading now; but please come back once you've seen the film to read more. Comments and discussion are always welcome.

Lucien Carr was nineteen years old when he murdered David Kammerer who was approximately fifteen years his senior. The two formed a close relationship when Lucien was only fourteen while both were living in St Louis. David Kammerer was obviously totally infatuated with Lucien Carr. That is not in dispute. Over the years as Lucien moved from school to school, David also moved to Lucien's new location so that he could be near the younger man. What is in dispute is Lucien's actual feelings about David Kammerer and the extent of their physical relationship. You will see many accounts which paint Kammerer as a stalker; but if you dig more deeply into the facts, it is apparent that Carr did not totally object to David's affection and did not seriously attempt to extricate himself from the relationship. In fact it is clear that regardless of the extent of their physical relationship, Lucien made ample use of Kammerer when it suited him.

Let's get one sticky point out of the way right now. Fifteen years is a big age difference in any relationship; and it is certainly even more a problem when one of the two is a teenager. However, before assigning labels like child molestation, statutory rape or similar terms, I think we do need to remember the time period during which these events occurred. The legal age of consent was generally much lower at that time than it is today. In fact, it may surprise you to learn that until fairly recently fourteen was still the legal age of consent in a few states; fifteen was even more common. Today the age of consent has been raised in almost all states with sixteen being the most common. However, in the first and middle part of the twentieth century things were different. Young people grew up faster then. I'm certainly not suggesting that this was a good thing; but when we consider events from a different period of time, it may not be wise to judge them by current day standards.

With that out of the way, let's continue by saying that over the years Lucien Carr accompanied David Kammerer on trips that included only the two of them and maintained a close relationship in several locales. As far as we know, Lucien never made a serious attempt to end the relationship or dissuade David in a very real way. Even though Lucien's mother did not approve of the relationship, she also did nothing terribly definitive toward ending it. When Lucien attempted to commit suicide the year before the events in this film unfold, David saved his life and was listed as the next of kin on the hospital admitting form.

As Kill Your Darlings opens, it is 1944; and the locale is New York City. Lucien is nineteen and David is about thirty four. In some ways it does appear that Lucien is now finally ready to move on without David Kammerer in his life. Lucien makes new friends and complains about David to them. However, Lucien still allows David to be a part of his life. One of the first events in the film shows Lucien taking Allen Ginsberg to David's apartment to attend a party. In fact he continues to allow David to tag along with him and his new friends wherever they go. He uses David to write school papers for him. Lucien spends alone time with David and seems unsure whether he wants to actually remove David from his life. As events unfold, there comes a time when the two of them are on a walk alone together in a park on the upper west side of Manhattan where an argument occurs and Lucien stabs David in the chest several times with a knife. David is mortally wounded but not yet dead. Lucien weighs David down by placing rocks in his pockets and drags him into the Hudson River to drown. Lucien takes David's eyeglasses and the murder weapon with him.

Lucien seeks advice from William S Burroughs, who advises Lucien to get a lawyer and turn himself in; but Lucien doesn't especially like that advice at the odd moment. He turns to Jack Kerouac who helps him dispose of the glasses and knife and accompanies Lucien on a day of drinking, museum visiting, cinema hopping and the like. Eventually Lucien does turn himself in, claims that the murder was a result of defending his honor against a homosexual advance and eventually gets a light sentence in a reformatory. (Did I mention that it was 1944? Homosexual panic was a much easier defense back then than it is today.)

William S Burroughs and Jack Kerouac were also arrested as accessories. Things worked out even better for them as they spent little time in jail before making bail. Even though it is clear from their later writing about the crime that they were aware of the complexities of the case, they both decided that since David Kammerer was dead and Lucien Carr was alive, it was best to throw their support behind Lucien's defense and not raise any doubt about its authenticity.

Lucien Carr served eighteen months for the murder of David Kammerer in a reformatory instead of a prison. He went on to become a respected journalist for UPI and was married and had children. He maintained his friendship with Ginsberg, Burroughs & Kerouac for the rest of their lives but never sought fame or recognition in the same way his friends did.

Let us now turn to the final point of dispute. Was the relationship between Lucien Carr and David Kammerer a physical one? Kill Your Darlings unfolds from the point of view of Allen Ginsberg who certainly believed that the relationship between Kammerer and Carr either was or had been very physical. Ginsberg states in his memoirs and elsewhere that he also had a physical relationship with Lucien Carr during the first part of their friendship and provides other interesting personal observations regarding Lucien's relationships with men. William S Burroughs said that he did not believe the relationship between Kammerer and Carr was physical; but that statement may have been an attempt to help and reinforce Lucien Carr's honor defense for the murder of David Kammerer. We know from the later writing of Ginsberg, Burroughs and Kerouac that none were unaware of the complexities of the situation.

Another point of view regarding the relationship between Carr and Kammerer is offered by the author, Caleb Carr (Lucien's Carr's son), in a recent posting on the internet. After reading the lengthy piece, I couldn't find a great deal with it that differed from the movie except for one thing. Caleb Carr seemed very determined to prove that his father was NOT gay. He had no trouble referring to his father as a ""monster"", ""abuser"" and good at using homosexuals for his own benefit. He accused his father of abusing him when he was a youngster; but he wanted to assure the reader that his father was not a homosexual. I couldn't help but think that I would personally prefer a father who was a closet homosexual to one who was a monster, abuser and clever manipulator of the gay people in his life. Caleb Carr seems also to be convinced that this film is part of a Hollywood homosexual agenda to prove that all men are gay. I'm not sure I understand that viewpoint. Nothing about the film suggests that viewpoint at all.

5555309,4,B00B4J2L4E,"This is like a less fictional version of the 1980s Masterpiece Theater Classic series Brideshead Revisited. As in that series, we have a young innocent coming onto campus and soon being captivated by a handsome, epicene upper classman.

Like Bridesheads Sebastian before him, Lucien Carr is shown here inciting those in his circle to exotic sensualities and sexual experimentation. Like a King Cobra, his gaze has hypnotized others before Ginsberg. But when he is through with them, they are not always ready to be through with him. Thats where the tragedy of this association of Burroughs/Kerouac/Ginsberg/Carr germinates.

5555311,5,B00B4J2L4E,"This historical fiction, period piece about the intellectual and sexual coming out of American poet Allen Ginsberg, was entertaining, informative, and indicative of the struggle between reason and dogma. The film starring Daniel Radcliffe as Ginsberg, Dane Dehaan, as Lucien Carr, Ben Foster as William S. Burroughs, and Michael C. Hall as David Kammerer told the story about the influences of older, worldlier, and more experienced men, Carr and Kammerer on younger, vulnerable, impressionable lads Ginsberg and Carr(himself both pupil and tutor). The action is set within the walls of traditional and conservative Columbia University where the metronomic beat of iambic pentameter  doggedly provides students of poetry the drumbeat to which they are expected to march out their nascent works. But Carr quickly takes in the gawky, questioning Ginsberg and opens him up to the jois de vivre in NYC during the Bohemian era. The beautiful, blond-haired Carr is entwined in a relationship with Kammerer and trades sexual favors in return for Kammerer writing Carr's papers for him. Yet Carr exhorts Ginsberg to write, albeit to the mind-pulsing beat of amphetamines provided by the drug addled Burroughs. Meanwhile the clever, provocative, yet crafty Lucien pits Ginsberg against his jealous suitor Kammerer, who resents the close friendship between Lucien and Allen., especially his keen awareness of the incipient romantic and sexual bonding between the two young men. Kammerer, who works as a janitor, providing an apartment to which Lucien and Allen go to escape the stuffy confines of Columbia, jealously and mawkishly hovers over the free-spirited and morally loose Carr engendering a murderous hatred shared by Carr and Ginsberg for Kammerer., The story abounds with the pathos and stresses of Ginsberg's emerging sexuality and artistic development fostered in jazz nightclubs and under the sheets of Lucien Carr's bed. Further complicating matters for Ginsberg is the appearance of  the cocksure wildness of Jack Kerouac on the scene as Lucien Carr's working class hero and rough-trade love interest. The story unfolds rather predictably culminating in the jailing of Lucien Carr for the fatal stabbing of Kammerer, the self chosen expelling of Ginsberg from Columbia, and the reluctant returning of Burroughs to the aegis of his wealthy family, showing once again that in modern American culture gay love must end tragically.",1395360000,2,2431,5.445623342175066

I have to tell you, I was blown away.
Stellar performances by Daniel Radcliffe, Dane DeHaan, and Michael C. Hall. Several things crossed my mind while I watched this movie. First and somewhat comical was a phrase by the Divine Miss M ""People were doing it long before we ever thought about it.""
Odd thing to think about I know when watching a story about Allen Ginsberg, however, the debauchery and drug abuse that went on, I was like ""wow"".
Second thing that crossed my mind was not one time while watching this movie did I not truly think that it was the 1940's. fascinating time for music, which by the way was great.
Something that actually took me by surprise was that Allen Ginsberg was part of the same ""rat pack"" so to speak as Jack Kerouac, the man who wrote ""On the Road"", which by the way was an awesome story in it's own right. However, It did not occur to me that the Jack portrayed in the movie was the same man. Not until the very end of the movie was I enlightened to that fact.
Another thing that, I will not say was a downer so to speak, and literally was just moments in the movie, was the judiciary view on homosexuality. I was like wow, really? your kidding me.
Over all. A very well made movie. Fascinating story that held my interest. Stunning performances. Awesome recreation of the 1940's. Wonderful music.

Daniel Radcliffe was amazing. The murder scene and the accompanying music was absolutely fascinating and oddly weird. John Krokidas definitely created a noir feel.

Since all the real-life principals involved in this based on a true story film are dead, it would be wise to be wary of those claiming to know what really happened--especially antigay authors, journalists, and right-wing Web sites that clearly have an axe to grind. Instead consider reading the novel that inspired this movie and was written by two of the principals involved who were there:

First off, I'm sure that there are discrepancies between this film and the real story of the Columbia University love-triangle of Allen Ginsburg, Lucien Carr, and David Kammerer. I'm judging KILL YOUR DARLINGS according to story-value, not historical accuracy.

KILL YOUR DARLINGS is well-filmed and well-played, and Daniel Radcliffe is particularly memorable as the young Allen Ginsburg. It shows a great deal about how he was influenced and changed by the early Columbia ""Beat"" circle of Burroughs, Kerouac, and others such as Carr whose names, for various reasons, have been largely forgotten. It realistically evokes the 1940s, and the story of WWII is skillfully paralleled with that of the young writers' circle. Their college-boy pretensions, which, nevertheless, have real sincerity behind them, also shine through very well. Coincidentally, it's intriguing to see the horribly inconsistent laws regarding homosexuals, as well as the level of ""in loco parentis"" control universities wielded at the time.

Not to sound snooty, but one needs some basic familiarity with the major literary characters and the Beat movement in general in order to really appreciate and enjoy this film. Those who aren't into fiction and poetry of the sort written by these characters may be rather bored with KILL YOUR DARLINGS. Otherwise, while there are a few patchy spots, the whole tale of the antics, jealousies, and everything else that happens in the young libertine writers' circle, ending with a murder and the dilemmas that follow, makes for a gripping and very intelligent movie.",1395187200,,1591,5.356
5555317,1,B00B4J2L4E,"Do yourself a favor. Google ""Lucien Carr Daily Caller"" and read the account of what really happened. It will answer the question of why Lucien Carr's family was never consulted on this film.",1395100800,3,190,4.787878787878788
5555318,4,B00B4J2L4E,"This is a very well done movie, but it slanders Lucien Carr.  The killing was not premediated. Lucien admitted to his girlfriend Celine Young (who somehow doesn't make it into the movie - gay boys aren't supposed to have girlfriends) that he was so drunk at the time of the incident that he had only the vaguest memory of what had occurred.  Burroughs, who was David Kammerer's closest friend, felt that David's obsession had gotten totally out of hand and that he had forced Carr into a ""love me or kill me"" situation.  Burroughs was also convinced that David and Lucien had never been sexually intimate.  Lucien Carr was to blame for stringing David Kammerer along for years. As Celine Young wrote to Jack Kerouac: ""Had Lucien felt less pride in having Dave dog his footsteps, he might have gotten rid of Kammerer before this in a socially acceptable manner."" The portrayal of Ginsberg after the killing is totally false.  Ginsberg was upset by the killing because Kammerer was a good friend, but he wrote in his journal that he could not find it in his heart to condemn Carr.",1394409600,9,1078,4.652631578947369
5555319,4,B00B4J2L4E,"This story is a historical drama concerning the life of Allen Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliffe) and his time at Columbia University. The story centers on the events leading up to the murder of David Kammerer (Michael C. Hall) by Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan) of which we gets glimpses of in the beginning. The film concentrates on the complex relationship of Ginsberg and Carr, from their writing, to sharing of private lives, to their ""New Vision"" their ""rearrangement of the senses"" to their lover relationship.

Other characters include Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston) and William Burroughs (Ben Foster). They created an avant-garde culture by rejecting cultural values, and in a way were the anti-Fitzgeralds while being them.

Danie Radcliffe shows us that if you spend enough time in front of a camera, you can one day be an actor. He was excellent in his role, as were the supporting cast. I would have appreciated a more colorful Jack Kerouac.

A good historical drama for those who might find interest in the topic.

5555320,4,B00B4J2L4E,"""Under the right circumstances even he might change the world."" Columbia University in the 1940's unknowingly gave life to some of the best poets in the world. Alan Ginsberg (Radcliffe) shows up and is almost instantly dissatisfied with what he finds. The school is too straight laced as far as teaching goes. He meets future legends Lucien Carr (DeHaan), William S. Burroughs and Jack Kerouac. What starts off as a group trying to change the world spirals out of control until a murder changes the lives of all of them. I have never been ""hip"" or into the beat poet scene. Never been a fan of Kerouac or even a big fan of Hunter S. Thompson for that matter. Not really sure why but they just never appealed to me. I watched On The Road but wasn't that impressed so I wasn't all that excited about watching this one. I do have to admit that this was much better then I expected. This one had a Dead Poet's Society aspect to it and I think that is why I ended up liking it. If you are a fan of the beat poet generation then you will love this. I liked how the character interactions grew to an explosive resolution, that was interesting to me. Overall, much better then On The Road, but this movie made me want to watch that one again now that I know more about the relationships. I give this a B.",1394150400,,1296,4.293877551020408

8562370,4,B00B4J2L4E,"From frame one this movie drew me in.  I was loving it.  The writing, the sets, the details, the music, the acting and the actors were great, until the awful wall of modern day music slammed into the film during the library break-in scene.  It really blew the believability right out of the movie.  Ok, I realize the film makers are young, and didn't know how dangerous their firecracker could be.

Scene over.  Movie resumes to being really good.  My only concern is authenticity in a couple of spots.  One is where the homemade audio records are being played.  Voice-o-graph recording booths did exist in the 1940s.  And yes, a few thousand Service men and women had a one time opportunity to send a recorded message home.  However,  the average person hadn't actually ever seen, much less made one of these recordings.  This was not a part of everday life in America.  Perhaps the message being read from a letter would have been more effective.

Lastly, in my opinion, the characters were far too open with their sexuality for the times.  That statement may be hard for younger adults to fully get a grip on.  Having the wrong people figuring out you were homosexual could wreak havoc on your life.  It's hard to understand how afraid the establishment was of gays, and how afraid gays were of the establishment.

So there you have it, the opinion of someone who has been observing life in America for sixty-six years.",1521158400,,1422,4.661290322580645
