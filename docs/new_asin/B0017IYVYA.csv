8266183,5,B0017IYVYA,Just received this concert in the mail and discovered it was a Region 2 format for viewing in Europe. I was disappointed until I realized my computer would adjust to it and I was able to watch it on my monitor. The Palast Orchester with Max Raabe is never a disappointment. There is such attention paid to every detail that all their shows are near perfection. You only have to watch their audiences to realize what good-feeling music they are creating. And the joy created by the little bits and antics of the orchestra members are a delight. They will be here in the states this spring and I will be attending. You should too.,1297036800,8,628,4.469565217391304
