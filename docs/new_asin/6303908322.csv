722858,1,6303908322,"Fashion magnate, Michael Jardine (C. Thomas Howell- THE HITCHER) discovers the dead body of his ex-wife on the beach. Thus begins Michael's journey into a nightmare world of murder and mayhem. HOURGLASS also gives many insights into the ridiculous universe of 90s high-fashion, along w/ the latest exercise crazes and music of the era! Sofia Shinas co-stars as Dara Jensen, a beautiful woman who simply shows up in Michael's life one day. Michael has recurring dreams about his ex-wife's murder, while a cop  (Ed Begley Jr.) is on the case. HOURGLASS is an erotic / erratic ""thriller"". Howell and Shinas do have a certain ""chemistry"", in the same way that burritos and excess stomach acid have ""chemistry"". Unfortunately, as disjointed and idiotic as it all is, HOURGLASS is also extremely boring (the one unpardonable sin). This is heartbreaking, because w/ a bit more care, it could have rivaled TROLL 2! I mean, how many movies contain cameos by both Carrot Top AND Donny Most?! Besides, I shall never get the image of the chubby guy in his black underwear, disco dancing in front of his mirror, out of my now-charred mind! His murder brought only temporary relief...",1392076800,2,1170,4.939086294416244
722859,3,6303908322,"You can see from the quality that this is an older movie, but it is still enjoyable considering. (It's like watching a VHS instead of Blue-Ray, personally I enjoy it because of the sound quality and grain of the film, but this might annoy others). Theres not much fashion in this, more business deals and character development than anything else.  The soundtrack fits well and standard for the decade. The plot moves along okay, I would recommend this movie if you're bored and want to watch anything murder-mystery.
What to expect: after a successful and wealthy fashion designer falls very ill his two sons step up to take over the family business. The movie follows the oldest son and his youngest brother as they try to keep the business profitable. A woman suddenly appears and begins stalking him until he falls into a relationship with her. Throughout the movie the eldest sons wife mysteriously turns up murdered, then a staff member, then his brother and soon after his world is turned completely upside down. The plot skips around a little to give perspective on the different entanglements but isn't too hard to follow.",1384214400,,1130,4.8549222797927465
722860,1,6303908322,"C. Thomas Howell's performance in this movie is absolutely awful. You talk about over the top! I noticed he also produced it. I suppose it's possible he realized it was a dog and was trying to save it. To say the least, it didn't work! Skip it.",1015372800,2,244,4.212765957446808

722962,2,6303908322,Confusing movie that clears it up in the last three minutes of the movie. It was weird seeing Kiefer Sutherland in basically a cameo role as a doctor.,1452729600,,150,4.392857142857143
722963,2,6303908322,"I had heard such bad reviews about this I was expecting it to be terrible but really it wasn't that bad, nothing amazing but usually I'll just turn something off if I can't sit through it, but this was entertaining enough, I didn't feel the acting stood out as being bad or anything either. The funny thing about this though is that they have released it under the title 'Time runs out' and there's a picture of Keifer Sutherland on the cover holding a gun, I think they're trying to make it out to be like his TV show '24', but just so you know Kiefer Sutherland appears for about two seconds playing a doctor!",1446508800,,611,4.321739130434783
