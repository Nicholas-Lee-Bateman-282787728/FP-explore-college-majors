This did not have: 57 Chevy with Bob Hope, -most of the ads they say on the back of this DVD, Are not here..
I paid roughly $7, plus shipping, I recieved this a month later. I'm not sure if this was an accident, I was hoping for the car ads, and the celebrity ones, as that was why I purchased. I rated this fair as there are a few celebrities here, and some nice memories, though the ones everyone recieved, and the back of this set, do not match. The in screen is only in 4 categories, and no listing. A partial refund would be nice..
Update: The DVD serial number: Cat0183-6  and the box says: Cat0181-6. There was a mix up, somewhere, mystery solved.--",1513209600,,2717,5.53125
