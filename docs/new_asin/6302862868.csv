8261089,4,6302862868,"I rented this movie for a cheap thrill and a couple of chuckles, and ended up viewing a surprisingly entertaining and downright funny movie.  Sort of an early American Pie, this movie follows four boys in their quest to get laid.  This is where the paths of the two movies divirge, however, the boys unite under the idea of holding auditions for a phony porno flick.  This is where the movie really starts to get funny.  Be forewarned, however, that this movie is not really intelectual humor, but if you are a fan of Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, or any other comedians of this type, you should definately give this movie a try.",995500800,6,627,4.522123893805309
