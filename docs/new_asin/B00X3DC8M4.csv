8714848,4,B00X3DC8M4,"I wonder how Alfred Hitchcock would've fared had he directed The Secret Partner, what extra flourishes he would've tossed in? There are elements and touches and tropes in 1961's The Secret Partner that smack of Hitchcock's sensibilities. Only, you have to slog thru the torpid first twenty or thirty minutes, and then it gets good.

The movie presents two perspectives. We observe the goings-on thru the eyes of John Brent (Stewart Granger), a London shipping executive with an estranged wife and a past that comes back to haunt him. He comes to inhabit one of Hitchcock's most celebrated tropes, that of the innocent man on the run. Hot on his trail is our other point-of-view figure, Scotland Yard Detective Superintendent Frank Hambury (Bernard Lee) as he tries to unravel what started out as an open-and-shut case that alarmingly develops into an almighty puzzler comprising blackmail, infidelity, and grand theft - which I think are three of the ten commandments, am I right?

It's a black & white British thriller from MGM that I almost turned off after twenty minutes, except I persevered and was rewarded with nifty twists and turns and a plot that gets really cooking halfway thru the movie. There are some nice performances, from Granger's likable/unlikable protagonist, to Israeli actress Haya Harareet's unpredictable femme fatale turn, to Norman Bird's super-creepy dentist, to Bernard Lee's wonderful turn as the rumpled, slovenly, near-retirement Detective Superintendent who can't seem to keep cigarette ash from decorating the front of his coat.

I appreciate that Granger isn't quite the intrepid sleuth, that, several times, he would arrive at a theory only for someone to shoot it down with obvious logic. But maybe one shouldn't blame Granger too much. It's a hell of a serpentine plot. This movie also reaffirms my distrust of dentists and their inherent sadistic nature.",1531440000,,1893,5.1797385620915035
