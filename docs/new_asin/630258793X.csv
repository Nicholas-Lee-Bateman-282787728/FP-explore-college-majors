484194,3,630258793X,"""The Swarm"" is merely another in the long line of 1970's disaster flicks that the Hollywood machine churned out with almost reckless abandon.  The difference here is that, instead of burning building or shaking ground, the disaster is a swarm of 'Africanized' killer bees that attack southern Texas with extreme ferocity.  While there is no doubt that killer bees do exist and are quite vicious when they attack, this particular swarm seems capable of doing things that not even the USSR could have imagined accomplishing.  These bees cause helicopters to crash, force passenger trains off the track, and... get this... cause a nuclear power plant to explode (!).  These are some pretty impressive bees.  For all the outlandishly ridiculous plot developments, ""The Swarm"" is still a fun movie to watch.  It's especially fun to watch actors of higher pedigree try to contend with this material.  On the one hand, there is Richard Chamberlain, an actor wants badly to be a better actor than the material he performs lets him be.  On the other hand, there is Oscar-winner, Michael Caine, who shows a propensity for choosing awful roles at the same rate as he chooses award-winning roles (how else can you explain a man who wins Academy Awards in such compelling films as ""Hannah and her Sisters"" and ""The Cider House Rules"", while also starring in such monumental turkeys as ""Jaws: The Revenge"" and ""Beyond the Poseidon Adventure"").  It's fun watching the two of them recite the dialogue of this movie and seeing them not smirk at what they're saying.  ""The Swarm"" is a bad, bad movie, but it has that extra bit of flair that allows it to be so bad it's good.",1025827200,3,1656,4.819787985865724
484195,4,630258793X,"THE SWARM is a legendary flop from Irwin Allen, the kind that destroys careers. Hyped from here to the moon, and called ""the most terrifying movie ever made"" by Allen himself, prior to its release, scientists everywhere were worried that it would cause a mass panic about bees. Not quite. THE SWARM turned out to be a bad movie. Drop your jaw bad. A movie that makes you ask again and again ""What made them think this would work!?"" A movie so bad that it is capable of giving the bad movie lover a buzz akin to those given by other substances.
When the always inept military finds a whole bunch of people dead at a nuclear missile base they think Chemical Warfare. Wrong. Turns out it was a huge swarm of mutated African Killer Bees from Brazil (The Bees from Brazil?) that has illegally immigrated to Texas and now threatens The World (or at least Houston, same thing).
Stirling Silliphant's script is so incredibly bad that some b-movie fans put forth that THE SWARM is really a snide parody of 50s mutant bug flicks instead of a serious thriller (check out Ken Begg's 50s schlock check list in his review of the movie at jabootu.com). Either way it does a real disservice to Arthur Herzog's fine novel, which succeeds in being frightening. The direction by Irwin Allen is lethargic, too often the movie just sits there when it should be moving at a mile a minute, but then again that allows the bad movie lover to sit there and savor each rancid morsel of dialog for all its cheesy glory. On the plus side Jerry Goldsmith contributes yet another fine score for a bad movie. Highly recommended and, believe it or not, this is an essential flick for bad movie lovers everywhere.",1003795200,29,1679,4.544554455445544
484196,4,630258793X,"Irwin Allen's 1978 film THE SWARM, while no one can call it a masterpiece (to put it mildly), is still a long way away from being a PLAN NINE-style clinker.  Yes, the special effects aren't all that great (they were no great shakes either in 1978), the cast is saddled with unusually lame dialogue supplied by Stirling Silliphant (basing the film on Arthur Herzog's novel of the same name).
All of that I will cheerfully agree to.  But the fact is that when I saw this film on TV once, I was very frightened by the bee attacks.  And let's look at it from a purely prophetic point of view: Because THE SWARM is not about European honey-bees but the far more agressive Africanized ones, this can be a terrifying movie if one looks past the so-so effects and the equally so-so script.  Those bees are among us now.  Maybe this film did more good than a lot of people expected.
Perhaps four stars is a bit much, but that's the rating I'd give to so prescient a horror/suspense film as this.",999820800,4,986,4.395604395604396
484197,4,630258793X,"Sometimes I feel sad that ""The Swarm"" didn't do well at the box office back in 1978 since it was produced and directed by 'master of disaster' Irwin Allen.  I think it's an interesting movie with an incredible cast.  Not ""The Towering Inferno"", but it's watchable.
I became an admirer of Michael Caine after watching his portrayal as Dr. Brad Crane, a man on a quest to wipe out killer African Bees.  Richard Widmark is superb as General Slater, and Henry Fonda gives a touch of class as Dr. Krim -Dr. Crane's colleague and mentor.  The supporting cast also give certain class to their own performances, especially Olivia De Havilland, Ben Johnson, and Fred MacMurray playing a 'men&agrave;ge a trois' -maybe that's cheesy, but it's entertaining.
Jerry Goldsmith's powerful score is excellent, and the visual effects are average.  However, some of the extra scenes are unnecessary, and the fact that the people stung by the bees watch giant bees almost all the time is annoying, not to mention out of place.  But I think Irwin Allen's take on this movie was a nice work.  I am looking forward to a widescreen edition.",992649600,5,1117,4.786458333333333

484267,4,630258793X,"5 stars would be too generous.  Nevertheless, The Swarm is a blockbuster B-movie about an invasion of killer bees that bring down helicopters and airplanes and even derail a speeding passenger train.  Michael Caine, Henry Fonda, Richard Chamberlain, Katharine Ross, Patty Duke, Richard Widmark and Fred MacMurray all have roles that lend the film gravitas.  Hundreds die from the venomous stings of the African bees:  men, women, children andspoiler alertFonda, Chamberlain and Widmark.  Alarms go off, the power goes down.  Houston has a problem.

Yet throughout the catastrophe, with its devastating swarms and mounting dead, not a single bee flies up a womans skirt.  Not one.  This fact alone renders the film utterly preposterousunless, of course, its flame throwers that interest you.  The Swarm demonstrates perfectly well how NOT to use a flamethrower indoors.

484316,3,630258793X,"THE SWARM, one of Irwin Allen's last Disaster films which is still enjoyable to watch
Irwin's early Disaster films were the best, The Poseidon Adventure & the Towering Inferno
which had a milestone of incredible special effects for it's time back in 1974
which i still enjoy watching even thou the effects were only practical, meaning none of it was done with Computer imagery
the effects actually looked realistic in both the Poseidon adventure & Towering inferno that's why
both films still stand up today and havn't Dated
anyway the swarm is a massive swarm of Killer Bees from south Africa that have made their way to the United states to kill
Warnerbros first released the film in it's 155min Uncut version way back in 2002
with a behind the scenes featurette INSIDE THE SWARM which was a Vintage promo for the film
made for TV broadcast back in 1978
well Warners have reissued the film again and labelled it part of their WB Archive collection as it says on the front cover art
the film is the exact same 2:35:1 ratio 155min version as the 2002 dvd with the same extras
the only difference is the packaging actually, the old 2002 was cardboard snap case
this new 2016 is clamshell keepcase with the WB Archive collection logo on the front
that's the only difference between the 2 versions
what WB should have done is reissue the film on blu-ray with a new HD transfer & new 5.1 master audio mix
some of WB Archive collection are blu-ray reissues anyway
so for some stupid reason the Swarm wasn't picked for a blu-ray reissue, very tragic i think
5 stars for the film, maybe 3 stars for this new dvd reissue based on better packaging, but no new extras
the very old 2002 dvd is out of print now & very expensive to buy
so your better off buying this new 2016 reissue which has better packaging than the old snap case dvd",1465430400,,1825,4.5

The film lurches about with such gay abandon that you'll be scratching your head trying to figure out what the hell is going on- its only after Michael Caine mentions that the first killing happened weeks before that you realize this hasn't all just happened in an afternoon!

The acting is so hilarious that you will be buckled over with laughter, the action scenes are so utterly inept you'll wonder about the mental abilities of the director, the dialog is a marvel of bad writing and even worse delivery. But the single best thing are the indescribably terrible sfx; in a world where CGI makes everything possible, its astonishing to see just what the makers of this film thought passed muster.

Seriously, this film had me in turns squealing with laughter or cringing so hard I thought my skin was going to come off. I can't wait to see it again!",1437436800,2,932,4.541666666666667

Movies are meant to be entertaining and this film succeeds at entertaining the audience! Going into it with the eyes and ears of a child may well be the best advice that I can give to the viewers of this film!
Having read many HORRIBLE reviews about this film, I almost didn't watch this movie. However, I'm glad I allowed myself the opportunity to decide for myself! If you want to see horrible creature features, check out EVERYTHING that the sci-fi network produces and then CRITICIZE a big budget cheesefest like this one and call it horrible!
Sure, this film has it's flaws! It has MANY, in fact! But, to me, this movie doesn't rank as one of the WORST films of all times!
That statement is a load of CRAP!
This is a DISASTER film about an african killer bee invasion in the United States. This follows the conventions of the disaster film, with it's long list of veteran actors, long running time and it stretches the limits of believability! But the film is entertaining and I've seen  A LOT worse!

Yes well, at least Fonda had the great good sense to show up late and to leave early (in repose).  We were stuck with Caine for the duration, playing a humorless sanctimonious nitwit with nary a smile for anyone.  I hope he was paid well for the humiliation.  What a drudge.  He looks as if he played the part under duress.  Was he blackmailed or just desperate for a role, any role, at any cost?  Whatever the excuse, Irwin Allen has given us a treasure trove of Oscar winning stars performing dreck like no one else could (or would).  It's an embarrassment of riches.  I don't think I'd be overstating it to say this is one of the worst films ever made.  It's like watching a train wreck.  I've watched it many times, thoroughly enjoying the mass destruction of so many careers.  (This was Fred MacMurray's last movie role.  How ignominious.)

It would be ludicrous to pick on the obvious plot problems, the sappy dialog, the stiff and stilted performances.  All are a given, considering the reputation of this movie.  The harder question to answer is why do so many people love this turkey (me included).  It is shamefully, woefully wrought.  But it's also stupidly enjoyable at the same time.  It helps that so many of the characters/actors are so portentously serious.  It's like they thought they were doing a public service announcement warning us of impending doom..........the bees are coming, the bees are coming!!!

484404,3,630258793X,"Well, it is an old movie without great special effects. They use enough puffed corn as bee stand-ins to feed everyone in Africa. But it's better than the worse cgi on ScFy.  Something has killed everyone on an army base.  No, it's not The Stand.  The special forces arrive to investigate and they find dead bodies and Michael Caine.  Or am I being redundant?  I just hope they paid him well for what was obviously a bore for him.  If you didn't know his age, you'd think he went to the Keanu Reeves single expression acting school.  Of course Michael knows what happened, but no one believes him and think he's a terrorist.  Until he drops the name of the President's science advisor who not only confirms who he is, but puts him in charge of this mess.  Of course, the military isn't happy like Pharrell, but they play along.  For now.  Then they discover a few other survivors.  Cue the perfect hair and makeup love interest.  It's a Bee convention! But despite the obvious signs (Bee stings all over dead bodies and survivors), no one believes the scientists. Well, the Bees have decided to have their convention in the woods, only to have a picnicing family crash the party.  The bees are none to happy about this development, so they take the law into their own hands and kill the couple.  But like Bob Marley, they didn't kill the deputy. Or, in this case, the annoying kid.  The kid who is so traumatized by seeing his parents killed that he is able to drive miles into the nearest town and instead of simply parking the car, crash it.  The kid survives, but like the girl in THEM (who's a much better actress in a much better movie), he can't articulate what happened until Michael Caine ambles along to convince him that a giant bee isn't real.  While all this is going on, Fred McMurry (sans his 3 sons & Uncle Charley) and another guy are vying for the charms of the elderly school principle.  They both propose and she puts them off.  I don't recall if that triangle was ever resolved.  But the bees are on the move to this town.  By the time Michael Caine and the future Mrs. Caine figure out what the bees are doing, the bees attack the town. I guess the bees figure that since humans messed up their convention, they would mess up the town's celebration.  And complete it by killing a bunch of school kids, who just couldn't make it back inside the school.  See what happens when you eliminate Phs Ed?  The military wants a quick solution, but head honcho Michael is thwarting everything they want to try.  Even though with all the resources and people he's been given, hasn't come up with a single idea of what to do.  But he is good at saying ""NO"".  Well, the bees are on their way to Houston and the military has wrested control from Michael and decide to try poision bee food. Which doesn't work, because as we all know from these movies, only the scientists can have the solution after thousands have died.  Do they come up with the right answer?  Is Houston saved?  Do they bees complete their convention? Does Michael Caine hook up with the love interest?  Does Michael Caine's expression ever change?  Which proposal does the school principle decide to take?  These burning questions and more may or may not be answered in THE SWARM.  If you could watch Sharknado, you can watch this.",1407542400,3,3307,4.491610738255034

Ed Wood eat your heart out!!

Why do people call ""The Swarm"" a disaster? I mean, it *is* a disaster movie, right? The corny plot revolves around Texas being invaded by vicious killer bees. Not content with killing peaceful Texans on picnic, they derail trains, make a nuclear power plant explode and wipe out several towns in gruesome fashion. Eventually, the bugs are lured out to sea, where they are incinerated en masse in a dramatic finale. What more can you ask for, LOL.

""The Swarm"" is also fascinating - if that's the right word for it - as cultural studies. Is it really about killer bees? Or is the lethal insect simply a metaphor for something else entirely? The film ends with the following bizarre statement: ""The African killer bee portrayed in this film bears absolutely no relationship to the industrious, hard-working American honey bee to which we are indebted for pollinating vital crops that feed our nation."" I'm not the only person who suspects that ""African killer bee"" means ""Blacks, Hispanics and illegal aliens"". Not to mention Communists.

If anything, this subconscious racism is the real disaster!

On a deeper level, I think modern Westerners consider killer bees to be a scandal. Honeybees are supposed to be our docile servants, ""hard-working"" and ""industrious"" in their unselfish service to Western civilization. Yet, here comes a bee that aggressively defends its honey, kills intruders and couldn't care less about feeding our nation. Small wonder people are upset. Especially if the pesky bug turns out to come from sub-Saharan Africa, that liminal zone beyond proper civilization and decorum...

And then you've got ""The Swarm"" (1978), which along with ""Meteor"" (1979) and ""When Time Ran Out"" (1980) closed the door on the disaster craze for a while, and with good reason.  ""The Swarm"", though quite earnest in its theme, is probably about as bad as it gets for a movie regardless of genre.  That's what makes it so fun to watch.  Ostensibly, the stars of this movie are Africanized killer bees - millions of them that invade a US Air Force missile complex, terrorize a small town in the middle of its annual flower festival, then set their sights on the metropolis of Houston.

It's up to Michael Caine, who plays a bee expert, to try to figure out how to lure these bees away so that people can live in peace again.  But if left up to a hard-nosed air force general played by Richard Widmark, and his right-hand man (Bradford Dillman), half the United States might get wiped out getting rid of the bees.  Katharine Ross is on hand as an air force doctor who ends up getting stung by bees, and Henry Fonda does his best as an aging bee expert to try to find an antidote to their stings.

Of all the scenes in the movie, perhaps the funniest occurs when Richard Chamberlain, as one of Caine's peers, and Jose Ferrer, as the manager of a nuclear power plant not too far from Houston, die when bees overrun the plant and cause it to explode.  It marked the second time that the late great Irwin Allen killed off a Chamberlain character - he did it to Chamberlain in ""The Towering Inferno"" - but this time, he took over 36,000 other people with him!

Also cranking up the cheese-meter is the ending, after which the producers thank the industrious and docile American honeybee for its contributions to our society.

The Swarm was the nadir of Irwin Allen's career, a film so bad, that lost so much money, he forbade those around him to ever speak of it again. It's pretty easy to see why. Long considered one of the worst disaster movies ever made, and rightly so.

Plot? There's a plot? Okay, here you go: a swarm of killer bees is attacking America, and the army, along with the somewhat-coerced help of Dr. Bradford Crane (Michael Caine), has to figure out how to stop it. As time goes on, things get outrageous, pulling in every subconscious fear the scriptwriters could throw in (the bees attacking a nuclear plant is a piece of moronic genius).

Despite the movie having a rather large number of stars, the acting is godawful from front to back. Caine might as well have been dead. No one else in here manages to even come close to that. Katherine Ross is wooden. Fred MacMurray and Bradford Dillman, as rival suitors for the hand of the town schoolteacher (Olivia DeHavilland, who might as well be made of clay) inject some much-needed humor into the movie, but it isn't nearly enough. The love-story subplot between Caine and Katharine Ross is preposterous both as a plot point and for the utter lack of chemistry between the two. And those are the high points.

Disaster movie? It's a disaster of a movie. Probably worthwhile for playing drinking games with, otherwise can be safely avoided. *",1216339200,,1417,4.656

And, yes the cast of All-Stars & B-list actors did deserve a better script from Stirling Siliphant, the great writer of televsion shows such as the calssic Route 66, and Irwin Allen's first two disaster epics.

However, I actually DID like Michael Caine's & Richard Widmark's performances. They made great ""friendly adversaries""...the civilian scientist & the ""warhawk"" Air Force general.

Even Gen Xers, who seemed attracted to watching really bad movies and TV shows, would have a hard time enjoying this, in their terms, ""ironically"".

484519,2,630258793X,"There's delusion on an epic scale on display in Irwin Allen's infamous The Swarm. It's not the worst of his oeuvre by a long way - Beyond the Poseidon Adventure and When Time Ran Out are both much, much worse - but it's become the poster child for all the absurdities of the disaster genre at it's hokeyest. But then capsized ships with atom bombs aboard or volcanoes threatening hotel complexes can't compare to killer bees destroying nuclear power plants and causing train wrecks on the Richter Scale of movie absurdity. And it's a curiously second- and third-hand construction too - structurally Stirling Silliphant's script is surprisingly similar to his script for In the Heat of the Night. Okay, there weren't any bees in that one, but from the beginning where big city cop Sidney Poitier is discovered at a murder scene and immediately treated as a suspect by hard-case racist cop Rod Steiger until he gradually learns to respect his expertise, it's being used as a template, with sunflower seed munching entomologist Michael Caine discovered in a missile silo full of dead bodies by hard-case xenophobic general Richard Widmark, who immediately suspects him of their deaths until he gradually learns to respect his expertise (how can you not love a film where Bradford Dillman asks ""Can we count on a scientist who prays?"" only for Widmark to respond ""I wouldn't count on one that didn't""?).

But this isn't a film about trust or even narrative, it's about miscast and affordable stars getting stung to death in slow-motion by what look like bits of oatmeal painted black and fired at them by air-cannons. It's a film about hallucinating patients being menaced by imaginary giant bees. It's a film about military complexes with lots of flashing lights. It's a film about bad acting in the face of insurmountably inane dialogue (""Are you endowing these bees with human motives? Like saving their fellow bees from captivity, or seeking revenge on Mankind?"" ""I always credit my enemy, no matter what he may be, with equal intelligence."" and ""Billions of dollars have been spent to make these nuclear plants safe. Fail-safe! The odds against anything going wrong are astronomical, Doctor!"" ""I appreciate that, Doctor. But let me ask you. In all your fail-safe techniques, is there a provision for an attack by killer bees?"" are just the tip of the iceberg). It's about bad fashion sense - this being the 70s, the decade that taste forgot, amid a preponderance of trouser flairs there are a lot of earth tones and oranges amid the costumes, so it's entirely possible that the bees simply mistook the actors for flowers waiting to be pollinated. And it's all done with a gloriously straight face and even, on a few rare occasions, some technical competence - Irwin Allen may have loved schmaltz, but he had a great visual sense when dealing with military hardware and there are some genuinely impressive shots in the picture when he gets to play with the toys. Unfortunately his handling of the actors is much more mechanical, with the old guard (Widmark, Olivia DeHavilland, Henry Fonda, Ben Johnson) faring better than poor old Caine and Katherine Ross. And, like many bad films, it's topped off by a superb score, one of Jerry Goldsmith's very best from his golden period. Much more fun than it's good to admit, the proposed remake has a lot to live up to.

Warners' DVD is pretty good - the extended two-and-a-half hour cut in 2.35:1 widescreen from the old laserdisc release with a 1978 22-minute TV featurette on the making of the film plus the original trailer - but the sound, while acceptable, lacks much range.",1159747200,27,3622,4.86871961102107

He's the only good thing in this miserable dreck. Don't get me wrong - he's over acting, but he isn't chewing up the scenery like so many others in this long, drawn out pot boiler/action film.

Irwin Allen produced The Swarm. He also created ""The Towering Inferno,"" ""Earthquake,"" and ""The Posiedon Adventure"" among a vast list of low grade science fiction/action television series. Allen used a formula for each of his films/television series. He doesn't stray from it here.

Michael Caine is at his most painfully horrible, overacting so badly he verges on a manic personality. Olivia DeHaviland embarrasses herself with a god-awful southern accent and overacts so badly she seems to be doing a skit impression of herself for an acting class on how NOT to act. Fred McMurray is saddled with dismal dialogue but doesn't actually embarrass himself.

Allen throws us a bevy of A-List actors from the silver screen era, only to squander and waste them. The script is absolutely painfully bad. Nothing quite makes sense (not that this silliness could ever really make sense.

Apparently, swarms of African Killer Bees has been sitting around procreating and mustering up the nerve to declare war on all of Texas (although only an idiot would not realize that the sets used are in the Hollywood Hills and backlots everywhere in Hollywood). What if these swarms were to get together and create one huge swarm? What indeed?!

The opening of the film: a large group of men in orange mechanics overalls and orange motorcycle helmets wander around a military facility without uttering a word - this takes place over about twenty minutes. Apparently we are to understand that these boys in orange are the scientists and military personnel assigned to investigate a disaster: the military installation has been decimated by something....but what? The lab is quite obviously from Allen's television series: 20000 Leagues Under the Sea and Lost in Space. When they do speak, you wish they just shut up instead of uttering such drivel.

Now, we are to believe that these bees kill quickly and efficiently leaving no tell tale signs of what killed the victims. First of all there would be huge welts on the victims and secondly there would be some dead bees (they tell us they've only discovered one bee carcass - I got news for you - if I'm getting stung by a swarm of bees, I'm still going to get in a few good slaps and take out more than zero bees).

Christian Juttner's character is part of the first onscreen attack. His parents are killed as they set up for a picnic (thank heavens, because neither of them can act)- Juttner is mercifully spared because he was sent to the car for a thermos...

He drives the car(covered in bees) into the backlot...um, I mean the nearby town and is whisked off to a hospital for treatment of his bites.  He later sneaks out with some friends and antagonizes the swarm of bees in the picnic area where his parents died. Then he runs around talking to Michael Caine and promises to watch over some woman Caine has taken a liking to. Next we see Juttner in bed in the hospital sick, dying, dead! Wow! Where did this come from?

deHavilland agonizes as only a high school freshman acting student would over the deaths of dozens of school children in the playground (however never do we actually see a bee on any of these kids).

No where in the film do we see any indication that bees have actually stung any victims. There are no welts, no marks, no redness. They're just .... dead. (I've actually been attacked by a hive full of hornets....let me tell you - they leave huge welts on you - all red, sore and painful).

This film is great if you want really bad cinema. It is not even remotely good though.

Please run ...and run quickly from ....The Swarm!",1124064000,3,3937,4.688405797101449
484551,2,630258793X,"""The Swarm"" (1978) was a box-office disaster when it was originally released.  And no wonder, what with its bottom-of-the-barrel special effects, absolutely horrible, illogical script by Stirling Silliphant and direction by Irwin Allen that shows none of the professionalism or pacing of his best films--namely, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and ""The Towering Inferno.""  What's more, in its original, 115-minute form, it appears to have been edited by a meat cleaver and jumps from one calamity to another with such abruptness that after a while everything becomes laughable.  Yet, I actually have a certain fondness for the thing, especially in its expanded, 156-minute DVD version, which is actually an improvement, basically since it is better paced and the characters and situations prove more tolerable.  Yes, it is still a horrible film, but also oddly entertaining, much like watching William Hung on ""American Idol.""  You know it stinks but you're fascinated anyway.

The film plays on '70's paranoia in its depiction of an invasion of the desert southwest by a huge swarm of bees.  The cast is large and full of disaster movie veterans and legendary big-screen hasbeens, most of whom show up just long enough to be killed by the bees.  Actually, the film is best-known for featuring Michael Caine, in one of two consecutive screen megabombs (the other being ""Beyond the Poseidon Adventure"") which would have killed any other career; fortunately, he survived the debacles and went on to win two Oscars and become one of our greatest screen actors.  His main support comes from Katharine Ross and Richard Widmark, whose careers unfortunately did not recover.  The rest of the cast shall remain nameless, since the surviving players are probably still embarassed by their performances, which usually end with their characters attacked by bees, flailing their arms and screaming in slow motion before falling to the ground.  At least those are the lucky ones.  Others are blown up in train crashes or nuclear power plants, which are illogically overpowered by the bees, which resemble those little chocolate sprinkles you put on ice cream.

The plot?  Are you kidding?  The United States is invaded by killer bees from Africa.  People die.  Whole towns are lost.  Houston is evacuated.  The entire cast dies, except Caine and Ross, who evidently are immune to the bees since they manage to escape Houston by simply putting a towel over their heads while everyone else dies.  All of this directed with incredible incompetence by Irwin Allen, who managed to make ""The Towering Inferno"" look like ""Titanic"" in comparison.

There's no use discussing the cast since everyone is simply picking up a paycheck.  Michael Caine once said he made the film so he could build a house and he ended up with a lousy film and a beautiful house.  Judging by the jokes he's endured for this atrocity, the ""Poseidon"" sequel, and especially, ""Jaws the Revenge,"" he earned the house.  Luckily for the viewer, the ineptitude is actually entertaining at times, and funnier than most of today's so-called comedies, so who can begrudge him?

Incidentally, this film was scored by the great, incomparable composer Jerry Goldsmith, who passed away last week.  Tellingly, ""The Swarm"" was not mentioned when the highlights of his career were discussed.  I wonder why?

In all, ""The Swarm"" is horrible.  So horrible, in fact, it is entertaining.  Now, as for ""Beyond the Poseidon Adventure""---

** (out of *****), simply because it's so damned funny.  And if you care?  Panavision widescreen, with no other features.  My opinion?  Raquel Welch did a commentary track to ""Myra Breckinridge"" which was eons better than the film.  What about it, Mike?  Ready to buy a new house?",1093651200,6,3744,5.098684210526316
484552,5,630258793X,"Michael Caine said he made this movie because he wanted to buy a house and needed the money, and even though moviegoers might hate the movie, he's sure they'd have loved the house.

484553,5,630258793X,"Remember the days of Irwin Allen? During the 1970s, this director ruled Hollywood with several all-star, action packed disaster films. There was ""The Towering Inferno"" with Paul Newman and Steve McQueen. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" with Gene Hackman and Shelley Winters. The only one he wasn't associated with, I think, was ""Earthquake"" with Charlton Heston and George Kennedy. A cast of stars both major and minor populated constellation Irwin Allen. He could do no wrong-his films weren't masterpieces of cinematic art, but they drew in audiences willing to spend money to watch these epics. Then Allen made ""The Swarm,"" and a horribly swift silence descended over Hollywood. The 1978 film about a pack of civilization threatening killer bees should receive cult classic status from lovers of crud cinema. Where else are you going to see Henry Fonda inject himself with bee venom? Or Richard Widmark going down for the count while trying to stave off bees with a flamethrower? Say what you will about this film, and you could say plenty of terrible things about it, but it definitely falls under the ""so bad it's good"" category and thus deserves are attention.
Something's amiss at a missile silo somewhere in Texas. The military sends in a crack team of orange suited soldiers to discover what went wrong. It turns out a swarm of killer bees attacked the installation and killed all the personnel. General Slater (Widmark) arrives on the scene to supervise only to find Dr. Brad Crane (Michael Caine) strolling around the silo. Crane claims a swarm of deadly bees did the damage, a statement confirmed by a radar operator noticing something moving away at seven (!) miles an hour. A chopper sent up crashes when the bees attack (!!). Once the military defines the problem, Crane receives the go ahead from the president to take charge of the situation. He brings in all sorts of specialists, including world-renowned immunologist Dr. Krim (Henry Fonda) and the cranky Dr. Hubbard (Richard Chamberlain). Crane ramps up the hysteria by claiming that the bees will attack anyone in sight, including population centers. Sure enough, the focus jumps to a family picnic where we see Mom and Dad collapse under the weight of a thousand bee stings. Back at central control, Crane and Krim discover that a single bee sting is enough to kill a human being.
The situation rapidly deteriorates. The bees swarm through a town, ravaging the locals at will. A train full of evacuees derails as the killer insects attack with abandon. Hundreds die as Crane and an Air Force officer named Helena Anderson (Katharine Ross) try to find a solution out in the field. More problems emerge as the bees wipe out a nuclear power plant run by Dr. Andrews (Jose Ferrar) before moving on to Houston. Every solution the military attempts fails, including an effort to use flamethrowers to burn the bees out of the city. As Houston burns in the background, as ambulances crash through windows and blow up with the force of atomic bombs, Slater worries whether history will condemn him to the ash heap for what he has done. Crane offers one final idea, an idea that, if it works, could finally destroy the swarm once and for all. Barely escaping from the flaming wreck that is Houston, Crane and Anderson execute an intricate plot involving sound and helicopters. Fortunately, science again triumphs over the evil forces of nature. And not a moment too soon, I say.
Nothing works in ""The Swarm."" Plot holes abound, so many that it is impossible to mention them all here. How did the bees get into an underground bunker and back out again without leaving any trace of their passing? If the swarm is such a threat, how come only one immunologist is working on finding a cure? Could bees really cause a train to derail? Questions without answers will constantly sidetrack your attention as you watch this film. Moreover, the performances from big name stars achieve a level of ridiculousness that is simply delicious to watch. Caine sleepwalks as Brad Crane, Ross looks like she's in a coma, and Widmark chews scenery without a thought to his future career. Allen throws in a bunch of ineffective and clichd subplots, including a three way geriatric love triangle between Olivia de Havilland, Fred MacMurray, and Ben Johnson that ends in tragedy. Then there's the obligatory pregnant lady about to give birth (Patty Duke), and the altruistic self-sacrifice of Dr. Krim. Fonda's melodramatic final minutes are a marvel of hammy acting. Best line here? His vital signs are ""swinging from the norm to really spooky levels."" Another personal favorite occurred when de Havilland's character, a school principal, witnesses a bunch of kids falling prey to the bees outside a building. She utters a hilarious groan of agony as she turns away from the window in horror. The movie, for some reason, shows this in slow motion. Are we supposed to be laughing this hard, Mr. Allen?
I could go on and on and on again about the hammy and ridiculous levels ""The Swarm"" achieves during its nearly three-hour runtime. I loved every minute of it, and am thinking about buying a copy of the film soon so I can roar with derision at my leisure. Sadly, the DVD doesn't have a lot in the way of extras. There is a short television style documentary about some of the stunt work in the film that in its own right is hilarious. You get to see Henry Fonda earnestly lecture the public on the real threat of killer bees, thereby implying that the over the top stuff in the movie could ""really happen."" Pshaw, Henry! You ought to know better than that. Of course, I should have known better than to try and take this film seriously. A comedy classic!",1086307200,2,5688,4.828893442622951

484557,3,630258793X,"THE SWARM

(USA - 1978)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)
Theatrical soundtrack: 4-track stereo

Contrary to popular opinion, THE SWARM (1978) is not the worst movie ever made. Anyone who says otherwise clearly hasn't seen the collected works of Jesus Franco or Andy Milligan. Or Woody Allen (only kidding!).

Having exhausted the possibilities of the one-disaster-in-a-single-film subgenre (THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, THE TOWERING INFERNO, FIRE!, FLOOD, etc.), producer-director Irwin Allen hired screenwriter Stirling Silliphant (IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT) to conceive a storyline in which several catastrophes occur within a broader narrative. Taking his cue from previous small-scale entries like THE DEADLY BEES (1966) and TERROR OUT OF THE SKY (1978), Silliphant concocted THE SWARM, an old-fashioned monster movie with an all-star cast, in which a huge mass of African killer bees rampage across America's south-west before descending on Houston, destroying everything in their path - including towns, trains, nuclear power plants, and the reputations of numerous high-profile actors.

Representing the last gasp of the disaster cycle inaugurated in 1969 by Ross Hunter's big-time adaptation of Arthur Hailey's AIRPORT and popularized by Allen with respectable entries like the aforementioned POSEIDON and TOWERING (the latter a bona fide masterpiece), THE SWARM encapsulates this director's basic commercial ethos: Big stars, big set-pieces, and big drama. But Silliphant's script is so hokey in places, it's difficult to believe the writer wasn't deliberately mocking the entire scenario: Michael Caine is so obviously miscast (as a 'brilliant' entomologist), and so clearly contemptuous of the material, his expression never changes throughout the entire film, though Richard Widmark (whose career enjoyed a brief renaissance during the 1970's) gives it everything he's got as a gruff military type who's eager to quell the threat by bombing everything in sight. Henry Fonda rises above the fray as a dedicated immunologist, and Slim Pickens is quietly dignified in a brief appearance as a bereaved father, while Olivia De Havilland forms the centerpiece of a gentle romantic subplot (she's courted by Fred MacMurray and Ben Johnson). Richard Chamberlain, Lee Grant, Jose Ferrer, Bradford Dillman and Patty Duke Astin are featured in supporting roles alongside leading lady Katharine Ross, who seems particularly embarrassed by her ridiculous dialogue (get a load of her hysterical reaction to the death of a sympathetic younger character - if you lean forward, you can almost smell the ham!).

Unfortunately, the home video version runs 155 minutes in length (expanded from the 116m theatrical print), which pads the narrative with pointless dialogue exchanges and routine soap opera melodramatics, turning a tightly constructed disaster thriller into an endless yak-fest. Whereas the theatrical print moved along at a fair old clip, this version slows everything down to a mild saunter, punctuated by a number of flamboyant visual fireworks. Allen stages the action sequences with a good deal of cinematic flair (despite poor photographic effects by industry veteran L.B. Abbott), but the movie's entertainment value is seriously compromised by needless padding.",1035763200,3,3271,5.678936605316974
