Oh wait, did I mention amazon's horrible video quality, which wouldn't even play on my PS3, so I ended up watching this on my laptop.  btw, my bandwidth is through the roof, and all other video streaming is smooth and HD.

Back to the movie.  Great acting, great initial story, very entertaining...  and them pow... it is over.  I'm talking about a 5 minute wrap up that doesn't even start to do anything with the current story.  There are so many ideas and subplots here that are started without finishing.  I'd strongly advise watching the last 10 minutes before investing in the whole film.  You will lose nothing in relevant spoilers and prob save yourself from wanting to watch the rest of the movie.",1383264000,3,837,4.678082191780822
8450222,4,B004ZKNBKM,"[BLOOD CURSE -(2006)- Widescreen - Portugese with English subtitles] Now that Palisades has taken over Tartan films, they're re-releasing several older Tartan films under different titles, like 'Root of Evil', which is actually 'Acacia', a solid artsy horror film from several years ago, 'The Hillside Strangler' now retitled 'The Hillside Stranglings', 'Carved' currently retitled 'Slit-mouthed Woman' and this film, only in this instance the title was left intact, but declaring they are all from 2011 is deceptive and confusing nonetheless. The absence of details on Amazon makes for further ambiguity, which I'll attempt to clarify, as I did with the languages listed above.

An affluent urban family inherits a large house in Portugal's countryside. None of the father's siblings wanted the place, and his well-worn weariness of his current life leads him to believe that this change of scenery will do his family good. His wife is supportive (possibly too much so), his daughter has recently had a child out of wedlock, his older son is going through that rebellious stage all young bucks go through, and his youngest child is a bit 'off', possibly. So the decision's made to take the plunge and see what happens. Luckily for us, something does.

As the family attempts to adjust to rural life, dark rumors circulate throughout the village that their house is haunted, magnified by their housekeeper's old world beliefs in magic, potions and prayer. The local priest is comforting and amiable, but comes off as disingenuous. He must contend with both past and present sense of religious dogma peppered with old world magic and superstition. But there is something about his relationship with the wife that's not all koscher, and when the eldest son comes to visit, things become more darkly exaggerated and sinister.

Atmospheric and intelligent, the film never descends into garish horror cliches with possessions, body counts, bloodshed, pea soup spoutings or strolls on the ceiling. Subtlety is ever-present, yet it holds interest (it did mine) in spite of the obvious conventions of the genre being ignored. That's not to say it's entirely original; quite the contrary, all of these elements have appeared in many films prior to this, but the acting, directing and the unique soundtrack seem to lend fresh life to a genre that's almost impossible to insert anything worthwhile or new into. It's not a great flick, but it is a good one for fans of films like 'The Haunting', 'The Innocents', 'Eye of the Devil', 'The Other', 'The Wicker Man', etc.",1320969600,4,2556,5.124700239808154
