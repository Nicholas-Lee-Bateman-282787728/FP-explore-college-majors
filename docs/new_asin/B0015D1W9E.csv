8258024,5,B0015D1W9E,"Far from the mega $$ of Hollywood movies, Tropa de Elite delivers raw and intense action till the very end. The learning curve is brutal as we see who you can/can not trust is the status quo of the city. Definitely a must-see film if you wish to see a cop film made without unbreakable american heroes.",1280275200,,302,4.315789473684211
8258025,5,B0015D1W9E,"I never knew what the Bope was all about, now I know something from watching this great movie.  Wagner Moura has a great role in this movie and it is quite intense.  Great price and good movie to have, especially if you've never been to Brazil and want to see what life is like outside of tourism.",1256256000,,297,4.192982456140351

8258027,5,B0015D1W9E,"Wow, what a great movie! Let me first say that I am extremely picky about movies and have found myself watching fewer and fewer as time goes by, mostly because most movies now seem to be boring and pointless. So when I do, on a rare occassion, enjoy a movie, for me it is unusual. I didn't just enjoy this movie though, I loved it. In fact, I did that rarest of things I watched it twice!

This movie focuses on the efforts of an elite Brazilian police unit in Rio and their efforts to reduce drug-related crimes. It is violent, compelling, entertaining and a first-class movie experience. Why? Because this movie avoids all the stereotypes of other cops versus drug-dealer movies, especially the simplified good guys vs. bad guys Hollywood take. It is also surprising and rewarding to see the drug war through the eyes of Brazilian culture as opposed to an American view.

The movie focuses on two young policemen, their experiences in the corrupt local police force, and their progression into joining the ranks of BOPE, the ""Elite Squad"" of the movie title. It is narrated by Captain Nascimento, the leader of a BOPE squad who is desperately trying to find a replacement for himself because after ten years in BOPE the stress and tension is causing him severe physical reactions, and he longs to spend time with his wife and newly born son.

This movie is AWESOME for two reasons I believe. One is that the voice of Nascimento is compelling and beautifully haunting; just listening to him speak in Portuguese as the movie plays will send shivers and chills through your body. Do not ever, ever, get a dubbed version of this movie, it would destroy the magic here. The second reason is that the movie is so highly realistic. All the characters are complex, three-dimensional, believable human beings, and their actions, reactions, and motivations are all perfectly in sync with their characters. There are no wrong, silly, or false notes played in this movie, it all rings true. The drug-dealers (trafficants) and believable, the corrupt police force is ultra-believable because the movie shows why they are corrupt, and the BOPE officers, shown through Nascimento, are completely believable as they struggle against both their corrupt peers and the desperate trafficants. This is no silly, Hollywood shoot 'em up, this is the real deal and it is my favorite movie this year. It's going into my top ten movies ever list.",1224374400,2,2422,4.831325301204819
8258028,5,B0015D1W9E,"This film literally will leave you open-mouthed. Its absorbing and engaging script deals with the horrid reality that happens in ""Las favelas"", humble and miserable homes of the poor people that work out as a real ""misery belt"" around Rio de Janeiro, and the existence of an Elite squad that works out as the underground tentacle of the law. Their tactics are very similar to Swat. ""Elite Squad"" is by far, the most explosive, forceful and extraordinary Brazilian film emerged from Brazil in this raising Century. Its frenetic rhythm, dynamic structure and kaleidoscopic secondary plots couldn't be better handled. With secure hand, this compelling film deals with this police corps and its corrupt structure that basically infects all the hierarchic statements. Behind the official procedures in order to maintain the zone in well safety due the imminent visit of the Pope (it's April 1997), there's a sharp inner conflict in one of the most relevant officers, brilliant but tired if that dangerous activity. He will have to find a worthy substitute.

These are the two main dramatic ties, but along the way there's an acid gaze about the bitter conflict of interests and privileges. The corruption nestles everywhere you look and nothing changes for the health of the nasty order. Everybody acts according the rules to live and survive, and through the lives of several members of the squad, we get inside this underworld of unthinkable tricks and greed where a wrong move may cause your unstoppable wreck.

The style of cinema verite is used from start to finish, the nervous camera shows us the ambushes, betrayal and emotive disaffections that cohabit together in the heights of Rio.

A brave, bold and overwhelming film that with deserved reason literally have made the most of critics (specially in Europe had had such resonance and so many success.

By any reason you should miss it.",1219449600,,1891,5.031948881789138
8258029,5,B0015D1W9E,"This movie is one of the most REAL i have ever seen , it gives you a real idea about life in a city like Rio de Janeiro and a very close look on the "" FAVELA "" * a place were the goverment has no control or autority

Esse filme  simplesmente o mais REAL que eu ja vi , ele mostra a ideia real da vida numa cidade como o Rio de Janeiro e um viso bem exata e proxima nas favelas * um lugar onde o governo no tem nenhum controle ou autoridade",1213488000,,439,3.610526315789474
8258030,5,B0015D1W9E,"This is, in may opinion, one of the best movies of the year. It's a more realistic and powerful movie when compared to other movies of the same genre. It's like ""SWAT"" without all the Hollywood fables.  Wagner Moura gives an Oscar like performance. It's a must see for anyone who loves action  movies.",1208217600,6,301,4.555555555555555
8258031,5,B0015D1W9E,"or something roughly translated to that effect is the motto of BOPE, The Brazilian special operations police outfit.

The story 'Tropa De Elite' tells the story of Captain Nascimiento, a captain in a BOPE squad, who because of personal and family issues wishes to relinquish his command and is in search of a worthy successor for his job. The story is a parallel to the life of 2 close friends, Neto and Matias, young and idealistic who join up with the regular police force and quickly learn the murky truth behind the corruption and extent to which it has permeated to the entire echelons of the police force. Frustrated with their role at being mere facilitators of this level of corrupt activities, they decide to take charge and do some good for the society as well as the police force.
I will not get into the specific details for the sake of sounding like a spolier, but during the course of this they come into contact with Captain Nascimiento during a hostile interaction with drug dealers from the favelas and they sign up for BOPE.
The rest of the movie revolves around the completely different personalities of Neto and Matias and how the Captain must decide who has more courage, integrity and dedication among the two friends, for the job of a BOPE captain.

One of the most intense scenes in the movie, is the course of the BOPE training that Neto and Matias have to endure.

Additonally, It also deals in a very humane manner as to the pressures the people in BOPE face and thei families as well, much to the romanticism of the whole concept, their lives are equally under a great deal of stress and issues.
But it conveys a very brutal and realistic truth, as to who actually encourages drugs and their sales and the inevitable violence that accompanies it. In the end, it is the very people that use drugs are the ones who encourage (both indirectly and directly) the whole crime in society, by and large

Its a very powerful and remarkable film, this is going to be a must buy in my collection when it becomes available. I would definitely recommend for you to see it.",1206403200,16,2087,4.572192513368984
8258032,5,B0015D1W9E,"Tropa de Elite (Elite Squad) shows us the day of a member of BOPE, a urban task force existent in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Inspired by the book 'Elite da Tropa' written by a former Captain of this task force (Capito Nascimento), Tropa de Elite will give you the inside look on a 'favela', the training of BOPE, their personal problems and, even with all the bad things and the danger of being a member of BOPE, the desire and strength shown by young people who believe in good.

This is definitely, a 5 star movie.",1205366400,11,514,4.34375
