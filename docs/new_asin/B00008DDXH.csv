1837102,5,B00008DDXH,"The Campion Series is well written and well made. No Spoiliers. Mystery Mile is a really good english mystery. Peter Davidson is great as Campion. The story is really good based on the novel by Margery Allingham the creator  of Campion.
This Series is a most for mystery fans!",1283385600,,276,4.63265306122449
1837103,5,B00008DDXH,"No Spoilers, this a really good mstery series well written and acted. I am a Peter Davidson and really enjoy his protrayal of Albert Campion. Ian Ogilvy is excellent as a song and dance man. the story is very enjoyable to watch. If you love a good mystery you will not be disappionted.",1279756800,,285,4.39622641509434
1837104,5,B00008DDXH,"Once again, BBC outdoes its self with adapting books to TV. This time it is with a Margery Allingham mystery, Camion. Screenplay by Jill Hyem.

Peter Davison as Albert Campion and his faithful companion Brian Glover as Magersfontein Lugg are so good in this 1989 TV series that even when you read the book you think of them. I have to admit that I have not read this book yet.

Campion receives a mysterious letter from ""The Mole"" it tells him of a school acquaintance (nicknamed Piggy) that just passed away. Campion go to the funeral and there hears a snorting sound that piggy used to make clearing his throat (thus the nickname). We get close up views of characters that are suspect. Campion thinks little of this until three months late with it looks like piggy died again.

Is Piggy really dead this time or did we hear another snort? Moreover, what is this all about?

1837105,5,B00008DDXH,"EXCELLENT MYSTERY, SUSPENSE DVD. I WISH WHOEVER PRODUCED THIS SERIES WOULD BRING IT BACK. NO DUMB COP, INTELLIGENT DIALOGUE, AND VERY, VERY ENTERTAINING.",1259020800,2,153,5.695652173913044
1837106,4,B00008DDXH,"In addition to the annotated biography and filmography (presented as text/lists), the Special Features on the disc includes a wonderful featurette, on the order of 'the making of...'  The introduction to the 25 minute item, is this card:  ""'See For Yourself' is a BBC series that shows how the BBC puts license payer's money to use.  BBC is funded by a tax (called the license fee) on each television household in the UK.""  ""The following is an excerpt from an episode [of ""See For Yourself""] that originally aired in the UK on January 8, 1989.""  For years, I've been a fan of Inspector Lynley, and of Peter Davison in his newer series ""The Last Detective"" and I can almost believe the costs which are quoted in the featurette.  Do recall, that  the cost is quoted in the year 1989.  It is said that drama shows cost the most to produce, costing (in Pounds, Sterling) 408,000 per hour (i.e. 6,800 per minute).  <Gee, I thought the costs for buying our own copies of the discs, was helping in a tiny way to pay back the production costs.  Well maybe so, but in a way even smaller than an eyedropper against an ocean.>  I will happily continue to enjoy all the recordings which I am able to put into hand.",1226620800,,1203,4.472477064220183
1837107,5,B00008DDXH,"""Alber Campion, born may the 20th, 1900. Name known to be a pseudonym. Education: priviledged. Embarked on an adventurous career 1929. Coups neatly executed. Nothing sordid. Deserving cases preferred. Police no object.""
This movie is great! Peter Davison is EXCELLENT as Mr. Albert Campion(!) and Brian Glover as Lugg! I can't imagine anyone doing better than they did unless the characters themselves stepped from the book! (high praise from a book fanatic that has quite high standards).

I have watched this movie over and over, and love it.
A few deviences from the book (but compared to the massacres that I have seen of almost every other book made into a movie, it's quite forgivable), and my favorite line was missing, but quite, quite, forgivable, as the acting of Peter Davison and Brian Glover as their charaters is Magnificent. On, Campion, On!",1226361600,4,856,5.028169014084507
1837108,4,B00008DDXH,"I enjoyed this movie, but if you don't like English mysteries this wouldn't be your cup of tea. I like the characters the best.",1201392000,,127,4.333333333333333
1837109,3,B00008DDXH,"I thought this was kind of boring at the beginning.  The art theme just didn't grab me.  I think it got more interesting towards the end, but it was a while ago that I watched this (borrowed it from the library).  Well, I guess there's probably a boring episode or two in every series; we can't love all of them.  I own the complete second season of Campion and I enjoyed those episodes more.",1173657600,2,392,4.256756756756757
1837110,3,B00008DDXH,"Maybe I was having a little trouble focusing on the plot, but the beginning seemed a bit unrelated to the rest of the show. May have been because this is the first time I've watched one of the Campion episodes. After the real sleuthing started things got better though. Although not on par with other top notch period detective shows (Nero Wolfe takes the cake there for me, Foyle's War is another excellent one) this one was pretty entertaining. The clues are not all presented to the viewer, so your chances of solving the case along with Campion are not too good, but the conclusion made sense. Lugg (his butler?) is very entertaining as his 'assistant' as well. There are better shows out there, but this is not a bad one, I will rent some more :)",1131667200,3,751,4.489051094890511
1837111,5,B00008DDXH,"A really good adaptation of Margery Allingham's book, keeping well to the plot while minimising the personal mystery of her noble sleuth. Makes a very enjoyable entertainment. The whole series is worth watching if you like Christie / Allingham / Sayers type English mysteries.",1108857600,3,276,5.295454545454546
1837172,5,B00008DDXH,"Old, still enjoyable",1420502400,,20,6.0
1837173,5,B00008DDXH,"My wife and I have been working our way through the Campion series, and we think this is far and away the best we've seen so far.  See my review of the book for more details.  It's nice to be able to watch a fully-developed murder mystery with an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old in the room.  Typically these days, we find ourselves either cringing before each scene, or, more often, just waiting until after bedtime.

Oh, and I failed to mention: We also are huge fans of Foyle's War. We liked it even more than Campion. So this is no knock on the reviewer, just a difference in taste.",1417996800,,583,4.321100917431193

I know I know --but now I have TWO ""look to the lady""  DVD's

1837177,5,B00008DDXH,"True to Margery Allingham's characters, Campion and his butler/sidekick, Lugg, solve another interesting mystery with their usual humor and style!",1376352000,,146,6.35
1837178,5,B00008DDXH,"Sweet Danger is one of those books I've read at least twenty times, and it's always a good read. Allingham's story is well-adapted here in the classic Peter Davison series. An impoverished family just barely getting by is desperate to prove a long-stagnant earldom is their family's. They join forces to keep this from getting into the hands of a robber baron, with thugs out to harm the children of the family. Lysette Anthony is absolutely wonderful as Amanda, Campion's new friend. The entire cast is a joy to watch, and it's just a good, old-fashioned adventure. The only thing I would say is that sometimes the sound is a little off, but otherwise, top-notch production. The best scene is when Campion and Amanda meet, but there are a lot of other gems - when he has to shove their 30 year old car into the barn; when the family visits the crazy doctor, and the neverending stream of currant buns shoved in Campion's face. I wish they'd have been able to continue the series so through Traitor's Purse, but oh well. Still, the best Campion episode made!",1362960000,2,1058,4.632978723404255

1837180,5,B00008DDXH,"The Case of the Late Pig is a DVD I've already watched about three times simply because of the well drawn characters and the humor.  The combination of humor and mystery truly makes this a good watch.  The acting is well done and the plot is interesting.  If you enjoy British mysteries, this is right up your alley.  I also like Poirot and Marple, so if those are your thing then I can say I think you'll like this as well.  The main actor also plays in a series called The Last Detective which you may also wish to check out.  I like it.  However, I like Campion better.  His sidekick Lug is the perfect man to emphasize the humor of any situation.",1349827200,,650,4.227642276422764

7981866,5,B00008DDXH,"Love these stories. They are a bit strange but they are wonderful. I fell in love with Mr. Campion more than 40 years ago, reading all of Margery Allingham's books. The films are just as terrific as the written word. My only regret is that they did not do all the Amanda stories. Peter Davison is Campion personified.",1480291200,,317,4.482758620689655
