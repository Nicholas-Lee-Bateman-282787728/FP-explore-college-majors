There are several cute snippets of different people talking about and showing off their cats. The cats featured are most often regular house cats rescued from the ASPCA, though one woman keeps an ocelot (which frankly didn't seem too happy with her).
People looking for a serious documentary of cat history, animal psychology, or cat breeds should look elsewhere...this is mostly an indulgence. The truly smitten cat lover will enjoy the film as brief entertainment, though, and I especially recommend it for viewing by families, for it is certainly funny.
A comment made by the late Roger Caras (former head of the ASPCA) near the beginning of the video sums up the mood of the film pretty well: ""Owning a cat is like an American tourist eating in a fancy restaurant in Paris.... you're going to be overcharged, you're going to insulted... but somehow to *you* it is worth it.""  And to me, it was.",1048723200,5,1000,4.847953216374269
