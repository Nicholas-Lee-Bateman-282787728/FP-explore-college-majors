7793119,5,0847415511,"I ordered copies of these VHS tapes (2 part video) to replace copies that my church had purchased back in 1995 when the videos came out.  The church's VHS tapes degraded to the point that they were no longer usable.  I went online at Amazon and found 2 vendors of the VHS tapes.  Somehow, I received copies from both vendors - one set from each vendor.  When they arrived (both arrived in half the time expected), I found the tapes to be in original plastic wrap packaging and cardboard cover.  When playing the tapes in our new VCR, the tapes played like they were newly manufactured!  This is a big bonus considering how old the tapes really are!  My church staff is very pleased to be able to continue showing these videos to our congregation!  I was also pleasantly surprised to find a gospel track in the packaging from one of the vendors that aligns it's beliefs with ours.  I will probably be ordering more materials from this vendor at some future time.  In case you haven't seen the video:  Elizabeth Elliot presents two topics, one in each video.  Tape 1 describes traditional 2-parent home and how to ""run"" the home from a traditional Biblical prospective (husband/wife traditional roles).  Tape 2 describes how to raise and discipline children using Biblical principles.  The video on child raising is excellent and shows what NOT to do as well as how to do the right things!",1307577600,,1387,4.654320987654321
