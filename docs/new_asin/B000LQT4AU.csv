2712955,2,B000LQT4AU,"I have Fibrmyalgia and I was hoping this DVD would help change the perspective that for some people this is an illness that despite our strong wills,intense effort and attempts at all different types of treatment, are left disabled and unable to engage in the workforce. I wanted people to be aware that this total diablement is not due to the fact that we didn't try as hard as he people with Fibro who can work and/or do make a significant recovery but is due to factors beyond our control and thus we deserve the same respect people who are paraplegic get(ie it's not our fault we don't recover)
Unfortunately, in my and my husbands opinion, Living With Fibromyalgia while trying to give much needed 'hope'to sufferers of this illness, may also give more ammunition to family/friends to continue to judge and pressure those with Fibro to try harder to get better and/or accuse them of being simply depressed if unable to do paid work(as look all those people on the DVD push through the limitations and can work). There was way too much focus on recovery when in reality many sufferers are left totally disabled regardless of years of treatment and intense effort on their part. Their should have been case studies of people who have not recovered and more detail into how damaging judging those suffering with this illness can be to give a more realistic balanced approach.
While I applaud any attempt to give hope of recovery to those with Fibromyalgia and equip them with tools to manage symptoms and possibly even assist recovery, which LWF does, I cannot recommend this DVD as the harm it may cause for some is simply too great.",1252886400,21,1636,4.70383275261324
2712956,5,B000LQT4AU,"This video is great not only for the person who suffers from fibromyalgia, it is super for showing to his or her friends and family.  It's common that others don't understand what's going on with those of us who have fibromyalgia because we look about the same.  I highly recommend this video.",1251676800,2,293,4.615384615384615
2712957,5,B000LQT4AU,"This DVD was extremely well done, and was especially useful in helping family members understand the challenges we face in coping with this very difficult illness.",1250899200,2,163,5.3076923076923075
2712958,5,B000LQT4AU,"This is a great addition to the educational materials for the fibromyalgia community.

I showed this film to a fibromyalgia support group and had an overwhelmingly positive response. Patients kept saying ""Yes, that's me,"" and their family members seemed to really connect with thes stories presented. There is something about seeing your story or your loved one's story on TV that brings so much credibility and understanding. A woman called the next day to say that her life had changed; her husband had gone to the screening and finally, after 10 years of a diagnosis, really believed her and was finally willing to get involved in her recovery.

There is a good balance between the harsh reality of life with a chronic pain illness and hope that there are ways to get your life back, all the while respecting that fibro does change your life and the lives of those around you for good. You can also really tell that this was made by someone who knows someone with fibromyaliga...there's a tenderness and a sense of family that really shines through.",1184803200,3,1052,4.806629834254144
2712959,4,B000LQT4AU,"When I first saw this I was so emotionally overwhelmed in such a postive way though! There were tears,laughter, and relief cause I felt like ""YES"" a film on this and people with it saying almost everything I go through and want to say as well to people who are not ""aware"" at all, or just ""don't"" want to be aware or educated about Fibromyalgia.

What I liked best was the variety of ages,genders and races of people that interviewed and shown that have fibromyalgia to break the stereo type that only women over 40 get fibro, and the visual aspect of the symptoms of fibro.  The realistic and positive outlook on living with it and showing people laying down on the bed and couch because their just so fatigued or in so much pain, it's all they can do. At the same time showing how strong in mind and their positive attitudes it shows that in spite of having fibromyalgia were survivors!!

I would recommend this to a friend and family members, etc.",1178150400,18,950,4.448275862068965
2712960,5,B000LQT4AU,"This truthful-awsome-inspiring documentary was compassionatly made straight from the heart with the intent to help others understand what Fibromyalgia (FM) is all about. No one is trying to sell you any thing here, rather to inspire and understand what FM is, in a beautiful way. How rare-thank you!! :)

After watching this film, I no longer feel all wierd and crazy with regard to my FM symptoms, rather I feel validated.

 Thank you for your dedication & love to your mother in making this film, because the rest of us with FM who may not have such dedicated family members, or for those of us who may not have the energy or resources to do the reasearch can now learn, & appreciate your journey of hope and understanding of what Fibromyalgia is.

This beautifully made film is a must have for any one who has Fibromyalgia (FM),or  a loved one or family member with FM.",1177113600,4,872,4.6
2712961,5,B000LQT4AU,"I saw a screening of this film at its premier in Southern California. The audience was comprised of those linked to fibromyalgia through personal experience, medical fields, and/or the media. It was truly amazing to hear the universally positive comments from those in attendance.

  Fibromyalgia is a complicated condition, and while this film cannot make it less so, it did help to break down the complex information into easily digestible pieces.

  Kudos to the film-maker's small family for making a big difference.",1176768000,11,520,5.280487804878049
2712962,5,B000LQT4AU,"Thank you so much for making this film. So many people have Fibromyalgia and each person feels different. Your film shows a different perspective from all of these people. I watched it alone first, than I watched it my Husband and I cryed because they said all the things I was feeling but couldn't express. I am passing it around to my family.",1176768000,11,344,4.476190476190476
2712963,3,B000LQT4AU,"I was a bit disappointed with this item. It didn't offer enough medical advice and it centered on several people that I truly didn't have much in common with even though I have fibromyalgia. I'm not a medical student, actress/model, or drag racer. I really expected to relate more to the people that were going to be in the movie. I wanted my family to watch it and know what I feel like on ""bad days"". I suppose it would be good to watch for someone that has just been diagnosed.",1176249600,9,480,4.285714285714286
8163809,4,B000LQT4AU,"A very informative documentary.  For me being a guy with Fibro, it helped to see a man's perspective too.  I enjoy what the women have to say, but it is a really different yet same journey for all of us with the disease.  I recommend this to anyone with questions or who may be wondering if they're ok, normal, etc.  If you have questions, or even if you don't, it is a fantastic place to start.  Another great place is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-First-Year-Fibromyalgia-An-Essential-Guide-for-the-Newly-Diagnosed/dp/1569245215/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The First Year: Fibromyalgia: An Essential Guide for the Newly Diagnosed</a>&nbsp;This book is a great resource that will expand on what you've learned in this documentary and get even deeper into the symptoms, techniques for handling them, and many other great and useful resources to navigate this often mysterious disease.

The only reason I couldn't give this a five star rating was that there are some moments of the filming that contain a hissing noise in the audio and for any fibro patient, that can be quite annoying and take away from what we're trying to focus on being said at the moment.",1465516800,,1207,5.4972972972972975
8163810,2,B000LQT4AU,This is for people who don't have FMS.  More of a picture for care takers and family.  Those of us that do have FMS won't find anything new in it's content.,1437177600,,156,4.0
8163811,5,B000LQT4AU,This is a great help if you have fibro and don't have a support group that you can attend.  It is also really good for family/friends because it explains the issues you can have with fibro,1428278400,,188,4.222222222222222
8163812,2,B000LQT4AU,I have Fibromyalgia..... I heard about this documentary and really looked forward to getting it.... and although I respect the concept and idea behind the documentary I do not feel like it really did justice in showing the true struggles people face with Fibro.... From a personal aspect I did not feel like this documentary represented the issues I have faced. ..... my review: disappointed,1409097600,,391,5.030769230769231
8163813,5,B000LQT4AU,This DVD has opened my mind and heart with both compassion with loved ones and passion to understand what life has presented them with. I highly recommend this DVD to any seeking learning about Living with Firbromyalgia together.,1389052800,,229,5.052631578947368
8163814,5,B000LQT4AU,This heartfelt film is really well done about a difficult illness that plagues more people than are diagnosed.  It helps family and friends to understand how it effects the lives of their loved ones.  Well rounded and informative.,1386288000,,230,5.026315789473684
8163815,5,B000LQT4AU,"For someone with Fibromyalgia, it was so cool to hear the testimonies of others with this disease (yes, it is called a disease by some in the medical community ;-) I liked the broad range of people interviewed (ex: a model, a previous auto mechanic, a housewife). And even though some of the information was not entirely new to me, it was a great synopsis of this condition and all the lifestyle adjustments one has to make. I would highly recommend it to those with Fibromyalgia and those without Fibromyalgia, as a very informative, well-thought-out film.",1360108800,,557,4.8125
8163816,2,B000LQT4AU,"My wife suffers from the devastating affects of Fibromyalgia. She finds this DVD ineffective ... at least for her. It's tragic that for years Fibro has not been recognized by the medical community as a disorder, but rather akin to hypochondria. And this, too: For three years she has been denied federal disability even though she is unable to workor even perform light household chores ... even unable to lift a gallon of milk from the fridge. I'm thankful, however, that she was not chosen to to inherit Lupus.",1353715200,,512,4.764044943820225
8163817,1,B000LQT4AU,"I resent this DVD and its misleading description of what this video is about.  It is supposed to be a ""video to help family members understand & support fibro patients..its not all in our heads"".  This DVD does everything BUT! I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia in 1989.  I have gotten increasing worse since then.  I am now in a hospital-type bed at home and need a motorized chair to go to doctor's appointments.  They tell you there are meds that help.  They DON'T tell you that over half the time, either your insurance won't pay for it, you can't afford it on your own, or if you're like me, because of suffering all these years and my body on so many different meds, your body may not be able to use any of the new drugs...which didn't help much anyway when I could take them. They say there's ""hope with exercise & meds""...but say nothing about when you get to the point where you are crippled and can't move any more.  This does NOT explain to your family...it only enables them to push you more, to say ""if they can do it, you can do it!"" Any family or friends watching this DVD would look at you the same negative way they always did...this DVD will do nothing to change that, because this DVD doesn't address that!  Why weren't there any severe cases on there?  Why was it all ""positive, positive, positive,"" when fibro isn't. Fibro does cripple. No matter how ""positive"" your thinking is!  Don't waste your money on this DVD like I did.  Save it for the meds...you'll need it!",1350950400,15,1487,4.430147058823529
8163818,1,B000LQT4AU,"This DVD may be good as a CD but not as a DVD. The format is two women talking with each other. One of the women has her back to the camera. There is no action or visuals of any kind except for the two women talking. They do not use microphones. The camera is stationary and set up at a distance from the women so that the whole picture of the women can be included. The only microphone is the microphone attached to the camera. Because of the distance, the woman facing the camera is difficult to hear but the woman with her back to the camera/microphone cannot be heard at all. The higher the volume is turned up, the greater the background noise.

This might have been much better as a CD where the women would each have a microphone and the listener would be able to have a clear understanding of their topic.",1341964800,3,813,4.211538461538462
