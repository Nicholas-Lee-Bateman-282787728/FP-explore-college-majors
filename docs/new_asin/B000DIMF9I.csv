It's really fun to see the interviews with all the uke makers and performers.  Plus the performances are fun to watch.  If you are a fantatical ukulele player, chances are you won't really learn much from the info here, but it's still fun to watch. If you're just beginning then you will learn most everything you need to know about the history of the uke and different types of ukes.  I wish there was a DVD extra where you could just watch the full performances, but oh well.  If you are a uke player who spends way too much money on ukes, spend a little extra and buy this DVD for your DVD library.",1209081600,3,728,4.362962962962963
