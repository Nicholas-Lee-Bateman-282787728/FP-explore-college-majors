3882836,5,B0029ZUQB2,"My boyfriend was thrilled to get this as an early Christmas gift. He'd lost his VHS copy a few years back, which he used to watch every year (though it was getting very old as VHS's tend not to last that long#, so he was estatic to receive this #since to our knowledge, this is the first time it has ever been on DVD). Even moreso to find there were other cartoons on the DVD as well as Mickey's Christmas Carol. Very fun, nice night. Well worth the money.",1260489600,,456,4.134831460674158
3882837,5,B0029ZUQB2,"After watching the disgustingly boring 2009 3D adaptation of Charles Dickens' classic A Christmas Carol I remembered how much I loved this Disney version and decided I had to watch it again.  I'm so glad I did!  25 minutes is the perfect length for the story, and nothing could be more charming than having it star all of our favorite Disney characters! This is the only version you'll ever need of the story.

Additionally I was excited about this DVD because I remembered loving ""Pluto's Christmas Tree"" and ""The Small One"".  They were even better than I remembered!  Pluto finds himself irked when Chip and Dale end up in the Christmas tree Mickey just cut down and The Small One is a very enchanting story about a boy who must sell his beloved donkey because he's getting too old to do chores.  I must admit I cried at the end!

""Santa's Workshop"" I didn't remember, but it was a fun animated journey through Santa's preparations for the big night.

Overall this is an AMAZING collection of short film.  The only thing that bothered me was how cheap the main menu was.  It had to have been put together on the Paint program, because it looks terrible.  I'm sure this might have been done on purpose to give the deluxe edition they'll release in 10 years a better look, but it was still sad.  Nonetheless I'll be watching these movies every Christmas, multiple times no doubt!",1259020800,22,1379,4.583673469387755
3882838,5,B0029ZUQB2,"It's about time that Disney released Mickey's Christmas Carol onto DVD!  I have been able to watch it on TV with my kids a few times, but it was always shortened (not the full length version).  I always enjoyed watching it when I was a kid (it came out when I was 5 years old), and I have enjoyed watching it each year with my own children on my old VHS copy (which is beginning to show its age now, and also look a bit ""worn out."")

Disney really seems to have forgotten a lot of their classic films from the 80's - my kids also love Gummi Bears, but they've only released a portion of those onto DVD.

Thank you, Disney, for bringing Mickey's Christmas Carol to DVD!

I'm sure you will love this DVD and enjoy Mickey's Christmas Carol just as much as my kids and I have.  This is definitely a must buy.",1258416000,2,804,4.121794871794871

3882840,5,B0029ZUQB2,I purchased this movie for my 5 year old daughter because I enjoyed it as a kid and hope she will feel the same.  It was always one of my favorites and I am sure she will love it when we watch it.,1255305600,,196,3.558139534883721
3882841,4,B0029ZUQB2,"As a child, I can easily remember my prized possession was a Walt Disney book that my father purchased for me and it featured the chronology of the early classic Walt Disney animated shorts.  Some of these shorts were shown on the Disney Channel when I was younger but suffice to say, with all the new animation, a lot of these classics have probably been forgotten or have been released on VHS video.

Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment are now releasing a few of these shorts on DVD for the first time (some have appeared on past Disney DVD releases).  Now the seventh volume of the Walt Disney Animation Collection will be released and the theme for this volume is Christmas.

In past volumes, we saw many of the Silly Symphony shorts from the 1929-1939 featured in each volume but this time around, we have a volume featuring animation shorts released in the 80's.  Also, the following shorts are much longer with most shorts in the past being around under 10 minutes, in this volume, the first two ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" and ""The Small One"" are over 20 minutes long.

The seventh volume ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" includes four shorts.  Included are:

  1. Mickey's Christmas Carol - (25:47) This popular Disney animated cartoon is from 1983 and has been featured on several DVD's in the past.  In an animated retelling of the Charles Dickens masterpiece, Scrooge McDuck plays Ebenezer Scrooge who is tight with money and puts money above everything.  Even on Christmas Eve, his poor employee Bob Cratchit (Mickey Mouse) is docked pay for Christmas vacation.  But its when the Ghosts of Christmas past pay a visit to Ebenezer and show him that he should have compassion for people.
  2. The Small One - (25:33)  A popular Disney animated cartoon from 1978.  A story about a boy who lives outside of Nazareth and because ""The Small One"", a donkey is getting too old, the boy's father tells him they must sell him.  The boy who absolutely loves the Small One is crushed but tells his father that he will be responsible in selling Small One and finding him a new home.  So, the boy and his donkey go to Nazareth.
  3. Pluto's Christmas Tree - (6:53) A 1952 Technicolor animated short.  Mickey cuts down a Christmas tree which is inhabited by two chipmunks: Chip and Dale and with Mickey and Pluto decorating the tree, Pluto is disturbed in finding out that the tree has two inhabitants living there.
  4. Santa's Workshop - (6:18) a Silly Symphony animation from 1932 featuring Santa and his elves preparing for Christmas day.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Walt Disney Animation Collection"" is featured with an aspect ratio of 1:33:1.  These classics are available on DVD for the first time but its important to mention that these animated shorts have not been digitally remastered or cleaned up.

As a matter of fact, you will see a lot of the dust and scratches of the film and some of the animation look fine for being nearly 70 years old but others look grainy and a bit aged.  Granted, these are not classic full featured films but I hope one of these days, many of these classics do get cleaned up or even digitally remastered.

As for the audio, audio is featured in Dolby Digital Surround Sound.  I found that on my home theater system, the best selection on my receiver to view these animated shorts was to switch it to mono or (if you have this capability) select stereo for all channels.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are no special features included on this DVD.  But this volume does come with a litho print from ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

As mentioned earlier in my review, my prized possession as a child was a Walt Disney booklet that covered the Walt Disney animated shorts in chronological order and had the opportunity to watch these classics.  Having these classic animated shorts from the past is great but also to have animation that I watched as a child during the Holidays, included on this DVD is awesome.  But most importantly, now that I can share these classics with my son.  These four animated shorts (and all previous volumes) are great for the families and in this volume's case, definitely worth sharing with the family during the holidays.

Of the released ""Walt Disney Animation Collection"" volumes, this volume is different in the fact that the past volumes featured shorts that had no dialogue (a few did but many didn't).  Mainly music and sound effects but with this volume, ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" and ""The Small One"" are two fantastic animated Disney cartoons that have  a touching storyline, beautiful animation and although more recent than the Silly Symphony shorts featured on previous volumes, they are definitely Disney classics!

For those who owned the 2005 DVD release of ""Walt Disney's Classic Cartoon Favorites, Vol. 09 - Classic Holiday Stories (1952-1983)"", may not need this volume as all animation from this DVD are included on the 2005 DVD release with the exception of ""Santa's Workshop"".  Unless you are diehard fan, then to have that DVD with the Silly Symphony short may be worth it to you.

I know that there are some who wish these classics were digitally restored or remastered but I doubt that Disney will do that for a lot of their animated shorts for now (although they are really doing a fantastic job on the Disney feature films such as ""Sleeping Beauty"", ""Pinocchio"" and ""Snow White"" for the Blu-ray release).

But overall, these collections are offered for a low price and if you are a Disney fan, it's a no-brainer that this volume is definitely worth it.  ""Walt Disney Animation Collection Vol. 7: Classic Short Films - Mickey's Chritmas Carol"" is definitely recommended!",1254355200,105,5659,4.792569659442725

3882851,5,B0029ZUQB2,"The 7th and last volume of Disney's 2009 Animation Collection is centered on Christmastime, starting with the Oscar-nominated, star-studded classic, Mickey's Christmas Carol! It also contains Pluto's Christmas Tree (a restored Treasures print), and edited versions of The Small One and Santa's Workshop (I know the latter was edited due to a Blackface doll gag; it was even more edited when seen on Turner Classic Movies, of all places, last Christmas). Better to have these like they are than nothing at all, even though this volume was vaulted due to the 2013 DVD/Blu-ray release of Mickey's Christmas Carol. Sadly, that release had a Faux-Widescreen print of this classic, instead of the natural Widescreen format used in one of Mickey's color Treasures tins. It's a wonder they didn't add The Night Before Christmas to this disc, uncut or otherwise, being a follow-up to Santa's Workshop. And people think the rationale of Autistic people like me is unexplainable (inexplicable, if you will)?! Like I keep saying, just be thankful for what you still have, and have a merry Christmas, too! Sadly, this collection never got past volume 7; it would've been awesome to see even more classic Disneytoon shorts in this short-lived collection of oldies-but-goodies!",1449014400,,1262,5.221674876847291

3882916,5,B0029ZUQB2,"First off, it's one of my favorite animated Disney short films that I grew up with. Plus, this year is when Mickey's Christmas Carol turned 30 this year. Yippee! And of course, the main character, Scrooge McDuck as Ebenezer Scrooge (voiced by Alan Young).

Now, there are 4 cartoons in this collection; Mickey's Christmas Carol, Small One, Pluto's Christmas Tree, and Santa's Workshop.

All right, Mickey's Christmas Carol: As you see, it's based on Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, and there are familiar faces throughout the movie. Mickey Mouse as Bob Crachit (voiced by Wayne Allwine), Donald Duck as Fred Scrooge (voiced by the late Clarence Nash), and I don't remember the voices of the rest of other characters, but I can call them out. Ratty and Moley as Collectors for the Poor from The Wind in the Willows, Goofy as Jacob Marley, Jiminy Cricket from Pinocchio as Ghost of Christmas Past, Daisy Duck as Isabella, Willie the Giant from Mickey and the Beanstalk as Ghost of Christmas Present, Minnie Mouse and family as Mrs. Crachit and children (incl. Tiny Tim), and Pete as Ghost of the Future (scary!).

Next, Small One: Basically, Small One was taken place before the Nativity story. You'll understand that in the ending.

And finally, two more cartoons: Pluto's Christmas Tree is when Mickey gets a tree in the beginning. Later on, Chip & Dale were inside of the Christmas tree. Pluto makes fail attempts to get them. In the end, Mickey found out why Pluto was acting weird. Of course, one of the chipmunks placed the Do Not Open 'til Christmas sticker on Pluto's mouth, just to stop his singing. For Santa's Workshop, it's one of those Silly Symphony. You can guess what it's about...Santa Claus and his little helpers are preparing for Christmas celebration.

3882923,5,B0029ZUQB2,Disney is at his best here.  Classic animation coupled with a traditional Christmas story.  Don't know if kids today will appreciate Mickey but we kids of yesterday still do.,1384214400,,174,4.9655172413793105
3882924,5,B0029ZUQB2,Looked for this movie everywhere. Love this classic Christmas story! It is also a very educational tool that helps children learn how they should and should not treat others.,1384128000,,174,5.0344827586206895

3882926,5,B0029ZUQB2,"Seller delivered quickly! Looking forward to enjoying this Disney classic with the family this year. Warning: the scene with the Ghost of Christmas future might be a little intense for little ones. There is a coffin...with flames. If you have a more sensitive child, I would recommend a 10 years+ viewing audience.",1383350400,,314,5.0576923076923075
3882927,1,B0029ZUQB2,Not appropriate for a toddler. Very disappointed. Scary at moments. Do not recommend this for others. Not good for holidays either.,1383091200,,131,5.285714285714286

3882934,1,B0029ZUQB2,The DVD came sealed in a plastic wrap with a sealed taped at the top of the DVD case.  It was opened as a gift at a party and NO DVD was in the case.  There were 3 pieces of paper for regarding the movie but no DVD.,1375142400,,215,3.4583333333333335
3882935,5,B0029ZUQB2,"If you ask me, Christmas movies don't have the same ""magic"" about them now as they did when I was a small child.  Maybe that is because I WAS a small child.  I attempt to watch the new cartoons that they put out during the holiday season, and they just aren't the same.  I guess I'm getting old.  It's nice to have something that may not be around ever again and be able to share it with children who would never have had the opportunity to see it.",1372809600,,448,4.056818181818182

They are able to relate to the familiar Disney characters and therefore quickly understand the story line.

3882950,5,B0029ZUQB2,This is a nice collection that included Mickey's Christmas Carol.  My HUSBAND was the one who wanted it.  He was pleasently surprised to open it on Christmas.  We've watched it several times each season since then.,1361404800,,214,4.888888888888889

3882954,5,B0029ZUQB2,"Mickey's Christmas Carol was one of my favorite Christmas programs as a child.  In my opinion, it is some of Mickey's best work.  They tell the story in a cute way that still hits on the main points that other versions of A Christmas Carol hit on.  There are a couple other shorts on this DVD, too.  They were fine, but Mickey's CC steals the show.",1361059200,,348,4.2272727272727275
3882955,5,B0029ZUQB2,"This DVD is more than just Mickey's Christmas Carol. There are a couple of ""shorts"" from the early days (30's / 40's) that are great to watch with children used to today's technologically advanced cartoons. It offers a wonderful opportunity to teach them history of old, and appreciation of what they take for granted today.",1360972800,,324,4.909090909090909
3882956,5,B0029ZUQB2,Fantastic set of short films from Disney.  I especially liked Small One which is the reason I purchased this copy in the first place.,1360972800,,133,4.541666666666667

3882958,5,B0029ZUQB2,"This adaptation of Charles Dicken's a Christmas Carol is classic.  Perfect for Old and young alike.  My son's loved this movie (20 years ago) and would watch it continually even out of Christmas Season.  Now I am a grandma and my Granddaughter LOVES Mickey Mouse, I knew I had to share this favorite from her Daddys childhood.  We snuggled with Popcorn and loved every minute.",1360281600,,376,4.7384615384615385

3882963,5,B0029ZUQB2,"Even as an adult I love this version of ""A Christmas Carol."" I bought this for my nephew who loves Mickey Mouse and has a December birthday. Although he doesn't necessarily understand the plot, I was told he watched it over and over again. :)",1359590400,,242,4.4
3882964,4,B0029ZUQB2,"Love this DVD for my 2 yr old son. There are only 4 cartoons on it, but the price is not too high so it is okay for the price. I was looking for the cartoon with Santa coming into someone's house and all the toys get ready and make the tree. You know, the one where Santa puts the baseball bat in the little boy's looooong stocking and laughs out loud? This DVD has ""Santa's workshop"" and I was hoping that cartoon was an extension to it. It's not. So, I still don't have my favorite Santa cartoon. But my son loved this DVD nonetheless. He was really into Small One too, it takes in Bethlehem so it has a little religious undertone (the donkey is bought by Joseph for his wife Mary to ride into Bethlehem). A great transition to talk to your child about Jesus if you are religious, and it's a very,very subtle undertone if you are not.",1359590400,,836,4.166666666666667
3882965,5,B0029ZUQB2,"Four cartoons in all. Others: ""Pluto's Christmas Tree"" and ""Santa's Workshop"".  The Santa short is actually half of a 2-parter and should have included ""The Night Before Christmas"", showing Santa delivering the toys. The Small One is an Oscar-winning cartoon by Don Bluth about a little donkey that has to be sold due to his age. He is sold to Joseph for Mary to ride. The transfer shows some wear and dirt --not cleaned up, but otherwise a nice copy. ""Pluto"" is the cartoon where Chip and Dale come home with the Christmas Tree that  Mickey chops down.

Mickey's Carol seems to ""run fast"" as it's timing is only 28 minutes. However, no scenes seem to be cut, unlike the recent airing on network and cable. Note: Film can be sped up to 26 FPS and beyond. (Watch the sit-coms on TVLand and notice how ""high"" everyone's voices are!)  A very good value for $10! Four cartoons for the price of one. Running time: about 80 minutes.",1359590400,,926,4.526946107784431

3882968,4,B0029ZUQB2,Got it for my grandchildren at their request.  Dickens' Christmas Carol has a wonderful message of love and kindness to others.  Characteristics that we want to build in our grandchildren.  This video will get the message across in a fun way.,1359331200,,242,4.853658536585366
3882969,5,B0029ZUQB2,Have been looking for this on dvd for a while now. Was so happy to find it.  This was our very first movie on vhs...so it brings back good memories every time we watch it.,1359331200,,171,3.8857142857142857
3882970,5,B0029ZUQB2,One the classic cartoon version that does not make it on t.v. anymore. This is why i bought it i like the classic cartoons and this is the only way to see them with seeing the same old shows over and over when they have these in their vault and refuse to air them anymore.,1359158400,,272,3.963636363636364
3882971,5,B0029ZUQB2,I bought this so I can complete my collection of Xmas movies to play while putting up the decorations around the home,1359072000,,117,4.363636363636363

Childhood revisited and enjoyed quite a lot.
Worth the minimal cost.",1358640000,,118,4.95
3882977,5,B0029ZUQB2,Used to have this on a video but misplaced it.  Glad to find it in DVD format.  It is a short retelling of the classic story and very charming.  There is a scary part (with the ghost of Christmas future) that may need you to hold on to some really tiny ones.,1358640000,,258,3.923076923076923
3882978,4,B0029ZUQB2,"Still a sweet (and short) classic.  I only wish that the shorts included were all of the same ones that they used to air on tv as part of the Mickey's Christmas Carol Special.  I especially miss The Goofy skiing short.  Also, the short Small One might be a little sad for sensitive kids. It has a nice ending, but is a little rough leading up to that.",1358553600,,351,4.132352941176471

3882984,3,B0029ZUQB2,"After reading several of the reviews here, I purchased this one. I'd planned it, anyway, since last Christmas (each year my wife and I purchase a few more Christmas dvds). All I can say is that this was not my most exceptional purchase. It appears that the reviewers here are looking at this one through rose-colored glasses. Now, we own 'A Charlie Brown Christmas' (on the Peanuts 1960s Collection), all the important Rankin/Bass ('Rudolph', 'Santa Claus is Comin to Town', 'Frosty', etc) and 'Mr Magoo's Christmas Carol' (all on 'The Original Christmas Classics'), 'It's a Wonderful Life', 'Little Women' (1994 version), 'Dr Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas', 'A Christmas Story', etc ... but they are all good on their own level. This one, however, is simply for those who grew up with it and have fond memories, for memories are all that could push this one forward.",1358208000,,875,4.918918918918919
3882985,5,B0029ZUQB2,"I bought this just for Mickey's Christmas Carol, which we'd had on VHS and completely worn out.

You'll see many of the Disney mainstay characters in the lead parts and the story is presented in typical Disney fashionshort and sweet. The backgrounds are beautiful. A fun game you can do, after you've seen it a few times, is to notice the extra characters and try to figure out what movie or short did they originally appear.",1357516800,,448,4.54320987654321

Unfortunately, this movie is one that I'll be storing away and possibly trying again in a few more years. Mickey's Christmas Carol freaked my daughter out, specifically because of Pete's character (the Ghost of Christmas Past). He's cloaked and actually quite menacing and frightful. In one scene he stands over Scrooge laughing, his eyes reflecting flames while Scrooge dangles, screaming, over a fiery grave. And then he watches as Scrooge falls in. It was all just a dream, but not something a toddler can process and differentiate well.

I'm so disappointed that this movie is not more toddler-friendly!",1355184000,3,847,5.042857142857143

It also has the equally fun ""Pluto's Christmas Tree"", in which Mickey brings home a tree, not knowing that Chip and Dale live in it.  Anyone with a dog can envisage the hilarious results of Pluto's efforts to get rid of their new house-guests.  With two additional fun shorts, it's a great investment for years of Christmas viewing.

On nice feature this DVD has is the option to Watch All, so that it simply goes through all four, without needing parents to keep starting the next show for the little ones.",1353715200,,590,4.644230769230769

This is truly G rated but sophisticated enough to appeal to all ages like the old Loony Tunes and Peanuts cartoons. They just do not make cartoons like this anymore.,1325894400,,482,4.604651162790698

REVIEW

This is a very good creative adaptation of the Dickens story.  Featuring the voice talents of Alan Young, Wayne Allwine and Hal Smith, among others, this film hearkens to the golden age of the 1930's for animated short film.

Necessarily shortening and simplifying Dickens' novel and its language, it nevertheless retains a glimmering intelligence and understated sophistication.  Additionally, the soundtrack is superb, especially the opening number ""Oh, What A Merry Christmas Day.""  The roles of Dickens' ghosts are fulfilled by Disney characters, and for the most part I cannot complain.  Even Goofy as Jacob Marley fits because the creative staff retain the basic original plotline which Dickens created for his character.  This treatment also pleasantly undercuts the harder edge of the Marley character by injecting skillful humor into key moments.  The only character choice for a ghost I did not like at all was Willie the Giant from ""Mickey and the Beanstalk.""  That character is just too overbearing and lacking in the stateliness I've associated with The Ghost of Christmas Present for all of my life.  A very abbreviated appearance by The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come, here called The Ghost of Christmas Future, is fittingly bleak and may provide the biggest scare of the movie for very young children.  That moment of the film is so brief, though, that after a hiccup, it's over.

Featuring fairly early animation by the great Glen Keane and even John Lasseter, the current head of Pixar, ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" is a classic animated short film of Dickens' classic novel and stands the test of time beautifully.",1263686400,,1803,5.211805555555555
3883082,5,B0029ZUQB2,"""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" was a hit with our entire family and was watched over and over before, during and after the Christmas holiday.  It includes 4 short movies, which was wonderful for the attention span of a 4-year-old.  One of the ""shorts"" was a very old cartoon of Santa's Workshop, but was still fun to watch.  I personally love the story of the Christmas Carol in all of its styles.  Mickey was no exception.  You can't go wrong with Disney!",1262131200,,452,4.6
3883083,5,B0029ZUQB2,"A Christmas Story, It's a Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th Street, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, Home Alone, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, Elf, A Charlie Brown Christmas, A Garfield Christmas, How the Grinch Stole Christmas, Scrooge, Scrooged, Die Hard . . . the list is endless. There are dozens and dozens of films and TV specials that deal with the holidays. Some of good, others are just downright horrible. A few of them are considered some of the finest (Lampoon and Wonderful Life), while others are just mediocre (Jingle all the Way, The Santa Clause). But no matter what, most of these films and TV specials are always perfect for this time of year. And if you're a Disney fan, then Mickey's Christmas Carol would be the right one for you. This DVD features four films: Mickey's Christmas Carol, The Small One, Santa's Workshop, and Pluto's Christmas Tree. Christmas Carol is a half-hour adaptation of Dickens's classic story. The characters are played by Mickey, Scrooge McDuck, Pete, and more. It's what you would expect from vintage Disney: great animation, sharp writing, and some dark moments that you would NEVER see in today's Disney world. The Small One, also half-and-hour long, is by Don Bluth (of Land Before Time fame), and it tells the story of a young boy who must sell his aging donkey whom he adores very much. It's a very religious story, and some people may want to keep a box of Kleenex handy. Santa's Workshop and Pluto's Christmas Tree are both classic Disney shorts that deserve recognition, but I wish they added Toy Tinkers (starring Chip, Dale, and Donald Duck) on this DVD.

Still, this is something that I can easily recommend to people of all ages. All four films (except maybe Santa's Workshop which looks a bit outdated) are excellent for the holiday season. In fact, you can see all four of them along with the other Christmas classics. You know, there are so many Christmas films and specials that I think I would lose count if I named all of them at once. Overall, these are the ones that make us feel and revel in the spirit of the holidays. Whether it's Mickey's Christmas Carol or A Charlie Brown Christmas, whether it's Miracle on 34th Street or National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, or whether it's Home Alone or A Christmas Story, you can never go wrong with ""the most wonderful time of the year.""",1261526400,15,2356,4.746341463414634
3883084,4,B0029ZUQB2,"This is a very charming collection of short holiday stories from Disney.  Though the collection varies fairly widely in tone from one cartoon to the next, all are good and have broad appeal.  Mickey's Christmas Carol (26 minutes, 1983) is an amiable re-telling of Dickens' classic that strikes just the right chord for young viewers, avoiding the typically frightening atmosphere that many adaptations maintain (think ghost of Jacob Marley and the grim reaper ghost of Christmas future).  The animation is classic Disney and is gorgeous.  The Small One (26 minutes, 1978) is a surprisingly sweet and low-key tale about a special diminutive donkey that finds his niche within the nativity story.  It features memorable songs and genuine emotional weight that is a nice alternative to the usual madcap flavor of most cartoons.  Pluto's Christmas Tree (7 minutes, 1952) is a very straightforward cartoon in the most traditional sense - short, heavy on the physical humor, and good fun.  It too is typical old-fashioned Disney, well-animated and lots of charm.  Santa's Workshop (7 minutes, 1932) is the slightest of the bunch and while pleasant it isn't particularly memorable.  It follows Santa and his helpers as they get ready for Christmas.  It is the oldest of the four videos on this collection and shows every bit of its age.  If you've seen Steamboat Willie then this will feel familiar, though it is in color.
This is a solid collection of fun Christmas-themed stories that will appeal to kids and families of all ages.  My 4 1/2 year old son enjoyed all of the videos despite how diverse they are, and I look forward to enjoying them again and again during Christmas seasons to come.",1261440000,8,1690,4.953900709219858

3883087,5,B0029ZUQB2,"Disney knows how to capitalize on their popular products.  This disc contains shorts that have already been released on DVD.  But all those old releases are out of print.  And these four shorts have never been released together before.  So if you've missed them, here's a great way to get them.

Of course, short is a subjective term since two of them are around 25 minutes each.  Up first is ""Mickey's Christmas Carol.""  In this classic take on the Dickens' tale, the parts are played by Mickey and his pals.  Mickey takes on Bob Cratchit, leaving the Scrooge role to Scrooge McDuck.  As much as I love some of the straight adaptations of the classic, I love this one, too.  Given the time constraints, they cut a lot out, but it is still entertaining.

The other longer piece is ""The Small One.""  This short finds a boy attempting to find a loving home for his favorite donkey.  He wanders all over the ancient village until a man needs asks him for the animal to carry his pregnant wife on a journey.  The spiritual overtones are a little surprising, but I find the short overall a little long.  Cutting out a few minutes would have made it better over all.

In the true shorts category, we've got ""Pluto's Christmas Tree,"" a piece that finds Pluto trying to rid the house of Chip 'n' Dale who have stowed away in Mickey's Christmas tree.  It's rather funny.  And they really reached into the vault for 1932's Santa's Workshop.  This one is definitely dated, and one of the jokes would be racist today.  But the majority of the cartoon is still clever.

Even with one of the offerings being a little weak, the rest of the disc is very strong.  If you don't already have these shorts, you might want to consider getting this release while you still can.",1260921600,,1755,4.504761904761905
