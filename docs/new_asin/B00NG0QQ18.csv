6648734,5,B00NG0QQ18,Absolutely amazing!!!!!!. Hands down one of my favorite movies of the year. I can't say enough good things about this movie and its director. If you haven't already seek out his other titles as well.,1410307200,,199,4.714285714285714
6648735,5,B00NG0QQ18,"Absolutely loved it, only wish it was longer! Brilliant fight scenes, especially the finale. Would love for there to be a continuation at some point of either a prequel or a sequel just to get more stories from this universe.",1410307200,,225,4.65
8677796,1,B00NG0QQ18,The 5 star ratings and reviews raving about how great this film is are fake and most likely people making money from sales. The film is absolutely terrible. Poor acting. Poor story. Very low budget that a description of the film isn't even on the back. Throwing this one in the bin or giving it away.,1509667200,,300,4.375

8677798,1,B00NG0QQ18,"Gratuitous nudity.  Check out the peeing through a bush, into a bush.  Cheap, low budget, bad acting, predictable.  Not really worth one star.  This is why there's a fast forward feature.  It was free with Prime, but I still want a refund.",1479859200,,239,4.595238095238095

8677800,1,B00NG0QQ18,"This movie is not worth 50 cents , total piece of garbage Disney makes better "" scary "" movies Man I was a sucker for buying this , DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY -- Whoever rated this high has obviously not seen a real movie in this genre-- Check out "" I Spit on Your Grave "" instead",1439856000,4,276,3.8596491228070176
8677801,5,B00NG0QQ18,"A fantastic micro budget film by Dustin Mills! KTB is dark,fun,crazy film from a very competentDirector. If your tired of the same old Hollywood crud. Give ktb a try.",1421193600,,166,4.758620689655173
8677802,4,B00NG0QQ18,"The reason I love this film is because it's not your average slasher, it's much more! it's great and a sequel would do it well.",1420156800,,127,4.12
8677803,5,B00NG0QQ18,"I really really liked this movie, and it has high re-watch value. I wasn't sure what was coming, and it kept me thinking and guessing the entire time. After it was over, I sat there just thinking ""holy s#!%"" how cool and creative some of the scenes were after seeing the whole thing. I think you appreciate it more on a second or third viewing. I also really dug Dustin's commentary, which also gave me a few ""holy s#!%, that's so cool"" moments.",1411862400,3,445,4.373493975903615
8677804,5,B00NG0QQ18,"Highly original, energized indie horror. Kill That Bitch is superb, especially when you take what the budget must have been into consideration. Easily one of the more delightful surprises I've come across in awhile, this sucker has 10 times the energy of your average Hollywood horror flick. If you're looking for something different, look no further...",1410480000,,353,5.321428571428571
