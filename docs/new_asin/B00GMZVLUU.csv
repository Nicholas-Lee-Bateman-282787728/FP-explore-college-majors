8624997,5,B00GMZVLUU,"By far the best Alaska hunting DVDs available. Content is real, real Alaskan Trophies are harvested and Billy Molls is the real deal, no Hollywood producing, just real awesome hunting footage that all hunters want to see!",1491177600,,221,5.0
8624998,5,B00GMZVLUU,"Just watched both Season 5 and 6 and they are outstanding. Both are now 2 discs each, which encompasses a lot more scenery, behind the scenes footage and reflections from Billy. The earlier videos had great footage, but it appears like he got an HD camera and is better at editing, as both these videos are very professional. You can tell by the relationships he has with coworkers and his hunters that he's a genuine guy, works hard and earns the respect others give him. I'll definitely keep buying future seasons",1489190400,,515,4.670329670329671
8624999,5,B00GMZVLUU,"Im a stay at home mom, and I can honestly say I watch these over and over again. Just the past few years have I been able to hunt (now that my kids are older) and while I wait for September to roll around, these DVDs get me through. ;)

Such good videography and great hunts. My husband who isn't a hunter loves them for the super cubs.",1488153600,,336,3.9411764705882355

8625001,5,B00GMZVLUU,"All of his videos are fantastic, hard to say which is his best yet, so I'll put it this way.......Buy them all because they are all fantastic and each one will leave you  wanting more.  Season six is no exception. Great video, can't wait for Season 7",1436572800,,250,4.297872340425532
8625002,5,B00GMZVLUU,"Magnificent!!!  I just finished Billy's Season Six and it left me wanting me more. I have watched a lot of hunting videos in my time but this one is at the top.  I was very impressed by the overall realism of the hunts; realism is not the right word as the hunts were clearly all filmed in real time with NO commercialism.  I found this to be very refreshing; to be able to sit down and just watch quality hunting.  Billy obviously is an extremely knowledgable guide.  I was impressed by the cinematography and quality of the video as the hunt was occurring.  Also, the hunters themselves were all excellent shots; which is an indication of the kind of guide Billy is, that he can attract such quality hunters.  There was great variety in the hunts; from Dall Sheep in the Brooks Range to Kodiak Browns. It was encouraging to watch the hunts that normal every day guys and one hard core lady were able to pull off.  Billy also does a great job of explaining the animals behavior and the hunt. Everything is here, magnificent country, animals, weather,great people and hunting.  To get four hours of quality hunts for this price is really remarkable. My next hunting DVD will for sure be another Modern Day Mountain Man video.  I have never hunted Alaska but if I am ever blessed to be able to; it will hopefully be with Billy Molls!!",1429920000,,1333,4.4937759336099585

8625004,5,B00GMZVLUU,"Season 6 Modern Day Mountain Man is Billy Molls latest addition to his outstanding self produced hunting DVD's.
I often ask myself, can his next DVD better the previous one, it probably will be as good, but, no this DVD goes further, this is exceptional filming in often dangerous or atrocious conditions.
How does Billy Molls do this?, because he dedicates his knowledge, experience, outstanding filming skills, honesty, friendly nature and love of Alaska and it's big game, to every hunter that passes through his camp. Every hunt on this DVD invites you along. The viewers get up close to the big game species of Alaska, you fly with Billy in the SuperCubs as they weave through the Alaskan wilderness, you feel the cold as he wades into icy fast flowing rivers, your heart pumps harder as he re-assures, calms and guides the hunter through a thrilling stalk and eventual taking of the trophy. You are a part of every hunt, you feel the warmth as he enjoys a coffee with breakfast or a hot evening meal in camp, reliving the days hunt, planning the next days action, talking with his hunter about what their hunting experiences are. I can assure anyone interested in Alaska or hunting big game that this DVD is a must in any collection.",1388361600,,1239,4.6880733944954125
8625005,5,B00GMZVLUU,"After dreaming most of my childhood about hunting in Alaska, I made my first trip there in 2005 (Dall Sheep).  I was instantly hooked, became an Alaska hunting fanatic and made my second trip in 2006 (Moose).  I first discovered Billy Molls DVDs in 2009 when preparing for a do-it-yourself Caribou hunt in the Brooks Range in 2010.  Now, I own all of Billys DVDs (in addition to another 20 or so Alaska hunting DVDs).  They're the most authentic Alaska hunting videos...Period!  Each of Billys DVDs let you experience and appreciate what its like to hunt in Alaska for Brown Bear, Dall Sheep, Moose and Caribou, and I can say without a doubt this is by far his best effort.  If you like Alaska hunting or plan on hunting Alaska, do yourself a favor and buy this DVD.  I promise when you're done, youll buy Billys other DVDs too.",1385942400,2,828,4.516778523489933
