7937132,5,B00005B6L8,"This movie was on TV a year ago, and I caught the last half hour of it. Searched to see when it would be on again. Of course, good movies seem to only be on once. Began a search for it online and was happy to find it. Now I understand how the story came about.",1239148800,,260,3.6607142857142856
7937133,2,B00005B6L8,"This movie might be all right if you're 12 years old, otherwise, skip this one.

The one positive, is that it is a clean, family film, that is why it got 2 stars instead of 1.",1236038400,,175,3.861111111111111
