8761459,5,B01FSGKK5U,"Fine set;  Italiana in Algiers has the perfect cast and enchanting swinging 60's production.  The lead actress in title role is stunning - a super hot Italian tomato!  What opera soprano can successfully wear a bikini on stage.  I don't know if she performs outside of Italy, but she should be a star.
Really an enjoyable opera all around, and I haven't even seen the rest of the set yet.",1519948800,,388,4.5
8761460,4,B01FSGKK5U,"The ROF experiments with staging, costumes and story lines in ways that some established opera houses might not. They do present the music and librettos as written.

This box sets consists of 5 previously issued DVDs in their original cases, housed in a thin cardboard box. The operas are:

MOS&Egrave; IN EGITTO (3.5 stars)
[Excellence of the production (4.5 stars); faithfulness to storyline (2.5 stars)]
This was a compelling production to watch. Both the singing & acting were excellent but sadly, the director hijacked the storyline. Moses leading the Hebrews slaves out of Egypt became the morally ambiguous story of the Palestinian/Israeli conflict, with the Jews as sometime terrorists, sometime freedom fighters. The action on the stage often did not match the libretto.

LA SCALA DI SETA (4.1 stars)
Excellent singing and acting. The set was very ""busy"" with furniture, etc, compounded by an overhead mirror that reflected everything. Otherwise, well done overall.

CIRO IN BABILONIA (4.0 stars)
Excellent singing. The opera was presented as a silent movie. Part of the chorus was the movie audience. The stage lights cast a black and white look. The singers mimicked the melodramatic actions of some old movies, which lessened their ability to otherwise act.  Intertitles similar to ones in the old silent movies were displayed. The lines and artifacts that appear when old movies are projected were themselves projected onto the stage, sometimes annoying the viewer. Costumes were dazzling.

IL SIGNOR BRUSCHINO (4.5 stars)
This opera was set in the ""Rossiniland"" theme park. ""Il Signor Bruschino"" was presented as one of the park's attractions. The singing was mostly excellent, sometimes exceptional. The acting was outstanding. Costumes and scenery were excellent. The stage design made superb use of space.

L'ITALIANA IN ALGERI (4.2 stars)
The singing and acting were excellent. This was another ""festival"" type production full of movement, props and choreographed action. Sometimes, as is the case with this type of production, the words coming out of the singers' mouths didn't match what was happening on the stage.
