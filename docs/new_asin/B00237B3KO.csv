Jonny Test is one of those rare cartoons that can be entertaining to both kids and adults.  It can be a bit crude at times, but once you get past that, it's hilarious!  Of course, Dukey is the most intelligent, SANE, member of the family, and his comments on the others are often right-on.  I recommend Jonny Test most heartily!",1297900800,3,468,4.458823529411765
8551515,1,B00237B3KO,"this is a horrible cartoon. poorly written, unoriginal, and extremely boring. its one of the worst new shows cartoon network is deciding to air for some reason when they could be airing GOOD shows like billy and mandy. Avoid this show, don't waste your money.",1255910400,,259,4.777777777777778
