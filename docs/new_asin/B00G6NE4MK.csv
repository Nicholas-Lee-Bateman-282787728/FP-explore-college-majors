I watch many movies.... this one had all of the worst. The acting was bad, but the editing was worse. I have to say the directing topped both of them in being absolutely horrible.

I imagine there are yoga Gurus out there who actually act like that, but none I've run into, and I've met a few.

Everything was overdone, from the mother-in-law to the Guro to the wife going on vacation.

Don't waste your money or time, please.

My wife and I stopped watching this one about 20 minutes into it, it was that bad. I've only not watched a movie through about 3 times in my life, if that gives you an idea of how bad it was. I try to give them a chance, but when they used the phrase ""crackalackin"", and actually used a record scratching as a sound effect, I was done.

Horrible!",1391212800,6,979,4.293478260869565

6061683,5,B00G6NE4MK,This is a very funny movie.  Silly humor but funny.  Many times you think they are  going in a certain directionn but then you are surprised.  I liked it a lot.,1391040000,4,160,4.064516129032258
6061684,1,B00G6NE4MK,not sure if these reviews were written by cronies or what but this movie was terrible. You couldn't really blame the actors as script was just dreadful.,1391040000,5,152,4.666666666666667
6061685,5,B00G6NE4MK,"Finally a fun movie for all, regardless of gender or age!  It was so very entertaining, great cast also......I think Rossi Morreale has a bright future on the screen.  He was perfect in this role!  Will definitely watch this one again and again.....everyone should definitely have this movie!",1390608000,5,292,5.041666666666667
6061686,5,B00G6NE4MK,Heard about this movie from a friend and was pleasantly surprised.  Ali and Rossi make the movie very enjoyable.  One of the better comedies we have seen a while and definitely the best comedy of 2013.,1390521600,3,201,4.555555555555555
6061687,5,B00G6NE4MK,"This is cute, funny movie that is fun for everyone.

6061689,5,B00G6NE4MK,"Such a great cast, Ali Cobrin's acting is at her best. The Yoga girls with Jesse Golden, Irina Vorinina, Catherine Shu and even the comical Delane Mathews are something else. Rossi Morreale as the leading man plays the husband to a tee.",1388620800,5,236,4.642857142857143

6061692,1,B00G6NE4MK,Probably the worst movie I have watched in the last 10 years.  Simply horrible acting and an idiotic plot.  Terrible and a waste of money.  I kept waiting for it to get good.........it never did.,1396137600,2,195,4.514285714285714
6061693,2,B00G6NE4MK,"The acting is subpar, the editing was terrible, the soundtrack was meh, and the script writing was on par with high school drama skits. It should have been free or a $0.99 rental.",1395446400,,179,4.454545454545454
6061694,1,B00G6NE4MK,"The movie was just terrible.  It was supposed to be a comedy but I found it to be extremely boring and extremely un-funny.  I couldn't even finish the movie, it was that bad. It is amazing to me that studios will actually make such low rent garbage these days.  The only thing that I truly wish for is my money back.  Please do not waste your money on this movie.",1395360000,2,363,4.142857142857143
6061695,3,B00G6NE4MK,at times you just had to go along with the plot instead of picking it apart. I still enjoyed it and the yoga friend played a great role. Made the movie worth it.,1392940800,2,161,3.909090909090909
6061696,2,B00G6NE4MK,"Sometimes I wonder who and how the hell people can give a flick like this 5 stars, I give it two because the story line was good but carried out terribly. My pride of watching what i payed for is the only thing that made me finish it",1392681600,5,233,3.875
6061697,4,B00G6NE4MK,Great looking Cast in a light hearted story about the perils of being a man in SOCAL..  where with all the temptations  Life CAN be an Itch!  Fun Fun Fun !,1392595200,,155,3.935483870967742

6061699,5,B00G6NE4MK,"In a world where infidelity and sexuality have become the lazy prop on which to lean on (in marketing films and their box office success) comes this refreshing comedy where characters actually hold fast to their values all the while driving home a brilliantly creative script. The acting, comedic delivery, writing and overall production, while not having the deep pockets of a Hollywood block buster made this film my surprise favorite comedy of the last year.
What's in store from the team that produced this movie I have no idea, but I'm truly excited for what comes next...",1391472000,6,577,4.8979591836734695

8621096,5,B00G6NE4MK,"more to this unknown movie than given by press. nice film to share with family as ending pulls it all together with happy, get-moving message. funny, actors easy on eyes, music good, message of film great. watch the extras and you will want to get off couch and exercise, not bad for movie costing less than $10.",1428105600,,312,4.491228070175438
8621097,4,B00G6NE4MK,Love ALI. Also Love IRINA VERONICA in it.,1413676800,,41,4.25
8621098,1,B00G6NE4MK,"From the script to the editing to the sound to the acting, ""Life's An Itch"" was painfully hard to watch. It looked like someone's high school drama and film clubs got too much encouragement; I am fairly sure this movie was edited on iMovie.

What is particularly disappointing is the clunky script and the clunkier editing.  While the idea of the story, or at least the one portrayed in the trailer, was at least mildly interesting, the script often verged on making almost no sense. Take the scene where Cobrin's character explains her tragic past: she says, ""when they pulled my parents from the wreckage of our small plane, they died and I lived.""  That is such poor writing, it was almost physically painful to see the actors struggle through. As bad as the script was, the editing all of the editing was far worse.

Smash cuts from one unintroduced character to another, a lack of any kind of establishing shots, abrupt cuts in the middle of dialogue, et al. made for an unstable and disjointed pace.  It sapped any energy the actors may have brought to the screen; why would anyone do that and how could they not have seen it during final cut?

Were someone to go back, tediously re-edit and present this movie again, the lack of quality writing combined with sub-par acting has doomed this movie to the demo reel of only the most desperate persons listed in conjunction with it on IMDB.  If I was one of them, I would petition to have ""Life's an Itch"" expunged from my film credits.  Or at least have had the dignity to attribute it to Alan Smithee.",1405987200,,1556,4.551971326164875
8621099,1,B00G6NE4MK,"This movie is categorized as a romantic comedy, but it has absolutely no comedic or romantic plot elements.  The movie art and ""unrated"" rating suggest that there is some other reason to watch this, but I assure you it's PG at best.  So awful.",1405123200,,243,4.5
8621100,2,B00G6NE4MK,"The trailer looked much cuter and funnier than the movie actually was.  It was just an okay movie, not worth the money to rent.",1403308800,,127,4.291666666666667
8621101,2,B00G6NE4MK,This movie should have been free.  It was hilarious in a corny B-rate movie way.  I do not recommend it.,1402444800,,104,4.15
8621102,1,B00G6NE4MK,"My fiance and I could only watch twenty minutes of this movie the first night. We actually came back to it a second time only to justify the money spent and a desperate hope to be entertained. These reviews would have been helpful before we watched the movie; we wished we would have read them.  This is our first review as we have never felt so strong about a film, if you could call it that. This is an attempt to warn you to save your time and money, avoid this movie. The acting, directing, script and editing are terrible.  In addition, the consistent camera angles showcasing boobs just makes the movie even more pitiful.  We'll save you the trouble, the main plot is, if you are stressed out, do yoga.  Direct your money elsewhere, you will thank us.",1401148800,,757,4.424460431654676
8621103,4,B00G6NE4MK,"If you need a funny, offbeat, lighthearted movie with beautiful women and scenery, then this one is for you.  I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it to all.",1399248000,,163,4.433333333333334
8621104,3,B00G6NE4MK,"There is something amazing about ""LIfe's an Itch"". Maybe it isn't amazing, but in this day of cookie-cutter movies and test-audience ruined movies, something great happened with it. It's a shame though that this off the radar, low budget, poorly handled at times movie will probably never hear this from anybody but this little tiny review from little tiny ol' me. I'm not just anybody though. I am a movie critic, I have a film degree, I am a screenwriter and I have had one script nearly sold to Paramount and another made into a low budget movie. So, my opinion isn't to be taken with a grain of salt.

""Life's An Itch"" could have been much better had it been left to season a little bit more. It could have been a better movie had the lead male actor been more prepared or better. It could have been a better movie had the editor left a couple inexcusable bad edits in the movie; including a sound-looping edit where the person speaking's mouth is obviously not moving and a scene where Ali Corbin's character Gillian Gracin is doing yoga outside a window and a quick cut outside has her doing something completely different. It could have been better had they decided early on to be a little more silly and realize they were making a movie about yoga and had some fun with it. It could have been better had many of the camera shots served only the purpose of showing off an extremely attractive actress.

What was great or 'amazing' about the movie though was its ability to go after a taboo subject and handle it with great care when most movies just avoid it. You see, in movies where infidelity is prevalent or possible, it is typically frowned upon because it casts the characters in a negative light. In a light movie such as this, it is even more frowned upon. Yet, what happened here wasn't that; it was about two people who didn't expect to connect, but did. Just because people are married doesn't mean they can't still bond with someone of the opposite sex, or even find platonic love. In ""Life's an Itch"", a musician and a yoga instructor connect. Thanks to Ali Corbin pretty much nailing every emotion; joy, curiosity, cuteness, sorrow, regret and peacefulness, this connection works greatly.

""Life's an Itch"" is not a good movie, but it could have been had the creators taken a little bit more time and put out a better product. Too often, people get scripts, cameras and excitement that they're making a movie and rush ahead before making sure they are ready. I guess that's what separates the Spielbergs, Finchers and Hitchcocks of the world from the countless people these days that can get a hold of equipment and make movies.

I bought ""Life's an Itch"" and I'm glad I did. There is so much redeeming about Ali Corbin's performance along with a message about platonic love and the need for people to be good to each other, that it is in the least worth a viewing. Just understand that from a technical standpoint, the pre & post-production should have lasted much much much longer.",1398297600,,3004,4.588454376163873
