8473329,3,B000NNFWDO,"Now, these trailer compilations are always a good time. However, you should know that this particular entry is rather shoddy, especially for something made in 1998! False information and confusing narration abounds, and it's pretty clear that the people who put this tape together didn't actually know that much about Godzilla. They just took whatever they had lying around and tossed it in. We get the usual introduction with George Melie's Trip to the Moon, and the usual rundown on stop motion animation, Willis O'brien, and King Kong as a build up to the '50s and the debut of Godzilla. There are a lot of American monster movie trailers offered as comparison. The narrator talks over many of the trailers, and at one point he retells an anecdote he just said, in that ponderous, bored voice he uses throughout the tape. They must have been hard up for real material - near the end of the tape, the narrator starts quoting trivia out of David Kalat's ""Critical History and Filmography"" of the Godzilla series! Never mind that if you're going to read right out of Kalat's book, you might as well take the juicy stuff and not just some trivia. There's a lot of footage taken from Godzilla vs Megalon, owing to its [now defunct] public domain status. The tape ends with Marv Newman's ubiquitous old cartoon, Bambi Meets Godzilla.

As much as I've nitpicked, these things are always fun, and this one is no exception. There are some great trailers included, like Godzilla vs Megalon and Godzilla vs the Smog Monster. Some of the other trailers for color films are b/w copies, but widescreen - including Rodan and Godzilla vs the Thing. Despite its shortcomings, don't hesitate to check it out!",1298332800,2,1693,4.7979452054794525
