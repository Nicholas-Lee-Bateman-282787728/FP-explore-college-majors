Over the past 21 years I've had about 3 different copies ranging from VHS to DVD.  All suffered from very poor picture and sound.  I must say this is as of 2013, the DEFINITIVE copy of the film.  It contain the best picture quality and sound I've yet seen.",1380672000,3,382,4.108108108108108
1080236,1,6305827648,"Actually it's not a horror movie at all - it's a musty mash of soggy romance and boggy medical thriller with a dribble of zombie flick dripped in at the very last second. It's also dull with a capital D, in that special way only the dregs of Brit cinema can be! My childhood crush on Hazel Court earns it half a star... otherwise avoid this dog or you'll get bit too!",1341014400,2,367,4.111111111111111
1080237,3,6305827648,"Thanks to Amazon's bizarre policy of blending reviews of different releases of the same film, you have to look extra hard to determine what posts are referring to what versions.  The MGM dvd-r is a very nice remastered release, 16X9 anamorphic and no doubt looks as good as this film ever will (which technically is quite nice, actually).  The controversy of dvd-r media aside, this is the one to get if you want the professional studio release.",1323043200,16,445,4.766233766233766

1080239,3,6305827648,"This flick is a well shot movie that wasn't a high budget affair.
The film when seen on tcm in hd looks great and it really adds to it's enjoyment. Here you get a decent film transfer at best. Cheezy and alpha video usually just find the best print they can which is not the same as a better dvd release, but many of the films they put out won't get released at all otherwise.  This one was filmed back in 1961 and for that era the zombie at the end is extremely well done but the rest of the film features the mad doctor kidnapping people so he can get their hearts and put them into a deadman.  In spite of this being low budget it's not done by a first time director instead it's a studio affair from the uk film industry that means that you get lots of people who had movies and tv before and good actors.  This isn't a modern horror movie but it's still a decent little flick because kieren moore plays a good fanatic doctor and Hazel court always adds a strong beautiful screen presence in her movies.  The film does in fact feature a coffin scene in which a murder victim is placed in a coffin but it's not dr. bloods coffin. Yes the doctors name is really blood!  This is not a bad movie for fans of old style horror movies and best of all it's in color!.  That always helps when you have great oceanside scenery like in this movie.  Don't expect a great movie and a great print on this one but if  you can catch this on tcm in hd it's alot better view. Of course a regular critic would give this 2 or less stars because it's a hokey horror thing but who cares because I enjoy oldtime horror.",1280361600,,1600,4.105769230769231
1080240,3,6305827648,"My heading pretty much says it all, the sound is fine but the picture looks like one of the old rental syndications, grainy and old. No trailers or extras but that would be ok if the picture were better. Anyone know if the other versions have cleaned it up?",1240876800,2,257,4.26530612244898
1080241,3,6305827648,"Another reviewer has already given a good overview of the plot of the movie, I just wanted to add a few comments. No, there is never actually any coffin anywhere in the movie so I have to wonder where the title came from. I assume anyone reading this review is old school like me and already appreciated these kind of well-made thrillers back when they were 10 years old and actually thought they were really scary. This is one you'd definitely have seen on Thriller Theater on Saturday afternoons back in the 70's and early 80's, and it would have been considered one of the better ones. This one is easily better made than say, ""The Terror"" or 'The Dunwich Horror', but maybe not quite as good as say, ""Five million years to Earth"". It still has a good story, though, and sticks to it. No blood all over the walls and no guy with a giant knife slashing peoples' heads off for fun. No stupid subplots or bad acting either. I write this review now because at current age 36 I just saw this yesterday for the first time and it fit right in to the memories I have of watching those other great British Horror films I used to get really into as a child and young teenager. So check this one out, you can't beat the price on it right now either.",1240185600,2,1241,4.285106382978723
1080242,3,6305827648,"Considering the quality (or lack of) on most of their product, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the Alpha DVD of DR. BLOOD'S COFFIN is a very nice transfer with good color and sound. If only some of their other stuff looked this good! This is well worth the money if you want to add this title to your horror movie collection.",1238371200,4,337,4.365079365079365
1080243,5,6305827648,"Dr. Peter Blood (Kieron Moore from Day Of The Triffids) returns to the tiny village of his youth, in order to fulfill his dream of re-animating the dead. Alas, the town-folk aren't very understanding, forcing Blood to operate in secrecy. Thankfully, the cops are incompetent boobs who cannot fathom why people just keep vanishing and / or turning up dead. The loverly Hazel Court plays a nurse, and Ian Hunter is Dr. Blood's dad. DBC is a gruesome little chiller w/ a snappy zombie-rises-to-seek-revenge final. Great stuff...",1230336000,2,525,5.045977011494253
1080244,3,6305827648,"Dr. Peter Blood (no relation to Captain) has a problem. His name makes it obvious he's the villain. But I jest; certainly his is a convenient moniker, at least for horror movie purposes, with Frankenstein being taken, but since the people in this movie are quite thick-headed his secret stays safe for a long time. His real problem is that he has discovered a way to bring the dead back to life, and cannot make the simpletons around him see that it is okay for him to vivisect living humans to gain the parts he needs.
He returns to his childhood home on the English coast, after being kicked out of medical school in Vienna for his grisly dealings. His town has been wracked with disappearances and thefts over the past while, and the audience knows Blood has been doing it, because the opening scene showed him to be a madman. Yet for a few minutes the filmmakers hide his face as if this movie is going to be a mystery. Apparently news of his transgressions at school did not make it back home, because he is welcomed with open arms. He promptly pitches in on trying to locate the fiend, while simultaneously using his medical knowledge and good reputation to lead the authorities astray, as well as romancing the beguilingly beautiful Hazel Court, a nurse in his father's clinic. We instinctively know all this hard work is going to catch up to Blood, because, well, he's a crazed villain. And besides, you're just not supposed to date your co-workers.
Anyway, Blood dispatches a few more villagers, is nearly discovered when one crawls away and barely lacks the strength to ID him, is discovered, kills one more, is discovered again, by Hazel, and races off to the cave where he has been keeping his still-living victims and performing his experiments.
If the flick hasn't been exactly bad up to this point, but merely pokey and obvious, here's where it gets good. He finally succeeds in his experiment, transplanting a still-beating heart into Hazel's dead husband's corpse. This he does to spite her for rejecting his creepy advances. Talk about holding a grudge. The moldy stiff gets up and attacks Hazel. The cops seem to have stopped for tea on the way, and are nowhere to be found, as the undead fiend from heck menaces our heroine. But Blood, in a fit of conscience(?), stops the thing and fights with it himself. For a dead guy, Hazel's ex sure can scrap. Not that we can see much in the sloppily-directed Toho-esque elbows-and-angles style bout. At any rate, his transplanted heart must have been like a diesel engine, because the rotting man manages to strangle Blood. Then he expires himself, for some unknown reason. Hazel stumbles out of the cave, to the police, who act like they had intended to storm the cave but had experienced car troubles.
That is a happy ending, I suppose, although I still don't know where the titular Coffin of Dr. Blood fits into the story. That seems a more fitting title for any eventual sequel. But I digress.
Kieron Moore does well as Dr. Blood, but looks vaguely like a somewhat handsomer Cosmo Kramer, spoiling his manic performance a trifle. Hazel Court does very well just being Hazel Court. Her uncredited dead husband looks suitably grody.
But the story's pacing and seen-it-all-before nature hurt. The modern setting didn't help, either; there's a lot less mystique to the 1960's than to the 1860's. With phones in existence, why didn't someone from Vienna warn the town a dangerous mad scientist was on his way? And how did Blood beat Hazel and the cops back to the cave by enough of a margin to complete open-heart surgery? In horse-and-buggy days, I might have overlooked it, but in Volkswagen times, that plot convenience sticks out sorely.
The print is surprisingly good for a company that allows typos on the box and cannot be bothered to get their brief synopsis correct.
In summation, I've made much sport of this movie, and it is funny in a dry way, but it's mostly well-done and I do recommend it for genre fans.

7895652,2,6305827648,"This movie is lacking in excitement and suffers from a poor script. Very little action and not a very interesting story. However, it is an early movie dealing with the living dead for fan's of that genre. Doctor Blood is essentially trying to bring back the dead so it can also be viewed as a Frankenstein type of movie.

The DVD quality is decent but I would recommend this movie only for collectors of zombie, living dead, Frankenstein movies.",1439510400,,445,4.632911392405063

Cornish scenery and a mad performance from Kieron Moore plus scream queen Hazel Court make it a fun purchase for fans of 60s horror.",1438300800,,296,4.120689655172414
7895654,5,6305827648,"A good old fashinon horror movie only this time in color. It is a short movie as movies go, but the action is ongoing throughtout the movie. It has a good plot with good acting. The movie has been remastered therefore the picture and sound is very good. Not a lot of gore and blood which is good. This is the old school type movie where you get to use your mind and stay on the edge of your seat wondering what the outcome is to be. You will have a lot of information to process. A lot of fine looking older British cars to look at also. Not a bad horror movie for the 60s when the gore and blood had become the thing of which horror movies were made and I am sad to say remains the same today. A good horror movie should have as much mystery as possible and this one is full of well placed mystery. I'll take the mystery over the blood and gore every time.",1415577600,2,857,3.988372093023256

7895656,2,6305827648,"** This review may contain spoilers ***

Tedious flick about a dumb doctor who experiments with the dead.  The whole of his time is spent by wandering around the countryside doing nothing at all. The doctor smokes in every scene and seems like a real dullard.  Nothing is exciting at all.  There's a nice monster at the end and a good 'behind shot' of Hazel Court as Nurse Linda Parker but that's it.",1402358400,,400,4.438356164383562
7895657,5,6305827648,"Pretty good early 60's British horror film.  A medical student (or resident, I'm not sure) is kicked out of the hospital where he is practicing for unethical medical experiments.  He goes back to the seaside small town where his dad is the country doctor and pretty soon villagers start disappearing.  The mad med student sets up his experimental lab in the abandoned mines under the village and takes his lab humans there.  What's awful is that he operates on the victims while they are still alive and aware.  He paralyzes them with curare but that's small comfort.  He sort of falls for his dad's practice nurse and when she rejects him he brings her dead hubby, who's been gone three years, back to life for her.  Naturally she wants nothing to do with her crusty, moldy spouse.  That's when everything hits the fan.  Nicely filmed at a beautiful seaside area (not sure where) in England.  The quality of the MGM Limited Edition is great and probably as good as it will ever get.  Recommended for British horror film fans.",1401580800,7,1026,4.675977653631285
7895658,4,6305827648,"Back in my formative years, one of my local TV stations (out of 3) had a penchant for British horror movies and ran them all the time. In addition to Hammer & Amicus, the two largest companies, there were a number of others who tried their hand at making horror pictures. There was Anglo-Amalgamated (CIRCUS OF HORRORS, HORRORS OF THE BLACK MUSEUM, PEEPING TOM), Baker & Berman (BLOOD OF THE VAMPIRE, FLESH & THE FIENDS, JACK THE RIPPER), and later on Tigon (BLOOD ON SATAN'S CLAW, CURSE OF THE CRIMSON ALTAR, WITCHFINDER GENERAL). There were also a number of smaller companies who made a couple of titles and one of those companies, Caralan, made two films back to back in 1961. One was THE SNAKE WOMAN (an interesting failure), the other was DR BLOOD'S COFFIN which turned into another childhood favorite.

There were a number of reasons for this, the chief reason was that it starred Kieron Moore who I had just seen on the big screen as the heavy in one of my favorite Disney movies, DARBY O'GILL & THE LITTLE PEOPLE and as a lighthouse keeper in THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS, a seminal viewing experience which cemented my preference for Brit movies (years later I would see Moore as Vronsky with Vivien Leigh in my favorite version of ANNA KARENINA). Another was that, even as a child,  I preferred the straight-faced approach typical of British horror films in a modern setting as opposed to the quick, in-your-face style of American B movies. This understated approach to the highly dubious scenario in DR BLOOD'S COFFIN made it believable and once you buy into it, then the circumstances that occur and the gruesome finale take on really horrific overtones.

In brief, a Cornwall native is thrown out of medical school in Vienna for his radical ideas on heart transplants (remember this is 1961) and he returns to his hometown. The native, Dr Peter Blood (Moore), is a personable young man whose father is the local town doctor. In his employ as a nurse is a pretty young widow (Hazel Court) who takes a liking to Peter. Soon local townspeople start disappearing and strange goings on are happening in the nearby abandoned tin mines. Dr Blood is now ready for his grand scheme, bringing the dead back to life through heart transplants starting with Court's husband. I know it's an absurd premise but with that willing suspension of disbelief so necessary for horror movies, it works. This DVD-R, which utilizes a beautiful, proper ratio print, easily bests any other version out there so make sure to look for the MGM Limited Edition.",1383868800,4,2538,4.737556561085973
