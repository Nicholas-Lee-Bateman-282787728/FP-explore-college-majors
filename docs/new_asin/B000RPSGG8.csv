2874669,4,B000RPSGG8,"As a long time fan of Gale Harold's, it's been a privilege to watch him develop into an amazing actor.

And quite fascinating to watch Mr. Harold portray a racist, confederate flag waving redneck, since the film character represents the polar opposite of Mr. Harold's personal views.

Powerful story, beautiful cinematography. Would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for Michelle Clunie's somewhat over-the-top performance.",1183161600,13,425,5.424242424242424

2874671,4,B000RPSGG8,"I saw The Unseen at the Denver Film Festival years ago.  I followed Gale Harold through Queer as Folk, picked up Wake, an excellent portrayal by him, and Particles of Truth.  Each one a story about damaged people.  Each about the interactions of the main characters who hide in one way or another.

As other reviewers  have stated, The Unseen is not a feel good movie, however, it will stay with you long after the last frame appears on screen. Introducing three characters who are childhood friends and  the southern town  where they live, or don't live,  makes  you wonder just how this story of blindness and not just of the eyes, prejudice, and not just racial, and transformation of the three main characters, whose lives have interwoven beyond the limits of their town, came to be. The settings become characters that exert an influence far beyond what you'd expect.

It will leave you pondering for a long time about the characters, the setting and the film.  The direction is well done, the script excellent, the acting also, and the interaction, as it builds with the three main characters, is well worth the wait for the stunning climax. I found the film real which is my test for a good movie.  See it.

It's hard for me to say more about the plot without giving too much away. I was stunned when the lights came up in the theater and continued that way for a few days after when I thought of the film.

What I found the most profound about the film is the interaction and influence each of the characters have on one another, and what one event in a life can do to the people who experience it. The ensemble acting, the minor characters are wonderfully portrayed and made in a very short time, it far surpasses the time it took to film it.

Just writing this review makes me want to see it again, even though I wasn't sure I would. Read the other reviews to find out about the plot.",1264377600,,1894,4.449275362318841
2874672,4,B000RPSGG8,"A movie starring no one I'd ever heard of, written by an unknown, and directed by an unknown.  I rented it on an impulse on one of those days when nothing seemed available at the video store....and am so glad I did.

From an opening sequence suggesting that the ending is a foregone conclusion to the introduction of characters who make intense first impressions as two-dimensional stereotypes, ""The Unseen"" gradually shifts to a tension-filled tale packed with character study and action often as much psychological as physical.  The plot moves more or less methodically, gathering in strength and intensity as it leads to its climax (a few murky moments are my only quibble).  Tension builds, matters come to a head....and when the payoff comes, it's most definitely Not What It Seems time.  Expect a couple of surprises, perhaps more, depending on how much thought you've given to each character.  None, it seems, are what the viewer has assumed they were through the entire film....a truly eerie experience which remains with me long after the final fadeout.  As to what ""The Unseen"" is....well, you'll see...or perhaps not.

This is not a ""happily ever after"" movie--indeed, the ending leaves several matters troublingly (and possibly deliberately) unresolved.  There are a few echoes of William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren, but this is very much a story of the here and now, a tale of the prejudices of its audience as much as those of its characters.  If you let them get in the way, chances are you won't get through this film--and that would be a true shame.

No director in recent memory has accomplished so much with a camera, simple location filming and perhaps a dozen actors.  A monument perhaps to the power of economy in the hands of a capable artist.",1217289600,10,1771,4.866666666666666
2874673,4,B000RPSGG8,"I got this movie because Gale Harold was in it :-)  I thought the movie was good overall, but I didn't like the ending.",1203292800,,119,3.9583333333333335
2874674,5,B000RPSGG8,"I bought The Unseen, only because Gale Harold was in it.  I am a HUGE fan of his!  But I was pleasantly surprised at just how good this film was.  My hat is off to Lisa France for direction.  Well done!  Gale Harold did an awesome job with his character, Harold.  I have rednecks in my family, dated them and even married one.  So I know a redneck when I see one!  Gale had it down perfect.  The most PHENOMENAL acting goes to Phillip Bloch!  I was blown away with his performance!  He was hilarious trying to climb out the window!  It must have been somewhat difficult playing blind and keeping his eyes rolled up in his head like that.  Michelle Clunie, in MHO did an excellent job as well.  Several other reviewers said she was 'too over the top'.  I thought she did great.  And with Michelle and Gale both being on Queer as Folk, I saw not one tiny trace, what-so-ever, of Mel and Brian.  They put those characters on the shelf, and played two, new characters, totally different and refreshing.  I am glad I bought this DVD for my ever growing collection.",1202860800,7,1059,4.343589743589743

2874676,5,B000RPSGG8,"I ordered this movie for a friend of mine for Christmas.  She watched it ON DEMAND on TV and wanted to buy it, but Blockbuster, Movie Gallery and other stores in our area did not have it to rent or sale.  She went on Amazon and found it.  I ordered 2, one for her and one for me. It is a great movie.  The service at Amazon was also excellent. Thanks for everything.",1200096000,,366,3.9726027397260273

8202262,4,B000RPSGG8,"Not a great film, but a good film overall.  The plot deals with how people can misinterpret what they think they saw, and
how this can affect them and others for their entire lives.  This is one of those films where past secrets are revealed at
the end that explain the motivations of the characters that may seem strange when first viewed.  Powerful ending to a
rather slow moving film overall.",1353715200,,395,4.535211267605634
8202263,5,B000RPSGG8,"Bought this movie as I am a fan of GALE HAROLD.  WoW!  what a powerful story.  Gale was so well cast in this roleas he is such an intense actor.  Sad story - nobody won in the end but, as with his Queer as Folk role, Gale was not afraid to take on a difficult topic.  It was funny to see Michelle Clunie acting with him in a totally different roll.  The other actors made this whole story believeable.  I found myself laughing in some parts and actually crying in others.  I would recommend you buy but be warned the topic of child abuse is not for everyone.",1316476800,2,558,4.101851851851852
8202264,2,B000RPSGG8,"There isn't enough worthwhile substance to rescue this amateurish attempt at filmmaking. The intriguing, if somewhat cliche, storyline does little to disguise the blemishes and flaws in this movie. The major downfalls are the awkward and choppy scriptwriting and directing.

In general, the character progression is unbelievable, exhibiting little to no natural transition from emotion to emotion during pivotal scenes. On the other hand, the acting is decent, but also suffers from the poor writing and direction. As the product of this, you end up with a movie that you don't want to watch but you want to know what happens at the end.

I would NOT recommend this film unless you have an affinity for bad southern gothics or a vested interest in Gale Harold's career.

DO NOT watch this movie if you're looking for gay or lesbian characters; it only touches upon gay themes.",1297900800,,876,4.986301369863014
