3702633,5,B001MXZ61M,"I saw this video to teach citizen volunteers about the aquatic invertebrates that we use to monitor stream quality, before actually going to a stream to search for these creatures.  It really got them excited about ""bugs"" (which can be challenging)!  As an entomologist, I was very pleased with the quality of the footage and accuracy of the information. I even learned a few new things! Even though the intended audience is anglers, this video is suitable for general naturalist education, too, for all ages.",1238198400,10,509,4.976470588235294
3702634,4,B001MXZ61M,Useful to see what the bugs look like. I found it useful to see that dead drifting is only one strategy - nymphs can be very active. And how shiny a nymph with an air bubble can be.,1234051200,,181,3.789473684210526
3702635,5,B001MXZ61M,The under water photography was spectacular. The time invested in getting those scenes on video must have been long and difficult.,1377475200,,130,5.238095238095238
3702636,5,B001MXZ61M,"Excellent videos of aquatic insects and their life cycle.  I'm a beginner, so this is teaching me alot about what to look for on the water when I'm out searching dor trout.",1361836800,,172,4.375
3702637,5,B001MXZ61M,This movie will definitely help improve your fishing! It really helps you understand what the fish see and how to fish patterns.,1336003200,,128,4.863636363636363
3702638,2,B001MXZ61M,"The video is billed as: ""11 years, 8 cameras, 3 countries, countless breaths underwater.""  I would add ... and 27 minutes of video about underwater bugs.  Actually, the entire DVD runs for 37 minutes, but if you deduct the introductions by both authors, and the oft repeated video images, there is about 27 minutes of unrepeated underwater video.

I enjoyed what I saw, but in no way was the 27 minutes of underwater video worth what I had to pay, especially since parts of this video are available for free on Youtube.

I'm a real fan of Ralph Cutter's book, ""Fish Food.""  He is a great author and knows his bugs.  That is why I bought the DVD.  But the DVD was a great disappointment to me for the reasons stated.",1335916800,3,715,4.412213740458015
3702639,4,B001MXZ61M,"This is probably a very good video for people who want to understand fishing better.  I purchased it because I saw it running at a fishing show and loved the way it reveals the life cycles of insects, who for part of their lives, live underwater.  I wanted to share this with children I work with.  The photography is great.",1334275200,,324,4.366666666666666
3702640,4,B001MXZ61M,I work in the field of water resources protection and am always looking for good images/information about aquatic insects to share with young and old.  This will be a great complement to my existing resources.  I would give it 5 stars if it had a bit more information about some of the critters and included dragonflies.  But I also understand how hard it is to balance the amount of information with the attention-span of most viewers.  Good resource for the price.  EXCELLENT underwater shots.,1327881600,,495,4.845238095238095
3702641,5,B001MXZ61M,This is a great...great video if you're looking to become a better fly fisherman. It shows how the aquatic insects move in the water.  It shows how they exit the water.  This must have been difficult to accomplish.  I've watched it numerous times.  Pretty amazing footage of some very tiny creatures.,1319068800,3,300,4.823529411764706
3702642,5,B001MXZ61M,This DVD shows what some of the common Bugs look like underwater.  Some of the information could have been gained by an observant fisherman on the stream but on the stream there is no repetitive playback of the observation.  Very helpful for flytyers.,1317513600,,251,4.813953488372093
3702643,5,B001MXZ61M,"After reading the Cutter's ""Fish Food"" I purchased their Bugs of the Underworld DVD.
WOW!! The whole thing is filmed in natural settings - mostly from underwater. Mayflies, stoneflies, caddisflies, midges and damsel fly life cycles are filmed in their entirety. With very tight and crisp focus you watch their movements and behavior. Filming, editing, narration and music is of highest professional quality (according to the cover David Attenborough gave it a rave review). The most dramatic footage is of the many insects swimming to the surface, emerging through the water and flying away - from an underwater point of view. Invaluable tool for fly tiers and fisherman trying to imitate aquatic insects.
Not only informative but entertaining. My kids have watched it to the point of memorizing the script. My only complaint is that I wish I had been aware of the video 2 years ago when it came out.

3702644,5,B001MXZ61M,"The images in this video are not only fascinating, the knowledge of the behavior of common ""trout food"" items to be gained from studying the film is invaluable to the fisherman and fly-tier.  No need to describe the video to you, just check out the free sample video on the website.  Check it out!",1256169600,2,297,4.481481481481482
8322368,5,B001MXZ61M,"If you are looking at this DVD and reviews right now, you need this DVD...PROMISE!",1501286400,,82,4.533333333333333
8322369,4,B001MXZ61M,Audio could be better.  But great underwater footage and bug closeups.,1492732800,,70,5.363636363636363
8322370,5,B001MXZ61M,"Fantastic look at aquatic bugs as they go from one stage of development to the next, followed by mating and laying eggs. If you really want to know what action to impart on your flies, this video is for you.",1467072000,,207,4.2
8322371,5,B001MXZ61M,This is a great addition to my library.  I will be using it in a class I am teaching.  Great underwater photography.,1456185600,,116,4.2272727272727275
8322372,4,B001MXZ61M,I use this video in my Environmental Science classes at Niskayuna High School.  We collect BMI from a local stream in order to conduct a bio-assessment of the water quality.  This video gives the students an opportunity to see the BMI in their natural environment.  Excellent underwater action!,1447632000,,294,5.083333333333333
8322373,5,B001MXZ61M,An amazing video! Tons of food for thought! Change the way you think about bugs and the way you fish them.,1442275200,,106,4.095238095238095
8322374,2,B001MXZ61M,"this documentary series had excellent shots/footage, however, the dialog was recorded a bit crumy and boring. The dvd only had information about 6 different macro invertabrates, this would have been fine if they'd spend a bit more time on each one..but they leave you wanting more.
it was certainly not worth 30 dollars. its great for a 6 dollar film. its too bad because the world needs a good documentary about these fasinating larval stages.",1418860800,,444,4.933333333333334
8322375,5,B001MXZ61M,great watching for any Fly Fisherman.,1417219200,,37,5.333333333333333
8322376,5,B001MXZ61M,Amazing video.  The picture quality is awesome.  I've watched this video more times than I can remember.  I purchased this video after an instructor at a fly tying class showed it.  This video shows insects emerging from the bottom to the top of the water column.  It has really helped me with my presentation of different fly patterns.  Has really increased my understanding of what goes on below the surface.,1405036800,,410,4.785714285714286
8322377,3,B001MXZ61M,"This DVD has some interesting camera shots of bugs from the fishes point of view, but it seems to be short with a lot of the same shots over and over again. There is some useful information here, but slim at best. They really just go into detail on a few bugs. I am a little upset I spent the $30 or so on it.",1385251200,,309,3.769230769230769
