7902893,5,B000003KA3,"I really enjoyed this episode of Voyager and think that it is one of the key episodes of season two.
In this episode, former Voyager crew member and ""all-around evil one"" Seska reappears with the Kazon - and they are bent on taking over Voyager and stealing the Starfleet technology contained therein.  Of course, Janeway and crew go through some action-packed moments during their ensuing struggle with the Kazon...but another plot layer involves the personal betrayal felt by Commander Chakotay, who had recruited Seska and been her captain during her time in the Maquis.
I like the way the writers juiced up this episode: in 46 minutes, this episode develops a major second season storyline, gives us lots of action, and gives us some excellent insight into the character of Chakotay.  Plus, it gave us about a million reasons to develop a healthy hatred of Seska - the primary ""villan"" of season two.  Not bad for a single episode!
I give this episode 5 stars and consider it a ""must see"" among season two Voyager episodes.",995414400,2,1027,4.823863636363637
7902894,5,B000003KA3,"Kazon forces attack Voyager capturing a vital piece of technology that unites the sects and who is master mind behind this strategy?????
You guessed it, our favorite traitor, Seska. You know...... the ex Voyager crew member who was a former Maquis, disguised as a Bajoran , who really is Cardassian spy...Yeah, Seska  and she is EVIL...Oh yes.... A great villain.  Did I mention she's Chakotay's ex flame???? She's back.
Chakotay takes all of this very personally and sets out to recover the technology, alone and soon he finds himself in the hands of the enemy.
The action is great and tensions are high. A plot driven episode with plenty of  ""maneuvering"" going on.
A 5 out of 5",972777600,6,680,4.745762711864407
