4663112,4,B005DVIPNU,"I liked this series when it originally aired on TV, aso I was very pleased to have a copy on DVD to watch whenever I wanted it. The series is a bit dated and a few episodes aren't as good as others, but it is very quirky and British and reminds me of life in simplier, happier times. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys class British sitcoms from the 70s and 80s.",1364342400,,369,4.0
4663113,4,B005DVIPNU,"I can't truthfully say that Fresh Fields is my favorite Britcom, but it is funny, and the married couple and her mom are very engaging. Not sure now why I purchased Set 2 and not 1, but now I do plan to buy Set 1 and complete the series. It's very entertaining and I know I'll sit down and watch it again.",1357516800,,305,3.935483870967742

4663115,5,B005DVIPNU,I have thoroughly enjoyed this program in the past and love it the second time around. I highly recommend it for laughs.,1354838400,,120,4.5
4663116,5,B005DVIPNU,I love this series.  Is is simple but that is what I like about it.  I highly recommend.  I can't wait to get French Fields.,1324944000,,124,3.88
4663117,4,B005DVIPNU,"While I totally agree with all that has been previously mentioned in other reviews, I found it a bit disappointing that Acorn did not include in either Set 1 or Set 2 the Fresh Fields Christmas Special 'A Dickens of a Christmas'.  This hilarious 35-minute episode is one of my favorites from the series and, for me personally, my favorite British Christmas Sitcom Special.

Here's hoping that Acorn either does an updated DVD release, or release this episode on its own.",1321488000,9,470,4.790123456790123
4663118,5,B005DVIPNU,"We love watch this older TV program.  It's got clean dialog and can make one laugh a lot.  We bought Seasons 1&2 a few months ago and could hardly wait for this one, Seasons 3 & 4.  I just hope we don't have to wait as long for French Fields which is the sequel where the Fields move to France. Other than being in England this could be a neighbor in any town on earth.  It has a good story line and is fun too watch.",1318982400,6,417,3.813953488372093
4663119,3,B005DVIPNU,"James A. Stewart, DVD Verdict --It's pretty much a sitcom, decent enough but less modern and edgy than the Hancock's Half-Hour episodes from the 1950s I've heard online, let alone Spaced. Basically, silly situations are interrupted by neighbors--in this case, mooching Sonia, mother-in-law Nancy (Fanny Rowe, The Forsythe Saga), and Nancy's ex with a wandering eye (Ballard Berkeley, Fawlty Towers)--turning up to quip or get splashed with water or something.

The scripts, all written by John Chapman, are hit-and-miss, often relying on naughty bits, both double entendres (on fixing the bedroom: ""I think it's high time we had a change."" ""Good idea. Anyone in mind?"") and William's occasional (Groucho) Marxist joking about polygamy or adultery. The episodes also tend to be disjointed, with little continuity. In ""Life is Full of Ups and Downs,"" William's concerned about financial reversals, but the problem is forgotten by episode's end. Some bits are familiar; I'd just seen the closing gag in ""Ups and Downs"" in Genevieve, a 1950s British movie I'd reviewed for DVD Verdict. A plot twist involving Nancy is just thrown in abruptly at the end of ""Happy Returns."" The show at times feels as plotless as Mr. Bean, only with lots of dialogue and not quite as funny.

At the same time, each episode had at least one bit that made me laugh out loud. Anton Rodgers and Julia McKenzie are excellent comedians, and when there's a good gag, it's really, really good. They also share a chemistry that could leave you thinking they were really married and always come across as a loving couple, even if they're always sparring over something and William is constantly calling his wife ""barmy.""

The picture isn't bad for episodes that are around a quarter-century old, although there are flecks (Acorn really should have fixed up the ones in the titles) and some flaring in outdoor videotaping that was probably bad in the first place. The sound fares well. Dialogue is clear, and the theme rendition of ""Pick Yourself Up"" comes across brassy without being annoying.

Bios of the stars are the only extras.

4663120,5,B005DVIPNU,"Funny mid-life couple yet in love, not badgering each other, and back in a 2nd DVD set. As good as Set 1 (see my review). Wm & Hester go about their day, he an accountant, she always trying a new creative endeavor. Viewers any age will enjoy these mated mates. Hester (Julia McKenzie-`Miss Marple' `Cranford') creates the plots with her activity adventures. William (Anton Rodgers-`Lillie' `Dirty Rotten Scoundrels' `Affairs of the Heart' `Noah's Ark') saves her, gets en-snarled, or plays along. Each episode ends in a surprise laugh. Neighbor Sonja (Ann Beach) now noted for her line ""It's only Sonja""; and Hester's mom, Nancy (Fanny Rowe) who lives in the granny house out back, add spark, humor, and the odd situation. And the dirty old man, Nancy's divorced husband, Guy (Ballard Berkeley) is forever seeking a remarriage, or another girl to flirt with, which caused the divorce in the first place. Family friendly.

All 14 episodes DO HAVE SDH SUBTITLES.
Set 2 is actually Seasons 3 & 4 (Set one was seasons 1 & 2). From here the show changed, but the 2 stars came back for 3 more seasons in a newest series ""French Fields"". Maybe we'll get lucky and that will someday be on DVD as well.
