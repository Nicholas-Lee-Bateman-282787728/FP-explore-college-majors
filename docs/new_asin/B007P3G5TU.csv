8520070,1,B007P3G5TU,"Gee, near a primer for a 5th grade student. I found this entire series not to be the quality of HIstory Chanel and already knew more than presented in 5 discs equaling 12 hours of my time. So basic, nothing to ponder. Waste of time and money",1373587200,,241,4.148936170212766

8520072,4,B007P3G5TU,"All in all, i enjoyed this whole set. The only complaint i had was that almost every disc mentioned murder inc., but it did not have its own disc. There was also way too many repeats about the valentine's day massacre. But it was worth it alone for the section of mob wives, and the sad legacy of the gambino family.",1357257600,3,316,4.19672131147541

8520074,5,B007P3G5TU,"What you get with this package is the best A&E production of The Mafia at a much better price.  The first five episodes are a reprint of an early 2001 production of ""The History of the Mob in America""
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mafia-The-History-of-the-Mob-in-America/dp/B00005AA9C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mafia - The History of the Mob in America</a>&nbsp;which alone is worth the price of admission.  (The section on ""Kennedy and the Mob"" gives convincing evidence that the Mob killed the president.)  This work shows that the mob worked in the shadows of many otherwise creditable people:  fishermen and crabbers off the South Jersey Shore, truckers and anyone else suffering during the depression.  Not all mobsters were Sicilian, though.  Many early mobsters were Jewish and Irish as well.

For a few bucks more you get three times the hours with additional focus on more detailed topics of specific mobsters and other dubious characters, all taken from A&E productions such as ""American Justice"", ""Investigating History"" and other 50-minute specials dealing with the mob.  There is some repetition here with the newer series, as well as a few cheesy reenactments the History Channel is famous for, but you get more detail with each additional production.

The documentaries are from old news footage, staged governmental videos made in Hollywood (common in the 1930s-1950s) and more recent videos.  It covers over a century of gangs, mobs and other lovely criminals.

The five DVDs are packed into one video case, making for a more condensed package.  Between this edition and the older 2001 version, I'd pick this one.",1290124800,25,1671,5.509803921568627
