7289117,5,B00ZR3W3WI,My 2 1/2 year old daughter got this for Christmas. She loves Thomas has wanted to see this movie. Unfortunately she hasn't seemed extremely interested in the movie but I think that's her age rather than the quality of the movie. I found it to be cute and maybe more appropriate for a 3-4 year old.,1517011200,,297,4.321428571428571

Have some fun songs and okay lessons for kids included, Thomas the Tank engine is the best... and baby agrees",1510790400,,143,4.5
7289131,1,B00ZR3W3WI,"This was horrible.  Truly horrible.  We are Thomas fans and this was awful.  Thomas is CLEARLY in the wrong any number of times in the show, but never actually admits failing or doing wrong - even when essentially caught in the act.  Sir Topham Hat is a terrible manager, failing to get the root of his yard's problems.  The pirate is ridiculous and a bit scary.  Goodness...I could go on, but I don't want to dwell on this movie any longer.
Skip it.",1510185600,4,450,4.36144578313253

7289133,5,B00ZR3W3WI,"This is the best Thomas Movie Ever! This was an awesome movie and so action packed. The only minor flaw is that Sir Topham Hatt is too harsh on Thomas. Other than that this movie is perfect. The songs are great and many characters returned like Donald, Douglas, Daisy, Alfie, and Oliver. Rex, Mike and Bert are great characters and there song is one of the best songs of the show and the other song was great. The new characters Ryan and Skiff are great and Sailor John was the best new character and a great villain for the movie. The Marion subplot was funny and the chase between Thomas and Sailor John is Fantastic and Wonderful. Overall this is the best the movie ever! I highly recommend this action packed movie.",1505606400,,719,4.454545454545454

7289151,4,B00ZR3W3WI,"My toddler loved watching this movie.  He kept trying to name all the engines as they came on the screen.  Currently, a screen time of 126 minutes is a bit too long for him; he kept getting distracted away from the movie.  So we have to watch it in 15 to 20 minute spurts.

7289175,2,B00ZR3W3WI,My 5 yr old (and I) did not like how Thomas' character was poor and unrepentant. He treats the other engines poorly and yet does not explicitly apologize. We ended up turning it off half way through with my son very upset.,1471132800,,222,4.309523809523809

Some parts might be a little scary depending on your child, as there are some parts that take place in dark places, but my son wasn't scared at all.

7289192,4,B00ZR3W3WI,"This occupied my Thomas-obsessed 2 year old on our flight recently, he watched it multiple times. The movie is a perfect length for little viewers, about an hour, and features many new trains. The story itself is a little darker than normal Thomas shows (!) with an actual villain in this movie, but my son still enjoyed it tremendously and sings all the songs now.",1466985600,5,365,4.630769230769231

A pirate who is clearly a bad guy, I thought, but my 4 year old thought was the hero of the story. (He goes to jail at the end...maybe he's wrongly accused?) Good songs. Good CGI rendering.

7289251,5,B00ZR3W3WI,"The previous movie to this one, Tales of the Brave, was I would say 'scary' to the intended target primarily from the visual scenes, and while our son likes the characters, will all but refuse to watch that movie, which was a big change from all of the previous movies.

This one, with I would say a slightly more menacing to my adult eyes, adjusted the visual scenes to be less menacing to the child's eyes and so he likes this one much better. It features an even more over the top plot involving yet another cave-in, a pirate ship and treasure, and a skiff converted to use wind power on the rails -- but somehow keeps that Thomas magic. Our son will probably age out of Thomas after another movie or two, so hopefully they can keep up the good work.",1455062400,,753,4.302816901408451
7289252,2,B00ZR3W3WI,This movie really scared my son who loves Thomas. It was rather dark for a kids movie. My son is sensitive to scary/dark cartoons but I thought this wasn't necessary. We will not be watching it again. I am disappointed.,1454889600,,219,4.5

7289256,5,B00ZR3W3WI,"What better way to celebrate the 70th Anniversary of the whole franchise then to introduce RWS characters into the current incarnation of the series (the Small Railway and the actual creator himself making an easter egg appearance), having old returnees return in this special (Donald, Douglas, Daisy, Alfie, Oliver-the Pack, Max, and Monty), having an orchestra take part alongside the current composers of the series, and references from the classic series shown here in this special? I'm pretty much sold on this special!

I would pretty much recommend this to any new fan of Thomas or to the kids that are now young adults who grew up with this show back in the day. It's amazing to see how far this series came, and I'm glad I'm part of this world. Happy (belated) 70th Anniversary to Thomas and Friends. :)",1454284800,,812,4.8

Thomas behaved very badly but then never really came to the realization to turn around his behavior like he usually does. He was aggressive and downright mean to the other engines. For instance, Thomas stole Gordon's express carts, accidently pushed them into a great big hole int he ground, but then just fussed about how Sir Toppom hat took Thomas off his branch line. Thomas never showed remorse for what he did and just continued with haughty behavior throughout the movie.  Percy and the normal engines you see were not really in this movie either.  The story just seemed to want to introduce as many new engines as possible  (my guess is for merchandising purposes).",1446595200,11,792,4.844444444444444

7289319,3,B00ZR3W3WI,"Three stars because my 3 year old loves it, but I'm noticing a trend in the newer Thomas movies that I feel is...unnecessary?  Thomas has always been a mellow, low drama show that attempts to teach social lessons without using Bad Guys or violence, and that was a perfectly fine formula, especially for toddlers and preschoolers.  In the last few years the movies have become more dramatic and, well, scary.  My kid won't even watch Tale of the Brave, he saw it twice when it came out like two years ago and he's STILL too scared of it to watch it.  This new movie was scary at times also, and we were able to help him through it, but I never thought I would say ""Wow, this Thomas is too scary.""

The problem is that there are years and years of the old school format that have instilled a connection, like a bond that young kids have with these characters.  My kid is all Thomas, all the time.  So when you start making the movies more dramatic and scarier they really are scared for these characters they are attached to.  It's not cool.  I could see the makers attempting to age-up their product to increase sales by making Thomas more relevant to the school-age group, but you are forgetting your major fan-base here, and it's vulnerable 2 to 4 year olds who don't need the drama and evil nemesis, they need the old format.",1444867200,35,1327,4.405737704918033
7289320,5,B00ZR3W3WI,WOW!!!! What an incredibly pleasant Thomas adventure!! My son loved it and I venture to say I loved it just as much.

7289372,3,B00ZR3W3WI,"With new voices for most characters, there has also been a natural move in the storyline. Many new characters which have not been seen in the CGI show are present, but the story is a mixed bag.

7289374,3,B00ZR3W3WI,"I will start by saying that I own, and have repeatedly watched, every Thomas movie that exists.  I have also seen just about every episode of the TV show - including the originals.  This one is, by far, among the worst of the bunch.  Talk about reaching just to sell merchandise!  There is a SAIL boat on wheels (who doesn't like to get his face wet), helmed by a no-good treasure hunter (who skulks on land via the rails at night), and Thomas himself spends the first half of the movie being far whinier and more petulant than ever before.

In no way do I expect this series to be realistic, but come on!  This one was pretty out there - in a ridiculously disappointing way.  I'm still not even 100% sure what the actual main idea of the story was with so much nonsense going on.  Overall, I think there were far more possibilities with regard to story lines involving pirate treasure than were reflected here.  It seems like a bunch of hacks got together and threw a bunch of silly ideas out - and then went with all of them simultaneously.

I will say that my 3 year old didn't seem to mind the outlandish story line as much as I did, which is the ONLY reason for 3 stars, but she also didn't seem engaged by the story.  The only thing she took away from the whole thing was that she thought Skiff (the aforementioned sail boat) was kind of neat...mostly because he was a boat (like Captain).",1443398400,5,1395,4.306513409961686

7289395,1,B00ZR3W3WI,"All 3 of my kids are Thomas fans and we have always looked forward to new Thomas movies. This was the biggest disappointment we have ever had. Thomas is rude, Sir Topham Hat is impatient and mean and there are so many new voices it is difficult to recognize who is talking! It is one thing to have a new voice actor, but almost every main character has a totally new voice that isn't even close to their old voice and Sir Topham Hat even has a different accent! The problems with this movie do not end there. Minus the voices it was just a bad movie. The storyline is forced and choppy, the songs are weird, the message is unclear, the character motives are vastly different from past movies, the list goes on and on. It seems as if a new team has taken over Sodor and decided to start from scratch and gone in a terribly wrong direction with our good friends on Sodor. This might be our last Thomas movie. So sad.

7289397,2,B00ZR3W3WI,"(Cons)
  I have to say that Thomas has become almost as annoying as Anakin Skywalker (Episode 2 and 3).  Thomas is a lying little jerk that whines and blames others for his troubles.  He even goes so far as to place blame on others for the accidents he causes through his careless actions.
  Thomas used to own up to his mistakes, learn from them, and then move on.  He was remorseful if his actions caused confusion and delays.  He worked harder to better himself.
  I do not like this direction for Thomas and I do not like my three toddlers seeing this side of Thomas.  Please bring back the honest, loveable little tank engine we have come to love.
.
(Pros)
  Colors are beautiful and the textures are amazing.  Visually, this is a fantastic movie.
  The songs are very catchy and fun. (one of them is chorus line-esk in performance.)
  They re-introduce several characters that we have not seen in quite some time.  And a several new ones that could prove to be fun additions. (I won't spoil it for you.)
