8286400,5,B001CB96S8,I wanted these after seeing her on FIT TV and loved her. She has a great personality and love her workouts. I only workout 2 or 3 times a week but it definitely helps and has toned me up.,1431388800,,187,3.8205128205128207
8286401,5,B001CB96S8,"I was introduced to Sharon Mann on FitTV, she is very high energy and her workouts are always fantastic!  This disc set offers a little of everything so that you can switch it up.  The unique thing about this DVD set is you can customize your workout from over 1,000 different combinations!

From high-energy, cardio to flexibility and strength, this set can become a regular part of anyone's daily fitness routine.  First  choose a warm-up routine, then two workout routines and a cool-down  routine.  Have fun!",1391817600,,512,4.883720930232558
8286402,4,B001CB96S8,"Timely delivery, not as new as I thought the video to be but it works.  The title of this was The Gift Set but when I received it it was only one disc where the picture showed 4 disc but in the description it was ""1 of ""The Gift Set"", a little misleading.  When your eyes are drawn to the picture that is attached.",1371168000,,314,3.890625
8286403,5,B001CB96S8,"Sharon Mann used to be a regular on the Fitness Channel.  Now that this channel is more interested in off beat items instead of fitness (even though they call it ""Fitness and Health"")those who watched Sharon Mann regularly were very upset.  The channel receved numerous emails but to no avail.  Take heart fitness lovers!  She can still help you to stay in shape with these videos!  My wife loves them, and she watches them regularly.  I am glad she does because she looks really great!  Err, I mean my wife ... well, okay Sharon looks good too!",1364860800,,545,4.556701030927835
8286404,2,B001CB96S8,"Not my cup of tea - I am sure there are those that love it.  Not for me; and I am a yoga, exercise person.",1361836800,,106,3.24
8286405,5,B001CB96S8,"Some customers have had issues with the DVDs skipping or freezing, but I found them to be working just fine. I did give them away eventually because I was starting to tire of the same routines, and I thought someone else might enjoy them.",1358467200,,238,4.431818181818182
8286406,5,B001CB96S8,"The Works by Sharon Mann is an easy to use triple set of DVDs.  You can choose your own workout session or choose Sharon pre-set sessions.

The workout range from moderate to high stepping aerobics.  Sharon explains each pose and you will learn to follow easily.

I would recommend this set to anyone.

Amazon order and delivery is as smooth as can be and I enjoy shopping with them.",1312156800,,383,4.492753623188406
8286407,2,B001CB96S8,"I use exercise DVDs on a frequent basis.  When you workout at home, variety is the key to keeping the experience interesting so the formatting of this set interested me.  The first DVD is cardio and my first workout with that one was great.  The second time I used it, it started skipping and getting stuck.  I cleaned it and it got worse.  I then tried the others and at first they were fine so I thought the cardio one was just defective but the more I used the others, the more they also stalled.  I love the workouts but can not enjoy them.",1257897600,2,544,4.1826923076923075
8286408,5,B001CB96S8,"I really like Sharons The Works series. I have the cardio and the stregth dvd. There is also a pilates/ yoga one that I don't have. They are mix & match dvds that allow you to create your own workout. You choose 4 sections: warm up, workout 1, workout 2, and cooldown to create a 30 min w/o. You get to choose from 4 different w/u's, 8 section 1 w/os, 8 (different) section 2 w/os, and 4 cooldowns. Lots of variety and I always get a good w/o. The strength w/o actually has a lot of cardio options on it too. The segments are taken from her TV show and they are put together very nicely. Sharon has 4 background exercisers w/ her. She is always upbeat and I really enjoy her energy in this series.",1252627200,8,697,4.132352941176471
