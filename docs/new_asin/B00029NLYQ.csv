2070485,4,B00029NLYQ,"Yogilates is a blend of yoga and Pilates, and in Workout 2, instructor Jonathon Urla leads an intermediate-level class. The practice is broken into three sections, thus allowing you to customize your workout. The first 12-minute segment focuses mainly on stretches from a seated position to warm up the body. In the second segment, you'll start immediate with a shoulderstand/plow series and then move right into the Pilates rollover, which was a nice flow. You'll continue with additional Pilates-inspired abs work and then do some additional core work from an all-fours position; this entire segment lasted about 17 minutes. The third segment was the longest at 29 minutes. After some opening stretches, you'll move into a sun salutation series from yoga, gradually adding in additional poses such as lunges and the warrior series. The total time for the workout is 54 minutes.

Overall, I really enjoyed this hybrid practice, although I found it to be more yoga-focused than Pilates (I would have liked a bit more Pilates matwork). Jonathon Urla cues well and offers very good form pointers throughout the workout; he has a very encouraging, calming, and relaxing manner. This practice is probably most appropriate for those with some prior exposure to both yoga and Pilates who are interested in combining the two disciplines in an excellent, seamless flow.",1101600000,,1361,5.1863636363636365
2070486,4,B00029NLYQ,"As usual, I watched this all the way through before doing the video.  I thought it was a little funny, but here is my review.  I really think that if you do not know anything about pilates you should not pick this dvd because you might run through some of the poses without the proper positioning.  I was hurting a little the next day in the abs department.  Yoga doesn't work abs quite the same.",1095292800,9,396,4.24
2070527,5,B00029NLYQ,I really like this workout.  I love that it's broken into segments so you don't have to do it all at once.,1419465600,,106,3.8181818181818183
2070528,5,B00029NLYQ,Encourages discipline in your practice.  Great cuing.,1418342400,,53,6.571428571428571

2070533,5,B00029NLYQ,Johnathon Urla guides you though the 2nd edition of his workout program where it gets a lot more difficult than his beginners workout. I wish they had the advanced level 3 DVD on amazon,1404432000,,185,4.470588235294118
2070534,5,B00029NLYQ,"I got the beginners Yogilates and really liked it, so I thought I'd try this one, too. As with the first one, Urla calmly explains what to do, and stresses that it's OK to go at your own pace. I have done a lot of Pilates, but not so much yoga, so this is a really nice blend of both. Downward dog and some of the inverted postures are hard for me to do, but each section (there are 3 of them) gets you warmed up and ready to take them on. You will definitely feel stretched and worked out mentally and physically after doing Yogilates!",1401148800,,536,4.066037735849057
2070535,5,B00029NLYQ,I just got this dvd and know that I will be doing it quite a bit.  He is very pleasant without being too monotone and the corner picture showing the move from a different angle is very helpful.  It's challenging without being too hard and gives you something to work towards.  Looking forward to eventually moving onto his advanced dvd.,1397260800,,336,4.566666666666666
2070536,5,B00029NLYQ,My wife made this purchase for when she's not available to make a workout at the gym. She loves it.,1393891200,,99,4.0
2070557,5,B00029NLYQ,"I am quite the fan of Jonathan Urla. It is my belief (from my limited knowledge) that Mr. Urla was the first to combine Yoga and Pilates but whether he was the first to do it or not is irrelevant because he did it right. The moves from a yoga pose to a Pilates action are smooth and seamless and goes together with fluidity. And to be frank, it doesn't hurt that Mr. Urla is gorgeous too.",1386460800,,388,4.0519480519480515
2070558,4,B00029NLYQ,"I started Yogilates with the beginning workout by the same instructor that I'd checked out from the local library. I really liked it, so when it was time to return it I had to decide between buying that tape or moving up to this one. I was a little nervous about going with the Intermediate since I'd only done the beginning one for a month. Turns out this really isn't that much more difficult than the 1st one but it is longer, which I like. I feel like it is a good workout but I'm already feeling ready to move up to the Advanced DVD. The other downside of Jonathon's instruction is that he doesn't tend to give a lot of specifics about body positioning. When you are doing yoga, a small shift makes a big difference. So if you haven't done yoga at all, you might want to start with an intro to yoga tape so that you are doing the ypga moves correctly. Overall it is a good DVD & I'd buy it again.",1377561600,3,901,4.125
2070559,5,B00029NLYQ,I loved the first video in this series and had to buy the others. I love the fact that a few people lose balance or mess up - and as he said - just try again. I didn't feel intimidated -- but part of a real class. I would buy more of his videos.,1363651200,,245,3.5555555555555554
2070560,5,B00029NLYQ,"I love this video series.  They are split into 15 minute segments which is perfect for my busy life.  The greatest news is that since I started doing these videos or yoga in general my chronic unrelenting UTIs have gone away.  I have had chronic infections since my marriage 24 years ago.  I most recently, before the infections subsided, was taking a low dose of antibiotics on an as needed basis along with NOW Brand Cranberry capsuls.  I was having symptoms several times a week.  One day I noticed I was not having symptoms anymore.  I haven't changed anything in my life except doing these yoga tapes.  I was once told by a chiropractor that you can get rid of them through repositioning the organs inside your body through manipulation.  Maybe he was right.",1358035200,2,763,4.634328358208955
2070561,4,B00029NLYQ,"This is a good DVD and easy to use.  I am somewhat new to the yoga world, starting late at 53, but do enjoy this DVD as a change of pace from the fitness gym.  I do wish the music was a little more up beat but for the money, it is a good deal.",1357257600,,243,3.4
2070562,5,B00029NLYQ,"The instructor who hosts the video, Jonathon Urla, is by far one of the best instructors I've ever seen on a workout video. And, Yogilates is a phenomenal way to get your yoga, stretches, & Pilates done all at once. I always feel like I've done a serious workout after, while also feeling relaxed & renewed. I highly recommend it!",1354924800,,330,4.516666666666667
2070563,4,B00029NLYQ,"I have been doing this exercise dvd for about a month, several days a week, and while I would agree that it is not strenuous, it is an excellent workout for flexibility. I have done many workouts in my life, including P90X, Slim in Six and TaeBo and with this one I have increased my flexibility so much more in a shorter amount of time than with any other I've tried. I look forward to trying the advanced dvd.",1350432000,3,411,4.215189873417722
2070564,5,B00029NLYQ,"Definitely not for a beginner.  Challenging moves for people with some yoga experience.  Negative is that he doesn't know his right from left.  90% of the time, he would get it wrong.  Not confusing, but kind of comical.  Nice and long (1 hour) with 2 breaks so you don't have to do the whole video at once.  Seems a little more yoga oriented than pilates.  Doesn't have the super long holds which I find so boring.  More constant motion.",1314662400,,438,4.455696202531645
2070565,5,B00029NLYQ,I love this dvd.  I just started yoga and I have been doing pilates for a year or so.  I love the combination of yoga and pilates.  I have taken classes that combine yoga and pilates but this dvd is much better executed.  I wish he would make more in this series.,1305936000,,263,4.0
2070566,4,B00029NLYQ,I bought the DVD online for very cheap. It was precisly what I wanted for the price I was willing to pay and it was deleivered correctly.,1279238400,,137,4.111111111111111
2070592,5,B00029NLYQ,This is a fabulous workout. I have both the beginners and intermediate and Jonathon's gentle and detailed instructions for the poses are very kind and easy to follow. He is very likable and you do work up a sweat. I would probably recommend doing this DVD in a heated room so as to really get into the streches. Overall this was a great buy and I will be looking forward to getting the next DVD from Jonathon.,1277683200,2,409,4.324675324675325
2070593,3,B00029NLYQ,The level of instruction on this DVD is perfect for me - my only comment is the poses on this DVD are very rushed.  In my local yoga class there is smooth transition between the poses.  On this DVD you only hold a pose for a few moments before rushing to the next one - wish I could devise a smooth method to hit the pause button to really enjoy.  Good instruction - but only watched the DVD once because of this hurried approach.,1271721600,,430,4.095238095238095
2070594,2,B00029NLYQ,"This was dissapointing to me, i was looking for an nyc style yoga/pilates burn.
this dvd is instructional and very slow.
It would be good for someone older, and out of shape, or maybe for parents and children.
His voice is very soothing and pleasant which is nice, all and all its more of a relaxing gentle experience.  if thats what you're into... go for it.",1247875200,2,359,4.4393939393939394
2070595,3,B00029NLYQ,"Being an avid pilates and yoga indiviual I was very excited to try a fusion of them both.  The dvd is well done, and the excersises are very clear. My only complaint is that the workout was not very challenging for me, I was hoping it would be a little more vigorous.  It was suuficiant to warm me up and stretch me out, but not at the level I usually work at.  I will definately try the advanced version, and hope for more.",1238457600,3,424,4.0843373493975905
2070596,3,B00029NLYQ,I have never done any type of pilates or yoga exercises. I bought the DVD to help me get in a routine of stretching and other activities. I instantly realized that this was one cheesy DVD but I was pleasantly surprised that the exercises were very effective. I have been enjoying my purchase.,1232064000,,292,4.528301886792453
2070597,5,B00029NLYQ,"Johnathan Urla makes THE BEST workout DVDs out there.  I have 4 of his different pilates and yogilates series.  I would buy anything that he put out on the market, and wish that he had his own show.  A great buy for someone who wants to condense both workouts into one!",1224806400,,269,4.235294117647059
2070598,2,B00029NLYQ,Video was really cheesy and only had one sequence that was mildly challenging for someone of intermediate skill.,1215216000,,112,5.277777777777778
2070599,4,B00029NLYQ,"Ok, I can add it's set in a studio with 3 women & 2 men all in great shape. Great lighting, good sound, good music, not too fast, not too boring. Jonathan leads speaking/teaching in real time. He will perform all the exercises himself & then help others as they stay in it. He cues YOUR left & right, not his/students. He gives great instruction, has a soothing voice, but not to soothing. This almost felt to me like a rigorous stretching workout rather then anything else. The warm up was the entire first section & at first I thought it would be too easy. After the warm up & stretching, there is modified & full pilates, stretching of the legs, butterfly stretch, torso stretching, bridge bridge w/1 leg up,  etc. Last he gets more advanced with modified & full side plank, standing  He saves the sun salutations, warrior poses, triangle, side angle, chair, camel, standing wide legged fwd bends, for almost last. Though many of the postures were modified, some were not. With all the stretching, time went quickly & I didn't realize I was sweating, heart racing & out of breath until it was almost over.

There's a video preview if you search google's videos on a Japanese site with Japanese voice over.",1208822400,5,1208,4.609302325581395
2070600,5,B00029NLYQ,"After 3 months of practice Yogilates level 1 I moved to level 2, you can't start level 2 if you didn't practice before Yoga. I start losing pounds, my body is shaping and the best thing take back the control of myself",1208736000,2,217,4.190476190476191
2070601,4,B00029NLYQ,"I found the intermediate workout for yogilates to be a really good follow up to the beginner routine.  I thoroughly enjoyed the beginner routine, so I was quite satisfied with the intermediate workout.  The intermediate routine had the same set up and flow as the beginner workout, but was significantly more difficult, which was what I was looking for.  The only reason I cannot give this product 5 stars is because the disk itself is a bit flawed and has a skip in it.  All in all, I would recommend this workout to anyone who has mastered the beginner's routine and found it enjoyable.",1206835200,,588,4.625
2070622,3,B00029NLYQ,Overall it was a great workout. I'm used to a lot of yoga and pilates in my workouts and I think this was a great fit. My only concern is that you are moving fast! There is little time to actually focus on a lot of the warrior poses and relax with it. Pretty good buy if you are on vacation and want a quick workout but nothing too strenuous.,1200614400,,342,3.9
2070623,4,B00029NLYQ,"This is a great video, but it IS advanced.  I used to use the beginner level  video and that one is awesome too.  Something about Jonathan Urla, he is so motivating, he just makes you want to keep going!  Good workout, reasonable price.",1195689600,,236,4.4186046511627906
2070624,4,B00029NLYQ,"This DVD provides an excellent workout, just a little more difficult than Yogilates 1 - Beginners.  (Again, my only gripe would be that there is no indication of which moves are Pilates moves, Yoga moves or a combination of both.  So, as far as breathing goes, it is always inhale or exhale ONLY.  I have been taking Yogilates from an instructor who teaches the difference between Pilates and Yoga breathing techniques and when to use them.)",1190246400,,441,4.776315789473684
2070625,5,B00029NLYQ,"I have always had an interest in but found exercise hard to stick with due to time constraints, etc. so I would go from running everyday to not running for months, etc. After the birth of my first child, I was looking for a convenient form of exercise that I could do at home and that would help me to tone my stomach muscles. I practiced with Louise Solomon's Yogalates for awhile; she does a great job of introducing proper form for yoga positions, but after a year or so of continuous practice, I was very bored with her tapes....then I found this one. At first, I found it a little confusing, but within a couple tries, I was able to do the whole tape, and it was fun, relaxing, and just challenging enough. I loved this DVD. I CERTAINLY got my money's worth, since I probably used it close to 200 times.....and I was very sad when I felt like I was no longer getting enough exercise from this tape, since it is a smooth and relaxing workout. I agree with a previous reviewer who said that if you stick with this DVD, you will probably find it motivating enough to continue to Level 3.....And though the 3rd one is significantly more challenging but also a great buy, it is exciting to be able to think of yourself as an ""advanced practitioner."" If you have some familiarity with yoga and are looking for something a little more ""workout-like"" I don't think you'll regret purchasing this. I still plan to use this one if I am unable to do the 3rd one due to an injury, etc. It really is a fun DVD!!!!",1184112000,11,1504,4.318021201413427
2070626,4,B00029NLYQ,"I like this workout very much, very relaxing.  It tends to lean on the yoga side with a sprinkling of Pilates.  I do enjoy doing this workout between ""Reach"" workouts which is more intense.",1182470400,2,189,4.529411764705882
2070627,3,B00029NLYQ,This is a great DVD if you want more yoga exercises than Pilates.  It was relaxing and flowed very well from one exercise to the next.,1168473600,,134,4.153846153846154
2070628,1,B00029NLYQ,"I ordered this DVD direct from Jonathan Urla's website in December 2005 as part of a 3 DVD box set which covers levels 1, 2 and 3.

My level 2 DVD did not work properly - voice and picture didn't match and I began to hear a doubling on the sound track as if the player were reading from two different voice recordings at the same time. Then the picture started jumping and skipping until I found myself at the end of the program in no time at all. Needless to say the DVD was useless to me.

I contacted the company and was told there was a problem with the master copy and that I would be sent a new copy when they were remastered.

I waited and waited for that new copy and finally contacted the company again after about 3 months had passed. It seems they had the remastered copies but forgot about their promise to send me a clean copy.

Well, the 'clean copy' finally arrived in March but it too had problems with the sound track and I found it impossible to follow the program due to the sound issues. So I contacted the company again.

I was asked to send back the bad copies they had sent me (they didn't offer to pay for postage) and told that they would try again. But once again the same problem.

I was told this time that they would view the copy they sent me before sending it out and they asked again that I return the bad copy. I returned the bad copy several weeks ago and still haven't received a replacement.

Now I've tried to contact the company by email and phone and suddenly nobody returns my calls or emails.

I don't know what is going on but I feel abandoned. I've not been offered any money for the postage on returning the bad copy, no refund has been issued and I still don't have a working copy of the level 2 DVD.

The program may be a good one but the DVD has a big flaw and the company just doesn't care enough to take care of their customers once they got the money.

I feel mistreated and I will not be doing business with them again.

*****UPDATE*****

Exactly one day after I posted my first review I heard back from Jonathan Urla about my DVD problems.

He offered to refund my money for the DVD I returned. I was disappointed that we couldn't work out a way for me to get a DVD that worked properly in my player but since I had originally received the DVD on December 6th and had been trying for over 4 months to get a working copy I was ready to get my money back.

I received a reply email dated April 27th saying, ""Your refund is forthcoming.""

It is now July 18th and I'm still awaiting my refund. I sent an inquiry by email about a month ago to ask how my refund was to come to me and when I should expect it but I never heard back.

This may be a wonderful program if you can get it to play properly on your DVD player but I have to say I'm very disappointed in the customer service that I've received from Mr. Urla's company.

***UPDATE***
October 2007 and I never received a working copy or the refund I was promised.  I wonder if my bad review was the reason for promising but never sending my refund?",1145923200,10,3050,4.1233108108108105
2070629,5,B00029NLYQ,"I was both a little skeptical and intrigued about yogilates when I first heard about it.  I'm advanced in pilates and intermediate in yoga so I thought a combined workout might be interesting.  I did the whole workout (54 min, 3 separate sections) and time just flew.  It was both challenging and easy to follow.  I agree with one of the reviews that this DVD is more focused on yoga than pilates, but I still enjoyed it. Jonathan Urla carefully explains all the poses and reminds you about the correct alignment.  I really liked the small screen that showed the pose from the side as well.  I'm going to try level 3 next. The instructor is excellent and I'm thinking about attending his class in NY.",1140480000,24,700,4.515873015873016
2070630,5,B00029NLYQ,"I've done Jonathan Urla's Beginner (or Level One) Yogilates workout (see my review of it for more detail).  Here he takes it up a notch, again seamlessly merging yoga and Pilates exercises into a graceful, flowing, and challenging workout.  The calm voice and excellent instruction are back, as is the trippy and mystical music.

This workout does move a bit faster and is a bit more challenging than the beginner workout, though, so please try that one first if you have no experience with yoga or Pilates.  Nonetheless, most of the exercises were pretty accessible to me, someone with some experience in yoga and minimal in Pilates.  I'll need a few more times through to really start to feel comfortable with the workout, though, and some of the poses were a little beyond me.

But that is what practice is all about, is it not?

If you want a workout to challenge your core muscles as well as your mind and soul -- if you want a workout that leaves you feeling energized and centered and bendy and strong -- check out this DVD!  (But check out the beginners' DVD first if you are one...)
