8304204,5,B001G6SOPA,"I waited several months to order this video, and I should have bought it right away. A very heartwarming story about the famous Peasall Sisters act, and their parents. The video describes their short career, which they ended for now so they could get married and focus on raising  their children, the way parents should. Hopefully they will start up after the children are raised!

Although the video is somewhat an amateur effort, the story is worth it. To see parents who know how to handle raising kids who have a career is just inspiring. Maybe I should send my copy to Billy Ray Cyrus and order another!

There are a number of songs on here, but to get the best quality, buy a CD.",1382745600,2,685,4.464
8304205,5,B001G6SOPA,"This DVD was really great as it's a ""live"" performance of the Peasall sisters (plus commentary).  After watching the movie, I looked up the voices behind the singing family of girls in the movie and WOW, I really enjoy their music!  What a blessing - and they seem to be a wonderful family ""salt of the earth"" in this America of ours.",1361577600,2,334,4.370967741935484
8304206,5,B001G6SOPA,Thanks for the great service.  I loved the DVD of the Peasall Sisters.  I loved hearing their history and family.  Thanks for such a great opportunity to buy from you!  If you have children or young people would be a great gift for them.,1356048000,,237,4.318181818181818
8304207,5,B001G6SOPA,"This video is excellent!  Not only do you get to hear these ladies' lovely voices and musical abilities, but you hear a lot about who they are and how they got there.  Definitely worth the money!",1312761600,,195,4.388888888888889
8304208,5,B001G6SOPA,"This DVD is mostly built around an intimate concert in a restaurant/country store. Interwoven with segments of the performance (plus footage from various other performances) is a documentary about their music, their family, home schooling, and their unabashed Christian testimony. Don't worry; the documentary aspect is not overloaded. There is plenty of great music! A very enjoyable DVD! I'm trying to figure out why they have not done a CD since 2005. If anyone knows any information about future recording plans, please post here.",1244764800,3,534,5.369047619047619
8304209,5,B001G6SOPA,"What's wrong with this DVD?  ITS TOO SHORT!  If you are a fan, you will love this DVD.  The content is excellent.  The editing is crisp as the DVD moves from Performances to family life.  I especially enjoyed the concert sequences where you can appreciate the excellent musicianship of the Peasall Sisters.  Dad's not bad either.  The production quality was very good as well as the sound and lighting.  A very enjoyable, albeit, short, DVD.  Worth every penny.",1231113600,6,461,4.8076923076923075
