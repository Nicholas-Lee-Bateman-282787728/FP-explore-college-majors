1675484,5,B00005Y6XP,"Charlotte's newest DVD features songs from her new CD ""Enchantment"". This is an older angel than then one we saw in ""Voice of an Angel"" but what we see is someone who is branching out from the arias of the past. While at times, the songs seem to be out of place and forced...I didn't really care because Charlotte can sing ... If you have all of Charlotte's over DVD's than you should complete your collection...and then await the next one...which is what I'll ne doing.",1012694400,7,470,4.476744186046512
1675518,5,B00005Y6XP,"I bought this cd when I was living in Atlanta, Georgia. I was 12 and I bought Charlotte Church cd because I love the music and her voice is like an Angel singing... Is one of the best. She's pretty too. ^__^",1344470400,,207,3.9523809523809526
1675519,5,B00005Y6XP,"Actually, my son requested this.  Charlotte Church is one of his favorites.  He listens to her cd's over and over and loves the DVD.  Her voice is angelic, the songs are beautiful.  Both of us enjoy listening to her.",1241395200,,216,4.461538461538462
1675520,5,B00005Y6XP,This is one of the best concert video's I have seen and will continue to watch it again.,1208649600,,88,3.9444444444444446
1675521,1,B00005Y6XP,She has said that she wants to be another Madonna but with the musical selections that she always ends up with it would seem that she is more likely aiming for sainthood! Great voice but lighten up for such a young singer. Does she always think that she is singing for a church audience?,1190073600,,287,4.333333333333333
1675522,5,B00005Y6XP,"One of the most gifted singers alive.. At this stage in her development, 15 I think, the performance alternates between that of a phenomenal singer bellowing out her tunes with amazing strength and beauty, and then when the song is over, she's a  teenage girl again, acting as if she's putting on a show for a few dozen classmates at a school dance. It's a charming performance to watch, and the sheer beauty of some of the songs melts the heart. The production quality lacks just a bit, but for its quality of enjoyment, I give it the highest marks.

Thanks to God for such a gift!",1145664000,2,582,4.429906542056075
1675523,5,B00005Y6XP,"Her best effort to date since her 1st ""Voice of an Angel"" debut.

Enjoyed her doing Broadway tunes and a good mix for those who have not been introduced to this poised and mature for her age super talented singer.  1st class production values on this DVD.

Thank you Charlotte for sharing your gift to us all.",1125532800,5,309,4.385964912280702
1675524,5,B00005Y6XP,"Available in VHS or DVD this live concert is absolutely terrific. You can save some money with the VHS version if you wish as it is produced full quality in hi-fi stereo. It is almost 2 hours in length - a real treat. Charlotte and her beautiful voice are stunning. Apparently most Americans are not aware of this terrific video since it has not been reviewed in about 2 years. Rest assured, I think it would be almost impossible for you to be disappointed with this live concert. Please, please enjoy this terrific performance by Charlotte, guests and the orchestra.",1119571200,8,567,4.68
1675525,4,B00005Y6XP,"This was an enjoyable dvd to watch if you happen to like
classical music and you have followed Charlotte Church
for the past couple years now.  You could probably buy the
best of and be just as happy.",1055289600,,200,4.2631578947368425
1675526,5,B00005Y6XP,I just recieved this dvd and it wasn't what the description said it was. It's supposed to be 116 mintues long and on the back of the dvd it says 101 mintues and it's not full screen version. I just wanted to know if anyone else who has this was it full screen?,1051660800,,260,3.9245283018867925
1675527,5,B00005Y6XP,"Maybe playing on her home turf got rid of the stage fright and nervousness that plagued her in her Jerusalem concert video.  It could also be that she's gotten more confidence with age.  Anyway, this is a marked improvement over her previous concert.  She's at her most beautiful so far, has more confidence and poise, flashes that winning smile of hers, and singing in top form.  She still has some of that nervousness, only this time, she isn't speaking to the audience at Warp 8000 like she did before.  She's slowed down considerably--to Warp 1000.  Just kidding--she speaks okay here.  And she still says ""Thank you"" with the second word at a higher register, like ""Thankyip!""
A brief orchestral medley comprising of ""Tonight"" and ""Somewhere"" from West Side Story is played by the National Orchestra of Wales under the guidance of Arnie Roth.  Charlotte sweeps on stage in a white gown, singing ""Tonight"", the first song from her third album Enchantment.  In fact she sings all songs from Enchantment except for ""The Flower Duet"" and ""The Laughing Song"".
""If I Loved You"", from Carousel, turns out to be her grandmother's favourite song, so she does that, followed by ""The Water Is Wide"", and do we get a real sample of her vocal talents here!
Then there's ""Bali Ha'i"" from South Pacific.  During this song, the lights go magenta and there are specks of light, such as would come from a mirror ball.
Before going into the Celtic-sounding ""Carrickfergus"" with those exotic Uilleann pipes, the best song from Enchantment, she says that she's really nervous.  The orchestral backing really helps here and from her emotive high notes, it's clear she loves this song with a capital L.  So do I!
Costume change, with black trousers, blouse, and a beaded lace wrap, with which she sings ""Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man"" from Porgie And Bess, and ""A Bit Of Earth"".
With her second guest, a Welsh harpist, she performs two Welsh songs from Voice Of An Angel:  ""Suo Gan"" and that mystical magical song ""My Lagan Love"".
Josh Groban pops up for two duets.  First is ""Somewhere"", from West Side Story, the second is ""The Prayer"", their rendition of the Celine Dion/Andrea Bocelli duet.
Break time, and Roth and his orchestra do a quick burst of Carmen while the stage is lit red.  before Charlotte comes back on stage dressed in a red dress, with her hair in a bun.
Then comes Jesse Cook and Kevin, two musicians on guitar, who take Charlotte from ""The Little Horses"", ""From My First Moment"", and ""Habanera.""  This latter song features some bongo players as rhythm.
Another costume change, this time a black dress with straps.  Before singing ""Papa Can You Hear Me"" she remarks that Streisand sang this before her and that she would never top that.  Wrong, Charlotte--you do it better than Streisand.  Her voice is at her best when singing the next song, ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" and boy does she hit that high note without flubbing it.  She's got range!  She does justice to a cover of John Lennon's ""Imagine"", dedicating it to the people who died in the 11 September attacks, and to follow up, she does ""Amazing Grace"", which she also did on Voice Of An Angel.  The show ends with her guest stars bringing her bouquets.
Well done, sweet Charlotte!  At 82 minutes, quite a good show, with lots of songs.  Now if she would maintain the same poise that she did in her next concert, she'll be well on her way to the top.",1042243200,34,3409,4.681208053691275
1675545,5,B00005Y6XP,"This collection presented by Miss Church is her best to date. Her voice has grown and she is not afraid to be herself on stage. She looks stunning in every scene and the orchestra is breathtaking. The concert is varied, covering Broadway musicals, updated arias, pop ballads and Gaelic airs.  Her duets with Josh Groban are amazing and, along with the haunting ""Carrickfergus"" and the tango inspired ""Habanera,"" are the highlights of the program.
The special features also deserve mention. Miss Church's video tour of Cardiff with ""Carrickfergus"" playing in the background is fun. The interviews also show how mature she is. A definite must for all Miss Church's fans.",1035590400,6,668,5.072727272727272
1675546,5,B00005Y6XP,"Hello. First I would like to say this is by far the best dvd yet!
Charlotte has come along way sense voice of and angel. Her range of music and ever changing voice is wonderful!!I recommend this dvd to all music lovers.",1018915200,8,219,4.238095238095238
1675547,5,B00005Y6XP,"This DVD is awesome. Charlotte is at her very best in the concert. The orchestra played phonomanally, and Charlotte sung georgously!! The music flowed together flawlessly and beautifully. This should definately be in the video collection of any Charlotte Church fan!",1018656000,8,266,5.512195121951219
1675548,5,B00005Y6XP,"I decided to purchase this DVD as I turned out to really like her Enchantment CD. It's one of those I usually put on to relax and unwind. All I have to say is that I enjoyed this DVD... and her music... whatever form it is. There's already a lot of controversies and debates about this young Miss and her music, and I don't want to get involved with any of it. I guess it all boils down to on how she broke the classical and opera barriers and departed from their existing norms, blending some pop elements into her music.
As for me, I'm evaluating it's musicality objectively. How it works for me... And I have to say that listening to her does some wonders to me other than just filling my music room with her enchanting voice. Now, watching her perform live on stage is even better. I was awe-struck! Great duet with Josh Groban, too!
And somehow, whether it be after listening to her CD or watching her concert, it made me feel like a better person. And what a great feeling it was! Ahhh... it must've been music for the soul. And that's what music is all about to me. Charlotte has successfully imparted that magical feeling. This I believe, is essential in whatever musical genre a person is listening to -- whether it be rock, or prog rock, or jazz, classical, opera, bossa, rap, pop, heavy metal...
And that, to me is worthy enough of 5 bright, shining stars!",1018137600,7,1367,4.3858267716535435
1675549,5,B00005Y6XP,"The beauty of Charlotte coupled with the scenery of Wales makes this a must. In person one can get an idea of her charismatic personality and the love of her ""hometown crowd"".",1016928000,2,175,4.5
1675550,5,B00005Y6XP,"This is probably the best DVD concert I've seen in a while...
This is art...art, beauty, and pure loveliness...all in one easy top buy DVD. :)
It features many songs from her latest CD, Enchantment, along with some old favorites.
What really makes it worth the money though, are the two new songs, track 19 and 20. One of these, Bridge Over Troubled Water is only available here and on the 35 dollar, Japanese version of Enchantment. It is truly the most beautiful version I've ever heard of that song...
I couldn't stop watching when I bought this...and now that I have the Japanese album, I also can't stop listening...
It's just so beautiful.
The other gem is ""Imagine"", ONLY available here. ... ...[it was] truly beautiful.
Other songs that stand out are ""Habaera"" with her lovely Spanish dancing, ""The Prayer"" and ""Somewhere"" with the vocals of the wonderful and equally talented Josh Groban and ""Amazing Grace"" sung with such passion and giving of such comfort...
Just hearing her is enough to make you believe that it'll be ok, it really will...",1015027200,6,1052,4.785714285714286
1675551,5,B00005Y6XP,"The best production of Charlotte in Video.
Extraordinary perfomance of Charlotte singing live!
Great duets with Josh Groban!
Magnificent execution of the Orchestra!
Wonderful tour and images of Cardiff!
Excellent bonus tracks including ""Imagine""!
And Charlotte extremely beautiful...
In my scale from 1 to 10 This DVD has 11.",1014076800,8,325,5.653061224489796
1675552,4,B00005Y6XP,"To see a girl of 15, with voice so pure and clear as a bell, sing Habanera, one the classic mature songs of all times is pure entertainment. Except for Art Garfunkel himself, I haven't heard anybody sing the high notes of Bridge over Troubled Waters with such freshness, effortlessness and intensity. Charlotte,no doubt, will continue to enchant us for a very long time.",1013904000,6,370,4.796875
1675553,5,B00005Y6XP,"WOW I just finished watching Charl's new DVD what an improvement.
The video quality was much better than any that came before. And the sound for a live concert is excelent. Then there's Charlotte she was as always Charlotte. No one will ever convince me that she isn't at least part Angel. ...
Not only does she mesmerize us with her beautiful voice through 19 songs but she also gives us a tour of her home town Cardiff Wales.
I would encourage everyone to get a copy ""Enchantment From Cardiff Wales"" You won't regret it believe me.",1012867200,12,533,4.505154639175258
1675554,5,B00005Y6XP,"After four albums and three DVDs, this being her fourth, Charlotte has really matured in her style and resonance of her voice. The music for the album of the same name had two new producers working with her, this allowed her to broaden her musical choices. Everything from a Spanish guitar on ""Habenera"" to the energetic beat of ""All the Pretty Horses"" (which ""was"" a lullaby).
Her other albums and concerts are more classical and operatic. This DVD has more ""experimental"" music as Charlotte puts it. This is not to say there aren't songs from her usual classical repertoir. The concert has a lot of great flavor and zest to its pieces, the sound quality is excellent.
Charlotte plays a few songs from earlier albums, the best being her reinvention from her original album's (Voice of an Angel) version of ""Amazing Grace"" to a more traditional classical tone.
If you love a beautiful female voice this is a great concert DVD. I highly recommend it.",1012867200,8,949,4.757575757575758

7956788,3,B00005Y6XP,"I have the CD, thought the DVD of the concert would enhance the music, but the recording isn't the greatest.  The orchestra overwhelms her voice most of the time.  And she has a powerful voice, so it must be a problem with the way it was recorded.
Her personality, and sometimes her voice, come through clearly.",1383868800,,311,4.535714285714286
