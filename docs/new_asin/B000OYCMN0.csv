2804216,5,B000OYCMN0,This is an excellent 30 minutes tape.  I can already see the results after only 1 week.,1191110400,5,87,4.117647058823529
2804217,5,B000OYCMN0,It's Leslie at her best. I workout to many of her tapes and love them all.,1190851200,8,74,3.6875
2804218,4,B000OYCMN0,This is a really good 27 minute workout and if you feel up to it and have the time you can do it all again.  Every other day should be a cardio-workout.  It all gets you in shape fast.,1188950400,11,184,3.6923076923076925
2804219,3,B000OYCMN0,"This is definitely a beginner's guide to toning with a ""stretchie band.""  Leslie spends a l-o-t of time explaining each move and talks a l-o-t between each set, which is probably helpful to someone who has no experience using either the band or handweights, but is downright boring to someone who has.  Leslie is alone in this workout, so she's mainly just talking to the camera (aka, you) and not interacting with her class -- this workout is a prime example of how difficult it can be for video instructors to keep their enthusiasm stoked when there are no other players to play with!",1181174400,33,586,4.625
2804220,5,B000OYCMN0,"WalkSlim Fast Firming is the PERFECT complement to Leslie's brand new walks, FastStart,3 Fast miles and 4 Fast miles!! Designed to be used as a system,Fast Firming uses a super high quality resistance band(included inside the DVD case). The workout is about 35 minutes and Leslie works every muscle in your body in innovative ways,all exercises use the band. You control the resistance of the band so you are able to make this workout as easy or as difficult as YOU want it to be.

  Leslie's instruction and cuing are,as always,flawless and she is so incredibly motivating. This is an excellent firming workout!!",1180224000,48,613,4.932038834951456
2804283,5,B000OYCMN0,"This is a great add on to other Leslie's DVD's.  It comes with a stretchie band - medium resistance and the workout is good for sculpting and toning.  One thing to know is that you will need a chair and a mat when you do this workout as I was caught off guard, but was lucky I had them at hand.",1329177600,,294,3.80327868852459
2804284,5,B000OYCMN0,"I had ordered this product thinking that it was a walking DVD, and when I received it, found that there was only a 3 minute walking warm up, and then a bunch of stretching exercises, etc. I reviewed the product after that, and gave the seller high marks still, because of the fast shipping, etc. I was only a little confused on the write up, since it didn't state that it wasn't a walking DVD. However, about a week or so after that, I received ANOTHER DVD in the mail from the seller, which was, in fact, a walking DVD. The seller had sent AND shipped it to me for no charge, since she wanted me to get what I had thought I was paying for. I was very surprised, and very thankful! You don't find many people like that these days selling on sites such as this, or auction sites! I was very impressed! So this seller is wonderful, in my experience! Very highly recommended! This DVD is good for after you use the walking dvd's and take some weight off... this will help tone you up. In combination, it's great. Alone, just make sure that you are only wanting to tone up.",1328832000,2,1069,4.245098039215686
2804285,4,B000OYCMN0,"I really enjoy Leslie Sansone workouts.  They really encourage you and I can feel that she has a good spirit.  I know that a lot of people says that her constant talking is a little annoying; on those days, I just turn down the volume.  When I feel like I need encouragement when I don't feel like walking, I just turn the volume up. I strongly recommend her workouts.",1319068800,,368,4.304347826086956
2804286,5,B000OYCMN0,"I love it but then I love just about all of her workouts! They don't put stress on my body but still burn calories and fat and tone your body. I have Lupus and it's difficult to workout at times. Even on some of my bad days I can still do at least one of Leslie's dvds. They are incouraging, uplifting and easy to do!",1305849600,7,317,3.8923076923076922
2804287,4,B000OYCMN0,"I was used to doing the 3 mile walk so this was easy and short, but powerful.  It's good for the days you want to strength and a bit of walking.  I love Leslie!",1297123200,2,160,3.676470588235294
2804288,5,B000OYCMN0,"I like this one...it is a beginner level; if you want a more strenuous workout, look elsewhere. In the DVD, Leslie says you will want to work up to 2 sets when you're more advanced...so do the DVD twice to get the 2 sets.. I especially like the floor exercises... It is a nice compliment to the Walk Slim DVD's. I usually do this one after I have done 3 fast miles or 4 fast miles. It's a keeper.",1290470400,,396,4.025316455696203
2804289,5,B000OYCMN0,"Leslie Sansone makes it easy and comfortable for the average middle aged adult to exercise in the home, to get a good workout without dislocating a joint or throwing our backs out with all the newest exercise DVD's out showing people jumping around, twisting and boxing at the air.",1285200000,,281,4.755102040816326
2804290,3,B000OYCMN0,"I own many, many Leslie DVD's and would not be surprised to discover that she walks on water (just kidding).  This DVD is good to get you started with a band, but after a time or two, it gets very boring.  BUT I love the band and use it every day.  I just don't use the DVD anymore.  Once you learn the exercises, it is much easier to simply work at your own pace and concentrate on the areas you are most interest in.  For example, I spend about five full minutes on the leg scissor exercises for inner thighs - I do smaller one and larger ones for a different burn.  This DVD will get you started but you probably won't use it for long.  But you'll love the band that comes with the DVD.",1239580800,2,689,4.022058823529412
2804291,3,B000OYCMN0,I like others that she's done but I did not realize this involved a band which is not my thing.,1238889600,,95,3.8
2804292,4,B000OYCMN0,"I have most of Leslie's walk tapes and really enjoy using them.  This one with the firm band is OK, but she could have given it more time; making the workout a little more intense with more repetition of the various exercises - overall an OK work out !",1219017600,,252,4.142857142857143
2804327,1,B000OYCMN0,"I thought I would get a more intense workout for strength training.  I like to follow someone and got in a quick motion.  This is very basic with a lot of down time.  The box states the video is 40 minutes, so I expected a full 30 minutes of workout with good warm up and cool down.  Total, it is less than 30 minutes.  This is great to learn moves, but that is all!",1213660800,,366,3.891891891891892
2804328,2,B000OYCMN0,"I am a huge fan of Leslie and her walking I have pretty much all of her workouts. This firming is my least favorite. She lacks a lot in this workout. I wanted more firming moves this is VERY BASIC. This came with 2,3 and 4 fast miles I just expected it to be for advanced walkers.",1204502400,2,280,3.9298245614035086
2804329,5,B000OYCMN0,"I used this dvd after doing another of Leslie's Walking videos and the 2 combined are an excellent workout for beginner to moderate level.  I have lost 11 pounds in 3 weeks so far. It's just a start, but it's working!  Leslie's videos are an awesome way to get some exercise in and to boost your energy level.",1204070400,4,309,4.310344827586207
2804330,3,B000OYCMN0,"This video is listed as 40 minutes, but it is 27 minutes long, including warm up and stretch.  It is probably the least favorite one I've done of hers, because it feels very rushed out and the camera operation is not that great...you see the cue cards during it several times and she spends a lot of time explaining between moves what you are going to do. She was solo too, so you didn't get the playfulness of the group atmosphere.
I'm a huge fan of hers, just not so much of this specific video.  But I did like the moves she did with the stretchie.",1203984000,,551,4.188679245283019
2804331,2,B000OYCMN0,This DVD would not play in one of my DVD players.  It does work in another DVD player I have.  It is almost all stretching.  I prefer walking.,1203897600,,142,4.0
2804332,2,B000OYCMN0,I reactivated an old injury with this tape because the warm up is not long enough.,1203120000,,82,4.1875
2804333,5,B000OYCMN0,"I have lost a lot of weight in the past 16 months.  Thank you Leslie!  I have also worked out in the Gym with personal trainers.  Anyway, I am in pretty great shape.  Just received the DVD and did the workout 2 days ago.  I am still feeling the burn.  Granted I made the strechie as tight as possible.  I feel like I got a better ""quick"" workout then I have ever using weights at the gym.  Great Job!  Don't let bad reviews deter you from this video.  Try for yourself, I bet you won't regret it!",1202256000,8,496,4.020618556701031
2804334,5,B000OYCMN0,"At first, I did not think I could get much of a workout with the band, but boy was I suprised! It really works and strengthens you. Its short, only about 30 minutes. Through combining Leslie's other DVDs with this one, I have lost 18 pounds!",1198454400,4,241,4.260869565217392
2804335,1,B000OYCMN0,"I was disappointed in the Fast Firming DVD. The strength training wasn't all that great and the running time states 40 minutes but in fact it's half of that, though I don't personally want or need 40 minutes of strength training at a time, but those who are looking for that will be disappointed. I also don't find working out with a stretchie all that easy to do, it hurts my wrist and/or my hands when holding it. A resistance band (you know with handles) or dumbells would have probably made it a little more effective. Leslie's short cut series is a much better investment than this in my opinion.",1198195200,5,601,4.472727272727273
2804336,5,B000OYCMN0,This is a good DVD to use in addition to the walking at home DVD's.  Firming the entire body with the stretchie - didn't feel it so much until the next morning - wow every muscle definitely had a workout.  Great!!,1193270400,7,213,4.170731707317073
8187472,5,B000OYCMN0,Love it!!!!!,1483920000,,12,5.5
8187473,5,B000OYCMN0,I love this workout. I had one but it was defective.  I sent it back to Leslie to exchange it but the one I received was also defective.  Needless to say I was somewhat upset and threw it in the trash.  When I had an opportunity to buy another one I did not hesitate,1470268800,,266,3.888888888888889
8187474,5,B000OYCMN0,This is a great total body band workout. A great addition to your Leslie collection and a great toning workout for days between weight training or for those who prefer resistance bands to weights. Leslie hits every body part and ends with a floor stretch.,1444176000,,255,4.688888888888889
8187475,5,B000OYCMN0,It is easy and gives good results,1441324800,,33,3.857142857142857

8187479,5,B000OYCMN0,Leslie never disappoints! Good cardio and strength training workout! Love mixing the strength work with the cardio. I have about 10-15 of her workout dvd's...I mix them around and love them all!,1368057600,,194,5.09375
8187480,5,B000OYCMN0,This is a great 30 minute workout.  I turn down the sound and use my own music CDs.  I alternate this one with her 4 mile walking CD for cardio.,1355011200,,144,3.7666666666666666
8187481,5,B000OYCMN0,Wow! I felt my muscles that were being worked out loved that feeling. Cant wait to see results in three months.,1353369600,2,111,4.333333333333333
