6396399,5,B00JXBLM72,"Great show and I love it, the only problem is that the English dub isn't nearly as good as the sub (and normally I don't care) but the voice for Tomoko isn't what I imagined it would be, that being said the box is a standard type box with no extras inside.",1418601600,,256,3.9423076923076925
6396400,5,B00JXBLM72,"Although it may seem mean-spirited toward the Protagonist, the series is comedic has Tomoko struggles between her complacency and very anti-social attitude as a NEET and her desire to become more popular in her High School years.

Voice acting in on Par with the Japanese audio, and the series is far more active than it looks, given it's a slice of life of a very non-active Teenager.

Highly Recommended, This is one of the most well-known and popular animes to come out in recent years, and it garnered it's popularity thanks to American and other Western countries interested in the story of a young, unpopular Japanese Teenage Woman.

Definitely purchase the Manga (Currently Vol 1-5 Available) published by Yen Press to get more out of it, and look forward to upcoming OVA in a few months!",1417737600,3,795,4.830882352941177
6396401,3,B00JXBLM72,"If there is one major difference that you will notice from here and the manga it's pacing. This is a fun show, but some episodes feel really drawn out to fit a time frame where the manga didn't have that problem. You'll get many of the same jokes from the manga, but expect to sit a while to get to the punchline. The english voice cast doesn't sound their best, but the characters in this are a bit different  so I wasn't expecting gold. Also a lot of western slang is thrown in which is also in the subs, so if you wanted to escape the dub by just watching the sub you will have to deal with that. Still it's a fun watch for anyone who is into the otaku world of anime.

The major downside over anything else I would say is the price. I got it on sale, but the original almost $70 price tag is insane for a 12 episode comedy slice of life series. If the series feels too drawn out for your tastes I would suggest just reading the manga.",1417392000,,938,4.037634408602151
6396402,5,B00JXBLM72,"This anime was already amazing but monica rial as tomoko maid it so much more enjoyable.
Bassicly If you had a hard tim making friend or were awkward during high school you will love this. as i had a hard time in school and tomoko seems very relateble. even to an american audiance.
I originaly watched in japanese on crunchyroll, and have now rewatched the sentai dub.",1413849600,6,369,4.522388059701493
6396403,5,B00JXBLM72,"Watamote is one of those series that comes along every so often that hits on all fronts, artwork, music score, and plot! I loved this series, it was so funny, the jokes are both subtle and in your face. There are also so many other anime series that this particular show parodies, each one hilarious if you can match it to its original work. The basic premise of this story is that we follow a quite socially inept girl named Tomoko Koroki in her transition from middle school to high school. She has never been popular, in fact the exact opposite, but wants to try to become more socially outgoing. What I love about this series is so much of the dialog (some of which is inside Tomoko's own head) is extremely clever. You are kept on your toes with the sometimes quick humor, and the quickly changing situations. My only con about this series was the length, it seems like these little 12 series sets have been more and more common lately. On a positive note, this series wraps up well and doesn't leave you with any glaring questions about the plot, so it was very satisfying for me. There is some fanservice in this and some pretty crude humor, but no nudity so take that for what it's worth. This series is one that stands out for me, it's just a cut above some of the titles that I have seen lately. I highly recommend this series to fans of Haganai or Kokoro Connect, the humor is definitely on par with Haganai. Support the American anime market and pick this series up for a good laugh!",1409616000,5,1495,4.381294964028777
6396404,5,B00JXBLM72,"What more needs to be said than what others have already? If you're shy or have had social anxiety, you'll probably relate to Tomoko. It's funny, it's sad, you'll laugh, you'll cringe, but it's a great ride. I recommend this to both Sub and Dub watchers. The original Japanese dub is the best, but I loved the English voice cast. I really appreciate what Sentai Filmworks did with this. Monica Rial's great as Tomoko. If English Dubs aren't really your thing, then you can always watch it subtitled too.
10/10 Totally worth the price",1409356800,8,533,4.680851063829787
6396405,5,B00JXBLM72,"Tomoko Kuroki is an unpopular girl - she has no friends in school and has trouble talking to anyone outside her family. She not an ordinary, shy, anime girl - she's a misanthrope who envies popular students in her school and hates them at the same time for being popular. Whatever joy she does find is normally only temporary. Watching her struggle through her first year in high school is like watching a baby deer walking for the first time, an immediately stumble cartoonishly into a ditch. Lots of people love Watamote, or hate it, because it seems strikingly similar to some real moments in our lives.

There are times you'll want to shake her and say ""Comb your hair! Stop going to sleep at Four in the Morning! And stop lying, you're only making it worse!""

WataMote is a rare series that is mostly told from the first-person perspective. Tomoko doesn't talk much, you're usually hearing her think. Previously, my problem with Sentai Filmworks was that they didn't match the lip-flaps, they seemed to have dodged the bullet this time. As for the individual voices, they sound fine to me, except for Tomoko's younger brother Tomoki who sounds too old to be a 14 year-old boy. Tomoko herself is played by Monica Rial, (who played May Chang in FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood,) they gave Tomoko a young, but very sickly sounding voice will be very grating for some people. It fits because, Tomoko is not a pleasant person to talk to.

The disappointing part is the lack of special features. You can always do commentaries, Sentai! And stop cramming 9 episodes on a Blu-Ray. This series is expensive for being only 12 episodes. I still had to get it, there will be people talking about Tomoko Kuroki for a long time. (Oh, the irony!) Despite the price, WataMote is a great series to collect, and if you can find the humor in the struggle to come out of your shell, then this one's for you.

I give WataMote a Five-out-of-Five.",1408752000,28,1929,4.6647058823529415
6396406,5,B00JXBLM72,"This is a short series about a 15 year old girl named Tomoko, who desperately wants attention but has crippling social anxiety. That's the plot. Now, it may seem wrong for the show to make fun of someone with social anxiety, but the great balance here is that it's never mean-spirited. Tomoko is  a realisticly flawed character with bad luck, that JUST SO HAPPENS to have said anxiety. It's a great catharthis, to look back on our awkward teens in a much more objective, and funny, light. The entire show is from Tomoko's perspective, and despite Tomoko's lack of redeeming traits, she's incredibly relatable, and one of the most convincingly human characters I've ever seen. We watch through her thoughts and her very real insecurities. Tomoko just wants to sit in her room and consume media all day, but we also here her questions of, ""Is this normal to not have anybody to see?"" Furthermore, nobody's put to ""get"" Tomoko. She simply isn't noticed. But, being a selfish bratty teenager we all were, she doesn't perceive the world as such. The brilliance of this show's humor is that we rarely laugh at the world or the characters. Rather, Tomoko becomes an allegory for ourself, so instead this show is one big nostalgia trip mixed with very dark humor to bring comedic brilliance. If you're looking for intelligent humor and are tired of puns, flashy visuals or vulgarity to create cheap jokes, this is the anime you want.

Packaging/Presentation: 7/10
The packaging for the Blu-ray disc is quite nice actually, and deserves a 10/10, but the menus are so hopelessly plain and lacking of features. There's no marathon mode, meaning every episode must be manually selected, and the menu is just a still image.

Music: 8/10 Nothing irratating, and the tracks can get repetetive, but there are several stand outs, such as the ending tracks, the opening, and a couple of others. It's not going to get you to purchase a CD, but it does its job.

Characters: 10/10 This is the show's shining point. While there are few characters besides Tomoko, Tomoko is one the best fictional characters I've ever seen. It's a bit scary how accurate the portrayal of a anxious, sexually starved teenager is. Also, interactions with Tomoko and her brother Tomoki are quite hilarious.

Voice acting/Dub: 9/10 Monica Rial, who actually plays Bulma in DragonBall Z, Battle of Gods, does an incredible job with Tomoko. She clearly enjoyed doind the dub quite a lot, as energy, tone and voice ranges fit the character perfectly. Another great thing about the english dub is they ab-libbed quite a lot of humor, so you can actually watch the show twice and get two different styles of humor.

Animation: 7/10 Nothing is particularly ugly, but the visuals can be quite bland. Outside of incredible facial expressions for Tomoko not much else is going on here.

Overall: 41/50
A very, very enjoyable show that's well paced, slickly presented and thoughtfully written, if you enjoy dark comedy as well as some sexual humor, this show is a must-watch.

One last thing to note; the TV- MA rating comes with a lot of negative connotations, and I'll explain why it got that. Yes, there is language, but not enough for a typical MA rating. It's slightly less strong than FMA: Brotherhood, so if you can deal with that then this language won't bother you. This is also NO F drops in the english dub whatsoever, which is important to note. The rating comes from the dark and sexual aspects of the humor. Tomoko is very depressed and VERY perverted, so while there is no uncensored nudity, there are many jokes about both male and female genitalia, rape, abuse, incest, fetishes, bisexuality and pedophilia. If this type of humor bothers you, than do not watch this show; but otherwise while it is quite edgy, the show doesn't try to be overtly crass when it comes to sexuality.",1463529600,2,3842,4.793051359516617
6396407,5,B00JXBLM72,"While this is a fair adaptation from the Manga. this series goes WAY over the top.  At first this caught me off-guard.  On the page, the stories are hilarious, but on screen with a voice and sad music attached, it almost makes you sad more than it makes you laugh.  And scenes that were comedy gold as drawn panels are suddenly filled with sad music and a weeping girl's voice.  It's still uproariously funny, and worth a watch, I even liked it more upon repeat viewings.",1456531200,,471,4.441860465116279
6396408,5,B00JXBLM72,"This show is phenomenal! I loved this show so much that I watched and finished the entire show twice in the span of a week! If you are an introvert or otaku then this show is for you. It follows the story of a girl in her first year of high school (or freshman year if you are American like me) who has crippling social anxiety and can't speak to anyone who isn't in her family or her one friend from middle school who goes to a different school. The comedy comes from the main character's razor sharp wit and crushing sarcasm that she only shares with us (in an inner monologue) because she can't talk to anyone else. Tomoko (the main character) is also struggling with her ""primal urges"" for lack of a better term and much of the comedy comes from this side of her character. All in all this show deserves to be recognized as a truly great anime for those who belong in the geek or otaku lifestyle.",1452211200,,900,4.238372093023256

6396414,5,B00JXBLM72,That is all but if you need to know abit more the show is a slice of life anime made perfect about a girl who is socially awkward and wishes to change all that so follow her wacky adventures I don't want to spoil much but trust me the story is alot deeper/relatable so if anything caught your attention add to cart and show her you care,1436054400,,336,4.029850746268656
6396415,4,B00JXBLM72,"This show is an interesting piece of work. Tomoko is probably 90% of the dialogue and is really a sad case. This might hit some otaku a little too close to home. This show does not have much fanservice but the dialogue is quite adult, please note the MA rating.",1435536000,,261,4.24
6396416,2,B00JXBLM72,"When I worked in Japan as a teacher it was very easy to notice the students who struggled socially or were less accepted for whatever reason. I am sure those student struggled with their own private issues but still were engaging and polite when spoke to by teachers and other students. Here is ""Watamote"" a show that depict the life of Tomo Kuroki, a high schooler who is so socially awkward that she has zero friends and spend the bulk of her time having inner dialogue with herself.

Tomo is neither likable nor endearing. One gets that she is very awkward but I couldn't help but feel the character may actually suffer from a form of mentall illness. Taken with flights of fancy, inability to speak to others, curious physical behaviors and a serious deluded sense of reality the show depicts Tomo's misadventures - mostly told through her inner dialogue and depicting the events happening around her reality. Her success and failures socially veer wildly with no real growth or progress leaving the viewer uncertain about how to feel.

I'm not really sure if this show was meant to be comedy or more commentary on social issues in Japan. No matter how over the top the scenarios are you really can't laugh at a character who is suffering so deeply in pain. The episode where she just wants to watch summer fireworks is terribly sad when she realizes she just wants companionship at the fireworks more than just seeing the fireworks themselves.

I now this review will probably not be helpful to many as this show and its manga have a fan base. However, viewing this anime on its merits alone it left me sad and not hopeful for poor Tomo. I couldn't recommend.",1434844800,3,1664,4.653061224489796
6396417,5,B00JXBLM72,"The shows great. Haven't seen a show like this before. I watched it in dub and it was pretty good voice acting. Don't know what the 2 star person was talking about amateur quality and annoying British narrator. The narrator only talked twice and the characters voices fit pretty well. It's worth the buy if your tired of mainstream anime. I had my Japanese wife watch this (subtitled of course) and she found the show hilarious, it's one of her favorites now and still mine.",1434585600,2,474,4.588235294117647

6396422,2,B00JXBLM72,"I loved Watamote when it was airing, and I was really looking forward to hearing a new take on the characters in the English dub. However, this release is a complete spit in the face. Sentai Filmworks are notorious for having no respect for the media they license, and Watamote is one of the more obvious examples of that in recent memory. The ADR is awful in general. None of the VAs' performances are convincing at all. In fact, they're completely amateurish AT BEST. It's worth noting that it seems to be the fault of the director rather than the cast. Still, the casting for Tomoko is embarrassingly bad. Rial's performance sounds like it belongs in a bad ""abridged parody"" rather than an official dub. This is easily one of the worst dubs in years, which is surprising, considering how well the show performed on streaming services while it was airing.

This IS a relative decent release, when compared to some of Sentai's other recent projects. At least you're not shelling over $90 for a trash dub like with Sentai's Chuunibyou release. With that in mind, this release gets two stars.

I'm not asking for perfection, Sentai. I'm really not. But you guys really need to step up your ADR practices, or just dub fewer shows (or both). If you need an outlet for all of your sh***y joke dubs, put them on YouTube or something, because I don't want them on my shelf.",1425081600,2,1367,4.598360655737705
6396423,4,B00JXBLM72,A great for those that like anime that analyze otaku and social culture. Manga is still better.,1423353600,,95,4.647058823529412
6396424,5,B00JXBLM72,"Oh man, this anime. Its almost too painful to watch sometimes. If you are introverted in the slightest, which many people in this hobby can probably declare, you'll get so much appeal in just how painfully relatable this show can be. Tomoko just can't catch a break the entire series, but ends up ok in the end because she's just fine the way she is.
Some of the funniest scenes I've seen in a show, even if I didn't understand some of the many references and parodies.

Anyway really great show, I'm not good at writing reviews just wanted to throw my 5 star rating in the crowd and hopefully get this show noticed a little bit more. It deserves more sales.",1421971200,13,658,4.39344262295082
6396425,5,B00JXBLM72,"Just remember when going into this show, not to take it seriously!
Tomoko is the universe's plaything, she is just part of a cruel cosmic joke, and the only punchline is suffering and futility.

8654432,3,B00JXBLM72,"Watched the show on crunchy roll and wanted to buy this. The subbing on disk is awful in comparison, with strange sentences/word use. Often times definitions will fill the ENTIRE screen with a flash of yellow for two seconds. Rather than rework sentences for  an easy flow that stays true to events, weird bits and pieces seem mashed together of changing whats happening entirely while also given just a Japanese word with a definition. I'm sure its fine if you watch dubbed, its a really good show.",1524441600,,499,4.735632183908046

8654434,5,B00JXBLM72,"Amazing show. I watched this on Hidive Sentai Filmworks new streaming service, and I almost fell out of my chair laughing at it a few times. Heck I ordered this before I was half way done with watching the series on their streaming service. The 2 stars are from kiddos who watched it in fan subs who PGed it up for them. This is an MA ranked anime its why sales sucked in Japan for MA its really mild, and those 2 star kiddos complaining about the dubbs didn't realize even in Japanese this was full of vulgar mature content.

If you can't relate to this you had a horrible lame childhood, to me this pulled heart strings at same time as made me laugh at the pain. I think most who gave this 5 stars had an awkward time in high school or at least freshman year. I mean I tried to reinvent myself like a dozen times in high school to fit in and failed miserably before my senior year where I gave up and was just me. So even though MC (Main character) is a female I could relate well. Add in my little sister was a selective mute who couldn't even order who own pop corn in high school so I got to be her big bro who doubled as her pal and voice in public, and yeah I could totally relate to this.

To me it was like my freshman year, crossed with my little sisters, so it was amazing I had to buy this on the spot. This show is perfect for any one who was a former outcast or still is. Keep in mind not so good for kids or immature adults still an outcast. But as 30 year old outcast of sorts still I loved it, remind me of my youth, and kept laughing at the pain. I mean I was in bad place when I watched this it cheered me up a lot to remind how childish I was worrying about same crap as high schoolers, and laughing at that pain really is great medicine.",1516752000,,1758,3.963276836158192
