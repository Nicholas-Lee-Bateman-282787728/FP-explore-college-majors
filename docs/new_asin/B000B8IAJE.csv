8083407,4,B000B8IAJE,"That's the credo for the series of lighthearted sexy spy spoofs created by Andy Sidaris. If you were a fan of late night cable then chances are you are familiar with his work. A quick review of Andy Sidaris movies. Shot on the cheap,shot quickly,featuring at least a half a dozen Playboy Playmates or Penthouse Pets,studly guys,lots of wild action usually involving guns and or explosives,simplistic if sometimes silly plots,ample nudity and an overall sense of plain fun. This particular 3 disc set features 1988's Picasso Trigger,1990's Guns,and 1994's the Dallas Connection. My favorite is Dallas Connection but Picasso Triggers fun too. Guns is mediocre compared to other Sidaris films. Playboy Playmate Dona Speir stars in Picasso Trigger and Guns while Julie K. Smith and Julie Strain carry the ball in Dallas Connection. I won't take up much space telling you the plots of the 3 films .The basic gist is Speir and her partners( Hope Marie Carlton or Roberta Vasquez) are agents trying to bust various bad guys trying to destroy the world. Samantha Phillps leads the agents in Dallas Connection and Strain's Black Widow is their nemises. Chips alumini Erik Estrada is the villian in Guns the evil Rodrigio Oberegon is the villian in Picasso Trigger and Dallas Connection. If you are a fan of campy not to be taken as art cinema I highly recomend any of the Sidaris films( well up until Day of the Warrior where he started losing it).",1163030400,8,1439,4.877551020408164
8083408,5,B000B8IAJE,"First off, these movies are completely retarded.  They're ridiculous and are far from being quality films, but that doesnt mean they aren't entertaining...  I watched Picasso Trigger and had to change my shirt because I spit beer all over myself when watching the motorcycle ""chase"" scene.  80's Playmates riding motorcross bikes in tank tops (and no bra's!) and using an explosive boomerang to take out one of the bad guys is just one of the highlights.

If you're in to bad dialogue and bad acting, these movies are a gold mine.  Seriously -- RoadHouse, Stone Cold, Point Break, etc. don't even come close.  If the Coen brothers tried to make a bad movie, it'd probably look like these...  I just realized that that's probably an obtuse compliment, even if it may be insulting.  Whatever...  Where can you get three hilariously lame movies for less than 20 bucks?  I highly recommend it.",1141776000,13,889,4.827814569536423
8083409,5,B000B8IAJE,"pacasso trigger, guns, and the dallas connection are the films in this second collection of his films. mr. sidaris was a cameraman for a.b.c. sports for years and on his off times he and his wife made some of the best drive-in movies ever made. i saw them when cable t.v. hit our area in the early 80's and they were great. no deep meaning, just action, and fine looking babes. not for the kids but for the adults who never really grew up. much fun and action to be had here so sit back and just enjoy an actoin and babe packed movie.",1135987200,5,534,4.144230769230769
8083410,5,B000B8IAJE,"I love the andy sidaris films,the action,the girls, its like watching a james bond movie. But why have some of the same movies  from Vol. 1 appear in other volumes? each volume should have totally different movies,and why only 3 movies in the 2nd and 3rd volumes? where is FIT TO KILL,SEVEN,DO OR DIE,and HARD HUNTED in the other volumes? I hope another volume comes out that includes these films.",1135296000,8,397,4.671428571428572
8083411,5,B000B8IAJE,"The rest of the film distribution community could learn a thing or two from the team of Andy and Arlene Sidaris.  They make films with the budget some directors spend on groceries every week, and they do it well.  But if you're reading this, you already know that.  You want to know how the DVD's are, especially since the last four Sidaris movies that didn't see release yet are being released one a piece in each of these new box sets.

Never fear.  Nothing has changed from the previous releases.  Same director's commentaries, same featurettes, same film school lessons.  Hell, even the same menus.  Nothing has changed but the cover art and the packaging, which is also well put together for a multi-disk set.  Everything is secure, and the box is stout and sturdy enough to make it through a rather long shipment without getting jiggled too much.  That's a good thing, because if the contents of the box got jiggled and scratched, then you couldn't watch the intended jiggly parts that the shiny pieces of plastic contain. (It's funny, because I'm talking about breasts.)

The next two sets are listed to come out on Valentine's Day (isn't it appropriate?).  If you keep an eye on them and preorder, each of these sets of three obscenely fun movies can be obtained for less than the cost of the individual movies from the previous distributer.  Buy them.  Buy them good and hard, and help the Sidaris family finance their next picture, Battlezone Hawaii.",1132617600,9,1460,4.742063492063492
