2389848,3,B000AM6P2A,"The film opens with ""Lost in Space"" type of fonts but never spoofs the iconic series or less iconic film. This is a soft core film using hard core stars. The plot concerns foreigners planting something in the space station. Most of the lust is not in space and none is in zero gravity. All the women have at least two sex scenes, except Mary Carey  who has one lone FF scene.

Acting and dialogue was bad. 3 stars for the nudity.",1438732800,3,429,4.219512195121951

2389851,2,B000AM6P2A,"As one would expect from the title and ""actors"" this is a pretty bad film. Oddly it had an interesting plot! I would love to see this plot expanded and done with real actors....attractive ones....as a non rated film.....and with a bigger budget of course.",1431129600,6,255,4.688888888888889
2389852,5,B000AM6P2A,"A funny and sexy movie that don't follow the today common line of lesbian only erotic movies.

The story, the last one from the Erotic Witch Project quadrilogy, is funny, the movie is well made (the scenaios would be better), and the simulated sex scenes really works.

One of the bests movies from Seducion Cinema.",1232755200,4,315,4.709090909090909
