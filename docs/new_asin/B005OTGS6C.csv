4854667,5,B005OTGS6C,"Been waiting years to get classics like The Supergrass on DVD, as our VHS tapes are just about worn out!

Classic alternative British comedy starring French, Sauders, Edmonson, Coltrane, etc. Be warned: This is sarcastic, biting satire on 80's British pop culture. So you may just not get it!",1346889600,,292,4.959183673469388
4854668,5,B005OTGS6C,"I've been waiting and waiting for this set to be available for my region, and now it is. Yes, it was well worth the wait. This outstanding set is bursting with the brilliant work known as The Comic Strip Presents. Talk about a veritable who's who from the British comedy scene: Ade Edmondson, Rik Mayall, Jennifer Saunders, Dawn French, Nigel Planer, Peter Richardson....wow. There's not a dud on the set. But my favorite episodes are Mr. Jolly Lives Next Door, Consuela (that Dawn French is something else), Dirty Movie, Five Go Mad in Dorset, and Beat Generation. But for me, Bad News Tour and More Bad News are the real gems. Edmondson, Richardson, Planer and Mayall are a horrible band looking to make it big and failing miserably, and a documentary crew is along for the ride to capture it all on film. I particularly love Saunders' work as Sally Friedman, England's number one ""chick"" rock journalist.

The ""sequel"" to Bad News Tour is, of course, More Bad News and that's just what you'll get. More Bad News finds the band broken up and doing their own thing before they're invited to reunite for a ""one-off gig at the Flying Horse of all places."" The acrimony and silly antics that broke the band up in the first place come back into play again. And I love it.

This is worth every penny.",1342656000,2,1296,4.581896551724138
4854669,5,B005OTGS6C,I didn't expect that I could find the whole bloody thing in the USA that I could view without a special DVD player!!!  Brilliant 26 hours of good ol' Comic Strip Humour!!!! Well worth it!!!!,1341619200,,190,4.428571428571429
4854670,5,B005OTGS6C,"What a fabulous collection of the best of British comedy. Many hours of fun entertainment, forgot how great these were.",1424217600,,119,5.0
4854671,5,B005OTGS6C,"These shows are more like character studies than comedies and most are filmed like mini movies.  The acting, story development, and great characters all make the series very memorable.

Lots of extras!!!",1410307200,,203,5.3125
4854672,5,B005OTGS6C,"I think The Comic Strip is the finest television comedy ever made. I've owned the British Region 2 dvds since they were released, and I know and love them. These new Region 1 dvds have SIGNIFIGANTLY different edits of several episodes. Fans: you will want to own both sets.

First of all, ""Supergrass"" is MUTILATED. It's in ""widescreen"" which is just a stretched-out picture so everything is flattened! This excellent full-length movie now looks like crap. I can't bring myself to watch it, though it is probably the US VHS version, which I know is different from the R2 dvd release. What a horrible crying shame.

Other than that, the shows on discs 1-5 are exactly the same for Regions 1 and 2, except that some of the R1 episodes include the ""bumpers"" (stills that say ""end of part one"" and then ""part two""). Some bumpers have cute graphics, others are just words. The bumpers for ""Funseekers"" are moving shots with dialogue, very short, not included on the R2 dvds.

Disc 6 is where the big changes are. Some are very different than the R2 dvds. The affected shows are: ""South Atlantic Raiders"" (parts 1 and 2), ""GLC"", and ""Oxford"". (""Spaghetti Hoops"" looks unchanged to me).

Peter Richardson has been quoted about ""tinkering"" with editing some episodes to ""get more laughs"". This is more than ""tinkering"". There is some extra footage and dialogue, also some scenes are cut, and others are moved around to actually change the narrative. Big differences.

For example: The R1 ""SAR"" episodes are longer and better than the R2, with more exposition and back story about the main characters; unfortunately, much of the funny footage of the General in his camp has been cut. (Lemmy has nearly disappeared from the R1 version.) A lame voice-over has been added to Part 2, recapping Part 1. Many small additions and subtractions throughout.

On disc 7, most of the episodes appear to have minor additions and subtractions. In ""Red Nose"", an entire scene is cut. In ""Les Dogs"", just a few tiny additions.

""Four Men In A Car"" has one considerably longer scene, between Jennifer Saunders and Peter Richardson. This always felt chopped up before, so this restoration is a treat.

So really, if you love this stuff as much as I do and want to see it ALL, you need to own both sets.

NOTE this set is not complete! Three subsequent episodes (""Sex Actually"", ""The Hunt for Tony Blair"", and ""Five Go Mad in Rehab"") have been made, and are available on R2 dvd (""The Best of The Comic Strip""). That set also boasts even more edits, to episodes such as ""More Bad News"" and ""Four Men In a Car"". So if you want it all, you've gotta buy that too. And a separate dvd of ""Eat The Rich"". And a NEW feature film is in production this year....",1389571200,11,2723,4.632780082987552

4854674,5,B005OTGS6C,"If you got mTV between 1980-1984, you caught these as BBC reruns in the States. They were awesome because SNL was in such a suck hole of humorless, lazy, coked out oblivion for a few seasons before Myers or Murphy bailed their asses out.
Plus, it was a Brit offering that picked up the ball from the 1970s Monty Python legacy. This ensemble had a completely different structure, context, and vision than Monty Python -- and a much better ""batting average"" with the ratio of sketch comedy hit-or-miss.
French and Saunders kick ass, and all the guys involved knock it out of the park consistently too -- especially in the Beatnik episode.
For an extremely rare collection available NO WHERE else really, not even the torrent world, or the deep net, or the dark net, the 20-40 bucks is well worth it.",1383091200,5,797,4.619718309859155
