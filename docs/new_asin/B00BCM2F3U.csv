5577797,5,B00BCM2F3U,"I loved this.  After every song, I waned to stand and cheer along with the audience!!  The Tenors are my favorite group. My favorite song is Anchor me, but it's hard to choose, they are all wonderful!",1386115200,3,200,4.378378378378378
5577798,5,B00BCM2F3U,"Simply outstanding. The Tenors (formally Canadian Tenors) have the voices of an angelic choir and the sex appeal of a leading romantic movie man. Highly entertaining and well worth the price. I already had the music CD of this show but kept an eye out for it when it finally came out in DVD of the actual performance in Las Vegas. Shop around though because some on the web site sell it for $59.00+ while others make it available for $17.00. I can say however, at whatever price you are willing to pay, it is WORTH EVERY CENT to see and hear this outstanding group in concert.",1385337600,7,576,4.392523364485982

5577802,5,B00BCM2F3U,"I saw the Tenors at Boston Symphony Hall.  I brought my Mom there.  She was MEZMERIZED by them there & again when I put on this DVD.  Both their voices & them as people are so very special.  They give their love of life & music to everyone & when they sing you can not only hear this, but, feel it.......they just pull you in!

Thanks to PBS I was able to give their gift to my Mom & that means a LOT to me(she's 87 yrs young).",1381881600,9,427,3.8068181818181817

5577806,5,B00BCM2F3U,"This was the second concert DVD of theirs I bought; the first being their inaugural concert in Toronto (I believe). I wish I just bought this one as it is so much more polished and professional than the Toronto concert DVD! All four tenors sing beautifully and passionately as well as individual performances throughout. I wish that they hadn't decided to fire Remi from the group after their All-Star performance a few years back. He adds so much depth than what the remaining three offer to their fans, but I sincerely hope the four can reconcile and regroup, as we all would be the benefactors of such grace. Be that as it may, this is one of my favorite concert DVD's I own. You will enjoy it as well. I guarantee it.",1493251200,,721,4.46969696969697

Not being a fan of that kind of music, I was surprised at how I was drawn into the music and thoroughly enjoyed it. I purchased the other The Tenors DVD for my father and plan to have another wonderful time with him watching it.",1390521600,,369,4.0
5577903,5,B00BCM2F3U,"I already had the CD, but the DVD just makes it better. The bonus features make the experience a bit more personal. Really enjoy listening to these guys sing, especially since they seem to enjoy themselves so much. Great addition to my concert DVD's.",1390262400,,250,4.704545454545454

5577905,5,B00BCM2F3U,"THEY WERE THE ""CANADIAN"" TENORS AND EVEN WITH THE NAME CHANGE, THEY ARE JUST AS WONDERFUL.  I LIKE TO IDENTIFY THE VOICES -  EVERY BIT AS GOOD AS MY IL DIVO....",1389398400,,160,4.129032258064516
5577906,5,B00BCM2F3U,Parts of this performance will bring tears to your eyes and take away your ability to speak.  It's that beautiful.,1389312000,,114,4.7
5577907,5,B00BCM2F3U,Yes but waiting  for some more albums to come out. I could think of a thousand songs these guys could sing and sound great.,1389139200,,123,4.125

5577909,5,B00BCM2F3U,"You will not be disappointed. I had never heard their music and had the opportunity to see them live and wow! I just had to get them on DVD to watch over and over. Super talented singers, each with their own style that compliments one another. And they're an amazing bunch of guys -- humanitarians, comedians and musicians (beyond just singing!).

YOU JUST GOTTA GET IT!! Steal of a DVD!",1388275200,,387,4.5285714285714285
5577910,5,B00BCM2F3U,He had this recorded on our DVR and a power surge during a storm removed it and he really missed it as he watched it many many times to relax. This gift made him very happy.,1387497600,,173,3.8333333333333335
5577911,5,B00BCM2F3U,"I gave them 5 stars only because I couldn't make it 5 million! I'm so in love with these guys and this video showcases everything about them that is so wonderful!!!! Beautiful men singing beautifully! Omg! In French, Italian and English, perfection!!",1386979200,3,250,4.976190476190476

5577913,4,B00BCM2F3U,"Very good indeed. Worth the Money. But it is not perfect. I really wanted it to be perfect.
a) there are no subtitles - b) too much talking (guess this is a trend) and c) THERE ARE NO SUBTITLES.
Extras - 45 minutes about the show and their lives.
Some extra songs from the same show are in the ""extras"". Why??
But it is good - and I'll watch it two more times, tops.",1386633600,,366,3.9594594594594597

Quality of the production could have been a bit better but othrrwise, loved it.",1520812800,,202,4.8
8566013,1,B00BCM2F3U,"Not the Tenors that I wanted.
Was grouped with the Texas Tenors.

8566015,3,B00BCM2F3U,"Although there were some songs that were nice, I really didn't go for their music.  I also don't like their stage persona.  The guy with the hat really doesn't do much for me.  If he's bald, he's bald.  So am I.",1515369600,,211,4.073170731707317
8566016,3,B00BCM2F3U,"Others may like it better, but for me, this tries too hard and unsuccessfully to straddle the range between pop and operatic. The guys are pretty decent singers and might have done better with different material and arrangements, so they get 3 stars for that, but too much of the performance reminds me of H. L. Mencken's observation that ""Nobody ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public."" The original ""3 Tenors"" DVDs with Pavarotti, Domingo, and Carreras are all more to my liking.",1512604800,,507,4.906976744186046

EACH SONG THEY SING IS JUST INCREDIBLE.  THE ORCHESTRATION IS SO WELL DONE AND WHOEVER DOES THEIR MUSIC ACCOMPANIMENT IS A GENIUS.  I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT THEM.  THEY'RE THAT GOOD.,1503619200,,359,5.120689655172414
