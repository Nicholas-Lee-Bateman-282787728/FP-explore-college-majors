8015681,5,B0001OGVBW,"This is presented in a restored black and white version, not color as amazon states is it's format. BUT, that is perfectly alright with me as it is in great condition as it brings back the good ol' days. I found the sound quality to be quite good as well. This is definately a must have DVD collection for Gene Autry fans of all ages. Plus with a bargain of 8 movies for $8.99, how can you go wrong?",1144108800,2,399,4.063291139240507
