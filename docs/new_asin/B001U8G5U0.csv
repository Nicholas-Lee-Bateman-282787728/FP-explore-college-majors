3797372,4,B001U8G5U0,"I have been a Mariah fan since the very beginning. This is the peak of her vocal abilities. She completely out does herself on every song. I was, and still am, infatuated with the entire Daydream era. The DVD quality is fantastic, not Hi-Def by any means, but things weren't shot in Hi-Def back in '96. A must have for any ""true"" Mariah fan!!",1345852800,3,342,4.359375
3797373,5,B001U8G5U0,"The DVD was great.  I loved Mariah's performance.  I was worried when I was purchasing the DVD because there was hardly any description but it is what I thought it was.  It is the Tokyo performance in 1996 during the Daydream World Tour.  It contains notable performances like the rarely performed ""I Don't Wanna Cry,"" the energetic ""Fantasy,"" the SOS Band cover, ""Just Be Good To Me,"" the segue from a ballad to energetic dance version of ""Anytime You Need a Friend,"" the closing ""All I Want for Christmas Is You, and a brief interview in the end.  It is cute to see Mariah connect with a Japanese audience and she was at the prime of her career.  The only thing I don't like about the DVD is the fact that the front cover doesn't have a picture of Mariah in that concert, so it could be misleading.  But other than that, it is the DVD of the performance I wanted and it came in great condition.",1289088000,19,896,4.3293413173652695

8343150,5,B001U8G5U0,I loved it to be honest. The concert is from 1996 so don't mind the cover because its not the correct concert. It was an awesome dvd and i do recommend it.,1424736000,,155,3.875

8343153,5,B001U8G5U0,"Typically, I do not buy DVDs or CDs that are not official releases from the record label. However, this concert, from Mariah's 1996 Daydream World Tour, is a highlight performance in her career and I no longer have high quality video files of it; so I decided to go ahead and purchase this DVD.

As for the product itself: The DVD is excellent quality. I haven't watched these performances in such good quality in a long time. The packaging is good. My only criticism is that I do not know why there is a picture from 2005 being used as the cover for a concert from 1996. However, the back cover and inserts contain some shots from the concert itself, as well as a nice synopsis of Mariah's career as of the release year of 2009. Also, the title itself is rather vague, as Mariah has performed in Tokyo multiple times, but the back cover explains which concert it is.

As for the content: This concert is a MUST HAVE for all devoted Mariah fans. This show was one of three sold-out shows at the Tokyo Dome in March 1996; all three shows sold out in record time. Mariah performs highlights from her ""Daydream"" album, which she was supporting at the time, and most of the hits from her first four albums, including an encore of ""All I Want For Christmas Is You,"" which was massively successful in Japan. Among the standout performances are ""I Don't Wanna Cry,"" ""Underneath the Stars,"" and ""Anytime You Need A Friend,"" in which Mariah combined the soulful album version with the C&C Music Factory remix. She also covers the SOS Band's ""Just Be Good To Me.""

If you are a diehard fan, this is an essential addition to your collection; and if you are a more casual fan, this is an excellent item to have to expose you to some great live renditions of Mariah's early hits.",1379548800,3,1766,4.461300309597523
8343154,5,B001U8G5U0,"Awesome concert! Mariah is in top form an old concert most people haven't seen! Every song is amazing, I love it!",1377388800,,113,4.428571428571429
8343155,5,B001U8G5U0,"I love it. I love Mariah and I love this concert. The front cover is inaccurate, but what matters is the DVD, which is great.",1372118400,,125,4.04
