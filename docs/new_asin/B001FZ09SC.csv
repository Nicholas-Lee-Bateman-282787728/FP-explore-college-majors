8303121,5,B001FZ09SC,"i don't have the blu-ray yet but the movie itself is about earth being on the verge of anhilation by alien beings the size of star-destroyers.  they consume a stars life as they use them to breed.  the film follows a girl struggling to make the ranks of a mecha army unit and her perception of the passage of time.  whenever she journeys into space and moves at light speed, time speeds up for those she leaves behind.  so she will leave earth at 18 and come back weeks later to find her friends have grown older and have kids.  this makes the film very weepy to watch, as she just gets thrown further away from her own natural earth timeline.  its very epic- the end sees the planet jupiter turned into a black-hole-bomb and ends several thousand years later.  this older stuff if made for blu-ray.",1373241600,3,799,4.394557823129252

Gunbuster is a classic 1980's science fiction anime from studio Gainax (Evangelion).  It's about Earth being attacked by space monsters, a couple of cutesy Japanese heroines (a bit too cutesy/histrionic at times though), lots of robots having kick-ass battles against massive aliens, and more.  Gunbuster well-done take on a common story, with some brilliant artwork and amazing animation sequences that have a mind-boggling amount of detail.  Storytelling in the early part of the movie has some info gaps (Jung's background story has been edited out) with much of the film about the characters, the passage of time and it's effects, and how people react to an impending alien apocalypse.

Gunbuster The Movie is the only HD version released in North America.  The first 30mins seemed more like an upscaled DVD; not bad looking, but not quite Blu-ray wow.  Maybe because the earlier part of the movie is from the oldest individual episode.  However, the quality picks up to HD pretty quickly.  I have no overall complaints about the video quality with the final part in the story being widescreen and in black & white to add greater impact.  The sound is also superb Japanese Dolby Digital 5.1 or PCM with English subtitles. Apparently, the original cast re-dubbed their parts for Gunbuster: the movie.  No English dubbing here.

Since the film's the result of 6 episodes of OVA edited together (see link above), it's been edited for time and pacing.  If you've never seen the original OVAs then you may not feel like you're missing out, but because of several scenes being cut the films pace is greatly increased.  The editors could have left just a bit more in, but the story is far from destroyed.  Also, the short animated ""Science Lessons"" at the end of each OVA are no longer on the disc at all.. should have been an extra.  Maybe they're easter eggs on the disc somewhere.

If you're interested in this movie consider this: If having a complete/uncut version of the film is more important, then get the DVD set.  If picture quality and a streamlined story is preferable, than this blu-ray is for you.  It's a fantastic anime, but I wouldn't pay any more than $30.00 for it.",1275782400,17,2417,5.16452442159383
