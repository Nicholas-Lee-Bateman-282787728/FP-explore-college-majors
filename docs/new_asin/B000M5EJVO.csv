8166589,5,B000M5EJVO,"Naturally any film media can not place the entire book on the screen with maybe the exception of ""Hamlet"" (1996). With anything less than a mini-series. Second is it the story or the philosophy that needs to be transmitted? If you are lucky you get both.

In this case we are lucky because both the basic story and the basic philosophy were transmitted in this movie. An added plus, you could say double plus good, was the portraying the environment as a period piece as described in the book and not as some modern version. The story ""1984"" was envisioned in 1948.

-------------------------------------------

In a society that has eliminated many imbalances, surplus goods, and even class struggle, there are bound to be deviates; Winston Smith (John Hurt) is one of those. He starts out, due to his inability to doublethink, with thoughtcrime. This is in a society that believes a thought is as real as the deed. Eventually he graduates through a series of misdemeanors to illicit sex (Suzanna Hamilton) and with the help of an encouraging inter party member (Richard Burton) even plans to overthrow the very government that took him in as an orphan.

If he gets caught, he will be sent to the ""Ministry of Love"" where they have a record of 100% cures for this sort of insanity. They will even forgive his past indiscretions.

This version is a little more graphic than the other two earlier commercial movies. However each movie version brings a different emphasis on this classic story. There is a 2007 version in the works

Read a review of the book ""1984"" by George Orwell. The movie can stand on its own merit, but knowledge of the book will help fill in the gaps and explain the inferences. Better actors could not have been picked. Richard Burton is in his element.

Many people think this is happening today.",1507334400,8,1867,4.867507886435331

8166591,5,B000M5EJVO,"The movie 1984 is as dark and foreboding as Orwell's original book. John Hurt and Richard Burton depict Winston and O'Brien well. Hamilton makes for an excellent Julia. The performances of these actors make this film believable and quite effective. There are some great lines in this movie. The dialogue between Hurt and Burton towards the end might make you cringe (given the setting) but it is memorable.

The screenplay follows the book closely, and focuses on the most important passages, a necessity due to the time constraints of any movie. This movie is long, but how could one make a short version of this story worth watching? The lighting and soundtrack add to the atmosphere or dread and gloom.

The messages conveyed by the book emerge from the dialogue and performance of the actors. The sets it was filmed on match this mood aptly. This is a rare instance where the movie version of a great story is as worthwhile as the book it drew upon. Though it is depressing, it is a profound and unique film that all who appreciate fine cinematography should watch.",1190851200,10,1069,4.741935483870968
