3046338,5,B00104AYOW,Jack Benny was one of the greats. He is hilarious while not being obscene. Why can't they make them like this anymore.,1277078400,18,118,4.409090909090909
3046339,3,B00104AYOW,"The first thing I noticed when we received these was you do get 5 disks but there are only 4 shows per disk.  So be prepared not to receive a lot of shows.  Price seems high for only 20 shows.  The quality of the video ranged from poor to good.  Some where obvisouly just a film of a TV monitor shot when the show was aired live, which was quite common in the 1950's.  Later shows were on film and were good quality.  Shows ranged from 1954 to 1960.

The material is of course classic Jack Benny and still makes you laugh, particulary the Lucky Strike commericals which are included in some episodes (you can show your kids what TV was like in primitive times).

There are no special features, not even chapter breaks.  I wish they would do for Jack Benny what they did for I Love Lucy, those disks are packed with features, chapters, restored, etc.  More than you ever expected.  Oh Well.",1231632000,69,889,4.327272727272727

8237008,5,B00104AYOW,"I love The Jack Benny Program.  The show is fantastic and packed with many wonderful actors, a good number with recurring roles such as Mel Blanc, Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson most notable.  Don Wilson and Dennis Day have great additions to Jack's ongoing mayhem.  The many guest are outstanding.  Robert Goulet, Smothers Brothers, Bob Hope, George Burns, Raymond Burr, Madge Blake, Jesslyn Fax, Bea Bernadette and so many more.",1473552000,,426,5.220588235294118

8237012,5,B00104AYOW,"I discovered Jack Benny while watching late night television.  His timing is wonderful and his ""forward"" thinking with Rochester as a co-star makes me enjoy the show even more.

Sometimes when you need a good laugh, watch the episode with Humphry Bougart (sp) as a criminal and Jack as the Chief of Police doing an interrogation.  TOO, TOO, FUNNY!",1437868800,,347,4.8474576271186445

8237016,3,B00104AYOW,I love Jack Benny but this collection is disappointing in the fact that the episodes have not been cleaned up and there are so few episodes available. A complete digitally remastered series would be a great idea.,1388188800,,212,4.756756756756757
