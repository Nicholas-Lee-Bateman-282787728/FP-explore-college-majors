8544718,5,B009WSART0,I enjoyed this movie enough to buy it multiple times and give it to people to enjoy. The characters are more than just easy stereotypes. The music is great. The film has a very unique look and feel to it.,1466553600,,204,4.125
8544719,5,B009WSART0,"Although few people outside of Austin, Texas would recognize this cast of local celebrities, this is not a film to be overlooked.  With a complex storyline, subtle spiritual themes, and a main character who is flawed yet somehow likable, this is a gem of film.",1354233600,,260,4.777777777777778
