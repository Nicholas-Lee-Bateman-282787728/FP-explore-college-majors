In the late 19th century there was an epic struggle between the great cattle barons and the independent ranchers. Would the lords of money and power wipe out the small ranchers and expropriate public lands for their own use? A few men prevented this to keep the western lands free.

The story begins with cowboys herding horses. A house burns, gun shots are exchanged. Another small rancher is put out of business. Others have their horses stolen after getting the same warning. The range war goes on, there is no proof of guilt. The small ranchers hold a meeting, they send for Tim Corwin (a hired gunman). A young boy wants to grow up fast. Walton is told about the meeting by his spy; he wants Tim Corwin stopped and offers $1,000 for his killing. But this man isn't fast enough. So Walton accuses Tim of murder! The Sheriff finds the gun in the dead man's hand: self-defense.

That young boy practices shooting at tin cans. Tim will stay in that isolated cabin in the mountains. Later men ride to that ranch house looking for Barry. Walton asks Tim to leave the area. They plot to get rid of Tim, or stop May Carter from arriving. Tim suspects a trick at the telegraph office, and asks for a handwriting sample. ""You won't need these for a while."" Tim escorts May Carter to the Morgan ranch by a roundabout way. There is a selection for dinner. Will they be safe there? Will a man shoot Bob Morgan so they can blame Tim? Will the gangs sneak up on Tim? Can Walton get May Carter to sell her ranch? Can they trap Tim at a set-up meeting? Will that young boy hear the scheme and warn Tim?

Tim arrives early to catch those who would trap him. Tim learns of Evans' treachery. Range wars are handled by the Coroner, not the Sheriff. Tim looks for Walton and Evans. People run away from the street. The ambush fails. Tim sends a telegram to report the success of his mission. He will start a new career.

""The Banditti of the Plains"" is a little known book about a terrorist invasion of 1890s Wyoming. This story inspired countless novels and movies that entertained a generation of Americans, and also taught a moral lesson. Tim McCoy is little known today, he seems an authentic character for a western.",1276905600,,2229,4.480295566502463
