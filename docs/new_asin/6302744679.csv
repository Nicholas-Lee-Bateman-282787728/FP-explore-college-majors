7832071,2,6302744679,"Plot:  Capt. Picard is contacted by his friend Walker Keel and he heads off to a planet for a secret meeting.  After being cross-examined with some trick questions, Picard is told by Keel that there is some funny business happening in Starfleet.  Despite his unsurity, Picard asks Data to do some research on the command structure in Starfleet.  Data does find some anamolies, saying that they may suggest a conspiracy (hence the very simple and yet complex title for the episode).  Sudddenly, they find Keel's starship...in a couple hundred pieces.  Apparently, it had self-destructed.  Picard then heads back to Earth and talks with some of the Admirals and see what's going on.  Adm. Quinn (who had hinted similar dark things to Picard in ""Coming of Age"") is now different, as in, ""that whole dark, forbidding, info I gave you was really not a big deal"", so Picard warns Riker that Quinn is not the same.  After Quinn gets into a fight with Riker (who gets knocked out), Geordi (who gets thrown through a door), and Worf (who, for some reason, can't beat the crazed admiral), Dr. Crusher shoots him several times with a phaser.  They then do some examing of Quinn and find that he's being controlled by a parasite....

I'm really being nice for giving it 2 stars instead of 1.

Good points:  It's a follow up on another episode, it has plenty of action and phaser fire, it is somewhat suspensful.

Bad points:  It's really violent and even gross (head being blown off, some of the food, the parasites, etc.).  It has several flaws logically:  Adm. Quinn is still human, so there's no possibility for him to suddenly have super strength without damaging himself permantely (and thus giving the parasites a problem in terms of fighting); the need for the phasers being set to kill doesn't make sense since, like the super strength problem, the physical characteristics would still be stunned by the blast (unless, you could maybe say the parasites could keep their hosts consciouness longer than an oridinary human could); that Adm. Quinn even started the whole fight in the first place (did he seriously expect that he could take on the whole ship?  I mean, with phasers, explosives, and Data?); that the mother-parasite is so big (like as in, bigger than a bread box) since they're supposed to take over by attatching to where the spine and brain meet.  It also has a similar ring to what happened in Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan, although this invovles more of some parasites actually taking over peoples minds for their purposes and not Khan's.

Like I said, 2 stars is really being nice and I'm grateful that they found a better villian for the Enterprise and Federation to challenge in the long run (i.e. the Borg).",1157846400,,2726,4.745222929936306
7832072,5,6302744679,"This was one of the best first season TNG episodes. It was something quite unique and different in the Star cannon: a gory, terrifying descent into madness by way of bug eating, back stabbing (figuratively and literally), and true conspiracy theories. The video cover picture on Conspiracy of Riker pretty much sums the episode up. Well, of course, so does the infamous exploding head scene. Is there any other Star Trek episode that you can say that about?",1045267200,,457,4.871794871794871
7832073,5,6302744679,"This is a controversial episode among Trekkies, but I absolutely love every minute of it. The conspiracy hinted at in the episode ""Coming of Age"" finally comes full circle and Picard must now go back to Earth to confront the heads of Starfleet. What ensues is a TNG episode like none other! Lots of action, creepy stuff, and some pretty ooky special effects. This is a very dark episode, however, and the ending isn't quite the cheery resolution Trekkies are generally used to. But that's why I like it. It takes new risks and does new things with Star Trek that hadn't really been done before. It's one of my favorite episodes.",1043107200,,628,4.616071428571429
7832074,2,6302744679,"This episode starts out promising with the story of a conspiracy that reaches up into the highest eschelons of the Federation, and Captain Picard's mission to investigate.
As the plot unfolds, we find that the Federation is being usurped by wormlike parasites that take over high ranking officials, and it is here that the disappointment sets in.  As usual the Federation is still portrayed as a utopian organization, and the first episode to hint at a dystopian future fizzles because the humans are essentially blameless, so once again the Federation is uncompromised by human fear or greed.
Contrast this episode with ""Ensign Ro"" where Picard will match wits with a rogue Admiral who is acting against Federation policy.  That was a much better episode that explored similiar themes.",1015891200,6,786,5.1328125
7832075,5,6302744679,"Among Star Trek fans ""Conspiracy"" remains one of the most controversial.  The premise of a covert plan by alien beings to infiltrate and control the minds of key Star Fleet personnel is eerily handled as one by one, Captain Picard and crew find themselves confronted by ""possessed"" officers.
There are several really gross scenes, the last of them being the ""revelation"" of the host alien.  Why there was not a sequel to this one is one of the series' mysteries.
All in all, however, this one is a keeper.",975283200,7,505,4.662921348314606
7832076,4,6302744679,"What struck me as being the good thing about this episode was that they set it up several episodes before hand, when an Admiral makes an offhand remark to Picard that he wants to talk to him about a new threat to the Federation.  In this episode, he waves it off, but the destruction of a Federation Star ship, plus the Admiral beating Riker uncounscious, shows that something is amiss.
Another thing that I noticed, from my limited experience with the Original Series, is that as we go on, Starfleet seems less and less invincible.  This episode shows that they can be infiltrated by small things; 'Best of Both Worlds' showed they can get whipped; and the end seasons of DS9 showed that Starfleet could go to war and kick hard.  But what i didn't like was that they set up, at the end, the possibility that something else was coming, but they didn't follow through.  I may be wrong (if I am, let me know) but nothign ever came of what could have been a great plot line.",972432000,9,971,4.407821229050279
