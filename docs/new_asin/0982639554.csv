7795096,5,0982639554,"I am someone who lives with unwanted same sex attractions. I believe what the Bible says that homosexuality is wrong. I first heard Sy Rogers speak at a conference put on by an ex-gay live in program that I was part over 10 years ago. What struck me was his humor and his ability to shatter my American Christianity with the truth of Gods word. I have since then acquired all of Sys materials. He has been the number one influence in my life on my journey out of homosexuality.
I have watched the DVD and listened to the CD of Just One Of The Boys many times. Sy is a powerful communicator. In this DVD he shares is personal story of how God brought him out of homosexuality. He shares through the Bible how God is in the business of redeeming sexuality. Sy has devoted his life to this ministry for over 21 years.
I would highly recommend this product to anyone with a sexual struggle. It is also useful to any church, family member or friend wanting to help them.",1432771200,4,965,4.3076923076923075
7795097,5,0982639554,"There is so much I can say that is great about this testimony.  I do not think you could possibly find a more obvious demonstration of the power of love than in the life Of Sy Rogers.  It is the power of transformation.  But, in addition to that, Sy has a unique and gifted way of communicating. He might be the best orator I've ever heard, as he combines excellence in delivery with humor and heart-wrenching reality.  In the end you will be changed forever, changed in the way you see the love of our Almighty Creator at work in His perfect timing, and proof that all things DO WORK for the good of those who love God and are called according to His purpose.  The testimony of Sy Rogers is a story about love and transformation, and how you do not have to overlook the sin to love the sinner.  GET IT!",1428969600,5,803,4.215686274509804

This testimony will not only encourage you in your own walk, reminding you of the power of God, but it will also encourage you if you have any friends or family members that are living homosexually.

7795099,5,0982639554,"I had the Video sitting in my living room for months after a GF (reformed lesbian) had urged me to watch it and went on about how great it was. Honestly the cover didn't look interesting and I wasn't interested in the homosexual issues, at the time. However, for some reason I picked it up and put it in and I was literally blown away by this man of God! I found myself on the couch listening to him and just started crying and praising God with my arms in the air! Seriously one, if not the most moving testimonies I have ever heard! Initially I was like, man I think this guy is still a little flambouyant, if you know what I mean, but after listening to his story he became transformed before my very eyes and became one of the most beautiful people I have ever heard share there life story. Needless to say there was a reason God had me watch this as my best freinds son soon came out and Sy was a cornerstone to his healing and deliverance from homosexuality. My friends son, some 5,6 or so years later is now employed as a Pastor, and is going on to get his Masters in christian counselling. Oh and he is happily married and no homosexual feelings whatsoever. He too is a masterpiece for God. I strongly urge you to order his video! We took a slew of cars on a road trip to NC to actually watch one of his conferences I would highly recommend going to that as well. He is one fabulous speaker, teacher and true man of God! Very inspiring..... ***** I can't believe he is not more known! And on the other hand I am truly disappointed that the Christian churches haven't used this man more he has so much knowledge for the church to understand and appreciate about those who struggle with this sin. He really gives you a heart for homosexuals! I see them totally different now as in there brokeness and hopelessness. I could go on and on.",1278633600,11,1842,4.265714285714286
