The movie was played way to seriously(its supposed to be a comedy) I mean Roscoe and Boss Hogg were just downright nasty in this film,unlike the TV show where it was just good ol' fun,as for Starsky and Hutch,I loved it from stem to stern,more recommended than the Dukes! I still give it five stars because you get 2 movies on one DVD,a pretty good deal for the $,and there BOTH WIDESCREEN,A MAJOR +",1237420800,3,764,4.930232558139535
