2400152,5,B000B5IPEC,"""Every"" street corner in 1950's America had a young guy like either of the characters played by Steve McQueen in Baby, the Rain Must Fall & The War Lover.

These were memorable personalities whose daring toughness were admired by the guys, and who were obsessively loved by the slavish prom queen beauties whom they mistreated.

There must be something magnetic about the smoldering bad-boy type. And, yes, they wound up often enough in prison stripes, or interred in Arlington Cemetery after a hero's funeral.

If they live long enough they become doting grand- fathers",1366675200,2,570,5.042553191489362
2400153,5,B000B5IPEC,"It was intersting & a bit memererizing to see McQueen playing a Rock & Roll singer.  His perforance was hard to describe, but well worth watching.  He had a cool presents (a cool) that few actors can match or come close to matching.  I like Steve McQueen as an actor.  All of his movies have been good.  Recently I have seen 7 of his movies - all have been purchased through the Amazon web site.",1361577600,,395,4.213333333333333
2400154,5,B000B5IPEC,"I have this set, but I didn't get here and while I'm reviewing on this I'm looking right at it. This is a great set of DVDs starring Steve McQueen. This is a great deal for the price and each movie comes in their own slim case with artwork. ""Baby, the Rain must Fall"" is in Widescreen (1.85:1) and ""The War Lover"" is in both Wide and Full mode, they are also in B/W and they run for about 102mins each. For ""The War Lover,"" after you select play it will take you to a selection of Widescreen or Full screen, so you can choose what you'd like to see. By the way, I will upload some pictures of the cases. These are two great films and I would recommend these and this set to anyone. Overall this is great and a must have.",1333065600,17,720,4.006944444444445

2400156,4,B000B5IPEC,"I recently purchased this two disc box set because I realized my Mcqueen collection was severely lacking especially in regards to his early work. At any rate the two films in question are great peaks into a younger less fine tuned Mcqueen, before he became a huge hollywood icon. Don't expect a lot of extras, the discs come with next to none just some trailers from unrelated movies and an ad for his TV show Wanted Dead or Alive. All in all though, if you were as curious as I was as to how he went from little known stage actor to one of the most idolized actors of all time check these out. I was pleasantly surprised.",1243036800,12,622,4.279661016949152

How can you not love both his characters from 'Baby, the Rain Must Fall' and the 'The War Lover' !! Movies from that era are blessed with a lot of very good speaking parts for the characters. both are actors movies.",1367366400,6,374,4.208333333333333

8081507,5,B000B5IPEC,"THE WAR LOVER is another war film with a love triangle at its center, but with a twist. This time Steve McQueen, Robert Wagner and Shirley Ann Field are the lovers caught in the web and it is a web of love, survival, living the moment and war. Steve McQueen's unique style and slant and the excellent aerial photography of the B 17s on their bombing runs are this film's greatest assets and make it a must for lovers of this genre. This is a British film and it looks and feels like it, which only adds to the authenticity. Highly underrated and forgotten these days.

BABY, THE RAIN MUST FALL is an interesting character study with Steve McQueen as a man who cannot escape his demons from the past who set him on the wrong path in life. McQueen is a drifter and paroled convict who dreams of songwriting and meets up with his small daughter and wife (Lee Remick) in Columbus, Texas in the the early 60s. The tumbleweed and dust blown environment seem to eat away at McQueen along with the terms of his parole and some dark secrets from his childhood. Elmer Bernstein's sensitive, vibrant and psychological score heighten the complex narrative. Don Murray and Paul Fix gives strong supporting performances as deputy sheriff and judge and they add great depth to the texture of this forgotten film directed by Robert Mulligan.",1453766400,,1325,4.614406779661017
