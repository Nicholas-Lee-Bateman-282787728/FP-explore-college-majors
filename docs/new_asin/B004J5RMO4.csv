4390562,5,B004J5RMO4,"I grew up watching The Little Rascals & always loved them. I saw this collection & knew I had to get it-so glad I did. We spent a rainy, cold Saturday curled up on the couch, watching one disc after another. We laughed till we cried as we watched Alfalfa, Darla, Spanky & Buckwheat in all their innocent fun glory. In a world full of computers, i-phones, wii games & the like, it's so nice to see kids being kids & having fun going wherever their imaginations take them.",1324252800,,470,4.292134831460674

4390564,5,B004J5RMO4,"Bill Cosby was wrong to deny kids of our times the legacy of the original Little Rascals. Claiming these movies stereotyped blacks in a negative way, the fact is that they represent a historical record of American society during the Great Depression suffered not only by blacks but whites as well. The entire collection should be preserved as a National Treasure. That said, it's a joy to watch the mayhem these kids caused, the wholesome fun they had and transmitted to the viewer. All this without electronic games or equipment - magic, pure and simple. ""Honky Donkey"", ""Fly My Kite"", ""Hi, Neighbor"", ""Free wheeling"", ""Fish Hooky"" and ""Choo-Choo"" are just brilliant! That's just the short list... You can't go wrong with this collection. Enjoy!",1317168000,3,746,5.024193548387097
4390565,5,B004J5RMO4,"had no idea what to expect before purchasing this Little Rascals collection but the price was so reasonable, I knew I didn't have much to lose. Wow, pleasantly surprised when I viewed it..Episodes are indeed in rich black and white as the title describes,and are exactly as I remember them from my childhood. This set brought back so many fond memories for me and created many laughs for my whole family. I even got my 8 and 10 year olds to enjoy it and now they are actually asking to watch it. Its nice for me to re-live something from my youth together with my kids!
I can recommend this collection for all ages and for the whole family..",1304380800,15,641,4.394957983193278
4390566,5,B004J5RMO4,"I used to have a few VHS tapes of the Little Rascals, or Our Gang. The series was Cabin something or other, and you can't find those anywhere anymore. I've always loved these timeless shows, and wanted to find a good box-set of them. After looking at several different products and reading lots of reviews, I decided to take a risk and give this one a try. It had lots of episodes (including the ones I especially loved and cherish) and it was relatively cheap. If it turned out to be over-edited or anything, I wasn't really out so much money. I haven't watched all 87 episodes yet, but everything I've watched is just as I remember. If you're looking for a good collection of the Little Rascals, this is one you should definitely get:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Little-Rascals-Collectors-Edition-87-Episodes-With-DVD-Menus-in-RICH-BLACK-AND-WHITE/dp/B004J5RMO4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Little Rascals-Collectors Edition-87 Episodes-With DVD Menus- in RICH BLACK AND WHITE</a>",1304035200,34,1035,5.953020134228188

4390569,5,B004J5RMO4,"I am so excited to have received this so quickly! I am in Germany and really needed some good laughs (our dog died the day before I ordered this). It arrived within 2 weeks and works with the European DVD player.

Picture quality is good. When I say good, I mean it is just as I remember it from the old UHF TV station I watched the Little Rascals on  in the 1970s. Don't forget that some of these are over 70 years old. It's not Blu Ray. But the sound and picture quality are perfectly acceptable for remastered b/w films.

If you're looking at this and know the shorts, I don't have to tell you how great they are. If you don't know them, this is a good first purchase.

Really worth the money (including the little bit extra for shipping to Europe). I am very pleased.

4390581,5,B004J5RMO4,".. but I ordered them anyway.  I knew the video quality would not be great, but I was actually surprised that it was not as bad as I thought it would be.  I grew up with the Little Rascals and finding them on DVD was a dream come true. What I don't understand is that all film was actually ""filmed"" on film back then so there should be no degradation in quality, like you get from copying VHS over and over.  I suppose the original, or even copies have long been lost or hidden away for what ever reason so we have to either rely on video tape or recordings from a TV broadcast.  Also, I didn't as a child, nor now as a fifty something adult, find the series as being racial.

2) DISK #9 is missing.

4390585,2,B004J5RMO4,"This review refers the DVD of The Little Rascals Collector's Edition which was
released by ATI in 2009 (87 episodes on 11 dvds). I purchased this collection strictly based on the very positive reviews here on amazon.com

My experience was one of disappointment. I can live with the fact that they are not in chronological order, but the MGM logo has been removed from every short thus the music begins abruptly. As one short ends, the next one begins with not so much as a few seconds in between. The opening title is missing on the short entitled Bed Time Worries. The picture quality varies from short to short. The contrast is decent for the most part, but there is no sharpness to most of them - the focus is on the soft side. However, my biggest complaint is with the sound on many of these shorts: there are plenty of snaps, crackles and pops and surface noises to distract from one's enjoyment. A couple of shorts have no sound at all for the first 20 seconds or more.

I have tried to be as fair as possible in this review, but if I were their teacher, I could only give a C+ to these Little Rascals mainly because of the very reasonable price and the number of shorts included. Perhaps I expected too much after having read the glowing reviews. I was hoping for the superior quality of the beautiful Laurel And Hardy Essential Collection (released by RHI 2011), which I highly recommend.

I haven't seen them all, but I think the picture quality and sound are better
on the Little Rascals: The Complete Collection (2008).",1334966400,31,1530,4.516245487364621

4390588,5,B004J5RMO4,"Hi

I been searching for the Littl Rascals uncut version and I believe this is it !

I went straight to ""Washee Ironee"" Disc 3 and low and
behold it's not cut up !

Nice to have a menu where you can jump to any short
you want .

I didn't watch all of them as I just recieved them but from
looking at Disc 3 the quality and sound is great considering
The Rascals are 80 years old.

Do yourself a favor and grab this set before it's too late..you
won't be sorry.

There's a reason why every rating is 5 stars and all from verified purchases !

Looking forward to a free relaxing day to watch all the DVD's and laugh
along with ""Our Gang"" and think of the memories we had as
kids when us kids played outside and used our imagination !",1333411200,5,731,3.9657534246575343
4390589,5,B004J5RMO4,"There are many, many, many Little Rascals DVD sets out there,but you have to be careful of which you choose. Many less and more expensive sets have some episodes that are almost unwatchable (low sound, blurry picture) and some have earlier silent episodes sprinkled through...and believe me, the silents don't have the same charm as the MGM talkies.....in fact some are just plain awful.

If you are not lucky enough (or rich enough now)to own the Cabin Fever set...THIS is the one to buy. About 75% of the collection disc sets out there are DVD-R sets, not factory pressed discs... this is one such set, but is forgivable because the content is head and shoulders above so many of the rest. These are as good of copies of the original episodes as they get. I have purchased 3 other Little Rascals sets from that auction site for various amounts, but was still looking for a ""GOOD"" set until purchasing this one. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT waste your money on more expensive sets unless it is a Cabin Fever set.....you'll be sorry. Concidering the quality of other sets I have bought, this one has an amazingly low price for the quality.

My ONLY gripe holds true with every other set out there...the episode order...there is none. I would LOVE to find a set that had each short in the order it appeared, but sadly I don't think such a set exists. Episodes flip-flop back and forth through the years like a broken time machine.  If I ever get around to it some day, I'm going to rip, and remaster these discs in correct episode order.",1332374400,17,1537,4.581818181818182

4390593,5,B004J5RMO4,I have only started to watch these wonderful episodes which bring back so many wonderful childhood memories.  They're will never be a anything like this again.  A true collectable!,1329177600,,180,5.172413793103448
4390594,5,B004J5RMO4,I purchased this DVD set after having purchased a VHS version of just one of the episodes.  Much better on DVD. Brought back a lot of good memories.,1325116800,,148,4.285714285714286
4390595,5,B004J5RMO4,"First of all, let me just say that I usually DON't write reviews. My schedule remains hectic and I usually cannot take the time to do so, but with this set I just couldn't but help do so.  Like other reviewers I was a little bit skeptical as I have been burned by other ""home made"" collectors editions of other TV shows.  With the price being less that $30, I didn't mind risking the money, and did my gamble pay off.  This set includes all of the Hal Roach Studios Talking ""Our Gang"" shorts that were distributed by MGM from 1929 - 1938, which were renamed ""The Little Rascals"" for television syndication.  This collection, though, is far better than you will remember them, because they include ALL of the shorts:  restored, unedited, uncut, uncensored, and commercial free!  Many of these shorts were NOT included in the television package:  including (for PC sensitivity issues): Moan and Groan, Inc., The Kid From Borneo, Lazy Days, and Railroadin' (due to the sound disc having been lost for decades and only existing in its silent version)  As a kid I never did see Fly My Kite or Shiver My Timbers and a few others leaving me to assume that these were also not included in the TV package, at least where I grew up.  Other shorts were severely butchered for times sake and sensitivity issues.

Now, let me also say, that I purchased the Cabin Fever VHS as well as the Cabin Fever DVDs of which only 1/2 of the VHS were released to DVD before Cabin Fever went bankrupt.  I thought that I had struck gold getting a brand new set of the Cabin Fever DVDs years after they were out of print.  However, within two years of my purchase, my professionally pressed DVDs became corrupted and are now unplayable!  Not able to find another set, I was going to painstakingly record the VHS to my computer and burn to DVD.  This set has eliminated me from having to do that, and boy am I grateful.

Mysteriously, this set appears to have the same line-up as the Cabin Fever VHS / DVD, leaving me to conclude that these were mastered off of the Cabin Fever set minus the Cabin Fever openings and Leonard Maltin Reviews.  So, If you have been wanting the Cabin Fever set without paying outrageous prices, this set is for you!  I've got to end this now as I am late for the dentist.",1325116800,61,2272,4.449275362318841

am grateful that someone took the time to preserve these shorts and make them available for sale to the public. However, the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because.it was not put on
a professional DVD like you buy in a retail store.
Also, after seeing some one else's review I did realize it dosn't have the MGM music in the beginning. Either they thought it was a waste of time leaving it in each episode or they didn't want to pay for the rights to leave it in. Which is disappointing, but that's ok I still enjoy laughing
through each episode and remembering it from my child hood. So in the words of Bob Hope let me just say, thanks for the memories.",1401667200,,702,4.207407407407407
