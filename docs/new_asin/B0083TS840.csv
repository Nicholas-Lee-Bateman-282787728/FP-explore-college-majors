8524762,5,B0083TS840,"I remembered this film vaguely when I had seen it as a child. I did not remember its title but I knew it was a British military comedy about some sailors who while drunk weld a goofy thingamajig on a military vessel and a comedy of misconception ensues. I did remember that I deeply enjoyed it as a child and had never come across the film again.

While perusing VCIs catalog of British films and reading their descriptions I realized I had come across this obscure film once again.

Usually when seeing a film you have fond memories of as a child you are inevitably dissapointed when seeing it later as an adult. I was happily surprised upon viewing that this film surpassed my childhood memories.

A British comedy in some ways similar to the classic "" The Mouse that Roared""  "" You Know What Sailors Are"" is a big budget technicolor extravaganza exception to the usual black and white budget starved British comedy's of the period.

Three sailors while on leave get drunk and decide to play a prank. They steal the three balled brass sign off a pawn shop and weld it on the radar beacon of a destroyer Britain has just sold to an Arab nation.

The next day a British officer spots the weird contraption on the ship and inquires what it is? This simple question results in the mistaken belief that the thingamajig is a secret death Ray weapon.

The three sailors set out on an outrageous quest to steal their drunken folly of a contraption back before it results in their courtmartial or world war 3.

Highly recommended for those who enjoy classic British comedy! The only thing bad about this film is the god awful title, what were they thinking?",1403740800,,1650,4.531986531986532
