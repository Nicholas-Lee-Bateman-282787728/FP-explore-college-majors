I've got an idea, how about a separate section on the disc for interviews??? - Ya think these discs might actually sell???

I bought this thinking the interviews were separate from the videos and for about 6.00 used, how could anyone go wrong?

In short, if you are looking for the actual, complete, *un-interrupted* videos (or interviews) from these artists, save your money.

AMAZON - PLEASE TAKE GREATER TIME IN MAKING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ""VIDEO COMPILATION"" AND ""VIDEO DOCUMENTARY"" - COULDA SAVED ME A LOT OF MONEY!!!!",1142380800,,716,4.892561983471074
