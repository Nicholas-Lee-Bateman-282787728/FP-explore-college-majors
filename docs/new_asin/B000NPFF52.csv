I purchased this video to learn more about leather working, hence the name of the DVD.  The first 2 hours is of a man tracing a drawing on a piece of leather then using stamps to create the design.  VERY MISLEADING advertiising by the maker.  I don't usually write reviews but I felt compelled to after watching this DVD.  Anyone like me me, who is wanting to learn how to work with leather and using the different tools, should not purchase this video unless you are interested in drawing designs on leather and using stamps to imprint your designs in the leather.  I feel like I just through my money in the garbage.  No fault of Amazon, they shipped it in 2 days, just a horrible DVD for someone wanting to learn about leather working in general.  Video picture quality and sound is good.  If leather stamping is your thing, you may learn something, if not, DO NOT waste your money.",1445385600,2,1025,4.433155080213904

Now, I am determined at my age to give the leather working art a real go. This book has brought back,reminded me of the small stuff and expanded my mind on the subject. A good book to go by. Thank You",1240444800,6,312,3.9682539682539684
