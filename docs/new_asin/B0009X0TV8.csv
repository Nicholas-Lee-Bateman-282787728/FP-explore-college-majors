8068904,3,B0009X0TV8,"I watched this film years ago when it was on television and I taped it to VHS. I really enjoyed this movie and already liked Eric Thals prev. performances and this one was awesome. Elizabeth Hurley isn't the best actress, in anything shes been in although I really liked her in Bedazzled, she played the devil quite well!

Some of the content of the movie isn't purely Biblical, its a bit changed and if you are seeking a pure rendition of the story of Samson and Delilah then you might get your toes stepped on with this one. If your just up for a well made beautiful movie then its def worth buying.

Two thumb up to Eric Thal for giving a great performance as Samson, and looking quite gorgeous while doing so :)
