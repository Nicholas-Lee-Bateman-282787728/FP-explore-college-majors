8155171,5,B000K9JP2A,"If you feel you are not getting the straight poop on the story re/ the camps in WW2, then this is one not to miss! Dr. Toben is the MAN!!!
He uses his razor sharp intellect and analytic research skills to uncover and debunk many of the myths surrounding the German internment camps for various prisoners during the war. Watch with an open mind and become liberated from the guilt mongering death worshipping NWO money pig media monster that would forever have us mourn and worship less than 10% of the dead of WW2!!! After watching this you will be reminded of a line from Monty Python and the Holy Grail... "" are we going to stand around and worry about who killed who, this is supposed to be a festive occasion!"" (I paraphrase).
Let us never again poison another generation of youth with this useless guilt trip re/ a handful of the dead! Stalin made Hitler look like a school girl when it came to mass murder! as did Mao! Check out ""The Soviet Story"" also if you want to know more about this subject, and also ""The Katyn Forrest Massacre"". Evil is a human characteristic and is now being used by the IDF against the Palestinians... I would like to hear more about todays genocides than the old school stuff, and Toben liberates us from any more kvetching about yesterdays dead!",1244246400,16,1280,4.497854077253219
