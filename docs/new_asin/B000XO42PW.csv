Be warned that this isn't quite a straightforward ""workout"" as-you-go dvd: you will probably need to view it once or twice first. That said, it is excellent and has some substance. I also enjoyed the instructor's sense of humor and presence, making the subject less intimidating.",1316563200,7,343,5.142857142857143
3004520,5,B000XO42PW,"I like this dvd.  Very good, clear instructions and good demenstration.
If you want a easy to follow dvd, this may not be. But tai chi is not something easy to follow,  you have to work on it gradually.",1310947200,6,202,4.153846153846154

3004522,4,B000XO42PW,"This DVD was very difficult for me to review. I couldn't rate it poorly simply because it was not for me when it would be great for someone else. I have a Scott Cole Tai Chi DVD which I love. I figured this DVD would be a little more advanced and the next step up. The problem is, I do Tai Chi for relaxation and leisure. The Scott Cole DVD is perfect for that. Nothing really to memorize and you learn instantly. This DVD is for someone that wants very deep indepth training. The moves are complex, but I do have to say, explained very well. If you are looking for a high level Tai Chi training DVD from an experienced instructor, this DVD is for you. If you are looking for an easy, relaxing, press play and start doing a bunch of Tai Chi moves DVD, this dvd is not for you.",1293494400,60,776,4.078431372549019
3004523,5,B000XO42PW,"I have to agree with the rest of the positive reviews here. Being this my first approach to Tai Chi, it looks as if both beginners and advanced could benefit from the clarity, simplicity, and HIGH quality with which this DVD has been produced. The animations showing exactly which part of the body to focus on are a plus+ to avoid mistakes from the beginning. I can't stress this enough: the production and quality of this DVD are excellent. Not only for Tai Chi, but for any instructional DVD I've seen around. As other reviewer stated I was also happily surprised that Mr. Chao Pang takes the instruction very seriously, but the approach is very relaxed and with a gentle sense of humor. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1285113600,18,709,4.68

3004525,5,B000XO42PW,"As a newcomer to the 24 Movement Yang Short Form, I purchased Tai Chi: Stillness Through Motion to reinforce my weekly lessons with Chao Pang in Santa Barbara, California.  I utilize the beginning of the DVD, where Chao performs the entire form through three times, as a way to practice what I know of the form.  Then using the individual lessons, I review the areas where I need more practice.

Tai Chi: Stillness Through Motion has made my Tai Chi practice more enjoyable and efficacious! The video footage is thoroughly presented, and creatively edited and authored so that it satisfies both technical and aesthetic sensibilities.  Chao Pang is a masterful instructor who shares his expertise with joy and humor, and this instructional DVD captures the effortless power of his instruction.",1196380800,33,792,5.069230769230769

Chao shows us the internal source of Tai Chi. ""Out of Wu Ji comes Tai Chi"" More importantly he demonstrates the moves in easy to follow detail and the whole show is beautifully done.

8228807,5,B000XO42PW,"Chao Pang and Amin Wu are two of my favorite tai chi teachers of the Yang 24 tai chi form.  I learned the form from a Paul Lam instructor and a Paul Lam DVD--- it was good way to learn and the DVD provides a good reference (I'm certified by The Paul Lam organization) but I find the tai chi productions dvd often slow and plodding.  Good and useful and well-respected training  but sometimes a very slow behavior modification method.  Teachers Pang and Wu (and maybe David Dorian-Ross)  just appeal to me more.  Can't go wrong with any of these four teachers, and Paul Lam's version may be best for beginners but Pang and Wu are the ones I watch the most now a days.",1522540800,,666,4.288

8228811,5,B000XO42PW,"I find the lessons that Chao Pang teaches to be clear & concise & engaging....It's not easy but challenging & interesting.
He is a terrific teacher & for anyone interested in Tai Chi this is a must!",1402444800,,198,4.378378378378378
8228812,5,B000XO42PW,"I learned tai chi many years ago and forgot the movements through lack of practice. Now at 67 I want to take it up again, but do not have a teacher in the area. I bought this DVD and am impressed with how clearly and carefully Master Pang guided me through the 24 movement form. The 12 individual lessons are easy to follow. I have gone through these lessons many times and enjoy them as stand alone practices. Combining them together happens in the first chapter when Master Pang leads you through the moves of the form. He repeats the form 3 times and your view of him is from his back, so it feels like you are following him in a class. I am very impressed and highly recommend this DVD.",1396483200,2,690,4.234848484848484
8228813,4,B000XO42PW,"but lots of good basic  information for a beginner, but I didn't feel he was very good in explaining the movements.  I was looking for the Yang style that I used to do and this style is confusing and not very exact.",1368921600,,215,4.095238095238095
8228814,3,B000XO42PW,"Love Chao Pang - very nice to watch and listen to.  Very entertaining.
The production is pretty good as well, but not without a few glitches.
The introductory lessons about posture, etc I thought were pretty good. I like the more in-depth teaching on core principles.
Where I struggled as a total novice was when I attempted to start learning the forms.
I don't really like the way the chapters are broken-up.  The forms (or at least parts of them) are taught, and then they have this ""connecting move"" method where they try to teach moves to go from one form to another.  This was really confusing to me.
The other major issue I had was the lack of multiple camera angles.  I may be spatially challenged, but it was hard for me to follow because of the lack of rear camera angles.
Also - this is not a step-by-step type of DVD.  There's no ""left foot here, right hand here"" type of stuff.
I benefited from some of the preliminary lessons but for me, I was frustrated to the point of giving up on actually learning the forms.",1342137600,8,1025,4.402116402116402
8228815,4,B000XO42PW,"It is unfair of me to review this video at this time, but will give a pre-review.  Due to time constraints, I have only viewed the extra material, and have been occasionnally working on form one.  I like Master Pangs presentation and description, simple and clear.  His explanation of standing, the spine, and other aspects of the body when practicing Tai Chi is excellent.  Tai Chi is probably best learned with a live instructor and group, but again, time constraints have placed me into the video realm, which I am not unhappy about.  I have viewed and currently use Gi Gong for Beginners with Master Chris Pei, which I like very much.  I have also attempted Master Peis' video on Tai Chi.  Tai Chi, apparently, takes approx. a year to learn the forms (with regular pratices) and a life time to perfect.  I have given this dvd a 4 star rating only because I haven't fully delved into it, but through viewing what I have so far, I can see a 5 star rating in the future with practice and discipline.",1335571200,2,1000,4.486187845303867
8228816,5,B000XO42PW,"I use the word ""plus"" in my title because unlike so many other Tai Chi Chuan DVD's, Master Pang's does not simply provide the movements of the form, which, by the way, are presented very, very well and in a format that anyone can understand and adapt to. Of the many DVD's I have covering the art as presented by various masters, this is far and away my very favorite. Master Pang goes into a little of the history and lineage of tai chi, the philosophical influences behind the art, his own background, and a great deal of fine points that one would usually only pick up from one's own teacher. I enjoy watching this DVD time and again as I continue to learn new things from it, and simply really enjoying watching this mater at work. My recommendation couldn't be higher. If you were going to buy just 1 DVD about Tai Chi, this is the one I would recommend the highest.",1318464000,9,871,4.3496932515337425
