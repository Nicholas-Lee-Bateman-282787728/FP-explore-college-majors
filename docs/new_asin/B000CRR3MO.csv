8101347,5,B000CRR3MO,"So our two year old daughter doesn't watch tv (we live in the country and only get three channels, none of which have cartoons) so the only things she has watched are Mommy and Me and Baby Einstein videos.  Until my MIL bought her a Clifford video, well we first watched it about two months ago and she loved it.  So I broke down and bought her this one and I must say it's become her new favorite.  We try to limit her watching any tv to every other day, but she still asks every day to watch her Clifford movie.  My husband rented the actual Clifford Movie that came out a few years ago and she was not as interested in that as she is in this video.  Not sure if it's cause she is used to puppy Clifford as apposed to the grown up Clifford, but she does love these Clifford shows. It's nice cause there are a ton of small shows on this, much better to keep a two year olds attention.  I would def. give this 5 stars.  :)",1294876800,,922,4.005464480874317

This show, in addition to the regular big Clifford show, are fabulous shows for kids. Each show has a moral lesson.... both big and small. Plus it is so cute!!",1142640000,4,274,4.392156862745098
