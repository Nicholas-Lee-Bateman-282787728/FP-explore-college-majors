6308853,3,B00J22YTJU,The discs would work fine in any player in any region. If you live in the US and want the digital copy (the primary reason I wanted to purchase this item) you're out of luck. This version is manufactured for sale in the UK and Ireland so your digital copy code will not be valid in the US.,1451865600,7,289,4.0
6308854,2,B00J22YTJU,"Disappointed for this holiday already, all my purchases from Amazon (U.S.) & Amazon (Ca) Canada have left a sour taste. Redemption codes won't work left & right, should've checked to make sure it was from the U.S., wrong of me to assume Amazon U.S. meant it could come from the U.K. (300 Collection); wrong of me to assume. My Canadian bought blu-rays (3) redemption codea won't work either. Damn Amazon. Ca, at least I've finished my 300 Collection. Still sad this holiday.",1450137600,,474,4.7926829268292686

6308863,5,B00J22YTJU,"2 great movies for cheap. buy them.

300 is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. it's based on the true story of the battle of Thermopylae. if you haven't seen this movie, you need to. great action flick with lots of violence - sometimes I watch it to get pumped up before going to the gym. it's inspiring and motivational to see how the heroes of Sparta actually stood up for Greek freedom and fought back against the tyranny of the Persians.

the other movie is supposed to a prequel/sequel (it's confusing). it's not as good as 300, but it's entertaining.",1460505600,,564,4.466019417475728

8647311,5,B00J22YTJU,great action flick. now everybody is imatating the slo-mo techniques of this movie. lots of blood slinging and slaughter. not for the faint of horror and death. if you like violent death and lot of blood this is the movie for you.,1526688000,,230,4.5
8647312,4,B00J22YTJU,Giving it a 4 because it seemed very nice quality and everything. Although it does NOT work in the US. Do not buy it if you live here.,1525219200,,134,3.8214285714285716
8647313,1,B00J22YTJU,"Definitely not ""Region Free"".  Blu rays do not play in my blu ray player, and no access to the digital copy either.  I'm frustrated because I only ordered the item because it said ""Region Free"", and that was not the case.",1500940800,3,221,4.365853658536586

8647317,1,B00J22YTJU,"I watch a lot of movies on my PS4. Both of these movies definitely was not made for market sale in the USA. Every time I switch between watching a movie with a US region code and these 300 movies with obvious European region codes. And that's not mitchening I can only change the code 2 more times on my PS4
