8717500,3,B00Y3MP2B8,"This Blu-Ray DVD features Ekaterina Semenchuk as Carmen, Carlo Ventre as Don Jose, Carlos Alvarez as Escamillo, and the delightful Irina Lungu as Micaela.  The performance itself occurs in the Arena Di Verona, and is conducted by Henrik Nanasi, stage direction by Franco Zeffirelli.  This is a team that should be hitting on all cylinders, yet something is missing.

Having seen more than a few productions of Carmen over my lifetime, I must admit that for me to be truly satisfied with a production of this opera, the singer in the Carmen role must exude a smoldering captivating sexiness coupled with a sense of longing vulnerability  and that just doesnt happen here.  I must similarly be totally and completely convinced that Don Jose simply cant help himself, throwing away his life with Micaela because he is totally enraptured and enthralled by Carmen, her sexiness and sensitive side seducing him totally and without any chance of resistance.  And that didn't happen for me here either.

That being said, Irina Lungus portrayal of Micaela is stunning, and you can feel her desire for Don Jose, her fervent wish that he would choose to abandon the dark path he is going down.  It goes without saying that her vocal work is spectacular and heart wrenching, and that her Micaela is sensitive and adorable.  It is clear that Don Jose is truly lost because he turns away from her to go back to the life that he is terribly unhappy with, and a woman who will not allow herself to be loved in the way that she telegraphs to others.

The liner notes give only the plot summary.  However, the sound quality is excellent, and the orchestra plays *wonderfully*.  The sets themselves (given the Arena framework in which they are placed) are appealing, although not particularly extravagant.  So the bottom line, for me, is that I have truly mixed feelings about this production.  I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it either.  Im afraid that this production is strictly average.",1471478400,,1975,4.818991097922849
8717501,2,B00Y3MP2B8,"Carmen is not one of my 100 favorite operas. I know it is a masterpiece but I do not like the character of Carmen. I may not like the opera because it is too common and everybody loves it. The same thing happens to me with Gilda, whom I hate for sacrifying his father for a rascal whom she knows has nothing to do with her, except sex. I bought this DVD because of Zeffirelli only and I was disappointed. Perhaps the Arena di Verona is not the best place for his magnificent productions. None of the singers except Micaela, impressed me either.",1443398400,,544,4.29126213592233
8717502,4,B00Y3MP2B8,"Among the many spirited productions of ""Carmen,"" it is hard to see why this one was made at all.  To be sure, the sets and costumes are flashy and colorful and the setting, in the outdoor Arena di Verona, is exciting (and presents many of the problems to be encountered in such a space, chiefly with sound).  The dancers are flirtatious and offer more spirited performances than one often sees.  Even the children's chorus handles the changing of the guard with aplomb.  The problem is that the singers and chorus are seldom together and are frankly out of tune more than one would like to believe.  Ekaterina Semenchuk at her best has a lovely and resonant voice with seductive undertones but her hair looks like she underwent a bad dye job and she is more fleshy and ordinary-looking than a seductress who commands men's attention. Given her girth, she is less a moving presence than someone who appears to prefer sitting and looking a little morose.  She seems older and does not appear credible as a passionate, headstrong young woman who refuses to play by the rules.  The problems of fleshiness and age also afflict Carlo Ventre as Don Jose and Carlos Alvarez as Escamillo.  Based on these singers' performances, I got the impression I was watching a decidedly low-budget version of Carmen.  The leads sing tolerably well for the most part but no one brought a stellar voice to the performance.  Tempi were distractingly uneven: sometimes the conductor seemed to be trying to catch up after the singing lagged - and especially in the first act it must never lag.  The best performance was Irina Lungu's as Micaela.  Ms. Lungu has a sweet, accurate voice with appealingly dark colorations; she obviously has potential.  I have also seen her in the Tutto Verdi production of ""Il Corsaro."" She was vulnerable and attractive; there was a poignant quality to her performance.  In this opera, however, it seemed that her voice did not hold up well when she had to sing loudly. Whether that is a problem with her or the sound reproduction I could not tell.

After watching this video I turned on the Met's version with Roberto Alagna and Elina Garanca.  Ms. Garanca has a commanding stage presence and she simply smokes, sizzles and smoulders.  She is never still.  Mr. Alagna is passable and sings well, especially in French, but he is not really cut out for Don Jose.  The performance was paced exactly right, everyone was on cue, and the singers were together and in tune. It was thrilling to watch.  Of course the Met chorus and orchestra are as fine as anywhere on Earth.  And from the first notes of the overture, the music was dazzlingly executed under the baton of Yannick Nezet-Seguin.  The Met's set was well-designed and yet after seeing the Arena di Verona, it seemed claustrophobic. Doubtless, this problem inheres in performing an opera indoors in Manhattan instead of outdoors in the Veronese evening. Likewise, the Met production offered less colorful costumes and flash among the dancers.  The Met manages the on-stage business among all performers with more sophistication, however, and one expects that.

On the whole, while I found the Veronese ""Carmen"" interesting, I cannot recommend it.  It's hard to get swept away by an opera when you spend so much time worrying about whether the current scene will be brought off properly.",1442275200,2,3348,4.84182776801406
