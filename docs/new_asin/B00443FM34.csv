All the women we've shown this DVD to, have absolutely loved it. I'm so glad it was available separately. The other episodes are good but not something I'd watch again. (The quote, btw, is an old gung fu saying: one of my martial arts teachers told me that, long ago.)",1384041600,,406,4.217948717948718
8415643,5,B00443FM34,"This is the true story of a peasant uprising against the corrupt chin dynasty of china circa 1790 ad. the true story is terrible as the weak emporer and his cronies ravage china and enslave it's people. The country became for the first time way overpopulated too. SO misery was the lot of people and true suffering was overwelming. A truly dark time in the history of china by any standards. wang shi leads a rebel army against the chins and she is very successful at it. and she is only 22. a master of martial arts , she was also a great general and I won't spoil the ending for you here. Lucy Lawless of xena fame , does another fine narration from this series. There are several other volumes all under the warrior women banner. All of them are widescreen and all of them are in color with actors protraying the characters. This one is the bloodiest perhaps of the series but it's after all history and human history is often a bloodbath. Check this series out! It's from the 00's decade.",1346716800,,992,4.396739130434782
