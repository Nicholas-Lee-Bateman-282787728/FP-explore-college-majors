5078790,5,B007CU8P0I,This CD provided and excellent report on the events and lives of the Tuskegge Air Men. I learned a lot about many of them for example the roll Pittsburgh played in the lives of African American Aviators.,1356566400,,203,4.513513513513513
5078791,5,B007CU8P0I,Great documentary if you want the real and true story of the Tusskegee Airmen.  All original footage. Every home library should have it.,1353801600,,136,4.913043478260869
5078792,5,B007CU8P0I,"I thought this would be more of a movie, but it was a great documentary.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Tails-The-Real-Story-Of-The-Tuskegee-Airmen/dp/B007CU8P0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Tails: The Real Story Of The Tuskegee Airmen</a>",1345766400,8,283,9.923076923076923
5078793,4,B007CU8P0I,"I enjoyed the PBS documentary on the Red Tails and found it to be informative on the victories, trials and tribulations of the Tuskegee airmen during WW2. Through personal narratives and archived footage of the 99th fighter squadron in action, it transported me to wartime battle, the era of segregation stateside, and to the obstacles faced by people of color during that time.

My take is that this is a tale of American perseverance and a lesson for everyone (regardless of race, creed or other differences) to keep striving for what you want and believe in.  After all, this is America, the land of opportunity for all who are willing to give it their all.
This film is worth viewing.",1339545600,17,688,4.725
5078794,4,B007CU8P0I,"PBS does a great job is providing an unbiased documentary of the group of brave flyers.  Hollywood does a great job of entertaining, PBS did a great job of educating.",1334793600,13,166,4.533333333333333
5078795,1,B007CU8P0I,"Your ad does not disclose the fact that this is not a movie.
Rather it is a PBS documentary of poor quality and hidden agenda.
Too bad PBS does not want to compete with the real world by disclosing
what it is peddling.",1334016000,4,218,4.093023255813954

5078808,5,B007CU8P0I,This is a very good DVD. It is a history told by the actual men. And it is good to know what they went through because the history books will not tell you. This is worth getting.,1395446400,,178,3.8378378378378377
5078809,1,B007CU8P0I,"There were only narratives and testimonials.. There was little else. It was boring.

  The movies, ""The Tuskeegee Airmen"" and ""Red Tails"" told better stories.  However, even they only scratched the surface of the real experiences of those gallant men, especially the racism and hatred that many of them faced from  ignorant white men who resented them.

  After the war, no airline would hire them as pilots even with their outstanding records and qualifications.

  Unknown to many people is the fact that one of them, Daniel (Chappie) James, flew in Vietnam, made 4-Star General and became the Commander-in-Chief of NORAD.

 Documentary movie makers might do well by putting his story on the screen as well as a biography of General Benjamin O. Davis who was the commanding officer of the ""Red Tails""  .",1393113600,8,805,5.0

8514692,1,B007CU8P0I,"Grossly inaccurate and politically correct ""affirmative action"" driven. The 332nd had the worst combat record of any group during WWII.
Their kill to loss ratio was the worst. Their combat victories per mission was the lowest. Yet their on station deployment was among the highest. To top off these abysmal statistics, the actual size of the 332nd that generated these ""group"" statistics was 33% LARGER than every other European and Mediterranean theater fighter group, comprising FOUR squadrons to every other group's THREE squadrons. Where other American 8th, 9th and 15th Air Force groups produced as many as 30 or 40 Aces or more (5 enemy aircraft shot down), the 332nd Red Tails couldn't even produce 1 (one) Ace.",1459987200,,718,5.093220338983051
