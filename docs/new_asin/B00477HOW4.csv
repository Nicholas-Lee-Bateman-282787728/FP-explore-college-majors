8417808,3,B00477HOW4,I love this movie.  Of course its not even close to be one of Stallone's best movies but it does it for me.  Great suspense and great acting by the whole cast.  For me this movie is a 3/5.,1326499200,,188,3.769230769230769
8417809,1,B00477HOW4,This film is not one of Stallone's best.  It was made by Universal but they abandoned the product when it came time to distribute it in the US.  It was shopped around and released independantly with a changed named from D-Tox to Eye See You.  They may have even altered the aspect ratio.  The D-Tox import version was said to have the original 2:35 ratio.  Unfortunately the item I recieved did not play at all and was returned.  It was listed as region A-Blu-ray but I do not believe it was.  All I got was the message NO DISC on the LCD screen.,1311033600,2,546,4.242718446601942
