Thankfully...he's alive and VERY well!! :-)",1530835200,,215,5.323529411764706

8644515,5,B00IPL2AGI,"The re-emergence of Camel after guitarist/leader Andrew Latimer's death-defying recovery from illness is nothing less than a miracle. But the fact that he is back on stage fronting his excellent band and playing so superbly is a rare reminder of the resilience of the human body and spirit.
In From The Cold may have a deeper personal meaning to Mr. Latimer (and wife/muse/lyricist Susan Hoover), but what we get with Part One of this DVD is a flashback to The Snow Goose in its more recently rearranged form. And it is stunningly good. Though I miss the lighter, more floating sound and style of drummer Andy Ward (the band hits a bit harder these days, though that is no criticism) this music still sails seamlessly from segment to segment, from Latimer's quiet flute passages to his ripping guitar riffing and soaring solos. If you know the material, be ready to welcome it again as fresh and new. The Part Two is a variety of tunes including an acoustic 'Never Let Go' and jaunty 'Fox Hill'...all up to Camel's high standards. It is no wonder Roger Waters want Latimer for his band. But it does remain a wonder that Camel and Latimer have never been Tier One names like Yes and Genesis or Clapton and Beck. Those who are missing out don't know what they're missing...",1431043200,6,1271,4.653333333333333
