6120917,5,B00GWWADDY,"Previous Yugioh releases from 4K Media and Cinedigm display in 16:9, it fits a widescreen TV perfectly But with this season UNFORTUNATELY, it's 4:3 (black bars appear on the left and right sides of your WIDESCREEN TV) why they did it I don't know, but i'm not happy about it smh!!! It can be fixed in the display settings of your DVD/Blu-Ray Player, the characters look a bit stretched, not much and there may be small parts of scenes cut out, but still... Anyway thought i'd let you all know. Besides that, best season in my opinion. Sad it had to be MY FAVORITE SEASON they mess up like this on ): UPDATE: GARY, AND ANYONE ELSE WONDERING, the menu fits the whole screen. It's when you play the episodes, that the black bars appear on the left and right sides of your screen. Making the aspect ratio of the actual show display in 4:3.",1395792000,,835,4.393548387096774
6120918,1,B00GWWADDY,I have been desperately waiting for this item for about 4 months. When it finally arrives the packaging is still good. The bottom part of the dvd is crushed in some way. Will never buy from you guys again sorry.,1395705600,,211,4.3
6120919,5,B00GWWADDY,FINALLY! THE BEST YUGIOH SEASON OF ALL... IT TOOK THEM LONG ENOUGH. THIS IS THE REASONABLE PRICE I WAS WAITING FOR.,1394841600,7,115,4.523809523809524
6120920,4,B00GWWADDY,"Is Dan Green not the voice of Yugi anymore? Also, it says the language is Japanese. Is it really or is it English?",1393977600,,114,4.0
6120921,5,B00GWWADDY,Im excited we finally get season 4 even if it is still the 4 kids edited footage with an attempt at redubbing over that it still doesnt really fit well but thats not my one problem. My one problem with this is it is 2014 people put this on bluray for the love of god seriously you wanna ruin this by making it a dvd format why not just rerelease the whole series on bluray like it deserves that is all,1389830400,2,401,3.962962962962963
6120922,3,B00GWWADDY,I see these set at Wall Mart and I really don't want them because I don't know what they really are! do these contain both the English Dub and Japanese Dub?,1388793600,2,156,4.064516129032258
6120923,5,B00GWWADDY,Finally me and all the fans of the series can own the whole 4th season of the Original Yu-Gi_oh! series and get one step closer to owning the whole series. Season 4 for me was great even though I didn't get a chance to see the whole season but now I can and I hope after season 5 Yu-Gi-Oh! GX will be released.,1388707200,6,310,3.9365079365079363
6120924,5,B00GWWADDY,"Pre released expectations:: Now, I'm expecting this set to be mostly similar to the past 3 other season sets, but different aesthetics. It'll have a slip cover, with Dark Magician Girl on it, with 2 volumes containing 3 discs each in them, each. Each volumes containing relatively 24-25 episodes each. I'll review it more in-depth when I get it next year, but I'm looking forward to it. Cinedigm & 4K Media are really hitting it on the head, with Thor's hammer for releasing these sets now, at such affordable prices & good packaging. Too bad it's not a better dub, with the Japanese language track & subtitles for it, but it's hitting the nostalgia factor really hard, as I mentioned already. Their capitalizing on the nostalgia factor for fans of the original dub & I commend them for it, but let's admit it, it could be a WHOLE LOT better, in hindsight. Whatever you think, I'm still getting this set when it comes out.

Post release thoughts: It's DEFINITELY a good release of this version of the show here in America. It's the 1st release of the whole season here in the US. It was only released by FUNi & 4Kids in 3 volumes, with a 4th only being released in Canada, so this is a great way to get the series. The animation is really well produced. It's not HD, or widescreen, as it was produced before the HD switchover for TV shows, but it's up there with Fullmetal Alchemist (1st series) level animation quality, minus the 1 gun edit to a water pistol 4Kids made due to the standards & practices, but everything else looks pretty well produced. It's another filler arc, like the 1st half of season 3, but it's still pretty good. The Seal of Oricalcose arc, to be precise. Also, since Cinedigm hasn't released volume 2 on iTunes yet, for whatever reason, this is currently the only way to watch the whole season, minus maybe some streaming sites online.
Now, this release does NOT have the Japanese dialogue, as it's the edited version, but it's still the old show you probably have nostalgia for. Can't wait for season 5, Bonds Beyond Time, & hopefully GX & 5Ds. They haven't made them available for preorder yet, despite an announcement that Cinedigm has signed a deal allowing them to distribute the other series' on DVD & iTunes. Though, they may be waiting on a possible continuation of the dubs for those 2 series by 4K Media, before starting to release them, as those 2 are not currently finished being dubbed because of reasons & I hope that's what they're doing for this future release they've announced. I'm surprised that they haven't made them available, as they've been releasing this series in about 2-month intervals since last year & they've had several of the seasons of this series available for preorder for MONTHS before they were released.
Anyways, this is a good release & I'm content with it.",1386374400,3,2822,4.644
6120925,5,B00GWWADDY,"I bought it with the seller of Amazon. Like promised, it did arrived right before 8pm last Sunday. I just started watching the first disc, and it does work. However, I was hoping that I could watch it in Japanese also, but I guess not. I'm happy to be able to get this cause cause I've been wanting to get the complete season since watching the episodes back in high school.

It would have been nice if it was on bluray also, but I am sure that it would be more expensive than the dvd. And yes, I am in my late 20's and a female.",1462233600,,529,3.990566037735849

This was great DVD to collect. The only bad thing is that Yugioh only had five seasons, I wish it stayed more longer.",1410307200,,277,4.346153846153846

6120963,4,B00GWWADDY,"The fourth season of Yu-gi-oh is an interesting little detour from the main plot of the series. Fans either love it or hate it, because the plot and characters seem to be extended far beyond the source content. However,  I found the Atlantis/Legendary Dragons twist to be refreshing after the extended tournament arc that was Battle City (which I also enjoyed).  The introduction of the Seal of Orichalcos may have seemed like an overpowered plot device, but I thought it added a nice twist to the show and its gameplay.  I also appreciated the fact that side characters like Mai, Weevil, and Rex actually got another chance to duel in the series.

Overall, while not a perfect season by any means, season 4 is definitely worth a look for those who haven't seen it.",1399334400,,765,4.686567164179104
6120964,5,B00GWWADDY,"New villians, intense duels and rivalries, new powers and twists and turns at every corner this arc has it all, I definitely would recommend this to anyone who's a fan of the first yugioh series, you will definitely enjoy this one.",1399161600,,231,4.658536585365853

6120966,3,B00GWWADDY,These season sets are a great part of any yugioh fans collection. I always thought season 4 was the worst as there were no real rules in this seaon. At least season one was consistant with its made up rules but this one just took battle cities rules and threw them out the door. The set is good though not subtitles or directory for referrence though.,1398470400,,351,4.333333333333333

6120969,5,B00GWWADDY,I had been getting Yu-Gi-Oh! on DVD years before and was disappointed that this entire season was not released. I'm glad to have the entire season on one set now. This was probably the season I liked the best. Can't wait for season 5!,1397260800,,234,4.340909090909091

6120971,5,B00GWWADDY,"I hadn't seen any episodes from season 4 since they first aired when I was a kid, and I didn't remember too well what happened. But after the first few episodes, I was hooked. Watched 3 discs in a row while I was supposed to be studying. Jokes get better in this season, duels are full of tension, and the new characters introduced are pretty well rounded. Also, I got a darker vibe from this season than previous ones (4kids really toned down season 3) which made it feel closer to the Japanese version. I just don't like the new voice actress who does Mai, but so far that's my only complaint about this season. As far as the actual dvds go, they are only the English 4kids version with the 39 episodes split up between 6 discs. On my TV, they automatically stretch so they look HD.",1396483200,,784,4.304054054054054
6120972,5,B00GWWADDY,"I was reading reviews where someone had stated that the screen had black lines on the side as it was in 4:3 and not 6:9 ratio, but I didn't think it was too big of a deal, however when I got it, it fit my screen in 6:9 ratio perfectly, there was no black lines and I found the picture to be very clear. I'm not sure if this has anything to do with the fact that I'm in Australia but I thought it might be helpful to state that it fit my screen perfectly.

It came the day I expected it to and it was perfectly packaged. There was no damage to the box or cases which I'm really thankful. Also, people have been asking whether Dan Green still does Yugi/Yami as he is not listed in the actors, yes it is still definitely Dan Green for anyone who was wondering.

I absolutely love this series and can't wait for the next, so I will finally own all of the original Yu-Gi-Oh series. I definitely recommend buying from Amazon.",1396137600,9,919,4.1
