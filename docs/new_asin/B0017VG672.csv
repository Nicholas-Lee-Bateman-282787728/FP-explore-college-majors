3176118,5,B0017VG672,We have a few of these variety Nick Jr. Dvds.  They are great.  I love that when it is over it does not just stop at a menu and then I have to stop what I am doing and get the dvd going again.  It just continues to play and she loves all of these dvds.  She started to like these shows at age 3.  She had no interested in them until about 2.5.  If you child is younger then 2.5 they may not be interested but one day all of a sudden they will love all of these Nick Jr shows.,1365120000,,475,3.607843137254902
3176119,5,B0017VG672,"This Dvd includes Dora, Diego, Blues Clues, Jack's Clubhouse, Yo Gabba Gabba, and the Wonder Pets. My 2year old daughter loves them all! I love the Nick Jr Collection DVDs and have purchased a bunch and haven't been let down yet!",1361664000,,229,4.609756097560975
3176120,5,B0017VG672,This is a great Dvd! I presently do not have cable and it satisfied my son's need to have something in place of his beloved Nick Jr which he watches at his gradnparent's house. It has all his favorites and he's entertained! I love it,1354838400,,233,4.2
3176121,5,B0017VG672,I only bought this DVD because it had the Soccer episode from Blue's Clues.  We had that particular episode saved on our DVR and it accidentally got erased.  Our son LOVED that episode.  This was erased about 8 months ago and it STILL has not re-aired on Nick Jr!  I was so happy to discover this DVD.  We have watched it non-stop almost since it arrived.,1337299200,,355,4.318181818181818
3176122,4,B0017VG672,"Although it's a stretcher to say this is ""all about fall,"" I liked this DVD very much. It was an intro to Jack's Big Music Show, which I love, and Wonder Pets, both new to me--I probably would not have given either of them a chance without this sampler DVD.

The surreal, freaky Yo Gabba Gabba always satisfies me and my child--and it's the only real ""fall"" one, and it is a very good intro to Halloween.  The Wonder Pets is about starting preschool; o, that is sort of about fall.

The Blues Clues is Joe playing soccer. Around here, soccer is spring, summer, AND fall, but, OK. One note on the soccer episode. The incredibly handsome Joe seems to have gone too quickly through the costume department. His sweat pants are, uhm, snug, and there seems to be nothing beneath them. Whether this is an advantage or a disadvantage depends on you. As for me, if I have to watch slow paced kids' shows for part of my day, I'm pretty glad to have a cute guy to look at while my child looks for clues.",1322524800,4,992,4.294117647058823
3176123,3,B0017VG672,"This DVD is fine.. I just don't get why they chose to title it ""All About Fall"". The only episode that really has anything to do with Fall is Yo Gabba Gabba Halloween.. that's it. The Blue's Clues episode is about playing soccer and eating ice cream. Mmmk. Pretty deceptive and disappointing. Luckily I previewed it by ordering it from Netflix. I would not purchase this DVD.",1256601600,3,375,4.611940298507463
3176124,3,B0017VG672,"I don't really know how many stars to give this. It's not terrible by any means, but it wasn't what I expected. What is so strange to me about this DVD as a whole is that there are fall leaves all over the cover, it is actually entitled ALL About FALL, and there is nothing particularly ""fall-ish"" about it at all. There are several episodes having to do with school, so I suppose the thinking is that going back to school is an early fall event. Anyway, if you are looking for fall colors on the trees, apples, pumpkins, or episodes about the change in weather, etc. this is not it. The Yo Gabba Gabba episode is the only true fall episode, a Halloween episode. We had never seen this show before, and wow, it is ""different."" My husband and I have been laughing out loud. We first noted that it is a little annoying (the puppets sing off key and the songs are very repetitive) and just kind of bizarre (he compares it to a Japanese game show or an SNL parody of a kids' show) but that actually makes it pretty funny- but then, we're not the intended audience! Anyway, there are plenty of Halloween DVDs out there (this Yo Gabba Gabba episode is also available on a Yo Gabba Gabba DVD entitled Halloween), I was just hoping this DVD was about the entire fall season- hoping because of the implication of the title, which I think is a poor title for these episodes. My kids liked this DVD just fine, but since we do not have cable, they are just glad to get to see anything on TV.  I always appreciate it when someone lists the episodes with a brief description, so here they are. I used the jacket description for shows I have never seen before because I am not used to these shows' typical formats. I hope the list will be helpful and you can decide for yourself:

Dora- ""School Pet""- The class hamster is missing. Dora and Boots set out to find her and bring her home.

Blue's Clue's- ""Soccer Practice""- This is an episode with Joe (as most are) all about playing soccer, Blue's clues end up being and ice cream truck (hope this doesn't spoil it for you!)

Wonder Pets- ""Off to School"" and ""Save the Pirate Parrot""- A baby blowfish needs help feeling brave about her first day of preschool. The pirate parrot needs help finding her pirate.

Jack's Big Music Show- ""Mel's Super Swell Dance Party""- DVD jacket description ""Gather 'round and get ready to say 'yippee!' and dance any way the music moves you at Mel's once-a-year party. With Laurie Berkner, Yolanda Adams, the Dirty Sock Funtime Band, and more!""  I am not sure if this show usually has any sort of plot, but this episode was exactly like the title indicates, a dance party- no story line, lots of singing and dancing.

Yo Gabba Gabba!- ""Halloween""- DVD jacket description ""Sing, dance, and celebrate Halloween as DJ Lance Rock and the gang dress up in costumes, trick-or-treat, and move and groove to Halloween tunes!"" The first song is about leaves falling, then everyone dresses up and sings about Halloween, then everyone goes trick-or-treating and sings about that, then everyone gets sick on candy and sings about that. Hilarious!

Blue's Room- ""Alphabet Power""- DVD jacket description ""All 26 letters have come to Blue's Room for a play date! Gain awesome Alphabet Power as you play 'pell it/pretend it' draw letters, read a story (Chicka Chicka Boom Boom) , and more!""",1255651200,29,3339,4.553333333333334
