8572272,5,B00BPFPMSO,"Yes, indeedy, I loved this movie when I, at the tender age of ten, first saw it at the Village Theater in Annapolis, Maryland. Okay, I viewed it with my  mom, who thought Dennis Morgan was terrific (didn't tell dad, of course). And , through the ingenuous eyes of innocent youth, I thought Janis Paige was out of this world performing her strutting bar-room table rendition of a prototypical Western ballad, ""Going Back to Old Cheyenne"".
Later in life, from a TV. showing of this classic, I  picked up that song again during my senior year at Coral Gables Sr. High, Florida.as one of my first attempts at singing and playing on my new  Sears Silvertone acoustic guitar. I then coerced my youthful buddy Steve Sheridan, who really was gifted on guitar and voice, to jointly perform this chestnut for his mom, the sibling of the 40's ""oomph"" actress, Ann Sheridan. (Boy, the irony of that sisterhood ...one can only imagine how well Ms. Sheridan could have put that number over the top as a singer/dancer in her own right.) Kindly, Stevie's mother proffered lavish kudos on us, as a mother would won't to do.
Anyhow, to the chase...Janis' number itself is well worth the investment in this Western gem. (Certainly, right up there with Gregory Peck's brief vocal rendition of ""Got To Find Me Somebody To Love"" from ""Duel In The Sun"" [1946]). Need I suggest, they don't come any better as a nostalgic Western filmic offering.",1440028800,,1421,4.721774193548387

Very clean b/w print.",1418601600,2,177,4.46875

8572276,5,B00BPFPMSO,"Great movie, Dennis Morgan never received the acclaim he deserved. Jane Wyman and another under appreciated performer Janice Paige were great.",1406851200,,142,5.809523809523809

8572278,4,B00BPFPMSO,"This is a great DVD print of a terrific western of the late 1940's. Jane Wyman, always excellent, in a different kind of role - bad girl/good girl. Dennis Morgan is very pleasing and Janis Paige perks up all her scenes. All in all, I would say, if you like westerns, then buy this one. Different and unusual and fun to watch.",1370217600,7,325,4.258064516129032
8572279,5,B00BPFPMSO,"""Cheyenne"" (not to be confused with the television program of a decade later) is a fine major Western released by Warner Bros. in 1947. Directed slylishly by accomlished director Raoul Walsh, it stars Dennis Morgan, Jane Wyman, Alan Hale (Sr.), Arthur Kennedy, and Bruce Bennett. Warner Archive's release gives us a very good quality copy, in sharp black and white. Recommended.",1368144000,4,378,5.213114754098361
