467992,5,6302462142,"You gotta have a VHS player to see this one. Originally released in '91, this movie is one of the best drama, horror, comedy, action, romance movies of all time. If you can find one, buy it. It's loaded with cameo appearances from actors and comedians, young and old. I rate it higher than ""Rocky Horror"". The acting, casting and special effects are as good as any you will find anywhere.",1283472000,,388,4.47887323943662

There are so many little inside jokes, you have to watch this movie many times over. Add in cameos by Ben and Jerry Stiller and Gilbert Gottfried as a neurotic Hitler, and you have pure movie gold!",1232841600,12,351,4.253731343283582

467995,3,6302462142,"Not up to the standard of Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" trilogy. Some funny moments, one great death, amusing cameos. This is basically a comedy/horror retelling of the Orpheus and Eurydice myth, right down to the three-headed hound at the gates of Hades, the Styx and the instruction to not look back. Disappointing ending. Like its scenery, the movie seems a little dry and barren. Some good effects though. Some not so good.",1060387200,3,421,4.861111111111111
467996,5,6302462142,"I'll admit that the tone of this film was somewhat campy but that is exactly it's charm. I also found the visual effects and the cast in this movie to be more than able to pull it off. Scenes such as the convoy of VW Bugs passing Charlie Sykes (Chad Lowe) in his '48 Roadster, the Ronnie Reagan Iran Contra theme for that roadside bar Charlie Sykes stopped in on his way to Hell City and the road crew of Andy Worhols working for the Good Intentions Paving Co. all against the backdrop of the Nevada desert were pretty cool.

Anyway.. don't expect much from this film.. but you'll probably still enjoy it.
By the way... Hellcop kinda reminded me of Scarman from the movie ""Cut"" (I don't know why I'm telling you this).",976924800,5,411,4.722222222222222

468076,5,6302462142,"I once encountered a man in a convenience store that really concerned me at the time.
It was the middle of the summer, I was only there to buy a cold drink, but when an elderly man with green hair and all yellow clothes, from his pants and the shirt on his back right down to the shoes and socks on his feet,ALL YELLOW suddenly fixed me with a facial expression wild enough to make Kathy bates in the movie ""Misery"" look sane in comparison I backed off a few feet before he spoke.

""I haven't ate in weeks, Mister. Could you spare a few bucks so I could buy a bag of chips and an energy drink???"" he exclaimed.
 The curious thing though was the fact that he wasn't holding any food items in his hands.
He was holding a pack of 9 volt batteries.
 I didn't ask.

I reached into my pocket and produced a solid $4.43 and handed it over to him, hoping the Big Bird style nature of his clothing wouldn't reflect banana-tinged hues into my eyes for decades to come. He didn't thank me. I turned to pay for my drink and heard him walking back toward the drink cooler.

As I was paying for my drink I instinctively turned to find him stomping back toward the checkout line but this time he had 2 packs of triple a batteries and an ice scraper - which seemed odd to me since it was summer and the only car outside the store was my own.
I finished paying for my drink and headed for the door but stopped just short of the exit to see what would transpire.

The 77 year old man approached the counter, looking around in a decidedly nervous manner. The female cashier rang up his batteries and ice scraper.
""That will be $11.44"" she said.
""But I don't have $11.44, I only have $4.43."" said the old man in an aggressive manner.
The cashier shot him a look, as if to say ""Don't make me call the police"".
I turned and left the store. I continued walking to my car and climbed into it.

As I was putting my keys in the ignition I looked back toward the store. The 77 year old man with the punk rock hair and the yellow clothing had left the store. He was battery-less and VERY icescraper-less. I watched him approach a bag of Funyuns on the ground that had just enough left in the bag to lightly weight it to the cement temporarily until the wind picked up at some later point in time.
 Muttering something incoherently to himself the old man raised his left arm and violently thrust the $4.43 I had given him into the mostly eaten bag of Funyuns. Several coins went scattering across the pavement. I laughed.

At that very moment several police cars went roaring behind me on Main Street, their sirens blaring far too loud in my ears, distracting me.

By the time I looked up, the old man had approached my window and was extending his hand towards my window. I glanced over just long enough to see him hand me a yellow post it note. Then he scurried off into the alley in a manner much too fast for his advanced age.

The yellow post it note read simply ""You did a wonderful thing for me today. So I'd like to recommend a movie to you. Buy a movie called ""Highway To Hell"", I haven't seen it in years cause its out of print, but when they re-release it I need you to purchase a copy straight away.""

And purchase it I did. I watched it at home. I sat in the middle of a circle of jars of pickles while I did so.
The movie was weird, dark,and funny. I liked it.

Ben Stiller makes a cameo.

If you don't want to be approached by a strange elderly man that is probably in several hardcore bands then I suggest you purchase this dvd today. You'll be that much better for having done so.",1503446400,5,3568,4.17467248908297

Great film and not to be taken too seriously. The plot is not earth shattering and the twists are obvious, but it is tongue in cheek camp at its best. The overall tone is serious and even though the film doesn't always take itself seriously, it is still leaps and bounds beyond 99% of the Troma catalogue. It is camp, but not ridiculous or over the top.

468307,5,6302462142,"I just finished watching Highway to Hell, an oddball fantasy-horror-thriller. The quality of the widescreen image is good without too much grain but a bit soft in detail, and the soundtrack (music, dialogue, effects) sound better than ever, though I can only compare it to my 25-year-old VHS tape. The blu-ray cover is reversible (two different covers- I prefer the retro 92 cover).

The commentary by European director Ate (pronounce: Ah-tuh) De Jong is terrific- this man recalls many bits of information- which crew member got an Oscar for LA Confidential, stunts that were dangerous, which actors went to-or-from David Lynch productions, the most economical ways that certain special effects were pulled off, where some scenes were shot, and problems between director and editor) with editing. The director seemed to like working with kindly Richard Farnsworth, and screenwriter Brian Helgeland was quite knowledgeable in mythology (which was reflected in some things that did-and did not- appear in the film) and liked playing ping-pong in his tiny apartment with the director. The film was shot in 1989; actor Ben Stiller improvised his dialogue (and appears with his mother, father and sister); among some odd cameos (such as Gilbert Godfried), Lita Ford enjoyed sexually vamping- up her cameo (which producer Mary Page disapproved of); the motorcycle gang in the film was a British rock group; the director wanted no green plants to be seen in hell, which was difficult to show in pre-digital days. The director elaborates on the storys theme of free will in the story without getting pretentious. Oh- and hell (in this movie) isn't all suffering, as its not based on Christian thinking, hence the odd partying atmosphere in the Hoffa desert club. Oh- and some funny improvised scenes are most likely long-lost film cuts.

Theres also a trailer (which looks and sounds remastered like the film itself), an enthusiastic, humorous interview with Steve Johnson about the creature effects- he explains why the creepy hell-cop has biblical epitaphs carved all over his face and difficulties with making-up so many actors as zombie-cops for the diner sequence. Theres also a short-but-sweet character and makeup effects montage- some of the makeup fx details I never noticed in the film. By all means, get hold of this disc if you like the original- itll never look as good as it does here again. If you're going to invest in nostalgia (for early 90s horror-kitsch), then look no further.",1455235200,4,2490,5.130541871921182

468358,5,6302462142,"Another great movie recently shown on MyNetworkTV that I had the pleasure of viewing and I absolutely loved it!

Charlie Sykes and his beautiful girlfriend, Rachel Clark are planning on running away to get married on Las Vegas. They take an abandoned backroad to Vegas, ignoring the warning of a gas station attendant named Sam, who recommended them to take the highway. Shortly after, they're pulled over by a demon cop who has a bald head, wears shades, has symbols carved in his face, and has a pentagram as a badge. His name is Sgt. Bedlam but he's simply known as, Hell Cop. Hell Cop attacks Charlie and kidnaps his girlfriend and drives off with her in the back of his police car.

Charlies goes back to Sam, who explains to Charlie who---or what Hell Cop is and that he'll have to enter Hell to get her back. Charlie is given a shotgun with ammo and a car that has a special attribute and can teleport him to hell . Charlie discovers that Satan had Rachel kidnapped because she's a virgin and plans on making her his bride. Once Charlie enters Hell, he'll have 24 hours to find Rachel and escape the depths of the underworld, or she will be Satan's property forever and he'll be stuck in Hell for eternity.

Once in Hell, Charlie confronts Hell Cop on numerous occasions but gets his car wrecked and is fatally shot during some of those confrontations. It's then when he goes to a mechanic named Beezle, who not only fixes his car but brings him back to life following Hell Cop's fatal gunshot. Beezle informs Charlie that Hell Cop is taking Rachel to Hell City to marry The Devil and gives Charlie instructions on how to get to Hell City and save Rachel from becoming the bride of Satan.

From there on out, Charlie is in a race against time to save Rachel from the evil clutches of the horned one and free her from the depths of hell before it's too late. Can he do it? Will he save Rachel in time or will time run out and spend an eternity in hell?

This is a really awesome comedy horror movie that's obviously not meant to be taken seriously. It has an enjoyable plot that will make you laugh quite a few times throughout. The makeup job for Hell Cop is tremendous though as I got chills the first time I got a look at him.
