the Berlin Philharmonic will want to have it. Be advised that it will play only on region 2 players
or all-region DVD players.",1483920000,,220,4.945945945945946
8428615,1,6302426448,"I bought this thinking it is the same as the Legacy for Home Video version which I already own and like very much. I tried to play it and got ERROR on my DVD player. This DVD is in PAL format, not NTSC as stated in Amazon's product description. Then I discovered that this is so called ""New Stereo and Surround Sound Re-recorded in Original Venues"", exactly as it means - the original music is played in the original venue and re-recorded. I am very disappointed that Amazon is not more careful (or non-existent) with its product description.
I am keeping this DVD because I am buying to bring to my sister who lives in PAL region. I have already opened the package. I suppose I can claim that this is a faulty product because product description says NTSC but product is actually PAL. I don't want to deal with the return hassle.",1281484800,5,830,4.431372549019608

8428617,5,6302426448,"I am very pleased that I purchased this video a while ago. I was most impressed with the way it is so well presented and indeed all the contents.

  Vladimir Ashkenazy is a renowned expert with "" Pictures at an Exhibition"". With his own deep knowledge he does the interpretation which he thinks is correct. You see him as a conductor both rehearsing and performing the work. He also does a live Barbican piano performance of the work in London ( there is magnificent piano playing in it). There are also other works he conducts and more bits from various piano recitals. It is all very well worth the money and I highly recommend it.",1155427200,,633,4.48695652173913
