7834248,5,6303013546,"I enjoyed this series on PBS ages ago. Leo Kern was a masterful actor. It was fun to watch him in action again. This collection was VHS, and I had no problem at all with the audio that other reviewers experienced from the DVD version.",1367107200,,234,4.222222222222222

7834250,5,6303013546,"This first series of Rumpole consists of 6 episodes and introduces the viewer to all of the main characters...ageing, cranky Rumpole who is a barrister in a law firm, and its oldest, regularly practising member...his wife, Hilda (she who must be obeyed) the daughter of the former Head of Chambers and the present incumbents of the Law Chambers with all their foibles. We also meet one of the leading minor crime families, the Timpsons, who regard Rumpole as their saviour as he has been able to keep them out of prison on many occasions. It's a light, amusing series and I look forward to reviewing some more as they become available.",1224547200,,635,4.72972972972973
7834251,5,6303013546,"Leo McKern is the embodiment of Rumpole's inner(and outer)self!

This series is unique, and we will not see its like again-every episode is a gem, and the standard by which lesser TV stories are to be judged. It's great to be able to savor these episodes many times over.

7834252,5,6303013546,"A delightful series of well produced and very entertaining episodes  featuring Leo McKern as Horace Bailey, the Wordsworth-quoting barrister of  London's Old Bailey and the characters that populate his world. These  videos are very faithful to John Mortimer's original stories. They  dramatically bring to life the pompous judges (e.g., Guthrie Featherstone),  inept managers (""Soapy Sam"" Ballard), upper class twits (Claude  Erskine-Brown), and of course She Who Must Be Obeyed (Hilda). A perfect  blend of very British humor, intriguing mystery, as well as a cultural  education in British jurisprudence.",965952000,,606,5.806818181818182
7834253,5,6303013546,"Horace Rumpole, the scourge of the Old Bailey, in top form in these two outstanding stories.  Wittily written scripts peppered with Rumpole's elegant renditions of Wordsworth make the stories a never ending source of  amusement. All the characters, from 'She who must be obeyed' to 'Soapy' Sam  Ballard are as strong and memorable as anything Dickens could offer. A  couple of hours of sheer pleasure!",925776000,,401,5.123076923076923
