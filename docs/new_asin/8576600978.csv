7901185,1,8576600978,Thought we had found a gem but it turned out to be a rotten tomato.  Somebody copied a bad VHS tape of the concert onto a DVD and tried to pass it off as the real thing.  Run from here and don't stop!,1333584000,5,200,3.627906976744186

7901188,4,8576600978,"This is not a collection of video hits. This is Sheena's ""Act One"" television special from 1983 with guest stars Al Jarreau and Kenny Rogers, and Johnny Carson makes a cameo appearance. The DVD is a Brazilian release with the menus and extra text in Portuguese. It is in the NTSC format that plays on American DVD players. The transfer is from a tape that has some background hiss and an occasional video defect that crosses the screen. The color and picture quality are good. The menu offers 2.0 (stereo) and 5.1 audio options that are not correct. The stereo selection plays sound out of front, center, and rear channels; the 5.1 selection plays sound out of the front and center channels. The original broadcast was mono-channel for television, so I suspect, and the best I can tell, all channels are the same content.

With that technical crud out of the way, this is Sheena early in her career and she is fabulous. I have memories of watching this special when it was broadcast and I am very happy that it was captured and made available on DVD. Sheena performs the following songs: A Song For You, For Your Eyes Only, He's A Rebel, Last Night At Danceland, Roof Garden (with Al Jarreau), We've Got Tonight (with Kenny Rogers), I Am The Entertainer, On My Own, Madness, Money And Music, and The Wind Beneath My Wings.

The show included a few minutes of the BBC documentary taped three years earlier when  Sheena was auditioning for a recording contract - really cool. I enjoy this show very much. Sheena is in great voice and is gorgeous. Any fan of Sheena would love this DVD.",1172534400,22,1583,4.586572438162544
