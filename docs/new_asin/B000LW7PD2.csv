8164748,1,B000LW7PD2,"This is great and wonderful educational video. I give it low rating only because - I ordered the 2007 version, assuming it would be different from the prior 2003 version (which we already have) with new interviews, updated aircraft & squadrons working on a carrier. Both are identical.",1300838400,,285,4.958333333333333
8164749,4,B000LW7PD2,"If your kids are interested in anything Navy this will be a great DVD for them.  This film gives a basic overview of life and work on an aircraft carrier, covering everything from the captain down to the mess hall, with no over the top stupidity on the part of the participants (as is far too common in a lot of videos of this type for children).  It includes some interviews with pilots and others who work on the carrier.  My  boys (aged 4-11) really enjoyed it.",1214611200,,464,4.2988505747126435
