8427947,5,B004FN25BA,"I saw this series via Dish Network and think it is one of the best shows on the subject ever. It is on par with the best episodes of The Universe. I recommend it whole-heartedly for anyone that is interested in space science. The graphics used are top notch.

However, I think the high price, $20 for a 50 minute episode is just too high. On top of that, what they are selling is DVD-R recordable media. That means that when someone orders it, they will take a blank DVD and record it for you.

As much as I like this series, I think this is a terrible way to market it. If they were to package it as a set, DVD or Blu-Ray, at a reasonable price, then I would buy it and recommend that all of you reading this buy it. But, as it is, I have to say I'm not buying it and you shouldn't either...",1298592000,5,792,3.9748427672955975
