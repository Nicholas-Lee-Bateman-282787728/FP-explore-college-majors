8163712,4,B000LQJSBA,"I bought this because the dance studio that I attend only offers samba sporadically.  I figured that if I could get something beyond a basic box like a simple walk and a turn or two from this DVD, it would be worth it.  The content exceeded my expectations and takes you from absolute beginning steps to what I'm assuming are intermediate Bronze Level steps.

This is the first video by the Lamperts that I've purchased and I really like it.  The teaching is clear and well-paced and there is a sample routine at the end of each section where the patterns for that section are tied together.

I only gave it four stars though because this DVD appears to be a copy of an older, non-HD tape.  The picture quality is not as good as the Johnson and Kozak DVDs, but it's good enough to see the patterns being danced in detail and there are a lot more patterns on this DVD.

All in all this a good value for the price.",1196812800,3,912,4.267441860465116
