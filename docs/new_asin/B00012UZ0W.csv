The english voice is very loud, but the spanish voice is like a whisper, which is opposite of what it should be.  I liked this as an introduction for olders babies and young toddlers only.  It is not exciting enough to maintain the interest of an older toddler.",1219276800,,329,4.190476190476191

& learn both the spanish & english words together.
Very cute & fun to watch.",1182211200,,159,4.3

THANK YOU and BRAVO!!!!!!!  Or should I say, ""OL.""
As a mother of semi-bilingual children and as a public school teacher of ESOL and foreign languages at the grade school level in Miami, FL.,  I am thrilled to have come across your products...which I now use at home and, occasionally, in the classroom. My young children and students are captivated by the colors and images and readily absorb the basic vocabulary presented and are now better able to distinguish their use in the different languages (English - Spanish of HOUSE-CASA) ...undoubtedly the combined audio and visual stimuli meet the needs and interests of the computer literate, video-game oriented youngsters.  I have recommended the purchase of HOUSE-CASA to parents of elementary school children with limited English proficiency (LEP, recent arrivals to our land-pais) and also, to parents of monolingual/English-only children who wish to help their youngsters establish a foundation for Spanish and other languages. I believe the earlier a child is exposed to other languages the better the chances or aptitude for learning various languages (multilingualism), general vocabulary and writing skills. Too bad you weren't around 15 years ago when I first started to teach in this multilingual environment...but, please, keep up the good work and get some more titles out for pre-school and kindergarten... ASAP ... French and Haitian Creole would be ideal for Miami!!!!! And get more support materials on the shelf: books, posters, games, etc.
Gracias y mucha suerte! (Thanks & good luck)
Sincerely,
Lourdes Ines

8483348,5,B00012UZ0W,"I have two kids who adore this dvd.  My 4 1/2 year old says all the spanish words and loves to quiz himself with the accompanying book.  My 1 1/2 year old squeals with delight as soon as the opening credits come on, and the dvd holds his attention for the entire time (it is the only way I can take a shower!).  My 1 1/2 year old also enjoys the book and it is helping him learn his first words.  I would highly recommend this dvd as well as the book to all kids.  It is also a pleasure to watch as an adult, unlike some of the other videos on the market.",1079654400,3,555,3.8333333333333335
8483349,5,B00012UZ0W,"My two year old absolutely loves this video and is even starting to count in Spanish with the video and on his own.  I think I'm picking up some Spanish too.  He really like seeing the children playing and giggles with them.  The part with the horse puppet is his favorite.
It's such a nice change from the videos or TV shows with music that grates on your nerves after awhile.  I'd definitely recommend this video since my son is really learning from it(and Barney makes me nuts).

8483350,5,B00012UZ0W,"This is truly an innovative learning tool.  It is not only a tool to teach your child a second language, it also reinforces strong language skills.  And the use of the two sided visual and audio examples is a great way for children to understand the two languages.  I also found that this video uses familiar items that any child can relate to which makes it both entertaining and educational, unlike some other videos which just use abstract imagery that has no meaning to a child.  My niece was completely engrossed by the tape.  She repeated each word and tried hard to pronounce them correctly.  After her first viewing she continued to ask for the ""casa"" tape.  I have given this tape as a gift to friends and family who are having children.  They all love it.  A great concept.  A true educational tape whether you are interested in the bilingual aspect or not.",1079395200,,867,4.571428571428571
