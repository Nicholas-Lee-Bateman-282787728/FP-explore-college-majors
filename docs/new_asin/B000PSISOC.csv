8193055,5,B000PSISOC,"I am honored to be the first one to review this collection. I have watched many, if not all of these episodes over and over again. If you ever had a boss you hated (and haven't we all) these are great to watch. Each of them is a tribute to the mindless workforce stupidity of a boss who lives only for his job and expects his abused workers to do the same in a variety of very funny situations suggested by the titles of each episode. Watch them all and save the Christmas episode for last because that one you won't be able to stop watching.",1177718400,3,542,4.122641509433962
