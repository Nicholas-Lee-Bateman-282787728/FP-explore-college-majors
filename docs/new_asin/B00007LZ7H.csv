This movie was not what I expected .It should have been called Crazy Love Life, because it was some crazy things that was going on in this movie. I did not like when the two guys was naked around that little baby girl. I love Luke Goss even the small part he played. The over all movie was crazy. If you like crazy and confusing and flipped out stuff then this is your movie.",1247184000,3,525,3.9622641509433962
