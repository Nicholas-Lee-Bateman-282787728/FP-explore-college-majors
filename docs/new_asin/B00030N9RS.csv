I was hoping for a little bit more out of this DVD.  It does provide a few self defense techniques.  However, it doesn't tie these techniques to the GoJu Ryu katas very well.  (I'm a GoJu Ryu black belt myself.)  There also weren't very many self defense techniques on the DVD, so I felt the DVD was a bit short on content.

A significant portion of the DVD is allocated to video of a demonstration by Sensei Chinen and his students that was conducted in Las Vegas.  While this is interesting, it is not training material.  There is only one camera angle used and so it is not easy to see what is going on.

So overall, I find the DVD interesting because it is GoJu Ryu and Teruo Chinen is good at what he does.  But it does not give very much self defense information and it does not tie it well to the GoJu Ryu katas.  So I find the content a bit lacking relative to other DVDs that Sensei Chinen has produced.",1276128000,,1010,4.149484536082475
