5525709,5,B00AX9DNWK,"I had never heard of this, and really enjoyed it. Stupid, funny movie which isn't going to teach you anything. You pretty much get the idea from the cover art. Boobs, scrotums, and S&M themes feature prominently. Characters are likable, violence is mild and cartoonish (think road runner/coyote), sex takes place offscreen and there's not a lot of swearing. Still, definitely not for children.",1481414400,2,393,5.15625

5525712,4,B00AX9DNWK,"Did not know what to expect. I was surprised.  It is funny and fun. The movie does have adult language, jokes and comedy in it. Graphics are ok, the overall content is good.",1480723200,,173,4.242424242424242
5525713,4,B00AX9DNWK,"Fun adult animation.  Definitely not for the kiddies. Lots of big, jiggly boobs and huge men in g-strings. Several fun homoerotic laughs. And a fun love story.",1480723200,,159,4.888888888888889
5525714,1,B00AX9DNWK,this DVD would not play on my player. can only watch it on my laptop.,1473120000,,69,3.6666666666666665
5525715,4,B00AX9DNWK,"This cartoon is for adults only but it's real fun. This is a parody for Barbarians movies. It reminds me ""How to train your Dragon"" also.",1472515200,,137,4.3076923076923075

5525721,5,B00AX9DNWK,Funny adult movie. Great parody of Conan with fun dialogue.,1484697600,,59,5.0
5525722,5,B00AX9DNWK,"Its so hard to find an adult oriented animated movie that funny and still tells a story. This one is definitely not for children, despite the art style. Y'know what I liked so much from this is that you can clearly see that a lot of time and effort went into creating this movie. I loved how it pokes fun of so many of the overused material in movies nowadays, yet it still feels like an original movie. Nicely done. Again though this movie is not for children.",1484611200,,461,4.25

5525726,5,B00AX9DNWK,Was a good funny movie,1483920000,,22,3.6
5525727,1,B00AX9DNWK,Neither original nor funny.  Stale humor.  Couldn't make it through more than a half hour.,1483833600,,90,4.933333333333334
5525728,2,B00AX9DNWK,"I enjoy watching anime,but this one was grasping at a over used moral .  Which is okay, it was the way it was delivered that didn't help it to me. The lack of substance.  If the language wasn't as harsh , it would be a good children cartoon.  Just not for me.",1483747200,,259,3.9423076923076925

5525733,5,B00AX9DNWK,This movie turned out to be quite a surprise...funny and satyrical,1483315200,,66,5.090909090909091
5525734,4,B00AX9DNWK,"If you want a light-hearted amusingly vulgar take on the sword/sorcery genre then this is it. The movie doesn't pretend to be anything other than it is - a teen romp through the genre complete with Amazons, Barbarians, evil wizard (minor character) a warlord and guys who ride flying monsters, all in cartoon (CGI) form then this is it. This is a comedy that doesn't try to be anything else and it works. I gave it 4 stars because it is not pretentious and it achieves its aim.",1483228800,,477,4.431818181818182

5525742,4,B00AX9DNWK,A hilarious adult animation that is surprisingly well-made.  This is a must see for those that enjoy comedies with adult situations. The humor will make your face sore.,1482537600,,168,5.0

8558802,3,B00AX9DNWK,"This is a very funny movie, but don't think it will play on a standard DVD player. It would play on my computer only with Media Player after it searched for info on the web as it is in a very unusual format for DVD.  I have a LG DVD/BLURAY player and a conventional DVD player and neither would find the disk or play it.",1485907200,,320,3.923076923076923
