1386022,4,B000050IMX,"I love these 8-minute workouts!  I have both the buns/legs and arms/abs DVD.  It's super easy to squeeze in one or two 8 minute sessions in the morning before work plus they really do seem to work.  Best of all the people aren't annoying or boring. One thing that's really cool is that there is no counting -- they tally reps by time (eg: 30 seconds doing this, 1 minute doing that, etc.).",1045612800,16,389,4.301369863013699
1386023,5,B000050IMX,The Buns workout is the best out of all of the 8 minute work minute outs. It is hard at first but it is well worth the effort. The 8 minute strech is a great addition to the DVD.,1015545600,14,178,3.58974358974359
1386024,5,B000050IMX,I had used this video plus 8 Minute Abs in the past and loved both. I lost this one and just replaced it. I still love it!,1361923200,,122,3.5555555555555554
1386025,5,B000050IMX,This is great for a home workout!  It really makes a difference in how my clothes fit.  I use it three times a week.,1361577600,,116,3.7916666666666665
1386026,5,B000050IMX,"Love this!! really simple and basic, - but yet challenging - and lots of fun! The Guy Jaime Brenkus - SUPER!!! Very motivational!! Excellent instructor!! Definitely would like more work outs from him!!! I will look him up on the internet.  It was originally made back in the 90's so you can tell that the whole thing is dated - but old basics is sometimes better then new and so challenging that you really just don't want to do it.  I'm a former personel trainer, former aerobics instructor, been working out for 25 years, so I'm pretty knowledgeable.  If your quick on time, and you want to just get something in - better then nothing - then this is it!  I would buy everything from this guy if he's still making workout series!!!  Thanks Jaime!! Your SUPER!!  And for the person who made the comment about his ""materials"" - that's what all male and female instructors wore back then!! Even big Body builders!!!",1291939200,2,913,4.570552147239264
1386027,5,B000050IMX,My product came quickly and in great condition just like the description said.  I am completely satisfied and would definitely buy from this seller again.,1213315200,,154,5.16
1386028,5,B000050IMX,"Quick Stats: I'm a 35 year old 5'3"" 145lb single mother of three teenagers with a flabby butt and legs that needed a good workout I could actually endure and stick with!

I absolutely adore this work-out DVD.  I have about 20 DVDs that do nothing more than collect dust and another ten that I actually use.  Of the ones used this one remains at the top of the list in the DVD Player in my bedroom as a daily workout each morning.

Each exercise is short and concentrated on the areas advertised.  I love how it's done by a timer rather than repetitious counting and you can keep an eye on your progress via the ""dotted start to finish line"" that's shown on the screen at all times.

The instructor is also easy to listen to and encouraging without being too boring or too silly and annoying.  He does a great job!  And the film does a good job of letting you see exactly how each exercise is done rather than zooming in on the 'cute face' like many do it gives a good overall look and a few zooms to the areas of the body that actually matter.

You really can't go wrong with this workout DVD.... Honest!",1168732800,6,1104,4.219047619047619
1386029,5,B000050IMX,I have had problems in the past regarding my motivation to do workout plans. This series (buns and legs in particular) is great for me because it's only 8 minutes long! No huge commitments must be made to keep up with this program! I'm positive this series will work wonders on any with motivation problems.,1167091200,2,307,4.6
1386030,4,B000050IMX,"I initially skeptical and thought it would be too easy.  But after I tried it, I found it to be a VERY EFFECTIVE workout.  I totally feel the burn (even though I've done exercises similar to these before on workouts like The Firm's Buns/Hips tapes which I love).  One of the keys to it being so effective is that NO TIME IS WASTED in between movements, you are constantly doing 30-45 seconds of one motion, then doing 30-45 seconds of another motion.

Instead of counting the number of repititions, the instructor goes by time;  I like this because beginners can easily do the exercises at a slower pace if the need to, without being distracted by what the instructor is counting. Also, since each exercise is only 30-45 seconds, I don't get bored with it.

I liked the ""countdown"" indicator on the side of the screen because it gave me an idea of how much more is left of the workout, so it motivates to just finish up the next 5 minutes, 4 minute, 3 minutes.

This is a no frills workout, doing LOW IMPACT (no jumping or marching) ISOLATION exercises.  The instructor has good form.  I think this workout is challenging for even intermediate users. For advance people, all of the exercises can be done with ankle weights (I would recommend trying it without weights first, then once you get the hang of things try a 1 lb ankle weight, then increase weight as you get stronger)

A nice thing about this video that isn't advertised is the fact that is has several different BONUS WORKOUTS that are very cardio, so this workout ought to rival the other mix-and-match exercise dvd's out there.

BUNS - 8 minutes

squats

lunges

butt kick (leg shoot outs while in table position)

bent leg press (leg lifts while in table position with knee bent)

butt lift (leg lifts while in table position with straight leg)

STANDING - 8 minutes

squats

quad lift

outer thigh raise, butt press

inner thigh raise

hamstring curl, butt lift

outer thigh lift, squat(if you have bad knees, you can do just the outer thigh lift)

lunge front/back

bent leg inner thigh raise

plie, calf raises

BONUS TRACKS

Stretch 8min

Jamaica Me Swet' 10min (dance aerobics)

Gilad Step Aerobics 20min

1386031,5,B000050IMX,"I just love these 8 minute workouts.  I do the abs one every day and can see the results where I never did before.  The buns workout is a real killer.  The sweat pours down my face and I always swear at Jamie and call him a sadistic SOB for putting me through this torture, but I keep coming back to it.  It feels good when you get done and your buns are burning as they say they will.  I also do the arms workout when I am in a hurry.  I do alot of walking so I usually skip the legs workout.  Don't listen to the negative comments, these are fantastic workouts!",1123632000,6,563,3.9292035398230087
1386032,4,B000050IMX,"Once you look passed the cheesy instructor and the 90s haircuts and pay attention to the excercises... you'll get a wonderful work out!
And it's great for people who have a busy day... just wake up a little early and dedicate 8 minutes of your life everyday to this DVD series and you'll start noticing the change within weeks!",1064880000,8,327,4.559322033898305
1386033,5,B000050IMX,"This workout REALLY BURNS... Even after 3 weeks use, I pant & sweat as soon as I finish the workout.
