688518,5,6303585914,"Although this film centers on Deafness in France, the closely related language, culture and people appeals to American audiences.  ""In the Land of the Deaf"" is as moving and telling as any documentary on the Deaf World I have seen.  Covering issues including: Deafness and the Arts, Oral Education, Total Communication, Cultural Divides, Abuse and Misunderstanding, Young Adult Life, and the Joys of Deaf Community and Successful Inter-cultural Relations...this film is a MUST SEE for members of every academic dicipline who claim some connection with humanity.",1136851200,6,561,5.511627906976744
688519,5,6303585914,"Deafness merely happens to be the subject of this extraordinary documentary. Sensitive and unobstrusive, good camera work, wonderful rhythm, great story telling, sense of humor, no axe to grind and thus all  the more moving. All the same adjectives apply to Philibert's ""La  Moindre des choses"" about patients at a clinic outside Paris  rehearsing for a play.",949104000,5,359,5.2631578947368425
688520,5,6303585914,"I am a student of American Sign Language, and saw this movie in my class. I was surprised at my reaction to forcing the children to learn to speak. According to my instructor, who herself is deaf, this is very true to life.  I recommend this movie to parents of children who are deaf or hard of  hearing before making any decision about forcing a child to speak just so  that they can be ""normal"".",927072000,17,397,4.266666666666667

688715,1,6303585914,In the land of the deaf the was not a good movie for deaf or hearing.. my husband is deaf and he could not understand it . And I could not understand it either..  would not buy it am sending it back,1402617600,,198,3.7142857142857144
688716,5,6303585914,I love it beautiful and well made.  I use every day.  I recommend to all to purchase it. It is Ideal for a gift present.,1397433600,,120,3.76
688717,5,6303585914,I can understand about their culture and it is learning process for hearing people. I urge all people to watch it so they can understand how a deaf person communicate and the way their life goes,1384646400,,194,4.416666666666667
688718,5,6303585914,"Although this movie takes place in France and is older 1980's, this is the sad reality of many deaf children who are mainstreamed in public schools. Emphasis is on lipreading and speech at the expense of development of other knowledge, which could come through a knowledge of a signed language (like American Sign Language - ASL). It was sad to see the children struggling to learn what would be simple tasks for children who could hear. How far behind their development must be. I felt sorry for the young deaf boy who was so timid and was yelled at by his teachers for doing poorly. It was also sad to see the struggles many of the deaf adults related about their growing up years.

The person with the most confidence and best development seemed to be the ASL teacher, who had confidence in teaching his hearing students how to communicate with deaf persons.

Those who are culturally deaf, will understand what this movie portrays, because they experienced it. Feeling like a pariah amidst your own family: what could be more degrading and sad?",1379808000,3,1048,4.721311475409836
688719,3,6303585914,Needed closed caption... was very broke up... hard to follow and I didn't watch the end.very boring movie yuck yuck,1363737600,,115,4.8
688720,5,6303585914,"This documentary is a must see for anyone interested in the deaf and hard of hearing culture.  Please share with parents and teachers of deaf and hard of hearing children as well for a better understanding.  I watched the documentary for first time in early 90's. Also have been looking for a copy to share with others my experience watching this wonderful documentary.  Truly touching and similar experiences to connect with a few of the people in the movie.

688721,5,6303585914,"I have watched this film twice. What doesn't seize to surprise me is the soundtrack of it all. It may seem to be lacking music for the most part but I wish I had a recording of the sound of this film exactly as it is, it has a rythm that is hard for me to explain. I also enjoyed the many levels of good storytelling it has.",1217894400,3,324,3.7794117647058822
688722,5,6303585914,"I saw this documentary in 1992, and it has stayed with me for 15 years!  I came to Amazon looking for a copy so I could watch it again.

The film is mostly interviews of French deaf people, and their comments are eye-openers.  One man tells how his parents used to come by the orphanage (!) where they'd deposited him to take him to movies; he'd come back and tell the plot to the other deaf kids.  Another woman talks about how she likes the sign for ""head in the clouds,"" and demonstrates why (charming!).  I think she's the same one who said she lived in a school for the deaf and could never figure out what happened to deaf people when they turned 18.  Did they get taken somewhere?  Did they die?

Highly recommended--obviously.",1192320000,,734,4.385185185185185

7851376,5,6303585914,I am deaf and highly recommend it to those who want to learn more about the various ways deaf grow up in a hearing world. The situations in this documentary are common to every country. When I taught sign language I had my students watch this.,1498176000,,243,4.304347826086956
7851377,5,6303585914,great read,1486944000,,10,4.5
7851378,5,6303585914,"Fascinating! I'm just beginning to learn ASL (American Sign Language), and I know some spoken and written French. Since you see French Sign Language and hear French in this film, it was really fun to try to follow along. I pretty much imitated the signers as I watched, trying to guess the meanings (many of the French signs were similar to ASL or could be guessed through context) and improve my facial expressions when signing. In terms of the stories of the Deaf people in the film, some elements were very sweet, fun, or encouraging - while others were troubling or frustrating. It was really good for me to see different Deaf people's interactions with Deaf and hearing people around them. I got pretty irritated when the wedding wasn't set up well for Deaf participants - including the couple getting married! And it was sad watching Florent look so upset and ashamed. I wish I could have seen him in a community of Deaf people, just laughing and enjoying himself. But watching the confidence and fun Deaf people had when interacting in sign language, or their faces light up when they successfully communicated in a hearing environment, or seeing a story told in sign (so descriptive!) was really fun. This film is great if you want to sign along for practice, see French Sign Language in action, and get a glimpse into various aspects of Deaf life.",1459036800,2,1356,4.725738396624473

7851381,2,6303585914,"This nice little film is in French Sign Language (FSL)...so if you are learning American Sign Language, like I am (I'm deaf) this book will not help you at all.  Different language different signs.",1440633600,,197,4.794117647058823
7851382,1,6303585914,"I am deaf, I was taught to speak and I am glad I can talk.  You do have to live in a hearing world.  I would not live in a deaf world, I am sorry to say this but sign language is limited.  Very very sad when it is assumed that the deaf cannot learn to speak.",1432425600,,258,3.491228070175439
