8302903,4,B001FWY00I,"Attention Gym Bunnies: I have found your new favorite exercise video! Katie Butler's Back to Basics is the perfect training video for those who live for the gym.

This is an exercise video you can take to the gym if you have an iPod or MP4 player. Choose your fitness level: beginner, intermediate, or advanced. Then, download the appropriate level to your player. The 37 workout clips are enough to keep you occupied and fit for months to come!

Katie Butler acts as a personal trainer and shows you how to use the weight machines, free weights, as well as a few floor exercises.

When you choose your appropriate level, I'd suggest watching the entire series of exercises before loading them onto your player. Not only does Katie Butler offer great tips after each exercise segment, but it'll help you make the most of your gym time.

If you don't have much experience with the gym equipment used in this video, I highly recommend you get a consultation at your local gym before implementing the routines in this video. A ""live"" trainer can show you how to adjust the machine according to your body type and weight.

Once you've been fitted to the machines, use Katie Butler's Back to Basics as your personal trainer.

My recommendation for using this video in the gym: As you take a breather before you move on to the next routine, use this time as an opportunity to watch the next exercise clip, which are all under two minutes.

You can't find a personal trainer anywhere for $9.99 which makes this video an incredible deal! Gym membership not included. ;-)

Katie Butler's Back to Basics makes a great stocking stuffer or buy it as a New Year's Resolution gift for yourself or a friend!",1260921600,3,1692,4.635451505016722
