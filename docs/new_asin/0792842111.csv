151198,5,0792842111,"Wow. There are a lot of unhappy bunnies out there. Silence of the Lambs is, in my view, one of the great thrillers. It is, however, NOT a horror movie.
That's not to say it isn't grisly, but there are no monsters about  to leap out of the closet (well, apart from Hannibal) and tear you apart.  Much of the violence is gruesome rather than scary, and adds to the general  feel of the film.
I can understand totally people who dislike the film.  It was hyped to a great degree when released, and a lot of people expected  a chase 'n' slash horror. It was never meant to be that.
The comparison  to Psycho is purely valid and perhaps one of the most telling. Psycho did  use chase 'n' slash horror as well as the more morbid psychological horror  (mainly engineered by Hitchcock). SOTL relies far more heavily on the  latter, and brings it off far more effectively.
The only true chase scene  is in the final five minutes: heroine against villain. Even Lecters escape  is more of a planned action rather than a bloodfest, which happens to  involve murder because it was required in the plan. Even Lecters unseen  murders (as were Bill's) were carried out as a necessary means to an end  (to eat flesh or to skin them).
I'm sure that this review will generate  it's own barrage of response to counter my points. But my final thought on  this is: Art is intended not only to appeal aesthetically, but to stimulate  discussion and thought. If this film has done this, then can it be  considered art? If not, then surely it should just be enjoyed as it is; a  modern thriller.",926467200,,1570,4.426573426573427
151199,5,0792842111,"Absolutely as scary a movie as Hollywood could ever produce.  The acting, writing, cinematography, and dramatic lighting effects are awesome.  The story, based on my favorite book by Thomas Harris of the same title, is  incredibly chilling. FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is  assigned to an interview with ""Hannibal The Cannibal"" Lecter  (Anthony Hopkins), who is, without a doubt, the completely immoral  personification of evil.  Hopefully, Lecter will aid in the capture of  another grizzly murderer who skins his victims.  The plot twists and turns  as will your stomach.  However the explict and grizzly visuals are sumptous  rather than repulsive.  However, this film still can not be recommended to  the squeamish.  Anthony Hopkins makes the most of his part and leaves you  with an impression that will haunt you forever.  If you like the movie,  read the book alone in the dark, which will also send chills up your spine.  Nightmares Gaurenteed!
The movie also won five accolodes from the  Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.  Including Anthony Hopkins  only Oscar which he won for Best Actor, and Jodie Foster's for Best  Actress.  It even won Best Picture of the Year.",923356800,,1201,5.103626943005182
151200,5,0792842111,Anthony Hopkins is at his best in this thriller about a serial killer who keeps luring the police and FBI off course.  Jodie Foster does an outstanding performance as an FBI special agent who uses Hopkins to catch  the serial killer.  I love this movie and I will watch it over and over.,920246400,,287,4.377358490566038

151202,5,0792842111,"Travel into the world of Clarise Starling, a smart and attractive FBI trainee who is eagerly waiting for her graduation so she can become an agant for the Behavioral Science section of the FBI. She is sent on a mission from the BS sections cheif Jack Crawford to try to get some case information from one of the most famous crimminals ever, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a.k.a. ""Hannibal the Cannibal"", a genius serial killer who ate parts of his victims. Clarise is hoping to get some information on another killer, nicknamed ""Buffalo Bill"", who has been killing women and doing strange things with their bodies. Lecter leads Clarise on a maze with his word and mind games to gain more information, when suddenly, Katherine Martin, Senator Ruth Martin's daughter, is kidnapped by Buffalo Bill. Now Clarise must use Lecter as her main resource to find Buffalo Bill so Katherine Martin can be safely rescued in this race of time.  This is my favorite movie, and everything about it is absolutley amazing! Jodie Foster's award winning performance is stunning, as it that of Anthony Hopkins, who is more than terrifying. It's a classic movie in my book.  END",886550400,,1146,4.841836734693878

151381,4,0792842111,"This was a very good film. But I can't understand for the life of me why it garnered so many better reviews than Manhunter did. Manhunter was, in my opinion, a superior film. Nevertheless, this film also had its moments.

Jody Foster plays an FBI recruit who has a knack for solving difficult problems and situations. She is mentored by Agent Crawford and asked to assist on a serial killer case. This leads her to meeting Hannibal Lector (Played In Previous Film By Brian Cox) played by Anthony Hopkins in his Academy Award winning role. Foster's character, Clarice Starling grew up lower middle class and Lector is able to detect this once the two converse. Starling disobeys orders and tells Lector all about herself in a ""quid pro quo"" arrangement so Lector can assist in nabbing the killer who soon kidnaps another girl.

I won't go into too many more details as others have done that better than I could. I liked this film as pure drama but I feel it was a bit too dark and garish for my tastes. Too, why would Buffalo Bill toy with Agent Starling when he could have killed her. With his night vision goggles he could see that she was armed and ready to fire. Thus he would not have cocked his pistol in her presence (He Had Plenty Of Time To Do That Earlier) because she would have heard it and slain him as she did. That was contrived. Perhaps it was in the book. I don't know. But if that's the case then the scene in the book was also contrived.

I give this film Three and a Half Stars. You might like it if you buy It on DVD. I'm the 1910 person to review this film. I saw it from an old tape I made from cable.

151721,5,0792842111,"The Silence of the Lambs was a fantastically well-done movie. There was a redundant shot I felt they overused, but it was done well too, just got a bit annoyed with it. Center screen close-ups, The actor would be looking into the camera as well. It was real cool at first, but that got overused. Perfect movie nonetheless. No jump scares, yet extremely suspenseful, and kept me leaning towards the screen wondering what's about to happen. The foreshadowing is just spectacular as well. They don't show any gratuitous gore, but they don't show it very cleverly, even though you know it's happening. Even when Hannibal escapes, it's brutal, but they show minimal, with great effect. The dead bodies were gross, but it wasn't shown when it was done, only talked about how it was done. Kinda like Bones in a way. I'm super happy I watched that. they should've related it to how moths are attracted to light unless we're supposed to realize that ourselves. The three main actors, being Hannibal, Buffalo Bill, and Starling were all just great. Everyone else was believable as well, but they stole the entire movie. Especially Hannibal. This movie is stupendous. Go watch it if you haven't yet. Just perfect.

151726,5,0792842111,"What can be said that hasn't been already? Though this movie often gets labeled a ""psychological thriller"" to reconcile its Oscar wins, this is as true a horror film as you can watch--it's truly, genuinely horrifying. The grotesque artistry these serial killers display is undeniably unsettling, but the emphasis on close-up shots, on facial recognition of the terror at hand, gives the proceedings a very personal sense of terror. You'll come watch for Anthony Hopkins' legendary turn as one of cinema's most iconic, imitated villains, but you'll stay for Jodie Foster's underappreciated work as Clarice--this is the sort of sensitive but steely, energetic but nuanced movie-star performance you only hear about in fairy tales.

And I will submit Buffalo Bill walking toward the camera with night goggles as one of the single most frightening images ever to be ingrained in my subconscious. That this recurring shot is part of a flawlessly enthralling third act is icing on the cake.

152478,5,0792842111,A classic!,1480982400,,10,4.5
152479,5,0792842111,"I *never* give five stars except for classics, but this film has held up over the years and has become a true classic, in my opinion. Yes, it has some disturbingly violent scenes and it deals with some of the dregs of humanity. And yet, by shining the light in those dark corners where the human cockroaches live, it shows us what it can mean to be human if we are not afforded a decent upbringing or help when mental health issues *begin*, rather than when they get out of hand. It also raises the question of whether some people are just born evil and are beyond redemption.

Juxtaposed against the worst of humanity is Jodie Foster as the fresh-faced, hyperintelligent yet somehow innocent FBI agent, who can look at the worst that one human being can do to another and still continue her mission to find and stop the perpetrator. Add Scott Glenn as her world-weary yet still optimistic mentor and you have a team that got their man, even if other forces let another evil slip through their fingers.

I've lost count of how many times I've seen this movie. Somehow, I never grow tired of it. Whenever I am flipping through channels on TV and I find it, I will start watching it wherever it happens to be at the moment, even if it is in the middle or near the end. With most movies I *have* to watch them from the beginning but I know this one so well I don't need to fill in the blanks. Sometimes it concerns me that I am so fascinated by such a dark movie about extremely disturbed characters, but I have always been fascinated by the workings of the human mind. This represents, for the most part, one end of the spectrum, with Clarice Starling's character as the opposite end. Good against evil - a tale as old as humanity. It's no wonder so many people find this fascinating.",1480982400,5,1782,4.3969696969696965
152480,5,0792842111,After all these years it's still as good as the first time I saw it. It is not only exciting but instructive.

Also it has memorable and interesting characters, including one of the most thought provoking horror characters ever, Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Anthony Hopkins does a top notch performance of the manipulative psychiatrist who's mere existence blurs the lines between intellect and savagery.",1471564800,6,424,5.343283582089552

152565,5,0792842111,"The two contrasting traits of Hannibal Lechter, brilliance bordering clairvoyance and cannibalism, make him a fascinating character to watch. And his protagonist, the unthreatening, plain, innocent FBI trainee Clarice Starling, provides even more contrast. Hannibal exposes human traits as he heals Clarice from a childhood trauma and avenges her violated honor by persuading a fellow inmate to kill himself by swallowing his own tongue. The staggering suspense and fears for the victim Buffalo Bill holds in a shaft of his house culminate in Clarice's shootout with Buffalo Bill.",1469232000,,580,5.6022727272727275

152581,5,0792842111,"This is about as perfect as a movie can get; Silence of the Lambs (1991) is a psychological horror/thriller movie that has all the elements of greatness: the right setting (outer city neighborhoods) at the right time of the year (autumn), thrills, hair-raising suspense, great acting, great directing, great plot, great script, character development, etc. This is one of those movies that draws in the viewer, and when done watching it, begs to be seen again right away (sort of like loving a certain roller coaster, and wanting to ride it again right away). Anthony Hopkins gives a chilling and unbelievable performance as Hannibal Lecter, a scary figure with incredible wit and an elusiveness that makes his character that much scarier. Jody Foster shines as the heroine Clarice Starling, an FBI apprentice who embarks upon the case of a lifetime, and succeeds. Both Foster and Hopkins are stellar, and elevate the film to a higher level of expectation and entertainment. The music is very well done, and really illustrates the darkness and cold world of Hannibal, as well as Clarice. The Silence of the Lambs is essential to anyone's movie collection, as it has tremendous replay value. The special features are very good, and are a great bonus to this iconic movie.",1468886400,,1269,4.990566037735849

It had been awhile since I've seen this, and it still holds up pretty well. Anthony Hopkins was great as the charming, but psychotic cannibal Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Jodie Foster plays an FBI Agent named Clarice Starling, who is given the task to talk to Dr. Lecter and seek his help on capturing a serial killer named Buffalo Bill. He goes after overweight women so he can make a suit out of them. If you love crime thrillers, you'll love THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS!!!",1465689600,,664,4.588235294117647

From the beginning the story engages you. The quiet of Jodie Foster's Clarice helps to lull the viewer and makes the introduction of Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal that much more sinister. By putting the focus on the Doctor's eyes, the viewer cannot help but be sucked into the film and join in the hunt for Buffalo Bill (played very very well by a pre-""Monk"" Ted Levine) .

153155,5,0792842111,"Silence of the Lambs (1991) follows the story of the young and ambitious Clarice Starling in her attempt to apprehend the serial killer named Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). Starling goes to the infamous Hannibal Lecter (nicknamed Hannibal the Cannibal for his exotic tastes). Clarice relies on Lecter for his expertise and knowledge about the mind of a serial killer. Whereas Hannibal toys with Clarice in order to amuse himself. Clarice and her fellow agents are forced to rely on the help of a killer in order to catch another.
 Jodie Foster does an excellent job playing the young and eager Clarice. She portrays her Southern accent as often painfully obvious, which Lecter pounces upon as an insecurity. Foster speaks with a wavering voice at times, showing Clarices inexperience and disgust with the crimes committed by Buffalo Bill. Hopkins is completely absorbed into the role of Hannibal Lecter. To create his creepy and psychotic persona he stares unblinkingly, forcing both the audience and Clarice to return his cold gaze. Hopkins keeps as still as possible while acting, looking like a snake poised to pounce upon less intelligent prey, and in comparison to Lecter everyone is less intelligent, and is therefore potential prey. Hopkins keeps a soft smirk on his lips throughout the film as if to say he knows something no one else does.
The films soundtrack is absolutely haunting and mysterious. It works well with the film to create tension and anxiety in the audience. However, the director (Jonathan Demme) knows when silence is just as powerful. In a tense scene in complete darkness we are left with no sound save for the heavy breathing of Buffalo Bill. The cinematography is excellent for this film. The colors of the film are gray and lifeless, which complement the films dark subject matter. At pivotal moments the camera angle switches to first person. This view works perfectly when Clarice rounds the corner and sees Lecter for the first time. We are able to truly appreciate Lecters piercing gaze, because we see it first hand through Clarices eyes.
The performances of Hopkins and Foster would have been flat if it were not for the well written script. The small anecdotal stories about Lecter help to build his character even before we meet him.  Lecters lines are meant to sound sophisticated and cultured in order to create his paradoxical character as a gentleman-psychopath. Buffalo Bill refers to his victims as it in an attempt to destroy their humanity in another example of brilliant writing.
 A key strength in this film is its character development. Not just Lecter or Clarices development, but their relationship itself. The audience watches as Lecter and Clarice grow closer and closer in a bizarre exchange not unlike two friends sharing secrets. As Clarice learns more from Lecter, so too does Lecter learn more about Clarice. The audience can see that Lecter values this relationship because he does not hunt her down for as Clarice puts it, He would consider that rude.
 Silence of the Lambs is a gripping and disturbing film, filled with fascinating characters. It remains a timeless horror film that draws from the darkest and foulest corner of humanitys existence. It is a terrifying movie because it reminds us that the monsters in our world are not imaginary, but could pass us on the street any day.",1456185600,,3345,4.978533094812165

153162,5,0792842111,"Yesterday, February 14, 2016, marked the 25th anniversary of the release of The Silence of the Lambs, one of the greatest crime thriller movies of all time. Its an odd date for a movie release to be sure, but it certainly didn't hurt this film either at the box office ($131 million) or at the Academy Awards. Its one of only a handful of movies to sweep Oscars in all five top categories: Best Picture, Best Actor (Anthony Hopkins), Best Actress (Jodie Foster), Best Director (Jonathan Demme), and Best Writing-Adapted Material (Ted Tally).

The FBIs top criminal profiler, Jack Crawford,  assigns a young agent trainee named Clarice Starling (Foster) to conduct a routine field interview with the infamous Hannibal Lechter, a serial killer notorious for dismembering and eating his victims  hence earning the nickname Hannibal the Cannibal. Crawford (played by Scott Glenn) hopes that Lechter (Hopkins) can give insight into the motivations behind a new series of grisly murders being committed by a psychopathic killer known only as Buffalo Bill.

During the interview, which is conducted in the maximum security psychiatric prison where Lechter is held, Hannibal the Cannibal uses his twisted intellect to get into Clarices mind and under her skin, thereby creating within her doubts about herself and her ability to help find and capture Buffalo Bill. But Lechter has a much larger and more sinister agenda in mind, and he plans on using Clarice as a means to achieving his ultimately horrific goals

The Silence of the Lambs is a terrific film in nearly every respect. It is, in equal parts, a psychological thriller, police procedural, and horror film. Each part is magnificently brought to the screen.  Foster is superb as the up-and-coming FBI agent, who is, at the same time, ambitious, superbly competent, and keenly intellectual. Hopkins is deliciously malevolent as the evil, wily Hannibal Lechter.  The film is tightly woven, suspenseful, thoroughly engrossing, and abounding with enough plot twists to keep viewers guessing for the films entire two-hour runtime.

Ive watched The Silence of the Lambs many times over the past 25 years, and every time Ive found myself sitting on the edge of my seat in fascination as Clarice and her FBI colleagues face off with Hannibal Lechter, while seeking to bring Buffalo Bill to justice. Most highly recommended.",1455494400,,2367,5.12987012987013

153201,2,0792842111,"The Silence of the Lambs, 1991 film

A new FBI employee is given an assignment: to interview a mad serial killer. [Was this payback for her earlier questioning of Jack Crawford at her college?] Clarissa Starling visits Hannibal Lecter in the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, and converses with him. She deciphers his cryptic advice ""look inside yourself"", visits the storage facility that Hannibal rented, and finds a body part. In another scene the film shows how a killer takes advantage of a woman's help to a stranger. [Isn't this after dark activity a little bit suspicious?] When her body is examined in the funeral parlor it becomes a case for the state pathologist. [Did that Sheriff really need those six Deputies there?] They find a cocoon inside the body, a rare species that will leave a paper trail. [Are state entomologists that buggy?]

Clarisse makes Hannibal an offer to get his help. When this is revealed as a scam (by the prison psychologist!) the scandal results in Hannibal's transfer to a Memphis prison. [Can you believe this?] Next the story shows Hannibal cleverly escaping from his cage. Could those police be so easily fooled? Clarisse drives to Belvedere Ohio to investigate the background of the first victim. [Don't the FBI travel in pairs?] Clarisse follows the trail to the sewing lady, Mrs. Lipman. She talks to a suspicious person. [Why didn't she call for backup?] This action keeps your attention!

This horror film has a slight redeeming value. It warns against making assumptions about strangers, no matter how innocuous they may appear. But I can't believe the local police could have overlooked that suspect. This film implicitly argues that serial killers should be executed, no good comes from keeping them alive for study. This film mocks the people in it. The experienced profiler follows a false clue to an empty house, the rookie finds the killer with basic police work (questioning all the associates of the victim). At the end (in Haiti?) it implies there will be a sequel. The killer in this film seems to have copied the modus operandi of some real serial killers. Serial killers are always sane because they know the difference between right and wrong. Their efforts to conceal their crime says so. [""Hannibal Lecter"" seems to be loosely based on Ted Bundy.]",1447891200,,2329,4.951406649616368

153214,5,0792842111,"Johnathon Demmes The Silence of the Lambs (1991) is perhaps an anomalyits not your average slasher horror film or predictable thriller, which have come to dominant the genre.  The haunting performances and psychological interaction between the characters, coupled with the presence of a strong female character, makes for an eerie production that brings raw emotion into the thriller genre.

Based off the book by the same name, The Silence of the Lambs depicts the strange and emotional relationship between FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) and cannibalistic serial-killer Dr. Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins). Clarice is sent by FBI agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) to consult with Dr. Lector about Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), an illusive serial-killer running rampant throughout the US.  However, she must open up to the sadistic killer in order to gain his trust.

The plot is undoubtedly intense and well-written.  However, its not so much the storyline as the performances of the actors that make Silence a must-see.  Hopkins control and almost monotone high-pitched voice takes sadistic lines to a whole new level.  His gaze brought shivers down my spine as he delves into Clarices psyche.  But Clarice can hold her own against the former psychiatrist.  Foster plays her character as young and innocent, but not to a fault.  She uses Clarices naivety and lack of experience as an advantage to stand up to Lector, which he, in turn, finds admirable.

In a way, there are two antagonists of this film, and one of them surprisingly isn't Hannibal Lector.  The FBI not only has to fight against Buffalo Bill, but Clarice has to battle a chauvinistic society.  Being one of the only females in a male dominated field, she doesnt get the same respect as some of the others.  However, Silence does an excellent job of portraying Fosters character as confident and strongand even more cunning than the veterans of the FBI.  A strong female presence not only adds to the storyline, but is also the crucial element in the relationship between Dr. Lector and Clarice.  Though a sick man at heart, Dr. Lector recognizes the corruption in the system, and protects Clarice.  They form a bond that is not often shown in horror movies.  Though their only interaction is through Clarices interviews, this makes their conversations that much more intense and emotional.

While the emotional connection is the focal point of the film, the climax of the movie is not to be forgotten either.  Its suspenseful, quite creepy, and adds a string of scenes that even avid horror fans will find unnerving.  Enhancing the climax is the score created by Howard Shore.  Some thrillers give away the pivotal moments with obnoxious music, but I found that Silences soundtrack actually aided the development of the climax.  Rather than being loud and boisterous, its subtlety makes it evermore creepy, and still haunting to this day.

The Silence of the Lambs is well-deserving of its five Academy Awards awards, but those awards don't define the filmrather its boldness makes this movie a classic.  Demme isn't afraid to address topics such as transgenderism and feminism.  He doesnt shy away from giving Lector human emotions.  And call me crazy, but he almost makes me root for a cannibalistic serial killer.",1443657600,2,3297,5.0686456400742115

Alot was very different from book, so much missed that to me made the story. The ending was totally off from book as well even tho I know they have to twist up to make it a point where we are waiting for next movie but I guess thats were my reader comes in. Overall was ok. Inside comes two dvds and also some little cards with recipes named example as Fava Bean Risotto and if you've read  book you know were the beans come in to play. My recommendation is if you for some reason enjoyed movie READ THE BOOK it is 100% better.

153253,5,0792842111,"The Silence of the Lambs, based on the Thomas Harris book of the same name, is one of the most disturbing films based on fictional material to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Director. When you consider that films like ""My Fair Lady"", ""the Sound of Music"", ""Driving Miss Daisy"", ""Rain Man"", and ""Forrest Gump"" have also earned the Best Picture prize, Lambs sort of stands alone. Best Picture Films which match Lambs on the disturbing meter are predominantly set in historical situations, such as Platoon, Gandhi, the Hurt Locker and Schindler's List. Possibly the only other fictional Best Picture winners which could compete with the horror of Lambs is ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""Unforgiven"". But none of these movies ever dealt with not one but two serial-killer sociopaths in a suburban-rural setting.

Despite the outstanding quality of this horror-suspense film, ""Lambs"" is not for the feint of heart. ""Lambs"" centers around three characters dealing with intense psychological dysfunction. Each character in turn not only reacts to their dysfunction in their own style but each is in very different circumstances. Two of the three engage in horrific behavior of extreme violence, succumbing to the darkest side of human behavior as a result of their mental illness and dysfunctional pathology. At the story's beginning, one of them is in an institution for the criminally insane, having had a history of violent and sadistic behavior. The second is on the loose, dispatching young women for reasons yet unknown. The third character deals with her psychological issues by joining the FBI, and her reason d'etre becomes a mission to stop violent behavior and rescue potential victims at the hands of sociopaths.

If a ""story"" is about the growth and change of a character, then Lambs' narrative is really about Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee who is majoring in the Behavioral Science division which does psychological profiling of criminals, particularly serial killers. Her first real task, or test in a sense, is to psychologically profile the serial killer Hannibal Lecter, nicknamed ""the Cannibal"", played with such a believable yet sadistic sensibility by Anthony Hopkins that make Dracula and Frankenstein's monster seem more like Saturday morning cartoon villains by comparison. Lecter is possibly one of the most fascinating and simultaneously repulsive characters in fiction and film. He is a fusion of an Ivy League liberal arts professor who easily quotes ancient philosophers and the Monster of Venice, an Italian serial killer who dispatched victims, usually women, without a shred of empathy. But Lecter also has a fondness for high culture, displayed by his drawing of the Duomo in Milan. Italy.

We learn Lecter had been a university professor of psychology who made it a habit of eating human victims. At story's beginning, he resides at a prison of mentally disturbed criminals where Starling first meets him in person. Starling and Lecter form a strange yet compelling bond, not quite true friendship but something more meaningful than mere acquaintance. Part of the story is the evolution of Starling's and Lecter's relationship. A very subtle undertone of sexual flirting is hinted at in some scenes and yet we know that these two worlds could never permanently mesh.

Eventually, Starling begins to solicit the help of Lecter to arrest the perpetrator of the horrid acts of the second character. At film's beginning, we learn the FBI is hot on the trail of a strange woman-killer, nicknamed Buffalo Bill by the press. Buffalo Bill has dispatched five women, but no one at the agency can figure out his motive. With Lecter's help, Starling begins to unravel who Buffalo Bill is from a psychological standpoint as a means of finding out his identity and where he lives. Part of the narrative involves the revealing of both Starling and her target Buffalo Bill, although the most interesting and colorful character, Hannibal Lecter, remains completely enigmatic. The story then pushes into a new direction when a young woman from a prominent family is kidnapped and it is believed she has been abducted by Buffalo Bill. Can Starling extract enough information from Lecter to save the young woman before Buffalo Bill dispatches another innocent victim?

One of the first elements that strikes you about Lambs is its foreboding atmosphere with some scenes having a quasi-medieval flavor. When Starling first visits the corridor inside the mental prison which houses Lecter, you feel like you're walking into a medieval dungeon. The stone brick is dirty and damp, and the inmates seem like something right out of Dante's Inferno (Hell). The same is true for Buffalo Bill's hideout, a maze of dark corridors filled with strange objects, like mannequins and costumes. The place where he imprisons his victims rings of something out of the Spanish Inquisition. Themes of raw sexuality permeate the entire story, although there is no love affair between any of the characters. Simultaneously, there are also overtones of objectifying human beings. Dr Chilton, the doctor in charge of Lecter at the hospital, boasts of having his sociopath patient, ""So rare to capture one alive. From a research point of view, Lecter is our most prized asset,"" as if Lecter is a rare object rather than a person. Also, the serial killers objectify their victims as a means of rationalizing their behavior.

""The Silence of the Lambs"" is one of the best horror-suspense films of its type with absolutely first-rate acting by the leads and the supports. And one of the most disturbing. But if you're looking for escapist innocent fun, Lambs will have you running under the covers, or at least switching to ""My Fair Lady"". Lecter and Buffalo Bill are the stuff nightmares are made of.",1433808000,,5836,5.112159329140461

153279,4,0792842111,"THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS based on the novel of the same name by Author Thomas Harris
who was obviously influenced by serial killers Ed Gein, Ted Bundy & John wayne Gacy.
FBI agent Clarice starling (Jodi foster) gets Help from Dr Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins) to help find serial killer Buffalo Bill
who murders women to cut off their Human skin for his own pleasure
this film is more suspense thriller than a Horror, most of the plot is Psychological suspense thriller with some Horror elements
the only big Horror scenes is where Hannibal Lector attacks the 2 police Guards when they both come to serve his Dinner
Hannibal bites in to the Guards face taking a big chunk of the side face with Blood & Gore everywhere
where he gets the opportunity to escape his prison cage
apart from that the rest of the film is a big Suspense thriller, tons of suspense for sure
Brilliant performances all round in this film
Jodie foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn,
incredible performance by Actor Ted Levine who plays serial killer Buffalo Bill who uses womens skin to Dress up in
you actually see Ted levines Character sewing skin together & trying to wear some of it, pretty scary
the main serial killer inspired in this film is Ed Gein who murdered women in his hometown of Wisconsin Texas in the 1950's
and skin them to use their skin as Decoration around his House he also Dressed up in their skin aswell
the Texas chainsaw massacre is another film heavily inspired by Ed Gein as Leatherface would wear Human skin masks

this Silence of the lambs was first released on DVD as special edition back in 2001
with all new special features added to the film
Into the Labyrinth Documentary, 60mins retrospect making of Documentary with new cast & crew interviews from the film
interview with Executive producer Gary Goetzman, Producer Ron bozman,
screenplay writer Ted Dally, Production designer Kristi zea and other crew members to,
new interviews with Anthony Hopkins and Ted Levine & also one of the victims from the film is interviewed aswell
Actress Brooke smith
the only cast/crew missing is Director Johnathon Demme, Actor Scott Glenn & Jodie Foster
there's also the 1991 TV featurette, Outtakes reel, Deleted scenes, Photo stills Gallery

the new blu-ray version of this film has all the exact same special features carried over from the special edition dvd
but the picture quality is not excellent, infact it's slightly better quality than the old dvd release
so the blu-ray quality is sharper & clearer in 1:85:1 widescreen than the old dvd, but there is still some Grain & Dirt
so could've easily been a much better High definition transfer
but for some reason 20th century fox did not make a big effort with the picture quality, tragic really
this film deserves more respect with the picture quality
they did not make a big effort with sound quality either, it's a new 5.1 master audio mix but only little bit better than the dvd mix

there is some new extras thou that 20th century fox did add to this blu-ray
a picture in picture feature BREAKING THE SILENCE where you get interviews with cast & crew
giving their recollections working on the film while you watch it, the interviews pop up in square box on the screen
a new 15mins featurette scoring the silence which is Howard shore being interviewed about the Music score
a new 40mins Documentary from Page to screen which is TV broadcast Doco
plus the usual special features from the old dvd release
INTO THE LABYRINTH, Deleted scenes & outtakes, Theatrical trailer tv spots
all this on 1 Blu-ray Disc incredible

so if your a big fan of the film, your better off buying the blu-ray release which has old & new special features on 1 Disc
better than the old dvd release
4 stars i gave it based on so many special features & slightly better picture quality than the old dvd
if the picture quality was extremely clean & clear my rating would be 5 for sure",1425686400,2,3912,4.67343976777939

153285,5,0792842111,"What more can be said about this movie? It's a classic crime thriller, suspense drama, horror movie; it wears as many hats as Hannibal himself. Its first charm is the underdog protagonist, Clarice Starling, played expertly by Jodie Foster. Clarice must do all she can to overcome a lower-class childhood that was cut short by her father's tragic death. The sympathetic hero is opposed by a multitude of villainous characters, not the least of which are supposed to be on her own side. Aside from the hideous Dr. Chilton and her job's bureaucratic gloryhounds, Clarice must also deal with psychotic murderers Hannibal Lecter and Jame Gumb. The only ones on her side are boss Jack Crawford, who often finds his own hands tied by the job, and her roommate, the benign Ardelia Mapp. In battling the inner and outer forces that hold her back, Clarice fights the good fight, and all of us who have our own disadvantages to conquer cheer her on. Representing the opposite of her extreme need for order are the chaotic figures of Lecter and Gumb, the former civilized, sophisticated, and incarcerated, the latter reckless, flamboyant, and all too free. Anthony Hopkins applied his stage discipline to the role of Lecter and created a household name. Hannibal is one of the most popular of all movie villains, right up there with Jason Voorhees, Freddy Krueger, and Leatherface.  The voice and body movements Hopkins used to transform into the monster are on par with anything Lugosi or Karloff ever pulled off. Besides the fact that this movie intertwines the heroes and villains in a highly suspenseful police procedural format, the twist ending, achieved with seamless simultaneous editing, completes the package and elevates Silence of the Lambs to the level of true classic. Incredible story, amazing acting, and expert directing; you can't ask for more than that.",1425081600,,1860,5.019417475728155

Anthony Hopkins's performance as a genteel sort of cannibal serial killer is exquisite, and Jodie Foster walks a fine line between being extra vulnerable due to her gender and showing her strength while overcoming obstacles as a woman in a man's job.

I really enjoyed that the two main characters had depth to them - neither was a perfect angel or a perfect monster.  This is definitely more sophisticated than your average horror movie, but still very scary.  The person next to me was so scared that he was gripping me for moral support, and I won't lie - my heart was racing at several points.  Even though I had seen it before and knew how it all turned out, I was still terrified for the characters!",1415232000,,864,4.477707006369426

153338,5,0792842111,SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is a mesmerizing tale of the most heinous of nightmares come true as FBI agent Clarice (Jodie Foster) is immersed into an abyss of the darkest side of deviant human behavior where the flesh eating Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) agrees to assist her in her investigation to capture a serial killer who commits unspeakable atrocities on his victims. Jodie Foster must traverse into a world of dark sickening debauchery to capture the killer. The story takes several turns heightening the intensity and unspeakable terror of her assignment. The story is unsettling in its own right but the film seen from Foster's perspective has a pervasive feel of paranoia as if she has not been given all the information she needs or even further to suggest she is actually being set up as bait. One scene in particular comes to mind when sitting in the back seat of the car her boss (Scott Glenn) speaks cryptically to her and she just gazes at the back of his head once he turns around. You really don't know what either character is thinking. Very disturbing.,1414713600,,1074,4.748663101604278

Her mission involves an interview with a demented prisoner, who may be able to give her clues to the killer's next move. Anthony Hopkins plays the role of the prisoner, a psychiatrist, who is mentally ill, and extremely dangerous.

Clarice is fore-warned before interviewing the prisoner, to not allow him to get inside her head, which was an impossible task. The prisoner bargains with her to help her follow the footsteps of Buffalo Bill, as long as she conveys a dark secret about her past. She agrees, but isn't sure if she would be strong and stable enough to fulfill her mission of finding Buffalo Bill, and saving the life of his most recent kidnapping.

The chilling story becomes edge-of-your-seat suspense, and the ending is as frightening as the beginning as you follow the actions of the prisoner's scary intentions. Jodi Foster and Anthony Hopkins give Outstanding Acting Performances, and this movie is packed with thrills-and-chills throughout.

From the beginning of the movie I was drawn right into the plot.  Foster and Hopkins are just amazing in this film.  It almost seems as if Hopkins was born to play this role.  If you haven't seen this movie, the basic premise is that Jodie Foster is a young F.B.I. agent on the hunt for a serial killer.  Cue in Hannibal Lector, a cannibalistic genius who provides Fosters character with clues and insight into how to find the elusive killer.  Overall, its an extremely entertaining movie that Ive seen at least four or five times.  It never seems to get old.  Probably still my favorite of the franchise.  It is definitely a must see film.

153715,3,0792842111,"Jonathan Demme was in a unique position when he made this quasi-art film back in 1991. A director more accustomed to comedies and ""normal"" mainstream projects, he was probably not the first choice to guide the reins of this out-of-control monster movie (but, as it turned out, he was the best choice). Sometimes, placing a horror film director behind the scenes of a straight drama film can work wonders, and occasionally putting a musical director behind the chariot of a blockbuster thriller can provide small miracles. It's a matter of reconstituting the elements in a different frame. Sometimes, the layered skills of a director can provide the same decent palette strokes upon a previously non-traversed canvas as it can upon familiar stomping grounds, but often this will produce more effective results. Move the mind of a musical adapter into the playing field of a horror story and you may get something spectacular as a result. ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" as a result, almost gets there.
The most obvious thing to say is that Jodie Foster is both desirable and stirring in her role; she has never been better, or more attractive (at least not in my opinion). Anthony Hopkins, however, takes a previously literary character and moves his ghostly mind play into an empirical creation that would have worked better from the shadows than with definable features but, nonetheless, here we go again. Critic Gene Siskel attacked this one because of its gruesome subject matter, and, more importantly to relate, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" does not have much to offer on the visual side of things (other than the radiant Foster), as its bleak, distressing, and bloody canvas becomes a bit too much to take at times. The purpose of Demme's film was to transfer the big ugly monster that is serial killers on the loose in modern society into the mindset of a mainstream Hollywood thriller script, and lure audiences into the debate by using hyper-violent and sensationalized characterizations to overstress the point. What history will make of a film that tries to build the anxiety of modern living by introducing fear of the unknown person (those hidden individual killers amongst us) is quite difficult to assess at this point. In the age of increasing technology and social media, the job of the serial killer is now (thankfully) more difficult in modern society, but there's also something human that we are going to lose by giving up so much of our privacy and our renegade sensibilities. Rather than questioning this aspect of modern police work and FBI tampering with the lives of citizens, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" ends up being about the unreliable aspects of basic thriller filmmaking. It really doesn't have much to do with reality, and this aspect is very disturbing to me (as a critic). Serial killers had become the new vampires and werewolves back in 1991, and this film goes towards that sensibility with full-steam ahead. I also did not care for the Buffalo Bill character. Demme did a great job in building the tension--and there are certain aspects of its mystery genre writing that make the film fascinating in some of its minutia (I love the insect studies angle, for example)--but overall this is a softened version of what a great serial killer portrait should be, meaning that it is manipulative, loaded, and too interested in becoming a horror film effort that it fails to gain its sense of verisimilitude once it decides to move beyond the bounds of reality (starting with Hannibal's escape from prison, one of the more ludicrous ""c'mon audience, accept it now"" moments in the film). I have not witnessed this one proper in a theater setting yet, so maybe I'm being a bit harsh, but overall the effort is quite mediocre. However, there are enjoyable moments--not the content, but in the pacing, the scares, and the music (by ""The Fly"" composer Howard Shore, of all people). It might be a female empowerment movie, but it's not the best showcase for that idea even.
The BluRay is nice--although the extras take the study of serial killers a little bit more seriously than this entertainment vehicle is capable of competing with (these FBI tidbits are more disturbing than the actual movie). The ""From Page to Screen"" documentary is an essential item, however, discussing the source text of author Thomas Harris (a wise, elusive literary figure), and how the disturbing novel was translated to the more dubious idiom of film. To me, though, the most powerful supplement on the BluRay is the deleted scenes. Watch these if you decide to purchase this title. The inclusion of these deleted moments made me question as to whether or not the movie might have been stronger had these been left in. Definitely a must-see. The DVD included is rather pointless though, because it is basically a copy of the movie without the extras (something that a great company like Shout! Factory would never permit in their detail-precise endeavors). So, overall, if you want a good mystery story, this is by no means a terrible movie, but it was a way too overly hyped movie for its time. However, it might stand up better in future, who knows? To me, there is a certain nostalgic value to it, and I enjoy it on that FBI/cop movie-thriller level--it's as good as one that you'll find from the 90's.  AND, finally, as one other note, I don't agree with Siskel that we have to censor such movies as this one. What we need to teach in society is self-control, not cultural control. Once the lunacy of the moral crusades of the Christian right and conservatives starts to make film goers feel guilty again, we are in danger of losing the point of cinema in the first place (which is to express cathartic dreams, not to try and compete with reality). America is about freedom (or, at least, it is supposed to be), and we can't place restrictions upon our art. If we take away expressions of our darkest dreams and nightmares (from fantasy revenge violence to pornographic imagery to controversial themes such as cancer in the young), then what are we really doing as humans? It is possible to defend this film and not just attack it because of its tasteless subject matter. But I wouldn't label it a classic just yet. C+",1392768000,,6221,4.824906367041199

Every performance is excellent and directorial decisions that would sound disastrous when talked about work so well that you never even think about them until you really examine the film objectively.

Anthony Hopkins may only be in the film for about twelve or so minutes but he radiates such madness and danger that his presence is felt even if he wasn't on the set when a particular scene was being filmed.  Dr. Hannibal Lector is certainly a villain worth remembering.  Jody Foster is his equal in FBI trainee Clarice Starling as she does her best to not get sucked into the doctor's sickening mind games while attempting to create some of her own.  Scott Glen portrays Jack Crawford, Starling's superior whose weariness can be sensed with every word and motion as he does whatever he can to hunt down the vicious serial killer ""Buffalo Bill"".  And speaking of Billy, Ted Lavene is a great addition to the cast and one can only wonder how much he was paid to act so disturbed (I couldn't come up with a performance like that on my best day.)  The actors all did their homework on serial killers and the people who strive to catch them and that effort paid off.

Jodie Foster must traverse into a world of dark sickening debauchery to capture the killer. The story takes several turns heightening the intensity and unspeakable terror of her assignment. The story is unsettling in its own right but the film seen from Foster's perspective has a pervasive feel of paranoia as if she has not been given all the information she needs or even further to suggest she is actually being set up as bait. One scene in particular comes to mind when sitting in the back seat of the car her boss (Scott Glenn) speaks cryptically to her and she just gazes at the back of his head once he turns around.

153907,4,0792842111,"The first time I watched this movie, I was between 15 and 17 years old. At the time, I couldn't understand why it wasn't trashed. 5 oscars for this kind of movie, that's insane! Was my original opinion. Then I watched it a few more times with an open-mind. Jodie Foster, Scott Glenn and of course Anthony Hopkins, all played their parts brilliantly. Then there's Anthony Heald, who played the annoyingly flirtatious Dr. Chilton, and Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill, was excessively creepy in many ways. What baffles me about this film now though, is why the gay-community was so angry over the praise it received. Now, granted, I'm part of that community myself, the difference is, I try to be fairly analytical in most cases, even with movies. Point 1: buffalo bill was not a transsexual,a closeted homosexual or even transgendered. Point 2, Dr. Lecter's profile on buffalo bill seemed pretty clear-cut for me, I feel like I was the only gay/bi-sexual person paying attention at the time, am I wrong? And finally point 3, Jeff Dahmer's killings weren't revealed until two years after this film was released. Director Jonathan Demme also made Philadelphia in 1993, to point out the problems with homophobia, to me, the gay-community didn't see the whole movie or cheery-picked the parts they didn't like to make their case. On a different note, I still say Eminem was sucking up to the gay-community by performing with Elton John, but that's a debate for another time. Final note: Silence of the Lambs, creepy, atmospheric, but emmensely effective, and obviously not for everyone.",1373760000,,1575,4.924812030075188

153960,5,0792842111,"Silence of the lambs is truly a remarkable achievement. One of only a small handfull of psychological horror films to truly deserve a best picture academy award for 1991. Jodie Foster makes a striking comeback as the emotionally uneven yet determined FBI agent, Starling. It is interesting to note that Silence of the lambs is probably the best remake of any film ever made. In the early 80's Michael Mann directed the original based on the same novel. In that version William Peterson took the title role of a similarly fragile FBI agent unsure of his own sanity. Mann's film was really very good, and the villian of that one was not Hannibal Lector though the character appears in the film. The serial killer portrayed in that film had Tom Noonan in the role of the murderer known as the 'Tooth Ferry'. And again it was a much better film than the boxoffice receipts really indicated. Silence of the Lambs still proved to be a much better film, so that is saying a lot. Of course Sir Anthony Hopkins created a truly terrifying character in Lecter, and it won him a much deserved best actor oscar. Hopkins is truly astonishing playing Lector. Jonathan Demme directs this film with heart pounding realism and a slick pace. Ted Levine is in top form as the killer on the loose. Interesting as well is how Levine managed to break free of of being type cast after this movie. He went on to play good guys mostly, usually cops over the past 18 years since. In this version of the book Starling must follow the trail of the killer with the help of Lector and her superior played by Scott Glen. Foster also delivers an academy award winning performance, and Silence of the lambs remains one of the greatest thrillers ever made.",1371427200,,1721,4.590909090909091

She closes in on the murderer and after some tense moments she finishes the job a hero. Now a certified FBI agent, Starling gets a call from Lecter who had escaped previously.

Clarice Starling works very hard and is regarded as an exceptional student at the FBI Academy. Jack Crawford, her mentor and teacher, enlists her help to present a questionnaire to Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant but deranged psychologist infamous for cannibalism, manipulation, and murder. He scoffs at her attempts and sees that her mentor actually wants his help in the current serial killer case, where the murderer known as Buffalo Bill skins women. After a disgusting act from another inmate, Lecter decides to help her by giving her a riddle to solve. This marks the start of their odd relationship where he provides information and insight in return for details on her personal life. Clarice will face her own personal demons as well as a deranged killer before she has even become a full fledged FBI agent.

Clarice Starling is one of my favorite horror heroines. She's focused, dedicated, and strong, but many around her don't see her this way. Upon my latest viewing, I noticed that Clarice is very often underestimated and out of place, mostly because of her gender. She is very often surrounded by tall, imposing men when doing anything in relation to the FBI (at the academy, at the autopsy, etc.). The cinematography of these scenes gives the viewer Clarice's point of view and, in comparison, she seems small and meek, perhaps unsuited for the job frequently associated with strength and masculinity. Many men in the film agree with this assessment of her. Dr. Chilton hits on her immediately, seeing her only as a sexual object purely base on her appearance. After being rebuffed, he completely changes his demeanor from friendly to cold and singlemindedly seeks to undermine her. Even Crawford, her mentor, uses her as an uninformed pawn in order to fool Dr. Lecter, ignoring her ability to consciously persuade Lecter to help them. Hannibal Lecter dismisses her as an annoyance at first before she intrigues him and, of course, Buffalo Bill merely sees women as objects to be torn apart and sewn together. All of these factors make Clarice's chosen career difficult for her to venture into and become successful purely based on her gender.

Clarice proves to be a strong, formidable woman, even to those who doubted her, by never backing down in the face of opposition. She succeeds where Dr. Chilton had failed for years in forming a connection with Hannibal Lecter and gaining his trust. Dr. Chilton, on the other hand, inadvertently allows Lecter to escape. Crawford follows a false lead to an empty house while Clarice finds Buffalo Bill by accident and kills him. This scene is one of my favorites because of what it shows about Clarice. When the lights are turned off, she is obviously terrified, frantically trying to feel her way around and listen for Buffalo Bill. The second he makes a noise, she turns and empties her gun into him and immediately reloads. It shows how she feels emotion, which is a stereotypically frowned upon trait of women, and it doesn't interfere with her ability to be a good FBI agent. Jodie Foster portrayed Clarice wonderfully with a perfect balance of toughness and vulnerability.

So many aspects of this film came together to make it exceptional. Anthony Hopkins is excellent as Hannibal Lecter with his trademark intense, unblinking stare. Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill is odd and disturbing, especially the infamous Goodbye Horses dance and the perfect delivery of ""It puts the lotion on its skin."" The film score by Howard Shore supports and enhances each and every scene and I can never hear Bach's Goldberg Variations the same ever again.

The Silence of the Lambs is an excellent film. I can watch it with fresh eyes and discover something new about it even after I have seen it many times over the years. It's one of those special films that transcends its time period. Sure, there are cues all over the place (clothes, phones, hair styles, etc.), but they are incidental in the face of the intensely interesting characters and the chilling plot based in reality.",1359676800,,4065,4.911208151382824

Not only do Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster act in the most profound and Oscar worthy performances of their careers, Ted Levine as the villian is remarkable. Not to give anything away, but the part at the end of the movie with Ted Levine and Jodie Foster in the basement still is creepy and scary to me. It is the overall everything about this movie that makes it amazing to me, such as the scenery, the humor of the bug experts, the creepiness of the prison warden (Anthony Heald is great), the violence at the caged prison at the courthouse (you don't see it all, but the implied violence is better than seeing the actual physical violence) and the flashbacks to Clarice's childhood.

154187,5,0792842111,"I've seen this film quite a few times.  But probably for the first time last night (2012Oct19), I watched it in HD and completely uncut.  I saw the edited-for-TV version before, and the differences aren't few.  I would recommend seeing the original version again if you haven't already.

Between 1991 and today, I've seen and read quite a few true crime movies and books, and that really helps as well.  For example, the screenplay borrows from Ted Bundy:  a man with a supposed broken arm in need of help to lure his victim.  From Gary Ridgeway:  victims murdered and placed in a river.  From Ed Gein:  a guy who liked to keep trophies - in particular, skin - from his victims.  I'm quite sure that the writer of this screenplay borrowed from these true-life events.

One interesting thing that I hadn't thought about before while watching:  the Jodie Foster character is being ""groomed"" for her position by both her boss and Hannibal Lecter.  There are scenes where both men hold Ms. Foster's hand and there are closeups I believe on each.  This surely was intentional by the director.

While I love this film - I think that it may be the best serial killer film ever - I do think that there were issues, of course.  One of them:  most real-life serial killers look just like everybody else.  Think Mr. Bundy and Mr. Ridgeway, once again.  Really think Paul Bernardo, especially to you ladies.  Now, the killer in this film is definitely odd, and I think that he could be spotted from a mile away.  They do make reference to this at one point to be fair; Ms. Foster says something like, ""Usually, transvestites are quite passive.""  But still, I think that they might have been better served to have a killer who was more ""normal.""

But you surely can't go wrong with this excellent film, especially around Halloween.  A big recommendation by me, of course.",1350604800,,1858,4.625766871165644
154188,2,0792842111,"I truly hate this movie. It disgusts me. I'm not sure how else to put it. I felt like the movie tried to somehow glorify the character of Hanniabl Lecter and that was extrememly offensive and unsettling to me. I've sworn of all other horror movies because of this one. It touched on things that were way too real for me.

EDIT: I have decided to update my original review because I realized it was neither informative nor well-balanced, and I felt I should clarify some of my thoughts on this movie. Originally, I gave this movie a one star. I chose to add an additional star because even though the content of the movie deeply affected me (in a negative way), I can't deny that it was extremely well-made and superbly acted. It is a classic among horror films and is much higher in quality than many that exist in the genre. However, that being said, the Silence of the Lambs is not for the faint of heart. I found the movie overwhelmingly dark and heavy. It was the type of movie that stayed with me for far longer than I cared for. If you love horror movies, especially ones that are realistic and psychologically terrifying, you should totally check this movie out! If you're easily scared and disturbed (like me), this isn't the movie for you.

In my original view, I claimed that I thought the movie tried to glorify Hannibal Lecter. I felt this way watching the movie because he is portrayed as being this extremely intelligent individual who somehow possesses superhuman strength and the ability to remain a few steps ahead of every other character at all times. In other words, he is completely unmatched in skill, ability, and strength. Maybe I'm wrong, but I sort of got the feeling that audience members were supposed to admire Hannibal Lecter for these qualities, but instead I found him repulsive, soulless, and deranged.",1350432000,7,1835,4.643076923076923

It still scares the wits out of me! But more importantly, it's a study in what drives serial killers and what their pathology is about. I am no movie critic but when a movie sticks in my psyche years after I see it, I conclude that it has content and a level of artistry that make it a classic.

154206,5,0792842111,"Clarice Starling (Jody Foster) is a star pupil at the FBI training academy when her mentor, Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) pulls her out of training to help assist on a case. Jack is the head of the Behavioral Science Unit of the FBI and he wants Clarice to interview Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) regarding a case about a serial killer. Hannibal is known as Hannibal the Cannibal for his horrific murders in which he practiced cannibalism on his victims.

Jack thinks that Hannibal, who is a psychiatrist, could help in solving a case involving a new serial killer called Buffalo Bill by using his insight into serial killers and psychiatry. Buffalo Bill kills women and skins parts of their bodies. Hannibal is angry that Jack sent a newbie young woman agent to try to entice him to talk. He won't help but when Clarice is leaving and is soiled by one of the other prisoners he agrees to help her. Hannibal's clues lead her to evidence of an old murder and to a possible link between Hannibal and Buffalo Bill. Hannibal's leads help the investigation but also turn into severe complications....

This movie is about the evil that men can do and of a young agent becoming exposed to the world of the criminally insane. Many scenes are macabre and horrifying so if you don't like those types of movies then you should consider if this movie is for you. It is truly a crime and horror classic movie and the acting is superb. The story line is very tightly done and directed expertly and the movie was a box office hit as well as the winner of multiple academy awards.

154208,5,0792842111,"Silence of the Lambs has a reputation for horrific violence, but the movie version is one that even the squeamish should be able to watch with only a few eye-coverings. Foster is a FBI trainee who is trying to help track down a serial killer. Hopkins is a captured killer who knows how these people think. Over time Foster is drawn to Hopkins, Hopkins subtly manipulates Foster, and the killer keeps doing his thing. Will Foster track the loose bad guy down in time?

I normally tend to shy away from gruesome movies - but I've seen Silence of the Lambs multiple times and adored it each time. It absolutely deserves its #65 ranking on the AFI top 100. The plot is fantastic and draws you in right from the very beginning. The actors are all fantastic. From Foster to Hopkins, from Levine to Glenn, you see their twist of motivations, their pulls and concerns, and how the relationships build.

Interwoven with the main plot are a variety of sub-themes. I love the scenes that examine the role of men and women in the police / FBI forces. They are handled very deftly. When Foster is presented, she's shown as a strong, athletically talented, intellectually gifted woman. And even so, the men around her look at her and see her beauty. The criminal she passes is crude in how he deals with her. Glenn is both a mentor and interested in her as a woman. The fellow male trainees all turn to watch her as she jogs past. When she and Glenn go to a crime scene, he ""protects"" her and draws the Sheriff to the side in order to discuss a sensitive topic. Foster is calm, deliberate, and points out the issue to Glenn. He acknowledges that she is right.

Out of all the movies in the AFI top 100, this is amazingly probably the best one in terms of female characters! With all the great movies on this list - Gone with the Wind, Annie Hall, Doctor Zhivago, that feature strong women, it's Silence of the Lambs that features some of the best women-to-women discussions in the entire list. In the vast majority of movies on the AFI list the women are solely there to play against men. They only ever talk with men. But here Foster has a sharp, wise African-American female friend who shares her insight into situations.

There are so many ways in which this movie shines. The plot is engaging and insightful. The actors are masters of their crafts. The tension in the scenes is masterfully handled.

Highly recommended.",1342656000,,2409,4.528735632183908

It's a powerful study of good vs evil told though the eyes of a young FBI trainee named Clarice Starling, our sympathetic heroine who is embodied by Jodie Foster heart and soul in the best performace of her career. She is called on by FBI Agent Jack Crawford to interrogate the brilliant psychopath Dr. Hannibal Lecter in hopes of gaining information on another serial killer, Buffalo Bill, one of Dr. Lecter's former patients. Anthony Hopkins is brilliant and terrifying in his role of the cannibalistic Dr. Lecter, and his relationship with Foster's Clarice Starling is one of the most interesting put on film of which I can think. Screenwriter Ted Tally does a masterful job of adapting Thomas Harris' novel and director Demme maintains a fever pitch atmosphere throughout. Foster and Hopkins are two of our best living actors, and they are at the top of their game here. Howard Shore's moody and atmospheric musical score compliments the film perfectly. The Silence of the Lambs is a masterpiece, thrilling and entertaining, and a film everyone should see at least once. A+",1340582400,,1197,4.930693069306931

154213,5,0792842111,"It's rare for a film to win Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay Oscars, but The Silence of the Lambs did just that. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins) is often regarded at the top villain in cinema history and he's probably the first character that springs to mind when you think about the movie. It's hard to believe that Hopkins was only on the screen for about 16 minutes.

The story begins with Agent Clarice Starling (Foster). We see her tackling an obstacle course at the FBI's Quantico training center. Her boss, Jack Crawford, (Glenn), calls her in and asks her to visit Lecter. He's in a secure cell and the warnings she receives appear excessive, but they seem justified by the end of the movie.

Lecter is intelligent, polite and eloquent. Although he's a monster capable of eating people, he has a twisted sense of honor. It's clear that he likes Starling and he rewards some of her honest revelations with help and insight into how she might track down serial killer, Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine).

It's curious that the movie is often placed in the horror genre. I watched David Fincher's version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo recently, and compared the two films. Both are essentially investigations into murders as the protagonists attempt to track a serial killer. Each includes a colorful character, although one is a hero and the other a villain. If Lisbeth Salander and Hannibal Lecter were more conventional characters, the two movies would lose a lot of their power. I think it's wrong to label The Silence of the Lambs as a horror movie, but I understand why that's often the case.

The movie works because we love how monstrous Lecter is and how human Starling can be. Foster's performance made Starling seem incredibly vulnerable. She's a young cadet finding her way in the FBI and this is her first big break. Then we see that she has to contend with Lecter, who is ruthlessly insightful and able to read her easily. Much of the story is seen from Starling's point of view and it's easy to identify with her fears as she tries to catch the killer.

The final showdown is extremely effective. You can sense the evil in Buffalo Bill and Starling's fear is audible and visible. The song playing during this sequence (Hip Priest, by The Fall) holds special meaning for me as it was played at the first concert I ever attended.

Scott Glenn can be very likable and I enjoyed his performance as Crawford. The movie drew considerable praise from the FBI for it's realism and it was easy to imagine Glenn as a member of the organization.

Hopkins is a versatile actor capable of playing just about any role. I would rank him among the top tier of my favorite actors. Maybe it's because of the characters he plays, but he strikes me as a very intelligent man.

The Silence of the Lambs is constructed simply, but the acting and the ominous mood elevate it to the level of greatness.",1332288000,2,2930,4.653771760154739

154228,2,0792842111,"Everything is here except for one thing: a believable psychopath, taken here in the form of Hannibal Lecter, an impossibly unrealistic antivillain that defies reality to the point where it's so distracting to be destructive.

Again, everything is here. The cinematography, writing, pacing, all of it's there. The only problem is the character of Hannibal Lecter, an apparently supernatural being who is not just a psychopath, but also a genius. But while I admit that some psychopaths are extremely intelligent, none can smell someone else from fifteen feet away and determine their perfume. Hannibal Lecter is so over-the-top, it's just awful. He's not at all a realistic psychopath, and is just a dramatic representation of what some of us might believe to be a psychopath. Instead, he's seen as having pretty much supernatural powers, which is just unforgivable here. The main antagonist is far more believable, although rather stupid, considering the ending in which he dies by his own stupidity.

Knowing psychopathy, I can't forgive this film's portrayal of Lecter, who is so far beyond the real psychopath that it's just comical, even funny at times. I genuinely smiled in amusement as he did things that no one could do, including psychopaths. It was awful. There's a reason no one like him exists: Because they don't. Psychopaths simply aren't capable of what Lecter does here, and it stretches the boundaries of what they can do too far to be enjoyable. Sure, I understand it's a movie, but movies have to stay in reality at least to a reasonable extent. This film doesn't do that. Lecter is beyond unbelievable, and an extremely poor example of even the most intelligent psychopath, particularly considering that he apparently has superhuman powers.

I had very high hopes for this film. I'm very sorry I was disappointed after picking up the Blu-ray. Lecter ruins it rather than makes it, but it's not Hopkins' fault, it's the writer's, who just doesn't care what he's writing about. Clearly, no research was done here, and everything was just made up for dramatic effect. For most of us, that's okay, but for those of us who are more educated to know what psychopathy is, it's just a killjoy.

Very disappointing because of Lecter's superhuman skills that make no sense whatsoever, and are not entertaining. Also major points off for the ending, in which you wonder you wonder how others were killed when hunted by the antagonist if he's so stupid as to do what he does at the end. It's extremely unsatisfying, and betrays horribly the methodical style of him. Just, awful.",1327795200,4,2586,4.979166666666667

Fortunately for me, I never bought this movie on VHS or DVD, so I REALLY didn't feel guilty for buying this fantastic movie for only $8.  Seriously, I've paid for more for far less inferior films.  Just the special features of this movie makes it worth it to buy.  It contains a lot of those ""while we make it, this is what we thought"" kind of documentaries.

I'm a bit weak when it comes to handling movies with gore, violence, and all of that, and of course I wouldn't be a fan of seeing these issues in real life...nobody would, hopefully, unless they're a lot like Buffalo Bill ;). But I thought the suspense buildup at various points of the movie were like no other. The actors, particularly Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins, played their parts well, despite what anyone might say against Foster's accent. And Hannibal was full of hair-raising tricks that justified the amount of heavy security placed near his cell.

Even if you don't like this movie that much, you would have to admit that it is a lot better than some of the more recent so-called ""thrillers"" that have been out in theaters. This one has realistic (albeit melancholy) situations, and isn't afraid to be a little bold in the topics covered.

I am not certain if this is due to more recent fare lifting ideas from the film, or if the film follows a typical by-the-numbers structure; surprisingly, this did not deter me from stopping the film. I was very much intrigued by Jodie Foster's performance. Like Dr. Lecter, I, too, wanted to know more about Clarice's background. I found Hopkins' performance tolerable; it was his constant snake-hissing that lent his character a cartoony feel and was thus difficult to take seriously at times. Overall, the film was entertaining. However, I would not revisit it or seek any greater meaning or subplot in it. Quick little note: has anyone noticed that the soundtrack consists of a track by the Fall and another by Colin Newman of Wire fame?

154249,5,0792842111,"I love ""The Silence of the Lambs."" It is one of my favorite movies. As one reviewer said, she enjoyed movies that (pull you in) so that you feel far, far away. I totally agree. ""Lambs"" stands head and shoulders above other horror movies because it is done with class and believability, unlike others that just feature repeated scenes of gore. I found ""Lambs"" to be spooky rather than unwatchably scary, because of these qualities. Jodie Foster's and Anthony Hopkin's acting are superb, getting inside Lecter's mind portrays the true, calculated nature of evil at its worst rather than just scenes of gore for shock value. The scene where he asks Miss Starling if she ever saved her lamb has such spiritual resonance i almost cried. Clarice is warned to not let Lecter get into her mind, and, in her fear and duty, deems the revealing of her thoughts necessary to the capturing of Buffalo Bill, with chilling results.

Other reviewers complained about Jodie Foster's ""forced"" southern accent. No, it was not indicative of Virginia where Clarice Starling had grown up during early childhood, and, while it sounds like she is imitating Reba McEntire, a southern accent is hard to imitate perfectly if one is not a native southerner (Foster is a native of L.A.), so give her a break. We can overlook this small, but cute error seeing as it is does not overshadow a brilliant storyline.

Everything is brilliant from beginning to end, from Clarice's revealing of her mind setting the stage to Hannibal's escape, to the very real threat of young women with kind personalities being the perfect target for rape and murder, to ultimately, evil being triumphed by good as our heroic rookie takes on Buffalo Bill, to the chilling cliffhanger of our escaped villain, Lecter.

1) Accent terribly uncomfortable from Clarice Starling (Foster).
2) Hopkins overacting: unwillingly, Hannibal Lecter, in various parts of the film takes shape too comical and ridiculous - the same thing happens with 'Buffalo Bill ""(one of the most mediocre serial killers of all time).
3) Buffalo Bill: concentrates a multitude of clichs. It is a very poor character.
4) The idea of the moth is too melodramatic, having its reflection in the ""transformation "" and ""maturity"" of Clarice ( la Disney World).
5) Characters totally unnecessary and incoherent with the atmosphere of the film (the colleague of Clarice at the Academy, the pair of ""funny"" biologists, for example).
6) Childish clichs regarding psychiatry and psychology.
7) Hannibal Lecter is a sort of superman: unlocks all mysteries, makes jests (""love your suit""...), gives a beating in the police (despite being locked up for eight years he maintened strong and muscled), deceives many doctors by placing a mask of flesh.
8) improbabilities: this is probably the biggest problem the film. There are many: a) Hannibal Lecter opens his handcuffs with a piece of pen b) Clarice Starling in 10 seconds, stirring a random object from one of the victims of ""Buffalo Bill"", founds revealing photos, c) Hannibal Lecter knows everything about everyone despite being locked in an underground hospital for some years, d) Hannibal Lecter kills a guy whispering (can someone explain this?)
9) The story of the murders becomes uninteresting throughout the film.
10) the end couldn't be worse.

It is marked the best in my mind for universally excellent acting (particularly Foster, Hopkins, and Ted Levine), a racing, suspenseful plot, thrilling elements of character you will have never seen coming, and an on-the-edge-of your seat feeling from the moment you first meet Dr. Hannibal Lecter to the moment the credits begin to roll.  I love being drawn into movies in such a way that real life seems far far away.  This is one of those movies.

Clarice Starling is a young, strong-willed FBI student assigned to interview the intriguing and frightening Hannibal Lecter.  Starling finds herself involved in hunting down Buffalo Bill (a killer nicknamed as such for the way he ""skins his humps"") with Lecter's help.  The mind games and conversations that go on between Starling and Lecter are absolutely my favorite parts of this movie.  So many times I thought I'd had a grip on the plot only to find myself totally thrown again and again.

""Silence of the Lambs"" is not only a truly wonderful movie in general, but in the subcategory of horror/suspense/thriller movies, it is perfect.  Suspense, a slight bit of gore to keep your heart pounding, remarkable and admirable characters, and just the right amount of disturbing chills placed tastefully throughout the whole thing combine to become my recipe for the ideal horror movie.

154290,5,0792842111,"Silence of the Lambs is a thriller that only others can aspire to.  Much darker and deeper than most, the stars carry their parts with exquisite, chilling moments from the beginning.  You are reeled in as the beautiful FBI Trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) meets the psychiatrist Hannibal Lechter - ""Hannibal the Cannibal"" (Anthony Hopkins).

The plot winds tight as Lechter is interviewed by Starling at his cell in a Maryland mental Hospital.  The give and take between them grabs your attention and from that point on you are emersed in the mind games and intelligent sparing for information between the two.  The FBI is hopeful that Lechter can go into the mind of a serial killer on the loose, ""Buffalo Bill.""  Lechter does, but only if Starling will give information about herself in exchange for insight and clues on the killer at large.  Buffalo Bill's current captive is a daughter of a senator and finding her is a riveting and breathless ending.  Through it all, Lechter is respectful of Agent Starling, and understands her own fears and dark secrets.  Oddly, through him she struggles out of her own sad, hidden issues.

Silence of the Lambs is both disturbing and yet transformational with the caterpillar turning into a beautiful moth or butterfly theme.  Clarice fights her fears and finds her own strength and courage through Lechter in a odd way.  The film is an unforgettable classic.

It is somewhat bluish, less saturated, and sometimes looks magenta. The Criterion edition has an overall warmer tone. The movie itself also does not seem to benefit all that much from the higher resolution transfer either. I don't know if it's the definition of the film or if the transfer wasn't well done.

The Blu-Ray is a disappointment because all the extras that were on the 2 disc collector's edition are NOT ported over as I've read in other reviews.  There is a 3 part interview solely with Demme and Foster which is not on the Blu-Ray.

A major reason to upgrade is picture quality AND the behind the scenes featurettes, and commentaries that most studios are actually taking time and care to produce.  There was nothing wrong with the collector's edition transfer.

Had I known before hand, and I do read and take note as to whether or not the Blu disc contains the same extras as the CE (hence my not bothering to purchase the Blu-Rays of classics like The Thing, and The Usual Suspects) I would not have made the purchase.

I'm sure that at some point in the near future complete versions of existing bare-bones Blu-Rays will appear with the collector's edition extras.

It was certainly one of the finest films I had ever seen on the big screen.

Now that I'm viewing this once again but on DVD, I can't help but feel that a lot is lost in viewing this film this way.  It made me realise that perhaps a Demme Director's cut version should be released which incorporates the deleted scenes which I thought were pretty good and that would help aid the story along as well.  The sound quality of this Fullscreen version is advertised as 5.1 Surround and is pretty good sound quality wise although the picture quality does look as if it could be improved upon and here's hoping a proper Blu-ray or standard format 20th anniversary edition will be released in a couple of years time in a director's cut version so as to add some freshness and life to this great film.  An anamorphic widescreen version would also be greatly appreciated.

A disturbing scene close to the end of the film where Buffalo Bill dances in drag fully nude; personally, I think the scene should never have made it into the final cut & II. As much as I enjoyed seeing Anthony Hopkins & Jodie Foster in their roles, I do not think this movie should have won Best Picture; Best Actor & Best Actress definitely, but NOT Best Picture.

Thus, ""Beauty And The Beast"" is the only animated movie ever nominated for Best Picture. (It's my all-time favourite movie, so I'm kinda biased). Worth seeing for Hopkins' & Foster's performances. Scott Glenn also does an excellent job. SPOILER WARNING: Also, definitely worth viewing for Lecter's escape from a prison in Memphis. SPOILER OVER!!

154328,5,0792842111,"Very rarely does a horror film find it's way into mainstream Hollywood. Most thrillers are big money makers, but much of the movie-going public would never admit to loving a horror film, or being ardent fans of the genre. None of this was true, however, for ""The Silence of the Lambs"". People to this day admit to loving the film and expressing the fact that it is one of their favorite motion pictures. Horror movies got a new respect after the release of ""Silence"", but many producers continued producing the garbage that we became accustomed to. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" was an original, unlike anything we have ever seen before.
 The film stars Jodie Foster, who's working as a student for the FBI, and gets an assignment with the Buffalo Bill Murders in the northeast, where women are being brutally killed. It is up to her to try to drain information from Hannibal Lecter, played brilliantly by Anthony Perkins, who is in captivity for being a murderer himself.
 The film is graphic, horrifying, but amazingly perfect. The script, acting, and the superb direction would all lead the film to sweep the Oscars in 1991, winning the top four major awards that year. It won acting accolades for its two stars, Jodie Foster and Anthony Perkins, and the movie won for direction, and rare for a horror film, it won Best Picture.
 The film transfer is impeccable, and the sound excellent. There are a ton of DVD extras, including interviews with the stars, trailers, and the packaging is one of the best I have seen for a movie release. A wonderful edition to any film library.
 The film would also spawn sequels like ""Hannibal"" and ""The Red Dragon"", as well as a prequel called ""Hannibal Rising"", depicting how Hannibal became a killer. If your a fan of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" pick up all 3 DVD's: they are wonderful pieces of cinematic work.
 Pick up the novel in which the movie is based on by Thomas Harris, also called ""Silence of the Lambs"". Don't read it alone though!",1240617600,,1978,4.656160458452722
154329,5,0792842111,"There are few perfect movies made in this world. Some movies work well with one group and some with another. But for the most part, movies are pretty much average to slightly above, enjoyed but forgotten or tossed aside for the next big thing. The perfect movie is rare indeed. When I try to think of one only two come to mind now. The first is THE GODFATHER, a film filled with great story, acting, directing, writing, and every tiny aspect of production that makes a perfect film. The second is the one I just finished watching: THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.

I know that I enjoyed this film when I first saw it back in 1991. I know that I thought it was a good movie and that everyone involved had done a great job. It has just been released in blu-ray format and that is what I watched. And to my surprise, after all these years, I found that not only was it a great movie, it was a perfect film.

For those who don't know. The story revolves around an FBI recruit named Clarice Starling (Jodi Foster) who has been called to the offices of Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), the head of Behavioral Sciences for the FBI. It seems that he's looked over her record and asks her help in a research project going on involving interviews with convicted and imprisoned serial killers. The man he wants her to interview is Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins).

Lecter is the worst of the worst when it comes to serial killers. A cold blooded and calculating murderer, he not only planned in advance the deaths of his victims, he made a point of eating various body parts, thus his nickname of Hannibal the Cannibal.

Secluded in a special prison cell in the basement of a home for the criminally insane, Lecter at first seems hesitant to answer any of Clarice's questions. But as their conversation progresses, he seems to ease up on his view of her. And eventually he offers to answer her questionnaire in return for her answering his questions as well. It's a mind game he plays as he plays mental chess with her.

Reporting back to Crawford, Clarice realizes that there was no real information for a study being asked of Lecter. She was used to get information from him that would help in the solving of a current case with a serial killer known as Buffalo Bill due to his skinning his victims. She was sent in blind so that Lecter wouldn't know what was going on. Now Crawford brings her in to help with the case.

As this story unfolds we are also privy to the tale of Buffalo Bill, a killer who has a movie for the skinning of his victims. It seems that he is trying to make a suit to wear made of the body parts of his victims. And he's taken a new captive that he is slowly starving while he waits for her skin to loosen up.

The daughter of a senator (Diane Baker), her mother pleads for her life on television. Interference with the FBI results when the egotistical head of the prison where Lecter is kept gives him information that he was used in return for help from Lecter to catch the killer. Lecter sets his own conditions and is transported to another state, a more open prison for the moment, in return for his assistance.

At this location, Clarice visits Lecter in the hopes that he will listen to her as she lets him know more about her. In return for her honesty, Lecter provides her with clues if she will only put the pieces together.

After Clarice leaves, Lecter attacks his guards in a well thought out plan, and escapes from the prison amid the tons of police officers surrounding the location.

Clarice follows Lecter's clues as do the rest of the FBI. But it is the particular clues he provided her that lead her to the home of Buffalo Bob. Whether or not she will realize this and if she can accomplish the feat of capturing another elusive criminal, all while being a cadet still, makes for the most climactic part of the movie.

This movie works on every level. It works as a tale of a young woman striving to make a name for herself in a world dominated by men. It works in the tale of a sympathetic homicidal maniac aiding her in her quest. It works as a police procedural story. And above all it works as pure entertainment. There is no time in this film when you feel compelled to look at the clock to see if it's almost over. You are transfixed in the tale going on before your eyes.

The film garnered enough attention to have a sequel and two prequels based on other books by the author, Thomas Harris. Interestingly enough, the character of Lecter had been used already in a film version of Harris' first novel featuring him, THE RED DRAGON, but filmed as MANHUNTER. But it was Hopkins portrayal that captured audiences enough that they kept coming back for more.

You may have seen this film when it came out. You may have watched it when it hit DVD shelves. But this is a movie to be watched over and over again, offering something new with each viewing. And in the blu-ray format you get to see it in pristine condition.

For fans of Hopkins this release also offers something you can use at home. A piece that can be used on your answering machine with Hopkins as Lecter giving the reply to phone callers.

So what makes this film a pefect picture? Everything. We have a story that captivates us and holds our attention, giving us clues along the way but not so much that we can figure everything out ahead of our heroine. We have superb acting as seen not only in the in your face Hopkins as Lecter but the subtle touches used by Foster as Clarice, an agent in training in over her head yet rising to the occasion.

The directing is Jonathan Demme at the top of his game, combining all the elements needed for a good film from pulling the performances from the actors to subtle musical scores that highlight what we are watching to editing the film with the right scenes in the right places to clothing that seems appropriate to each character involved.  He takes the reins here and holds them firmly, pulling out the best of everyone involved.

Not only do we get to watch the story unfold, we get to feel for each and every character. This even included Hannibal Lecter. What seems like a terrible monster offers glimpses of a refined soul at the center. He may not be someone you want to have dinner with (or be a part of) but he is an interesting killer as opposed to the brutal stalk and slash types. And Hopkins deserved praise here, not only for bringing the character to life but for reviving his own careerr in the process.

The look and feel of this movie captivates from the first moments until the last, which offers a funny twist from Lecter himself. Rarely is a viewer entertained from beginning to end, never looking to see what time it is or how much longer the film has to go. This is such a film. This film holds you in its grasp until the credits roll. And that is the true sign of a perfect film.",1240099200,,6845,4.384069400630914

I think that's a pretty good extra. In spite of it's limitations. the Criterion DVD A/V is close to the film. Ditto on the 2009 MGM BD plus a higher resolution.

Simply put, the quality of this blu ray is only slightly better than the transfer seen on the Criterion DVD release.  Also, the special features on the Criterion release are far more satisfying than what is presented here.

""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a great movie in almost every way.  The good news is that this is one of those titles that is not immune to massive double dipping.  Hopefully in the not too distant future this will be re-released on blu ray with a much richer transfer.

The image suffers from waxy skin tones, excessive DNR noise reduction, excessive sharpening, black crush in near black ranges of the image and generally mediocre tone and detail.

154353,4,0792842111,"This review will discuss the merits of the now rare and out of print Criterion Collection version of the film. One of the questions a viewer needs to ask him or herself is whether or not the added expense of a rare edition can be justified.

The Criterion dics presents the film in a letter boxed widescreen aspect ratio of 1.85:1 which appears to be the correct shooting format used by cinematographer Tak Fujimoto. The sound is standard 2.0 Dolby Surround. This is a fairly new film and the Criterion transfer appears to be reference quality. I have heard that there is an inexpensive collector's edition by MGM that presents the transfer as a widescreen anamorphic with a 5.1 surround mix. For pure picture quality either way you go is probably fine.

There is really no reason to discuss the plotting of the film. It is well recognized that the acting by Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins as the two leads is amazing. Both went on to win Academy Awards for their work. The Ted Talley screenplay was also give the Oscar for iis adaptation of the Thomas Harris source material.

The biggest feature of the Criterion Edition is a commentary track featuring director Jonathan Demme, actors Foster and Hopkins, screenwriter Talley and FBI agent John Douglas. As far as I can tell this is the only edition that offers a commentary track. The track is informative and is a good listen. The Criterion Disc features seven deleted scenes taken from a workprint (timecode is included). Most of these scenes are unnecessary but two reveal a dropped plotline that is rather interesting. The rest of the film extras include storyboard galleries and a storyboard to film comparison of the Memphis jail break.

Two rather interesting features are pure textual. There is a lengthy series of excerpts from the FBI Field Classification Manual on Sexual Homicide prepared by John Douglas ans a feature called Voices of Death which is a series of quotes by convicted seriel killers prepared by Michael Newsom from his book. All in all these features  compose a great deal of material on the criminal mind and should not be skipped.

The Criterion Disc is well suited to fans of the film or to those with an interest in the subject matter. It is also well worth seeking out for the Criterion completist.",1226966400,,2284,4.769620253164557
154374,1,0792842111,"I cannot believe that Yahoo users have voted this movie as the No. 1 horror movie of all time and I wonder how after all these years many people are still lauding this movie. Maybe 5 or 10 minutes into the movie where they pull out the insect from the mouth of a corpse and I realised I was going to watch one of the most ridiculous movies ever and it sure lived up to that reputation.

How many of the detectives out there in real life searching for serial killers (many of them who are still at large) are visiting disillusioned and demented psychopaths rotting in prison cells for advice on how to nab them? That is what this movie is all about. I really want to know how many students, teachers of psychology thought about the whole meeting a psychopath to get clues to the whereabouts of a serial killer thing. I particularly wanted their opinions on the conversations the two had. Particularly that incredible line this movie is famous for when Jodie says ""He said he could smell my c**t."" Maybe they were laughing at it all. Actually after I heard this line all I wanted to do was run out of the cinema but stayed back just to watch the remaining garbage. Jodie is a very talented actress and Anthony Hopkins one of the very best there is but I wonder what was going on in her mind as she said that obnoxious line in the movie. Don't tell me it was for the Oscar. Oh God! then please, please give it to her. Yeah, that's what they did. Besides that line the sessions between Jodie and Hannibal are preposterous filled with questions and answers that have no relation to the questions.

In the unnecessarily prolonged climax scene where Jodie kills the killer (who is wearing night vision glasses) in total darkness was just outrageously ridiculous. Was it for this that Jodie went to consult the psychopath and speak that horrible line?

But the way this movie generated a great-movie fervor and zeal is probably a success story for marketing.  The super cast (Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster), the attractive movie poster and all the hype lead it all the way up to the Oscars where it netted the coveted ones, Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Director and Best Picture.

Both Anthony Hopkins and Jodie won oscars for their roles but if you really want to see their true potential check out The Bounty for Anthony Hopkins and Contact, Flight Plan for Jodie to just name a few of the many good movies where Jodie and Anthony had more meaningful and purposeful roles.

154377,5,0792842111,"Anthony Hopkins' Oscar-winning performance has made Hannibal Lecter one of the 3 most famous horror character icons born during The Age of Cinema.  The other 2 of course (in no particular order) are Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates and Robert Englund as Freddie Krueger.  Of course, I excluded characters invented before movies were invented, such as Dracula, Frankenstein, etc.  But, Hopkins' portrayal of the brilliant shrink who has a taste for cannibalism is nothing short of exquisite.  Just a casual conversation with Lecter sends a chill up your spine.  Someone else portrayed the character in an earlier movie, but no one noticed.  Hopkins perfected the role and made it his own.  Jodie Foster also won an Oscar for her role as Clarice Starling, the FBI trainee who is sent to question Dr. Lecter in his underground cell in a mental institution for the criminally insane.  She wants Lecter to help profile and maybe identify a serial killer who has been skinning young girls after killing them.  The killer known as Buffalo Bill is also admirably portrayed by Ted Levine. (my title for this review is one of Buffalo Bill's famous lines from this film)  There is not a lot of blood, violence or gross stuff shown in this flick.  There's a little, but not much.  This isn't supposed to be a slasher flick, but rather a psychological thriller that gets its bone-chilling effectiveness from the script, the actors and the suspense which is beautifully created by the patient director, Jonathan Demme.  Effects such as close-up conversations with Lecter speaking right to the camera (as if the audience has Clarice's close-up view while speaking to him) helps with the spooky atmosphere of the film.  I was never a huge Jodie F. fan, but she definitely deserved her Oscar in this film for her role as, the bravely-trying-to-hide-her-fear-and-do-her-job, smart and professional in the grim face of danger Clarice.  Supurb script, acting and directing make for a suspenseful, spooky psychological thriller without much blood or grotesque imagery...again there is a little, but not too much.  I'll admit I like blood and carnage and slasher flicks.  But, I can greatly admire a film that can be spooky without going that route...especially a movie that is as finely crafted as this one.  This movie is excellent at maintaining the spooky mood while building tension and suspense.  It keeps you rivoted.  Believe me, if you miss this movie, you'll eat your heart out.

154397,5,0792842111,"`The Silence of the Lambs' is one of the most widely known and lauded films in recent years.  I say recent years because it's a 90's child and usually a film has to be 20+ years old before people start throwing the word classic around.  `The Silence of the Lambs' is, though, a classic.  It's that rare breed of film that elicits fear and dread as well as admiration, for the audience knows exactly what they are meant to feel and they embrace it wholeheartedly.

`The Silence of the Lambs' revolves around a relationship between FBI trainee Clarice Starling and serial killer Hannibal `the cannibal' Lecter.  The fact that Clarice is looking for another serial killer still at large is really beside the point.  This movie is about Clarice and Hannibal, about their growing trust and their deep-seated emotional response to one another.  Hannibal is a horrifying man, a man who eats other humans, but Clarice is drawn to him in a way she cannot explain.  You can see this in her eyes, in the way she communicates with mere glances in his direction.  Clarice is scared and vulnerable and trying her hardest to prove herself in a field she feels less that comfortable with, but Hannibal sees something in her that excites him.  He sees a way that he can help her help herself and so he attacks her self esteem and her confidence, not in a malicious manner but in an attempt to better her.

The fact does remain though that Clarice is using Hannibal.  She needs to find the killer Buffalo Bill; a man who kidnaps women, keeping them locked away for days while they moisturize their skin until he kills and skins them and then dumps their bodies.  He has just kidnapped yet another victim and so the clock is ticking for Clarice to unlock Hannibal's secrets in order to save a life.

I have never been a fan of Jodie Foster.  I felt that she was effective in `The Accused' but aside from that she has never really bolstered in me a growing curiosity.  Same can be said for her performance here, which is just not as impressive to me as many make it out to be.  I don't think she should have won the Oscar, both Susan Sarandon and especially Geena Davis was better suited for Oscar gold.  Her performance though, is not bad, and so I can't downgrade it too much.  It sells what it needs to sell, but it just wasn't Oscar-worthy in my humble opinion.  Anthony Hopkins is another story all together.  His performance was iconic, practically flawless.  The ticks that he associated to Lecter are just mesmerizing, the way he sucks in his words when he speaks to emphasize the corruption surrounding his superior intellect is astounding in every way.

Jonathan Demme brilliantly created a film that gets under your skin and stays in your head.  It's gritty and raw and takes your breath away scene after scene.  There isn't really a film in this genre that can compare.  As a horror film goes it succeeds in sending shivers down the spine.  As a psychological thriller is succeeds in molesting the demons in your head and as a drama is succeeds in creating an atmosphere of the purest form and delivering satisfaction all around the table.  There are few films that reach the emotional as well as physical depth of `The Silence of the Lambs', a film that truly deserves the unbridled commendation.",1199318400,,3289,4.595197255574614

154400,5,0792842111,"While I say this is the best thriller of all time, this is one of the best movies of all time.  In addition, it contains the greatest villain in cinematic history - Dr. Hannibal Lectar - played by Anthony Hopkins who gives as oscar-winning performance (easily his most memorable of his career).  Add an oscar-winning performance by Jodie Foster as the investigator in training ""Clarice Starling"" and a great supporting cast, incredible story, and just the right amount of gore and creepiness and you get just about a perfect movie that can easily entertain anyone who loves movies.

If you have never seen this movie, you don't know what you are missing out on.  Maybe its the disturbing imagery that has kept you away, or the sickening themes attached to the villains, but in reality its kind of mild compared to movies today such as Saw and Hostel.  Unlike Saw & Hostel, Silence of The Lambs is a classic, that shows just the right amount of disturbing imagery and sickness to fill the balance of the movie.  There is no overload, for the movie's finest achievemnt is told within its superb story, and not through its R rating.  The film has many layers of story being told, and its kind of three dimensional.

There are two villains in the story.  The first is Buffalo Bill, who everyone is attempting to capture.  He's kind of the villain on the surface of the film, but the real person to admire is Hannibal Lecter.  He is behind bars in the start of the film, but he is a very deep and complex person, and unlike any villain you've seen before.  He eats the rude and loves to search deep into your mind, as he does with the young Clarice who he develops a unqiue likeness to.  As for Bill, Hannibal knows a great deal about him, and is the only source Clarice can find for information, but not before Hannibal dives into he mind and forces her to recall her troubling past and apply it to her present situation.  It is a very deep connection the two share, that both actors share a wonderful and unique chemistry for.  Truly the best thing about this film and adds real depth to the story.

In favor of a terrific and suspenseful film, I will not give away any more details about the story or Buffalo Bill.  It is also a great mystery and puzzle-solver, attempting to locate this villain who has committed crimes that, well, you just have to see for youself - though a bit disgusting.  Silence of The Lambs is a must own to complete a great home movie collection.  It is one of the most memorable movies of all time, that creepy enough, will probably stick with you for the rest of your life.

Scariest scene in the whole movie:  I can remember sitting in the theater the weekend this came out at the movies and during the scene when they're rushing Hannibal Lector's ""victim"" to the hospital in the ambulance and screaming ""oh my God!"" out loud when he sits up on the stretcher!

Add to that a great transfer by Criterion (I prefer this one to the MGM version, only because I like it a little darker - but the MGM edition's good, too), and you've got a great DVD.

It's about as good as book adaptations get - period. Having read the book before I saw the movie, there's only one part in the book (when she's on the shooting obstacle course) I wish they'd included in the movie that would have helped pay off Starling's character flaws a bit more, but the story still works just great as is, so no sense belaboring that bit. It wasn't there and if you've never read the book, you'll still get it.

I actually read the book first, was fascinated by it, and couldn't wait for the film to come out. That was the day I picked to quit smoking and I knew this movie would take my mind off that matter. I was expecting an intense movie and I got it. Little did I realize how well-received this film would be and how it propelled Anthony Hopkins to super-stardom.  Today, after a half-dozen viewings, I still find it fascinating.

This movie is not for the squeamish and there is some extreme crudeness in the story but I suspect everyone knows that by now. What I've always liked best was the by-play between ""Dr. Lecter"" and ""Clarice."" The looks on Hopkins' face, his fascinating vocabulary with intelligent sarcasm and frankness, never ceases to entertain.

Yet,on repeated viewing,it is the Jodie Foster role as Clarice that is far more interesting. She manages to convey a vulnerability and strength that are a match for the predatory Dr Lector (aka Lecter). Their relationship is one of allure based on intellect. The intellectual marriage is somehow more profoundly sexual in its intimacy,mating of two superior brains and power of revelation (on Jodie's part) that both contrasts  and fuses with the impenetrable mystery of this interesting/good professor and mentor/party animal/wild killer/savage obscentiy named Hannibal,which we can never ever hope to understand, and never want to,really. No, the latest book (Hannibal Rising) can't even come close to explaining away this enigmatic fellow. Nor should it. Evil ought to remain mysterious.

for the movie he was in..A HORROR)The Academy has gave out a handful
of statues since the first ceremony in 1927..Some I can think of are
Oscar winners like The Exorcist winner for best sound(oh! ""whoopee"")
The Omen and Jaws for best score and Piper Laurie with Sissy Spacek carrie
were nominated...O.K. What about Anthony Perkins for PSYCHO(no nomination?
????????????????) Jaws for best picture 75(lost to the STING..The Sting
is good..but c'mon!!!!!!) and we can go on and on Kubrick's Shining
NOTHING! So I knew in my heart Silence too was to get nothing,but
lo and behold..IT WON! I was so happy I jumped up and down and
held (I can still remember)holding my Dracula(1931) and JAWS VHS

Foster is note-perfect as Starling, a driven but inexperienced operative struggling mightily not to appear both terrified and out of her depth. And Hopkins's seething, malevolent Lecter makes the knife-wielding Norman Bates in ""Psycho"" look like a boy scout. Ted Levine is also suitably deranged and bizarre as Buffalo Bill, adding further to the goose bump count. One of the more potent shockers out there, ""Silence"" is not for the squeamish, but those who can take it will love it.

154432,5,0792842111,"The only film that can be dubbed a ""horror film"" to win the Oscar for Best Picture, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a film that has and continues to stand the test of time. #65 on The American Film Institute's Top 100, it's also one of the few films on that list to actually make the average film critic's top 100 as well. The film stars Jodie Foster in her 2nd Oscar-winning role as Clarice Starling, a fledgling FBI agent assigned by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a former psychiatrist doing time in a maximum security facility. There's a serial killer on the loose dubbed Buffalo Bill, who has been kidnapping innocent young women and taking portions of their skin. People often mention that this movie and its book are based on the legendary serial killer Ed Gein. It's not, but that aspect of the story is. As Clarice begins interviewing Lecter, she finds herself drawn further into the case and finds herself forming a sort-of friendship with Dr. Lecter. Now, this is a film that is much like ""The Godfather"" in the fact that it's been parodied endlessly (""Joe Dirt"" and ""Family Guy"" have recently parodied this film), yet when we actually see the legendary scenes of the film we don't start laughing. Most people who haven't seen this film can still recite the lines ""It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again."" This movie is not just filled with legendary portions of dialogue, but also legendary scenes. Notably, the introduction of Dr. Hannibal Lecter. This scene is simple, yet unforgettable. Clarice is walking down a hallway, to the final cell at the end. When Lecter is revealed, he is merely standing in his cell completely erect waiting for Starling. It's this kind of body language (among other things) that won Anthony Hopkins the Oscar. Few other actors have created characters that have had so much effect on our society (other examples would be Marlon Brando and Al Pacino). Ask someone to identify a line of dialogue from this film and it will either be the line I listed above or ""I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti."" This is a film in which Hopkins proved (much like Pacino did in ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and John Malkovich did in ""Of Mice & Men"") what a complete actor he is. In a lot of films you watch, you see an actor and think, ""there's [insert name here]."" When Lecter first appears, my thoughts were ""there's Hannibal Lecter."" Foster is also effective as Starling, considering she's in damn near every scene of the film. She's also the moral center of the film, as well as the protagonist. Hollywood is nervous about giving a woman the lead role, especially in a role that requires the woman to be both vulnerable and strong-willed at the same time. Foster does both and makes it completely believable. Ted Levine is one of the only actors who could've played Buffalo Bill (the only other actor I can think of that could have pulled off the role is John Malkovich). It's the voice mostly. Much like the line ""I coulda been a contender"" probably wouldn't have been much had it not been Brando who recited it. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a perfect film, at least of it's genre. The reason it has stood the test of time is for the same reason movies like ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Casablanca"" have. Like those movies, every scene is absolutely necessary for the film to function as a whole. Howard Hawks once defined a great movie as ""three great scenes and no bad scenes."" ""The Silence of the Lambs"" has more than three great scenes, several legendary ones, and no bad scenes. After 16 years, more people still see this than they do its sequel and prequel ""Hannibal"" and ""Red Dragon."" I'm sure in 16 more years, it will still be seen more than those two films and it's recent 2nd prequel ""Hannibal Rising.""

154463,5,0792842111,"The Movie

Nevermind the pop culture boogie man the character became. The only superb film in the series was the first good horror/thriller in decades. It did this not by shedding the humanity of it's characters, but drenching them in it. The streamlined script (relying on exposition by showing memory in action rather than the usual talking head, for example, Clarices memories of her father), the superior direction and inventive cinematography steeped the film in tragedy, doom and suspense. The casting was perfect. All surrounded by institutional squalor and the flipside of the american dream.

The Disc

Finally we get the extras we deserve. I already have the Criterion Edition with it's interesting commentary track and more key players than you can shake a script at...well, all of them actually. Too bad they couldn't have combined the two discs for those who don't have the Criterion.

It is a tribute to this film that all the sequels and prequels have done well inspite of a less then spectacular treatment of the authors writen word. (Don't get me started on the ending of the Movie ""Hannibal""!

  I own the original DVD of SOL and the Criterian editon and because of the added extras listed on the sales page I decided to purchase this two disk package. I have to say I enjoyed the new Two Disk package very much but can not really say if it is worth the purchase if you are like me and own any of the earlier multi feature packages.

  The feature on the making of the film that show the building of the feature and it's inpact durring it's initial release was very interesting.  It shows how unique a film it was and how it's very disturbing story caused such a stur even at Oscar time. I had almost forgoten that.

  There is a very interesting ""From Page to Screen"" piece that I always find enjoyable.  These featurettes are always literate and well constructed.

  One aspect of the this set I truly loved was the Anthony Hopkins phone message in Character you can transfer to your message machine.  I was so there for that. ( I need Help. HeHe)

  As far as the transfer quality it is a fine letterbox quality rendering and It is almost theatre like if you have a Hi-Def televison and I urge all who have the Dash for such a purchase to make it. It takes the viewing experiance to the next level.

  In the end It is a very good package and I do not feel I was swindled by making the choice of buying it.  I don't think alot of new ground was covered from the other special additons but the small diffeances were enough for me.",1174176000,3,1817,4.245614035087719

I have seen every DVD release of this film, though sadly I wasn't old enough to see it when  it first came out. Nevertheless, MGM and 20th Century Fox have really outdone themselves:

1. Criterion

The Criterion Collection has always been a trusted source of films for me, and their initial release of this film was decent but lacking with special features, plus the video quality was somewhat scratchy. Still, couldn't beat that commentary track.

2. 2001 MGM

The MGM Speical Edition was pretty nice to promote the theatrical release of Hannibal, with a slew of documentaries and interviews that gave a lot of information of the Silence. No commentary track, but a nice new 5.1 surround mix and a much needed clean-up of the faded picture made the greens rich and the reds blood red.

3. 2007 MGM/20th Century Fox

This new 2-disc set offers the same anamorphic 1.85:1 transfer as was the 2001 release and it still has all of the same documentaries, but this release adds some more features that give even more information about how the film was made and the contoversy afterward. That, and the package art is absolutely delicious. Speaking of which, just behind the inside cover booklet is a tasty treat that invokes both sick humor and helpful tips about ""cooking""

Bottom line, if you've never seen this film before then I highly recommend it...that is if you have a strong stomach. It's a brilliant story about good and evil and how dark some people can really be. If you already have all of the previous releases, check this one out too, it's worth the double-dipping into your wallet. The best reason to get this are the added bonus features, but if you really love this film like I do then you'll find it's a great addition to your DVD library.",1170374400,128,1902,4.636904761904762

After reading so much about this film, I just had to see what all the fuss was about. It did, after all, sweep the Oscars. Why not?

The verdict: it has become one of my favorite movies.

The acting is phenomenal. The direction is perfect. Scripting, wonderful. Everything, perfect. It is not often one comes across a ""perfect"" film. The so-called horror aspects of the film are so cleverly devised that I was not left scared but rather amazed at the sheer genius of the way each situation was concocted.

Anthony Hopkins is an inspiration. When given good dialogue, as he is here, he sparkles on the screen and pulls it off with such simplicity that you're left wondering if the old guy isn't playing you for a fool. He doesn't even seem conscious of his delivery style, he melts into Lecter so seamlessly that that is the scariest aspect of the film.

It is clear in particularly the scene where he escapes from his cell and has a small feast, in the form of one of his jailors face, before he actually gets away.

154527,4,0792842111,"If you collect Criterion dvds, especially out of print ones, you will definitely want this. If you are a fan of the film only and not a criterion collector here are some thoughts to consider.

The image in this seems slightly more saturated than the MGM dvd, with some oddly colored skin tones. Not to mention that the bitrates of the two dvds are near identical, meaning they are roughly the same image quality.

The real kicker is this, the criterion is not in anamorphic widescreen and the MGM dvd is.

However the Crime manuals and serial killer statements are very interesting special features on the Criterion.

(my rating of this dvd is four stars for the sad lack of anamorphic widescreen)

It is no wonder why he and Jodie Foster are both Oscar winners, for she gives an outstanding performance as Clarice Starling. Winner of 5 Academy Awards, this movie will always remain a true classic in every way. Hopkins is mezmorizing in his role. A non stop thriller with twists and turns that keep you glued to this movie.

Harris's novel about  brilliant, pathological, cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) who is interviewed by FBI agent-in-training Clarice Starling (Jodi Foster) in an attempt to find information about another serial killer currently terrorizing a multi-state region.  The critics obviously agreed, as this was the third movie in history to sweep all five of the top Oscar categories.  The true brilliance of the film lies in its ability to chill the viewer without the use of gore or special effects.  Hearing Dr. Lecter say, ""Clarice"" will always send chills up my spine.  His demand to get information about Clarice's personal history, in exchange for his help in the serial killer hunt, makes Dr. Lecter all the scarier as a villian.  He has some unforgettable lines in the movie (and Anthony Hopkins only required a mere cumulative 16 minutes of screen time to earn his Best Actor award for this role).  The viewer can't help but ask themselves why we (and Clarice) are all attracted to this charming man who eats people for fun.

This movie has a well-deserved place in history, and it chills the viewer well, even a decade after its original release.",1140393600,,1253,5.078048780487805

Silence of the movie is very different from it all, it is a psycho movie with great actors and great direction which will send chills down your spine with just a few words and some good background music.

Hannibal Lecter: Tell me, Clarice - have the lambs stopped screaming?

The words don't mean anything by itself, but in the voice of Hannibal Lector, it is a scary scene.

154565,5,0792842111,"For years, my parents had banished me from watching ""The Silence Of The Lambs"", saying it was ""too scary"". However, I had begged my parents to let me watch it. So, I put it on my Christmas list, and low and behold, it was sitting under my Christmas tree on December 25th. However, I did not watch it until today.

A serial killer known as Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) is kidnapping women across the Midwest and murdering them by skinning them alive. Baffled by these disturbing turn of events, the FBI sends trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) to interview a prisoner who could give anwers to the killer's motivations. That prisoner is Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a cannibal who is also a brilliant pyschologist who knows everything about the criminal mind. He agrees to help Clarice, but only if she divulges to him the dark details of her own life. But when Bill kidnaps the daughter of a renowned Memphis senator, Clarice cannot play this game any longer, for time is running out. This leads to a startling climax that will stay with you forever.

""The Silence Of The Lambs"" truly deserves the praise that is heaped upon it. It is one of if not the best suspense thrillers ever made. This film is so disturbing that one wonders if all this really happened (indeed, Buffalo Bill was actually an amalgam of several different real life serial killers).

The acting is superb. Jodie Foster is brilliant as Clarice. She portrays this tough, courageous and fearful women like no one else can and she truly deserved the Best Actres Oscar. Ted Levine is so creepy that it actually makes you sick. Why he was not awarded is something I've pondered. Scott Glenn adds ample support in the lesser role of Clarice's boss, Jack Crawford. However, throughout, the whole film, our focus remains on Hopkins. As Lecter, Hopkins creates one of the single greatest performances in film history. You wait in anticipation for what he's going to say or do next. You are drawn into the mind of this man. One could never imagine that a man who eats people could be so likeable.

the extra features I haven't watched yet, but they look great. Still, you should definitely watch the film first. It's worth it, trust me.",1135814400,,2203,4.699481865284974

The soft spoken and superficial politeness of the Hannibal Lechter character make him all the more terrifying. Hopkins' ability to project madness in his quiet understated way was brilliant (aided by the directors tight closeups of his glowering face) Jodie Foster, talented and beautiful as always was the perfect foil.

The tension built throughout the film, and I didn't find one boring moment.

The reason for thelocation of the final scene on some third world Caribbean Island (Bimini I believe) wasn't clear, but the comment about having an old acqaintance for dinner was darkly comic and provided some release from the tension that had built up. And of course, left the door open for a sequel.

154567,5,0792842111,"This is one of the best films I have ever seen.  Clarice draws the viewer in with sympathy that you feel with a young, beautiful and ambitious youth.  She is going to make a career and will let nothing stand in her way.  She has a mentor as an aspiring FBI specialist in behavioral crimes but most of all guts.

Then she gets drawn into the mind of a serial killer, Lecter, who is as perceptive as he is monstrous.  It is here, while investigating the crime and his mind, that she exposes some of the psychological roots of her passion to succeed in law enforcement.  This is beautifully done and completely believable. Lecture is so scary and strange, acted as brilliantly as Clarice, such as in his crude ""interrogation"" of the Senator.

Behind this, there are manipulations going on as Clarice makes some startling (and career-enhancing) discoveries.  Of course, there is a suspenseful ending and some graphic violence as well as a bunch of surprises.  It is a true masterpiece of detail and plot and theme.

154568,4,0792842111,"Silence of the Lambs has at its heart a strange relationship between two fascinating characters.  There's Clarice Starling, who is vulnerable and inexperienced, but also clever, strong-willed and courageous.  And then there's Hannibal Lecter, the brilliant, elegant, and witty ex-psychiatrist who is also a cannibal.  They don't have many scenes together, but when they are both on screen the movie hums with tension, as Lecter tries to delve into Starling's mind, and she doggedly attempts to get information from him that will help the FBI catch an utterly twisted serial killer on the loose.

Anthony Hopkins delivers a performance that will at once make you shiver and laugh.  He embodies a figure who is elegant, depraved, and fascinating; his role as Lecter is legendary.  Jodie Foster's performance is also wonderful - tenacious, honest, brave even as she visibly copes with fear.  Together, the actors achieve a strange chemistry as they play mind games with one another...  Lecter wishing to learn a piece of personal information about Clarice for each piece of information he chooses to share about the serial killer.

The serial killer, Buffalo Bill, is a crude character, horrible and disgusting but not intriguing.  He is not nearly as interesting to watch as Lecter, though he is downright twisted in how he captures, keeps, and dispenses with his victims.  Also, aside from the Lecter-Starling interactions, the most involving sequence of events in the movie involves Starling's confrontation with the serial killer.

The DVD has some interesting extra content, including deleted scenes, a making-of featurette with interviews, and a few surprisingly funny outtakes (actually, I wish the DVD had included more of those).  Silence of the Lambs is wonderful in that it rises above gore; it is an intense psychological thriller, disturbing on levels that go beyond physical revulsion at the sight of skinned bodies and decapitated heads.  The minor characters are sharply drawn, while Lecter and Starling are compelling and complex.",1132704000,,2044,5.307453416149069
154569,5,0792842111,"You will never get over this movie no matter how hard you try.  Something about it will haunt you forever and make you very afraid of the world.  It spawned a million copycat books and films which couldn't hold a candle to it.  It lead Anthony Hopkins to a profitable career which lead him to star in about 25 films per year in every genre possible.  It did everything short of having the enrollment at Quantaco jump 400% and inspire a haircut called ""The Jodie"".  But this was a phenomenal movie.

Jodie Foster plays Clarise, an FBI trainee who is assigned by the head of Behavioral Science to study an asylum patient by name of Dr. Hannibal Lecter.  This odd errand has an ulterior motive, as the FBI is curious to know if he knows anything about a serial killer who has been looming around the Midwest known only as Buffalo Bill.  Once a senator's daughter, Catherine Martin, is kidnapped by Buffalo Bill, Clarise and the FBI descend on Dr. Lecter as their only possible resource, anxiously seeking information.  Lecter is a monster, a completely evil, horrible monster, who loves the attention he's getting and to keep Clarise coming back he talks in riddles at all times.  ""All that you need to know is right here in these pages of the case file, Clarise.""  And in perhaps the best editing and split scene in the history of film, the FBI goes to the wrong house and Clarise goes to the right one to find herself face to face with Buffalo Bill.  Here she slays the dragon, rescues the damsel in distress, and conquers evil.

There are so many layers to this movie it's hard to know where to start.  It is the most terrifying movie ever, the horror of knowing that there are people like Buffalo Bill in the world as well as Dr. Lecter.  The fact that the lead is a woman gives it a twist, as we see Clarise living in a man's world, braving the elements, but at the same time she is more vulnerable to fear and harm.  Trying so hard, brave little Clarise goes into the monster's cave to meet the most terrible creatures that even the bravest of men can't face.  I admired that about her, that she is really scared to death but she is able to pull it all from within to overcome not just her fears but to triumph over evil.

The relationship between her and Dr. Lecter is probably what scares but fascinates us the most.  He clearly likes her, and keeps her coming back because he wants the attention and to be with her more.  Clarise knows the only way to get to Buffalo Bill is to probe Dr. Lecter, so she is forced to not just return to him but appease his evil by sharing her nightmare from childhood about the lambs being slaughtered on the farm she was sent to after her father's death.  And Dr. Lecter loves it, getting into her haunted past to see what he can use, plus feeling that they have a bond or a trust when he has none with anyone.

Some criticism?  The only criticism I can think to point out is the Buffalo Bill history.  We all want to know how and why someone is the way they are, especially someone like him.  It was hinted upon when Dr. Lecter said that he was not born a killer but made into one through years of systematic abuse.  We wanted to know what it was, but because of time constrains and story it was avoided.  Read the book and you'll get the full picture.

Here it is 15 years later, and I think I still wake up at night hearing that aweful screaming of the lambs ...",1132272000,,3404,4.309748427672956

Anthony Hopkins won his Oscar for a little over 16 minutes of screen time, making him the only actor to win the big prize with the shortest screen time.  However, his performance is so mesmerizing and chilling he is unforgettable.  Scott Glenn offers fine support as Jack Crawford, Foster's boss whose respect and subtle admiration for her character spearheads her chase.

The very fact that this film is as popular as it is reflects pretty poorly on the American viewing public.  I sat through about 15 minutes of this film before I wanted to turn it off.  The scene that almost did me in at that point was the conversation between Jody Foster's character and her boss: ""Be careful; you don't want this guy crawling around inside your head,"" as if Anthony Hopkin's psychotic shrink-turned-monster had some superhuman power to control a person, even someone as alert and educated as a federal investigator.  Give me a break!  The movie sadly got no better as it continued.  I can suspend belief for a film as readily as the next person, but I expect the filmmaker to meet me halfway and at least present some reasonably believable material.  It is clear that the writer/director did not consult any professionals in the fields dealt with in making this piece of cinematic trash.

I am at a loss to explain the huge number of favorable reviews.  There was no tension in viewing the film at all, and the conclusion was so foregone that a child would have seen it coming a mile away.  What a waste.

But so long as the general viewing public thinks that making such lowbrow, uninformed slop is acceptable, this kind of thing is all Hollywood will ever turn out.  That's a shame.",1128384000,11,1436,4.5408560311284045
154593,5,0792842111,"This is one of my favorite films. Jonathan Demme did a brilliant job with this film. He tied all the elements of a good script and made it into a great film.  The acting by Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins is outstanding and they were perfectly cast. This is not your typical horror movie but a mix of pyschological terror and drama.  Jodie Foster plays the role of a young and determined Clarice Sterling  who is training to be an FBI agent.  Her boss gets her interested in a case which seems might fit her persona and may help her in the long run.  The case involves a psychopath they call Buffallo Bill (played by Ted Levine) who skins large woman. She takes the case and this is where we first get introduced to Dr. Hannibal Lector ( Anthony Hopkins) a renowned psychiatrist who went mad.  He is locked up in a maximum prison facilty in Maryland for the criminally insane.  Buffalo Bill was one of his patients and Clarice needs to slowly unravale the mystery behind the skinings, why they are happening, and help provide the FBI with a psycological profile of the killer. In order for her to do so she needs Dr. Lectors help.

Hannibal agrees to help but in the process he ""toys"" with  Clarices feelings and brings back her tortured past when she was a little girl. In order for Clarice to capture Buffalo Bill she must eventually confide in him, which she does.  Clarice tells Hannibal what happened to her  when she was young and how it effected her. Hannibal slowly gives out more clues about the killer. Clarice takes the information and investigates each of them thoroughly. You can tell how dedicated she is from this case from the beginning of the movie and throughout. I like how they made her female character so strong. Soon Clarice finds herself in a race against time because the killer has struck again and kidnapped a senators daughter.  Clarice asks Dr. Lector for the identification of this pyscopath in order to save the young girls life. In exchange for this information we are lead to believe that Dr. Lector will be transferred to a less maximum security prison where he can be more ""free"". This is when the movie gets really intense. Clarice is brilliant by putting the pieces of the puzzle slowly together. I don't want to give too much away. This is not for the weakhearted as there are some very gory scenes and intense images regarding what the serial killer actually does. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins both won an oscar for this highy acclaimed movie in 1991 for Best Actor and Best Actress. Jonathen Demme also won for best director and the movie won best picture. I also recommend the book by Thomas Harris because it is as good as the movie. This DVD also offers 20 minutes of deleted scenes that never made it into the theatrical version and it has over an hours' worth of footage on how the movie was made. The moving making also includes interesting interviews by Jodi Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Ted Levine and many other people who were directly involved in this project a must see. They also reveal how certain props were used for scenes in the movie and how they had to do some research on how to make the movie shots look more realisitic.  This DVD has a photo gallery of scenes that were made during the movie altough they are mostly outtakes when the camera wasn't rolling.

Darth Vader, Jason Voorhees, Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers, but one of the names that will always evoke fear, and is a more realistic villain, is none other than Dr. Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter.  After the successful adaptation of Thomas Harris' first novel featuring the psychotic Lecter, ""Red Dragon"", though the first movie based on the novel was called ""Manhunter"", it was later remade with Anthony Hopkins in the title role in the movie ""Red Dragon"", it was really no big surprise that MGM began working on a film based on the second book by Thomas Harris featuring Lecter, ""The Silence of the Lambs"".

""The Silence of the Lambs"" takes place directly where the movie ""Red Dragon"" left off.  Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) had just finished helping Will Graham, the FBI agent who imprisoned him, catch the killer known as 'The Tooth Fairy'.  Now, Lecter is being visited by an FBI agent-in-training, Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), who was sent by her superiors to interview Lecter, and hopefully gleam some insight from him about the motives of a new serial killer calling himself, 'Buffalo Bill'.  However, the only way Lecter will help Starling is if she will answer his questions in regards to her life.  But, the deeper Lecter probes , forcing Clarice to face demons long-since buried, the stronger the fascination Lecter has for Clarice grows.  Will Clarice and the FBI gain enough insight from Lecter to stop 'Buffalo Bill', or is Lecter merely using them to accomplish his own means?

Terrific directing on behalf of Jonathan Demme, and outstanding performances by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is by far one of the most shocking, suspenseful thrillers ever to be made.  Winning over both audiences and critics alike, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" earned every one of its 5 academy awards, including Best Picture.

But... what's the deal with the flags?

It happens that all the most violent, brutal scenes in the picture are accompanied, in defiance of context and sense, by the appearance of Old Glory in various guises. (And don't take my word for it, check it out for yourself.)

Specifically: the scene featuring Lector in the cage, which is, inexplicably, draped with stars and stripes banners extending from the corners of the cage to the ceiling (it looks as if they're preparing him for use as a 4th of July float). The murdered cop ends up draped amongst them. (I've often wondered precisely how he got up there. Hauled up by a middle-aged man in the midst of an escape attempt, you say? Okay, let's move on...)

Then there's the climax. As Claire Sterling faces off against Buffalo Bill, there's the flag behind him, apropos of nothing, on the kitchen wall. And finally, at the end of that lengthy chase across the 500-yard-long basement, Claire's shots blow out a window... And there, dead-center, bobs a child's-size flag, perky as all get-out.

There's a few other instances, but they're explicable. These, though... Banners on a cage? I don't get it. Is Lector running for office? Are the Democrats that desperate? (The GOP doesn't need him; they've got Karl Rove.) The flag in the kitchen -- okay, the most fervid Bircher hyperpatriot might do this, but Buffalo Bill, a dragster in the midst of making himself a woman suit, does not appear to meet that description. So maybe the dead lady in the bathtub put it there. But I challenge anybody to explain how a new unfaded mini-flag got into the window of an abandoned basement.

Of course, it's all symbolism, but of what, precisely? No sensible answer to that exists either. Demme may be a notorious lefty, but going this far to associate the flag with murderous, psychopathic violence strikes me as a bit of a stretch.

All the same, somebody put 'em in, and there must be an explanation. I'd like to hear what it is.

Again, a great film. But I wish they wouldn't do stuff like this. It's creepy, in an unpleasant and totally uninteresting way.

The movie was elegant and quiet. The pacing was pitch perfect. You've got to see the clever intercutting scenes towards the end of the movie as Clarice and the FBI agents separately hunt for Buffalo Bill. It was brilliantly shot and edited. And of course the extended ending was a classic.

Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins were perfection. All of their scenes together are electrifying especially their first meeting. The role of Clarice was originally offered to Michelle Pfeiffer (she passed because she felt uncomfortable with the subject matter) and I always wondered how the movie would've turned out.

154632,5,0792842111,"This movie is based on the Thomas Harris novel of the same name. A serial killer dubbed by the media Buffalo Bill has already kidnapped and murdered five women. Their bodies have been found partially skinned. Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), head of the FBI's serial killer unit, chooses bright, dedicated young Academy trainee Clarice Starling to interview an incarcerated sociopath, Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter. In addition to being mad as a hatter, Lecter is a brilliant psychologist; Crawford believes Lecter will respond to Clarice's decency, her beauty, her femaleness, and thus be lured into providing a psychological profile of Buffalo Bill that might help capture him. When Bill kidnaps his next victim, a Senator's daughter, Clarice dedicates herself to finding Bill before he can kill the girl.

Orion Pictures tapped Jonathan Demme to direct The Silence of the Lambs, seemingly a strange choice to helm a project dealing with such grim, intense material. Demme's previous movies were lightweight comedies like Something Wild and Married to the Mob. At first Demme wanted Michelle Pfeiffer to play Clarice Starling. He'd just directed her in Married to the Mob. Pfeiffer turned down the role; after reading the script she thought it was too violent. Meanwhile Jodie Foster had been campaigning for the part. Demme was familiar with Foster, of course, but wasn't sure he could see her as Clarice Starling. In the DVD's excellent hour-long ""Making Of"" featurette, screenwriter Ted Tally relates how Demme told him about meeting Jodie Foster, and what finally convinced him she was right for the role: ""I watched her coming down the hall towards me. This sturdy little figure, striding along, with this determined look on her face. And I just thought, 'That's her. That's Clarice Starling.'""

To play Hannibal Lecter, Orion wanted Robert Duvall. Demme felt casting an actor of Duvall's familiarity would have worked against the role, that audiences would always see Robert Duvall up there on-screen instead of Hannibal Lecter. Instead Demme wanted the highly accomplished and respected but comparatively unknown English actor Anthony Hopkins. When Demme flew to London to meet with Hopkins, the actor asked him, ""Why cast me?"" Demme said he'd seen Hopkins portrayal of Dr. Treves in The Elephant Man. Hopkins said, ""But Treves is a very good man,"" to which Demme replied, ""Well, that's what I want for Lecter. That's he's a compassionate man, he's a humanitarian, he's a good man locked inside this insane mind.""

In the translation from novel to movie, certain changes had to be made, one being that the book's multiple viewpoint narrative was largely jettisoned. Demme made an early choice to show the movie, where possible, from Clarice Starling's viewpoint, that in every scene in which the character was present there would be at least one point-of-view shot where we looked through Clarice's eyes, for maximum viewer identification with the character.

Theater audiences responded strongly and immediately to this film. It was the #1 movie in America for five weeks after its release, and stayed in the Top 10 just forever. Why was that? It wasn't because it was a big budget spectacular. Silence of the Lambs was made for 20 million dollars; a modest bankroll even in 1991 money. Certainly we must give credit to the great script, the great direction, to Ted Levine's eerie portrayal of Buffalo Bill. However, I believe that at heart there were two main reasons for the movie's popularity.

(1) The performances of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins as Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter. As Lecter gets to know Clarice, he obviously finds her stimulating and attractive. The most fascinating scenes, really the heart of the movie, are those where these two great actors simply talk to each other. Lecter taunts and bedevils Clarice - he is, after all, a sadist who's been locked behind glass, unable to inflict pain, for years - while alternately cajoling and praising her toward unlocking the mystery of Buffalo Bill, like Socrates with a prize pupil. Part of the reason Lecter needles Clarice, I think, is to see if she can take it. And she can. She listens, perseveres, responds intelligently, maintains her dignity in the face of a psychological rape that would send a lesser personality fleeing or screaming, and eventually gets everything she wants out of Lecter. He respects that. And so these two very different people attempt to understand each other. Clarice struggles to understand what it's like to be a monster. Lecter attempts to understand what makes a hero.

(2) The female main character. Women are still, in our society, perceived as vulnerable, or at least more generally vulnerable than men. The film constantly underlines the fact that Clarice is a woman operating in a man's world, doing a traditionally male job. Whenever a movie or TV show tries to portray a female hero, usually she's an unstoppable assassin or somesuch. But Clarice Starling IS vulnerable, and decent, and caring. We travel along with this believable, admirable woman as she progresses on what is very much a traditional hero's journey. We watch her do battle with monsters, both Lecter and Buffalo Bill. We see her face her own fears, both physical and psychological, and overcome them. Eventually this leads her down into a dungeon, there to face a dragon in its lair, to win or die, all to save a princess.

In 1991, Jody Foster won the Best Actress Academy Award for her performance as Clarice Starling; Anthony Hopkins was Best Actor as Dr. Hannibal Lecter; Jonathan Demme was Best Director; Ted Tally took Best Screenplay Based On Material Previously Produced or Published. All richly deserved. As is pointed out by film critic Amy Taubin, it's difficult to characterize The Silence of the Lambs. It's a weird and amazingly successful hybrid: a police procedural, a psychological drama, a Gothic horror movie, a slasher film with no slashing. This is arguably the best thriller-to-movie translation ever made. Hell, it's in the top tier of NOVELS to movie, period.",1120176000,2,6078,5.084168336673347
154633,5,0792842111,"Though my dedication to this film sometimes freaks people out (I've been known to quote it at somewhat inopportune moments), I don't think it's anything to be ashamed of. This film is a brilliant, tightly-plotted masterpiece, a tour de force of masterful acting, absorbing dialogue, and tempo and pacing that is at once highly tense and soothingly mesmerizing. The give-and-take between Starling and Lector has an almost heartbeat-like rhythm, quiet and subtle yet extraordinarily powerful. I don't think it's inappropriate to say that this film doesn't hit any truly false notes. The main reason that my friends often won't watch this film is simply because it scares them too much -- which, I believe, is one of the film's greatest triumphs.",1119657600,2,743,5.148760330578512
154634,5,0792842111,"This film based on Thomas Harris's masterpiece of a novel, is equally a masterpiece. Hopkins and Foster deliver Oscar winning performances and the adapted screenplay from the novel is great, leaving in all of the best moments.

Hopkins stars as Hannibal Lecter, an imprisoned cannibal, who is interviewed by Agent Clarice Starling, played by Foster. He is interviewed by her on information on a series of killings. She asks information on ""Buffalo Bill"", a killer who skins women. Hannibal aggrees, but in return asks for personal information on Starling. Starling doesn't know though whether Lecter is just playing with her or whether or not he is giving true information. When a senator's daughter gets kidnapped, the chase is on.

I am about to give away an event which some people may not want to know before watching this film.

The movie contains the best scene of all time, that beeing Hannibal's escape; while the conclusion is absolutely brilliant. This thriller is heart pounding and smart and fast, and is recommended to everyone. It is my favorite movie of all time, and I recommend reading the book also as it gives away more interesting information.",1119312000,3,1163,4.984536082474227
154635,5,0792842111,"In 1990, when I first saw this film it left me so unnerved that it was several days before I could get the images out of my mind.  And it has been 15 years before I thought it might be worthwhile to see it again.  I was no stranger to slash horror back then, but Silence really goes somewhere else entirely.  It's as if you and Agent Starling peeked into a pit and suddenly found yourselves lost in the mind of something demonically dark.  It's as if one ripped away the darkness, and found that underneath was even more darkness.

From the moments of Starling's (Jodie Foster) first meetings with Dr. Hannibal Lector (Tony Hopkins) the film's atmospherics build in hypnotic fashion.  You have entered a world full of overcast skies and dark chambers within dark chambers on a dual quest to track down a killer who skins his victims while trying to rescue one's sanity from the grasp of a sociopath so skilled that love and pain become inextricable enmeshed.

Of course, the years have wrought many changes in the perceptions of the viewers.  While the film still has it's ghoulish moments the victims no longer prey on the mind as they did 15 years ago.  We've become harder to shock, yet Hopkins builds Lector's character so well that we become haunted instead by the idea that there is a Hannibal Lector hiding behind each of our masks.

From the viewpoint of social commentary the film has two conflicting claims.  Agent Starling presented an unusually strong image for a woman in a suspense film, a hero rather than a helpless victim.  Unfortunately the film managed to unintentionally upset the gay community with Ted Levine's portrayal of killer Jame Gumb.  He is actually a transvestite, not a homosexual, but that's easy to lose in the translation, and this was a time when film rarely portrayed individuals with alternate lifestyles in a positive manner.

On watching it again, I finally managed to actually 'see' Jonathan Demme's work as director.  This was not a high budget film by our current standards.  Even so Demme manages to extract every ounce of impact from what he does have.  Visual themes are carefully developed, framing is superb, and the viewer reaaly feels in the film rather than simply watching.  This still remains a film to see.",1119052800,35,2260,4.736572890025576
154636,5,0792842111,"The Silence of the Lambs is the first Horror movie to win the Best Picture Academy Award.  While that distinction rightfully belonged to The Exorcist us Horror fans take what we can get.  Certainly the Horror genre didn't need (and still doesn't) an award to validate its importance to film, but an honor is an honor so I'll leave it at that.

Even without all the accolades, The Silence of the Lambs would be revered and considered a classic example of filmmaking.  There is nothing more disconcerting, yet fascinating to the American public than the act of murder.  The fascination is compounded exponentially when murder is committed in quantity.  Add the seeming randomness of serial slayings, the understanding that anybody could be next, and the result is fanaticism.  That's right, Americans are fans of murder.  The bloodier the better, as long as it's far away and happening to someone else.

Many serial killers have achieved celebrity status.  Some have become legend, both living and dead.  Hannibal Lecter, although a fictional construct, ranks among them.  Anthony Hopkins unsettling and convincing portrayal of the cannibal doctor is perhaps one of the most talked about film perfomances of all time.  The character of Lecter has since joined the American Lexicon of Boogeymen, usually a realm reserved for supernatural monsters.  The plausibility of Lecter makes him all the more frightening, his deviance coupled with his uncanny intelligence plays upon our fears of strangers, of being eaten, and the ultimate terror of being outsmarted.

Somehow Hollywood recognized a superior monster story and awarded it accordingly.  The novel by Thomas Harris is so closely adhered to in script as to almost be one in the same.  In essence watching the film was like watching the book.  When so often the saying that the book is better than the movie unfortunately (but logically) rings true, finding a film that compliments and accentuates the source material is like stumbling upon cinematic gold.

The Silence of the Lambs captured the imagination and attention of American moviegoers like few Horror films have.  Perhaps this is due in part to the fact that most didn't realize they were watching a Horror film to begin with.  I'm sure Chianti sales skyrocketed, perhaps even sales of fava beans.  One thing is for certain, people began to ask what exactly was in the entree at dinner parties, praying the answer wasn't Bob or Lisa.",1118361600,3,2443,5.055

Cast:  Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, Anthony Heald, Ted Levine, Tracey Martin, Charles Napier, Brooke Smith.

Running Time:  121 minutes.

Rated R for violence, gore, and language.

Rivaling ""Seven"" as the best thriller of the decade, ""Silence of the Lambs"" is the quintessential blockbuster thriller, driven by marvelous performances, a polished, intelligent adaptation from the best-selling novel, stupendous cinematography, and a first-rate musical score.  Highly respected in the movie-making industry, the film is one of the few true horror/thrillers to ever win the Best Picture Academy Award (1991).  Tailored from Thomas Harris's incredibly popular novel with an unforgettably astute screenplay, ""Silence of the Lambs"" lunges into a world of madness, dread, and cannibalism never seen before on the big screen and is portrayed by director Jonathan Demme (""Philadelphia"") in near-perfect fashion.

Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster, in her best role since ""Taxi Driver"") is just a regular, hard-nosed wannabe FBI trainee-agent looking for her shot at the big time when she is summoned into the office of her boss, Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), for a special task.  An unattainable, sex-demented serial killer (Ted Levine) who preys on obese women and whose media-given title as ""Buffalo Bill"" is still on the loose and is striking with an escalating frequency that Crawford will go to any lengths to get some answers.  When the daughter (Brooke Smith) of a successful politician shows up missing, the FBI feels amplified pressure to crack the case.  Crawford suggests to Starling that she investigate the matter by profiling a similar cannibalistic serial killer named Hannibal Lecter (performed perfectly by the talented Anthony Hopkins), who is now located at a maximum security prison and knows the ins and outs of the notorious Buffalo Bill.  As Clarice learns more and more about the anomalous killer from the horrific Lecter, she also has to confront her own inner demons in order to save future victims.

""The Silence of the Lambs"" is superbly directed by Demme, who uses the camera as a painting canvas to illuminate the horrors that the human mind can produce, mixing spine-tingling close-ups, many accented long-shots, and one famous ""night-vision"" sequence to enhance the eerie ambiance.  Foster is truly brilliant, showing true performing range as a mixture of woman determinism and psychological sprite in search of internal peace.  Hopkins is shockingly delightful as the tongue-in-cheek maniac with a sly sense of humor, a mesmerizing lisp, and one intense thirst for human blood.  The screenplay adaptation by Ted Tally is pin-point and meticulously designed to pay homage to the exceptional novel, capturing the essence of the troubled young FBI agent and the sexual perplexity of our film's main antagonist.

The scene where Jodie Foster first visits Hannibal Lector (Hopkins) in prison is one of those classic scenes that stays with the viewer forever.  This is a jarring, scary, and even upsetting film, but it is also a fabulous and powerful viewing experience that should not be passed up.

No spoilers here, but the basic theme of the film is that Hannibal Lector (Hopkins) is a serial killer-cannibal with a sky-high IQ who has finally been captured by the FBI.  Jodie Foster turns in a very fine performance as Agent Starling, an FBI trainee who is detailed to do some background research on Lecter.  Things immediately spin out of control, and this is a fast-paced and scary film that never drags but is not for the faint of heart.

Granted, its not for all tastes to enjoy, but even if you didn't like this film like I did, its hard not to appreciate the surreal feel that the cast and crew have added to the similar movie Manhunter.

 FBI in training officer Clarice Sterling[Jodie Foster] has been assigned by her boss Jack Crawford[Scott Glenn] to interview homicidal cannibal psycho Dr. Hannibal Lecter[Anthony Hopkins]. The leads all give outstanding and realistic performances in an interesting way, so its no wonder why Hopkins and Foster took home Best Actor and Best Actress respectively at the 1992 Oscars.

 Lecter you see is a 'former' serial killer, who ate his victims as he graphically states in one now infamous scene. He'll still stop at nothing to get a sick gratification from killing the innocent. He may know more than he's letting on about a dangerous, homoerotic character named Buffalo Bill[Ted Levine] who kills and brutally tortures his victims. Both of the killers in this film give very gritty yet frightenly realistic performances as the film's villians. Its up to Clarice to gain enough of Lecter's trust to help track down the other psycho killer who has now kidnapped a senator's daughter.

 This film really does play with your mind, enough so to scare you even. Its not exactly a pleasant movie, dealing with the laws of cannibalism and psychology, but its believeable enough to make you say 'wow!' upon finishing it. Therefore, it should be no wonder as to why it was named best picture 13 years ago. Some may call this another slasher film, but the murders we do see are not the main point.

The whole thing is pretty damned implausible --- although, again, this didn't seem to matter while you were watching. Where did Hannibal get his face mask from during the unbelievable escape sequence? (Now I get it: he skinned the dead cop's face and put it over his own. Credible?)  How did he manage to nick the warden's propelling pencil? I didn't think Buffalo Bill was too convincing --- rather hammy, imho. Jodie was good, Hopkins was good.

A sexual serial killer known as Buffalo Bill, is kidnapping women across Midwest America, murdering them and dumping their mutilated bodies near a river. Behavioral science division of the FBI sends Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) on a mission to a prison/hospital for the criminally insane to interview the serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to see if he can help with the investigation by giving her clues for a psychological profile of Buffalo Bill. Hannibal the Cannibal is cryptic and illusive sending Starling around the country mostly searching for something unknown that Hannibal has directed her towards. Not only does he give her some details as to the psychological profile of the killer but he eludes to much more than she originally thought he knew. Hannibal starts to play games with Starling, ever eager to impress her boss, by giving her a psychological profile of herself in return for more information about the case. An uncanny and often dangerous relationship begins and things take a turn for the worse when a senator's daughter is kidnapped causing various government agencies to impede the case which sets up a gripping climax as the illusive Lecter plays people into his own hands.

Essentially it is smart horror movie with lots of dialogue, plot and suspense. It is both mystical and disturbing. Demme often uses the camera directly with the actor looking at you to make the movie more ""personal"" in nature.

In LAMBS she surpasses all of her previous efforts by light years! As fledgling FBI agent Clarice Starling, she must rise above herself (as the awkward neophite), in order to stare down evil in it's purest form. Clarice is introduced to Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), an infamous serial killer who also happens to be a genius. Kept in the deepest part of an asylum, Hannibal is overjoyed to see Clarice, and must ultimately assist her in capturing Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), the latest serial murdererer to steal the headlines. The interplay between Hannibal and Clarice is the dark, fleshy heart of this story. All else is incidental scenery and fluff. The horror, gore, and suspense only serve as a framework for this meeting of the minds. Starling is trying to save lives, while Lecter is trying to get into the depths of her soul. Each gives up only enough to get them to the next ascending level of their symbiotic relationship. Clarice grows increasingly desperate and dependent on Hannibal as Bill's latest captive gets nearer to her impending expiration date. She finds herself forced to reveal to Lecter, the very events / memories that have most terrified and damaged her, hidden things she has shared with no one else.

2.  Hannibal is so dangerous and inventive that people are cautioned to not even let a paper clip be provided to him.

The Silence of the Lambs, adapted from a novel by Thomas Harris centres around Federal Agent Clarice Starling and her attempts to go through one serial killer to catch another, the plot is dark and often disturbing but this is all the desired effect, Jonathan Demme does a superb job conveying Clarice's mixed emotions on screen and Jodie Foster's sublime acting talents pay dividends. The emotions of the watcher are also toyed with and this adds to the hysteria created when viewing.

  It is also one of the most crisp and original adaptations ever made, it is extremely good at mimicing certain things out of the novel but doesn't just copy it outright, it has its own ideas too, such as the ""look deep with in yourself Clarice Starling"" and replacing the Big Amarone with a nice Chianti which I do think has a better ring to it.

  The dialogue is fantastic memroable quotes straddle he annals of this film with bits of "" all those tedious sticky fumblings on the backseats of cars"" and him looking with a smile and his head dipped through the see through barrier having a quid pro quo with his student, this direction and acting style gives Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal 'the cannibal' a charismatic but extremely disturbing aura about himself and is some of the best thought out and well structured film conversation pieces ever devised by man, I can understand just what it would be like for Clarice with all her problems and sympathizing with her is easy, just as I am repelled by Buffalo Bill and the fact someone could be like that sends chills down my spine, and I don't know about you but I root for Hannibal in the film, is he a hero or a villain? It is easy to say he is a psychopathic human eater, but it also clear and easy to say that he did save Katherine Martin from certain death, by asserting his key insight that he has so typcally been established as the character/engima that is so fantastically put onto the screen.

  The action scenes are built with skills beyond that of nearly any other film ever made, it is a horror film, it is a thriller, it is a drama and it incorporates these genres and merges them with great effect to create this masterpiece. It won oscars and not just the odd one, it won best picture, director, actor, actress and adapted screenplay it deserved more still, honestly it should be in the hall of fame of the world, there should be a museum devoted entirely to it and only the silence, not its unworthy sequels or prequels which don't capture the audience with as much power as this fantasic film, Hannibal has no particular build up to action sequences and is nowhere near as good, maybe the absence of Jodie Foster as Clarice is the main reason, and also with Red Dragon the fact that these additions to the silence were made in excess of ten years later Anthony Hopkins doesn't convey the same eerie and scary persona as what he did in 1991 and looks ten times older its a shame they even made them they nearly demean the silence of the lambs but luckily Demme made it so it could never be degraded it is too good for that.

 It is true, so very true, this film is too good to be true I just go ""f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f "" everytime I see it.",1100044800,2,3262,4.429048414023372
154673,5,0792842111,"Jonathan Demme would have been the last person you would expect to direct a thriller, particularly one with such seamy undertones.  Essentially, he made his name with off-beat comedies prior to this(""Handle With Care"", ""Melvin and Howard"", ""Something Wild"", ""Married to the Mob"").  It was probably a blessing that someone like him directed this film because despite the darkness of the material, he handles it in a non-exploitative manner.  The story concerns a manhunt for a serial kidnapper-killer, Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) who preys on girls of a certain body-weight, most recently the daughter of a U.S. Senator.  One of the FBI investigators is a young female trainee, Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), who utilizes an imprisoned cannibal psychiatrist, Hannibal Lector(Anthony

 Hopkins) in her search for Buffalo Bill.  Despite the fact that Lecter repells her, Starling continues to utilize him because of his invaluable insight into the inner workings of the criminal mindset.  Foster is excellent in her Oscar-winning role as Starling.  Hopkins is creepily seductive as Lecter.  It's unfortunate that he made a parody of this character in two repellant sequels, ""Hannibal"" and ""Red Dragon"".  Solid work is also delivered here by Levine, Scott Glenn as Jack Crawford, Starling's superior, and Anthony Heald as the disagreeable head of the mental hospital housing Lecter, Dr. Chilton.",1097193600,2,1391,5.423255813953489
154674,5,0792842111,"It took me so long to work up the courage to see this movie, and I'm glad that I finally did.  Although not for the faint of heart, this movie was not as gory as I had braced myself for.  Most of the scares stem from Hannibal Lector's mannerisms and Buffalo Bill's creepy behavior between kills. The most shocking violence occurs near the end, which I will not spoil for anyone intending to see the film.  Just don't say you were not warned.
  ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is very easy to get caught up in, but must be seen from beginnig to end in order to get the full impact of Jodi Foster's and Anthony Hopkin's performances.

154675,5,0792842111,"Unlike most people, I'd never seen this movie before until just recently and I watched it right after reading the book. So while I was watching it I kept comparing it with the book. I'll say this much: Silence of the Lambs is one of the best movies based on a book that I've ever seen. This is thanks in part to the exceptionally strong performances by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster. Anthony Hopkins gives one of the most electrifying and mesmerizing performances I have ever seen in a movie. He's actually much different from the way I pictured Lecter when I was reading the book but Hopkin's acting in this movie is so chilling and malevolent that I don't mind the differences. Jodie Foster is just wonderful as Clarice Starling, she really captures Clarice's strength and vulnerbility. You can really relate to the character and her feelings. One thing that I liked a lot about this movie is that the conversations between Lecter and Clarice are mainly done in close ups, which gives these scenes an even greater intensity. Hopkins and Foster are of course the two most memorable performances in this movie but the other actors are also very good. Anthony Heald is excellent as the swarmy and annoying Dr. Chilton, Ted Levine (who's on the tv show Monk now) is extremely creepy and disgusting in his role as Jame Gumb, and Scott Glenn makes a good Jack Crawford. Although this is an excellent film, I still like the book better than the movie. There are alot of great things in the book that are missing in the movie, although the movie is a very close adaption. There is one thing however that was handled better in the movie than the book and that was Clarice's past. Clarice trying to save the lamb instead of her horse Hannah (which was in the book) seemed to work better with the storyline. This is an excellent movie but if you're one of the very few people out there who have never seen it before then I'd recommend that you should read the book first, because it's just fantastic.",1093651200,,1994,4.572625698324022

the shock value is unbelievable and next to Hannibal is probably

the most shocking. Lector does some viscious sadistic things in this one as you will see. But the shock value is not just their

it's gonna be ugly and bloody. And these scenes are used to display the horroriffying and bizzare character that is Hannibal

154688,5,0792842111,"Roger Ebert said, ""I t has been a good long while since I have felt the presence of Evil so manifestly demonstrated as in the first appearance of Anthony Hopkins in ""The Silence of the Lambs"", and it is exactly that manifestation of evil caused The Silence of Lambs to leave such an indelible mark on moviegoers. Hopkins performance surely rates as one of the best performances, male or female, in Hollywood history.
Credit also goes, in enormous quantities, to Jonathan Demme and Jodie Foster. To Demme because he realized that the horror of this film was psychological, and to Foster because her perfectly played naivet to Lecter's arrogant worldliness created the canvas on which the film resonates.
Too many thrillers and wanna-be thrillers fall into the least common denominator - trite scare tactics. Here, there was nothing trite. The images were clear, original, and gripping.
I've seen this film half a dozen times (there are very few films that I've watched more than twice), and every time my mind brings up the scene that Ebert is referring to - in Chilton's psychiatric ward - my mind's eye sees Lecter wearing orange. This is Demme's brilliance. He has done such a terrific job of creating Lecter as a devil, that when I think of him, I clothe him in colors of fire. In reality, he wears blue in that scene.
In a later scene, the scene that names the book and film, Lecter is imprisoned in a tall cage in the center of a wide open room, and Foster sneaks in to visit him, hoping to garner more clues to the murder she's investigating (it's easy to forget while watching this film that there is something going on other than the relationship between Lecter and Starling, like the other serial murderer in the film, the one that is actively killing people). This is where Demme (and Hopkins and Foster, for that matter) shines. Lecter, seated, asks Starling, ""What does he do, this man you seek?"" Starling answers, ""He kills women."" ""No, that is incidental,"" Lecter replies. When Lecter speaks - and his diction is flawless, perfect, and amazing, capturing his contemptful personality - the camera is completely focused on his face, and the lighting and shadows that Demme employs evokes images of every devil or demon our imagination, or literature, has ever conjured.
This scene, and everything that follows (the second meal of raw meat, the killing of the guards), is a breathtaking piece of artistry.
This is, quite simply, the very best thriller Hollywood has ever produced.",1088985600,,2491,4.822429906542056

The story, as we all know by now, revolves around haunted FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) trying to get information out of imprisoned cannibalistic killer Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) on a serial killer called Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine).  The amazing interplay between Foster and Hopkins is the film's main highlight, but the laced with suspense prison break will have you jolting out of your seat.  Those who have never seen this film should definitely pick up this generously priced extra laced DVD, but the long out of print Criterion Collection DVD is more than worth tracking down as well.",1087171200,,929,4.830188679245283
154691,4,0792842111,"Dr. Lecter is a fabulous psychiatrist. But in some moment of his troubled mind, he suffered a turning point ; the taste for the human meat reveals a turning point. The line between insanity and sanity is very thin. Indeed, Dr. Lecter walks in the frontier and decides to live in this risky equilibrium state of life.
Clarice Sterling is a rookie but smart girl who wants to make the grade as FBI agent. The interviews with Dr. Lecter are indeed the highest peak in the movie.
Lecter opens his soul before his female image . There's a rapture and reciprocal admiration among them. He loves Florence , he lives into his memories , he lives in jail but his mind flies to different worlds and in many levels.
Sterling keeps for him a blended mix of suggested love-hate, and in the progress of the investigation he plays the role of spiritual father. More than a clear guidance for solving the difficuly case, the emotional lines involve , he keeps a discret distance but he's in love with Clarice, because she represents the alter ego of him.
The script goes OK , but when Dr. Lecter leaves the hospital with the Goldberg Variations as musical background ( a smart clue ) and commits murder on these two cops, he film looses force and spreads around common places. Demme holds the attention viewer thanks to a skillful handle camera , but that scene is extremely gore and makes you assume a discret distance about the great realism introduced from the first opening sequences.
When Anthony Hopkins talks with Clarice about the silence the lambs, literally breaks the veil around her intimate soul. That sequence for me it's the highest dramatic point in the film. I mean this film is a fight minds , an archetypical conflict , a chess game between two brilliant minds, egos  and personalities. That's why the film wins, because the dramatic locus turns around this duel.
Foster and Hopkins are in the top and in many ways reminds us to the couple Fletcher- Nicholson in the cuckoo's nest , Colbert -Gable in It happened one night , or Bogart- Bacall in the big sleep.

This movie follows the tracking of a deranged serial killer only known as Buffalo Bill. He kills fat women and then dumps their bodies in rivers before cutting part of their skin off in order to make a female body suit. FBI office Starling tries to get Hannibal Lector to tell her who Buffalo Bill is and why he is doing it. Hannibal though enjoys toying with people minds and only answers in strange riddles. He gives  the littlest bit of information to the Senetor whose daughter was kidnapped by Buffalo Bill in order for him to escape his prison. He does it in such a sick way by cutting a man's face of in order to pretend he was the person. Thinking he was the poilceman he was rushed to the hospital but in the ambulance he made his escape. Agent Starling finds the pverted Buffalo Bill and does a fast paced chase of him through his house before killing him. Dr. Lector though has a little phone call for her though before hanging up and going to go eat the doctor who locked him up for so many years.

Bottom line is this is one of the best movies based on one of Thomas Harris's books. Personally I love the movie ""Manhunter"" as well and I 'm not sure why Thomas Harris wouldn't let them use the ""Red Dragon"" title back in 1986. I think William Petersen was great in Manhunter.

Jodie Fosters performance is remarkable. She makes me believe in her part. She makes me believe she came from West Virginia. She makes me beleive she is vulnerable but strong. Her scenes with ""Wild Bill"" are extremely tense. To me it is one of the best performances she has ever done.

Actors Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster and Scott Glenn captivate their audienced and dominate their competition by winning numerous awards including an Oscar for best picture and an Academy Award for best screenplay.

However, the movie lost me early on with the premise that an FBI academy student would be chosen for an important assignment.  Thus I found myself following the rest of the movie wondering what the heck Jodie Foster was doing in the center of all the action.  Then there was the casting for Hannibal Lector.  This character is going to have to convince the audience that he possesses not only a brilliant mind but also a powerful physique.  Enter Anthony Hopkins and exit my interest in this character.  By now I'm hoping that Scott Glenn will show up more often so I can have someone whose role I can accept.
There are several confusing sequences in the movie that detract further from its' quality.  Maybe it's just me but I was totally confused by a scene with Jodie Foster and a group of local lawmen gathered when one of their own was found.  Ms. Foster gave a little speech that made absolutely no sense to me.  Then there was the incredible scene in which Hannibal Lector was transfered to Memphis or some such place at the request of some influencial politician (like that made any sense).  We have a hotel with two divisions of policemen in it to guard Lector (and two cops actually doing the job).  We are expected to accept that Lector is able to overpower the two cops, create a gruesome disguise and escape (presumeably by overpowering even more inept individuals).  It was quite a series of events but I didn't buy the concept that it could have happened in the first place.
Well, enough of my complaints.  My point is that I felt the movie lacked credibility.  I think viewers were fascinated with the concept of Hannibal Lector and tended to accept whatever they were asked to.

154745,5,0792842111,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is by far one of the scariest, most effectively haunting stories ever to be told, and what director could tell it better than Jonathan Demme? His close-up shots of the actors gives it a hypnotic effect. It really feels like Dr. Hannibal Lector is penetrating straight through your mind. Anthony Hopkins gives a remarkable performance. He relishes in his villainous character, Hannibal ""the cannibal"" Lector. Jodie Foster couldn't have been better as Clarice Starling, a young new agent who wants so badly to help save the victim of a madman on a killing spree. While Clarice tries to obtain information from Lector on the case, Lector obtains information from Clarice's personal life, from her past. Just as Clarice wants to see what makes a madman tick, Lector wants to see what drives a hero. Fans of horror won't be disappointed, and also fans of thrillers.

154748,5,0792842111,"Enough good things can not be said about this film.  THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is a horror-thriller-drama in one, a masterpiece of modern cinema that swept in five Academy Awards including Best Picture.  Loosely adapted from the best-seller by Thomas Harris, the film follows Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), a young FBI trainee who must play an imprisoned cannibal genius' (Anthony Hopkins) mind games while trying to single-handedly track down a psychotic serial killer (Ted Levine).  THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is deservedly a legend, which was followed by three sequels (chronologically, the film occurs after it's second sequel, RED DRAGON).  Let me try to sum up my good thoughts in words.  Jonathan Demme turns this from a masterpiece to a work of art with his outstanding direction and intriguing Point-of-View shots; Ted Tally writes the creepy, intelligent screenplay; then there's a short but very nice score by Howard Shore.  Foster is at her best and portrays the character better than anyone else could try; Scott Glenn is good as her section chief, and Anthony Heald is good as the annoying and ignorant Dr. Chilton; Levine is very good as well, and brings out the character just as he should be.  But the true highlight of the film is Anthony Hopkins as polite and genius Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter; Hopkins gives his best performance and one of the best performances ever captured on film - there is no doubt in my mind Hannibal Lecter is the ultimate villain.  THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS must be seen to believed.  Make sure you take a bite out of this artful masterpiece!",1063152000,3,1593,4.87037037037037

Anthony Hopkins won an Oscar for best actor for this movies and he is in less than 30 minutes, that's how good he is in this role.  Jodie Foster is also really good in this movie as the FBI academy student sent to interview a madman.  The DVD is also fairly well put together with some interesting extra's.

The movie intrigues me. It is very atmospheric. I have seen other Jonathan Demme films and none of them achieve what he did here. This is his peak. I even bought the CD soundtrack for the dark, moody, atmospheric music.
Jodie Foster absolutely blew me away with this film. I saw it on vacation and the film is more memorable than the vacation. I can honestly say it is in my top 5 favorite films of all time. I readily bought the DVD upon its release. It is the most important movie in my collection.",1059696000,3,750,4.215277777777778
154751,5,0792842111,"Thomas Harris wrote three novels on which four different films are based: Manhunter (1986) and Red Dragon (2002) based on the same novel as well as Hannibal (2001) and this film. After a decade, it retains its strengths in terms directing, acting, and production values. For obvious reasons, however, it has lost much of its emotional impact for those such as I who have seen it several times since its initial release in 1991. Nonetheless, I find it every bit as entertaining now as I did then but for different reasons.
For example, the compelling personality of Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) had such an impact on me the first time around that I paid little attention to information revealed about Clarice Starling's childhood. Jody Foster received an Academy Award for her performance as did Hopkins and director Jonathan Demme. Well-deserved. I now have a much better appreciation of the evolving relationship between Lecter and Starling, and a much better understanding of childhood influences on her values and especially her vulnerabilities. Also, I now have a greater appreciation of the performances of others, notably Ted Levine (Jame ""Buffalo Bill"" Gumb). During the final confrontation, he more than holds his own with the highly talented Foster. Finally, I am now more aware of Jack Crawford's importance to Starling. Portraying her supervisor, Scott Glenn appears only briefly but makes a critically important contribution to Starling's development, both personally and professionally. Her judgment proves better than his as they pursue Buffalo Bill and he duly acknowledges that.
As I now think again about this film, I realize that the dominant image previously had been of Lecter in his cell, smiling serenely at the earnest young F.B.I. agent. Whenever I heard a reference to the film or to Lecter, that is what immediately came to mind. Now, the dominant image is of the ""cage"" in which Lecter is served a lamb chop dinner by two of the guards. I recall it so vividly...and shudder.
The DVD version of a film offers clearer image and sound (which I certainly appreciate) but also, more often than not, a ""bonus"" of supplementary materials. In this instance, they include 20 minutes of deleted scenes, interviews of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins, a ""making-of"" featurette, and a reel of out-takes.",1059523200,5,2327,5.110236220472441
154782,5,0792842111,"I first took interest in this film when I was 12 because I am a big Jodie Foster fan. And as I expected she gave an excellent Oscar winning performance, as did Anthony Hopkins. The role of FBI trainee Clarice Starling was a perfect follow up to her previous Oscar winning film ""The Accused"". Anthony Hopkins plays Doctor Hannibal Lecter who is in a Mental Institution for murdering many of his patients. Clarice is called upon by the head of Behavioral Science Jack Crawford to go and meet with Lecter and write a report on him. But things start to get a bit more complicated when Lecter gives her information on a case that the FBI have been having trouble with for months. This leads to Clarice following up the hints with events coming to a dramatic conclusion.
Besides the main story line there is strong chemistry between Lecter and Starling from the moment they meet. With Clarice confessing that she thinks about Lecter a lot, and Lecter only talking to her when he is normally very ignorant towards the FBI and other organisations that try to speak with him. This twisted love story seems to mix well with the heart-pounding suspence of the main plot.
""The Silence Of The Lambs"" is a must see movie for anyone who likes thrillers. Now at 13, I understand it more but love it just the same! And the amount of Oscars it won in 1991 proves that it is one of the best films of all time.",1059350400,,1390,4.454901960784314
154783,5,0792842111,"When I was ten years old, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" was released in theaters.  I heard a lot of ""buzz"" about it, therefore heightening my curiosity.  I begged my mom to let me watch it.  She always said ""no"".  It took two years for her to finally say ""yes"".  I rented it that day.  After I watched it, I realized it was worth the wait.
""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a work of genius.  Who knew that a thriller can contain such level of quality?  The writers have a very creative mind as expressed in this movie.  Few other movies can chain an unusual chain of events and an unusual personality and make it fit so perfectly.  It blends with the rest of the movie smoothly.  This movie was well-deserving of all five Oscar wins, including Best Picture.  However, it should have won more.
Anthony Hopkins was terrific in his Oscar winning role as the infamous imprisoned serial killer Hannibal Lector.  This is his best acting in his career.  Jodie Foster was the perfect casting choice for her Oscar winning role as the determined FBI agent-in-training Clarice Starling.  Their chemistry is perfect, even with a glass wall between them.  The role of ""Buffalo Bill"" by Ted Levine is wonderful.
Every scene will keep one watching closely guessing what will happen next.  Therefore, one can watch it everyday for twelve years and still find new reasons to love it.  Though, those who are offended by graphic violence and images may be disturbed by certain scenes.  Those who are not will have no problem discovering why "" The Silence of the Lambs"" will be a classic.  Of the Hannibal Lector trilogy, this is the best.",1058745600,2,1613,4.5929824561403505
154784,5,0792842111,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" about an FBI trainee who is assigned to use knowledge of the insane Dr. Hannibal ""the cannibal"" Lecter to find a serial killer who skins his victims. Actor Anthony Hopkins and actress Jodie Foster made their best appearances in this film. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" which recieved four stars from the critics also earned two spots in AFI's 100 heroes and villains special. The character of Clarice Starling ranked in at number six for heroes as Hannibal Lecter earned first in the villains.
Filmed in 1991, this movie (and novel, by the way) was much better than its sequels. But then again, few movies are able to live up to their predecessors. ""Hannibal"" and the new ""Red Dragon"" have both let the Hannibal Lecter series fall down, making ""The Silence of the Lambs"" less of a movie than it really is.
Every piece of the film is great. There are many people who say the movie is boring or that it has no real plot, or in one of Amazon.com's reviewer, just gore. I won't lie, the hotel scene is a bit violent, but is nothing compared to the ending in ""Hannibal."" But the ending in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a bit gory, the scene inside Bufallo Bill's house.

154788,4,0792842111,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" needs no introduction.  A masterfully told suspense/thriller with a diabolical twist ending, this is the movie that made cannibals cool and reinvented the careers of both Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins is, of course, Hannibal Lecter, the psychiatrist who ate his patients and is serving out a life sentance in a maximum security, clinical facility.  Foster is Clarise Starling, a fledgling FBI agent sent to pick apart Hannibal's mind (no pun intended) when copy cat crimes start surfacing.
MGM's remastering effort of this important movie is nothing short of a revelation.  Both Criterion and Image tried to give us an adequate print.  Neither were anamorphically enhanced and both suffered from insufficient contrast levels, shadow delineation and color separation.  This DVD fixes all of those problems.  The image quality throughout is superb.  Colors are well balance.  Film grain is kept to a minimum.  Edge enhancement, shimmering and aliasing are nonexistant.  The audio has been remixed to 5.1 and is incredibly stirring, especially in its music tracks.
Extras: a really great documentary that, unfortunately does not involve the participation of Jodie Foster (what's with her any way?), some deleted scenes and test footage round out the extras, including bios, theatrical trailers, television spots and an audio commentary track.  Three cheers.  Much better than Criterion's bare bones junket and far less expensive!

154800,5,0792842111,"The ""psychological thriller"" has always been my favorite genre of film making.  Such films are more challenging in that it takes a special cohesiveness between a director, screenwriter, and cast to craft a story that will get inside the viewer's head and stay there days - even weeks - after having seen the film.  Though heavy on the suspense (naturally), most (if not all) of the ""scary stuff"" is implied, which I feel has a much stronger effect on the audience than the average run-of-the-mill fright flick.  ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is one of only two films that I have seen in my lifetime that pulls this off successfully (""The Sixth Sense"" being most recently the second).
Jodie Foster perfectly embodies a young female FBI agent-in-training with a twofold mission: trying to prove herself as a capable agent in taking on the life-and-death task before her while battling her own inner demons at the same time.  To save the life of the next would-be victim of one heinous killer, Clarice has to enlist the assistance of another heinous killer.  With time slowly running out, she has no other choice but to do what her supervisor explicitly warned against - allow Lechter to ""get inside your head.""  How cool is that!
To say that Sir Anthony Hopkins simply ""portrayed"" Hannibal Lechter would be like saying that Michael Jordan is simply a basketball player.  Hopkins BECAME Lechter, evil genius personified!  Hopkins devoured every scene he was in with a combination of creepy brilliance and deliberate, near-surgical precision.
""Silence"" won the top five Academy Awards of 1991 (Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Actor and Actress), and deservedly so.  This is arguably one of the best suspense films ever made.  Period!",1049414400,,1733,5.006968641114983

But when I got the DVD of this film recently, I saw it for at least twenty two times.  I even got second copy and it's still sealed, in mint condition, just in case the other DVD gets damaged.
""Silence of the Lambs"" is one of those rare films that will stay in your mind and in your head for at least a week or more.  This is the scariest, most emotionally affecting film in the Hannibal Lecter trilogy.
You all know the basics of this film. A rookie agent from the FBI is pulled out to ask Dr. Lecter's help for the capture of the brutal, serial killer Buffalo Bill.  In these exchanges, we begin to probe deeper into the character of Clarice Starling, a woman who has her skeletons in the closet that immediately resurfaces once Dr. Lecter dissects her mind.  And in this process, she feels it is her ultimate mission to track down Buffalo Bill so that her lambs will stop screaming.
Jodie Foster is the key to this film, aside of course from, Anthony Hopkins.  I don't know if the film would have been effective if Michelle Pfeiffer agreed to play Starling, but she just draws you so strongly to this masterpiece of a film. There is not a scene in this film where she gives her character such depth.
The key to the success of this film is we are given privy to the world of a woman.  A woman who is doing the work of a man.  As the DVD featurette said, the sexual twist here is that it is a female who is trying to rescue another female.  Thomas Harris is just brilliant.
If you are an avid DVD collector and film buff, it is imperative that you go out and buy this DVD.  And if you are as anal as I am, I would suggest that you buy two copies.  The special features add another two hours to this DVD, and you have to watch ""Inside the Labyrinth"".  You'll know what I mean when you've seen it.",1049241600,2,1896,4.1502732240437155

Hopkins gives a performance of such stunning power that the figure of Hannibal Lector immediately attained pop icon status.  Jonathan Demme's direction, incorporating numerous point-of-view shots, draws us right into the story and keeps the tension building.

Jody Foster is Agent Clarice Starling and she's been assigned to find the mysterious serial killer who calls himself Buffalo Bill.  After doing some research on Buffalo Bill she finds out that he has a connection to imprisoned Dr. Hannibal Lechter (Anthony Hopkins).  She has no choice but to trust the deranged psychologist because she'll need every bit of information she can get from him.
SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is probably my favorite out of the trilogy (SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, HANNIBAL and RED DRAGON).  There isn't as much gore as there is in some other movies but this will creep you out from a psychological stand point.  This movie gets into your head a little and also into the mind of a serial killer.  Hopkins also puts on an outstanding performance as Hannibal Lechter.  He is simply amazing in this role.

Foster talks about how she was intrigued by the feminist aspect of the role of Clarice Starling.

154819,5,0792842111,"This is the quintessential 'serial killer' film that other moviemaker's have been tirelessly attempting to emulate without success.
After viewing it again for the third or fourth time, there are aspects of the film that became prominent - subtle techniques in direction and photography, which has made the film a masterpiece. For example, take a close look at the camera's constant change in perspective: we are able to see the story from each character's point of view, adding to the film's many layers of meaning. From the start, we are introduced to Starling - a vulnerable and intelligent female fighting to compete in a male dominated environment. This, of course, creates an instant empathy for the character, and sets us up for the first terrifying meeting with Hannibal Lecter. We are also permitted to view the world from Hannibal's perspective, looking through the glass cage of his cell at the vulnerable, Clarice. We are also permitted to see the world through the eye's of Buffalo Bill - as he plays-out his fantasies of becoming a beautiful woman in front of the mirror in his home. These techniques in cinematography are meant to hook our attention and submerge our minds into its world. And it works beautifully.
The other significant ingredient in the film that contributed to its massive appeal, both critically and at the box office, was Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hannibal Lecter. I've always been intrigued about Hannibal Lecter's appeal for so many people. What is it about this character that fascinates? He's educated, artistic, has good taste in the finer things in life - wine, music, and literature and exudes a feeling that he is one of those individuals that really knows how to live, and live well. The man has class. However he's also a monster, a killer who enjoys eating his victims. The appeal, I believe, is in the contradiction: we don't associate 'class' with calculated slaughter - it just doesn't make sense. Hopkins's interpretation of this literary character, too, is right on the mark. Hopkins has brought this disturbing character to life with such realism that we can't imagine anyone else as Hannibal Lecter. And any other actor attempting this role in the future would be doomed to failure.
This film won a score of Oscars, including best picture, directer, best actor and best actress. Jodie Foster has always been a pleasure to watch in her many performances over the years. Her performance as Special Agent Starling deserved the Oscar and all the critical acclaim she received.
~Silence of the Lambs~ has to be one of the great films of the twentieth century.

I've read all the books by Harris--RED DRAGON, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, and HANNIBAL. The movie follows closley with the book as Clarice Starling--a fresh and eager FBI agent in the making--is chosen to interview Dr. Lecter in order to extract information regarding Buffalo Bill. The scenes between Starling (JODIE FOSTER) and Hannibal (HOPKINS) are pure magic. There's a reason this movie won a plethora of Academy Awards. The acting is superb and the dialouge and action sequences are excellent. Foster plays a wonderful character and her growth throughout the movie is amazing--from a tedious and reluctant FBI trainee to a fierce and vigorous tracker of a killer. It is quite a shame that she turned down the role for the movie HANNIBAL--Foster did not like the way Starling's character was portrayed at the end of the book--I won't spoil it for you but Starling and Hannibal have somewhat of a romantic trist at the end of HANNIBAL. Obviously if you've seen Hannibal then you are aware of the movie ending that is far different from the book ending.
With the recent release of RED DRAGON a boxset will be forthcoming. If you haven't seen this movie you're missing one of the best films of all time.

And, I also learned that it was remastered in a high-definition 16x9 anamorphic transfer and 5.1 Surround Sound.  So, I finally broke down and purchased this copy.  Plus, I knew that I could still keep my Criterion version, because it had features such as commentary that is unavailable on this version.  Overall verdict: I ended up very happy that I bought this version, because it is far superior to the other two.
Before I get into the DVD aspect of the film, allow me to recap the story for those who are unfamiliar with the story.  I'm sure that number is very small, but I might as well just in case.  Jodie Foster stars as Clarice Starling, an FBI agent in training.  One of her first assignments is to talk to a vicious serial killer, known as Hannibal ""the Cannibal"" Lecter, hoping to get into the mind of a killer to catch another who is on the loose.  But it isn't going to be easy, for Hannibal has an agenda of his own, and he loves to get into the minds of others.  This all adds up to a terrifying and nightmarish thriller that you will never forget.
The acting is outstanding.  Jodie Foster does her part justice in every way.  And Anthony Hopkins is amazing as Hannibal.  Who would've thought that he could play such a terrifying role?  You could tell that he was having fun with it.  The director did a great job of painting us a picture full of darkness, nightmares, and dread.  Ted Tally did a terrific job of writing a script that was very true to the novel (he also returned to write the screenplay for ""Red Dragon"").
And now, for the DVD.  This version of the film is quite an improvement on all different fronts.  The picture is crystal clear and you can swear that you're seeing things you never saw before.  The lightness and darkness is perfect.  The sound is also a big improvement; loud when it's supposed to be and quiet when it's supposed to be.  There are many special features, which include a brand new documentary that includes new interviews with the cast and crew, 20 minutes of deleted scenes, the original 1991 ""Making of"" featurette, an outtake reel, trailers, and many more where that came from.  I really enjoyed watching the documentary and interviews; especially the new ones made specifically for the DVD.  They are really interesting.  But I really enjoyed all of the special features.  (Just remember if you have the Criterion version, keep it, since this newer version does not include commentary from the cast and crew.)
So, I was very happy to finally break down and buy this new and improved version of an ultimate and frightening classic, ""The Silence of the Lambs.""  It still remains as one of my favorites (would have to be if I bought the movie three times!).  If this is one of your favorites as well, then I recommend getting it.  It is really a big improvement in many different ways.
Oh yeah, if you've never seen the movie, don't go in expecting a horror movie.  A lot of people have been saying it's a good movie but it's a bad horror film.  I really do not consider this a horror movie.  I think of it more as a dark thriller.  When I think of ""horror,"" I think of all of the Freddy and Jason movies.  Then again, that's just me.",1035676800,2,3864,4.457917261055635
154823,5,0792842111,"A surprise hit at the box office, Jonathan Demme's psycological thriller is as good as a horror film can get!  ""The Silence of the Lambs"" came out in 1991, when it seemed like movies shifted back and forth between kookie freakshows(Children of the Corn)and prepackaged action flicks(Terminater 2).  In this climate, ""Silence"" was like a breath of fresh air to thriller fans looking for something with a little more substance.  The film actually contains only one really graphic scene.  Most of the horror is created by the uncertainty and suspense in the plot, as well as some mighty fine acting(Anthony Hopkins take a bow).  The script focuses on two vicious and mysterious criminals, both very volatile, yet with very different psyches.  The films' daring turns and twists continue all the way to its climax when the FBI agent (Jodie Foster) and the wanted serial killer (Ted Levine) meet face to face almost by pure chance!  More interesting than this, however, is Foster's dialogue scenes with the imprisoned madman, Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins).  Well, I won't go on with all the details and spoil it for you, so I just say this:  If you like suspence-filled thrillers that make you think, buy this movie today.  It is one of the best of all-time in its genre!

In most movies before this, Clarice Starling's character would be a man.  This movie is also an acting and directing masterpiece.  From watching this movie, you can tell that without Johnathan Demme's masterful direction that this movie would not be have as good without it.  As far as the acting is concerned, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins both give performances that will be two of the most memorable in film ever.  Hopkins can not get enough praise for what he has done in this movie.  If you enjoy scary movies and psychological thrillers, this is an undeniable classic.",1035331200,,725,4.5813953488372094
154825,5,0792842111,"Nothing is more frightening than real life.
Shortly after ""the Silence of the Lambs"" was released theatrically, we were confronted with the news reports of Jeffrey Dahmer's crimes. Suddenly Buffalo Bill's nightmarish behavior didn't seem so far-fetched; the film didn't have to work as hard create some terrible creature to frighten us.
Unfortunately, it's nearly impossible to go back to a time when Hannibal Lecter/Anthony Hopkins was subversive and menacing. He's become such a cult-antihero caricature of himself that he may never again send a shiver down your spine--it's too easy to root for him, instead. Back in the day, though, his controlled, winking evil kept the tone of the film unsettling; even the heroine's ALLIES were threats.
Thankfully, the whole of the film is strong enough to preserve its quality in spite of its own overexposure. Even without Hannibal Lecter, the film would have been harrowing. Lecter merely gives us the willies; Jame Gumb (played by Ted Levine) scares the pants off us. A few well-constructed twists keep us from getting too comfortable, and you'll be afraid to go in your own basement after seeing Jame Gumb stalk Clarice Starling in his.
DVD favors this movie quite well--the moody lighting benefits from the crisp presentation. The cinematography perfectly complements Hopkins' performance, underscoring his malevolent gazes.

Dr. Lecter says that he will give information if Clarice will give information about her own complicated life. The Silence of The Lambs was one of three movies to get the most Academy Awards(the others were One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and It Happend One Night).

154827,5,0792842111,"The Silence of the Lambs (1991) was truly a magnificent movie.  This film combined an excellent plot, excellent acting, wonderful directing, and a very dark musical score to make it more than the regular suspense/thriller genre that one is accustomed to.  All of the Oscars won by this film, its director, its actors and actress were all well deserving.
Director Jonathan Demme does a wonderful job of portraying this movie based on Thomas Harris' novel.  Demme keeps the gore at a bare minimum, only focussing on two stomach churning scenes.  One involving an autopsy, the other a prision escape.
The film follows Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), a very determined FBI agent in training.  Starling is sent in to the  criminal asylum to try to persuade Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to fill out a questionaire about serial killers.  Starling is very focused throughout the movie, but somehow she misses the true intentions on sending her to see Lecter.  Lecter offers to help Starling with the ""Buffalo Bill"" (Ted Levine) case, in exchange for information from her about painful childhood memories.  Every time Starling feeds Lecter a piece of her past he gives her a clue needed to help catch Buffalo Bill.  Starling uses her new information to carry on with the investigation of Bill, all the while trying to acheive her ultimate goal of becoming a FBI agent in the Behavior Science Division.
History shows films that win Oscars for Best Picture usually become a Classic.  I feel that in twenty or thirty years this film will be no exception, and it will be listed with some of the most popular classics of our time.
I rated this film 5 stars because it is a film in its own genre.  I have yet to experience another film with its magnitude.  I strongly encourage all film viewers who enjoy a strong suspense/thriller to watch this film.",1034467200,2,1846,4.822222222222222

I don't know what in the world audiences and critics found terryfying or tense about this borefest, but I wasn't impressed the least.  One of the first problems is the director, John Demme.  This man couldn't direct a scene to save his life.  Many scenes seem uneven and look like they only took one take.  All the scenes look dark, dirty, and cloudy.
The second problem is the acting.  Jodie Foster gives a southern accent a good try, but lets not fool ourselves.  Then there is everyone's favorite, Hannibal Lector.  When he talks to Jodie, he stares at her with INTENSE EYES.  I'm really scared now!!  The third problem is the story.  Hannibal's escape is really shocking...Really shocking in that it was so ridiculous, so implausable, I found myself gaping at the screen in disbelief.",1034467200,7,874,4.684210526315789

But when I came out I knew I just saw one of the classic Horror movies ever made. With the best movie villain I had ever seen, Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal(the cannabal)Lecter. What Hopkins did with minimal movement and a stare, hasn't ever been done in a movie before. He had less then 30 min. of screen time, but Lecter is what sticks with you about the film. Jodie Foster gives a great proformance as FBI agent in-training, Clarice Starling. Which I feel was the model for Dana Scully on the X-Files. The relationship that builds between Lecter and Starling is at the heart of the movie. I am a real mood and atmosphere person, that is one of the things I notice when I watch a movie. Silence has the creepiest mood I have ever felt in a movie. The movie deals with fears and it lets you use your imagination while watching. I never get tired of watching this movie, I can watch it as though I had never seen it before, It still scares the Hell out of me.
BTW: I feel Anthony Perkins proformance/character in Psycho is equal to Hopkins, In Silence of the Lambs, it is just Hannibal gets under my skin more then Norman.",1034294400,,1288,4.3264462809917354

Well, I'm glad to say that nothing jumped out at the viewer and the gore was necessary to the plot and limited.  The movie was well done, and the acting was very good.  But why was everyone CRAZY about this film?  I give it a solid 3 stars, which is to say above average, but it must have been an off year for the film industry if this was the best thing they turned out that year.
Anthony Hopkins is one of my favorite actors, but I don't think this is a role that ""only he could play.""  The same could be said for Jodie Foster's performance.  As for the writing, this is supposed to be a psychological thriller.  Clarice is warned over and over not to let Dr. Lechter ""get into her head.""  He asked a bunch of questions about her painful past.  She answered them honestly.  Yeah.  So?

154841,5,0792842111,"When I first saw this movie in 1991, I realized that I had just witnessed a fine piece of film that will no doubt go down as one of the finest thrillers ever made. When the movie went on to win all of the major Oscar awards, it was nice to see that the industry thought so too. After the pleasant, but non-distinguishable ""Manhunter"" 5 years previous, the unsuspecting audience finally got to see Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter in a way he was meant to be seen. The movie was directed by Joonathan Demme, and was based on the book by Thomas Harris. The film follows Clarice Starling, an FBI agent in traning, who is played by Jodie Foster. She is brought in on a case involving a serial killer known as Buffalo Bill. He is a dangerous psychopath who has killed numerous women. To help track him down, Starling must go to see Hannibal Lecter who might be able to help her track the killer down. Although Brian Cox did an admirable job as Lecter in ""Manhunter"", Anthony Hopkins really brings the character to life. It is his character. No one can touch him or his performance. The cold stare and the diabolical grin and winking. Just knowing who he is and what he has done only makes the charmingness all the more creepy and frightening. Hopkins does it with ease and grace, and never goes overboard. He makes Lecter real. And there is nothing scarier than when something comes across as real. The same could be said for Foster. We all know she is a phenomenal actress, and she proves it again with this performance. We connect with Agent Starling. We want her to win and catch the bad guy. That same feeling could not be acheived with Julianne Moore in the role in ""Hannibal"". Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill, is a one man creepshow. Just as eerie and creepy as Tom Noonan in ""Manhunter"". His voice could send chills up anyone's spine. The direction is top notch. The writing is intelligent and clever, and is way above most other thriller screenwriters' heads. Big credit goes to Ted Tally for writing an impeccable script. The movie is a real thriller. It is what a thriller should be. Not overly gory, but more to do with the people and the situation. Plus, you don't usually get classic, memorable characters like this in most films. It's a movie for people who love movies. Love 'real' thrillers. Unless, of course, you are the one who wrote the review below saying how hilarious the movie was and basically showcasing your inability to access intelligence. The follow up, ""Hannibal"", was nicely done, but a huge disappointment nonetheless.

154842,5,0792842111,"Oscar-winning director Jonathan Demme and screenwriter Ted Tally(they won the gongs for this movie and deservedly so) achieved what, in Hollywood, is pretty much the impossible.  They took an excellent book, turned this excellent book into a fantastic film, and, along with Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster, has spent the last decade knowing that this remarkable film is now a classic.
The story begins stylishly and gracefully, introducing viewers to FBI agent-in-training, Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster).  Ambitious and intelligent, FBI Special Agent Jack Crawford, who is head of the Behavioural Sciences Profiling Unit, requests that she conduct an interview with eminent psychiatrist and convict serial killer Dr ""Hannibal The Cannibal"" Lecter.  (In reality, of course, a trainee G-Person would NEVER be asked to do this).
But I digress.  The film REALLY begins with Starling and the monstrous Lecter's initial encounter.  Lecter, while definitely imprisoned in a heavily guarded cell, still manages to ooze malevolence out of every pore.  He can't get at Starling, can't POSSIBLY get at her - at least our logic dictates this to us - but we are always fully aware of his dangerousness and like the intrepid Clarice, we want to get the hell away from him as quickly as possible.  But Lecter won't allow that.  He is intent on delving into the bourrows of Starling's psyche, unearthing and unravelling her deepest secrets, fears, and memories of her unsettled childhood.  The tradeoff?  He MIGHT help the police and the FBI capture another brutal serial killer who has been nicknamed ""Buffalo Bill"" (he was given this moniker because ""he likes to skin his humps."").  This is a surreal world made even more evil and nightmarish by the fact that such people do exist and such things do happen, it's no use pretending that they don't, and there is no way out for the viewers once they begin watching.  Yes, there are a few gory scenes, but the implied wickedness, the spine-tingling suspense, and the electrifying, terrifying chemistry between the two leads will keep you on the edge of your seat (or as in my case when I saw this movie at the cinema, BEHIND your seat).
Along with the 1960 scare-ama ""Psycho"", ""The Silence Of The Lambs"" is the best suspense/thriller movie ever made.  It features a clever blend of modern fears and ancient curses, along with two superb, deservedly Oscar-winning performances of a lifetime (and in the history of motion pictures, in my opinion) by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster.",1032134400,6,2517,5.050724637681159

Silence of The Lambs is a gripper. It grabs us by the throat and doesn't let us go until the final scene.
Nobody, but NOBODY could have played FBI agent Clarice Starling like our beloved Jodie Foster. A superb performance by a superb actress. Excellent! You will follow her anywhere she needs to go. Even into the subterranean prison to visit Dr. Hanabel Lecter. You'll be scared. You'll be reluctant. But you wouldn't dream of letting Clarice go alone.
Anthony Hopkins' performance of Dr. Lecter is absolutely chilling. Very believable. You'll swear that Anthony Hopkins really IS a deranged psychiatrist, who is also a canibal. Dr. Lecter is the most frightening character I've ever seen! And nobody could have done a better, scarier, or more chilling portrayal than Sir Anthony Hopkins, an actor extraordinaire! His ""Well, hello Clarice"" makes the hair on my head stand up every time I watch the film.

While I won't go into too much plot detail, I will say that this movie is a masterpiece...If you go into this movie thinking you're in for a scare and nightmares for a week, you're not going to like it. Silence isn't one of those kind of movies. What makes this movie so good is the superb acting, and the enjoyable story. While it can be gruesome and scary, that's not entirely what it is. There are also several quotes from the movie that you'll be saying to your friends for weeks, such as ""I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti"" and ""I do wish we could chat longer but I'm having an old friend for dinner."" Thanks to one reviewer, I learned of a prequel called Manhunter made in 1986. I haven't seen it yet, but I want to. I figure that it won't be as good as Silence (since I read the reviews) but I hope it'll at least get the job done, which is filling in the missing story gaps. I wish that Hopkins were in Manhunter, but unfortunately he isn't. If you're thinking about seeing this movie, know a few things first. This movie is rated R for occasional profanity, violence, gore, and slight nudity. Also be aware that after seeing this movie, you'll be hooked instantly. I know for a fact that after renting this, I am definately buying it, along with Manhunter and Hannibal, neither of which I have seen... yet. If you are going to buy the DVD, I suggest the Special Edition because I rented the regular widescreen edition and the speech and music tracks are not balanced. Often music gets much louder than the characters. However, this could be my combination of TV and DVD player, but I use some good quality equipment. Hopefully this is cleared up and remastered in the Special Edition. Again, I will say that this is a great movie, but what would you expect from a movie with all of the awards it's won? Best Actor/Actress, Best Film, to name a few.

One is the story of a serial killer who is kidnapping women and eluding authorities. One is the story of an FBI trainee who only wants to make it to FBI status. One, and perhaps the most chilling and complex of the three, is the story of a highly intellectual man with a taste for human flesh, kept hidden from the world until it becomes evident that he may have a way of helping the trainee discover the whereabouts of the killer.
Adapted from the novel by Thomas Harris, the film is a cauldron of mixed emotions that the audience will feel in every chilling moment. Jonathan Demme has created a masterpiece of the mind as well as a chilling thriller to jangle the nerves until the final, climactic ending.
When FBI trainee Clarice Starling is called upon to question Hannibal Lector, she readily accepts the mission in hopes of impressing her superiors. When she arrives at the asylum where he is held, the head of the facility heavily warns her about Lector's crimes: killing people and eating the flesh of his victims. When she comes face-to-face with Hannibal, she learns that he is more than a monster: he is an intellectual machine with a flair for large words and turning colorful phrases. He ultimately lends clues to Clarice in exchange for information about the case, and soon for information about her personal life, hoping to dive into the depths of her mind. Clarice hesitates, but gives him what he wants in order to get closer to solving the crime before the next victim is killed.
This film is such a masterpiece in terms of horror and suspense. This is not one of the average run-of-the-mill scare machines that comes along almost every year. This movie is so much more complex, so complex that it can be frightening. Among some of the factors that will have you feeling chills are the way in Clarice regails the experiences of her childhood to Hannibal, which is so depressing and emotional that you feel for her. She appears so broken that it looks as if she is reliving the entire experience, while at the same time keeping the one goal in mind to find the serial killer at large.
The most frightening of all is the way in which Hannibal is portrayed. Perhaps one of the most unique villians in all of Hollywood, the best part of his character is that the movie and novel do not play him out as a lunatic, but instead as a highly intelligent psychologist whose only crime is that of cannibalism. In the end, it's not so much the actions of his past that are frightening as much as the ability he has to get into Clarice's mind and dredge up horrifying memories from her past, all the while focusing his eyes only on her eyes, seemingly peering inside her very soul.
The outside story is filled with mounting suspense as the FBI closes in on the killer named Buffalo Bill, who skins his victims of their flesh in order to achieve something more chilling. Hannibal is able to offer information to the authorities as to the background of the man who they suspect is the killer, and the way in which he offers his information is quite suspenseful. It becomes evident that Clarice is going to be the one who finds the killer because of her relationship and communication with Lector. We find that he has a deep emotional attachment to her because of what she tells him about her past, and you'll find that to be one of the most intense realizations of the movie.
The two leads both won Academy Awards for their performances in this picture, and it's quite easy to see why. Jodie Foster is remarkable and stunning as Clarice Starling, who is innocent in the beginning and becomes swept up in emotional trauma and stress as she allows Lector to question her about her past. Her performance here is intense and true. Anthony Hopkins is masterful as Hannibal Lector, and his performance here is the entire centerpiece for the suspense of the film. Hopkins plays every aspect of Lector's persona to perfection, a great achievement in his acting career.
Winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a complex and stunning tale that dives deep into the minds of its characters and goes straight to the mind of its audiences. Expectations are sure to be met, for the movie has everything you could want: intelligence, thrills, chills, scares, action, emotion, and complexity. You'll find yourself waking up in the middle of the night, seeing the eyes of Hannibal Lector looking straight at you...

154882,5,0792842111,"Every so often there is a movie that really makes you sit up and take notice, something that restores your faith in the entire genre.  'Silence Of The Lambs' is just one of those movies, earning cult status and getting numerous awards.  It's an undeniably tense thriller that follows Clarice Starling (Foster) as she trails a serial killer nicknamed 'Buffalo Bill', who has kidnapped a senator's daughter and murdered several before her.  When all leads seem to have dried up she turns to Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lectre (Hopkins), a dangerous serial killer and psychologist who Buffalo Bill has been writing to for help.  However, he'll only give Clarice information if she'll talk about herself, her career and her upbringing.
It's not so much the story that is groundbreaking here rather than the way in which it mounts up tension so precisely.  Whilst there are admitedly several violent scenes here it will be the meetings between Clarice and Hannibal that will really make your hair stand on end.  Foster and Hopkins give the performances of their career as a young officer eager to impress and an eloquent killer respectively.  There are no characters that fail to make an impression and this is perhaps the movie's strongest point in that all its characters have become so instantly recognisable in movie lore.
With its gritty and compelling photography, 'Silence Of The Lambs' is very different to both its prequel 'Manhunter' and the much glossier 'Hannibal'.  It is often regarded as one of the best thriller/horror movies ever made, and rightly so.  Not only is it scary but it's also gripping and intelligent.  It is a memorable movie that impresses on every level.",1014249600,,1677,4.978494623655914
154883,4,0792842111,"This review will only talk about the features included on this DVD.  My review of the movie proper was posted January 29, 2001.
---
The commentary track, a joint effort by five voices, is this edition's centrepiece.  Each voice offers a different, and vital, perspective on the film.
Jodie Foster appears calculating and determined, in both the notion that Clarice Starling fits in with her career goals of playing new-heroines, and in getting Clarice just right.  Her opening description of why she campaigned hard for the role, because it fit in nicely with mythical male hero roles, shines a new light on Clarice.  Foster is erudite and didactic, giving varied enough details to satisfy those with an interest in the minutiae of the actor's choices and those with an interest in how a character fits into a story, like a piece of a puzzle.
Jonathan Demme is probably the most interesting to listen to.  As a director, he'd have his hands in the most pots, so that only naturally follows suit.  But Demme comes across as not only a learned and experienced director, but also as a fan.  He candidly admits that with this project he had no interest in forcing his own views and themes on the story, because the source material was so appealing to him and so fully formed, that he might just ruin it if he tried.  He has a lot of fun pointing out odd and fun casting choices (his quick commendation of Ted Tally's 1-second cameo is priceless; see also his joy at seeing Charles Napier, Roger Corman, and George Romero on screen), poking fun at cinematographer Tak Fujimoto's obsession for detail, and wondering if the subtle clues he's inserted were missed by the audience.  He's a treat to listen to.
Anthony Hopkins comes across as quite a sad and lonely man, but one who's content to be sad and lonely.  Apparently the genesis of how he'd play Hannibal Lecter came during one of his many cross-country solo road trips.  His insights into how he created this character are astounding.  Would you have thought to model Dr. Lecter on HAL 9000?  Tony does.  He also points out whose idea it was to have Lecter standing in the middle of the cell the first time we (and Clarice) see him, why he's looking away when Clarice tells the story of her childhood, and why he wore clinical white in his final scenes.  Hopkins relishes being known as Hannibal Lecter; his affection for the character comes across nicely here.
Screenwriter Ted Tally appears quite sour on the whole experience.  He never comes out and says so, but you get the impression that he meant ""Silence"" to be a different movie altogether.  Tally, a tortured artists / playwright by trade, may be disappointed by its genre-busting success.  Still, his insights on how the screenplay is structured, how he and Demme worked together, and how the book and movie differ are invaluable.
John Douglas, the G-man on whom Scott Glenn's character is based, gives wonderful insight into how the FBI's Behavioral Science unit works.  At times, though, he can't help himself, offering up some pro-death penalty propaganda (he was preaching to the choir with me; others who may have a more liberal bent on this issue may take offence).  But he's just doing his job, which is to rid the civilized world of serial killers.
The rest of the package is substandard.  The deleted scenes are only interesting in that they show how Demme and his editor could spot a turkey when they saw one.  None of the scenes would have added anything to the film (then why are they included here?  Are they anything more than a curiosity?), and some are just uncomfortable to watch, full of cliches and clunky acting.  The storyboards included are mildly amusing, showing how each sequence developed, from a germ of a thought through conception.
The FBI crime classification manual and the Voices of Death sections had a lot of potential, none of it realized.  The former, compiled by John Douglas, is a dry enunciation of the way his unit does business, including some anecdotal examples.  The latter, from a book called ""Serial Slaughter"" gives voice to actual serial killers.  They speak on the subjects of life, sex, murder, and death.  Well, they don't speak, really.  The problem with these two sections is that they consist of just page after page of dry text.  If I wanted to read, I'd get a book.  I don't want to read my DVDs.  Maybe some stylized graphics or sound effects would have helped, or, better yet, include dramatic readings done by the cast and crew.  Otherwise, these features were a snore.
For the lucid and luxurious audio commentary alone this DVD is worth the price.  The rest of the features proved mildly disappointing.",1013472000,6,4673,4.742574257425742
154884,5,0792842111,"The Silence of the lambs is an exellent suspensful horror thriller. Dr. Hannibal Lecter is defenetely the most interesting and scariest character in film history. The novelist (Thomas Harris) and directer (Jonathan Demme) are both genuises. The way they came up with the clues that Dr. Lecter Gave Agent Clarice Starling still eludes me. I do however feel sorry for the character of Buffalo Bill the movie is suppossed to be about him after all and every one only remembers the half hour or so that featured Hannibal Lecter. If you have never seen the movie before after watching it you will be so overwhelmed that by the credits you will have to sit and think a minute just to take it all in. I'm not shor about everyonelse,but the only reason this movie is great is because of Antony Hopkins's Hannibal Lecter. His raspy voice simply makes the movie. His eyes and facial expresions alone will make you put a pillow over your face. What not many people no is that The silence of the Lambs is not a first movie it is much more popular than it's preddesesor Manhunter(1986)  which I have never seen and don't intend to see for the simple reason reason that Anthony Hopkins is not Hannibal Lecer the role is performed by Brian Cox. The jail break seen will keep you awake for nights, but don't worry those who don't like blood their is barely any in this film it is just psychologicly scary. This is a top notch film and I would recomend it to anyone,and if your a census taker their may be a line that troubles you.

Foster's performance was duly noted by the Academy, as was mr. Hopkin's. i believe this was the last movie to sweep the Academys' top five categories: picture; director; actor; actress; screenplay [ from another medium ]. there is also an original screenplay category for which this movie did not qualify.

Buffalo Bill's latest captive victim is a senator's daughter named Catherine (Brooke Smith) and now Clarice must find the sick freak before it's too late.

A brilliant psychological thriller that probes into the minds of viewers ever since it's release. Based on the same book by Thomas Harris, this is a great movie that combines horror with some gory violence, fantastic performances and intelligence. Hannibal Lector became a household name thanks to this movie, but this wasn't the first movie with him in it but in fact it was 1986's ""Manhunter"" that introduced Hannibal Lector before Anthony Hopkins played the role. It's a cold, cruel and thrilling motion picture from Jonathan Demme that won the 1992 academy awards for best picture and it's score by Howard Shore is excellent as well, it's a class act masterpiece.

This 2-Disc DVD offers excellent picture and sound. The extras are terrific such as ""Inside The Labyrinth: Silence of the Lambs"" Documentary with interviews with the cast and crew, deleted scenes, original 1991 making of featurette, Hannibal Lector phone message, Outtake reel, 2-part ""From Page to Screen"" documentary, photo gallery, trailer and TV Spots.",1010534400,,1493,5.2426778242677825

Since so many reviews have been written on this movie, I just want to add one little comment: Jodie Foster was quite right when she chose not to reappear in the sequel ""Hannibal"". In doing so, she actually proved to be as smart as Claridge Starling herself. Too bad Anthony Hopkins couldn't resist the temptation. So Hollywood lost the second battle but still won the war: ""Silence of the Lambs"" remains the best. Let's pray they don't make a sequel to ""The Sixth Sense"".",1010534400,,685,4.669421487603306

  Lambs is a brilliant, chilling film, fueled by a great source novel (by Thomas Harris), great acting and great directing. I love the movie, the DVD transfer looks and sounds great, so lets concern ourselves with the extras, OK?
  The DVD comes with 20+ minutes of deleted scenes, most of which add absolutely nothing, but a few are quite interesting, particularly Jack crawford's verbal sparring with a Johns-Hopkin's Doctor over the release of patient files, and a few more scenes of F.B.I. Agent Krendler, before he became dinner in Hannibal. There are a few minutes of funny outtakes, a large picture gallery, the 1991 ""Making-of"", and a brand-new hour-long documentary, that unfortunately doesn't feature Jodie Foster or Johnathan Demme. It is very interesting, and provided a lot of new information on the early goings-on, such as Gene Hackman being slated to Direct and Star in the film. Another cool goodie is a message from Anthony Hopkins, in character as Hannibal, that you can put on your answering machine.

Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster work of each others talents when they are both onscreen to give the audience real frights, by just having a conversation! That is true cinematic genius, which Jonathan Demme was able to capture.
The Collector's Edition DVD has great material into the making of the film, with some insightful interviews with Foster and Hopkins.

But this DVD gave me a new experience, I had only seen the film on TV and on a extremely bad and old VHS tape I rented, but nevertheless, I though it was great. But when I saw DVD, I could not have been more amazed, the sound is impecable, the image is very good taking account the age of this film and the use it has got, but the image is great, just some few tiny scratches on the opening title. And the especial fetures are great also. The deleted scenes, although the have awful image, they are still great. The phone message of Hannibal, I mean Anthony Hopkins is hilarious, but the best is the new documentary, I have seen it many times and every time I find it interesting. The thing I loved also and found strage is that although it has a lot of special fetures, it is only one disc, thanks MGM for that favour.

And to most, the Criterion Edition, which is no longer in print, is the must-own version of this classic on DVD.....or is it? I bought this edition recently & I got to tell you, I like it better by MGM! First of all, the Criterion wasn't in 5.1 audio while this one is! To audiophiles, that 5.1 is a must. Second, the picture is much brighter & more colorful compared to the Crit. And third, it has more extras than the Crit version (sure, it doesn't have the ""Serial Killers"" biography, but does that really pertain to this film directly?). This one has the original 1991 ""Making-Of"" featurette, but it also has the NEW reflective ""Inside The Labyrinth"" documentary with new interviews & for you ""Serial"" fans, it contains many photos from that missing unrelated biography mentioned earlier. Also, it has a neat little feature ""The Anthony Hopkins' Phone Message"", which sounds great on anybody's answering machine, trust me. It also contains many features that the Crit had too, like the 20 minutes of deleted scenes, film photo gallery, all the teasers and trailers (including one for ""Hannibal""-Crit didn't have that one!), and a very eerie menu totally different from the Crit as well. I guess what I'm saying is, ""Why go to an on-line auction website and pay over a hundred dollars for an out-of-date version of the film, when you can get a just-as-good version for under thirty?"". It makes sense to me to buy the latter, unless of course you're an obsessed DVD collector or must own every DVD version of a certain film (I can't talk though, I personally own BOTH versions of ""This Is Spinal Tap"", but the extras are greatly different on both versions). Save your money and get your Lambs at Chickens prices!
 Oh yeah, one more thing: You might notice this review is for the ""FULLSCREEN"" Special Edition, rather than the also availble ""Widescreen"" version. Yes, I did buy the fullscreen one. The reason why I did is because I currently own about 120 DVD's & maybe five of them is fullscreen, so why not a change of pace? And it really shows off the colors on this Pan & Scan version too! Don't worry though, all of the supplement features completely match on both MGM Lambs versions. And it seems that more copies of the ""Wide"" are being made than the ""Full"", hmmm could that mean that the ""Full"" could become the collectors version in the future? We'll see.

(Hopkins's portrayal of the unimaginably brilliant but unspeakably evil Dr. Hannibal Lecter is arguably one of the most memorable performances in film history).

The first scene between Lecter and Jody Foster's ambitious but green FBI agent Clarice Starling in which Clarice tries to get Lecter to help in the FBI's search for a serial killer dubbed Buffalo Bill is a movie classic.  Mr. Hopkins and Ms. Foster create a dramatic tension as the brilliant but deranged Lecter psychoanalyzes Clarice.  Ms. Foster's facial reactions to Lecter's analysis convey so much more than words.  The movie is a psychological thriller that provides chills, tension and scares you while avoiding tired cliches.  In addition to Mr. Hopkins and Ms. Foster, Ted Levine is scary as the twisted killer Buffalo Bill and Scott Glenn is icy as Clarice's commanding officer. Director Jonathan Demme strikes all right notes and the filming of the closing scene in Buffalo Bill's basement is superbly filmed.

154907,2,0792842111,"Despite some truly wonderful performances and a solid plot, this film never quite takes off. I am truly angered at how overrated this actually is. Really. It is just a typical cop versus serial killer film. Jodi Foster, Anthony Hopkins, and Ted Levine as the psychopath give some truly chilling performances, and Roger Corman has a nice cameo as the FBI director, but this film is definitely not as special as people make it to be. The character of Hannibal Lecter is a great one, and he has some terrific one liners, and despite a few suspenseful moments, this film is very boring. It is exactly like many other serial killer films out there, so what's with all the special attention? It's average film making at best. I do realize that many people will disagree with me, but I really didn't see what all the fuss was about. This movie didn't even make me jump once. It did have it's high points, such as the particularly creepy killer and of course, the immortal Hannibal Lecter, but I was just so bored throughout the whole thing and couldn't understand what was behind all the hype as I sat watching. This is certainly not the greatest modern horror film. The ending didn't even deliver the punch I was so expecting and after sitting through this, I was very disappointed. For a similar subject and a better movie, I suggest ""Kiss The Girls""",1001376000,6,1345,4.608333333333333
154908,4,0792842111,"Don't get me wrong, I love this DVD. No-one who appreciates fine acting can view the tet-a-tet exchanges between Dr. Hannibal Lecter and FBI Agent Clarice Starling without at least one shiver of delight... and terror. And though much is made of Tony Hopkins chilling brilliance as the insane Lecter, this is just as much Jodie Foster's show. I'm very glad she was awarded an Oscar, especially since the Academy seems so shy of awarding mulitiple statuettes to the same actor, regardless of how superior their work is. (wow, that was run-on)
But back to my gripe, if it can be called a gripe. I've counted four separate versions of the Silence of the Lambs on DVD: Criterion collection, standard edtion, special edition, and widescreen special edition. And all (save the standard ...) have extremely desirable features. Why not combine them for one phenomenal DVD presentation? The film deserves no less? I guess it's too late, and we'll all have to buy the Criterion (if we can find it) for the juicy commentary, and the widescreen special edition for the ideal viewing format, and the fascinating outtakes and deleted scenes. Ah well...
I cannot give this DVD the five stars I so long to award anything connected with Silence. I must advise you, instead, to go for the widescreen special edition, and grab the Criterion while you're at it. But if you don't care about the extras, or the format, and you aren't averse to intense depictions of criminal mania, and the actions of law-enforcement to curb that mania, by all means, buy this immediately. You will not regret it. In fact, you'll probably be stuck, like me, eyes glued to the screen, shivering uncontrollably as Dr. Hannibal Lecter requests (demands?) every so playfully, ""Closer, please!""

If you missed things from watching the movie, the deleted scenes totally elaborate things for you! There are even outtakes which alone are pretty funny, especially when everyone is so serious in the movie. There is even an answering machine message from Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal that is chilling. As for the alternate ending, um... boring... I will ruin it for everyone, it's still a phone call to Clarice only with a riddle as to where Hannibal is.

With a serial killer named ""Buffalo Bill"" on the loose, The FBI sends rookie agent Clarice Starling (played superbly by Jodie Foster) to ask convicted serial killer Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter (played with frightening intensity by Anthony Hopkins) for some insights on how to capture ""Buffalo Bill"" (Ted Levine in a disturbing performance). However, Hannibal plays a deadly cat & mouse game with Starling & eventually gets inside her head. With Hannibal inside her consciousness, Starling's world will never be the same.

154911,4,0792842111,"I'm glad that the studio that owns this movie went back on its decision to never release this movie to DVD again.
Silence of the Lambs is a very good movie, though not as good as some people have said. Some ideas and scenes in this movie could have used a bit of explination in this film (in other words, shoot a few scenes explaining why something happened instead of just showing it) Hannibal Lecter is quite possibly one of the coolest villans (if you really can call him that) in movie history. He's exceedingly intelligent, and he flaunts it. He doesn't just cooperate with Clarise Starling, he makes her think and figure things out for herself. He's also very good at playing mind games that make the movie far more interesting to watch.  I'm a somewhat fan of Jodie Foster, and her character in this movie was well suited to her, although I found the pseudo-southern accent somewhat irritating at times.
The Silence Of The Lambs is by far better than its sequal, Hannibal, and is a good movie that most will enjoy.",999475200,,1021,4.548913043478261
154912,5,0792842111,"When I first saw ""Silence of the Lambs"" (and subsequently throughout the years since it's release), I was amazed at how smartly this film was put together. The idea of a woman (in this case, Jodie Foster) working in a male-oriented field (somewhat rare a decade ago) just adds more tension to the matter of hunting down a vicious serial killer (especially in the climatic sequence). The conversations between Starling and Lecter (a brillant and chilling Anthony Hopkins) were filmed so tightly that it seemed there was no background around them, which made the scenes even more tense than they should have been. The physical violence committed in this film is kept literally near the last hour of the film (excluding of course, numerous crime scene photos and an autopsy to boot), and when it happens, it's done in a rather surprising way. Lecter's escape (and methods to do so) is the more scary because even when we think we know how it's going to happen, we get the rug pulled out from under us. Good thrillers know when to keep us waiting and when to pounce and go for the jugular, and like Hannibal Lecter, ""Silence"" knows when it's the right time to do it. The new Special Edition DVD has some interesting extras, including an hour-long documentary explaining the origins and filming of the movie (a very detailed and welcomed bonus), deleted scenes, and a rather short blooper reel (not to reveal too much, but let's just say Hopkins may have a career in impersonations open for him). Very few thrillers leave a heavy impact on pop culture like ""Silence"" has, and despite the obvious synchronicty of this re-release and the DVD relase of ""Hannibal"" (not really a ""sequel"" in the traditional sense of the word), this is a definite must-own for those film lovers who like to see their movies with the lights turned down, and their doors bolted shut...",999388800,,1856,4.74922600619195
154913,5,0792842111,"I revisited this film last night after having just watched the recent Hannibal a few days ago. The viewing helped me to remember just how great this film is and it also helped to show just what Hannibal was missing.
Silence of the Lambs is one of the most shocking, exciting, suspenseful and tense movies ever released. It pulls no punches from Thomas Harris novel (unlike Manhunter) and is a very stark, unrelenting film. It is easily top of the heap for the suspense or psychological thriller genre and upon a viewing it is easy to see why. The film possesses so many great qualities at the hands of the director and his actors that is a true standout.
The film itself is about a FBI trainee by the name of Clarice Starling who has been assigned to interview renowned psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lector. She soon finds herself swept up in the case of a lifetime as the FBI attempts to track down active serial killer Buffalo Bill. It is a wonderful story that has more to it than most serial killer movies because aside from the cops vs. serial killer aspect of the story it has a whole other subplot with the Hannibal Lector character. Two serial killers are better than one.
The acting is the best part of the film and while Anthony Hopkins has received much praise for his brilliant portrayal of Lector I feel that Jodie Fosters performance is the best in the film and one of the greatest performances ever to be put on celluloid. I don't think I breathed once while she was on the screen and every word she says is unbelievably powerful. The scene where she talks about the lamb is one of the finest monologues ever. Her and Hopkins performances help to create this great sexual tension which surrounds the film and helps to create its great feel.
Jonathon Demmes directing is perfect. Its as simple as that. He creates an atmosphere of true grit and of stark realism. Every shot is used to the films advantage and in order to create tension. He avoids flashiness and instead brings in extreme maturity and patience to the film. Some stand out directing can be seen in the scenes in the asylum, when the swat team enters the room in the building (if youve seen it youll know what I mean. Hint: crucifixion) and the final showdown in the basement.
The film looks great on DVD with the picture being perfect. The sound had a couple of bad spots but for the most part it was great. The extras are great too with the deleted scenes being very interesting. Check it out.
This movie raised the bar for unrelenting suspense and tension and unfortunately its sequel failed to reach that bar. It lacked all of the elements that made this film great. But we will always have this film to re-visit and re-visit again. If you have not seen it I suggest you do.
Thanxs...",999302400,,2794,4.523715415019763
154914,5,0792842111,"This is a PERFECT example of an excellent DVD.  It has incredible picture and sound quality, awesome extras, and [best of all] it's an unbelievely GREAT movie.
First of all, the picture quality is great.  I have a regular 36"" TV and watching this movie on VHS blurrs some details.  For instance the ending scene with Lector walking away free in some forgein country, unlike on the VHS, on the DVD version, everyone of the dozens of people Lector passes by is explicitly clear and is clearly defined.
Next, the bonus stuff is super.  It has lots of deleted scenes, including a few which introduce the character of Paul Krendler [who plays a major role in ""Hannibal""].  Then the Outtake reel was nice, after being so tense watching the movie, it was nice to see outtakes of the characters acting naturally.  The featurette was also nice [for a featurette], but what really blew my socks off was the documentary.  The documentary, entitled ""Inside the Labyrinth"" was about 1 hr 10 min long, and was incredibly interesting and well put together.  It was surprizing to find all the incredible behind the scenes talent who worked on this movie; like Coleen Atwood, Howard Shore, Kristi Zea.  Also, after freaking me out in the movie, it was neat seeing Ted Levine (Buffalo Bill) out of character.  Exceptional documentary on an exceptional movie.

154915,5,0792842111,"""Silence of the Lambs,"" the first 'horror' film to win a Best Picture Oscar, is a number of things all at once: a suspense thriller, a look into the world of FBI profiling and procedure, and a story of a strong, intelligent woman trying to establish herself in a career dominated by men.
Director Jonathan Demme (""Something Wild,"" ""Married to the Mob""), working with a witty, intelligent screenplay by Ted Tally (based on the novel by Thomas Harris), crafts a film that is beautifully acted and produced.
Jodie Foster's self effacing performance as Clarice Starling is simply stunning, filled with strength, intelligence and pathos; Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter has been widely praised, and as good as he is, you're always aware that it's Hopkins ""pretending"" to be a psychotic killer; just as effective,if not more so, is Ted Levine's truly frightening potrayal of Jamie Gumm/""Buffalo Bill.""
Howard Shore's stunning score avoids all the usual horror film cliches.
After watching ""Lambs,"" the truly lame ""Hannibal"" seems to be even more of a dumb joke.
The DVD package is excellent, including a new documentary that features interviews with Hopkins, Demme, Ted Levine, Howard Shore and Ted Tally revealing the film was originally going to be made with Gene Hackman and Michelle Pfeiffer in the leads; the original 1991 ""making of"" documentary, and series of scenes deleted from the original cut.
""Silence"" is a great film, and the DVD package does it some nice justice.",999302400,2,1473,5.090909090909091
154916,5,0792842111,"The new anamorphic transfer on the new MGM/UA Silence of the Lambs DVD is much improved from the Criterion DVD edition, and also noticeable better than the Image DVD version. The picture looks sharp and clean; colors achieve a right balance between being bright in some scenes and subdued in others; black levels are accurately reproduced, a crucial aspect since many scenes take place in the dark. The new Dolby Digital 5.1 track is not state of the art, but definitely a great improvement from the 2.0 mix on earlier DVDs. The much sought-after Criterion DVD edition is, in my opinion, terribly overrated. Its pinkish picture quality is poor, its Dolby Surround sound is [bad], its text material about serial killers can be easily looked up on the Internet, its collection of deleted scenes have unwatchable video quality. Its only worthwhile material is the outstanding audio commentary, but that is not something you want to pay through your nose for now that the DVD is out of print.
The Criterion DVD has seven deleted scenes in poor video quality. The MGM disc has 22, including all from the Criterion disc, albeit some are in truncated form. And they all look and sound much better. Some of the deleted scenes that are not on the Criterion disc are quite startling. One of them is a dramatic shot of Lector, close to tears, speaking to the camera about Buffalo Bill's sickness and, via special effects, the prison wall MOVING towards him. Another deleted scene is Lector's offscreen murder of the ambulance driver -- we see a long shot of the ambulance swerving off the road, ending with a closeup of Lector in the driver seat wiping blood from his face, laughing. The MGM disc also has 2 documentaries not on the Criterion disc -- a superficial 10-minute featurette made in '91, and an engaging 1-hour retrospective made for this DVD. Hopkins is the only one interviewed in both. The 1-hour feature has a well-rounded coverage about the making of the film, including production design, costuming, special effects (those moths were ""dressed up"" since real ones couldn't be obtained), sound design, and of course the various themes of the story. It's too bad Howard Shore's superlative, Oscar-deprived music score is barely mentioned in either documentary. The 1-hour feature also does not overlook the fact that the film was once accused of being gay-bashing. And actor Ted Levine gives a thoughtfully-put analysis of his character, concluding that Jame Gumb is not really gay, but only has fantasies about being that. There are also a theatrical trailer and ten TV spots, one of them reveals something I hadn't noticed before -- the skull figure on the moth is actually made up of figures of naked women. Look closely on the skull figure on the cover of the DVD case.",998956800,22,2776,4.858649789029536
154917,4,0792842111,"Over the last couple of years, it seems the major studios have taken the hint from Criterion and decided to release the kind of ""special edition"" discs they made famous. As a proud owner of the Criterion release of Silence of the Lambs, I almost passed on this one. But I had a feeling about it, since it sports a new Hi-Definition, anamorphic transfer and Dolby 5.1 sound, as well as a new documentary and its own collection of deleted scenes. I was not disappointed by the purchase. While it is missing the wonderful Criterion commentary track, the documentary is surprisingly good; the deleted scenes - one in particular with Hopkins doing a surreal monologue about what makes a serial-killer tick - are quite illuminating. The picture looks great. The sound has greater definition, too - I can actually hear nuances in the orchestration of Howard Shore's moody background score that are simply lost in the Criterion release. As for the film itself - by now, everyone knows that it's a Campbell-esque ""hero's journey"" dressed up as a gothic horror/suspense yarn. Unusually, the hero is a woman - FBI agent trainee Clarice Starling (played by the deservedly Oscar-winning Jodie Foster). Her humanity is played against the rather baroque extremes of self-loathing serial killer Jame Gumb (Ted Levine), who kills women and skins them to make himself a ""girl suit"" and escape his identity. It is a meditation on institutional sexism as much as anything else, as Clarice must fight the continued ""little woman"" stereotyping and perverted leering of her almost exclusively male coworkers. The subtext rather uncomfortably reminds us that the serial killer's behavior is really just an extreme version of what often passes as normal ""boys will be boys"" behavior in the ""real"" world. In this respect, Silence of the Lambs is, paradoxically, a very feminist film about men who destroy women because they - again, paradoxically - hate their own male-ness and see it as a fraud. Except for Dr. Hannibal Lecter (the brilliant, also Oscar-winning Anthony Hopkins). He does not hate women any more or less than men. He hates rudeness, and is an equal-opportunity killer. The grim joke is that he is the most civilized and humane male character in the film: he treats Clarice with courtesy and respect. Hannibal is like the Shadow Self inside all of us - that vampiric character who stands at the end of the long, dark hallway of our nightmares, the one with the quiet, insinuating, evil voice. In Thomas Harris' novel of Hannibal, he becomes Clarice's shadow in an almost literal sense, and she learns to embrace him. But we can't have that in the movies, so Silence of the Lambs restricts its focus to the mythic/heroic aspect of the story, which ends up working very well, if it also ends up lacking a certain edginess or depth present in the novels. I would recommend buying this disc along with Hannibal, then watching the two films one right after the other, to get the full effect. Thomas Harris, in his novels, did not want us to get so hung up on Clarice as a hero that we missed the bigger picture about the seduction, corruption, and eventual purification of the human soul. Both films of his Clarice Starling books aim a lot lower, but they do manage to hit their somewhat reduced targets.",998697600,4,3289,4.833333333333333

Hopkins makes us believe he is a deranged killer, even when he is acting somewhat civilized... the first shot of Lector, the way the camera moves in to his cell, it's so errie... there he is, standing perfectly still, calm and collected in his glass cell which is a total contradiction from the other cells... however, the most exciting part of the movie is when Clarice goes to the house where Buffalo Bill lives... I thought the direction was superb... you have both Clarice and the FBI outside two different houses, and it's done in such a way that you believe the FBI are outside Buffalo Bills house, when really it's Clarice all by herself... then when you finally realize this, well it's pretty cool... and the scenes actually in the house are pretty intense as well...

I am no sociologist (coz I'm a 17-year-old for crying out loud!:), nevertheless, this symbolic indication is still quite perceptible through my observation.  Last week I attended a lecture (one which I paid a commensurate amount of $9 US) and the lecturing scholar pointed out two fascinating (or not) consistencies of all the renowned serial killers the world has endured over the past several centuries.  One being that their motives usually pertain to the acqusition of recognition/fame in his/her (those of the latter gender is extremely rare; makes me wonder why...) society, which is immersed with white-collar workers.  The while-collar worker detail signifies the fact that these ""anomalies"" only dig for middle~upper class citizens (e.g. Christian Bale in American Psycho).  How come?  According to this professor, third world countries do not appeal to these ""special people"". What I mean is simply that death is commonplace in these regions (therefore their desire for fame via murder is precluded); hence, they find it difficult, if not impossible, to create a ""market"" (of notroious homocides) in death-plagued sectors.

154950,5,0792842111,"The Movie: As a movie that launched imitators from the sublime (""The X-Files,"" ""Se7en"") to the schlocky (""Copycat,"" ""The Bone Collector""), ""The Silence of the Lambs"" could have become overdone and familiar through no fault of its own. Watching it again, however, you see what made it a hit. Far from a routine cat-and-mouse thriller, it is a heroine's journey cloaked in nightmarish imagery. (It's not for the squeamish. If horrific and disturbing movie violence -- particularly against women -- turns you off, I highly recommend AGAINST it.)
More horrifying than Jonathan Demme's imagery is the character interplay, and not always from the expected sources. Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter IS demonically attractive -- like Dracula or the Joker -- and Buffalo Bill IS depraved. But the film's underlying assertion is that a bit of Buffalo Bill's evil exists in MOST men. Witness the exchanges between Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling and Anthony Heald as Dr. Chilton. Even Scott Glenn as Jack Crawford displays some in the funeral home scene. Only Hannibal Lecter, for all his insanity, fully accepts Clarice on her own terms. No imitator has ever captured the perverse mentor-prodigy relationship between the two.
What's most amazing about the film, however, isn't the imagery or the performances or the attention to detail and accuracy. Most amazing is how, after ten years, an ill-advised sequel and countless imitators, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" still has the power, both on cerebral and visceral levels, to shock, disturb and terrify.
The DVD: Others have remarked upon the sub-par transfer, although the final chapter is color bars, which does little good for those using a DVD-ROM drive on a Macintosh or laptop monitor. And the disc could use a trailer and subtitle track.
Having said that, this DVD is not designed as much for film buffs as for scholars of criminology and behavioral science. Film buffs will find fodder here -- the storyboard sequences, the deleted scenes (the best of which is Jim Roche's televangelist rant against child abuse) and Jonathan Demme's commentary. However, the remaining extras focus more on the factual reality of serial killers and the FBI behavioral sciences division.
The commentary track is one of the best ever. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are highly intelligent actors who do far more than just relate anecdotes -- they relate their characters to deeper themes. Demme and screenwriter Ted Tally provide the ""making-of"" stories, and Douglas is fascinating.
The quality of this DVD depends on what you want. If you just want the movie as clear as possible with no frills, this probably isn't the best choice. If you're a student of criminology and the nature of evil, then yes, definitely. And if you're a die-hard fan of the movie, you'll probably want this AND another version -- perhaps the special edition slated for release this year.",993513600,22,2896,5.086134453781512

The scene where Clarice descends down into the dark pit of the hospital for the criminally insane, while rules such as,""DO NOT APPROACH THE GLASS!"" and, ""DO NOT TOUCH THE GLASS!"" are being barked out, is the best set up I've seen as an introduction to the ""villian.""  I had no idea what to expect next.
What I received was the coolest, smartest, most interesting psycho that Jonathan Demme and Anthony Hopkins created for film.  You couldn't help but like Lector and his ability as a psychiatrist to help Agent Starling confront her limitations and failures so as to live up to her expectations.  Yet, the look of calm on his face while he's bludgeoning the face of the guard with the nightstick is so frightening.
The film always had me on the edge of my seat trying to solve the case along with Starling.  The story never dawdled.  I wish this was true with ""Hannibal"", which took too long to reintroduce the characters with each other.  But, that is a seperate review.
A brilliant film, capturing the five major Academy Awards for it's year(1991).  This film is a modern classic.
The Criterion Collection Edition of this film is a must have.  It is well worth the... that it is currently valued.  Special Features include:  Commentary by Demme, Foster and Hopkins, screenwriter Ted Tally and FBI agent John Douglas; Seven deleted scenes(with commentary); Storyboards and a comparison to actual scenes in the film; FBI crime classification manual; Voices of Death:  word-for-word statements of convicted serial killers.  I'm a huge fan of Special Features.  Widescreen and the ability to watch a movie in French don't cut it.  My thinking is:  If you have the room, slap something on there.  Otherwise, what a waste.
The DVD comes with different cover art on its jewel box case than what is shown on this site.  The front is mostly Jodie Foster's face on the left with two small boxes on the right that show Lector's eyes(in red light) and Buffalo Bill's hand touching Agent Starling's hair(in green light).

154979,5,0792842111,"Horror films, if you can call this one, have always be neglected by the Academy (as have Westerns and Sci-Fi films) simply because of what they were or represented. Films like THE SIXTH SENSE proved that the horror genre still had some life left in it. But before SENSE, they was SILENCE!
Based on the 1988 novel by Thomas Harris, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is a film that deals with a murder investigation, and a rookie FBI agent looking for clues. Helping her is a man of great evil, though he doesn't show it for the first half of the film, his name is Dr. Hannibal Lecter -- also known as Hannibal the Cannibal! Yes, a cannibal -- someone who eats other human beings.
It stars Sir Anthony Hopkins as Lecter; Jodie Foster as Baltimore FBI rookie Clarice Starling; Scott Glenn as her boss Jack Crawford; director Kasi Lemmons (EVE'S BAYOU, THE CAVEMAN'S VALENTINE) as her roommate Ardelia Mapp; and Ted Levine as the killer Buffalo Bill.
When a prominent senator's daughter is kidnapped by Buffalo Bill, Clarice is assigned to find out from Dr. Lecter the clues as to where they can find Bill and save the girl. This takes Clarice, and us, into the psychotic world of a serial killer. Eventually, they round up the clues and locate Bill's house, thereby saving the portly Katherine Martin, senator Ruth Martin's daughter, from death.
The sick part of this film, other than the grotesque ways that Lecter uses to escape, and the head of Bill's gay lover in a jar, is the fact that Bill's motive is to: kidnap fat women, dump them in a well, starve them to thinness, and then shooting and dumping their bodies in lakes. Afterwards, he crams a cocoon into his victims' mouths. The cocoon belongs to the rare Death's-head moth. The reason? Because he wants to be a woman, a transexual! (I don't understand it, either!) But in the end, it is a woman who saves the day, while Hannibal Lecter escapes into the proverbial sunset. (See the excellent sequel HANNIBAL to find out the outcome.)
The cast is fabulous: Hopkins has created a new villain for our pop culture, someone that we can be genuinely afraid of just by his raspy-toned voice and that evil glare in his eyes. Hopkins, however, wasn't the first Lecter. In 1986, director Michael Mann (THE INSIDER) directed British actor Brian Cox in MANHUNTER, based on Thomas Harris's first Lecter adventure, ""Red Dragon."" Foster has given us a heroine who doesn't need a man, besides Lecter of course, to help her solve this case, or the typical damsel-in-distress routine where the knight comes in and saves the day. And an able supporting cast from Glenn, Levine, and others who helped make SILENCE the creepy film it is. (NOTE: Most of the characters in this film appear in Demme's 1993 film PHILADELPHIA, including his legendary mentor/director Roger Corman.)
Winner of 5 Academy Awards in 1991 include: Best Picture - Edward Saxon, Ron Bozman & Kenneth Utt, producers; Best Director - Jonathan Demme; Best Actor - Anthony Hopkins; Best Actress - Jodie Foster; Best Adapted Screenplay - Ted Tally.

Score: 96/100
When it won the 5 most important Oscar's (Picture, Actor, Actress, Director, Screenplay) in 1991, The Silence of the Lambs proved not only is it tear-jerking drama's that get so much attention, but the full-of-plot, intriguing thriller's are also an important part of film history.
Young FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is assigned to help find a missing woman to save her from a psychopathic serial killer who skins his victims. Clarice attempts to gain a better insight into the twisted mind of the killer by talking to another psychopath Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), who used to be a respected psychiatrist. FBI agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) believes that Lecter who is also a very powerful and clever mind manipulator have the answers to their questions to help locate the killer. Clarice must first try and gain Lecter's confidence before he is to give away any information.
The Silence of the Lambs is a clever, chilling and brain-numbing movie which just keeps getting better and better. The performances are quite simply superb, the two leads, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins both pull off uniquely amazing performances, and they have a great screen chemistry, while Scott Glenn and Ted Levine back them up nicely. Director Jonathan Demme pieces everything together awesomely with Ted Tally's extraordinary script, adapted from Thomas Harris' novel. On the subject of books and novels, this is one of the few films that has surpassed the high standards of its book, and The Silence of the Lambs deserved to be praised for that alone!

154997,5,0792842111,"The film starts off with a jog through the woods with about to be made Special Agent for the FBI, Clarice Starling, played by Jodie Foster in what is undeniably her best performance ever. Then we go into the office of her superior and we see newspaper clippings about a serial killer named Buffalo Bill, a man who not only kills his victims, but picks them big, starves them, and skins specific parts of their bodies for reasons that still make me squirm in my seat. Clarice stands before her boss as he gives her her first real assignment: To obtain the help of a psychological genius (who happens to be a federal criminal) who would be able understand the case for the FBI - Doctor Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lector. Then the movie really begins...
It all starts with a descent down into what looks like a dark cellar. There are security doors and guards and cameras everywhere, watching every move of anyone who goes in or out. Nothing happens without the say-so of the gatekeepers in this place. Then Clarice is instructed that Dr. Lector's cell is the last one down and to ""keep to the right."" She follows instructions, and we see things from her point of view as this man comes into view, standing perfectly still, not really at attention, not really waiting, but more like... resting... resting like a lion after a hard-earned kill, recharging so he can kill again. Clarice begins her conversation with Dr. Lector, who is so obviously the smartest person not just in the prison but possibly the smartest person she's ever met, and we see it sometimes from a distance and sometimes through her eyes, which is the mastery of the cinematography by Tak Fujimoto (who photographed ""The Sixth Sense""). Hannibal Lector's eyes are so dead and yet so piercing, full of calculating energy, that he immediately lends tension to a film that mostly doesn't even involve him. Anthony Hopkins' performance is so precisely delivered (modeled after Hal 9000, the computer in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"") during his mere fifteen minutes of screen time that no matter what happens during the rest of this film, which would've been a great movie all by itself in the hands of Jonathan Demme, we will remember Hannibal Lector and that great Anthony Hopkins performance forever. This is why ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is one of the greatest thrillers ever made, because it not only works on the levels of its main plot, which is the capturing of Buffalo Bill, but it works on a completely different level which involves the riveting relationship between Clarice and Hannibal. When they are together, it's like watching two genius chess players squaring off, but we as the audience know that Hannibal could checkmate Clarice at any time if he wanted to, but that's not his game. His game is getting inside her head. After all, he was a psychologist before he was a cannibal: It's what he does. The dialogue between Lector and Clarice could've been a movie all on its own, kind of a sadistic ""My Dinner with Andre."" Their conversations, especially when the tension builds and Clarice finally spills about her past, are the true heart of the movie, and for a movie that contains not one but two psychopaths like Buffalo Bill and Hannibal Lector, to find a heart amongst it all is an achievement all on its own.",984355200,,3285,4.714782608695653
154998,5,0792842111,"Psychological crime drama about FBI trainee Clarice Starling, played by Jodi Foster, pulled from training to help investigators apprehend a serial killer nicknamed ""Buffalo Bill"" who skins his victims. The movie is dominated by Clarice's special task in obtaining a psychological profile from another notorious serial killer confined in a maximum-security asylum, Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lector, portrayed by Anthony Hopkins. Clarice's visits with Dr. Lector are dicey, as the doctor can't resist exercising his mental skills on Clarice by probing her own painful past. Dr. Lector takes a liking to Clarice and offers to profile Buffalo Bill if she opens her thoughts to him. Clarice cooperates with the doctor, but soon finds this a frightening experience. In the meantime, the investigation heats up when investigators believe that Buffalo Bill, played by Ted Levine, has kidnapped the daughter of a state senator, and Clarice's work with Dr. Lector is in danger of compromise by the asylum's ambitious and jealous psychiatrist.
Overall this is a riveting feature, mostly by Hopkins's portrayal of Dr. Lector as an insane and dangerous serial killer with a chilling talent for penetrating people's guarded thoughts. Jodie Foster is convincing as the FBI trainee who is out to prove herself. The close-ups of Hopkins and Foster during key scenes have the effect of placing viewers next to Agent Starling, giving them a taste of the cold atmosphere and hypnotic effect of Lector. The story keeps you glued to the screen as the investigation unfolds and provides startling developments. It's a very good movie that ranks with other features such as ""Seven,"" ""The Onion Field"" and ""In Cold Blood.""

155003,5,0792842111,"After recently seeing ""Hannibal"" in the movie theater I was drawn to the original movie and storyline staring Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling a rookie FBI agent, along with Anthony Hopkins as the master of etiquette and grace that we have come to know as ""Hannibal the Cannibal"". The movie opens with agent Starling running alone through the woods, the music is suspenseful and she keeps looking off through the trees and over her shoulder. This sets the precedent for a movie that is more of a psychological roller coaster ride than a gore flick.
Starling is assigned to meet with the serial killer Hannibal Lector who has a tendency to eat his victims. Our first shot of him is another masterful stroke of cinematography. He stands demurely in the center of his cell, his arms by his sides, a small figure of a man, not quite the animal he has been built up to be. What follows is an intricate dance of verbiage between Clarice and Lector that lasts till the surprise ending. At one point Clarice tells a co-worker that she has no fear of Lector killing her that she is confident that he would find that unacceptable and rude. The relationship is certainly an interesting one as he helps Starling capture a serial murderer that has plagued the area. Of course it is all a word game and she has to figure out his clues.

Few movies have the power to chill me that deeply, but something about that quiet voice, civilly intoning knowedge of the deepest selves of anyone who crosses his path, wouldn't get out of my head.  I have always imagined the Devil to be something like that, weirdly fascinating and eminently civilised.  He could not otherwise beguile our souls.  Anthony Hopkins is so dead-on in his portrayal of mannerly evil that it is difficult to imagine him as anthing else - and impossible to get his insidious wispers out of your head.
Jodie Foster is brittle but tough as nails, exposing her own fragility as she plays a high-stakes headgame few could endure.  You can't help thinking this poor little screwed-up girl will never recover from the trauma of her experiences.

His performance chills you to the bone yet you can't help but laugh at some of the things he says. The movie is also fantastic. Instead of just being a straight forward serial killer thriller the movie became a classic with it's intense psychological aspect between the detectice Clarice Starling, played by Jodie Foster, and Dr. Lecter. The directing is very straight forward, sometimes almost documentary style and never gets in the way of the movie. With a story this strong flashy camera effects would've only distracted. With solid directing, great acting, and a good story this film is worthy of being called a modern classic.
As for the DVD it contains some great extra features. The Commentary is great although the person who introduces the actors everytime they speak is a bit annoying.

That scene outgrosses any scene in any given modern day horror movie. In fact I can't really watch the moment Hannibal escapes without covering my eyes. Jodie Foster is awesome in her portray of Clarice Sterling. I like how her character handles herself while amidst a group of male cops at a funeral. You rarely see a female role in movies where she doesn't take any kind of (nonsense)from male authority. Clarice Sterling is one of those rare characters.

When they were together in the movie, they suck you right out of your seat and your witnessing their conversation.

This film has the infamous Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lector, the serial killer who eats his victims. With outstanding performances by Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins, ""Silence"" is a must see horror film if you really want to tremble.
  FBI rookie Clarice Starling (Foster) is sent to a serial killer imprisonment jail to interview Hannibal Lector (Hopkins). The FBI is hoping to get information on a serial killer nemed Buffalo Bob, who collects women, starves his victims to kill them, skins them, and makes himself a women skin suit. With Lectors help, Starling gets closer to cathing Bob. Lector also gets deep in Starling's psyche, seeing that her father died when she was a child. We also learn that Starling ran away because the lambs wouldn't stop screaming. Hannibal eventually escapes from prison, and people are worried that he will come after Starling. Clarice knows he won't come after her because he would consider that ""rude"".
  Featuring some of the best lines ever used in a movie including ""I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti. Pppphhhhfffttttttttt!"", ""Good morning Clarice,"" ""Have the lambs stopped screaming?"" and ""By the way, love your suit.""

155028,5,0792842111,"The same declaration I made in my review of David Fincher's ""Seven"" applies here: I am a sucker for serial killer movies.  And what we've got here is the alpha and omega of serial killer movies, for it features not one but two distinctly drawn killers.  Each is terrifying in his own way, and the film's fascinating narrative device calls for one to help the FBI track down the other.  Also, like ""Seven"", most of the violence occurs off camera, allowing the audience to conceive of a far greater image of terror than any camera can capture.
We all know Hannibal Lecter, don't we?  Anthony Hopkins does a masterful job of creating one of my all-time favourite movie characters.  He is a curious mixture of charisma, grace, style, fierce intelligence, and wickedness, brought together with a series of fascinating and terrifying mannerisms.  Given all the hoopla surrounding Hopkins' performance, you'd think Hannibal was in every scene.  He is actually in relatively few.  Still, he easily manages to dominate the film.
Jodie Foster, on the other hand, is in almost every scene.  At one time I thought her performance as FBI agent-in-training Clarice Starling was much less successful.  Sure, she managed to hold her own in the scenes with Hopkins, but I always thought her stilted and inconsistent.  With each viewing, though, I realize that that is precisely the point.  Throw yourself into a similar situation and see how controlled and composed you are.  Foster suggests the right amount of macho bravura and timidness (a tough chore for sure).  And her wandering accent, I now realize, subtly conveys much information about the character's personal history.
These two actors shine most in their scenes together.  Lecter, training his laser-like psychiatrist's eye on Starling's every weakness from behind the glass in his maximum-security prison cell.  She does her best to defend against his probing, while trying to extract some information for herself.  When one interview ended, I couldn't wait for the next one to begin.  The supporting actors, who would normally blend into the background when confronted by two titanic leads, all acquit themselves well.  The standouts are Scott Glenn as Clarice's FBI superior, and Ted Levine as the aforementioned ""other"" serial killer.
The rest of the movie has a lot to live up to in those Lecter-Starling scenes.  Thankfully, it does.  Thomas Harris' novel and Ted Tally's script deliver a story full of suspense and interest.  'Buffalo Bill' has kidnapped the Governor's daughter, and the authorities realize they only have a few days to rescue her.  What should amount to a cliched premise is heightened by Bill's unique obsessive fetish.  It is revealed slowly, and thus manages the rare feat of rewarding subsequent viewings.  Jonathan Demme's controlled and stylish directing never lets things get out of hand or too over the top, as is the danger in movies of this genre.  And he allows himself to set up several spectacular set pieces; visual delights that at once thrill and frighten you (I'm thinking specifically of one aftermath tableaux that utilizes melodramatic lighting, music, and Christ-like imagery to great effect).  All these elements combine to create a magnum opus that all the participants will be hard-pressed to equal.",980726400,15,3293,5.106542056074766
155029,5,0792842111,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is really a mesh of stories that all end up working together to achieve a goal of greatness. One is the story of a serial killer who is kidnapping women and eluding authorities. One is the story of an FBI trainee who only wants to make it to FBI status. One, and perhaps the most chilling and complex of the three, is the story of a highly intellectual man with a taste for human flesh, kept hidden from the world until it becomes evident that he may have a way of helping the trainee discover the whereabouts of the killer.
Adapted from the novel by Thomas Harris, the film is a cauldron of mixed emotions that the audience will feel in every chilling moment. Jonathan Demme has created a masterpiece of the mind as well as a chilling thriller to jangle the nerves until the final, climactic ending.
When FBI trainee Clarice Starling is called upon to question Hannibal Lector, she readily accepts the mission in hopes of impressing her superiors. When she arrives at the asylum where he is held, the head of the facility heavily warns her about Lector's crimes: killing people and eating the flesh of his victims. When she comes face-to-face with Hannibal, she learns that he is more than a monster: he is an intellectual machine with a flair for large words and turning colorful phrases. He ultimately lends clues to Clarice in exchange for information about the case, and soon for information about her personal life, hoping to dive into the depths of her mind. Clarice hesitates, but gives him what he wants in order to get closer to solving the crime before the next victim is killed.
This film is such a masterpiece in terms of horror and suspense. This is not one of the average run-of-the-mill scare machines that comes along almost every year. This movie is so much more complex, so complex that it can be frightening. Among some of the factors that will have you feeling chills are the way in Clarice regails the experiences of her childhood to Hannibal, which is so depressing and emotional that you feel for her. She appears so broken that it looks as if she is reliving the entire experience, while at the same time keeping the one goal in mind to find the serial killer at large.
The most frightening of all is the way in which Hannibal is portrayed. Perhaps one of the most unique villians in all of Hollywood, the best part of his character is that the movie and novel do not play him out as a lunatic, but instead as a highly intelligent psychologist whose only crime is that of cannibalism. In the end, it's not so much the actions of his past that are frightening as much as the ability he has to get into Clarice's mind and dredge up horrifying memories from her past, all the while focusing his eyes only on her eyes, seemingly peering inside her very soul.
The outside story is filled with mounting suspense as the FBI closes in on the killer named Buffalo Bill, who skins his victims of their flesh in order to achieve something more chilling. Hannibal is able to offer information to the authorities as to the background of the man who they suspect is the killer, and the way in which he offers his information is quite suspenseful. It becomes evident that Clarice is going to be the one who finds the killer because of her relationship and communication with Lector. We find that he has a deep emotional attachment to her because of what she tells him about her past, and you'll find that to be one of the most intense realizations of the movie.
The two leads both won Academy Awards for their performances in this picture, and it's quite easy to see why. Jodie Foster is remarkable and stunning as Clarice Starling, who is innocent in the beginning and becomes swept up in emotional trauma and stress as she allows Lector to question her about her past. Her performance here is intense and true. Anthony Hopkins is masterful as Hannibal Lector, and his performance here is the entire centerpiece for the suspense of the film. Hopkins plays every aspect of Lector's persona to perfection, a great achievement in his acting career.
Winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a complex and stunning tale that dives deep into the minds of its characters and goes straight to the mind of its audiences. Expectations are sure to be met, for the movie has everything you could want: intelligence, thrills, chills, scares, action, emotion, and complexity. You'll find yourself waking up in the middle of the night, seeing the eyes of Hannibal Lector looking straight at you.",980726400,7,4553,4.615289765721331

155054,5,0792842111,"When The Silence of the Lambs took the Academy Awards ceremony by storm in 1992, winning in five major categories (Best Picture, Best Director - Jonathan Demme, Best Actor - Anthony Hopkins, Best Actress - Jodie Foster,  and Best Adapted Screenplay - Ted Tally), it beat the odds in more ways  than one. Granted, 1991 was a slow year for movies, and many pundits have  remarked that the Oscar field was among the weakest ever (the other  contenders were Disney's Beauty and the Beast, Bugsy, JFK, and the  overrated The Prince of Tides), but the strong showing of The Silence of  the Lambs was a surprise to almost everyone. In the first place, it was  released in February 1991, a date thought to be beyond the short memories  of the Academy members. Secondly, it is a dark psychological thriller - the  kind of movie that occasionally receives a Best Picture nomination, but  almost never takes home the statuette.
Although The Silence of the Lambs  is brilliantly constructed and powerfully acted, and became one of the most  recognizable thrillers of the '90s, it was neither the best movie of the  year (a citation I would award to Beauty and the Beast) nor even the best  thriller (overall, Dead Again impressed me more). The Silence of the Lambs  contains a number of inarguably great scenes, but the screenplay, adapted  from Thomas Harris' novel, suffers from a split personality. The scenes  featuring Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) are the stuff of legends.  However, the rest of the movie, which concentrates on the pursuit of serial  killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), has a familiar, derivative feel. In  truth, the climax couldn't be more mundane.
The Silence of the Lambs  opens by introducing us to FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), a  brilliant student who has been selected by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), the  head of the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit, to help in the pursuit of a  serial killer called Buffalo Bill, who skins his victims after murdering  them. Crawford wants Clarice to approach the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lecter,  or ""Hannibal the Cannibal"" as he has become known, and encourage  Lecter to provide a profile of Buffalo Bill. Crawford claims that Lecter  might be willing to open up to a woman - and he's right. The good doctor  offers Clarice a quid pro quo deal. For every piece of information he  shares about Buffalo Bill, Clarice must reveal one detail about her past.  So, while Lecter is helping Clarice get closer to Buffalo Bill, he is also  worming his way into her psyche. Perhaps surprisingly, however, she is  doing the same to him. The Silence of the Lambs consistently looks good,  builds suspense, and does not outstay its welcome. Many two-hour thrillers  have dead patches, but that's one characteristic of the genre this movie  avoids. Instead of using the common tactic of priming an audience by  employing ""boo!"" moments (fake scares, such as when an animal  darts out from behind trash cans), Demme uses what he calls ""deceptive  cutting"" to enhance the tension. There are also little cues that hint  at bigger dangers, such as when Clarice receives a nail prick while sliding  under the partially-closed door to the garage where she finds Gumb's first  victim.
That scene, with Clarice moving slowly through a dark, uncertain  world populated by mannequins, is one of the movie's creepiest. The longer,  original cut (available on both the",965260800,,3412,4.92091388400703

The extras that are  included on this disc abound.  The running commentary with Foster, Hopkins,  & Director Demme are an excellent insight into making this movie.  In  addition, the FBI files and commentary by the FBI agent, that Scott Glenn's  character is based on, is great.

155087,5,0792842111,"Based on Thomas Harris's aclaimed novel by the same name, The Silence of the Lambs is a very involved tale of an FBI academy student, Clarice M. Starling(Jodie Foster), who is sent to the cell of the famed serial killer  Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter(Anthony Hopkins), to try to  convince him to fill out a questionaire. Little does Clarice realize, the  head of the Behavioral Science department, Jack Crawford(John Glen), who  has sent her on this errand, really  has alterior motives. He has actually  sent her to get help from Lecter on tracking down a mischevious serial  killer, Buffalo Bill(Ted Levine), who skins his victims. Clarice meets with  Lecter to find he is an evil raving genius who is always a step ahead of  the game and always prying into the mind of anyone he meets. Clarice is  given a lead about Buffalo Bill by Lecter and he offers more information if  he can be moved to a cell with a view. Throughout the film these  confrontations continue between Lecter and Starling as Starling and  Crawford try to find Buffalo Bill, which turns out to be the highlight of  the film. What John Demme has given us with The Silence of the Lambs is far  greater then another story of a serial killer on the prowl. He has instead  created a wonderfully black comic, satire of America's fascination with the  serial killer. This makes the film great, along with the top notch, Academy  Award winning performances by Foster and Hopkins. The artful cinematography  is a plus too. What Demme has produced is folk art cinema.
The Criterion  Collection DVD of The Silence of the Lambs is absolutely packed with extra  features. The first worth mentioning is the word for word quotes of real  serial killers. This is not for the squeamish. It is a large catalog of  quotes of serial killers on specific subjects like their childhood and sex.  Another extra feature is the deleted scenes. These are interesting, but  nothing extraordinary, for example one deleted scene is a longer version of  the Yourself Storage facility sequence. Yet another extra feature is the  scene-to-storyboard comparison. This feature compares the scene in which  Lecter escapes from his cell in Memphis and mutilates the guards to the  storyboard. This is one of the better scene-to-storyboard comparisons I  have seen. The next extra feature is the entire storyboard of the film.  This is a nice feature if you enjoy storyboards and have about an hour to  sit down and view the entire thing. The last feature worth mentioning is  the commentary with director Jonathan Demme, Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster,  screenwriter Ted Tally, and FBI agent John Douglas. Actually the commentary  consists of the five different commentaries of these people compiled into  one. It is very interesting, each person has something very interesting to  say, especially Anthony Hopkins and John Douglas. The sad thing is that  each commentary is so interesting, I found myself wishing that they had  separated the five commentaries. The only problem I found with this DVD is  that there are no captions availible. There are many times during Lecter's  monologues where I would  have liked to have captions. This is a must-have  for any fan of the film. Even though the price is a bit steep, it is worth  the money.",963187200,5,3278,4.881818181818182
155088,5,0792842111,"Looking back, the '90s were sort of a mixed bag when it came to horror films.  Everyone seems to think that Scream really reinvigorated the genre, but in reality most '90s horror had too much self-conscious camp.  Not so  The Silence of the Lambs.  Many would not categorize it as horror but I do  simply because although it's also sort ""police procedural,""  ""psychological,"" and ""thriller,"" the things that Lector  and Buffalo Bill did are at least as grisly as Leatherface, Jason, and  Michael Myers.
The haunting images and sounds are made clearer than ever  with this DVD.  I loved getting commentary by Hopkins, Foster, and Demme,  plus the extra scenes.  If there's a complaint, it's the quotes by the  serial killers.  I was hoping they'd be five minute taped vignettes which  would bring us face-to-face with insanity.  Instead, it's seemingly endless  text which as someone else pointed out, can easily be found from numerous  ""crime story"" web sites--or your library.

155092,5,0792842111,"I really think it would be a good idea to admit that one cannot judge director Jonathan Demme's THE SILENCE BY THE LAMBS by saying that it's a scary movie or not. This point of view is so personal and is so depending  on your peculiar history that it cannot be relevant here. I'm not able to  tell you that the movie will frighten you a little bit, a lot or not at  all. I really don't know, that's it. And after all, who cares ?
As  always, the quality of the movie depends on what the director or, less  often, the screenplay writer has hidden behind the images shown and the  words spoken. Of course, the effort required from you is easier if you are  watching a Woody Allen movie because the quality of the dialogs has  sharpened your mind and you're not distracted by multiple car crashes or  noisy explosions. In the case of an atmospheric thriller like THE SILENCE  OF THE LAMBS, the nervous tension of your body due to the suspense of the  movie is certainly going to prevent you to discover all the secrets of the  film.
OK ! I'm not your schoolteacher, so I'm only going to give you a  hint or a key which, at least I hope so, will arouse your envy to watch THE  SILENCE OF THE LAMBS a second time. In numerous works of writers or film  directors, the theme of - The House - is often treated as a metaphor for  the human mind so why not have the courage to visit once again the house of  the serial killer and especially its cellar with the enormous superficies  lying under the basement.

Check the  special features & see for yourself what a bargain the Critereion  Collection version is.  Buying a standard version of this disk would simply  be cheating yourself.

155154,5,0792842111,"I've always considered Anthony Hopkins to the best actor I have seen...until I saw how incredible Jodie Foster was in this film.  She was  always in close running with Hopkins, but I must say she has actually  surpassed him a bit, in my humble opinion.  The direction here is pitch  perfect, the script is exciting, clever and undeniably heart-breaking.  Hopkins and Ted Levine are chilling in very different and important ways.  Foster, however, makes this entire film MEAN something.  I can't imagine  anyone else doing this role.  I hope this movie is NEVER re-made.  What  could possibly be the point?  Everyone involved with this film should be  proud.  I LOVE the sounds and the sets/costumes of the film, too.  I know  it's quite obvious that after this film there were a lot of serial killer  themed films made, but check out how influential the look of this film has  been on female ""FBI Agent"" types in movies.

155177,5,0792842111,"The Silence of the Lambs is a movie that in a couple of decades from now will stand as the groundbreaker in the dark thriller genre. It's clear to see where Seven and The Usual Suspects got their inspiration from. Even  though the novell  gives a better insight into Lecter's character, I've  learned that it's better to judge a movie on the movie itself then to  compare it with the book. What I love about this DVD, is that after 8  years, you still learn something new about the movie. At the end of the  film, when Jamie Gumb points the gun at Clarice's back, Jodie Foster  explains in the commentory that you can see the shadow of the gun on het  back. I a completely dark basement it is impossible to see a shadow. Just  to that little fact makes it worth to buy this DVD.",930614400,,778,4.238095238095238

One of the things that has always bothered me, is a kind of  glamorizing of this cannibalistic  murderer.
I see where a sequal is  being made.  I suspect that Lechter will be in some way  rehabilitated.
Another thing is the picture of Jamie Gumm.  I thought he  looked kind of silly and not all that ominous

155200,2,0792842111,"Having been a longtime admirer of Thomas Harris' first psych-thriller ""Red Dragon"" and the story based movie ""Manhunter"", I have always been disappointed with ""Silence of the Lambs"" for a  few reasons.  The notion of a brand new FBI agent (while still undergoing  her initial academy training) conducting a complex homicide investigation  for the Behavioral Sciences Unit is just too far-fetched.  This would be  tantamount to a first year medical school student performing a  triple-bypass or brain surgery.  Yet, this is precisely what ""Silence  of the Lambs"" does with Foster's character, Clarice Starling.  Unfortunately, this story defect completely taints the whole movie for me.  I find equally dubious the rookie Straling performing an autopsy; she is  still an academy-probationary employee!  Starling was also unconvincing in  her interview techniques with Hannibal Lecter...she was ""rolled""  by Lecter as she lost control of the interview process and disclosed her  personal history to a known sociopath.  The writers and producers should  have better researched the material before putting it to novel and  screenplay.  The fact is, law enforcement officials (be they your local  police or the FBI) spend many years acquiring the experience it takes to  become competent homicide investigators, particularly for serial murder  cases.  This glaring inaccuracy throughout the movie leads me to conclude  that the Starling character is nothing but window dressing. Although  Hopkins and Foster do provide fine acting performances, the storyline  suffers greatly from its defects.  I was downright irritated when  ""Silence of the Lambs"" won the Best Picture Oscar, due to its  bogus storyline.  ""Silence of the Lambs"" will always be credited  with starting the all too numerous clone movies and shows dealing with  criminal profiling; i.e., X-Files, Profiler, Millenium, Copy Cat, etc.,  etc. I have seen this movie in the theater, as well as on laserdisc. Yet,  it has always left me wanting more.  Attention to details!!!  It's a shame  that we couldn't substitute the stronger storyline and details from  ""Manhunter"" into ""Lambs"".  Anyways, ""Silence of  the Lambs"" will always be an overrated film, and just  ""lambchops"" within this movie genre.",928022400,14,2256,5.457725947521866
155201,4,0792842111,"Honestly, watching Silence of the Lambs nowadays, it's just so freaking obvious how much the X-Files took from it.  Of course, much has been said about  Foster's Starling being the inspiration for the X-Files's Dana  Scully.  However, the influence of this movie -- the cinemtography, mood,  dialogue, pacing, costumes, and villians -- is just so clear on the  X-Files, especially its first season.
Unfortunatedly, having watched the  X-Files for years, it has dulled the impact of Silence of the Lambs.  Its  style has been so copied and done that Silence of the Lambs merely now  seems like among the best of its type, rather than a groundbreaking  thriller.
Still, I'd highly recommend its viewing, if nothing else but to  see where the X-Files took its basic skeleton from.",927072000,,777,4.984375
155202,3,0792842111,"While no one can fault THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS on many levels, one must wonder whether the movie's technical excellence is enough to support the heinous nature of the story and the ultimate exploitation in its telling.  The good points are, of course, the superb DVD transfer and the always  preferrable widescreen formatting; the landmark performances of Hopkins and  Foster (and a stunning debut from underappreciated New York actress Brooke  Smith as Catherine Martin); and the overall foreboding tone of the  film--all of which are hugely successful.  But in the end, the film often  just devolves into perverse, gory pulp--the same conduct we are presumed to  abhor from Buffalo Bill is suddenly palatable (or at least often amusing)  when its carried on by Hannibal Lecter.  You think not?  Take a survey of  your friends/peers and see how many people were NOT happy that Lecter  escapes at the film's end, with the implication that he will exact revenge  on one of his smarmy captors.  Why?  Because of the charm and intelligence  that Hopkins imbues the character with; Lecter is so much more INTERESTING  than any of the other characters.  On its own, this may not have been such  an egregious decision by the filmmakers.  The trouble is, as always, the  hordes of similarly gross imitations of this film that have arisen in just  a few short years.  Murders and executions become ever grislier; deviates  are less loathsome if they are handsome or charming; police and law  enforcement are suitable targets for hideous treatment (ala RESERVOIR DOGS;  etc.).  Is art responsible for society's actions?  I doubt we'll ever solve  that one, but it does increasingly taint my viewing of THE SILENCE OF THE  LAMBS as the years go on.",926553600,6,1739,4.934027777777778
