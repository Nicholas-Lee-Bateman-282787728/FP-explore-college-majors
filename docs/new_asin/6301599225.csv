337853,3,6301599225,"William Faulkner's Southern stories come to the screen in this film directed by Martin Ritt and starring Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward in their first film together as a married couple. Newman stars as Ben Quick, a  drifter who infiltrates the family of Mississippi patriarch Will Varner  (Orson Welles, quite corpulent, and looking similar to his character in  Touch of Evil), his son Jody and wife Eula (Anthony Franciosa and a  smoldering Lee Remick) and umarried daughter (Woodward). The story unfolds  well, and it is Newman gives a solid performance as a cocky young man who  wants to feel a part of society.",963964800,6,615,4.922330097087379
337894,2,6301599225,"RELEASED IN 1958 and directed by Martin Ritt, The Long, Hot Summer is a Southern Gothic drama about an accused arsonist and opportunist (Paul Newman) who drifts into a Mississippi town and ingratiates himself with the wealthiest family, the Varners. Orson Welles plays the widower Varner patriarch, whos disappointed in his weak son (Anthony Franciosa) and unmarried daughter (Joan Woodward). Thus he sets his sights on the ambitious newcomer to properly carry on the Varner legacy. Lee Remick plays the sons wife and Richard Anderson appears as the daughters seeming suitor, a Mamas boy. Angela Lansbury is also on hand as Varners mistress who longs for marriage.

The notable cast is great and the beautiful southern locations are magnificent. So I was expecting a quality drama, but the writing is weak. Examples: Would this new drifter really be able to switch from being a sharecropper to a horse seller to a store clerk so successfully in the matter of a few days? I could handle this, though, and the bulk of the movie is okay late 50s drama; nothing great, but okay.

The lousy writing in the last act, however, ruins everything: Would the townsfolk really rush to lynch someone who clearly was nowhere near the crime scene? Would one character so readily warm up to another who idiotically just tried to murder him and slay several innocent creatures? After two hours of tension and bickering, even murder plots, would everyone just smile & hug and thats the end? Then there's the contrived ""treasure in the front yard"" element. Why sure!

In other news: This was the film where Newman and Woodward met. They married the same year the film was released and stayed together until Pauls death in 2008 (50 years!).

THE MOVIE RUNS 115 minutes and was shot entirely in Louisiana. WRITER: Irving Ravetch & Harriet Frank Jr. wrote the script from William Faulkners novel.

Watch this if you want to see early Paul Newman becoming great.  His impossible good looks may have been his ticket in, but he earned the ride in its entirety.

337902,5,6301599225,"It is easy to stereotype these surface sleepy, erratic mannerisms of post war rednecks.  However, the underlying motivations of pride, disappointments, fear, restlessness, boredom, loneliness, and agonizing dissatisfaction could rear up in a comparable way decades earlier or later.  Orson Welles becomes boss hog on steroids until Newman enters any scene and shrinks him down to the fat toddler he really represents.  It's fascinating to watch the old pit bull become a golden retriever in almost imperceptible ways.  I admit I'm a sucker for family melodrama but this one really is far more bold, frank, wicked, and suggestive than the censors normally allowed in .",1501372800,,667,5.3238095238095235

337915,3,6301599225,"Review of The Long, Hot Summer
Hot Toasty Rag, July 10, 2017

For anyone who likes real-life Hollywood love stories, you won't want to miss this one! Tracy and Hepburn, Bogart and Bacall, Gable and Lombard, and thanks to The Long, Hot Summer, Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward join the list.

While it isn't the most romantic movie in the world, and in fact doesnt usually come to mind when you think about cinematic love stories, it brought the two together during the ridiculously hot film set in Louisiana. Anyone whos spent a summer in the South knows how sweltering it can be, and director Martin Ritt wanted the actors sweat to look authentic! The story is simple: an ambitious drifter sweet talks the bosss daughter in order to move up in the world. The legacy is enduring, as Ma and Pa Newman have made more than their marks in the world.

If you want to watch the movie that brought them together, this is the one. If you're looking for a good love story from the 1950s, this is not the one. Try Picnic or Cat on a Hot Tin Roof instead. The movie is a little slow at times, and a little wordy. And Joanne seriously needed to let her bangs grow!",1499644800,,1151,4.369158878504673

The Hamlet could be made into an exceptional movie and especially now with CGI that would be capable of capturing some of eh action in the novel such as the horse chase in the Spotted Horses section.

Soon after this movie begins we find out that Paul Newman's character is proud to tell people that if you get on his wrong side, he might set your barn or house on fire. I guess that makes his character an anti-hero. As the movie plays out we see that all the people living in the southern town that Paul Newman's character has moved to are sinful mean-spirited racists. They all seem to be trying to get into bed with other people's (their neighbor's and co-worker's) spouses. Such immorality hasn't been this rampant since Sodom and Gamorah!
There's a lot of action as the movie goes along and the acting is pretty good all around, but between  the characters who were just plain nasty and evil and the other characters who were shallow, self-centered, and stupid, I wound up feeling like there wasn't anyone to root for or feel good about.
This movie was said to be ""hot and steamy"", but it made me glad that I didn't grow up in a nightmarish time and place like that.
This movie left me feeling sad about the human race.",1433116800,,1148,4.492822966507177

338251,4,6301599225,"This movie made quite a splash in 1958, and apparently there were concerns that it would be too hot for the censors.  It could have been if Martin Ritt had risked some explicitness in the scenes to match the explicitness of the script, which is quite a vivid concoction by Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank, based on elements in some stories and a novel by Faulkner.  Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward are very appealing as Ben Quick and Clara Varner, in a she-hates-him-until-she-loves-him relationship that breaks class barriers and that has to overcome Clara's father, Will Varner's, attempts to arrange a marriage between them because he desperately wants grandchildren to carry on the family line.  Complicating matters is the fact that Ben is a kindred spirit to the old rascal Will (Orson Welles), and Clara doesn't like her father's manipulativeness any more than she likes Ben's sexual confidence.  Ben, in fact, becomes more of a son to Will than his biological son Jody (Anthony Franciosa), and that leads to a different set of problems -- potentially tragic ones, although the broadly comic tone of the film means that the potential tragedy is perhaps wrapped up in a manner too easy to be totally credible.

Two things about sex are central to the film, though -- one is its relation to dynastic perpetuation and the other is simply to individual desire.  Clara is a schoolteacher, not ashamed of admitting to sexual frustration but at the same time wanting more out of a marriage than just to ""wake up in the morning smiling,"" to quote one great line from the movie.  As she becomes drawn to Ben, she is looking for him to show that he can offer that ""more.""  And there is a scene near the end where Ben's ""sensitivity,"" as we might now call it, can be seen.  It's not a totally credible scene as written, but Newman carries it off pretty well, and it also clarifies some plot elements that hark back to the very opening of the movie, where we see a barn on fire.  Needless to say, neither Clara nor Eula (Lee Remick), Jody's husband, is worried about dynastic perpetuation, but one feels that nature will take care of that.  And old Will isn't a dry stick yet -- by the end, he seems to have agreed to marry a woman of dubious reputation, played with verve by Angela Lansbury, so one feels that all bases have been covered.  Left out in the cold is Clara's previous love-interest Alan Stewart (Richard Anderson), who is the very stereotype of a Southern mama's boy.

The fun of the movie for an audience today is watching the rapport develop between Newman and Woodward, at a time when their private lives were intermingling, and enjoying the sexual explicitness of the writing that's contained but not overwhelmed by the relatively chaste visual quality of the movie.  Interested viewers might be tempted by a slightly later Ritt-Newman collaboration, the western ""Hombre,"" an under-rated and more serious affair.",1431216000,,2926,4.779761904761905

338371,5,6301599225,"The sexually searing film The Long Hot Summer written by Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank Jr. goes to show that male/female writing teams just like James Camron and Gale Anne Herd who wrote The Terminator can wield a powerful pen indeed.

The script is based on a combination of different William Falkner short stories including Spotted Horses and Barn Burning and Faulkners novel The Hamlet.  Its set during one hot summer in the Louisiana in a town called Frenchmans Bend and designed to work like a Tennessee Williams play which it succeeds doing on many levels especially in its poetic dialogue, smoldering sexuality and rich characterizations.  It was directed by William Ritt who was an assistant teacher at the Actors Studio to Elia Kazan.  Kazan directed a couple of excellent film versions of Williams plays himself including A Streetcar named Desire and Baby Doll.  Ritt cast the film with many of the Actors Studio former students back when well-trained actors were actually in movies and people who could actually write wrote scripts.  A testament to how well written the script really is can be seen in watching not just the original film but also in viewing the 1985 remake of the same name which ran on NBC as a miniseries.  The remake is even sultrier than the original with its sexual tension and heat literally rising off the screen and I recommend it highlyif you can get your hands on a copy.  As far as I know it has never been released to DVD.

Paul Newman (who deservedly won the Cannes Best Actor award for his performance) plays a drifter named Ben Quick with a reputation for burning barns.  After being thrown out of one town when one of the inhabitants property goes up in smoke Ben takes a boat to Frenchmans Bend and hitches a ride from the Varner girls; Clara, (Joanne Woodward) the prim and proper schoolmistress daughter of the towns patriarch Will Varner and Eula (Lee Remick), Wills beautiful and sexually charged daughter in law who is married to his screw up son Jody.  Bens timing is perfect as he arrives in town while Will is in the hospital and Jody, who is more interested in banging Eula than keeping up on current events, is not aware of Bens reputation.  He gives Ben a job working one of the Varners farms until Will arrives home a day later.  Will, a big commanding Big Daddy kind of personality is aware of Bens reputation.  He comes down hard on Jody, lays down the law and goes off to have a conversation with Ben.

Ben, a savvy man who is always open to opportunities, sees his threatening reputation as a way to make a deal with Will and move up in the world.  He quickly works his way into Wills favor starting with selling a bunch of Wills wild untamable horses all the while trying to get the attention of Wills daughter Clara.  Wills Achilles heel is his need for posterity and he is desperate to marry Clara off in order to breed enough Varner children to cover the country side.  But Clara is fixated on a genteel man named Allen Stewart who, as Ben tells her (in one of the films best scenes) that shes putting her money in the wrong bankwhich she is indeed.  Will seeing the gumption in Ben and fed up with Alans half-assed stagnant five year courtship of Clara gives Ben a job in his general store to compete with his son Jody and strikes yet another deal with Ben to get him closer to the headstrong Clara.

The DVD has the original theatrical trailer and English subtitles which in my opinion should be standard on any release.  It also includes Backstory: The Long Hot Summer which though vapid in its presentation contains some interesting trivia about the film.  For instance Angela Lansbury talks about how she liked playing Minnie Littlejohn because she finally got to play a character that is completely based on sex.  Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward who married in Las Vegas shortly after the film rapped purchased a large brass bed to sleep on during the shooting that was originally made and used in a whore house and Anthony Franciosa who was married to Shelly Winters at the time was arrested not long before the filming for punching a photographer in the facebut then can you blame him.  But the most interesting information is probably about Orson Wells who was twenty years younger than the character he played and had developed a reputation for being hostile and difficult to work with.  Hed just had a series of films that had flopped and was basically reduced to a desperate actor.  Its a shame Wells gets thought of mostly for Citizen Kane because in reality he had a very impressive career including directing The Magnificent Ambersons which is a brilliant film and the twisted and intriguing Touch of Evil.  He also turned in terrific performances playing truly despicable characters in The Stranger and the classic masterpiece The Third Man.  And he is brilliant here chewing up the scenery as Will Varner.  I mean think about it, how many forty something film posersI mean actors could pull off playing a roll like this so well?  Maybe Phillip Seymour Hoffman but then of course hes dead.  Wells had difficulty on the set being surrounded by method actors (much like method actors today must have difficulty being surrounded by...whatever they are) and mumbled some of his lines beyond what could be deciphered but almost no one else could have played the part so convincingly and so well.",1413331200,,5374,4.679064824654623

Most of them a very young group who go on to great things. I am from this era so when i first saw it I didn't love it like I do now. I didn't even know who Angela Lansbury was then, but even her small part has more impact now that I am a great fan. But it's Paul Newman's boyish, devilish, sexy magnetism, yet with a touching vulnerability that mesmerizes, especially in scenes with Joanne Woodward, and especially now that we have the perspective of their lifetime love and marraige. The story is mosty based on Faulkner writings, but reminds me more of Tennessee Williams: story set in the south of the son of a ""barn burner"" running away from his past and with a his clever scams finds a place with Orson Wells' and his family. Orson Wells, expcept for the bad makeup, makes a great Southern family icon who blusters his way to power and dominates everyone in his path.  But for me it could have been any story as a setting for this group that includes a very poignant performance by Anthony Franciosa and the bright performance and innocence of a very young Lee Remick. I also want to note that those early days of ""technicolor"" were very primitive. I liked black and white better. We have come a long way with a natural color.",1395705600,,1361,4.358267716535433

At that time I did not have the knowledge of the back story of the  personal relationship of its stars Paul Newman and Joanne Woodard.  The acting was wonderful by all even though at times it was difficult to understand some of the dialog of Orson Wells.  As I review the movie now the best performance was that of Tony Franciosa, whose every  emotion was on full display .  At the time the movie was made in 1958 some of the subject matter could only be whispered about, which may have been the caused of the movie not being well received at the time of its release.

The quintessential bad boy, Paul Newman nails it - he can nail me anytime! If you don't cry when Joanne Woodward pours out her heart on the footbridge, then you are not human. My favorite part, however, is when Orson Welles pounds the glass table in anger, jump alert.

In short, the film is a beguiling portrayal of characters whose cultural and economic foundations were, in fact, crumbling.  Emblematic of the cynical and prophetic subtext of the film is that one of the dying patriarch's heirs is engaged in deluded and ultimately disillusioned pursuit of a buried treasure that does not exist, that never existed.  Best to see A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE in tandem with THE LONG HOT SUMMER to better understand how political and social power shifted in the civil-rights-era South from country to city, from segregation to integration, from family dining rooms to federal courts.",1383091200,7,844,5.145985401459854

When she passed, we got a lot of those tapes, and this is one of the ones my FIVE (!) daughters treasure, so I picked up a DVD copy. Quite risqu for 1958, what my girls (and I) loved was the smart dialogue, delivered by a great group of actors. Orson Welles is easily the best actor of the bunch (considering his range), but none of the others backed down to him an inch. Joanne Woodward, Paul Newman, and a delightful Angela Lansbury went toe-to-toe with him, and the result is just a scintillating motion picture.

A favorite scene of my family's is when Ben Quick (Newman) moves into the Varner household, and he has an exchange with Clara Varner (Woodward) with him on the veranda with his shirt off, and she's propped up in her bed. He throws a pillow over his shoulder, and one of my girls remarked with a big sigh, ""I wish I were that pillow!""",1379635200,,940,4.3107344632768365

I think since they made the movie ""The Brass Ring"" made in St. Louis and Kansas City that he was involved there with people from our school.  In ""The Long Hot Summer""  Orson Welles plays the part of a southern plantation owner in Mississippi by the name of Varner.  That name is on my Family Tree Maker by the husband of a daughter of one of my father's cousins from Arkansas, called ""a gentleman farmer"" is Varner.  His attitude toward having and wanting grandchildren in the part, reminded me of my father from the south as I was also a teacher as was Joanne Woodard in the movie.  They do love having grandchildren in the south. I loved the movie.  I didn't like his attitude toward his son though and didn't know why he down-putted him so much.  The movie also showed the difference in the way of living in the south which I enjoyed.  Kay",1379116800,,996,4.306451612903226
338654,5,6301599225,"A few days ago when the temperature climbed to 100+ degrees, the Long Hot Summer came to mind. The VHS was gone, so I got on Amazon and in two days I had the ""hot"" little disc in the DVR. Paul Newman is such a great actor - can't think of any of his movies on my X list. Teaming up with Joanne Woodward guarantees a good movie. Set in the deep South, where 100+ degrees are normal, Newman's character - Ben Quick - has a reputation for burning barns, all of which relates back to his father, his childhood and poverty. Orson Wells is marvelous as a wealthy landowner (owns most of the town) who wants  his daughter (Clara(Woodward) to get married and bring forth children. James Franciosa is the son married to Lee Remic who enjoys a life of privilege. Daddy thinks Ben Quick is a lot like him and would make Clara very happy, but Clara doesn't see it that way, so the pursuit begins. How Clara could resist him next to the namby-pamby boyfriend makes the chase even better. A favorite line from Lee Remic to Franciosa, because he's always chasing her to the bedroom, ""I sure do wish you would find yourself some other form of recreation!"" Orson Wells does a good job in this lighter story vs the dark, serious movies he has made. Enjoy this film any time. AAAAA rating!!!",1378771200,,1272,4.367088607594937

The film doesn't have a cast of thousands, but what it does have is the raw,rough excitement of a time long past that reflects the mores and sensibilities of an age when straight talk and no nonsense actions were the order of the day.  The performances by Newman and Woodward are moving and thoughtful to the point of almost being uncomfortable listening to the dialogue, but it holds the premise of the story. Orson Wells could have done a more proficient job with his part, but his mumbling, stumbling and disjointed attempt as the ""big boss, father figure"" lessened the overall quality of the story.  Nonetheless, the casting was superb, the acting realistic and the conclusion heartfelt and warming to the once gentility that was a proud and dignified southern life.

338802,5,6301599225,"What a cast!  Orson Wells, Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward (whom Newman would marry after meeting her on the set of this film), Angela Lansbury, Lee Remick, and Anthony Franciosa.  The film, based on William Faulkner's work, is set in the deep south, during a, well, long hot summer.  Everyone is sweating in the film, giving it an air of authenticity.  (And this is before global warming!)

Newman plays Ben Quick, who arrives in town after being accused of a barn burning, supposedly in revenge, in another town.  He quickly latches on to the richest family in the colorfully named Mississippi town, Frenchman's Bend.  Quick is apparently the energetic and ambitious son that Will Varner always hoped for.  Varner's own son, Jody, is thought by the patrician of the family to lack ambition and drive.

Woodward plays Will's headstrong daughter Clara.  She gives an excellent performance, and once you watch the film, you'll understand what attracted Newman.  Lansbury also gives a great performance, shedding her English accent for a Southern Accent.  Remick has a lesser role, but looks stunning doing it.

338848,4,6301599225,"I haven't read the William Faulkner novel ""The Hamlet"", nor the other short stories from which this film was adapted, but I'd have to guess from what I know of the author's other works that it's a pretty loose rendition.  Oh, the basic, typical Faulkner elements are here: the once-proud but now decaying family, the patriarch concerned about propagating his heritage into the future, the suspicions of strangers that come into the settled town and change things, the carnality and sexuality of women, the repression of desires by both sexes.  But on the whole this is ""lighter"" and more optimistic-feeling than any work of the writer that I've read, and it certainly strikes me as unlikely that the novel - published in 1940 - is as full of humor, and short on gothic misery, as the film.  I guess I'll have to read it and find out...

All that's by way of saying that this ain't a film you need to go into worrying about Faulknerian heaviness.  Even the florid, over-the-top character of Will Varner (Orson Welles at his most charismatic and unstoppable), who dominates the small town of Frenchman's Bend through generosity and a gregarious nature as much as, or perhaps more than through the usual threats and intimidations - even he is as much a comic figure as anything.  And pairing the force of nature Welles with the young Paul Newman as Ben Quick, ne'er do-well drifter who's looking for a piece of the Varner financial pie - and the Varner daughter Clara (Joanne Woodward) results not in a clash of egos and styles (at least not onscreen) but rather a contest of similar florid, scenery-chewing actors who seem to be having a good ol' time.  And much of that, thankfully, translates into a good ol' time for us in the audience as well.

The basic storyline here is that Quick - run out of one town for supposed barn-burning - hitches a ride on a barge and ends up in this backwater Mississippi town, making the acquaintance of a couple of the town's young lovelies in the forms of Clara and her sister-in-law Eula (Lee Remick).  Eula is married to Jody (Anthony Franciosa), Clara's older brother, a weak-willed and possibly impotent (it's only hinted at here) young man who seems incapable of pleasing his blustery father Will.  Clara has been in a long-running semi-courtship with another weak man, Alan Stewart (Richard Anderson) who is sickly and under the thumb of a domineering mother - so the Alpha-male Quick is speedily sized up and found suitable as potential mating material for his spinster daughter by old Will, who throws himself around with even more weight than Welles was packing when the film was made (and that's saying something).

But as I said, it's not entirely Faulknerian Southern Gothic in style, perhaps closer to a mild Peyton Place atmosphere, maybe crossed with some ""Hud""-era Larry McMurtry.  And that's OK, because the actors all have fun with it, the location work is nice, and the whole thing does convey at least a little bit of the sense of the land and people and history that were the writer's life's work - even if only Woodward among the members of the principal cast was actually southern.  I think she fares the best overall, regardless of her more realistic accent, getting pretty well the mixture of feelings that this smart, educated young woman has about being potentially pushed into a life where her abilities and talents won't be appreciated.  Newman certainly has the charisma and charm for Ben Quick, but the darker and harder aspects of the character aren't opened up enough by screewriters Irving Ravitch and Harriet Frank for him to get as much juice out of it as he might.  Remick doesn't have much to do but look pretty - which she does spectacularly well; Franciosa is playing a fairly stereotypical pathetic-son-trying-to-please-daddy but he carries it off nicely, always believably insecure around Welles and belligerent around Newman.  Which leaves us with The Great Man, Orson the Magnificent who is...well, he's Orson.  Hammy and showing off and dominating, I have no idea if this is the way the character was written but he's larger than life and full of energy, raging and laughing, yelling and joking.  Half the time he's very hard to understand - and that's AFTER much of his part was post-dubbed (for that matter a large chunk of the film was looped, not just Welles' role).  Talking a mile a minute, slurring his voice, changing his pitch - supposedly tricks to infuriate director Ritt, according to some sources.  Well, maybe - but however much truth there is to that, he's magnetic and if he doesn't seem any more like he's from Mississippi than any of the rest of the cast, it does feel at times like he understands the Gothic, overdramatic nature of it all like no one else does.

In short, it's not quite Faulkner - not quite ""real"" - not quite a perfectly worked-out piece of narrative - but it's compulsively watchable thanks to the powerful cast, who may not have been making a masterpiece but who were clearly under a spell of some kind, and doing what Hollywood in those days did best - taking us out of our mundane world filled with mundane people, and bringing us to a land of larger-than-life characters, some of whom at least sure seem like they'd be fun to share a cold beer with, on a hot Mississippi summer afternoon.

The DVD looks fine, the colors bright and full of heat; the extras aren't substantial though there is a half-hour ""making"" of piece that was originally on TV and isn't terribly useful.",1284768000,2,5497,4.740041928721174

An amalgam comprised of a three short stories from Faulkner, this sizzling, enthralling drama couples difficult themes with lighthearted sometimes sharp banter.  Ben Quick is a misunderstood, stoic, and hot-headed young man with a reticent,determined nature who finds himself in a Missisippi sharecropping community dominated by a family known as ""Varner.""

As it turns out, Clara, the daughter of  Will Varner, offers Ben Quick a ride, although not a little begrudgingly.  Beautiful and creative, Clara is stifled by her father's outlandish expectations because he views marriage as a  merger rather than a matter of heart.

What happens when two strong-willed people find themselves connected by a father's mechanations and the draw of one long hot summer:  propelled by three different romances, a myriad of accusations, a slew of barn burnings, strained family relations, repressed desire, humorous, sharp-tongued Southern belles, a troubled brother who exercises his demons, and ultimately a community's efforts to ban together in the face of adversity?

The wonderful answer:  a film brimming with chemistry, heat, passion that boasts a intelligent interpretation, memorable dialogue, and that fully showcases the passion Newman and Woodward displayed on and offscreen as well as a pleasingly somewhat comical ending.

The lesson:  appearances can be deceiving; don't ever judge a book by its cover.

Director Martin Ritt, in his second effort after ""Edge of the City""(soon to released on DVD) shows the sure hand that he displayed in his other Southern-fried works.  The film is both sultry and ribald that it will leave you in stitches.  The dialogue is as cutting as anything this side of ""The Sweet Smell of Success"".  The casting here is impeccable.  Paul Newman is quite good here.  He demonstrates a little bit of the method that informs a lot of his early work but his work does suggest the assuredness that came later in ""The Hustler"" and ""Hud"".  Joanne Woodward, however, is masterful as the plain Jane daughter who Newman has designs on.  On paper you wouldn't think that Newman and Woodward would be a good coupling but they have kinetic chemistry onscreen that was also demonstrated in their successful offscreen marriage.  Many have compared Orson Welles' work as a Big Daddy knock-off but I found it to be a truly original rendering.  Welles walks the tightrope here between chewing the scenery and hamming it up but his daring portrayal of Will Varner is one for the ages.  Tony Franciosa gives a sympathetic turn as Varner's neglected son and Lee Remick exudes eroticism whether in a sundress or a slip.

The intermission consisted of an infomercial of the Schaeffer Brewing Company, extolling the highlights of its history.

A  N  Y  W  A  Y  .  .  .

Even as a kid (and not knowing they were married) I could see something was simmering between Newman and Woodward.  I was also certain that Orson Welles was an incarnation of self-made, without-any-smooth-edges Southern gentry in pursuit of a blousy Angela Lansbury(At the time the only other thing I had seen Welles in was Macbeth and I did not connect the bloody Scot with Will Varner).  Lee Remick glowed and Tony Franciosa was convincingly lost as everything he took for granted was his was deftly removed, like a razor taken from his hand mid-stroke during his morning shave.  The supporting cast only clunked once or twice, but for the most part fit in with the ""gestalt"" of the film.  I realize that Faulkner might have ended the story with Ben Quick vanishing as quickly as he had appeared and Daddy Varner would have bought the farm in flagrante delicto, but this is a piece of '50's Hollywood, when we still had stars, and actors who could act without having to rely on close-ups and electronic tweaking to give their voices range.  Watching this with an appropriate mind-set will add to its appeal.

The moment Paul Newman's Ben Quick, rebellious and irresistible drifter enters a rural Mississippi town of Frenchman's Bend to stir up its women, puzzle its men and to catch the interest of Big Daddy Varner (Orson Welles, the ferocious force of nature seemed to have fun playing Will Varner and experimenting with make-up) the town richest and most powerful redneck who perhaps sees in Ben a lot of himself, the screen legend was born.

""The Long, Hot Summer"" (1958) is based on five short stories and a novel by one of the America's greatest novelists and storytellers, the expert of Southern life, William  Faulkner, and the film is a steamy, moving, often funny (perhaps, unintentionally) tale of lust, greed, jealousy, and larger than life personalities and their clashes. I guess I need to read more Faulkner's stories because I was surprised to see the film that is based on the works of the writer known for his heavy use of such sophisticated literary techniques as symbolism, allegory, and especially stream of consciousness, the film which linear narrative is easy to follow from the third person point-of-view.

Besides Paul Newman who was as talented as he was hot, his off- screen wife-to-be Joanna Woodward shines as Clara  Varner, Will's intelligent, thinking daughter, the teacher in a local school whom her father wants to see married (and not just wants but takes certain steps that Clara does not like and feels offended by). The film was the first of many Newman's and Woodward's collaboration and it is not easy to recall the greater chemistry between two leads. Orson Welles dominates the screen in his every scene as expected. 21-years-old Lee Remick (Eula, Varner's daughter-in-law, sexy and innocent woman-child), Anthony Franciosa (Jody, Varner's overlooked and jealous son), and Angela Lansbury (Minnie, the woman who has her own plans about future that include a widower Varner in them) all add to the sizzling fun that ""The Long Hot Summer"" is.",1179964800,4,2086,4.985632183908046

338974,3,6301599225,"""The Long, Hot Summer,"" the first of six films he made for director Martin Ritt and the first of seven co-starring Joanne Woodward, is based on two short stories and part of a novel by Faulkner, provided him with his best role to that time...

Ben Quick (Newman), a foolhardy, opportunistic young wanderer, drifts into a Mississippi town owned and run by the huge, powerful Will Varner (Orson Welles), who also dominates his daughter Clara (Woodward), a 23-year-o1d unmarried schoolteacher... Despite Quick's reputation as a ""barnburner,"" he is hired by Varner, and rapid1y works his way up to a partnership in the general store and a room in the main house...

Varner, like Big Daddy in ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,"" wants strong descendants, and since his son is a weakling, he decides that Clara will marry Quick, whose aggressive masculinity he admires (he calls Quick a ""big stud horse""). Clara, offended by Quick's very self-satisfaction and vulgar manner, and by both men's treating her as property, resists...

Like Billy the Kid, Quick is an outcast, isolated from humanity because of his notorious reputation... But in temperament he's the opposite, an extreme extrovert... From the very beginning, Newman, hat down low over his forehead, eyes gleaming with ambition, projects an overwhelming confidence, self-satisfaction and, above all, electrifying virility... Cynical, arrogant, crude and unwilling to allow anything to interfere with his drive, he resembles Larry Maddux of ""The Helen Morgan Story."" But now the portrayal is more than one-dimensional: behind Quick's hard blue eyes, barely hidden sneer and devilish smile there's enough intelligence, humor, charm, and downright attractiveness to force our involvement in his quest for power...

This is due entirely to Newman's ingenious acting, because as written the character reveals no positive traits until near the end, when he breaks down and tells Clara the truth about himself... It's a powerful scene: his voice breaking, eyes filling slow1y with tears, Newman effectively depicts a man whose carefully formed cold shell is finally cracking to reveal the vulnerable soul within...

The confession gives him a bond of equality with Clara that enables him to stand up decisively to Varner... But even earlier, Quick was never completely dominated by the old man... Of all the father-figures in Newman's films, Varner seems the most imposing, but Quick, unlike the weakling sons in ""The Rack"" and ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,"" isn't passive enough to be stepped upon...

William Faulkner's characters are perfect foils: Newman is sexually sure, and seemingly devoid of vulnerability and humanity; Woodward is a virgin, extremely vulnerable, and longing to express her humanity... She teaches him humility and the value of an individual; he helps her discover her sexuality...

Two scenes are among the best in their careers, partly because of the sharp dialog by the screenwriters... In the first, Clara comes to see Ben in the store at night... After much childish verbal attacks and a few unperceptive truths, the two have pierced beneath the surface and have found the nerve endings of each other's weaknesses...

Later, in the film's finest scene, Clara expresses herself more maturely, asserting that he has the wrong idea about her: she is no ""trembling little rabbit, full of smoldering unsatisfied desires,"" but a full-grown, intelligent woman, who will not be bought and sold... She says he's too much like her father: ""I gave up on him when I was nine years old, and I gave up on you the first time I ever looked into those cold blue eyes.""

With his firm and fresh manner Quick sums up his honest, hard, purely sexual appraisal of life: ""Well, I can see you don't like me, but you're gonna have me. It's gonna be you and me... """,1168041600,6,3802,5.0704
338985,5,6301599225,"This is a very entertaining melodrama.  Paul Newman is incredibly handsome as a charismatic drifter and  Joanne Woodward is perfect as a repressed yet spunky schoolteacher.  Orson Welles plays Woodward's father in a manner that brings Boss Hogg to mind.  His fake Southern accent, though, is so tough to understand it is fortunate that this film is close captioned.  Lee Remick is lovely as a brainless Southern belle but Tony Francioso seems miscast as Welles's despised weakling son. Angela Lansbury is also at hand and does a passing Southern accent for a British gal.  The ending is not at all what I expected but I'm sure it pleased 1950's movie audiences.

sensual glow. Martin Ritt's powerful direction and the literate,

well-written Irving Ravetch-Harriet Frank Jr. script show how to film a book perfectly. But what really puts the movie over are the wonderful performances by its top-notch cast. Orson Welles,Anthony Franciosa,Lee Remick,and Angela Lansbury are

all outstanding. However,the movie belongs to its two stars.

338990,5,6301599225,"Well now, what do we have here? It is nothing less than one of the best and sexiest southern fried dramas from the 1950's. This adaptation of several works of William Faulkner is a tour de force for everyone involved. How lucky are we to have two great films on southern family life starring Paul Newman come out in 1958? This film is a fine companion piece to ""Cat On A Hot Tin Roof"", a bit more upbeat than ""Cat""  but still full of sound and fury.

  As Ben Quick, Paul Newman ignites the screen and fairly burns down half of Mississippi in the process with his incredible magnetism. He brings to Quick all he as to bear as an actor and creates one of his early memorable performances.  Just watch him as bare chested he hugs his pillow on the hot veranda while watching Joanne Woodward through a screen door sitting up in her bed trying to ignore him, or his walk across the Varner yard early on in the film, his interactions with Orson Wells or Tony Franciosa. He is every inch the ""mean and dirty"" barnburner everyone thinks he is. He is just what the Varner family and Clara Varner in particular need to feed their respective fever dreams brought on by the heat of this particular August in the south.

  Hitting her marks in a great performance is Joanne Woodward. She being a true daughter of the South comes to the table with and extra barrel loaded. As Clara Varner she is both needy and steely, a magnolia ready to be plucked but at that same time fearful that she will be passed over and left to wither on the vine. Her scene in the general store after closing time with Newman is just about one of the steamiest love scenes ever filmed this

side of ""Picnic"".  Miss Woodward here in this film is pure magic to watch and in combination with Paul Newman the pair become an alchemy of fireworks and lightning bugs on a summers night.

  Adding to the fine cast is Lee Remick, Tony Franciosa, the incredible Angela Lansbury and the equally and always impressive Orson Wells. I would go on about each of them but I think it best to let them surprise you. That's half the fun of the film.

  The score by Alex North is memorable and one of his best. The cinematography by Joseph LeShelle captures the hazy heat of Mississippi. And Martin Ritt's direction of all parties concerned is perfectly on target. Be sure to check some of his other collaborations with Newman, ""Paris Blues"", ""Hud"" to mention only two.

  Pour yourself a tall sweet tea, kick off your shoes and open the veranda doors and let the breeze of this long hot summer envelope you.",1121990400,96,2554,4.418803418803419
338991,3,6301599225,"Joanne Woodward plays the 22-year-old maid with a mama's boy beau and Paul Newman the menacing - well, roguishly and charmingly menacing, anyway - prince with eyes for her in Martin Ritt's THE LONG HOT SUMMER.

  As one of the dvd extras tells us, Woodward and Newman were hot in love during the filming of this movie, and their chemistry translates well onto the screen.  The story, a young girl coming of age and finding love, didn't do much for me.  Orson Welles, hidden behind a movable rubber nose and a thick layer of insta-tan, mumbles in an incomprehensible southern accent and chews the scenery in just about every scene he's in.

  This is purportedly based on a number of short stories by William Faulkner.  Save for some character names and the use of barn burning as a plot device the Faulkner link is pretty tenuous.

  If you enjoy romantic melodramas, or are a fan of the stars, it's likely you'll enjoy this one more than I did. I thought it was just okay.",1106956800,13,973,4.528735632183908
338992,4,6301599225,"I saw the LONG HOT SUMMER on the big screen back in 1958 when I was 16 and thought it was fabulous.  I'm older now, and although the film still has some appeal, mainly because of the two lead actors whom I admire very much, I didn't enjoy the film as much on the small screen today. For one thing, the detail in some shots is hard to see which might not be the case if you have a large viewing screen. For another thing, I don't think it is clear to me even yet why old man Will Varner (Orson Wells in a ""big Daddy"" type role) has it in for his son (Anthony Franciosa). Faulkner's tales, the basis of the screen play, may reveal the source of the animosity between the two men, but this film does not. The closest we come to understanding Will Varner's cruel behavior is to hear him call his son ""weak"" which does not seem to be the case for Miss Varner's equally effeminate beau who is obviously a mama's boy, and whom Will Varner would approve as the stud for his daughter if only he would ""pop"" the question. Both young men seem weak compared to the muscular, virile, tanned Newman (Ben Quick).  Furthermore, why is a beautiful girl like Joanne Woodward unmarried in the old South where couples ran off in their teens? And, what father would bribe a ""no account barn-buring drifter"" to wed his daughter? Again, the Faulkner tales probably reveal much the screen play misses.

The film has it's appeal -  the actors are beautiful (including Lee Remick who went on to play acclaimed roles as drunken and/or crazy wives), and Angela Landsbury (Jessica Fletcher) is wonderful as Minnie, the long suffering mistress of Will Varner. Based on it's price, this is a good buy for your ""oldies"" film library as the story is instructive for youngsters who wonder what fueled the youthful rebellion that later culminated in Women's Movement in the late 1950s.",1094428800,7,1850,4.497023809523809
338993,4,6301599225,"This movie, released in 1958, must have raised eyebrows in the declining Eisenhower years. Sometimes less is more. It is amazing how sexy and erotic a movie can be without the lead characters running around naked. You can feel the sizzling electricity between Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward; but then, they weren't acting since they married soon after finishing this film. Although the movie is billed as ""William Faulkner's The Long Hot Summer"" and is based on some of his stories, I kept seeing and hearing shades of ""Cat On A Hot Tin Roof,"" which came out in the same year so I don't know who influenced whom if at all.

Both Newman as the sexy drifter and Woodward, the school teacher who is 23 and still not married, are both so young and handsome and play off each other beautifully. The other actors give credible performances as well although Orson Welles is a little over the top at times. He certainly fills up the screen both in physical size and bombast. Angela Lansbury is charming as the local madam who provides pleasure for Welles who plays the rich landowner Varner. I don't know how true to Faulkner the plot is, not having read the stories in question, but something tells me the ending is distinctly not Faulknerian.

Southern accents are always tricky; occasionally they don't ring true here with the exception of Woodward's; but she's a native Southerner after all.

Set in Mississippi although shot in Louisiana, the film has an authentic feel and remains remarkably undated. It sizzles.",1093996800,17,1511,4.803846153846154
338994,4,6301599225,"I rated this film with four stars though on most measurable levels, it is worthy of maybe three. The screenplay as written is a montage, (some say mish-mash) of William Faulkner's literary works. Still, the film works..... most of the time. Jerry Wald's production has 1950's sensibilities written all over it. A real strength of this film lies in the charismatic on-screen performance of young Paul Newman's Ben Quick and his incendiary relationship with Orson Welles' Will Varner. It is said the editing room had to re-do much of Welles' dialogue to make it intelligible for the audience. Whatever. I am fascinated by virtually every word uttered in Welles' quirky interpretation of a portly, gravelly voiced redneck hell-bent to leave his greasy thumbprint on all who would come under his influence. For 62 year old Varner to race about town in a Jeep as his personal conveyance of choice completes the picture of a man unbowed in the presence of all others. Eager to marry his daughter off to perpetuate his legacy, Will encouraged Ben anyway he could. In all things, he could be demanding and callous, yet in a rare display of affection, Will uncharacteristically and tenderly explained to his sensitive daughter Clara, (Joanne Woodward) ""Sometimes the strong just rolls over the weak."" Angela Lansbury played Minnie LittleJohn, a retired women of the evening. As an inevitable consequence of age, her world weariness and palpable sense of urgency that time was running out expedited a patient and sincere pursuit of Will for his hand in marriage. Richard Anderson portrayed Alan Stewart, Clara's long-time supposed suitor, an elegant, tasteful and honorable southern gentleman. Outed by an impatient Varner, and forced to declare his sexual orientation, he had to finally declare his unsuitability for Clara's hand in marriage. To me, the one miscast major actor in this film was Anthony Franciosa as Will's disaffected son, Jody. It was difficult for me to accept a dark and somewhat ethic Franciosa as a privileged son of the deep south, though Lee Remick positively shined as his highly desirable sexually charged wife Eula. The obvious on-screen chemistry shared of Newman and Woodward in ""The Long, Hot Summer"" is the stuff of Hollywood legend. Those were real sparks of passion arcing between them, the camera just documented the fireworks for posterity. Their highly charged scenes make the price of admission all the more reasonable and justification enough for me to rate this film with 4 stars.",1066089600,3,2510,5.109489051094891
339055,3,6301599225,"""The Long Hot Summer"" was (for its time)a steamy study of sexual repression and sensual misbehavior.  It starred Paul Newman as a drifter accused of barn burning who sets up house-keeping with the daughter (Joanne Woodward) of a rich plantation owner (Orson Welles).  The on screen chemistry is certainly there and why not.  This film just happened to be the catalyst for the real life romance between Newman and Woodward.  Contextualizing the fact that the censors still reigned supreme during the time of its production, ""The Long Hot Summer"" still proved to be a smoldering, sexy drama fraught with tension and chaos.
THE TRANSFER: Fox has done a particularly nice job on remastering this movie.  Yes, the flicker of scene changes (inherant in all early Cinemascope films)remains present and yes, color consistancy leaves something to be desired.  But over all, colors are nicely balanced, if showing slight fading.  Contrast and shadow levels are well represented.  Pixelization, shimmering and edge enhancement, though all present, are kept to a bare minimum.  The audio is Stereo surround and, even though considerably dated, still manages to have a hearty kick in all of the speakers.
EXTRAS: Very nice - the Backstory featurette that details the production of the film, a Paul Newman gallery, original movietone snippet and the film's theatrical trailer.
BOTTOM LINE: This is a nice presentation and a pretty good film besides.  At the extremely economical price that Fox has advertised it at, ""The Long Hot Summer"" is guaranteed to burn up your DVD player.",1053388800,33,1565,5.150197628458498
339056,4,6301599225,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it. The TV-movie version of ""The Long, Hot Summer"" suffers from miscasting (Judith Ivey was passable, but just, and I can't decide if Don Johnson's attempt to fill Paul Newman's shoes represents touching bravery or misguided arrogance), dreadful accents, and jarring anachronisms.

This film, the 1958 original, leaves it in the dust. Newman and Woodward generate palpable heat, and Orson Welles--clammy, jowly, bullfrog-voiced, crudely vigorous--is unforgettable as a classically bullying, overbearing Southern patriarch. In contrast to the pallid TV remake, it features a top cast whose work transcends the sometimes creaky melodrama of the plot. Nearly every white Southern archetype is brought to life: the brutish, domineering, castrating patriarch; the arch, charming, coyly seductive belle with hot pants; the aging good-time girl, simultaneously randy and prim, with her eye on the prize of a rich widower; the hotheaded but weak son and heir, goaded to jealousy by his seductive, flirtatious wife and utterly dominated by his father, whom he both adores and despises; the sharp-tongued old maid, smoldering with repressed fire, who just needs a ""real man"" to take the place of her suspiciously lukewarm long-term suitor; and, of course, the roguish, charming, sexy, potentially dangerous outsider, spiritual heir to Rhett Butler, who gets both the community and the heroine in a lather. There's even a lynch mob--chasing a white man, for a change.

Skip the TV-movie remake, which at best is a clunky imitation, in favor of the classic--if for no other reason than to see Paul Newman, at the peak of his beauty, in an undershirt. If that's not inducement enough, it's also marvelously cast, scripted, acted, and directed, and it captures Southern family dynamics with humor, pathos, and wince-inducing accuracy. Florence King would be proud.",1050969600,39,1879,5.387755102040816
339057,4,6301599225,"Paul Newman plays another one of his cocky, dangerous characters in this story of a drifter who moves into a small Mississippi town dominated by fatcat Orson Welles.  Welles' own son, Anthony Franciosa is weak, and he likes Newman and wants to match him up with his staid daughter Joanne Woodward, but she's not interested ... or at least not at first.  Newman's high wattage star charisma is on display here as the man who manages to get out of tight spots and can spot an opportunity when it is presented.  Woodward is very good as the young woman who needs to let go and allow herself to live.  Welles dominates every scene he is in, with his characteristic bluster and dramatics a good fit for this character.  Lee Remick, as Franciosa's wife, and Angela Lansbury, as Welles longtime girlfriend, are both sadly underused.  The script has got some great bits of dialogue, and the main characters are allowed to develop quite well.  But the ending seems rushed, and the full dramatic potential of the town's confrontation with Newman and Welles is not allowed to play out enough.  The movie does evoke a Southern atmosphere, and this chance to see Newman and Woodward in their primes shouldn't be missed.",1033171200,13,1206,4.7368421052631575

339059,3,6301599225,"OK, this is the one everyone mixes up with ""Cat on A Hot Tin Roof."" It's the Tennessee Williams movie that was really based on William Faulkner, but still FEELS like Tennessee Williams.  It's the one where the Burl Ives role was played by Orson Welles. But the Paul Newman part is still played by Paul Newman--which no doubt is one reason for the confusion.
It's hard to imagine in 2001 how  revolutionary the (now) demure references Joanne Woodward makes to her decidedly repressed sexuality must have seemed in 1958.  And Lee Remick flouncing around in her slip and falling languidly into Tony Franciosa's eager arms must have seemed pretty racy at the time. (Of course, Lee and Tony had perfected the act in the previous year's ""Face In the Crowd."")  All of this seems pretty tepid nowadays. More's the pity, I guess.
As a time capsule, the movie's priceless.  Dramatically, though, the pacing could have been lots better.  This was only director Martin Ritt's third theatrical effort.  Although he is known for getting good performances out of his actors, the script here lets him and the cast down.  Dramatic scenes (Jody's attempted murder of his overbearing father; the attempted lynching of Ben Quick by the enraged townsmen) seem rushed and are ultimately more ludicrous than moving.  Potentially affecting, the movie is more often frustrating.
But as potboilers of the era go, ""Long Hot Summer"" remains a must see.  The chemistry between Woodward and Newman is evident in this, their first film together.  Remick continues her Southern belle shtick begun in ""Face in the Crowd"" (and that she'd revisit again in another Faulkner-based epic, ""Sanctuary"")  in a way surprisingly winsome for a gal from Quincy, Mass.  Orson Welles hams it up gloriously as ""Big Daddy,"" I mean, ""Will Varner.""  Fans of 50s and 60s American cinema will definitely want to take this one in.  Whether you want to BUY it or not depends on just how big a fan you are.",1004918400,5,1950,4.848942598187311
339060,5,6301599225,"Adapted from some William Faulkner stories, this 1958 film certainly lives up to its name. It is ""hot"". The setting is a small town in the Deep South and the characters familiar, but under the skillful direction of Martin Rich, they spring to life as complex, flawed and very human individuals. Paul Newman, in his prime then, is cast as Ben Quick, a young drifter who is taken under the wing of the town's patriarch, Will Varner, played by Orson Wells. Newman romances Varner's schoolteacher daughter, Clara, played by Joanne Woodward, and competes with Varner's son Jody, played by Anthony Franciosa, for the old man's respect and affection. Lee Remick is cast as Jody's pretty wife and Angela Lansbury plays Varner's lady friend. What a cast!
Both Paul Newman and Orson Wells exude the essence of macho in the finest southern tradition. I can almost smell all that testosterone right off the video screen. There's nothing politically correct about this story, as the strength of the women lies only in the way they can manipulate the men in their lives. And, in spite of Joanne Woodward's, declaration of how much she loves books, the audience knows that what she really wants is nothing less than the kind of man who will make her wake up smiling each morning. This was the first movie that Woodward and Newman made together and they married shortly thereafter and so the audience is treated to a very special chemistry between them. Newman's blue eyes sparkle and his sexiness comes through loud and clear when he takes off his shirt. His body is naturally rugged without the sculptured pumped and ripped muscles that have since become trendy. Orson Wells' outstanding performance is the glue that holds the story together. He plays the role of the powerful 60-year old patriarch with exceptional vigor and is completely believable even though he was only 43 at the time. He wears his bulk well and there's sparkle between him and Angela Lansbury. During the course of the film, it is his character that goes through the most changes and he plays this with a naturalness that makes this believable.
There's good writing, directing and close-up shots of the actors. And the story moved fast, holding my interest throughout. The camera also captured the distinctions between the dusty dirt farms and the luxurious mansion, but basically it focused on the people and the human drama. And the ending is a happy and satisfying one. I thought it was excellent.",997488000,38,2459,4.871121718377088
