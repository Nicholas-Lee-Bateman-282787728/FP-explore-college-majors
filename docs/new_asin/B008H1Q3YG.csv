She portrays a young widow that enthralls herself in work after the death of her beloved husband. She meets someone new, someone completely unexpected.

Was a little disappointed in the transitioning from the past to the present story line, it left a little more to be desired. Not a bad film, but in my opinion not a great one.

5160941,4,B008H1Q3YG,"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE UK BLU RAY VERSION (Released Aug 2012) ***

""Delicacy"" isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination - but nowadays is that rarest of digital beasts - a 'kind' film - a gently unfolding love story about two polar opposites who need to give each other a chance...

But therein lies some of this French movie's problems with critics and audiences alike (never mind the English subtitles). We're essentially being asked to believe what some would say is absurd - after the loss of her ludicrously handsome and beloved husband Francois (Pio Marmai) - the swanlike beauty Nathalie Kerr (Audrey Tautou) then falls in love with the office klutz - the balding cardigan-wearing Swedish clerk Markus Lundl (Francois Damiens). And of course in the real world - no such thing would happen. But I'd argue that David and Stephane Foenkinos' movie is better than that...

""La Delicatesse"" (the original French title) isn't a rom-com or even a comedy as the trailer clumsily tries to portray - it's rather more serious than that. It's a journey from heartbreak back to hope - and it's done with class and a deliberately languid pace. It comes with the usual office dynamics - the already-married boss Charles (Bruno Todeschini) consumed with the widowed prize he can't have - the gossiping secretary Chloe (a shockingly gorgeous Melanie Bernier) and outside of work - friends and their nosey partners who don't rate the social status of Nathalie's new male acquisition (and he's not even that pretty either).

Speaking of physical beauty and its grip on our world in 2011 - the script has a go at these social hypocrisies and often succeeds. But I was more impressed with other sublime and touching moments... When Nathalie returns after the funeral to her apartment and the blurry emptiness just hits her - when she picks up a friend's child in a playground and smiles for the first time in a long while - when she later gets an inexpensive but thoughtful gift from Markus that changes her perspective of him so completely. And their year-after-year relationship is allowed to grow slowly - talks on the office roof (dialogue above) - when Markus sees Nathalie's elegant neckline as they exit a restaurant - when Nathalie's elderly aunt greets them in the rain at her country cottage and remarks that he is ""a good man""...

The BLU RAY picture is good - beautiful in places - but hardly exceptional it has to be said. Defaulted to 1.85:1 aspect ratio it does at least fill the entire screen and the English subtitles are never unreadable. There are 15 deleted scenes (some quite substantial) and the 21 blooper reels where the cast has a giggle are a welcome blast (even having a light-hearted poke at ""The Artist"" on the last one).

The camera adores every second of Audrey Tautou - and sometimes her extraordinary beauty works against her - yet she imbibes her Nathalie with a hurt and longing that is wholly believable. When she sobs or delights - you feel both with an equal wallop. Francois Damiens does even better - never overplaying the ordinariness of his Markus - just letting it flow out slowly - but also allowing him those dizzy moments of seize-the-day or love will elude you. Very touching stuff...

Perhaps it's just me - but I can't help but feel that we've been so emotionally bludgeoned over the years by bad movies, violence and cruelty-as-cool - that something as genuinely lovely as ""Delicacy"" finds itself being poo-pooed and dismissed in certain quarters. I'd say take a chance on this one - it will reward you...

...And if Audrey Tautou or Melanie Bernier need a dish on their arms for a premier or a red carpet or two - once the female queue outside the hall door has died down and the football's over - I'm available (for a very reasonable fee).

5160942,3,B008H1Q3YG,"""I could go on holiday in your hair,"" moons a love struck Swede named Markus (Francois Damiens) to his co-worker, a beautiful French widow named Nathalie. If that sounds like an inappropriate comment to make at the office (to your boss, no less), you're right. Then again, it's not every day that your boss (bearing a remarkable likeness to Audrey Tautou) calls you into her office, springs from her chair without warning, plants a lingering, passionate smooch, then goes back to her desk as if nothing just happened. It's an anomaly that a slovenly nebbish like Markus is going to require a few days to process.

Whether or not you believe that a beautiful young widow who bears a remarkable likeness to Audrey Tautou would even consider throwing herself at a slovenly nebbish who bears a remarkable likeness to a French Chris Elliot is probably a good litmus test for whether or not you will be willing to sit through a romantic dramedy called ""Delicacy"", directed by siblings David and Stephane Foenkinos (adapted from David's novel). In an opening montage that vibes the films of Eric Rohmer, we get a recap of Nathalie's relationship with her late husband, the suavely continental Francois (Pio Marmai), from their initial Meet Cute at a quaint caf, to his untimely demise while out for a jog one fateful morning. The heartbroken Nathalie deals with her pain by becoming a workaholic.

And so it is that Nathalie registers just as much shock at her impulsive amorous advance on her own underling, as does Markus himself (who leaves her office dazed and confused). When he later screws up the courage to ask her if she truly wants to go down this road, Nathalie tries to backpedal. She doesn't know what possessed her. Her mind was elsewhere, etc. etc. ""You sound like an American. That's a bad sign,"" Markus deadpans, in the film's funniest line. This gets a chuckle out of Nathalie, breaking the ice.

Will this odd couple find true love? You'll have to watch to find out. You will have to be willing to suspend your disbelief, of course. Your willingness to go along with this fluffy but diverting affair also hinges on which camp you happen to be in regarding Ms. Tautou's saucer-eyed, Gallic pixie allure (which some are apparently immune to). There is some unevenness in tone, particularly stemming from an over-reliance on the gimmick of ""listening in"" to each character's Deep Thoughts (which aim for poetic heights but tend to crash-land just this side of a Hallmark greeting card), but it's not enough to sink the proceedings. The film is saved by Tautou and Damiens' onscreen chemistry; they both bring an endearing charm to their roles. Damiens imbues his shambling ugly duckling with a gentle humanity that helps us grok what Nathalie finds so appealing. Think of this film as a souffl, which, depending on what you bring to the table, can be an entree or a dessert. If you're the type who could bypass the entree and go straight to dessert, I think you will enjoy. Those without a sweet tooth will probably want to skip it.",1343174400,14,3041,4.777566539923955

After a lengthy isolation from men and avoiding any advances she slowly falls for the tall, quiet, almost reclusive gentle Swede.  Interesting.....but not captivating.  Some good comedy, some sad drama.  Overall, somewhat of a fantasy but still kept my attention to get through the movie.  Writing could have been better but Audrey Tatou clearly carries the movie with her acting and natural appeal.  Other characters are also well portrayed based upon their ""role"" in the film but without Audrey I doubt it would get near the positive reviews it earns.  It was nice that the film was not awkward to watch in front of teenage children (something I often dread with French movies due to ""unnecessary"" nude scenes).

The movie does not evoke the kind of emotions one would expect from such tragedies and sadness. The men who fall for her afterward are hard to watch. They are not attractive and it is hard to believe someone like Audrey would want to be with them. I had a hard time with the romance with the Swedish guy. Audrey is the kind of woman who could have her pick of handsome, successful men. Overall, the acting was good. The movie is a little disjointed in some places.

As a guy, I'm not really supposed to admit this, but after I watch a film with Ms. Tautou in it, my spirits are elevated by the time spent in her filmic company. I can't wait until the day cloning becomes a reality, and I can buy my very own Audrey Tautou on Amazon.com (free shipping with Prime) -- she's just that cool and companionable!

5161041,5,B008H1Q3YG,"This movie never overcomes its ambivalence of a serious consequential drama or spoof comedy. It does keep it core of existentialism never straying from remaining in the here and now. The ambivalence is disconcerting and frustratingly distracting. There are long stretches of introspection regarding angst and loss then there is a bump and the parody begins anew. It is almost as if the director decides to laugh at the audience for taking falling in love so seriously; but then the following scenes give a rebirth to the human condition of attraction, delight and imagining the possibilities. There is an unmasking of romance and yet a renewal in its credo of unifying with another human in passionate consumption. As frustrating as it is to get a handle on the thematic pathway, Audrey Tautou as the mid level executive stuck in her dispassionate pursuit of simply getting through life is simply marvelous. The plot, even though the movie is based on a novel, is very close to the Good Girl with Jennifer Anniston playing a woman on the opposite financial spectrum. Anniston did a fantastic job in a very serious movie about low income existence whereas Tautou move through her character's disintegration and reintegration to normalcy with a severely powerful presentation that it is easily forgotten this was Amlie in all her foolish joyances. Her romantic interest in the movie moves between buffoon and hero. The role is too comedic and stereotypical but in the hills and valleys of being enamored such is the goofiness of the human mind; we stumble and bumble until something works. The movie never quite explains the attraction as to not insult the audience intelligence.  This is gratifying viewing. It is also almost too fairy tale.",1463184000,,1740,5.02076124567474

5161127,5,B008H1Q3YG,"I've enjoyed this film several times now, having discovered it in August 2015. The honest humor and treatment of profound grief lends this story a gentle power. It ends with one of the sweetest ""understandings"" that I can ever imagine in a newly emerging relationship. The subtle strength of Tautou's character inspires me to trust my own feelings more that what others may impose as right. I highly recommend this FIL for natural introverts and those extroverts who love them.",1443139200,,477,4.975

5161131,3,B008H1Q3YG,"I liked Audrey Tautou in Amelie and since then I look out for other movies she's done.  Somewhat of a departure from the quirky character she played, Tautou tries for a more tragic role.  Maybe I missed something in this film but I just didn't see her as all that tragic.  Maybe the filmmakers thought that she should walk through life in a trance that is until she kisses one of her co-workers.  Perhaps this is an example of the rigid protocol of behavior that French people must endure?  No so since her co-workers were also trying to figure out how to behave around her after the death of her husband.  In any case, I felt the film missed the mark.",1442016000,2,652,4.347107438016529

A caveat to this review should be that I would probably be OK with watching a movie consisting of Audrey Tautou knitting for an hour an half, because there is something about her that intoxicates me.  Somewhere about midway, the movie took a completely unexpected turn, and I kept waiting for it to turn back but it never did.  And I found that pleasant. But maybe the film was built to cater to overweight Swedish-descent guys like me whose secret fantasy is to have Audrey Tautou descend from out of the blue and decide to carry on a relationship with us.",1438819200,,685,4.5528455284552845

5161170,5,B008H1Q3YG,"I love French romance/comedy films and this one didn't let me down.  It's a fun, light, romantic movie that has some beautiful shots of Paris and the countryside of France. The main character, Natalie, was a strong, beautiful woman.  She built quite a wall of protection around herself after losing her husband which made one think she was cold and selfish.  Once she began to allow herself to feel again, however, she became even more beautiful and began enjoying her life.  Her boss was a jerk; he crossed the line from the beginning telling her that he had feelings for her and that she 'owed' him.  But she never let him bully her and told him up front that she had no romantic interest in him.  And she really let him have it later in the movie - it was awesome how she stood up to him!

The result was a stro g message that keeps one realizing the paths we must take after a long mourning without a partner.

5161240,4,B008H1Q3YG,"Again, France wrests the romantic comedy genre from Hollywood accountants in a imaginative take on love and loss with a cast of actors that revolve around the charming Audrey Tautou in ""Delicacy."" A wonderfully romantic opening captures the depth and feeling of ""Nathalie"" as she shares her love-glow of engagement with her immediate family and co-workers. What she does when her handsome beau dies off-camera becomes the weight of the comedy. With an exuberant glow of engagement shared by her family and co-workers, her fiancee dies off camera. Her life is upturned and suspended. However, Nathalie battles the office gossip, an obvious swipe at Hollywood films or Ann Landers psychology by bestowing herself upon an awkward Swedish co-worker. In order to raise her spirits she does the same for this ordinary-looking chap with surprising results in her own life. Although this was an unusual step for such a naturally gorgeous creature to take, a career risk for her to abandon other good-looking hopefuls as well, perhaps it was about time to give hope to the underdogs of the real world. Together, they do make a workable couple. But I was let down in the final 10 minutes that resolved this romantic fantasy in a hide-and-seek play, that made me feel I was watching ""Roman Holiday"" for the 10th time where, instead of Audrey Hepburn going off with Gregory Peck, she chose Eddie Albert instead. The dream sequence could have been handled only by a Bergman. To me, it felt like an almost-complete romance with a patch of another story, leaving the office politics, sexual harassment possibilities dangling.",1432857600,2,1610,5.033707865168539

It is hard to lose someone you love, but it can be even harder to allow ourselves to move forward with our lives.  Delicacy depicts a lovely (but too, too thin) widow who refuses to let go of her grief.  She is her grief.  When she does find someone else he does not meet the expectations of her friends who have completely accepted her sadness and almost feed on it.  I really liked the oafish Swede who was sweet and kind and also very afraid of opening himself up to potential heartbreak.  The movie is on the slow side but not boring.  I enjoyed it very much.

5161395,5,B008H1Q3YG,"This French delicacy proves you don't need an enormous budget to craft a movie that is beautiful, clever and magical. I thoroughly enjoyed this from start to picture-perfect finish. While tragedy strikes early on, as the story develops you begin to feel that if you  can live in the present (at least some of the time) and stay true to your ideals and your heart, life will continue to surprise and delight! Audrey Tautou once again shows she's way more than just a pretty face - her emotions are raw and her persona relatable. I love that the film eschewed romcom conventions and celebrated the wisdom of appreciating goodness in others beyond a fancy faade. Francois Damiens is a revelation. Even when flying below the radar, his comical presence elevates every scene he's in. As the shy Swedish dumpling, it's impossible not to fall in love with him. In real life, seemingly opposite types attract now and again. Just as Markus could be spellbound by Nathalie, I found it as believable that she would be floored by his humility and humour and his overall dorky ways. If more people took their approach to relationships, it'd be a much happier world. I found the characterization of office life hilarious - and realistic in that workplace relations can be fraught with all kinds of drama and must be navigated delicately. The musical selections are the perfect accompaniment to this tale of rediscovering your joie de vivre after a great loss. So many subtly funny moments. Hooray for the underdogs. Hooray for storytelling that doesn't overcompensate with commercial gimmicks. This is a one-of-a-kind film that re-affirms your appreciation for both the brevity of life and seizing the golden opportunities - no matter what anybody else thinks - while you can.",1397260800,31,1762,4.9326599326599325

After the love of her life was killed in a car accident she goes into a shell and proceeded to concentrate on work only.  Suddenly for no apparent reason a man comes into her life, not handsome, not sexy, nothing like her former, and she kisses him.  She didn't even remember it afterwards.  But this caused a chain of events that had to run it own course.  As he ascends to the role of being her lover, he has to do battle with his demons as well as those who can't understand why she is choosing to be with him. He himself can't believe it, but rather than deny the obvious he decides to allow the chain of events to run their course.",1396742400,2,709,4.176470588235294

It's really a grand story of finding true love again once you think it's gone forever and a tale of opposites attracted to one another. Though the opposites are actually her first love compared to her second one. No one can believe she can go from a guy that looks like a french model to her coworker.

5161408,5,B008H1Q3YG,"What a sweet film. It's a subtle friendship and romance. Nathalie (Audrey Tautou) is married to a dreamboat Francois (Pio Marmai). They are well-suited, young and in love, and life is blossoming for them. The unbelievable happens, and Nathalie finds herself a widow. Work keeps her sane and alone, until one day when a co-worker Markus enters her office, and Nathalie does something irrational.

What now? Everyone can see that Markus (Francois Damiens) is clearly wrong for her and not like Francois on the surface. Except that he discerns Nathalie's virtue and compassion. But he's a bit gawky, not as handsome as Francois, and he's an underling perhaps lacking ambition.

It has been three years since Francois' death, but can Nathalie love another? This movie feels authentic. Tautou is captivating and Damiens makes you grin every time you see him. You care about this couple and want them to find a little happiness in this not always kind world.

I love to watch French films to improve my French, plus seeing the French background. This move is a delight, although low-key and subtle. It doesn't have quite the exuberance of AMELIE, one of my favorite movies of all time. But it has a quiet charm. 4.5 stars.",1386806400,3,1216,4.8647342995169085

5161420,2,B008H1Q3YG,"To me, this movie was about how Nathalie was more attractive than Markus. It makes a big deal out of a small thing. It's not that weird that people date each others not based solely on looks but on personality as well. It's not that radical of a concept. What kind of a world is this that people are only allowed to associate with other people of the same attractiveness? This is totally unrealistic.  I think whoever thought of this concept needs to have more faith in humanity. This is stating the obvious. This is like making a movie about a white girl dating a black man or vice versa, that takes place today. Sorry if that came off as racist.

Let me quote parts of the Wiki for this movie: ""Nathalie, a young very attractive woman is very much in love with a young very attractive man, Franois."" ""His confusion about this incident is because he is a native Swede (who has worked in France the past 15 years, with his parents living nearby), balding, an average looking guy, maybe 40 years old, and can not possibly imagine why someone like Nathalie would be interested in someone like him."" ""Nathalie is happy to see him and introduce him to her 'crowd', but they, all `attractive people', can not see what she sees in him"" ""Her boss calls Markus an ""ugly, insignificant guy"" Though these may sound ridiculous, there is literally no other way to describe this plot.

And of course, little Nathalie is in every way perfect. Guys are always fighting over her, everybody loves her, she is just a victim of her husband's death and so strong, such a hard worker. She literally has no internal struggles. She does not grow in any way. She is not relatable at all, because nobody else is a perfect goddess/robot.

In terms of cinematography, acting, a witty script, blah blah blah, really great, really cute.

I think this movie is an example of the majority of its characters, with the exception of the two main ones. It is pretty on the outside but ugly on the inside.",1374537600,6,1969,4.519662921348314

Brief Synopsis:
Nathalie, played by Tautou, is a captivating young woman who suffers a life altering loss. She attempts to cope independently, but that starts to change with the introduction of Markus, an awkward, yet charming co-worker. The relationship between the two is quirky and compelling, full of drama and humor.",1373068800,,659,5.149532710280374

It is funny and sad and romantic and heartbreaking and it was exactly what I was longing for when I set out to watch a movie tonight. It is a must see! I loved the end and it made me cry even more. I love the french for creating these sorts of movie, where even though love is heartbreak, love is also unimaginable joy.

I chose this film because I like French films, have long been a fan of Audrey,  and have come to expect great writing and real human emotion from European film producers. This one is a film for us average folk.",1367452800,,316,4.413793103448276
5161430,3,B008H1Q3YG,"This French ""romcom"" starring the enchanting Audrey Tautou, is an exercise in flimsy whimsy. Tautou plays, Nathalie, a young woman deeply in love with her husband who is inconveniently hit by a car when out jogging. The widowed Nathalie throws herself into work (we see her behind a desk dealing with stuff, heading a team of males and fending off the unwelcome advances of her boss -- but we never find out what all these people actually do. It's something connected to Sweden but what exactly we don't know.)

One day, she impulsively kisses Markus, one of her subordinates, a rather lumpy,  bald, Swede with perfect French played by Francois Damiens. He evidently views Nathalie as way out of his league -- and so do her friends and her boss. It's never explained exactly what his attraction is and why she felt impelled to passionately embrace him. But he's a fundamentally decent sort and he grows on us, the audience, as their relationship begins to blossom.

This souffl of a movie never really gets to grips with any strong emotion. Tautou is adorable (isn't she always?) but we don't really feel her grief or her love. She remains an enigma, defined by others. The final scene has Markus imagining Nathalie at different points in her life wandering through her grandmother's garden. We're invited to believe that yet another version of Nathalie is about to emerge.",1362960000,3,1373,4.834042553191489
5161431,4,B008H1Q3YG,"`La dlicatesse' is a lovely French dish written by David Foenkinos and directed by both David and Stphane Foenkinos. Much of the success of this slightly to the edge story of the vagaries of love and life as they intertwine is due to the presence of the irresistible charm and charisma of lead actress Audrey Tautou. She is able to take this story that at times seems impossibly off track and keep it grounded in her sense of lightness and focus, making us believe that what actually happens to this character is truly quite possible.

Nathalie Kerr (Audrey Tautou) is a successful businesswoman who happens to meet the rather unkempt but impish Franois (Pio Marma, an irresistibly charming actor) quite by accident (and an order of apricot juice) in a caf. Nathalie is literally swept off her feet and rather quickly this spontaneous meeting of hearts results in blissful marriage. The perfect scenario ends tragically when Franois is accidentally kill. Nathalie's heart seems irreparable and she trudges through life bathed in grief and longing.  Even her handsome boss Charles (Bruno Todeschini) can't woo her: Nathalie is frank in her objection that Charles is a married man. Then the door to her office opens and a subordinate nerdy appearing geek named Markus Lundi (Franois Damiens) walks in and Nathalie impetuously greets him with a passionate kiss - an act she represses thinking that such a deed was impossible. And this apparent one-sided accidental occurrence lightens Markus' life and he is committed to falling in love with the resistant Nathalie. The `courtship' leads to Nathalie's recognition that love and happiness can happen in the most unexpected places and ways.

Summarizing the story makes it sound trite and bordering on silly, but it is the delicately French manner in which it is told that makes the film so refreshingly endearing. The entire cast is first class (director Stphane Foenkinos is best known as one of France's best casting directors!) but it is the glimmering lightness of Tautou and Marma and Damiens that make it sail.  A perfect Valentine. Grady Harp, February 13",1360454400,4,2108,5.0315186246418335

8527829,5,B008H1Q3YG,"This was another outstanding performance by Audrey Tautou.

Audrey Tautou plays Nathelie, a young woman whose husband Francois dies.  She is devastated.  Friends and family try to help her.  She just crawls into herself and her job.  Her boss tries to take advantage of Nathelie's perceived vulnerability.  After a few years, people just expect her to be alone and devoted to her work.  But when a Swedish co-worker, Markus, shows up in her office, she learns to open up to men and eventual love again, but it's a long and bumpy ride.  When her grandmother approves of Markus and tells her it's OK to move on, Nathelie makes that big move to love.

Tautou plays Nathelie perfectly, with a constant scowl on her face.  When she realizes she's in love, her face lights up and so does the movie.  This is not a true rom-com and certainly not a comedy.  It's a drama with a few funny scenes.  It grapples grief with a serious undertone.  It touches on office gossip, grief, emotional vulnerability and how people expect certain behaviors from others.  It's well-acted, written and directed.  In the end one feels good for the outcome.

This is a lovely movie to watch for anyone who is grieving the loss of a loved one.",1501459200,,1215,4.629107981220657
8527830,4,B008H1Q3YG,"Not really a romantic comedy as such, but rather a hauntingly beautiful story of someone finding their way after losing someone they loved.

Somewhat stylized in places, and definitely open ended, the overall feel was very genuine and dealt with issues common to everyday life. The married boss who looks on bereavement as an opportunity was a particularly unpleasant aspect but I admired the way that Nathalie deals with him at every step.

Also totally love the grandma, who seems to be the only person who gets why Nathalie is attracted to gentle and awkward Markus.

Rather a sad commentary on society in general that her coworkers and friends all feel like they are entitled to an opinion on who she chooses to find warmth and companionship with, rather than simply being happy that she has finally been able to move past her grief. It is clear to anyone with any sense that Markus has exactly the right blend of silliness and humour, gentleness and awkwardness, to appeal to a wounded Nathalie. Instead of seeking to possess her, he instead tries to understand her, which is probably the most romantic thing of all.",1500681600,,1121,4.7979274611398965
