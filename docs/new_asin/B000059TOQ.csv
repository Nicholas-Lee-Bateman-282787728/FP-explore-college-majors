So good in fact, this film got us a contract with a Los Angeles distributor. Bad dubbing, so what! What the hell do you expect from a kung fu movie? I have neither the time nor space to go into the ever-broken camera, the 1 man film crew (me), the edit studio that shut us down because we ran out of money, the actors who quit halfway through filming, and the other ten thousand problems that almost killed the project. The fact is, we got it done and now its available worldwide. Sure, we would have hoped for a better film, but who would finance a film by a black filmmaker that did not involve the ghetto or rap music? I'd say we were pretty bold and ambitious for even trying. Give credit where its due. If I make a stinky film with millions of dollars, you can blast me all you want. I piece together a film on half a shoestring, hopes and prayers, you'd better think about that before casting stones. For the record, ""Mister Laughing barfer"", negative reviews don't bother me, but the question remains: how many films have you done? P.S. My new film ""ROOM 13:The Terrorist Project"" is headed for the Sundance Film festival. Even George Lucas' first film was a crappy 16mm sci-fi shlocker. Oh, to be in such grand company pleases me no end.",1090886400,3,1388,4.338461538461538
