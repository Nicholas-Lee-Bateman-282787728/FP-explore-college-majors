8218097,5,B000VD5HNG,"This is an eye opener of the history of African-Americans. I watched this DVD with my cousin and it opened up my eyes to evils of racism and the struggles that African-Americans had to deal with since arriving in this country as chattel slaves. It also made me aware of the racism that still goes on today with the Tea party movement and anti-Obamaism, as well as the liberal use of the N word in Rap music and the racism that often centers around that culture. When I have kids I will definitely have them watch this film and the Pulitzer Prize winning film Eyes On The Prize.",1299801600,4,577,4.351851851851852
