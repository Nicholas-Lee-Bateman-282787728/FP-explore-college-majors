2682129,5,B000K2VILI,"I highly recommend this video for anyone who finds themselves in front of an audience, particularly for the business person looking to improve their influence on their colleagues.  The real value of this video is that it provides clear, precise actions that any speaker can easily learn and integrate into his or her own presentations.

Although I was not expecting this video to keep my interest for the whole 90 minutes (I really struggle to make it through the training films at work), I found it kept my attention from beginning to end.  Mr. Jefferys breaks down the art of speaking well into digestible pieces that are presented in an entertaining enough way as to keep your attention the whole way through.

I found it very valuable to my own business skills - in fact, I got compliments on the very first presentation I gave after watching the DVD, something I had NEVER gotten before.  I have no doubt that every business person could improve their own presentation style by incorporating these techniques.

Valuable and entertaining - a great combination.",1220832000,2,1064,4.883333333333334
2682130,5,B000K2VILI,"I purchased this dvd for my 16yr old son. He ran for Governor of the Texas-Oklahoma Key Club in April and finished 2nd. Many people approached me saying he was by far the best qualified candidate but the one elected was on the debate team and a good speaker where as my son looked down,stammered and did not come across well. My son then wanted to run for the Key Club International Vice President position that has over 237,000 members in 4,600 schools in all 50 states and 9 foreign countries. I thought it was impossible but agreed if he would use this dvd and learn how to be an effective speaker. He competed in Orlando FL on July 12-15th and won the election. I could not believe my eyes as I saw him speak to a crowd of 1,600 attendees. This dvd transformed him in less than 8 weeks. We recommend this for everyone.",1185235200,9,822,4.309677419354839
2682131,5,B000K2VILI,"This DVD is wonderful! I'm an experienced media trainer in Australia who has learnt a whole lot from watching Doug's presentation. His technique for imparting messages is flawless and his key points are simple yet so effective.
I highly recommend this video to anyone who wants to perfect the art of presenting. I will watch it time and time again with the hope that each time a little more of Doug Jefferys' comfortable confident, authoritatve style will rub off on me.

2682132,5,B000K2VILI,"I am a technical trainer by trade.  After some very disparaging and pointed criticism of my presentation style, I videotaped myself to see if these harsh comments had any merit.  The criticisms were dead on!  I could barely watch myself.  My focus seemed scattered, I kept rambling on and on, and the so called ""rapport"" that I thought I had with the audience was all in my mind.  To top if off, I appeared very nervous, which led to the obvious discomfort of the audience.  There were a lot of pained expressions in the audience.

I was pretty distraught.  Worse than that, I had another important training presentation in less than a week.  I did some hasty internet searches to find some kind of comprehensive public speaking training and lucked upon this DVD.  The DVD cover purported to show you ""everything you need to know"" about how to deliver presentations and keep the audience with you ""every step of the way.""

I got the 90 minute DVD overnighted to me and watched it as soon as I got it.  I was prepared for a lot of the typical public speaking conventions - make eye contact with the audience, etc.

I was prepared to be quite bored by the DVD but was willing to sit through it because I was desperate.  Also, I am an insanely compulsive note taker and fully expected to jot down all the useful bits of information I could get as I watched the DVD.

I was wrong on both accounts.  I was absolutely riveted by the speaker, Doug Jeffreys.  I could see at once that the unconventional but totally sensible techniques he showed were immediately useable.  More impressive that that, I didn't have to take any notes.  The presentation was so effective that I actually learned by just watching and listening to him.  As a trainer, I absolutely aspire to this!

I took public speaking classes in college and I've read a few books over the years on public speaking.  I have NEVER come across the simple but effective approach he uses.  He also explained quite clearly why this approach works.

That sealed the deal for me and I immediately applied my techniques to a training presentation I had days later.

I was taken aback by the reaction I got from my audience.  I noticed that many people were looking at me intensely - and their gaze was not letting up!  After the presentation was over, a few of them came up to me and actually thanked me for my effective training.

Since then, I have had quite a few more training sessions and each one has been overwhelmingly positive.  I get comments like ""I thought I was going to be bored to tears but you had me interested the entire time"" or ""this was the best presentation I've seen"".  The funny thing is I haven't changed the content of my training.  The only change is the presentation skills I acquired from the one-time viewing of the DVD.

I give the DVD 5 stars out of 5 because it does what it purports to do - show you ""everything you need to know"" about how to deliver presentations.  I cannot recommend it enough for anyone who will have to speak in front of an audience.",1174435200,19,3035,4.469945355191257
2682133,5,B000K2VILI,"As someone who has been giving financial planning seminars for 20 years, I have purchased a number of books, videos and attended numerous seminars on presenting to groups. This video is the first I truly feel gave me my money's worth. Mr. Jefferys approach to public speaking especially regarding eye contact and pacing one's delivery in away that makes it easier on you and the audience are nothing shy of awesome. Unlike some training videos that have put me to sleep.

Mr. Jefferys delivers this knowledge in such an entertaining way that it keeps you thoroughly engaged right to the very end. I was able to put some of these techniques learned in a seminar delivered 1 week after watching the video for the second time. Not only did I get a better response from my audience than from any seminar I had delivered over the prior 7 years but many people came to me afterwards to compliment me on the quality of my delivery skills. I recommend this video to anyone who must speak to groups and connect in a way that earns trust",1170633600,4,1027,4.551351351351351
8154090,5,B000K2VILI,"LOVE THIS DVD!  I was once afraid to speak in public,,,,BUT...this DVD alone changed all that, and started my career as a Seminar Presenter.  GREAT INFO HERE!  Lost the DVD in a move, and bought another one.  ITS THAT GOOD!",1445299200,,223,4.5
8154091,5,B000K2VILI,"I have been fortunate enough to have a job that requires me to deliver presentations on a regular basis and I take the business of effective public speaking very seriously.  Every presentation is an opportunity to learn, improve and gain a greater appreciation of what made a good presentation really fly or perhaps understand what may have gone wrong in the (hopefully few) instances that a presentation felt mediocre.

To that end I have devoured numerous books, podcasts and videos on this topic over the years and for my money ""Killer Presentation Skills"" by J. Douglas Jefferys is THE definitive text and instructional video.

We have all seen presenters that really stood out and left a lasting impression - that's why you can still remember them even now.  But what was the anatomy of a strong delivery and more importantly can it be bottled?  The answer is YES, it can and that is what KPS  explains so eloquently.

It's also the DVD that keeps on giving as I find watching this video the night before a large presentation is the perfect preparation for helping me get ""in the zone"" and feeling quietly confidant about my delivery.",1389571200,,1139,4.780612244897959
8154092,5,B000K2VILI,"Douglas Jefferys says that after watching his DVD you will know what 99% of speakers don't know.  I put into action the skills he taught in his DVD the next time I spoke to an audience; I have never felt so connected to an audience as I did when I used these skills. I felt connected as I never have before because I was now only focusing on performing the skills that keep an audience interested.

In this DVD Douglas Jefferys explains his presentation skills in a relaxed manner and he gives examples of each of the skills that make them easy to understand.

I learned the three-cornerstones of delivering a speech.  Every speech must have all three in order to insure your audience gets what you're telling them.

I learned to focus on using a three-step technique during every moment of a speech.  Using these three-steps is what connected me to my audience as I've never experienced before.  These three-steps help to assure the audience hears what I am saying without them wandering-off thinking of something else.

This DVD combines Douglas Jefferys giving this same presentation at three different locations in front of three different audiences.  You will see him giving a section of the presentation to one-audience for a period of time and then the DVD will switch to another filming location while the same thought is being delivered.  This kept my interest in watching the DVD because as the information was seamlessly given, the location kept changing.

Helping you to achieve confident delivery during every moment of a speech is the focus of Douglas Jeffery's DVD.

(I've watched Douglas Jeffery's other DVD called Conquering Death by PowerPoint.  This 60-minute DVD gives excellent guidelines to creating PowerPoint presentations that effectively gets your point across to your audience.)",1338163200,,1805,4.996655518394649
8154093,5,B000K2VILI,"Purchasing this DVD was a tough decision for me.  It was easy enough to find, doing a Google search for ""presentation skills"", but when I came upon the Amazon page I was immediately struck by the fact that there were 8 five-star reviews and 4 two stars.  How, I wondered, could people be so decisively split on their opinions?  I will admit that I am one of those people who is strongly influenced by product reviews, and usually when I see just a few bad reviews I'll decide to try another product.

But when I read the mostly positive reviews, I immediately identified with those people who seemed to have been transformed by viewing this DVD.  I, too, have long suffered from an almost overwhelming fear of public speaking, and with a recent reorganization at my company I knew I had to seek help.  I have read that many people who we consider to be great speakers, like Churchill and Bill Clinton, were originally very poor speakers, but who also knew that speaking well was something that could be learned, and they did.

Anyway, I went ahead and purchased it, and I have to tell you it was the best investment I've ever made in my career.  Knowing what I do now, I wish I had skipped the whole process of getting my executive MBA and just watched and practiced the techniques in this DVD.  I have given only three presentations since my ""acquiring The Skills"", as Jeffreys calls it, but the results were exactly as he claims: I feel as comfortable standing before a group as I do sitting and talking with colleagues at lunch, and people come up to me afterwards to tell me how much they felt that I really cared about their understanding the material.  And as he also notes, now that I know what I'm doing, every time I speak, I feel I get a little better.

When I went back and re-read the negative reviews, I realized that the people submitting them must have either not been capable of understanding the material, or were just plain misfits looking for a venue to vent.  One reviewer seems to have been reviewing an entirely different piece of work, as his complaint is how he can't do the PowerPoint exercises when there is nothing in this DVD about PowerPoint!  Another one mentions that the video differs from the trailer, even though Amazon posts no trailer.

Don't get me wrong - I appreciate Amazon giving me the opportunity to express my opinion, and the process should be open to all comers, but the process might be better served by some system of reviewing the reviews so that buyers could at least be guaranteed of getting the facts.

My advice to people struggling to speak to groups: buy this DVD!",1327622400,,2619,4.530785562632697
8154094,2,B000K2VILI,"I purchased this DVD and have had MAJOR difficulties reproducing the results that are being demo'd on the DVD.  I am pretty tech savvy and I am finding myself completely frustrated at the moment.  I have watched DVD multiple times and I'm following along step by step, yet it's not working.  I have a more recent version of PPT, but that really shouldn't be an issue in my mind.  Too bad it's too late for a refund.  Give it shot if you own PPT 2007, but I wouldn't bother wasting your money if I were you.  It's hardly worth the aggravation for the steep price that you are paying.  Sorry to say that I am very dissatisfied.  So my recommendation is to not waste your money and look elsewhere.",1323734400,3,694,4.325581395348837
8154095,2,B000K2VILI,"I am not totally convinced after watching this you will make KILLER PRESENTATIONS.  The video is a compilation of many sessions edited (not well) together,in fact at some points it is very distracting.

The presenter gives you techniques to follow, and then he doesn't do them himself, which to me is a bit hypocritical.

It is not the best video on presentation skills, but there are some valid points.  I would not recommend this video as ""the"" video on presentation skills, but take what you can from it.",1320278400,4,507,4.7272727272727275
8154096,5,B000K2VILI,"About three years ago, I stumbled upon the Youtube video labeled Killer Presentation Skills. I was looking for something to show my Freshman Composition students before they delivered their one and only required ""speech"" for my general education class. I hit the jackpot with this video. The quality of my students' 6 to 8 minute presentations skyrocketed. No one used a podium. Everyone was engaged and engaging. One student looked and sounded like he was a professional presenter. I've used the video every class since with amazing results. I thought it was about time I praised Mr. Jeffery's presentation publicly.",1319068800,3,617,5.18
8154097,2,B000K2VILI,"i am disappointed with my dvd copy of 90 minutes to  killer presentation skills. i realize that many people are very satisfied with this product.....maybe they received a different version than the one i got. Firstly large parts of the 7 minutes trailer of the program are completely missing in my version .How do i know this ?i noticed that the trailer had green slides in the presentations whereas mine had blue ones and lets not forget the missing scenes.

  Is the trailer advertising for the 1st edition or is it the portion of the program that was edited out in my version?Is there a difference between the american version of this program and the international version?If there is, they should have mentioned it or in the ideal situation let us choose which version we the customer prefer. If the trailer is advertising for the first edition they should replace it with a new trailer for the 2nd edition , so that it actually represents what is on the second edition of the dvd! Also my version only runs for about 76 minutes , whereas on amazon it says the dvd has an 84 minute running time. Is this the additional footage that was edited out?

  The main thrust of this program is delivery. So know what you're buying when you get this. It is not the A-Z of speech making , its more like the A-Y  of speech DELIVERY.In that way it is unbalanced ,it does not cover speech preparation/writing or content gathering in any depth. However it is excellent at what it it does  teach (Speech Delivery).

  What irritates me most about this dvd , is the fact that what is advertised does not correspond to the actual program. Its like watching the trailer for a blockbuster film , which advertises arguably the best parts of the film. Then going to the actual film and finding that all those best parts from the trailer  have been edited out! The film may not be  bad but what gets to you is that you did not get what you wanted or expected! You did not get what had lured you to watch the film in the first place !Thats exactly how i feel about  this dvd!",1255132800,3,2056,4.430851063829787
8154098,5,B000K2VILI,"I've attended a couple classes/seminars in the past about how to give a presentation, but this was much better.  It covered ideas that I had not seen before, and it was also a great refresher of the ideas that I had seen.  The presentation was very well organized, dynamic, and entertaining as well as educational.  It also went more in-depth than other presentations I have seen on topics such as making eye contact with one person at a time vs ""spraying"" the audience with the eyes. The presentation was filmed at three live seminars, so it was like gettimg the best of all three, plus a few comments on the side as well.",1248739200,,623,4.495575221238938
8154099,2,B000K2VILI,"This DVD was so disappointing. I purchased it based on the recommendation of the reviewers. First, it flips through three different locations, which is annoying. Secondly, it covers just the basics of presenting. Rapport requires far more advanced skills that are suggested by a reviewer. There is no significant content substance from an advanced speaker's prespective. While the presenter is very good in both style and delivery, you can glean this information off any public speaking website. His language skills, humor and pace are excellent, but when you boil down the common knowledge content, you feel a bit ripped off for paying the hefty price of $99.00. Id' give the content a 1 star. His style is deserving of more, but the price really should have been around $59.00 in my opinion. So I'm giving the product only 2 stars. Also, his marketing staff should make it clear this is beginner stuff.",1245628800,6,904,4.953947368421052
