8240876,5,B00117OGDS,What a great video to introduce your non-players to what a mountian dulcimer is and can do. David Schnaufer (RIP) was a maga-star in the dulcimer world. The other personalites show the awesome versatility of the dulcimer. There are many cds available for the dulcimer but very few dvds and this just mite be the best. If your a player you'l want to make more time for practice after viewing this dvd,1318982400,2,399,4.555555555555555
8240877,2,B00117OGDS,"David Schnaufer was undoubtably the most diversely talented dulcimer player of our time.  I took classes from him and have every album he produced or contributed to.  I was excited when I thought I might see him play once again!  This DVD is 75% talk and 25% music. There is not a single song that is completely played without the interruption of boring narrative.  Its a short 28 minutes, and could serve as a basic introduction to the dulcimer and a quasi-eulogy to David.

It would have been worth it if David would have been featured playing even one song, or playing alongside of the quartet...

I hope the quartet will produce a music album or video to redeem this talking video.  Underneath the narratives, the music showed amazing potential. And yes it was great to see David once again...

If you are looking for amazing music, buy one of his albums...you won't be disappointed.",1245283200,,887,4.67741935483871
8240878,5,B00117OGDS,"I received a copy of ""The Nashville Nobody Knows"" DVD featuring the Nashville Dulcimer Quartet and David Schnaufer as a Christmas present.  I've been playing the mountain dulcimer myself since the mid-1980's, and David Schnaufer was one of my main influences.  His mastery of the instrument was unsurpassed, and he inspired legions of dulcimer players.  This video was filmed shortly before his untimely passing in 2006, and so represents one of  his last interviews.  His passion for the instrument was infectious, as was his desire to share its music with the world, and that is clearly on display here.  David was always at the forefront of ""pushing the envelope"" for the instrument.  It was a remarkable day when he became the first ""dulcimer professor"" at Vanderbilt's Blair School of Music.  Through those connections, he was able to realize his vision of creating the Nashville Dulcimer Quartet with four of his students: Sandy Conatser, Natasha Deane, Lee Rowe, and Linda Sack.  The DVD includes in depth interviews with each of the members, as well as David, and describes how they came together, and something about the process of arranging for this unique instrument.  As David says, the mountain dulcimer is the ""wild animal of the musical kingdom"", that has never really been ""tamed"" by a continuous evolution common to other instruments.

The real ""magic"" of the DVD lies in the music this talented group of musicians makes.  Much of the footage is from a live performance the group did at Sutton's General Store in Granville, TN.  We are treated to their unique arrangements of tunes like ""Whiskey Before Breakfast"", ""Barlow Knife"" (with David on jaw harp), a ""jazzy"" version of ""Old Joe Clark"", and a beautiful medley of ""My Pretty Quadrille"" paired with ""Elk River Blues"".  My favorite piece on the DVD is an absolutely jaw-dropping arrangement of ""Drowsy Maggie"" - it really ROCKS, both literally and figuratively!  There is a special chemistry that exists between the members of the quartet that is captured on the DVD.  The combination of their individual talents, the dulcimer's unique voice, and David's inspiration and vision have given us a glimpse of what this simple little 3-stringed box is capable of.

This is a ""must have"" DVD for anyone interested in the mountain dulcimer, the music it makes, and one of the most visionary and inspirational players and teachers the dulcimer community has ever known.
