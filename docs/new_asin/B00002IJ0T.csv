The dvd is great for nostalgia, and i like ocean dub uo until Goku fights frieza, then i do funimation. Dvd i bought was in great condition. Enjoy.",1469750400,,385,4.746268656716418

7915762,5,B00002IJ0T,"Compared to the remastered and the blue ray version of dbz, this old ocean dub version beats them both hands down. Dirt cheap and worth EVERY penny and worth watch, the classics are never tiring, and yet there r a few like this left in the world,get this version of dbz now, relive the old memories of the greatest action back show ever!!!",1337299200,2,339,4.396825396825397
7915763,5,B00002IJ0T,songokoussj4 i believe made a small mistake. when The Title of this is Super Sayin!? they are guessing is he one and the answer is no. Vegeta thought he was a Super Sayin because of how stronge he was not but we learn later on that SSJ1 or super sayin1 form comes with a change and that change is the Hair is Blonde but looks more more like Dark yellow when powered up with Green eyes which in some of the series their eyes are blue and i would say they were blue but the eye are really suppose to be green and their hair sticks straight up. There are Middle forms between SSJ1 and SSJ2 which is called The Ascended Sayin Forms also know as the  Ultimate Super Saiyan forms or also known as USSJ. There are TWO Ultimate Super Saiyan forms and that is USSJ1 and USSJ2. USSJ1 or also known as Ultimate Super Saiyan form 1 is much stronger than the Super sayin. The hair (which is blonde or a dark yellow when powered up) sticks Up more than SSJ2 or at lest on Vegeta and the muscles grow larger. USSJ2 or Ultimate Super Saiyan form 2 is much stronger than USSJ1 but is slower due to the fact that the muscles grow much larger than USSJ1. and the hair sticks staight up like like USSJ1. The the secound form is SSJ2 or super sayin 2 which makes the hair a little bit longer and more spickier than SSJ1 when it stands up on end and small lighting shocks flash around their body. SSJ3 of super sayin3 which is  The Third form has the small lighting shocks flashing around the body and the face changes form as well. The hair is Much Much longer and flows straight down their back and the hair spicks out at the ends. Then you have SSJ4 which is the strongest form and last one they reach. The tail grows back in this form and Red fur grows all over the body like an ape exspect for the chest like an ape. The hair is a Jet Black color and the hair is larger than SSJ1 and SSJ2 and spicks out at the end. The eyes like black or some people would say dark brown because dark brown looks black a little bit with an olive color type circle around it or it's a yellow color around it. but there is a pre-super sayin form which is before super sayin. This form is Only seen in the Lord Slurg Movie of dragon ball z. Oozaru and Oozaru gold  is not a super sayin forms but does increase the power by alot. Oozaru happens when they sayin has his tail and looks as a full moon or something that look like a full moon.  Oozaru Gold is caused when looking at the full earth. but the Oozaru Gold form might be due to turning Oozaru after becomeing super sayin some people call is the super sayin form or Oozaru which it could be. There are parts that the Sayin do that are not part of sayin forms. Kai Ken is not a Sayin form. Kai Ken is a powering up move learned from King Ki Nether is the Mystic form part of the Sayin forms which only Gohan does after old kia trains with him or gives him that. The Mystic form Gohan goes though make him stronger than the SSJ3 form but his hair stays black and sticks up like the SSJ2 form and the eyes also turn green like the in the super sayin form and lighting shocks flash around the body.,1056240000,5,3114,4.091653027823241
7915764,2,B00002IJ0T,Most of the reviews complain that Goku isn't actually ssj in this episode.  They are right.  It is called super saiyan becuase Vegeta *thinks* Goku is a super saiyan.  Not because he is.  I only gave it two stars because the whole namek saga is very boring to me.,1055808000,,263,4.3061224489795915
7915765,4,B00002IJ0T,"First of all I'd like to comment on the last review.
In this DVD Goku does NOT transform into a Super Saiyan.
A SSJ is when the hair turns blond, a SSJ2 is when the hair is blond and there are waves of electricity around you, a SSJ3 is when the face changes and the hair grows very long (still blond), and a SSJ4 is when the hair is black and the whole body is covered with fur except for the chest. But ignore the last one. Anyway, most of the episodes around this time were really boring, the whole Namek Saga was boring. But I really enjoyed seeing Goku return after his friends were getting their butt kicked. It's realy great when he makes a joke out of the Ginyu Force. So if you are looking for the DVD where Goku goes SSJ for the first time, this is not it. Bt it's still a good DVD none the less.",1023580800,4,805,4.0062111801242235
7915766,4,B00002IJ0T,"maybe if you were to realize that they were guessing that he was a SSJ, you wouldn't make an idiot out of yourself.  Outside of that, these were great, a good selection of episodes, and some good DBZ.",964656000,,200,4.2631578947368425
7915767,4,B00002IJ0T,"After the arrival of the ginyu forces kririn, gohan and their new found  ally vegeta combined forces to protect the dragonball from getting into the  hands of freeza! But unfortunately they failed and capt. ginyu got hold of  the dragonball. It is here where these 4 episodes begin. This is one of the  best part of the Namek Saga! The episode shows how vegeta, kririn, and  gohan gets humiliated  by recoome (watch the video and find out)their power  is no match for the 3 ginyu forces(recoome, verter and geez). But  fortunately son gokou finally arrived, and he gets to show these nasty guys  who he really is..a Super Saiyan! The fighting scenes are great, see gokou  devastate his opponent without even using his real power! You should buy  this if you love DBZ and for first timer you'll get hooked! I gave it 4  stars because the battle ain't over...see for yourself!",961027200,4,874,4.677631578947368
