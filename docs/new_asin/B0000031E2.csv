8565925,5,B0000031E2,"This video is a must-have for any parents looking to encourage their children in the things of the Lord...even at a young age.  Our three sons LOVED this video from the age of 2-5 til about 8 years old.  Our sons are now married with kids of their own...and asking mom and dad to see if we can find it for them to share with their kids...even today!  All the Psalty the PsalmBook videos are great.  My kids enjoyed the ""Live Action"" ones as opposed to the cartoon.  Now...we're getting them for our grandchidren!",1211673600,,512,4.404255319148936
