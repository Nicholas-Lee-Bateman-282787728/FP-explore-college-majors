8201703,5,B00030ASFY,"This tape is so good I almost can't describe how good it is. It takes you from the 1940's through the 1990's. The people fetured in the viedo are Ted Williams, Yaz, Carlton Fisk, Jerry Rice, Fred Lynn, Dwight Evens, Mo Vaughn, Tony Conigliaro, Jimmy Fox, and many others.(I probably spelled some names wrong) It highlights the best homerun moments in Red Sox history, such as the Fisk world series homerun, Ted Williams numerous last at-bat homeruns. It also has information about the Red Sox that I had never heard of before, and every time I watch it I learn something new. I strongly recomend this tape to any Red Sox fan young or old. 5 Stars",1177632000,,646,4.52991452991453
