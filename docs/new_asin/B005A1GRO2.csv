4633042,5,B005A1GRO2,I have all 18 sets of Midsomer Murders and absolutely love the show! I began collecting years ago and am still greatly involved in the show. Time will tell if the new Barnaby can maintain the interest like Nettles. Great British Mystery series!,1316217600,45,244,4.6976744186046515
4633043,5,B005A1GRO2,"Perfection achieved long ago in Midsomer Murders. Series 19 with 4 episodes Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby being played by John Nettles. He has toughness toward crime, but softness slips out occasionally. The combination makes watching suspenseful murder mysteries a pleasure. It is murder mystery in Midsomer County, the quaintest little village settings you will ever see, on drama shows or travelogues. Multiple murder mayhem has been happening from day one, 1997 (show's trademark). There was one show exception, to my memory, but it had a handful of potential murder investigations. Is anyone left to arrest in Midsomer?

If you are new to Midsomer Murders and CI Barnaby, then hold on to your hat, and I'd strongly recommend buying one of the box sets already available. There is also a set of 10 episodes selected by star Nettles, as his favorite for different reasons and each has an introduction by the star that adds even more interest to the episodes. That's another good way to introduce yourself to this saga of murder.

Wife Joyce is still in the picture, making moments of each episode a homey experience, but not for long. Every phone call seems to be a new murder, and a call away from the delightful cooking that Joyce provides for her love. Barnaby keeps his helper, DS Jones (Jason Hughes), very busy. Smashing series, Spot ON since the very first episodes. But can the show survive without Barnaby (Nettles)? We'll be finding out soon enough. But not in Set 19. One episode does give viewers a look at Barnaby's cousin, DCI John, who will head the shows in a time of the future, somewhere beyond Set 19.

4 longer-than-feature-length; and all with SUBTITLES included. Same old guaranteed entertainment, proven by this show's record.
Guest stars aplenty. As much a part of Midsomer Murders as the multiple murders and plots themselves.

Episode titles:
THE MADE-TO-MEASURE MURDERS  .....Death of a tailor, just to begin things.
guest stars Philip Bretherton (As Time Goes By), Nicholas Jones (Little Dorrit, Iron Lady) & James Wilby (Island at War)
THE SWORD OF GUILLAUME  ..........Here's where the future Midsomer Murder investigator head (Neil Dudgeon) is seen working along side DCI Tom Barnaby.
stars Tim McInnerny (Notting Hill)& Lucy Cohu (Becoming Jane)
BLOOD ON THE SADDLE  .....If it sounds a bit ""Wild West""-like, it is.
stars Richard Harrington (Lark Rise to Candleford), Kenneth Cranham, Pip Torens (Dorian Gray), Malcolm Storry
THE SILENT LAND  .........Joyce is involved well beyond her comfort zone.
stars Emma Fielding (Cranford), Aden Gillet (House of Elliot) & Danny Webb (Land Girls)

Midsomer Murders mixes humor, crime, and relationships, even ghosts in this set. Some say the best of good crime investigation. Midsomer Murders is an investment in my entertainment, and very watchable over and over. Used sets sell for almost as much as new. But I own them all, and I've not tried to sell even one. My wife would not let me if I wanted to. They even go down good at supper time.",1315872000,170,3017,4.99402390438247
4633074,4,B005A1GRO2,"Love this series, but one of the episodes, ""Blood on the Saddle,"" was the worst episode ever.",1497571200,,93,4.529411764705882
4633075,5,B005A1GRO2,"Midsomer Murders is going on 19 years, and Acorn TV has provided this new 19 th series. There are four episodes, and episode one will keep your attention, the episode named, The Village that Rose From The Dead, episode two is Crime and Punishment, Episode three is Last Man Out, episode four is Red in Tooth and Claw.

This series has everything you might want, murders, competition and a new DS. DCI Barnaby, played by Neil Dudgeon has another DS try out. DS Jamie Winter, played by Nick Hendrix, a young man bent on doing a good job. Baraby is a man who makes life a little difficult until the DS can prove himself. In the first episode, they are called to the sites of a murder, a young man has been partially run over by a tank. Yes, a tank. The little town of Auburn, has an old site that contained the miIitary during WWII. The pathologist, Kam, played by Manjinder Virk, a young woman with good experience, is called and she gives her thoughts. She also has a history with the new DS Hendrix.

From here on in, more murders, more characters, and more mayhem occur. The scripts follow the usual episodic trail, murder, detective work, and the culprit is found. Little green communities in the English countryside are featured. Midsomer continues to entertain.

We've just about finished this collection and look forward to settling into a mystery with detective Barnaby. It's nice to find a main character with a ""normal"", happy family life. The characters are a bit quirky. The plots are intricate and have a definite English twist to them, which makes it nice for something different from our American series (which we also enjoy). Very entertaining!
The only drawback is that every now and then we get a disk that sticks. I hate to miss any of the stories due to this. Still giving it 5 stars because we enjoy the series so much.",1411171200,,643,4.649122807017544

4633224,4,B005A1GRO2,"When actor John Nettles was first offered the starring role in MIDSOMER MURDERS, little did he know that the shows popularity and longevity would out-do his previous foray into the police show genre, Bergerac. (Bergerac, by the way, would be a most welcome addition to the Acorn Media library, hint hint). Bergerac lasted ten seasons, while MIDSOMER MURDERS with John Nettles as star, lasted from 1997 to 2011 (81 episodes). Its still in production, of course, with Neil Dudgeon as cousin John Barnaby now running the show.

And so here we are with SET 19 of our beloved MIDSOMERS, preparing to say goodbye to dear old Tom Barnaby as he contemplates retirement. Four more adventures, including the introduction of John Barnaby, comprise SET 19. More clever writing, outstanding supporting casts and high production values ensure there is life in the old show yet. It will take some time to adapt to Nettles being gone from the show, although we still have SET 20 coming up which will give us his final four mysteries, so the end isn't quite upon us yet. (There is something to be said for lagging behind the UK in terms of availability of episodesthey are already well into Neil Dudgeons tenure as the lead).

MIDSOMER MURDERS is unabashedly formulaic. It eschews the fast-paced, kinetic cutting of many more edgy police dramas. Its leisurely pacing suits the rural, even rustic locations in fictional Midsomer (a series of seemingly idyllic and innocent country villages). There is much to reinforce the traditional English village atmosphere with eccentrics in abundance, quirky county fairs and people of means versus the rest of us in a typical representation of the English class system.

Recently, the producer of MIDSOMER MURDERS, Brian True-May, got into trouble by explaining the lack of ethnic diversity on the show because of its emphasis on traditional, old-fashioned Britishness, by which he meant that there was a time when small English villages were entirely inhabited by white people. Some were offended by this comment and True-May was taken to task and is, apparently, stepping down as producer. Whether this will be the death knell for the series remains to be seen. Adjusting to John Nettles departure is already a shock. If, as John Nettles has said in interviews, the quality of MM is predominantly due to the fastidiousness of Brian True-Mays abilities as a producer, there may be trouble brewing. We shall see. All this to say, enjoy these wonderful programs while you can.

For this reviewer there is actually a more disturbing trend emanating from Midsomer, in fact from British productions in general, and that is an alarming anti-Christian prejudice that is as blatant as it is belligerent. In the case of MIDSOMER MURDERS, it has got to the point where if a person wears a clerical collar or professes to be one of the faithful, they are most certainly likely to be the murderer, or at least a nasty red herring! Apart from being predictable, this is a clear departure from the traditional Englishness that producer True-May cites as the reason for ethnic sameness on the show. Particularly evident of this trend to dismiss Christians as fanatics is the episode The Made-to-Measure Murders, one of the four featured episodes in Set 19. Even with an actor as outstanding as James Wilby guest-starring, this plot device has become a tired cliche. Of course one might argue that the central premise of MIDSOMER MURDERS is that under the layer of respectability is the very worst human behaviour, but when it means that people of faith (specifically Christianity) are evil by default, my patience runs thin.

However this is my only beef with an otherwise wonderful series. MIDSOMER MURDERS remains popular and in production for a reason. Its a great show. And hopefully Neil Dudgeon can fill the very big brown shoes of John Nettles.

Wisely, Jason Hughes (as Barnabys side-kick, DS Ben Jones) carries over into the new episodes. He has grown nicely into the role alongside Barnaby, even to the point of making it hard to remember Daniel Casey as Sgt Troy, way back when.

There is much to love here, even if there is cause for criticism. May Tom Barnaby enjoy a very happy, long and healthy retirement.",1397433600,,4230,4.940928270042194

The actors are classic actors, someone you'd likely pass on the street or village and think nothing of it.  I often wonder why the US market can't make series that are interesting, and without trying to start a trend, earrings, clothing and ways of life. The US Market wants to point out all the different life styles.  We need actors that act, not promote their way of life.

4633273,3,B005A1GRO2,"Having seen all of the segments from one to nineteen, I offer the following rules of the show:

1. Villains have at least a minor speaking part in the story, a person who is generally upbeat and positive.  Women are preferred as they are the least likely to be stabbing, pillaging, stalking, and beheading.

2. All Christians are intolerant, cruel, and nutty.  Priests are the worst.  (The writers have no understanding of the faith or of the Church of England. See ""The Sword of Guillaume"" in this set for an example of nasty ignorance.)

3. Joyce wins the ""worst dressed sane person"" award.

4. Marriages, outside the hero's, are terrible and almost always involve infidelity.

5. Groping, nudity, and simulated sex are standard after box 14 in hope of attracting the 15-year-old male audience that seems to control box offices everywhere on the planet.

6. At least one person in every show was someone else at some time in the past.

7. Barnaby has psychological powers that enable him to know facts at the end of a program that none of us were privy to.

8. The local medical examiner precedes the arrival of the detectives at murder scenes.  (One wonders how and why?)

9. Victims must be widely hated.

10. Villains wear black clothes and gloves. (One hopes they are waterproof.)

They don't have the NRA (Kill anyone anytime association). USA People claim a need for protection. Well yeah, there are easy to get  guns everywhere. Some claim a desire to hunt. You don't hunt with a hand gun, and if it takes more than two shots, you should not be hunting. And the (NRA) Kill Anyone Anytime Association says ""people not guns kIll""--leaving out the fact the people have easy access to guns, just about any type of guns because the NRA are the gun manufactures lead sales promoter.

4633386,1,B005A1GRO2,"Midsomer Murders is a wonderful series.  Unfortunately, even the best of series have blips in their road to status as classics.

This group of four episodes is deeply, profoundly, appallingly bad.  The Wild West episode, in which the members of the relevant society inexplicably canter around with Confederate flags (wrong time period, wrong geographical area, where are the fact checkers?), may hold pride of place as the worst episode of anything I have ever watched.  Of course, most of the time when something is clearly going to be terrible, I don't watch the rest of whatever it is, but in this case, and out of deference to my long acquaintance with this series, I stuck with it.  That's ninety minutes I won't get back.  It was at least memorable!

It has seemed to me with later sets of this series that the writers have relied to excess on homicidal mania for their plots.  This is a mistake.  As far as I can tell, the only significant weakness in the later sets is the writing--I still love Tom Barnaby, and I enjoy Joyce, although I would not want her for a friend as her friends seem to have VERY short life expectancies.  I would certainly NEVER let her join any organization of which I was a member, and if I saw her at any event I would run, not walk, to the nearest exit.

You get the idea.

With improvement to the plots, this series could easily resume its status as the wonderful vehicle for terrific acting that it already is.  In the meantime, I would recommend to the residents of Midsomer that they (1) stay out of graveyards, (2) stay away from churches of any kind, (3) avoid Joyce Barnaby at any cost, and (4) never go out at night, ever, with an emphasis on never going into any wooded area (either night or day).  And if you hear an owl, run.",1340064000,18,1772,4.462732919254658

The episode with an pseudo-American Old West theme is ludicrous and must have been written and produced on some ""high.""

The U.K. boasts so many fine, often underrated actors. The intrepid Jason Hughes is a wonderful foil as Detective Sergeant Ben Jones, with his wry humor adding another level of complexity to the series. John Nettles is irascible as Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby, perfectly represented by the Badger emblem on Midsomer's police cars. Sharp dialogue makes this collection a real treat. This isn't lace doily stuff! We even love the weird and unique music. The Brits have knack for mixing classic stories with ghoulish humor and sharp observations of the flawed human character. Historically, penny-dreadfuls were published at Christmastime, as in Robert Louis Stevenson and Charles Dickens. This series is a virtual escape to the dangerous environs of Midsomer county. We're happy to fall through the cracks of normal reality, into the dangerous, but beautiful, environs of Midsomer, whose denizens inflict numerous creative malaises. The cleverness of the series is addictive. This collection features the following four mysteries:

The Made-to-Measure Murders: Milton Cross is almost entirely owned by one church-going landlord. We know by now that churches don't promise refuge in Midsomer; a widow is stabbed to death before a thwarted confession. Then, Barnaby and Jones discover new information her unfortunate husband's death two years before. Of course, one murder leads to another in the sinister but beautiful landscape of Midsomer. Barnaby steals a fine tweed from under his poor wife's neglected nose.

The Sword of Guillaume: Happy to visit his cousin DCI John Barnaby (the excellent Neil Dudgeon), and eat food away from his wife Joyce's abominable cooking, Barnaby visits Brighton with the Causton Chamber of Commerce. But heads will roll when Causton meets Brighton, the Midsomer bloodstain will spread its deathly affects. There is no rest for our Barnaby, as he becomes embroiled in a case rife with dubious real-estate deals, ancient family history, and missing swords. He enlists the help of his Barnaby cousin, who is gifted with the same powers of keen observation and memory. Midsomer County is oddly rife with uncanny resemblances. Recall that a similar-looking man was a gifted gardener in an early Midsomer mystery. Likely, DCI John Barnaby is also good with plants.

Blood on the Saddle: A Wild West Show through the macabre lens of Midsomer. The plot is the weakest in this fine collection, with the wrong bullets for the right guns; I've seen the real thing in the West. The mystery simply doesn't work, too many loose-ends. While working in the dunk-tank, a woman is shot and killed, other improbable murders follow. Confederate flags (not the same as Wild West) oddly decorate the show. A disliked farmer's land is involved in a dispute over a patch called ""The Swamp, whose value is never explained. Beware swamps and Wild West shows. Barnaby and the wryly clever Jones (Jason Hughes) deal with Romany (another loose thread, not followed-up with).

The Silent Land: An excellent mystery, one of the best in the series. Poor Joyce Barnaby (the excellent Jane Wymark, whose name isn't even credited on the collection's DVD box), when she isn't cooking some unpalatable reduction of root veg and suspect fowl, she's out driving, looking for more ingredients for concoctions to gently inflict on husband DCI Tom Barnaby. This mystery features the untimely demise of a March Magna librarian (no professions are safe), whom Joyce believes she hit with her car, driving the wonderful Cully (Laura Howard, a fine actress indeed) home after a folk concert. The unfortunate librarian was fixated by a grave the local cemetery. The town features a crumbling hospital with a sad history, and an amorous ghost-tour guide. Ghosts add to the mystery. Enjoy!",1332201600,3,4226,5.476993865030675
4633411,3,B005A1GRO2,"I have all 19 Season DVDs.  I love this show.  However, the Season 19 is not as good as the previous ones.

First, all murders are very brutal and bloody.  Who wants to see the decapitated bloody bodies?  Secondly, the plots (all four) do not have much logic.  The motivation for murdering people here does not have much sense.  Why did someone murder people just because his wife can't be buried in the local cemetery?  Why did someone decapitate several people just because she wanted to marry a mentally disabled descendant of William the Conqueror? Why did a landlord have to kill people just because he has fairs with the tenants? Why did an English professional obey the American Western's rule of duel?  Even murderer should have some sense.

I have series 20 on pre-order so I will then have all the John Nettles MSM shows on DVD.

I'll keep buying them as fast as they can print them.  Just keep them coming!,1328572800,,404,4.276315789473684
4633454,5,B005A1GRO2,"The whole series is as comforting as an old sweater on a cold winter evening in front of the fire. Midsomer's population is now one tenth of what is was before this series began...there have been so many murders that I think even Tom Barnaby and all three of his sergeants in the series have counted. This series brings to light the quality of British television and if anyone ever tries to say the US has a Monopoly on good television...take an evening and watch Midsomer Murders The light hearted dry humor, the clues along the way, and the banter between Tom, his wife and daughter (now married and gone away), George the long-time forensics expert (through out the entire series), and some of the usual suspects are bright spots in the story-telling. The beacon and the foundation is Tom Barnaby, a tough-as-nails CI (Chief Investigator), with a soft center like a good chocolate. The gruesome (no splatter) murders, and the way the story unravels the clues in front of your eyes without giving away the, often, surprising ending will constantly entertain you, and keep you wishing that you might consider yourself lucky to have become a fan of this long-standing top shelf drama. It just doesn't get any better than this program for a Who-Done-It. The countryside vistas will remind you of All Creatures Great and Small (with Robert Hardy), and the quaint little English villages make you wish you could buy a ticket to spend your next Bank Holiday traveling to all corners of the County of Midsomer. The churches alone, highlighted in many episodes are simple and magnificent to the eye. This program is candy for the brain, and easy on the eye, and a joy to relax with on any afternoon or evening. Enjoy and behold the Spot-On pleasure of a top-quality program, great acting (you sometimes can't tell if John Nettles is acting at all!), and another body on the moor to keep the team jumping and you guessing.",1325030400,22,1915,4.736526946107785
4633455,3,B005A1GRO2,"I've been watching the series for a while now, the bests parts are: good acting and scrumptious English country settings. However you must suspend reality to believe that the British countryside has a murder rate 100 times per cap.  higher than New Orleans or Detroit!  The often grizzly murders move the plot,  you can count on 3 to 4 death per episode. And here lies the rub, in order to explain why the  the sedate conservative residents become killers the writer  builds up reasondat based on shaky foundations. There is just not enough motivation  for most of the characters to commit the ultimate sin.  On the other hand there are tons of red herrings and plot twists to bamboozle even the hard core mystery buffs.  In the end, while you may get entertained you may not necessarily get nourished.",1324857600,4,802,4.719424460431655
4633456,5,B005A1GRO2,"I have heard about this series.  I enjoy British detective films.  Judging by these selected episodes, this series is really very special.  I intend to watch more from the series.",1324166400,2,179,4.9
4633457,5,B005A1GRO2,"When I was in England a few years ago, an English couple introduced me to Midsomer Murders. Since 2006, I have become a fan of the series and I loved every episode. I've been renting the episodes through Netflix but I am hoping to start purchasing them soon to add to my crime/mystery collection.",1323388800,3,296,4.5
4633458,3,B005A1GRO2,"This is definitely an enjoyable series with great writing and good performances. However, I'd like to point out a few things on the down side; 1- the murders are extremely grizzly with lots of blood and mutilated corpses at every episode, which is in sharp contrast to the supposedly peaceful villages where they occurred. 2 - The motives that caused the villagers to murder are very trivial and petty most of the time. 3 - The murderers are the most unlikely people; people who have lived clean and decent lives in a nice peaceful village suddenly go berserk for some petty reason and start butchering their neighbors.
 So obviously the writers achieve their goal - it's just about impossible to guess who done it, but it made me feel let down in the end of every episode.
Anyway, like I said - it is an enjoyable show never the less, just take off your thinking cap and enjoy the blood fest...",1323216000,6,895,4.559006211180124
4633459,3,B005A1GRO2,"I purchased the first 3 volumes of Midsomer Murders several years ago,and they were not captioned.  Some $154.00 worth.  I too need closed captioning, but if the subtitles, or closed captioning is not specifically stated as a yes, then I will not purchase.  These were from Alcorn as well.",1322784000,2,289,4.857142857142857
4633460,5,B005A1GRO2,"This series is one more session of murder by the dozens and great solutions.  I am not sure why there is any one left in these Midsommer Villages, as most have died off. These are super entertaining from the mystery side and the inter-play between the characters.  Barnaby continues to be old-school solving the mysteries the old-fashioned way (he is something like Jack Frost without complete bending of the rules and disregard for authority.)  He is the only major detective who does not have a destructive home life as he has almost normal family relationships.  He constantly stands up his wife when something suddenly gives him inspriation.  Unfortunately, his daughter finally married and moved on.  The mother and daughter frequently were instrumental in solving cases. Our only regret is that he is retiring, but in the meantime enjoy an excellent show filmed in some wonder countryside scenery and looks under the surface including the bed.",1322265600,5,949,5.090322580645161
4633461,5,B005A1GRO2,"I have collected this series from set 9 through  set 18 and love them all.  The scenery is beautiful and the plot for each keeps you guessing until the end.  In many British movies it can be difficult to understand the wording due to the actor/actress's accent; however, with these, I have no problem.  I definitely would recommend these if you love mysteries!  Set 19 is available for pre-order!!",1319500800,10,397,4.695652173913044
4633462,5,B005A1GRO2,"I was introduced to Midsomer Murders recently.  I bought Set 17 and Set 18 at a steal on Amazon.  I really enjoyed all the episodes on both sets.  I think the show is just simply incredible.  It's so slow moving but before you know it the show's over.

I do have a question for all the diehard Midsomer Murders fans out there.  Would anybody know if the other sets have subtitles?  I would like to buy the other sets but only if there are subtitles.  The British English is kind of difficult for me to understand.

Anyway, I'm now a big fan of Midsomer Murders and I highly recommend this show to all Agatha Christie fans.  Thank you very much.",1318723200,35,644,4.291666666666667
4633463,5,B005A1GRO2,"John Nettles is perfect in this role. His common sense and ability to sift through clues, blatant and obscure, is fascinating to watch. BBC knows how to develop mysteries.",1318291200,10,171,4.931034482758621

8463172,3,B005A1GRO2,"Only FOUR Episodes here! There is a huge difference between ""seasons"" and ""Sets."" The sets contain but four episode, expensive to watch, while the seasons contain about ten or more. The settings are just great: one gets to see Geo. Fourth's lavish castle in Brighton, and ride on a lovely tour bus...the atmosphere here, as well as the droll wit of John Nettle's delivery of Barnaby, are great entertainment, but, really! just foir discs?? Highly disappointing, when the sets contain so many more for the same price! Still, the trip to Brighton was worth it...The last disc was ind of terrible, though...the outlandish bad dream quality of The Old American West as imagined by an over-tired British writer really is just poorly done, and without the scenery to back up such a terrible plotline. Best to look for Episode titles and their seasons and get a larger collection of episodes for one's money!!!",1522108800,,903,4.908496732026144
