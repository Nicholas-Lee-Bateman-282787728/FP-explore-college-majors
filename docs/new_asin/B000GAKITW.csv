8130069,5,B000GAKITW,"Fun, amusing Spanish-language, Mexican-made mystery-comedy.  A group of people inherit an eccentric's fortune but to get it they must spend three nights in the old mansion searching for the bulk of the loot.  By day they can go back to their lives, but they must be back to the estate by midnight to qualify for the inheritance.  A detective, played by Clavillazo, is hired to help protect the two young lovers who are the principal beneficiaries.  He, as a comedian, is definitely an acquired taste.  The film also has scenes in a nightclub called El Infierno (Hell).  The servers dress as devils.  Some theme.  Some of the musical numbers are great.  I bought the Vina Distributor DVD release.  It has no subtitles but the quality is very good.  Highly recommended.",1399161600,,767,4.823076923076923
8130070,4,B000GAKITW,"This creepy Mansion comedies are a dime a dozen. Everybody has one in their credits. Tin Tan, Pompn Iglesias, etc. Here the star is Clavillazo.
The plot changes though, because the group of people who were called to get the inheritance, will not have to spend 3 days and 3 nights in the creepy Mansion before they die or go crazy; they can go home and live their lives as they usually do and only visit the Mansion by night. They have to endure 3 nights here, and if they survive, the money is theirs to keep.
Most of that money will go to one niece of the deceased, Mercedes Benz (Alma Rosa Aguirre) while the rest will go to whoever finds it, because it's hidden.
So, every night, the doctor, the lawyer, the girlfriend, the maid, the chauffeur, they all will try to outsmart the rest in a crazy race until the executioner shows up and start leaving less and less people to enjoy wealth.
Is then when Mercedez Benz's boyfriend hires a private detective (Clavillazo) to find the hidden money fast and stop the killings.
Very good comedy with hand made characters perfectly well designed and cast. There's nothing creepier than the maid (Enriqueta Reza), o Manuel Dond, or Jos Chvez Throwe...",1316649600,,1192,4.574766355140187
