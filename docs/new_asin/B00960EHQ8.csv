8536417,2,B00960EHQ8,"Eric (Eddie Guerra), Stu (Donald Faison) and Alex (Eddie Kaye Thomas) play three likeable second story men. Eric is in love with Tara (Jaime Pressly) who has left him for someone else. Stu is thinking about marrying his girlfriend (Roselyn Sanchez) who doesn't know is pregnant. Alex bets on horses and lives at home with his oversexed grandmother (Florence Henderson).

The guys get phone calls at inopportune moments. They eventually rob a crime boss and things don't go as planned.

The film has all the makings of a good comedy, but failed to deliver. The jokes and comedy were mostly stale. Second tier rental at best.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex. Male rear nudity. G-string nudity.",1373155200,,688,4.965217391304348
