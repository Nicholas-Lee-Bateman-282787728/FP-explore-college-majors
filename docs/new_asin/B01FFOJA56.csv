7749851,5,B01FFOJA56,"Personally I'm not a fan of watching 3 hours straight of Suits like my husband is. I can only stand one episode a night. So when I saw the chance to get all of suits episodes, I knew it would be the perfect gift for my husband who was heartbroken that the show ended.

Now he watches it when he's not playing his new video game. A bonus for me since I can have some me time and soak in the bath while he watches 2 to 3 hours of Suits.",1488758400,,434,3.769230769230769
7749852,2,B01FFOJA56,"What started out as a promising courtroom drama has deteriorated into a repetitive soap opera. This fantasy law firm in New York (where else)that is populated by only beautiful and brilliant lawyers and para-legals. Every story is nearly the same, the impossible case, the rogue lawyer going against his boss'es orders, the client keeping vital secrets, and then the hero (Harvey Specter) saving the day with a legal precedent (or other last minute legal wrangling) that only he (or his brilliant associate) are aware of. This show suffers from the same delusional self importance that made Mad Men un-watchable. At this point (I am up to season three) there is virtually NO courtroom drama only lawyers blathering on and on about . . .  well, themselves and the multitude of on-again off-again relationships and employments and ownership and....hell, I can't keep up, I am surprised ANYONE has time to practice any.... what's it called....LAW. Trust me when I say that there is no drama, no brilliance and little or no humor or humanity in this show. Dull and lifeless sums it up. I will say that this is well suited for a daytime drama however.",1487808000,,1146,4.876923076923077

8760709,1,B01FFOJA56,"I should have been careful about the REGION CODE, and it didn't work in my DVD player. This product should include region code information in the title or something with high profile. This is America, you know. I wanted to return it, but I found out that the shipping fee would be more expensive than actual price of this DVD, because this DVD requires international shipping.",1527638400,,376,4.712121212121212
