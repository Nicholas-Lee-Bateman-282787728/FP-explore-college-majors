7002534,5,B00T73AP2Y,"This movie is adorable. It's very well paced with a great story. Maya is a bee that doesn't know where she fits in with the hive, so she ventures out into the nearby meadow and discovers new insect friends, adventure, intrigue, and a devious plot against the Queen Bee. Adults and children alike will enjoy this highly entertaining film. I only wish it had been in theatres.",1432252800,,374,4.597014925373134
7002535,5,B00T73AP2Y,The story of Maya the Bee has been around for decades. This fun and family friendly movie is a nice way to introduce to my young ones. Nice upgraded story. My kids are glued to this.  They are fascinated by Maya and Willy. Highly recommend to buy this. Greatest way to occupy kids.,1431993600,,281,4.30188679245283
7002536,5,B00T73AP2Y,"Maya the Bee Movie is a cute and funny movie! Its about a young little bee named Maya who is very curious and eager to learn about the beehive. As Maya explores the beehive without permission, she asks a bunch of questions. Maya quickly learns that she is completely different from the other bees. She repeatedly finds herself in trouble by Buzzlena, the queens assistant. As a result, Maya gets banned from the hive. Her friend Willie does not want Maya to be alone, so he leaves the hive and follows her. As Maya and Willie are out in the meadows, they learn that hornets and the other bugs and insects are not as bad as they have been told. While Maya has been banned from the beehive because of her curiosity, Buzzleana devises a plan to harm the Queen so that she can take control of the bees and the hive.
There are several different messages in this movie. The one that stands out the most to me is, dare to be different. In this movie, the bees have to follow specific rules, specific directions and they must do as they are told. Maya is different and she is told that she does not belong in the beehive. She works hard to find her place among the bees. She learns that she is an important bee in the kingdom and that her voice is important.

My favorite part is when Willie is mad at Maya and decides to fly back to the beehive. Willie is scared of everything. But, when a frog sticks out his tongue to try to capture Willie for dinner, Willie hits the frogs tongue and flies away without looking back. Thats pretty impressive for a fearful bee.

My favorite character is Willie. Willie is a very loyal and a true friend. He supports Maya and helps her when shes down and hes not afraid to tell her when shes not right. Willie is also very funny.

Maya and the Bee Movie is a wonderful movie! It has great messages for kids! I recommend this movie for boys and girls ages 5 to 10. I give this movie 3 out of 5 shinning stars!

7002537,5,B00T73AP2Y,"Maya emerges from her little cubicle eager for life and very curious. She is not the typical bee. It seems the only other insects that appreciate her are her young bee friend, a violin playing grasshopper and a hornet, named Sting.

Maya wants to know where she can fly to encounter adventure and danger. With the help of other insects, Maya saves the queen by locating the missing Royal Jelly and the bees and the hornets become friends.

This movie is a wonderful family movie. There are so many good values to learn. Characters are caught in dishonesty and must pay the consequences of their actions. Truth prevails in many of the movie situations. Perseverance and the courage to follow your heart help Maya to continue her quest to save the queen.

I believe your family will enjoy seeing the movie and you will probably want to watch it more than once.

The movie was cute, however, the characters have English accents. I thought the movie was the American version so it did throw him off a bit.

It shows that some cannot be trusted but things work out when the truth comes and there is a happy ending.

The film has a very Disney like feel to it as it deals with Maya, a new born bee trying to figure out her place her the world while the royal advice giver (like Jafar in Aladdin)  tries to take over the crown.

7002618,5,B00T73AP2Y,"Before seeing this movie, I had never heard of ""Maya the Bee."" This was somewhat surprising to me, as I consider myself a follower of animation, but perhaps it's not so surprising when you consider the limited availability of ""Maya the Bee"" in the United States. When I first saw the DVD at the library, I thought maybe it was another ""mockbuster""-type film, something like ""Plan Bee."" Rarely have I been more glad to be wrong.

After doing a bit of research, I decided to take a chance on ""Maya the Bee Movie"" and was absolutely delighted. From the beginning, I was enchanted by Maya, a cute, young bright spirit of a bee who possesses a genuine sense of wonder, spirit and fun. The movie has a very strong opening, with Maya exploring the world for the first time, and us discovering the meadow in which the bees live along with her. After this, the movie settles down into the meat of the story about how Maya and a group of unlikely friends must save their bee community from a plot that would place them at war with a rival colony of hornets. There are many good messages in the movie, a couple of fun songs, and animation that, while maybe not on the level of some of today's top-level films I nevertheless found quite pleasing to watch. I also liked the voice casting - this film eschews the use of a celebrity voice cast, or even big names in animation, but I thought all of the voices worked well and Maya's in particular I though was well-suited for her character and enhanced my enjoyment of the film.

I read a review that dismissed the film as simply being the sort of feel-good film that adults feel that kids want, but I don't think this is true. There's a place for many types of films, and I would hate to think that there is no place for a film like this one. Easy to like, with good messages and a nice cast characters, I certainly recommend it.",1436140800,,1864,4.368876080691643

7002626,4,B00T73AP2Y,"Its too easy to simply dismiss a feature like this with an offhand, Well, the kids seemed to like it, but I read a book. That may be completely true, as Maya the Bee Movie is virtually free of deconstructive humor, ironic asides and sideways glances at the grownups. This is not Jerry Seinfelds Bee Movie.

It doesnt try to be. Maya is in the category of the Tinker Bell movies, with a feisty, independent youngster who questions the unquestioned and bucks the system, much to the disgust of the Jafar-like Miss Buzzinaa bigoted bee with her eyes on the queens crown. Somehow she sees Mayas innocent antics and guileless honesty a threat, so she wastes no time banishing the tot from the hive. Maya and her best friend bee, Willie, find adventure in the Meadowlands, where dangers threaten.

The cheery proceedings stay consistent throughout, with nary a dark spot. When the supposed monster Gorgo is described, the film gets a teeny bit moody for a few seconds. The gags and language of the film stay away from naughty words and poop jokes with only a few exceptions: on bee says Full of and another bee quiets him with a Shhhh! And a dung beetle provides a chunk of foul smelling frolic.

However, the film is by and large a slam dunk for 3 to 5 year olds with their parents and caregivers. Every adventure is more fun than hazardous. Maya rarely lets any creature intimidate her. The setting is all done in primary colors as flowers galore appear in every direction. Its a pretty movie, and while one might assume its just for girls, Maya has several male friends of equal virtue and spunk.

The background score is quite pleasant, matching up nicely with the colorful vistas. There are only two songs; one that Flip the Grasshopper sings at the ball, and a pop tune over the credits. Thats odd because this is such a song-type film, but maybe the absence of cute songs is a way of de-cutiefying the proceedings. The British accents also help take out a little adorability and add more gravitas (if that word can even be applied to this film).

9-year-old Coco Jack Gilles brings a sincere, non-cloying tone to the voice of Maya. Her character is sort of like Boo from Monsters, Inc. if she were a few years older. Best friend Willie resembles UPAs Gerald McBoing-Boing a bit.

The Blu-ray/DVD extras are sparse, mostly repurposed promo spots and interstitials. This is becoming common on home video, likely due to the ever increasing expenses and the ever diminishing returns.

If Maya the Bee seems vaguely familiar, its because the character has been around a very long time  over 100 years, in fact. Lots of adaptations have buzzed around, including an anime version widely seen on Nickelodeon some decades back. This film was based on a series as well.

Maya the Bee was originally a German fairytale that dates back to 1912.  Since then it has been published into other languages, has become a TV show, and now it's getting the Hollywood treatment.  While the movie is a bit different than the book, much of the story remains the same.
Maya is born into an unstable beehive.  The aging queen is seen as ""too soft"" by her advisor and she schemes to replace her.  Meanwhile Maya is having trouble trying to find her role in the bee community.  Nobody seems to be as carefree as her and she seems to cause more trouble than is useful.

After exploring the Meadows without permission from her teacher, she befriends a grasshopper and other insects.  It's here that the story borrows a bit from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.  Wasps and bees are hostile towards each other and any reason will suffice for starting a war with the opposing side.  Young bees and wasps are instructed not to communicate with other insects, but especially not bees or wasps.

Naturally, Maya and her best friend, Willy, meet a young wasp and save his life from a spider.  To save face from his angry father, he confesses that they saved his life, but denies his friendship with them.  They meet up later in the movie and he apologizes for that.

Later on in the movie a war is brewing between the wasps and the bees and they plan on attacking each others' homes.  The young friends unite despite their differences and rally insects from all over the meadow to stop the unnecessary violence.

I don't want to give away the causes or the outcome of this battle as you should see this movie for yourself and benefit from the silly humor within.  My three kids enjoyed and laughed throughout the story.  There is some potty humor with the dung beetle rolling around what he's known for.  Maya is brave, charming, and loveable; my kids are looking forward to watching more of her adventures.",1432512000,,1970,4.593123209169055

I love the movie but, not happy with the voice of Maya; she doesn't have that softness, Max sounds like a goof, and not the caring Max etc. My grandson likes it anyway so far! We originally saw Maya The Bee on YouTube by ""Kukimao"" in 2018 and the voices are great and once you see the ones on YouTube, you just love those voices!",1527552000,,412,4.1625
