2056105,4,B0002235LC,"I just wanted to point out that sticking Doug Emerson's head on Luke Perry's body on the cover photo is weird and stupid. (Luke Perry doesn't show up until the first regular episode of the series.) Why not just use a different photo? The photo used is from a season two promo shoot anyway (when Doug Emerson was no longer in the cast). It's kind of an insult to think we won't notice that the photo has been doctored. Dumb.

Otherwise, I'd recommend this pilot movie. The show had so much potential at this point. They even attempt to give the teachers some screen time and Kelly and Donna have multicultural friends in their clique -- to name a couple of the elements the pilot has that the series lacked.",1144713600,,706,4.430769230769231
2056106,5,B0002235LC,"I agree with those who wrote before that we need to have the series (one of the best in my opinion) out on DVD already. The Pilot DVD is great and fun to watch. A good buy.  I remember staying home to watch the show and I planned my schedule for the next 10 years around the show.  I was addicted to say the least.

The latest that I heard was that since the series used alot of popular, top 40 songs, they are having to get permission from each artists before the DVDs can be released. Don't know how much weight there is in this, but it's the latest info I could find.",1144108800,,570,3.982456140350877
2056107,1,B0002235LC,"Just like the OC, rich kids r portrayed as having many many & many problems. I was in my teens when the series aired. Even when i was a teen, I thought to myself, ""this is the stupidest show ever and so unrealistic."" Every show portrayed the actors has having problems after problems. Examples : my mother whose a famous fashiion designer is a crackhead, my friend played w/ a gun and accidentally shot himself dead (this was the stupidest episode by far), my friend died during a drive by at UCLA, i'm a teen and i have breast cancer, i'm a drunk, i'm a drug user, we moved to 90210 but my mom is a housewife, my father forces me to work even though i'm rich and i live in Beverly Hills. Whoever wrote the series doesn't know anything. Yeah, a mother whose a housewife in Beverly Hills. I remember a show where the group went to a underground rave and they didn't even play the right music for a rave scene. Stupid. S-T-U-P-I-D.",1140134400,,929,4.314285714285714

All through the 90's, this show was the one thing that I looked forward to every week... even the reruns!!! I rearranged my schedule and even broke dates to watch my favorite show. I am BEGGING AARON SPELLING to PLEASE put out Beverly Hills 90210 on DVD Set. I will buy each and every one of the sets, and even buy them for my friends as gifts!!!

2056110,1,B0002235LC,"Superficial, trite...just an all around bummer. Who cares about Beverly Hills? Who would ever buy into the ridiculous dialouge that is the supposed ""voice"" of this show about nothing? What a mess! What an afront to young people living during this awful time! For anyone even remotely interested in the 90's, lemme tell ya...they sucked completely. Fashion was asinine and except for a few small pockets of music, that  sucked as well. Everything ""hip"" and ""cool"" was being bought up by big business who were running over themselves to cash in on ""youth culture"" at a sickening and alarming rate. It was a horrorfying time to be alive, only to be outdone by the oughts (00's). Pathetic, cruel, and no redeeming value whatsoever. Buy something like ""Alice's Restaurant"" instead. At least then you'll get something genuine and meaningful.",1135987200,,835,5.050724637681159

I guarantee that every girl that made your show sucessful back in the 90's will be lining up to buy the DVD's (especially the ""Brenda Years"" seasons).

Sigh I loved Beverly Hills 90210 my kids loved it, I still love the re runs but tv here only ever shows segmented series and we want it all.  This box set would fly off the shelves in the UK, come on Amazon how do we all get together and contact the makers to petition them to put this on DVD.  Anyone knowing how we can start one up please contact me I'd love to be in on the petition.  Thanks.",1128038400,,595,3.782258064516129

We grew up watching this show and idolizing the characters!!! It's our childhood!!! Alf, Golden Girls, Knight Rider, Saved By The Bell have all been released already onto DVD which is great but we need 90210!!!!!!!!! IT WILL SELL WELL THAT is a given!!

2056115,5,B0002235LC,"It's been 15 years since the pilot aired. If Aaron Spelling has been waiting for a momentus time to release even Season One of ""9-0"" isn't this it? I'm tired of watching my sketchy VHS tapes with missing episodes. I religiously taped every one I could when it was in syndication, but just when I'd get grooving F/X would suddenly change seasons on me. I long for rare goodies like Season 4's ""Flashback"" episode where Brenda finds the old diary from the 60's in the window seat in her room and they do that whole ""Bobby Kennedy, Woodstock"" thing, and prove to us that the Brenda/Dylan/Kelly love triangle transcends all space and time.

  Overall, 9-0 is one of my all time favorite shows (like you couldn't tell). I used to schedule my classes around Wed. nite so I wouldn't miss it. Granted, it had its lean episodes (Sophie? I loved Laura Leighton in Melrose Place but her part didn't work in S9 of 9-0), but you can't deny the appeal & the impact it has had on future shows. How many similarities btwn 9-0 and The OC can you count? Let's forget the obvious rich kids in So. CA in High School (duh) and go for details: Newcomer(s) come into town and everything changes for the longtime residents; Season 1 had a fashion show where ppl got wasted; there is need for a venue where fresh new musical acts can be showcased (PPAD & The Bait Shop); Peach Pit = Crab Shack for comfort food hangout.

  You can also pick up on some very ""9-0"" manorisms while you watch The OC. But that's not why we're here...is it. There are those little things that make each season special and unique, and to a true fan, finding the quirks in each can be a thrill. One that stands out in my mind is how for years we have actual film documentation that Donna has eaten and loves chocolate. Yet suddenly in Season 9 when Gina gets Donna a chocolate cake for her B-Day, Noah goes off on her for not knowing that Donna is allergic to chocolate. WHAT?! They've also cast the same actors in different roles over the years (can you guess who and when?). If only they'd had one of us insane-o fans on staff these things could have been better thought out. But then it wouldn't be so much fun to find them out and laugh about them!

  By the way, if you ever had a general question about an episode, there is a GREAT database website: [...] that among zillions of other shows lists descriptions for all 297 episodes of this wonderous decade-long program. Aaron Spelling...do you hear my cries? Give us 9-0 on DVD! Thank you",1120435200,,2495,4.406521739130435
2056116,5,B0002235LC,"I grew up watching BH90210 in Canada and never missed an episode. I love the show & would definitely buy the complete boxed sets! I hope the producers will be able to come to their senses that BH90210 still has a loyal following. sigh, I would give my right arm to re-experience the Kelly-Dylan-Brenda love triangle, Dylan losing his wife (rebecca Gayheart) in a car explosion and the exceptionally written 100th episode special, directed by Jason Priestly (or was it Jennie Garth) & many more memorable moments from the show.

2056117,5,B0002235LC,I think it's stupid to release the pilot episode alone.  I think that each season of 90210 should be released.  It is so much more deserving that most of the other releases out there.,1114473600,,183,4.352941176470588

2056131,5,B0002235LC,"This pilot episode is a must for a fashion retrospective (Shannen Doherty is pale even for a character who was transplanted from Minnesota!)...but do not spend any time looking for Luke Perry. When this series first aired he was not part of the cast.
Perry had originally read for the part of Steve Sanders (which was eventually given to Ian Ziering)and failed to recieve that part. Casting was however impresed enough to create the role of Dylan McKay and call Perry back for the first complete season. Thank goodness for second chances because I ultimately believe that Perry/Dylan McKay provided the all-critical drama/humor balance critical to drawing mass audiences during the first years of this series.
Nitpicking aside,because the pilot is frequently unaired in favor of the seasons which initially made the show a household name, purchasing this DVD is good for retrospective sakes. Giving viewers a general idea of what the series will be about...although there is markedly less soap than contained in future seasons (especially the 'college' and 'adult' years of the same series)...the pilot is important for any 90210 fan.
I also agree buying this particular DVD would place pressure on the network to eventually release all the seasons. I find it frustrating that so many 'flash in the pan' teen series are being released at a faster rate than the milestone show which started everything.",1085788800,,1401,5.122270742358078

Anyway, I enjoyed the pilot episode of Beverly Hills 90210, and it does bring back good memories. And also, it's the beginning of everything. For a strange moment, I kept thinking that the show would start in Minneapolis first, but that never did happen. Catching the perpetrator who wrecked his vette, why would Steve Sanders offer 50 bucks as a reward? That's way too low, and he could have offered more for faster results. The lawyer Jason did the right thing because the key word is ""statutory rape."" had Brenda let the lie go on too long, Jason would have been disbarred, sent to prison, and lost everything that he worked for. So, he had the right to feel the way he did. Brandon's punishment was totally uncalled for, and it was a pretty much of a poor reaction to a small slip of his tongue. However, Brandon should be lucky in this situation because he gets to find out what kind of a girl Marianne is like: a spoiled person without limits. The fashion of West Beverly High is interesting because it looked so bad for people who have boatload of money. I expected more, but that's all right...it's still the 80s. Brian Austin Green, making his debut in the pilot episode, will show a very remarkable transformation in the later episodes. On the other hand, the DVD works just fine, it's exactly as I expected, and it's very bare bones.",1277078400,,1494,4.557620817843866
