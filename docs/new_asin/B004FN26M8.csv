8427992,2,B004FN26M8,"I bought this thinking they would cover more about bats than they did.  I needed it to show little kids, and I'm glad I screened it first.

It is very out of date information, and only a segment covers bats.  Concerning the bat segment, the video serves more as an artifact of trying to break wildlife to man's will rather than studying natural phenomena for inherent benefit.  The case study about vampire bats has the scientists smearing anticoagulant and the vampire bats to destroy their roost.  They never filmed or showed what must have become a gooey puddle of bat remains.

I found it dissappointing and useless for the kids.",1388275200,2,633,4.709090909090909
