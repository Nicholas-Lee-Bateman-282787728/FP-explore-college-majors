Saint Seiya is really a childrenhood serie, trading tapes with friends, getting the figurines...It was real success in the 90's (series started in 1980) specially in Europe; France and Spain. I watched the US version and I don't think they would start it back again. The translation is not that good, and there is some censor in the anime. The serie really get interesting in the sanctuary chapter, and they did not even get there.

For anyone who would like to enjoy some good japanimation, get Saint Seiya (Chevaliers du Zodiaque - Caballeros del Zodiaco)...Sanctuary chapter, huum Asgard Chapter would be the next one to get, and you can just download the Hades Chapter -The drawings are crazy on that one-

8051145,5,B0007SL2O8,I think Saint Seiya is really good entertainment. Highly addictive. I'm wondering when the rest of the series is going to be released. I hope they release it soon.,1128124800,,163,4.655172413793103
8051146,5,B0007SL2O8,"This is to me, the best anime series ever made, I don't know why here in the US is not popular but in the rest of the world it is. This dvd is very good but the problem is that AVN did not continue to do saint seiya, that sucks, AVN stopped at episode 60 when this series has 127 episodes.",1126224000,2,289,3.7540983606557377
