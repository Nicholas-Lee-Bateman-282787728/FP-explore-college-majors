4647303,5,B005BUA1H6,"I picked this up at Wal-Mart without even looking at the price- but it was about $20, so good price. The DVD quality is pretty decent, a simple layout- Season 2 on disc 1 & 2, and Season 3 on disc 3 & 4 with some special features. The vintage doc about how the show is made is interesting but horrible quality and ultimately the special feature with the interviews with the two main writers was awesome! This was by far my favorite animated show from the late-1990's, I mean for the time the Animation was top-notch and it even looks better that the current Transformers Prime show thats on TV now. The voice acting is some of the best ever, and the story-lines (especially in seasons 2&3) are nothing short of spectacular! Overall this has been my best DVD purchase of the year. If you haven't seen the first season I would definitely start there, because the series is built on season-long story arcs and these two seasons together are about as many episodes as the just the first season. But these seasons are by far the best story-wise and visually, especially the character designs! If all Transformers properties were done this well then the franchise would be on the same par as Star Wars or Star Trek. Love It!",1320192000,2,1218,4.515837104072398
4647304,1,B005BUA1H6,"I am not penalizing this DVD set in any shape or form, because I am sure that it is good, but I already have it thanks to ordering the complete series from shoutfactory.com.  So be warned, if you get this set only, you've wasted money by not buying the complete series which will have this in the box.  That is all",1319760000,,314,4.131147540983607
4647305,5,B005BUA1H6,"This was the greatest cartoon series ever, but it was hardly done justice as HD tv's were just coming out when it premiered. Now that LED HD is the standard, its great to have this series in high-quality DVD. It brings back great memories of me and my now 16 year old son watching the show. And my currently 9 year old is interested in it as well. Beast Wars was a childrens series that kept adults entertained as well with characters you could connect with and well thought out episodes. And now that you can view it the way it was meant to be seen, its even better. Maybe they will bring it back.",1319587200,,598,4.208695652173913
4647306,5,B005BUA1H6,"In the thrilling conclusion to the Beast Wars Transformers series, a new war has broken out between the Transformers. Optimus Primal and the Maximals must stop Megatron and his Predacons from obtaining Energon that's needed to fuel their campaign to conquer the universe. Will they succeed or fail? Well, it's left up to you to find out in Transformers Beast Wars: Seasons 2 & 3.

What started as campy and kiddie in nature back in the first season has grown more serious in tone in the second and third seasons. Thankfully, it comes to a very satisfying conclusion. Fans of the Generation 1 Tranformers series will come to love this series. I'd never saw this series before and was highly skeptical about it but, after viewing the series, I'm glad I purchased the series. I see, now, why this series is loved so much. You actually get to know the characters in this series and you realize they're not one-dimension characters. They act just like we would in a given situation. Another thing I love about the show is it is strictly sci-fi and I love me some sci-fi.

Seasons 2 and 3 include bonus features such as: Remembering The Spark Featurette,
Original making of Beast Wars, Art gallery and Original character models.

All in all, Beast Wars Transformers is a great show to add to your Transformers collection. It's definitely a show that you will watch over and over again. I agree with another reviewer here, follow this up with The Transformers Beast Machines complete series. It's a fantastic followup to Beast Wars, although it is even more serious and darker in tone.  Beast Machines picks up where the previous Transformers series, Beast Wars, leaves off, with Optimus Primal and the remaining Maximal team returning to their home planet of Cybertron, and still in their animal forms.",1318291200,6,1796,4.821428571428571
4647307,5,B005BUA1H6,"ITEM: Beast Wars seasons 2 & 3 from Shout! Factory, wrapping up their release of the Beast Wars: Transformers series.  This aired '96-'99 as a direct sequel to the original Transformers G1 show (also recently re-released from Shout!), headed by Bob Forward and Larry DiTillio, DiTillio of ""Babylon 5"" fame.

REVIEW: I'm a fan of Transformers, and after seeing G1, I naturally followed it up with Beast Wars.  The robots (now Maximals and Predacons) turn into animals instead of vehicles (to much fan derision), and this Optimus and Megatron are whole new characters.  As a fan of sci-fi and good storytelling in general, I was amazed with the series.  It starts a little cheesey, but it builds in seriousness and creates an overall dark tone.  No story is completely solved in thirty minutes.  It takes the entire series to tell its story - very serialized, which is a huge plus in my book.  The plot continuously thickens, as do it mysteries.  Character development galore, with friendships, betrayals, alliances, and a bit of love thrown in the mix - not to mention the cast's high mortality rate.  As I said, this show starts a tad silly and becomes very dark and mature.  In addition to being the best Transformers show to date, it's one of the best TV shows I've ever seen, one of the most well-written and well-told.  By the latter episodes, it'll have you cheering all the characters in excitement, and it will continuously surprise you.

Yes, this release is new to 2011; yes, there was a release several years ago; good luck finding those though, as each season goes for abut $50.

Follow this up with ""Beast Machines.""",1317686400,2,1628,4.767857142857143

4647320,5,B005BUA1H6,"I didn't know when I bought this that it was an anniversary edition. I opened the package it was mailed, and the first thing out of my mouth was, ""BONUS""! I had bought Season one over a year ago. They had season Two at the time, but I couldn't afford to get the only two seasons they had for Twenty Bucks each. I went back the next payday to get Season Two, but as with most series sold at that store they were sold out and never got it again. They teased me the same way with the old live action Incredible Hulk series. They only carried the first few seasons to get you hooked then cut you off. So I looked over a year for this and I found it here for less than what I paid for season one. Had to get it! Now I am so hooked I have to get Beast Machines to find out the answer to a couple questions. When and how does Megatron Gen. One get his spark back from Megatron Two? What happens to Waspinator after being left on Prehistoric Earth? I loved the references to the toys. BEST TRANSFORMERS MADE!",1373673600,,1000,4.030150753768845
4647321,5,B005BUA1H6,I can't praise this series enough. The story is excellent and the inclusion of G-1 references and story arcs is absolutely amazing. I didn't want it to end even though the last episode seemed a bit rushed.,1373587200,,205,4.5675675675675675
4647322,5,B005BUA1H6,"Even though the series only lasted 3 seasons, it was very entertaining.  I remember watching the episodes when they first aired on television years and years ago and I was very excited when it was finally released to DVD.  I would recommend this series to kids of all ages!",1370217600,,273,4.551020408163265
4647323,5,B005BUA1H6,"This is the season where I really connected this series with the old Transformers show, because- well, you'll see why at the end of season 2.  Anyways, this is even better than season 1, with only 3 episodes below A, & 2 of them are A-.  The best episodes here were always my favorites.  I liked the Transmetal forms better, because well, it felt more like Transformers.  Here's a review of each, with synopsizes from Wikipedia.

27.  Aftermath:  The Transwarp explosion, which results in the destruction of the Vok's artificial moon, unleashes an Energon wave, the impact of which causes some of the Transformers to gain gain new Transmetal forms from its irradiation.  A

28-29.  The Coming of the Fuzors:  Two Fuzors - Silverbolt and Quickstrike - are created from damaged stasis pods, and Megatron is able to convince them to join the Predacons.  This is a perfect story that introduces Silverbolt, my 2nd favorite Transformer (no, he doesn't stay with the Predacons, anyone who saw the commercials for the fuzors knew that), with some great touches (that Western music that plays at the end of part 1 is the greatest piece of music ever written for this show).  A+

30. Tangled Web:  Tarantulas, Quickstrike, and Blackarachnia are sent to secure a new Predacon post, but their conflicting intentions and the intervention of Rattrap and Silverbolt complicate things.  A great episode that shows the start of Silverbolt & Blackarachnia's beautiful relationship.  A

31.  Maximal, No More:  While on a reconnaissance mission, Dinobot is captured by the Predacons. Instead of fighting them he announces that he wants to be a Predacon again.  Any Dinobot-focused episode is excellent in my book.  A+

32-33.  Other Visits:  After discovering a new alien device, the Maximals and Predacons battle for control of the weapon.  A lot of other stuff happens, but I won't spoil it for you.  A+

34.  Spark of Darkness:  The psychotic Protoform X crashes on Earth and attacks Maximal and Predacon alike.  One of the scariest episodes ever.  A+

35.  Code of Hero:  The Predacons attempt to annihilate a colony of pre-humans to change the outcome of the future war between the Autobots and Decepticons.  With no other Maximal around, Dinobot faces the whole Predacon army alone in battle.  This is widely considered the best episode, & you'll know why when you see it.  A+

36.  Transmutate:  A faulty Transformer named Transmutate is created from a damaged stasis pod.  Silverbolt and Rampage compete for its trust.  A well-done, mature episode; but it is depressing.  A-

37-39.  The Agenda:  The Tripredacus Council is hit by the explosion caused by the destruction of the alien device in ""Other Voices"", and recognize the signal as being from Megatron's ship.  After blocking the wave from reaching the Maximals, they send a covert operative to capture Megatron.  The agent turns out to be ex-Decepticon Ravage, who makes an alliance with the Maximals in order to capture Megatron.  This is the greatest multi-parter the show has done, apart from maybe the series finale.  I was one of the few of my generation who appreciated the full significance of what was going on.  As soon as I recognized Ravage, I knew this was going to be especially good.  A+

40.  Optimal Situation:  As the Maximals begin to fade from the time stream, there is still time to save Optimus Prime's life.  A near-perfect start to the third season.  A

41.  Deep Metal:  Depth Charge, a Maximal from Colony Omicron, arrives on planet Earth looking for Protoform X, wanting revenge on Rampage for killing his comrades long ago.  Depth Charge may not necessarily be my fourth favorite Transformer, but he is my fourth favorite character in the series.  A

42.  Changing of the Guard:  After failing to set up base defenses, the Maximals attempt to salvage Sentinel from the wreckage of the Axalon.  Rattrap pilots a submarine into the submerged ship.  This is the worst Beast Wars episode ever.  It started off good, but them constantly losing & gaining Sentinel reminded my dad of the Keystone Cops.  It certainly wasn't what I came to expect from BW.  And besides, it didn't make any sense.  Wouldn't they have salvaged Sentinel to start with?  D+

43.  Cutting Edge:  Megatron sends several prototype Transmetal II cyber-raptors to attack the early humans and the Maximals. Depending on who perfects it first, the new technology has great potential in determining the outcome of the war.  Much better.  A

44-45.  Feral Scream:  Megatron creates a Transmetal II clone of Dinobot, and Cheetor and Depth Charge attempt to interrupt the process; instead, Cheetor is presumed dead after he is exposed to the machine in an explosion.  The Predacons soon come under attack from a mysterious feral beast, as a heavily damaged Cheetor returns to Maximal base.  Apart from a contrived moment in the first part, this is an excellent 2-part story.  I have to admit Cheetor was my least favorite character in the series, but this is where he gets better.  A

46.  Proving Grounds:  When Optimus decides to surgically remove Blackarachnia's Predacon core, without regard for the risk to her, she runs away, and is hunted by Dinobot II.  Simply one of the best episodes in my opinion.  A+

47.  Go With the Flow:  Megatron kidnaps a young protohuman, Una, to finish a giant disruptor ray that targets Cybertronians.  This is a funny episode that's actually a great homage to the original Transformers season 2 episodes (where Megatron kept trying to destroy the Autobots with super weapons of the week).  A-

48.  Crossing the Rubicon:  Blackarachnia attempts to become a Transmetal II with the help of the alien device she had stolen.  However, thanks to the intervention of Silverbolt, the experiment takes a terrible turn and threatens her life.  A+

49.  Master Blaster:  During an attack on the Maximal base, Optimus is hit with a burrowing cyberbug that allows Quickstrike to take control of his body.  A great episode that begins the final story.  A

50.  Other Victories:  Quickstrike is put to trial for his betrayal of Megatron, but it is interrupted when the Vok send Tigerhawk to stop Megatron's interference with time.  They do not realize, however, that Megatron has part of his predecessor's spark within him, thus destroying him would cause another timestorm.  Tigerhawk was a character I really wanted to see on the show, & was ecstatic when he appeared.  A+

51-52.  Nemesis:  With the destruction of the Predacon base, Megatron is forced into a corner once again as the Maximals hunt for him.  Megatron sends Inferno, Waspinator, and Quickstrike to find a new base, while he goes with Dinobot and Rampage to search the debris of Tarantulas' lair for anything that may turn the tide for the Predacons.  They find an underground passage that leads to a minisub that runs on a submerged track - which in reality leads to the Nemesis - the almighty Decepticon warship piloted by Megatron that first attacked the Ark on the way to Earth.  Like I said, this is an excellent series finale. A+

While I have to admit that on their own I do prefer the second season over the third, they are still great seasons overall. If you have the first season, you must buy this one.  This is honestly the greatest Transformers DVD set in my collection.  As for Beast Machines, well, just stay tuned & you'll see a review for it.  For the record, it's my fifth favorite Transformers series.",1369353600,,7447,4.870993589743589

4647328,5,B005BUA1H6,"This is an excellent set. I already bought the first Rhino sets of Season 2 and 3, but I was drawn in by the special features on this combined 2 and 3 edition. Very much worth the price! And for only $20 for this ""backup"" set of Season 2 and 3 I have now from Target? To quote Megs from Season 1's The Probe: ""Oh, EXCELLENT idea!""

: Remembering The Spark is good, running at 18 minutes, 14 seconds. It includes portions of the original Larry and Bob interviews from Rhino's BW Season 1 release. Key clips from the series are played during Bob and Larry's audio. My favorite clips are from The Agenda Trilogy and an 'optimal' situation, Yess... Christopher Brough, producer from Mainframe, provides information as well.

Here is what I found very interesting. Steve Drucker, Hasbro VP, says that the Beast Warriors arrive in/on Earth's past BEFORE the Ark crashlands. Now, I originally thought that if THAT was the case, both Maximal and Predacon bases' scanners would have DETECTED the Ark crashing. That would be logical, wouldn't it? I personally think he might have gotten his facts a little mixed up. I was under the impression that the Beast Warriors arrived AFTER the Ark had ALREADY crashed, which is supported by the brief G1 recap as told to Silverbolt in The Agenda 2. I'd like to know where he got that piece of information from or if it is just pure speculation on his part. I would like to talk to Mr. Drucker further on this, yess.

: The Original Makring Of Featurette is next. Mairi Welman of Mainframe Entertainment kicks it off. My personal favorite sections from this are brief shots of Gary Chalk, Jim Byrnes, Doug Parker, Ian James Corlett, Scott McNeil in front of the microphone during original recording sessions for ""Law Of The Jungle""!

The only thing this set does not have is the Nemesis Part 2 animatic or deletec scene like the Rhino release of Season 3. Besides that, I highly recommend this release!",1322179200,2,1932,4.640350877192983
