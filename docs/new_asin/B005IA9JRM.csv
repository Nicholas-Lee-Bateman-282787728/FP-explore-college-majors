4708280,5,B005IA9JRM,"The DVD package is great, 2 DVDs sold together on sale. I enjoy the TV show very much and slowly collecting all the DVDs, very excited I was able to buy them at a cheaper price. Wooohooooo",1362096000,,188,4.108108108108108
4708281,5,B005IA9JRM,"The fifth and sixth seasons of Friends are in my opinion the best seasons.  Chandler and Monica get together in season five and at first they hide their relationship from everyone, Ross Marries then divorces Emily, then in season six Ross marries then divorces Rachel! LOL But, Chandler moves in with Monica and at the end of season six they get engaged! Both seasons are really good. The price of this combo pack is great and there are extended scenes you don't see on t.v.!  I think it's a really good deal you won't find anywhere else.",1360022400,9,538,4.536082474226804

4708307,5,B005IA9JRM,Love this series and now I own them all.  Don't understand pricing though.  I only need one more but it was way cheaper to buy in groups of two and I had already received the others that way except one.  To buy season 7 was twice the price so I had to order the 7th season elsewhere.,1424563200,,283,3.9298245614035086

It was my favorite way to unwind at the end of the day... but sadly, they decided to show it later now. Well, this gal goes to bed before it airs. Thankfully, I have DVD's now so I don't have to hate the TV station and their changing of the schedule.",1415577600,,383,4.052631578947368

4708336,5,B005IA9JRM,"I totally would rate this a 10, if I could! I am a major Friends fan, and miss them more and more all the time. A friend bought me Seasons 1-4 for Christmas, and we rolled right through those. As soon as the end was in sight, I purchased this set of Seasons 5 and 6. Once we're done with these, we'll be ordering the next one.... I dread the end (Again!).
This was one of the best shows around, in my opinion. Funny cast, and made it feel like they were OUR FRIENDS!!",1403136000,,467,3.978723404255319
4708337,5,B005IA9JRM,Don't purchase the Blu-Ray version till they do it right like this complete collection.  The picture may not be widescreen but it is what you seen on TV plus little extra.  The Blu-ray version is just a cropped version of this with shorter episodes.  Glad I didn't wait to long and miss out on these.,1401062400,,300,4.418181818181818
4708338,3,B005IA9JRM,the video quality is poor:  not a clear picture and it seems to not be synching voices with mouth movements...,1399248000,3,110,4.5
4708339,5,B005IA9JRM,"We wanted to slowly collect all the season to this great series, and we now have them! Excellent quality in both the packaging and the dvd's themselves. No issues with their play either.",1398816000,,186,4.666666666666667
4708340,5,B005IA9JRM,"My wife likes Friends so I decided to -- eventually -- get her the whole series. Thought I had to buy each season one DVD at a time, but found these double packs. For not much more than a single season, you get two. It's a no-brainer. Quality has been good (we've done two of these packs so far). No complaints.",1398816000,,311,4.114754098360656
4708341,5,B005IA9JRM,"Bought this as a package bargain price deal.  I love Friends, so I added to my set for a reasonable price.  Chandler and Monica are married and Rachel and Ross ""accidently"" tie the knot too.  Lots of fun and some pain, as real life friends go through. Highly recommend if you are a Friends fan like me.",1398556800,,302,4.2631578947368425

4708344,3,B005IA9JRM,"The discs were in perfect condition, just hated that season six is a different case than the rest of the series. Not a huge deal, just a little OCD and would have preferred they all match.",1397433600,,188,4.25

4708349,5,B005IA9JRM,The fifth and sixth seasons of friends are great we watch them over and over again. They are funny and fun to watch,1393286400,,115,4.043478260869565
4708350,4,B005IA9JRM,I am thinking on buying this but DOES IT HAVE SUBTITLES INCLUDED? can someone who bought it verify this for me please?,1393200000,,118,4.409090909090909
4708351,4,B005IA9JRM,"There weren't any CDs in the season 6 dvd case. It was brand new and wrapped, however, NO CDS! NONE! I was so appalled because obviously I was excited to watch season 6 after season 5 (Yes, I love Friends and the season finale cliff hanger....!). So I called Amazon and they are sending me a replacement... So 4 stars for customer service. And minus 1 star for giving me a half empty product in the first place. I still love Friends.",1392940800,,433,4.2926829268292686

4708354,5,B005IA9JRM,I still watch this show. My entire family lives it. Great to see my kids watch Ann episode for the first time.,1391126400,,110,4.045454545454546

4708359,5,B005IA9JRM,"I bought the entire series throughout this year and have been watching it most of the time. While I prefer the earlier seasons episodes, seasons 1-7, there were enough funny episodes in the 8- 10 seasons to warrant purchasing them all.",1387324800,,235,4.7560975609756095
4708360,5,B005IA9JRM,"Gift for Daughter. Was going to go with the complete set, but was a lot more expensive. Went this way and it was the best way to go. Great and funny. Can't go wrong with that!",1384387200,,175,3.888888888888889
4708361,2,B005IA9JRM,Because is the not the same model and box -presentation- that I have the other seasons. It does not match with my collection,1383782400,2,124,4.434782608695652
4708362,5,B005IA9JRM,What I like about the packaging is that all episodes for the season are squished into 4 discs and all 4 discs are in one case.  Nice and tidy and convenient for storage and travel.,1382918400,,180,4.142857142857143

4708365,5,B005IA9JRM,"I have finally gotten all of the seasons, the majority from Amazon, I wish they had continued for a few more seasons but oh well.  I watch them all the time. I highly recommend Friends to anyone looking for a good laugh.",1379289600,3,220,4.238095238095238
4708366,1,B005IA9JRM,"I was so looking forward to receiving the Fifth & Sixth Seasons as I hadn't seen all of Friends ever.  The second disc (I think) of the Fifth Season has audio issues and I can't hear it.  Season Six has issues with the voice not matching the mouths as the actors are speaking and it is awful to watch.  How do you make this right for me since I have paid my money?  If there is no way, I will never purchase another item from Amazon.",1379289600,4,433,4.0
4708367,5,B005IA9JRM,This was a great price for 2 seasons. They also look great and work perfectly. I would definitely recommend you buy them this way instead of the whole series.,1377043200,,158,4.482758620689655

4708371,5,B005IA9JRM,I love this show and all of the characters in it. I found this for a real good price and I am going to look for more deals like this to add to my collection. Thank u.,1370476800,,166,3.5135135135135136
4708372,5,B005IA9JRM,"I bought this for my girlfriend.  She watched Friends on TV originally and wanted to watch it again in order.  So we have slowly been collecting the seasons.  I checked around and I think the 2 season combo is the way to go.  I paid $19.99 and it qualified for free super saver shipping.  That is only $10.00 a season for a brand new copy.  It seemed the individual seasons cost about $15 new.  Used copys can be a little bit cheaper, but then you never really know what the condition will be.

It is a funny show too.  If you haven't watched it before and you are looking for a chuckle, I would check it out.",1369699200,,609,4.136752136752137
4708373,5,B005IA9JRM,"I'm behind on the times. I didn't start watching Friends until I accidentilly caught a marathon on tv a few months ago, now I'm going back and watching every episode in order. This is the cheapest way to go, 2 seasons for the price of one.",1368057600,,239,4.217391304347826
4708374,5,B005IA9JRM,I bought all 10 seasons for $100!  You get two complete sets for $20.  Unless you are looking for all the extras from a box set (which isn't worth the extra money to me) you cannot go wrong.,1367280000,,190,3.973684210526316
4708375,5,B005IA9JRM,Love this show. Great price for two seasons! Excellent packaging and like that it is so slim so easy storage,1366934400,2,108,4.45

4708377,4,B005IA9JRM,"How can a show like this stay so fresh and simple?  Great writing, editing, producing, and casting!

4708382,5,B005IA9JRM,"This is a great series for anyone that loves a quick laugh. The show is funny, climactic at points and dramatic. It plays on several stereotypes and satirizes several aspects of society. My only recommendation? Start with season 1!",1363737600,,231,4.948717948717949

8474332,5,B005IA9JRM,"It's Friends...what more do i need to say? I was a college student when the show debuted, and I followed it through to its final season, always watching reruns when i could catch them. Although the characters may not have made choices you always agreed with, you couldn't help but feel connected to them as a young 20-something. And while it is no Princess Bride, I cannot think of another TV show as quotable (and recognizable by those quotes).",1494806400,,445,4.6455696202531644

It got me through high school (and we all know how much that place sucks), college, break ups, marriage, and everything in between.  No matter what I am doing I always know I can turn on an episode of Friends and everything will be all right in the world.  The last two seasons were not as good as the first 8 but they are still good.  I so hope there is a friends reunion show so we can see what happens to everyone.  This is hands down my absolute favorite show ever made.",1481760000,,615,4.213675213675214
