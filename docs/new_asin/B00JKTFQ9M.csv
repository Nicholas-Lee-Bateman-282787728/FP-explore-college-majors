6373710,4,B00JKTFQ9M,This movie is good fun. Good production quality for an indie film. Has a good plot line and is suspenseful. It is always painful watching characters who are in over their heads and heading for disaster.,1405728000,,202,4.638888888888889
6373711,2,B00JKTFQ9M,"Not very thrilling. A lot of the film was spent building up to nothing, and not much goes on.",1405382400,,93,3.9473684210526314
6373712,2,B00JKTFQ9M,"Lots of screaming, yelling, and old fashion foolishness inside the movie content and I personally couldn't handle all the childish bickering. Almost shut it down a couple times.

This was obviously a very low budget movie as you never actually see a bigfoot creature (except for a shadow or two at best.)
Don't waste your time and money on this one as I did.",1405296000,3,358,4.59375

6373715,1,B00JKTFQ9M,"Devoid of chills or storyline, ""Hunting the Legend"" is a must-avoid. These movies depend on improv for the most part and this is, without question, the worst improv I've ever seen in a found-footage movie. Nothing frightening happens and there is no suspense, just an hour and a half of very, very bad improv by four twenty-somethings.  And I thought ""Crybaby Bridge"" was amateurish -- it's ""Citizen Kane"" compared to ""Hunting the Legend."" I like found footage movies and am willing to put up with a lot as part of my love of the genre, but even I have my limits!  Don't make my mistake, avoid this film.",1404864000,8,604,4.583333333333333
6373716,4,B00JKTFQ9M,"It was just as described by GHOSTSTAR.....a really really good found footage film - and I really really liked it!  Now, I know we've seen our share of the found footage films this year but do yourself a favor and take a chance on this one.  Let me just say that I hope ""Hannah"" was indulging in the obnoxiousness of her character because there were a few times I hoped for something to skin her up but alas, no such luck.

Other than Hannah getting on my last nerve in a couple of scenes, I have nothing to complain about and hope that doesn't deter you from viewing.  As a whole, it was a pleasure to be frightened, intrigued and captured by this story along with the characters - all of which were quite believable.  This film had me from the first ""ACTION"" all the way to ""CUT; THAT'S A WRAP.""

NOTE TO VIEWERS:  Be sure to wait until the very very very very last second to stop the movie; you don't want to miss that last.........gotcha!  tee-hee",1404864000,3,950,4.297752808988764
6373717,4,B00JKTFQ9M,"This movie is ,believe it or not,...is way better than the cover art would lead you to believe !
The production quality is great for a found footage movie,...it was filmed in a beliveable manner.
The cast of youngsters where extreamly beliveable and realistic !
There are some twists that get your emotions involved with the cast.
Although the plot is somewhat to be expected,.. it is exicuted very well,.. that ends up being a good bigfoot movie !
I liked the film more than i thought i would,..if you like bigfoot movies,.. this one is worth your time!
I almost believed that it was a true story,.. it was so well exicuted !

6373744,1,B00JKTFQ9M,"Basic Plot Spoilers.

This is another hand held camera hunting Bigfoot tale. Just because it takes place in Alabama doesn't mean it can't be as bad as ""Willow Creek."" It is. Christopher Copeland is looking for Bigfoot, because it killed his father. This as you ""National Enquirer"" readers know this is a problem in the rural south along with the alien probings. As a young adult, Chris assembles a posse to go after Bigfoot which include his friend Jeff and sniveling girlfriend Hannah. There is also a camera and sound man who speak about 70 minutes into the film.

They film themselves getting guns from guy-in-trailer, obtaining a dog and then directions from a guy named Rick who owns a guitar shop. They meet a mountain man who ""lives off the land"" in his cabin with electricity and fake fireplace on loop. There is a lot of internal drama and conflict, I wasn't sure what it was about, except everyone wanted to quit and go back, but never at the same time. So we had to sit through 30 minutes of whine and self induced drama while they freak over a skinned bunny.

As in most hand held films, tears of boredom are created until the last few minutes when the producers decide they can't afford to give you a decent Bigfoot scene, so they jerk the camera around and have people scream and then the proverbial floor/ground cam. Oh yeah. That makes it real.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex, no nudity, no Bigfoot.",1420934400,3,1407,4.549407114624506
6373745,2,B00JKTFQ9M,"Do you like found footage movies of whiney, obnoxious, fighting teenagers?  Then by all means - order this!  I love the found footage genre - but the kids in this movie were so annoying that I literally wanted to reach in the screen and smack them.  A few good scares, but mostly just 3 kids wandering around a sparce forest waiting for something to jump out and eat them.  Sadly...it didn't happen for over an hour.",1418860800,3,416,4.434210526315789
6373756,4,B00JKTFQ9M,"Not bad. Actually I was surprised by the quality, acting and story line. MUCH better than ""Lost Coast Tapes,"" although similar in characters without the paranormal stuff. Fairly decent for its genre. Builds suspense in a Hitchcockian way. I probably wouldn't buy it but good for a Saturday afternoon monster movie rental.",1417910400,,321,5.1923076923076925

6373758,2,B00JKTFQ9M,I never write reviews but this is a total hoax movie no found footage and just a lot of arguing and screaming and stupid things no one would really do if this had been real. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!,1414281600,,198,3.975
6373759,3,B00JKTFQ9M,"I found this found footage bigfoot movie a bit more interesting than ""Willow Creek"" and provided a bit more suspense. Unlike some of the other reviewers (use the term loosely at times as ""Worst. Movie. Ever"" isn't a review), I found the acting to be good considering I had never heard of any of the actors.

The basic story id the lead witnesses his father being killed by a bigfoot and getting proof of the creatures becomes his mission. Fast forward 6 years and he and some friends (along with a camera crew) set out into the same woods. The glimpses of the creatures worked for me (based on the hokey SyFy looking cover, this is better than a lame looking costume if the budget wasn't there.)

One of the problems here (along with other FF movies) is that there were multiple cameras used (a couple of GO Pros & the camera crew) and the footage looks to edited together rather than a single camera (I guess they found all the cameras and memory cards/tapes?) and the final footage is out of place since the camera wouldn't have been ""found"" (if you see the flick, you'll know what I mean.)

All in all a decent romp and you could do far worse as far as a bigfoot movie goes.",1414108800,3,1177,4.365296803652968
6373760,3,B00JKTFQ9M,"I was definitely pleasantly surprised by this one. I am a huge ""found footage"" fan, and have waded through perhaps 100+ b-movies. This one, for me, made the cut for the ones I'd recommend. I won't give any spoilers here, but less was more! And the acting was above average. Im usually a pretty harsh critic, but I really can't find much to slam that won't give away the fun. It's worth one rental, not a buy.",1413331200,3,408,4.311688311688312

6373764,3,B00JKTFQ9M,"There are alot of bigfoot found footage movies out there, from Bigfoot County, Bigfoot: The Lost Coast Tapes, Happy Camp, Willow Creek and Exists coming out in October. Hunting The Legend is a decent one if you like those kinds of movies like I do. This young adult looking to find what killed his father and some friends go along with him. Camera quality is good. But it is a movie where you just want and wish you could knock his girlfriend out for being annoying. It is worth a watch if you like found footage bigfoot movies, and it isn't all too boring.",1410998400,4,557,4.365384615384615
6373765,4,B00JKTFQ9M,"Okay, I just finished the movie and I was pleasantly surprised. Perhaps I'm letting this surprise skew a higher than deserved review. On the other hand, I have no idea how others ranked it so low.

This is an excellent wood ape movie!  I was impressed that one guy wrote, directed, filmed and acted in the production. Very skilled individual.

It was well researched and included traits of the ""legend"" that aren't that well known by the public (example: wood knocks).  I thought the acting was very good -- especially the scenes where they breakdown from being frightened.  I camp in the deep woods often and I've seen people go into a cocoon when critters are walking around the campsite.

The movie was suspenseful. I suggest watching it late at night with the lights turned off. Yes, it might start off a little slow, but not any slower than Blair Witch. I also liked the ending that has a twist to make you think and debate.  If you liked Blair Witch and you are interested in wood apes, you will love this movie IMHO.",1410652800,2,1023,4.5271739130434785

6373775,2,B00JKTFQ9M,"Man,...another great opportunity missed!  I was pumped when I first heard about this movie.  That's where the excitement ends, however.  If you've read any of my other reviews, you might know I'm a HUGE ""found footage"" fan.  This seems like the perfect scenario to showcase that, but they completely missed the mark.  It did seem like there was a total lack of script and a few lines should have been there just to make sure they stayed on track, but for the most part, I didn't find that to be the deal breaker.  What got me was the 1:20+ minutes of them wandering through the woods complaining to each other with NOTHING else happening.  You get the stories from some people's sightings (these actually feel like real stories the people are telling).  I'm not sure if those people were actors or not, but they did a pretty good job. The final 10 minutes of the movie are the only interesting part and even that isn't that good.  We never actually get to see the Bigfoot?!  This is a catch 22.  I'm pretty sure if we HAD seen it, it would have been horrible looking, but I really would have liked to see something.  All in all, I thought the ""production"" of the movie was great (as far as a found footage movie goes) but the rest of it completely missed the mark.

Final Verdict:  Pass.  It's just not that interesting.",1406764800,2,1320,4.441666666666666

I don't know why some of the reviews claim it's the worst movie ever, obviously they haven't seen some of the turkeys I've seen, since this one was no where near as bad as the worst movies I've ever seen. They did spend a lot of time just interviewing people and later walking through the woods, I guess they could have shortened some of those sequences.  To start with though, I didn't really care for the lead character, he was kind of an idiot who was totally obsessed with killing a bigfoot, to the point of not noticing anything else that was going on.  And his 2 friends weren't much better since they enabled him, and indeed, one of them became probably even crazier than he was, and for what? As the story went along, about the only character I cared about was the dog, I was hoping he would run away and stay away from them, because it was obvious nothing good was going to happen for them. Naturally, this being a found footage movie, there were many unanswered questions here, but with a bit of an intriguing last minute ending that was a bit unexpected.",1499817600,2,1171,4.416666666666667
