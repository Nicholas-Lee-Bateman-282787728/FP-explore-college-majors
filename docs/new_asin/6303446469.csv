7846907,4,6303446469,"HBO's JACK DEMPSEY consists primarily of excerpts from a considerably older sports documentary, one that features brief narrated clips of eight fights, including a 1940 exhibition against a massive wrestler, during Jack's age 45 comeback quest. It was for Dempsey both a victory and his boxing swan song.

Nothing is told of Dempsey's pre-boxing life as a rail-riding vagrant. Post-career, it's mentioned in passing that he bought a restaurant with saved prize purses. And that's it. We do learn however that as champ Jack trounced an opponent from France by knocking him down 11 times and was roundly booed for it. Because of this fight, Jack was forever after branded a ""thug,"" perhaps justifiably. During a later match against Jack Sharkey, Dempsey low-blowed his opponent and then sucker-punched Sharkey while he protested the previous hit to the referee.

Best highlights are from the very first bout, where the Manassas Mauler won his title. This venerable 1919 footage is projected in real time, which lends a choppy, stroboscopic movement, yet it's still preferable to silent 18 fps film run at an artifically fast 24 fps, as is so common with modern dubs of pre-sound movies.

On occasion my father would take me with him when he would visit Jack to borrow cash to buy a new vehicle. Jack always had an upbeat demeanor and was the source of my perpetual enthusiasm for life. As tough as he was in the ring, he was equally as sweet in his everyday life. There were few relatives I thought more highly of than Jack Dempsey, my godfather.

7846909,3,6303446469,"As an amateur boxing historian, I love watching old films of legends like Jack Dempsey.  For that reason I find the HBO series ""Boxing's Best"" very interesting to watch, because it has plenty of unique clips  of these legends.  However, my biggest complaint is that the series does  not show enough fight clips.  In my opinion, too much time is spent with  host Barry Tompkins and his special guests.  I'd rather see more of  Dempsey's classic bouts than listening to some sportswriter's memories.  This is especially true since each episode of ""Boxing's Best""  only lasts about 55 minutes.  However, since videos of Dempsey, Johnson and  Louis are almost impossible to find anywhere else, I guess you have to be  somewhat grateful to the producers for releasing this series to home video.",946857600,11,789,4.931297709923665
