4042971,5,B00308BAXK,"Faith Based Filming has come a long way toward taking their place alongside typical Hollywood flicks. It is shown to be a lower budget production from viewing the bonus behind the scenes material, where cast double as filming assistants but the job gets done, and done well. In this case it tells a TRUE story, perhaps somewhat altered to get years down to minutes, but the drama is certainly encapsulated. It is the story of Amy Newhouse, her battle with cancer, the ups and downs, and the faith and hope that she was able to not only keep herself, but pass along to others during the ordeal.

What a perfect choice it was to cast Anne Underwood as Amy. She is joy personified. Her bubbly personality is contagious right off the screen. She is only the first of truly believable characters in this film. Another that must be mentioned is Paul Willis playing a teen with punk hair. I'm a retired teacher, and believe me when I say these two were honestly teen-realistic. I've taught hundreds like them.

Bradley Dorsey as Tyler is the love angle in Amy's life. He looks the part (so young) of a lovesick teen boy until you see Behind the Scenes and see him as director (also writer, producer, editor, and who knows what else. There is a wait, but in Dec 2012, his new film is to be released which he does many roles again including lead, joined by Della Reese and Michael Gross. There's a step up.

While this is definitely faith based, it is not Christianity in your face, unless you take the role of Amy to heart, which you should, because she was a teenage on-fire Christian and planning for the mission field. God had a different story in mind. Watch this film and see it revealed. Well done Mr. Dorsey, cast and crew.

4042972,5,B00308BAXK,"We greatly enjoyed this movie. It will have you rejoicing one moment and welling up with tears the next. It is an awesome story of faith and perserverance, and when it's all said and done, you come to realize (if you don't already) that our God is sovereign, and in the end, it is His will that will be done. I strongly recommend this movie for any one, but especially for church teen groups and young adults. I am a pastor and I will be showing this movie in our church.",1289260800,25,471,4.186813186813187
4042973,5,B00308BAXK,"The faith this young girl shows is amazing. It makes you think, do I have that kind of faith? Could I have that kind of faith, if it was me, or one of my loved ones. WOW",1275004800,10,169,3.5945945945945947
4042974,3,B00308BAXK,"Half way decent movie! As a born again believer, it just wasn't as Biblically orientated as I'd hoped it would be! Talked a lot about prayer, which is great, but I hoped it'd talk about accepting Jesus as Saviour!",1437436800,,213,4.487179487179487

4042991,5,B00308BAXK,"I have seen this movie before, and for me it was quite inspiring.  That is why I purchased it for my soon to be, 12 year old grandchild. Life has not always been easy for her, but I thought this story of Amy Newhouse would inspire her. I think it is important for all of us, young and old alike, to be reminded that God loves us and has a plan for each of us. As we are mere mortals, we do not see, as God sees. We think He has forgotten us (myself included). Even the very faithful, Amy, began disbelieving His Promises. The story is Happy and Sad, but most of all this story inspires. I feel it will be an excellent gift for my ""almost teenager"" as the main character is a high school junior.",1408406400,12,694,4.028985507246377

4042995,3,B00308BAXK,"A little cheesy at first... Probably both the screenplay and the acting at fault. However, it has a really good overall message concerning the Sovereignty of God and it's based on a true story. With all of the trash that comes out on tv and in the movies today I would say that this was a good buy. My wife showed it to girls in our youth group and 1/3 of the way through the movie everyone was sniffling. And the demographic for our group is multicultural, middle-lower class economically in a city-town hybrid 20 minutes outside of NYC.",1400025600,12,538,4.444444444444445

4042997,3,B00308BAXK,"I have to admit that though we thoroughly enjoy the Godly bent of this (reportedly true) story, it is probably not what we would veiw again or suggest to a friend. The end is just too sad.",1392595200,4,188,4.108108108108108

4043000,5,B00308BAXK,"I am very pleased with this Faith  Based Movie! I also feel ""Hollywood ""is starting to feel a difference In ""Faith Based Movies""! For one thing The actors Who are WELL  KNOWN  Aren't afraid To be( BLack Listed In Hollywood)  New Comers, These People really put Their Hearts into it! I know People Especially with Families really like these  movie! It is about REAL LIFE Situations ! When You have to depend On Something (besides Yourself,  You NEED  Faith! ) I think the days when the violence & sex have been so popular ,Now You don't have to watch it on the screen when it's happening ALL Around Us (in Real Life) it is just reminding Us of Every day Life .The criminals rights are being  abused, While the victims lives & Their Families are left in Ruins ! There are some  well known actors now staring  in These Movies ! For Example ,Kevin Sorbo, John Ratzenger  , (What If)...  John Schneider ,(Octobers' Baby,WWJD  Hidden Secrets , You remember"" Dukes of Hazard "" there are others,  ""Casting Crowns""  song based entertainers are  involved in several of these movies ....There are More actors(Of Course, Kirk Cameron  (Bosom Buddies) Fire  Proof ,He has a New Movie out  Susan Howard (Star Track,Dallas) Dean Cain ,Etc.
