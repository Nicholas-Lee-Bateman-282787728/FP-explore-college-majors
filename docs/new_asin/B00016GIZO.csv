Samia Gamal is a wonderful dancer in this, and I enjoy trying to analyze how she does her moves so I can duplicate them.",1373241600,,288,4.627450980392157
8007191,5,B00016GIZO,"It would help if seller stated that movie will only play on PC. With that aside, and considering this movie is old, (1950) and in black & white, it is surprisingly well reproduced. The picture is crisp and unimpeded by any pixel or digital deficiencies. The sound, however, can be better, but on the whole is very good, and the music is clear. The movie is very nice to watch, and of course the music and dancing is just lovely. Very good quality, and a very good seller.",1359763200,,471,4.363636363636363
8007192,4,B00016GIZO,"This classic movie has been wonderfully transferred to DVD. The quality of the picture and sound is superb, and the subs titles are noticeable but not terribly intrusive. I give this two thumbs up",1323820800,,196,4.794117647058823
8007193,5,B00016GIZO,"I bought this dvd for my father who is in his 80's, he loves it very much. He was not able to see it at the time it was first released so he was very happy to see a movie he thought he would never be able to watch.",1242259200,6,214,3.3877551020408165
