6244255,5,B00HZMZ218,"This is a great movie. The subject will actually probably limit it's audience for decades. The stories told are real,diverse and 3 dimensional and for the amount of time needed to tell them, the limits of screen time, were well exercised.

As a drag racing fan, it is probably the best piece of cinema ever devoted to any part of the subject, as is 'Heart Like a Wheel'

The acting was never questionable and the screenplay was streamlined and able to deliver 40 years of racing history, two careers in depth and two completely different social lives in one pleasant sitting.

Great film, make sure to remind your non racing friend about the advances to everyone's vehicles due to guys like these.

Great film, period correct, no glaring Hollywood errors.",1393977600,34,755,4.7846153846153845
