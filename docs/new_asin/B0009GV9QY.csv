2289705,5,B0009GV9QY,"My favorite out of all in my collection.  Glad they finally have a DVD!  You won't be sad, buy it cycle fans!",1122249600,9,109,3.909090909090909
2289731,5,B0009GV9QY,Dude takes himself pretty darn serious -- but he does hold your attention and by the end it is a satisfying workout.  This DVD has two good spinning workouts.,1326067200,,158,4.448275862068965
2289732,4,B0009GV9QY,"I did a lot of research on spin videos before I purchased this one.  I wanted to get back into shape after years of taking a break.  I bought a spin bike because my legs have generally been the strongest part of my body and therefore the easiest way to get back into a routine.  I purchased a spin bike, a heart rate monitor and this video.  Even for a beginner it was easy to follow.  I don't think the video is cheesy like others had said.  Robert Sherman does a decent job of keeping you motivated and he spins while giving direction so if you're not sure you can just watch him.  The music is a little outdated but no video is going to fit the music tastes of the masses anyway.  The fitness level of the video is moderate but as a beginner I just used my heart rate monitor and reacted however I thought was appropriate. I went online and googled ""spin heart rate chart"".  While watching the video, if my heart rate was between 65 and 85% for my age, Id try to follow the video the best I could.  If I was too tired to raise out of the saddle, Id stay seated and just raise the resistance level.  If my heart rate was above 85%, Id take it a little easier so that my heart rate fell to within the appropriate range.  Overall though I kept petaling no matter what and was able to build a good aerobic base.

The video is divided into two sections: foundations and intervals.  I did the foundations segment for the first few weeks and learned the basics and then transitioned to intervals which gave me the best workout.  Each segment includes a warmup, workout and cool down.  They last about 50 minutes which is appropriate for the amount of time that I had.

I would recommend this video for beginners to moderates but as you get more and more serious about spinning I would transition to a higher intensity video.",1315008000,2,1820,4.2748538011695905
2289733,3,B0009GV9QY,"So far this is my favorite cycling workout.  It is definitely challenging.  I tend to mute the sound to avoid listening to Robert Sherman. Several of his motivational pep talks are demotivational.  One segment goes like this...""Inside I know you want to give up, inside I know you want to sit down, stay with me a little longer....""  It makes me want to get out of my bike and put a duct tape over his mouth.",1310515200,,408,4.328947368421052
2289734,5,B0009GV9QY,"I am new to spinning. This is the first DVD I have tried, aside from what is available on youtube.  I really like this DVD.  It gives you two (2) 44 minute workouts.  Robert Sherman trains you well on the fundamentals of sitting, shoulders, hands, arms, etc.  I have seen an incredible difference in my ability to ride in just two weeks, as well as a difference in the ""love handles"" I had - they are almost gone:)  Get ready to sweat - enjoy!",1308268800,3,443,4.226190476190476
2289735,5,B0009GV9QY,"If you spin indoors, get this DVD!
I have used several indoor DVD's including Coach Troy's spinervals series. Don't get me wrong I like Coach Troy to prep for outside riding..
But this DVD was the best for indoor cycling.  I ride outside also, so I know the proper techniques for that.
However, techniques for indoor riding are different. Robert shows the right way to ride inside.
He comes across a bit ""cheesy"" at first- you can see his make-up, including the blush they put on his cheeks-why, I am not sure.... But once I got past that, I took him seriously, and he had great advice.
More indoor cycling instructors should follow his techniques to prevent injury and to improve muscle development.
Enjoy your ride.

2289736,5,B0009GV9QY,"Cycle Reebok: Foundations and Interval Training with Robert Sherman

Great 2 options available. Very challenging. Lots of endurance training.",1269388800,,141,6.421052631578948
2289737,4,B0009GV9QY,"I was a little skeptical when I read some of the negative reviews that said Robert Sherman was mono-tone.  So I purchased one of his and two of Mindy Mylrea's.

I totally disagree with those negative reviews and find I like and prefer the Robert Sherman DVD over the other two.  I like his style and find that he's more like a typical spin class instructor ... versus Mindy Mylrea ... she's a bit too much for me.",1265155200,,413,4.269230769230769
2289738,1,B0009GV9QY,"Unless you have never ridden a bicycle before, this video is a complete waste of time.  It is much more motivating to watch a blank wall while you ride.  At least then, you can listen to real music, too.",1264982400,,203,4.17948717948718
2289739,5,B0009GV9QY,"Like most parents trying to balance work and taking care of kids, a workout can be pushed to the side.  This spinning video is hard work and really gets you sweating and cooled down in 40 min -- great for a nap time workout.  Much is said about Robert Sherman in these reviews.  I found that even though he's talking to me from the TV during the workout, he kept me going when I thought I might stop.  I'm off to buy his other spin video.",1263168000,,438,4.058139534883721
2289740,2,B0009GV9QY,"The routines are good, but for me is very bored, flat in music, looks like be in a classroom with a bored teacher even the content is interesting.",1249603200,,146,4.25
2289751,5,B0009GV9QY,"I recently embarked on a Couch to Sprint Triathlon training program, training for the bike portion on NYC side streets. Due to the ""days of Noah""-esque rain conditions in the city that were inhibiting my ability to consistently go outside and ride since late May, I decided to buy this video to help me stay on track with my bike training. After reading all the reviews about the video, I had mixed feelings but decided to take a chance and purchase the video anyway. I AM GLAD I DID.  FURTHERMORE, I WOULD encourage others all levels, however especially those that are beginner cyclists or spinners to purchase it as well.

I consider myself a beginner spinner, although I am not new to spinning and have taken multitudes of classes over the years.  Watching the Foundations video, I was impressed with information that was provided in terms of correct positioning of self on the spin  bike.  In the spin classes that I have taken in the past, the instructors would make sure the bike seat would be set at the right height and distance for you and that would be the tall and short of it, then the class will start pedaling away on some interval type training regimen.  However, in the Foundation Video, the instructor made a point to make the viewer also make sure the body was properly aligned and that that rider is using both legs evenly, while giving time to focus on each leg individually.  He  encouraged reducing bounce on the bike by throwing the hips back, proper rest and body alignment during rest, and proper hydration. What really impressed me, is that the video incorporates stretching on the bike before really getting into the down and dirty of the spin segment.  I learned things that I had never heard in any of the hundreds of spin classes and dozen or so instructors that I had worked out with in past.

In terms of difficulty, I could barely make it through the 45 min Foundational Video segment and have yet to try the Interval Training video segment (I want to have the Foundation part down first).  Initially, I was concerned that the video would be too basic but that is not the case AT ALL.  I think this video is good for the beginner, intermediate, and advanced fitness enthusiast looking to diversify their exercise portfolio.  In the case of the advanced spinner/cyclist this video may be more appropriate for a recovery week type short training segment.

So while there are some reviewers that may quibble over music selection or his personal style, there is enough SUBSTANCE in the video to make it a worthwhile purchase.",1249257600,23,2554,4.671875
2289752,4,B0009GV9QY,"I instruct cycling classes and wanted to gain some other or new skills especially in the way of motivating my classes. Robert Sherman is thorough with instructions re: form, intensity; as well as motivating his class. I did pick up a couple of new teaching ideas which is what I wanted. However, for advanced indoor or outdoor riders wanting to use this as a training video - there is a lot of cueing, and I personally find instructors that talk a whole bunch distracting. But because this is instructional, I get the purpose - thus ideal as refresher or for newbies.",1242604800,,567,4.623762376237623
2289753,5,B0009GV9QY,"I purchased (1) Cycle Reebok: Foundations and Interval Training with Robert Sherman, (2) Mindy Mylrea's Super Cycle: The Best Ride in Town and (3) Bike-O-Vision Cycling DVD #12 Oregon at the same time. I have been very happy with the first two, and plan on selling the Oregon DVD shortly.

Robert Sherman's DVD is very focused on building strength and skill while maintaining control. He does have the intense, almost cheesy persona that others wrote about, but I find that I really like that. It helps me stay in his game, like he's always trying to hang on to you mentally. Robert talks a lot about staying internally focused, and makes it all about you and your experience. It's meditative in a way - he asks you to close your eyes, envision your body, stuff like that. My maximum heart rate is around 180, and with his workouts, I generally find myself in the 155-165 range, reaching 175 during the last set. He gives regular opportunities to recover and stretch.

Mindy Mylrea takes a different approach. Instead of the internal focus, she is very external - you are trying to catch up with a friend, pass a professional cycler and then run from a big dog. She keeps my heart range in the 165-175, with an occasion 180+. She keeps you running for longer intervals, and gives less recovery overall. She is very upbeat and smiley. I find both Mindy and Robert offer a likeable, valuable workout. Neither has great music, but I don't find myself noticing that very much.

Finally, I don't care much for the Oregon DVD. The music is classic and instrumental, though you could mute that and listen to your own stuff. The ride is pretty, but there's no real sense of hill climbing or speed. You completely have to make it up yourself. Also, sometimes you are sort of going uphill and then you switch to a different part of the road with no clear transition. I would rather spend my time watching DVD's of TV series I like than watch this while cycling.",1239321600,6,1951,4.584527220630372
2289754,4,B0009GV9QY,"I just recently purchased this DVD. After reading the very funny review making reference to Robert Sherman being a ""Podman""...I was hesitant...but it turned out to be a good decision.

Yes...he does look very robotic..but the workout is good....and depending on how advanced u are...it can be made hard.

The only downside I found was the workouts being very similar. The foundation ride and the interval ride...its just that the interval ride is alittle more aggressive.

I did appreciate how Robert Sherman made reference to proper posture...and give alternative pacing for beginners.

Definitely worth the purchase.",1220313600,2,618,5.40625
2289755,5,B0009GV9QY,Very physiologically sound spinning tape.  Sherman makes sure that you know exactly how to do each move.  Great workout.,1219449600,,120,5.2631578947368425
2289756,5,B0009GV9QY,"This DVD will definitely give you the workout you need. But if this is your first time on a spinning bike, this is not for you.  Try the Robert Sherman Cycle Challenge instead.

Great Work Out though. Easy to follow instructions, clear speech, and good demonstrations.  The instructor works out with you to give you that extra push, and the company you need to know you're not doing this on your own.",1171065600,26,400,4.527777777777778
2289757,4,B0009GV9QY,"I was somewhat reluctant of ordering this dvd because of the earlier review of its comedic value.  However, I must say that I found Mr. Sherman sincere and I was very pleased with the workout.  I'm an experienced spinner but I had been away for awhile and wanted to get back in slowly.  I would recommend the dvd.  I think it was a good workout, albeit the music could be much more exciting to get a really great workout.",1169337600,12,421,4.291139240506329
2289758,4,B0009GV9QY,"I think this a great DVD specialy for a first time to intermediate workout level.

DVD is divided in two workouts. First part Foundation Robert Sherman leads you to understand the importance of a good posture and techniques.

Second Interval Training ride, he focuses on advanced cycling techniques

In both workouts, he provides a good warm-up and several series of intervals alternating hill type workout, speed and recovery, cool down and some stretching all according to the proper level.

Over all is a good spinning workout.",1167782400,14,530,5.127906976744186
2289759,1,B0009GV9QY,"this is a bizarre video and highly not recommended. I am still not sure if the ""host"" is actually a real human being or perhaps some sort of pod person, unfortunately for me, this is one of the dvd's to come up in a search on netflix for cycling training, there are so many bicycling movies they could have stocked other than this.",1164758400,3,331,4.26984126984127
2289760,5,B0009GV9QY,"I really don't know where to begin my chest still hurts. Let me set up the scene. Its winter time. Its snowing outside. I have my bike hooked up to the trainer. Based on the above review, I decided to pick up this DVD to add something extra to my training sessions. The disc arrives on Friday. On Sunday. I'm sitting on the couch, bored, so I pop it in to check it out.

Five minutes into the DVD I'm thinking ""What the f@*k? This is the cheesiest workout video I've seen in my entire life. I'm sending it back"". Ten minutes into it I'm laughing so hard my sides are hurting. This must be shared with the world. I make some phone calls, invite some friends over, mix some drinks, and hit play. Now everyone is laughing. My sister had to leave the room because it was too painful for her to watch.

Not only am I not sending this back, I plan to hunt down copies and give to my friends as X-Mas gifts. This is the most hysterically funny excercise video ever made. Robert Sherman is a freakin comedic genius. Imagine if the crew of Saturday Night Live was given the task of creating an excerise video. Even they could not come up with this puppy. Its just that far off the wall. Its meant to be a serious video but Sherman has no clue how utterly ridiculous he sounds. First off, he's in full makeup trying hard to suck in his cheeks. In the background theres some really bad porno movie disco music playing. He then ambushes you with these 'inspirational' one-liners that are meant to be deep but are delivered in such a robotic and clueless way that all you can do is howl, and I mean HOWL, with laughter. Keep your eye on the blonde with the shaved head and somewhat masculine features riding next to him - she almost loses it a couple of times. When you catch her smirking, do a shot.

Summary - Imagine if Christian Bale playing Patrick Bateman of 'American Psycho' decided to film himself in a Spinning class right after killing someone with a lobster fork. We're talking that level of sarcasm. Basically, its the 'Springtime for Hitler' of excercise video's.

You must own this DVD. If there ever was a cure for the winter blah's this is it. Invite friends over. Buy some snacks and break out the Tequilla. You will not be disappointed.",1133654400,41,2242,4.369304556354916
