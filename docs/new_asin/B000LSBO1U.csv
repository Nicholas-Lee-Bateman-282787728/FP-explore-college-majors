8163997,2,B000LSBO1U,"Silly me, I expected this dvd to be about vampires because of the title and cover. How wrong I was, so if you expect to see your favorite vampire, forget it, they do not exist. This is a cheat thrill silent movies dvd of women showing their wares to cheapo music.

Glori-Anne Gilbert is the narrator with Kelly Jaye in first slot. Kelly takes 22 minutes to have a shower and rub cream all over herself on the bed.

Apparently Glori gets turned on by anything, because she was so hot from this clip she had to rub an ice-cube between her ample mounds to cool off, but the next one with Lovette sent her over the moon.

Lovette strips off and plays on a sofa and shows us how to put on a bra and panties. I just hope it was as exciting for her as it wasn't for me.

After this clip Glori asks the viewer if she gave us permission to play with that. I want to know how she knew I was playing with the fast forward button.

Brittany Andrews is the last vamp, and is lounging in a sofa chair showing the best parts of herself, then strips out of a dress and shows how a banana should be eaten slowly. She also plays with a strawberry and gives the car body an oiling to the extreme.

Glori finally tries to get our minds off the contents of the dvd, and does as good as a job as the other three vamps.

I must say that I have reviewed a few of this type of dvds and I'm starting to tolerate them a bit, but the music on the silent clips are so annoying.

There is also a clip of ""The Blonde Wench Project"" about three blondes in Cininnati, Ohio, and three photo galleries that can be accessed from the menu or straight from the dvd.

I gave this dvd two stars as I deducted one star for each fault - the cover (wrong impression), the silent clips and the music. If you like this type of dvd go for it, as my review is only but one opinion.",1365638400,4,1834,4.016483516483516
