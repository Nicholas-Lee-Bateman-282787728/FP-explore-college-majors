8376117,4,B002OLT73O,"This offering from the History Channel from their ""Man, Moment & Machine"" series gives a very good overview of von Richtofens activities with the Fokker Dr1 Triplane although most of his victories were achieved with the Albatross D111 & Va.
However their reinactment of his classic dogfight with Maj. Lano Hawker is the best I have seen.
The CGI action is not too fast which is the usual fault of WW1 reinactments & the DH-2 is well presented.
Altogether this is a DVD that I will watch regularly with pleasure.",1292630400,13,511,4.688888888888889
