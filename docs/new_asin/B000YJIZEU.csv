8233050,2,B000YJIZEU,"I have viewed many massage videos over the years and I found this one to be disappointing.  The overall content or material provided was good.  Unfortunately, the directions/angles that the video was taken from were poorly chosen.  I found it rather difficult to see exactly what was being demonstrated which is one of the reasons someone purchases a video DVD instead of a book or CD.

Hopefully if another edition is produced this problem will be corrected.",1231459200,2,459,4.922077922077922
