8709537,5,B00V7ORNSU,I love this series . The films are very well made on a small budget . Very dark . Richard Dix plays a very complex character and plays it well . Very much a film noir with  shadows and odd camera angles . Highly recommended .,1435449600,,225,3.891304347826087
8709538,5,B00V7ORNSU,"So thrilled to see the Whistler films finally being released in fairly pristine copies. This is surely the creme de la creme of series films. The ageing Richard Dix is terrific in these wonderful little noir stories. Given the budgets Harry Cohn allowed them, their quality is nothing short of a miracle. Bring on all 8 of them, please!!!",1433289600,4,338,4.745762711864407
