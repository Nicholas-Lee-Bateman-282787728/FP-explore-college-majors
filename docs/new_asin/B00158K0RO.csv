3142781,4,B00158K0RO,"Elmer Bernstein's appropriately magnificent score remains a highlight of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, a John Sturges film that turned Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"" into an American western classic spawning three sequels, a belated CBS television series, and countless imitators.

The original, resurrected on Blu-Ray from MGM and Fox as part of a multi-disc series anthology, stars Yul Brynner as a gunslinger who recruits a band of six others (Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, and James Coburn among them) to help defend a small Mexican town against villain Eli Wallach and his gang of mercenaries. A bona-fide film classic, MGM's Blu-Ray edition basically offers an HD reprise of the label's 2006 Special Edition DVD, which was issued during that brief window when Sony was distributing the studio's home video product. The AVC encoded transfer looks great, offering crisp detail and strong colors, while the occasionally brittle DTS Master Audio sound offers a re-channeled mix of the film's original mono soundtrack (which is also on-hand).

Extras include the initial DVD's commentary track featuring Eli Wallach, James Coburn, and producer Walter Mirisch, plus featurettes on Elmer Bernstein's score (courtesy of comments from sage Jon Burlingame), a 45-minute retrospective documentary, trailers, and ""Lost Images"" from the movie. Curiously, neither Christopher Frayling's commentary from the 2006 DVD nor an interview with the film historian have been retained from that release, though everything else has.

The movie's three sequels are also included herein: RETURN OF THE SEVEN (the movie's actual on-screen title, even though the film is commonly known as RETURN OF THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN) was the mediocre, belated 1966 sequel with Brynner back as Chris, here defending yet another small town with a gaggle of new pals. Larry Cohen (!) scripted this follow-up, with western vet Burt Kennedy handling the action, shot on-location in Spain. Elmer's music once again graces the film, here featured in an understandably more ragged looking transfer (particularly compared to the full restoration its predecessor received) that's nevertheless satisfying in its AVC encode. The DTS Master Audio sound offers sparse stereo separation and seems to be little more than a tiny embellishment on the movie's original mono mix. The trailer is also on tap.

George Kennedy replaced Yul in 1969's GUNS OF THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, a superior western than its immediate predecessor, with veteran gunslinger Chris Adams called in to break a Mexican revolutionary out of prison. Decent action and another stirring Elmer score mark this 1969 sagebrush saga, which looks mighty fine on Blu-Ray with its pleasing AVC encoded transfer and mono-sounding DTS Master Audio soundtrack.

The series concluded with 1972's THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN RIDE!, a weak B-grade programmer that looks more like an episode of ""Bonanza"" than a big-screen western thanks to its obviously diminished budget, Hollywood backlot sets and lack of widescreen lensing. With Lee Van Cleef now in the lead, the movie feels like a ""Seven"" movie in name (and theme music) only, with only another Elmer score (performed by a notably reduced orchestra) and attractive female leads (Stefanie Powers, Mariette Hartley) making it palatable.

Predictably the AVC encoded transfer is the weakest of the lot here, the 1.85 frame lacking in high-def detail and color. The DTS Master Audio sound is a bit punchier than its immediate predecessors, and the trailer completes the release, one which ought to be essential for all western fans.",1337817600,39,3573,5.428828828828829

3142785,3,B00158K0RO,"Because of Amazon's crazy policy of merging all movie reviews, I need to tell you this is the review for the 4 movie Blu-ray set.

I noticed something rather odd about this DVD. Whenever you fast forward a still image is superimposed on the screen. This was done intentionally by the studio for some silly artistic reason.

On the plus side the DVD starts fast. No annoying commercials or previews.

Does not come with a digital copy.

I think there may be a bug in the DVD authoring. I found no way to select the comments shown in the menu system.

The movie itself is excellent, but the studio could've done a better job offer in the DVD and they should have also included a digital copy of the movie.",1296259200,,703,4.376923076923077

The original is still a great favourite of mine and is still as good now as it was when first released. The whole show: the music, the cast, the story. Unfortunately, the other three movies, forget them. Even with the master, Yul Brynner, in the lead role in the second movie, it did not compete with the original. However, the next two movies did not even compete with the second movie !! My suggestion: buy this ""Magnificent Seven"" four disc set and throw away the last three movies.  There is, and only was, one great ""Magnificent Seven"" movie, the original.  Sorry but true.",1287619200,6,662,4.554621848739496

3142789,5,B00158K0RO,"The Magnificent Seven finds its way into every serious discussion about the best classic westerns. It is easily my favorite. Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bronson and Eli Wallach, in one of his juiciest roles ever - this is the western that you watch again and again. True, it is a remake of ""The Seven Samurai,"" but it takes a backseat to no other film in its genre. Seven American gunfighters - a Dream Team, of sorts - are hired to guard a Mexican village from Banditos that return every season to take whatever crops the villagers have grown. Stellar cast, but just as magnificent is the musical score by Elmer Bernstein, who was nominated for an Academy Award.

It is unfortunate that the studio has chosen to issue an entire set of Mag 7 films as a package. The other three films - Return of the Seven, Magnificent Seven Ride! and Guns of the Magnificent Seven - don't belong in the sentence, let alone the same box. Do yourself a favor - buy the original Magnificent Seven (Blu-Ray) as a single. It deserves 5 stars by itself.",1278374400,26,1053,4.542105263157895
3142790,3,B00158K0RO,"Hi Folks,

Amazon.com is lumping all reviews together so I thought I'd clarify that I  am reviewing the BLU RAY set!

It wasn't clear if there were any NEW bonus features from the lovely 2 disc version of the first classic film or the follow ups on this set..there are not. My recommendation is that fans WAIT for a release of the first classic instead of making  the expensive  mistake I did by purchasing this set. I think I was convincing myself that in hi-def I'd like the follow up films  more...I don't and in fact the final installment still  looks washed out and almost tv movie of the week quality. The first three do look  improved in Blu-Ray but on the first classic film some flaws and grain are magnified by this  format. The bonus features look  nice in Blu-ray HD  but there isn't anything new here.

Unless you are one of the few who liked  the follow  up movies ,  a lot, I'd wait for a single disc Blue Ray version of  the classic film and save $40. This is a ploy to get suckers  like me to  jump  at a package and price  and I'm sure the first film will ultimately be available on its own. You do not gain much  by blu ray so keep your DVDs and enjoy them until that day.

UPDATE 4/07/14 ... I saw this once $60+ set for $14.99 at Target today.... truly a 5 star deal at The CURRENT price... I guess the lesson is to not buy when things come out as the price plummets!  Sort of like buying individual seasons of shows and then being screwed when the entire set comes out with bonus items for a lot less....",1274400000,159,1526,4.168384879725086

THOUGHTS: Simply stated, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN is one of the greatest, most entertaining Westerns ever made. Head & shoulders above the hundreds of other sagebrush & sixgun sagas which have galloped across movie screens over the past 90 years. TM7 is far and away the superior of the four films, mainly due to its being the first, and more closer copying its inspiration, Akira Kurosawa's legendary 1956 masterpiece, THE SEVEN SAMURAI. (If you haven't seen that film you owe it to yourself. It's one of the best motion pictures of all time, eastern or western... or Western.) And while the sequels to Mag7 are more or less transparent retreads, they still manage to entertain, though your affection for & enjoyment of them will depend on how much of a Western aficionado you are. Steely-eyed Yul Brenner clearly sets the tone for the first two films, making a magnetic leader of men... and therefore the biggest regret is that he doesn't reprise his role as ""Chris"" in the final two flicks, which would've helped solidify the legacy of the four films a little better. Even so, both George Kennedy & Lee Van Cleef are pretty good, though not in the same class as Brenner. (They could've at least both shaved their heads to keep the aesthetic of Brenner's visual mojo going. ;-)  Ya know?) The fourth film, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN RIDE, which I had never seen until getting this set, starts out feeling like a cheezy made for TV movie but actually gets better as it goes along, and features a rousing battle & satisfying ""conclusion"" to wrap things up.

THE BLU-RAYS: Each film is on its own disc here, so there's no worry about compression issues. The four films look & sound good, but I would've hoped they'd had somewhat sharper pictures than what we get. Still, they are much improved over the standard-def DVDs from years ago, so I can recommend double dipping to upgrade if you're a fan of this series, or Westerns in general. Special features included with the first entry appear to simply be ported over from the original DVD release. The other films only offer their theatrical trailers as the sole bonus content for each. Again, this bundled set is worth owning, especially for the video/audio improvements, plus the films are securely stored, separately, within a compact snapcase, minimizing the footprint in your video library shelf.",1483228800,3,2608,4.816964285714286

Nice boxset. Contains all the classical Mag Seven movies, each on a DVD in it's own single box. There are no special features like deleted scenes and such, just a comment track on the first movie.

Unfortunately, ""The Magnificent Seven"" and ""The Return of the Magnificent Seven""  (both starring Yul Brynner as lead) seem not to be digitally remastered. Even upscaling to 1080 hd doesn't do the trick, the picture is kind of pale and a bit fuzzy. The third and fourth movie (with George Kennedy and Lee van Cleef respectively) offer much better picture quality - (as most DVDs do on my BD player)

3142892,5,B00158K0RO,"THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN has become a classic for all time. This collection is a tribute to that.

GUNS OF THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN (1969) can be adequately described as the third entry out of a group of four films that may or may not be described as a ""series"" of westerns based on the concept of gallantry and redemption for the mythological and eternal ""seven"" gunmen. Its direct predecessor RETURN OF THE SEVEN was certainly a true sequel to the now legendary and classic THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. I found RETURN OF THE SEVEN to be a great complement to the original. Dark and labyrinth-like it examined and analyzed the central character Chris, the leader of the hired gunmen brilliantly portrayed by Yul Brynner, and his ability to ferret out the motivations of all the other important characters and bring each to terms with themselves.

In GUNS OF THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN we start over fresh with Chris now portrayed by George Kennedy. Physically and in a histrionic sense he bears little resemblance to the character of the first two films. As Yul Brynner commented on his character: there are only two things clean about him - his gun and his soul. And these are the two qualities that Kennedy brings to the role.

Thematically GUNS OF THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN is much closer to the original. However, its plot manages to be innovative and it contains some refreshing dialogue. Not only does it take the notion of ""seven"" gunmen seeking redemption for past transgressions but also it even touches on director Sam Peckinpah's familiar theme of the demise of a noble way of life in the face of a modern world. Our seven heroes in this film are indeed noble. Instead of protecting Mexican farmers against hordes of marauding bandits, they are now recruited to free a revolutionary leader, Quintero (Fernando Rey) from the prison fortress ""cave of the rats,"" commanded by the evil Colonel Diego (Michael Ansara). The oppressed Mexican people need their leader.

A real highlight of this film is the recruitment of the seven. After Max (Reni Santoni) witnesses Chris save Keno (Monte Markham) from the gallows in a very entertaining scene he requests his help. Chris agrees and Keno signs on first. Max also signs on ""not for the money, but because seven is your lucky number"" so he tells Chris. Next Chris recruits Cassie (Bernie Casey), the dynamite expert for ""one hundred dollars and not many laughs."" Chris and Keno next visit Levi Morgan (James Whitmore) who is now married and retired from the profession. Whitmore demonstrates just how fine an actor he is in this film playing his part with restrained wit and charm. He's brilliant. Onto a traveling sideshow Chris and Keno next meet Slater (Joe Don Baker) the one-armed gunman who wears a ragged Confederate tunic. ""I can't whip a six year old girl in a fair fight but I can blow a man's eyeballs out at a 100 yards, in a sandstorm!"" Chris finally signs on P.J. (Scott Thomas) apparently as a favor to the sick and coughing gunman who is also an expert with rifle and rope.

As all seven sit around a table playing cards Chris holds up the seven of spades and the scene cuts to the seven riding majestically across the landscape on their way to help the downtrodden to the familiar strains of Elmer Bernstein's theme. This one scene really defines what The Magnificent Seven are all about. Elmer Bernstein not only reworked quite a bit of his earlier music but he composed a good deal of original music for this film. However, `The Magnificent Seven' theme remains central to the film and goes through many brilliant interpretations. This was another highlight of this film. The producers spared no money when it came to the music and it makes a significant difference.

There is a great relationship in this film between the ex-slave (Casey) and the ex-Confederate (Joe Don Baker). They start out hating each other but in the end respect each other for what life's deck of cards has dealt them. Another interesting character is the young boy Emiliano Zapata (Tony Davis) who is temporarily orphaned while his father is held prisoner in the ""cave of the rats."" In the mean time James Whitmore adopts him. The boy asks many simple yet philosophical questions on the meaning of life, which gives the film real substance. Also there is the adversarial relationship between Chris and Colonel Diego, which grows darker as the film progresses. This is good against evil and there are no pretensions here.

This film visually looks quite different from its two predecessors. Though filmed in Spain we never see any signs of the desert as we did in RETURN OF THE SEVEN. Instead it is mostly filmed against vibrant green hills and meadows, uprooted gray rock formations and blue skies with billowing white clouds by cinematographer Antonio Macasoli. Director Paul Wendkos wanted to show us that the era of the gunman was coming to an end. The horses, not the guns fit the landscape. The claustrophobic images of gunmen gambling and drinking in smoke filled saloons and lurking in dark streets are gone. As the seven come closer to their date with destiny the landscape mirrors their final resting-place in the great beyond.

I always liked this film. It has a certain ""Saturday matinee"" quality about it that makes it very entertaining and uplifting. However, that very quality has seemed to diminish its very importance to some. All I know is that when Max (Reni Santoni) delivers the final line of this film (...the Cowards Die Many Deaths but the Brave Only One) I got a lump in my throat and a tear in my eye. Like one of the Mexican farmers in the original THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN told Steve McQueen, ""That's a feeling worth dying for.""

When THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN RIDE! was released in 1972 it became apparent that this was the end of an era. I grew up with the original THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN to the extent that it became an integral part of my youth. I greeted RETURN OF THE SEVEN, six years later with open arms and grew to endear truly endear GUNS OF THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN because it captured the spirit of the seven and embraced it. THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN RIDE! seems much less like the fourth film in a movie series but rather a half-hearted effort to turn out one more story that may have looked more effective on television than on the big screen. Yet, It has its moments and I endear those.",1379808000,3,6342,4.73731884057971
3142893,5,B00158K0RO,"""Why do you people all have such long names?""
""I don't know. Perhaps it's because we have such short lives.""

Every time someone makes a Western that makes money, be it True Grit, Dances with Wolves or Unforgiven, there's talk of the revival of the genre, but what it really needs is another Magnificent Seven to do the trick. It may not have the intellectual or philosophical weight of, or even as much action as Seven Samurai, but what the Hell, this is the Hollywood western at its most downright exciting and enjoyable, with a nice line in sly humour thrown in for good measure.

It's one of those films that hides the scars of its difficult production exceptionally well. Brynner originally intended to direct with Anthony Quinn (who had directed Quinn in The Buccaneer) in the lead and the Seven originally made up of older Civil War veterans in a darker screenplay by Walter Bernstein, but after much rewriting and an acrimonious lawsuits surprisingly came out a much stronger picture. The rewriting went on through the shoot, partially to beat an actor's strike, partially to placate the Mexican censors, with Walter Newman taking his name off the picture and sole credit going to William Roberts (the finished script is mostly Newman's work). Then there were the constant problems with Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen and Horst Buccholz all vying for attention and feuding all the way only for the studio, disappointed with the finished film, to practically dump the film in the US before giving it a second chance (and three sequels and a TV series) after it proved a huge hit in the foreign markets.

With all that going against it, it shouldn't have worked, but it does, and quite magnificently too thanks to its canny casting, strong script and, of course, Elmer Bernstein's magnificent signature score (complete with John Williams on piano!) that combine to create a great audience picture. Almost a bridge between the old school American western and the sixties vogue for gritty south of the border violence, like Seven Samurai it leaves the impression of a film that is full of movement, largely due to the kinetic action scenes as the camera races alongside men and horses.

Director John Sturges' use of the Scope frame is characteristically outstanding, filling the frame with detail and occasionally making interesting contrast between foreground stillness and background movement, as in the Seven's arrival in the village or their first confrontation with Eli Wallach's bandit chief. Wallach, in the role that inspired John Belushi's Mexican Killer Bee on Saturday Night Live among a hundred other parodies, is more than a tad over the top, brandishing lines like ""If God did not want them sheared he would not have made them sheep"" with the kind of wild abandon that Alfonso Bedoya would envy, but it works a treat. The rest of the cast are on good form with Brunner, McQueen, Backhauls, Charles Bronson and James Coburn generally getting the best opportunities (sorry Bob, sorry Brad), and their introductory set pieces - not least the ride to Boot Hill - still hold good five decades on.

Very belated sequel Return of the Seven sees Chris (before he turned into George Kennedy and Lee Van Cleef) returning to a certain Mexican village with another ragtag band of hired guns to save the locals from being kidnapped for slave labor in what is surprisingly the weakest of the sequels despite having the biggest budget and best production values of any of the followups. If the village looks different, that's because it's moved to Spain to take advantage of the more amenable local censors and exchange rate, and it's not the only thing to have had a facelift since the original. Even though Steve McQueen and Horst Buccholz's characters return, sole returning cast member Yul Brynner ensured they didn't (Robert Fuller and Julian Mateos take their place) and seems to have done his damnedest to ensure none of the supporting players will outshine him: those looking for future stars will have to settle for Warren Oates and Claude Akins. You get the feeling that if Brynner had had his way the film would have been called The Return of the Magnificent Chris: none of the rest of the Seven are allowed much character or any memorable scenes. He even dismisses them as just being there for a fight - ""If not this one, they'd find another"" - but in reality their sole purpose is to tell him how great he is. You almost expect Fernando Rey's priest to ask ""Are you God?"" Everyone is in his giant shadow and nobody is going to steal his spotlight this time.

Burt Kennedy's direction has its moments but is mostly solid rather than dynamic and the plotting mostly mundane even though the villain actually has an interesting motive to drive the story. Even recruiting the Seven (actually six since one of them is held prisoner) fails to throw up any memorable set pieces in a film that's light on action and incident until the two big battle scenes, rendering it at times one of those disappointing films that is more interesting for what its cast and crew would go on to do than what they actually do here. Writer Larry Cohen would go on to create The Invaders and direct a string of out-of-leftfield genre films; producer Ted Richmond, one of the pioneers of filming Hollywood pictures in Spain (here shooting in the studios of the practice's most discredited proponent, Samuel Bronston) would go on to make the bonkers cowboys and samurai Western Red Sun and team up again with Brynner on the Sam Peckinpah-Robert Towne scripted Villa Rides; while villain Emilio Fernandez and Warren Oates would face off again two years later in The Wild Bunch. All of which were more memorable than this drawn out and less than action-packed number that's best approached with low expectations and an undemanding mood.

Guns of the Magnificent Seven is set shortly after a negotiating accident left Yul Brynner looking like George Kennedy, and it's not just the star who's changed: not only does he have hair but he's given up on the all-black outfits and the staccato moralising. It's lower-budgeted but considerably better directed than Return, moving into spaghetti western territory as he gets involved in a Mexican revolution when Reni Santoni asks his help to spring Fernado Rey's politician from local sadist Michael Ansara's fortress. Naturally he goes looking for a few good men to help him out - ""Not enough to get noticed, just enough to get the job done"" - and thankfully they're a more interesting bunch this time round than in the previous sequel. Better still, without Yul Brynner's ego hogging the spotlight they're all given proper introductions and motivations to make it more of an ensemble piece, and there are more familiar faces in the cast this time, with Monte Markham's horse thief, Joe Don Baker's bitter one-armed Confederate sharpshooter `Buffalo Ben' (""I can't whip a six-year-old girl in a fair fight, but I can blow a man's eyeballs out at a hundred yards in a sandstorm.""), Bernie Casey's explosives expert, James Whitmore's ageing knifeman and Scott Thomas' dying gunman making up his lucky number.

This time round they can't quite manage the job on their own and have to rely on a distinctly unreliable bandit to swell their numbers, allowing for a bit of under-developed tension in the ranks, as does Joe Don Baker and Bernie Casey's racially-challenged adversarial friendship subplot that would later be very obviously reworked by Hardy Kruger and Winston Ntshona in The Wild Geese, itself very obviously inspired by the original Magnificent Seven. The script's sharper than you might expect, with good dialogue and some memorable little moments like Kennedy getting his information about the garrison's strength from a casual conversation about women with one of the guards, and it benefits greatly from a strong villain who is given a memorable mass execution scene. Director Paul Wendkos has an excellent eye for the Scope format, and though it's not the most action packed of the series it makes its mark and keeps things interesting while you're waiting for it, setting it out as easily the best of the sequels

Final big-screen outing The Magnificent Seven Ride sees Chris, who now looks like Lee Van Cleef, settled down as a small-town sheriff with his own would-be Ned Buntline dime novel biographer in tow until an act of mercy results in the death of his wife and sends him on a manhunt below the border where he finds another village in need of seven good men. The village is one that Ralph Waite, one of an earlier Seven (evidently Chris made more trips below the border than they filmed), tried to recruit our hero to defend only to be turned down, but it's not so much guilt that drives him to go recruiting hardened convicts in the local prison to defend the raped womenfolk from the returning bandits after their men folk are all killed. Having ruthlessly disposed of his partners in crime (""Him for what he did. You for what you didn't do""), Chris is pretty much just using them as bait for the remaining one of his wife's killers who is riding with the bandits...

The plot certainly takes the scenic route, the first half a revenge Western, the second a men on a mission picture, a sort of The Dirty Dozen Meets Guns of Fort Petticoat. The segue is handled neatly enough, but the film never rises above the average. The biggest problem is that despite, or perhaps because of being played by two actors (Rodolfo Acosta and stuntman Ron Stein) we never see the villain until the final battle, simply the dead bodies he leaves in his wake. No confrontations, no banter, no sense of who he is or why he's a threat, just a guy on a horse. (The best exchange is with a priest who only has one scene: ""God works in strange ways."" ""Yeah, I know. He's got me confused most of the time too."") The new recruits to the side of the angels don't fare that much better despite their employer coming up with neat way of ensuring the loyalty of men who want to kill him. Ed Lauter as usual does a lot with very little, but only James B. Sikking really makes an impression, leaving most of them fairly bland cannon fodder. Chris makes few bones about regarding them as such either: the film's best scene has them discussing strategy and predicting losses on both sides, and for once the strategy actually makes sense - this is planned out as a battle, not a gunfight. When it comes it's a decent enough showdown for a B-movie but nothing to stick in the memory for long.

Which goes for the film as a whole. George McCowan's direction is efficient but uninspired, the film's use of backlot sets and overused locations giving it the look of a 70s TV show, something not shooting in Scope but a more TV-friendly 1.85:1 only emphasises. Even Elmer Bernstein's score, at times more in the style of an episode of The High Chaparral rather than his iconic original, sounds like he could only round up seven less than magnificent musicians from some dead-end border town to play it. Still, if you're in an undemanding mood it's an okay outing even if it falls far short of being a grand finale to the series.

Released twice in two special editions on DVD, the DVD boxed set of all four films includes an audio commentary by James Coburn, Eli Wallach, Walter Mirisch and Robert E. Relyea, 45-minute documentary Guns For Hire (slightly abridged from the longer version that showed on Channel 4), stills galleries, two theatrical trailers and trailers for the three sequels on the first film. (A subsequent two-disc release added an audio commentary and featurette with film historian Christopher Frayling and a featurette on Elmer Bernstein's score.) Unfortunately the UK DVD releases dropped the original mono soundtrack option on the first film in favour of a remastered stereo score that didn't do Bernstein's score any favours, particularly in the main title sequence, though both stereo and mono options were on the US DVD and Blu-ray releases.

The US Blu-ray set of all four films is thankfully region free and well worth picking up despite losing some of the extras from the first film - most notably Frayling's contributions - while the sequels are limited to remastered trailers in the correct ratio (these were crudely cropped in the UK boxed set) but sadly losing such gems of hyperbolic narration as ""Seven men to free a nation of peasants from an army of madmen!"" on the Guns of the Magnificent Seven trailer.

Unlike the Dollars films there's been no excessive use of Dolby Noise Reduction, avoiding the unnatural waxwork look that plagued that Blu-ray set. The transfer for Return of the Seven is for the most part decent, though has better detail on the studio-shot scenes than some of the big outdoor stuff, and unlike the UK DVD and TV prints bears the original title, Return of the Seven rather than Return of the Magnificent Seven. Annoyingly every time you pause you get a menu picture over the picture while any time you use the subtitles another menu box also appears in the corner of the screen to inform you you've selected subtitles, both taking too long to disappear, but the discs do have excellent playback memory even if you remove the discs. Despite these niggles, it's often found going fairly cheap at Amazon.com, making the US Blu-ray the best presentation around.",1374883200,21,13329,4.807239424334933
3142894,4,B00158K0RO,"Okay, first off 'The Magnificent Seven' is one of the best westerns (hell, one of the best adventure films) ever made--and you probably already have a copy in some sort of format.  Why buy this set, then?

Clearly, you buy this to get the sequels!  Return of the Seven retains Yul Brynner as 'Chris', master gunfighter and leader.  Robert Fuller takes over the Steve McQueen 'Vin' role and doesn't do as much with it.  However, as this film also has Claude Akins and Warren Oates, it works just fine.

'Guns of the Magnificent Seven' is the least of the films.  George Kennedy is a rather listless 'Chris' and even the great James Whitmore cannot save the film.

'The Magnificent Seven Ride' surprised me.  Lee Van Cleef as an older, tired Chris is just fine and the rest of the cast--looking like the members of a TV movie--help things move along.  A fine turn by Stephanie Power helps.

Same story pretty much with a few little changes, so don't expect anything great.  The blu-ray transfer for the movies was very good, though and that made me happy and seeing the original movie again was a must for my collection.

3377278,4,B00158K0RO,"Elmer Bernstein's appropriately magnificent score remains a highlight of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, a John Sturges film that turned Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"" into an American western classic spawning three sequels, a belated CBS television series, and countless imitators.

The original, resurrected on Blu-Ray from MGM and Fox as part of a multi-disc series anthology, stars Yul Brynner as a gunslinger who recruits a band of six others (Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, and James Coburn among them) to help defend a small Mexican town against villain Eli Wallach and his gang of mercenaries. A bona-fide film classic, MGM's Blu-Ray edition basically offers an HD reprise of the label's 2006 Special Edition DVD, which was issued during that brief window when Sony was distributing the studio's home video product. The AVC encoded transfer looks great, offering crisp detail and strong colors, while the occasionally brittle DTS Master Audio sound offers a re-channeled mix of the film's original mono soundtrack (which is also on-hand).

Extras include the initial DVD's commentary track featuring Eli Wallach, James Coburn, and producer Walter Mirisch, plus featurettes on Elmer Bernstein's score (courtesy of comments from sage Jon Burlingame), a 45-minute retrospective documentary, trailers, and ""Lost Images"" from the movie. Curiously, neither Christopher Frayling's commentary from the 2006 DVD nor an interview with the film historian have been retained from that release, though everything else has.

The movie's three sequels are also included herein: RETURN OF THE SEVEN (the movie's actual on-screen title, even though the film is commonly known as RETURN OF THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN) was the mediocre, belated 1966 sequel with Brynner back as Chris, here defending yet another small town with a gaggle of new pals. Larry Cohen (!) scripted this follow-up, with western vet Burt Kennedy handling the action, shot on-location in Spain. Elmer's music once again graces the film, here featured in an understandably more ragged looking transfer (particularly compared to the full restoration its predecessor received) that's nevertheless satisfying in its AVC encode. The DTS Master Audio sound offers sparse stereo separation and seems to be little more than a tiny embellishment on the movie's original mono mix. The trailer is also on tap.

George Kennedy replaced Yul in 1969's GUNS OF THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, a superior western than its immediate predecessor, with veteran gunslinger Chris Adams called in to break a Mexican revolutionary out of prison. Decent action and another stirring Elmer score mark this 1969 sagebrush saga, which looks mighty fine on Blu-Ray with its pleasing AVC encoded transfer and mono-sounding DTS Master Audio soundtrack.

The series concluded with 1972's THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN RIDE!, a weak B-grade programmer that looks more like an episode of ""Bonanza"" than a big-screen western thanks to its obviously diminished budget, Hollywood backlot sets and lack of widescreen lensing. With Lee Van Cleef now in the lead, the movie feels like a ""Seven"" movie in name (and theme music) only, with only another Elmer score (performed by a notably reduced orchestra) and attractive female leads (Stefanie Powers, Mariette Hartley) making it palatable.

Predictably the AVC encoded transfer is the weakest of the lot here, the 1.85 frame lacking in high-def detail and color. The DTS Master Audio sound is a bit punchier than its immediate predecessors, and the trailer completes the release, one which ought to be essential for all western fans.",1337817600,39,3573,5.428828828828829

I noticed something rather odd about this DVD. Whenever you fast forward a still image is superimposed on the screen. This was done intentionally by the studio for some silly artistic reason.

On the plus side the DVD starts fast. No annoying commercials or previews.

Does not come with a digital copy.

I think there may be a bug in the DVD authoring. I found no way to select the comments shown in the menu system.

The movie itself is excellent, but the studio could've done a better job offer in the DVD and they should have also included a digital copy of the movie.",1296259200,,703,4.376923076923077

Unfortunately, the other three movies, forget them. Even with the master, Yul Brynner, in the lead role in the second movie, it did not compete with the original. However, the next two movies did not even compete with the second movie !! My suggestion: buy this ""Magnificent Seven"" four disc set and throw away the last three movies.

3377286,5,B00158K0RO,"The Magnificent Seven finds its way into every serious discussion about the best classic westerns. It is easily my favorite. Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bronson and Eli Wallach, in one of his juiciest roles ever - this is the western that you watch again and again. True, it is a remake of ""The Seven Samurai,"" but it takes a backseat to no other film in its genre. Seven American gunfighters - a Dream Team, of sorts - are hired to guard a Mexican village from Banditos that return every season to take whatever crops the villagers have grown. Stellar cast, but just as magnificent is the musical score by Elmer Bernstein, who was nominated for an Academy Award.

It is unfortunate that the studio has chosen to issue an entire set of Mag 7 films as a package. The other three films - Return of the Seven, Magnificent Seven Ride! and Guns of the Magnificent Seven - don't belong in the sentence, let alone the same box. Do yourself a favor - buy the original Magnificent Seven (Blu-Ray) as a single. It deserves 5 stars by itself.",1278374400,26,1053,4.542105263157895
3377287,3,B00158K0RO,"Hi Folks,

Amazon.com is lumping all reviews together so I thought I'd clarify that I  am reviewing the BLU RAY set!

It wasn't clear if there were any NEW bonus features from the lovely 2 disc version of the first classic film or the follow ups on this set..there are not. My recommendation is that fans WAIT for a release of the first classic instead of making  the expensive  mistake I did by purchasing this set. I think I was convincing myself that in hi-def I'd like the follow up films  more...I don't and in fact the final installment still  looks washed out and almost tv movie of the week quality. The first three do look  improved in Blu-Ray but on the first classic film some flaws and grain are magnified by this  format. The bonus features look  nice in Blu-ray HD  but there isn't anything new here.

Unless you are one of the few who liked  the follow  up movies ,  a lot, I'd wait for a single disc Blue Ray version of  the classic film and save $40. This is a ploy to get suckers  like me to  jump  at a package and price  and I'm sure the first film will ultimately be available on its own. You do not gain much  by blu ray so keep your DVDs and enjoy them until that day.

UPDATE 4/07/14 ... I saw this once $60+ set for $14.99 at Target today.... truly a 5 star deal at The CURRENT price... I guess the lesson is to not buy when things come out as the price plummets!  Sort of like buying individual seasons of shows and then being screwed when the entire set comes out with bonus items for a lot less....",1274400000,159,1526,4.168384879725086

THOUGHTS: Simply stated, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN is one of the greatest, most entertaining Westerns ever made. Head & shoulders above the hundreds of other sagebrush & sixgun sagas which have galloped across movie screens over the past 90 years. TM7 is far and away the superior of the four films, mainly due to its being the first, and more closer copying its inspiration, Akira Kurosawa's legendary 1956 masterpiece, THE SEVEN SAMURAI. (If you haven't seen that film you owe it to yourself. It's one of the best motion pictures of all time, eastern or western... or Western.) And while the sequels to Mag7 are more or less transparent retreads, they still manage to entertain, though your affection for & enjoyment of them will depend on how much of a Western aficionado you are. Steely-eyed Yul Brenner clearly sets the tone for the first two films, making a magnetic leader of men... and therefore the biggest regret is that he doesn't reprise his role as ""Chris"" in the final two flicks, which would've helped solidify the legacy of the four films a little better. Even so, both George Kennedy & Lee Van Cleef are pretty good, though not in the same class as Brenner. (They could've at least both shaved their heads to keep the aesthetic of Brenner's visual mojo going. ;-)  Ya know?) The fourth film, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN RIDE, which I had never seen until getting this set, starts out feeling like a cheezy made for TV movie but actually gets better as it goes along, and features a rousing battle & satisfying ""conclusion"" to wrap things up.

THE BLU-RAYS: Each film is on its own disc here, so there's no worry about compression issues. The four films look & sound good, but I would've hoped they'd had somewhat sharper pictures than what we get. Still, they are much improved over the standard-def DVDs from years ago, so I can recommend double dipping to upgrade if you're a fan of this series, or Westerns in general. Special features included with the first entry appear to simply be ported over from the original DVD release. The other films only offer their theatrical trailers as the sole bonus content for each. Again, this bundled set is worth owning, especially for the video/audio improvements, plus the films are securely stored, separately, within a compact snapcase, minimizing the footprint in your video library shelf.",1483228800,3,2608,4.816964285714286

Nice boxset. Contains all the classical Mag Seven movies, each on a DVD in it's own single box. There are no special features like deleted scenes and such, just a comment track on the first movie.

Unfortunately, ""The Magnificent Seven"" and ""The Return of the Magnificent Seven""  (both starring Yul Brynner as lead) seem not to be digitally remastered. Even upscaling to 1080 hd doesn't do the trick, the picture is kind of pale and a bit fuzzy. The third and fourth movie (with George Kennedy and Lee van Cleef respectively) offer much better picture quality - (as most DVDs do on my BD player)

3377389,5,B00158K0RO,"THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN has become a classic for all time. This collection is a tribute to that.

GUNS OF THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN (1969) can be adequately described as the third entry out of a group of four films that may or may not be described as a ""series"" of westerns based on the concept of gallantry and redemption for the mythological and eternal ""seven"" gunmen. Its direct predecessor RETURN OF THE SEVEN was certainly a true sequel to the now legendary and classic THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. I found RETURN OF THE SEVEN to be a great complement to the original. Dark and labyrinth-like it examined and analyzed the central character Chris, the leader of the hired gunmen brilliantly portrayed by Yul Brynner, and his ability to ferret out the motivations of all the other important characters and bring each to terms with themselves.

In GUNS OF THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN we start over fresh with Chris now portrayed by George Kennedy. Physically and in a histrionic sense he bears little resemblance to the character of the first two films. As Yul Brynner commented on his character: there are only two things clean about him - his gun and his soul. And these are the two qualities that Kennedy brings to the role.

Thematically GUNS OF THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN is much closer to the original. However, its plot manages to be innovative and it contains some refreshing dialogue. Not only does it take the notion of ""seven"" gunmen seeking redemption for past transgressions but also it even touches on director Sam Peckinpah's familiar theme of the demise of a noble way of life in the face of a modern world. Our seven heroes in this film are indeed noble. Instead of protecting Mexican farmers against hordes of marauding bandits, they are now recruited to free a revolutionary leader, Quintero (Fernando Rey) from the prison fortress ""cave of the rats,"" commanded by the evil Colonel Diego (Michael Ansara). The oppressed Mexican people need their leader.

A real highlight of this film is the recruitment of the seven. After Max (Reni Santoni) witnesses Chris save Keno (Monte Markham) from the gallows in a very entertaining scene he requests his help. Chris agrees and Keno signs on first. Max also signs on ""not for the money, but because seven is your lucky number"" so he tells Chris. Next Chris recruits Cassie (Bernie Casey), the dynamite expert for ""one hundred dollars and not many laughs."" Chris and Keno next visit Levi Morgan (James Whitmore) who is now married and retired from the profession. Whitmore demonstrates just how fine an actor he is in this film playing his part with restrained wit and charm. He's brilliant. Onto a traveling sideshow Chris and Keno next meet Slater (Joe Don Baker) the one-armed gunman who wears a ragged Confederate tunic. ""I can't whip a six year old girl in a fair fight but I can blow a man's eyeballs out at a 100 yards, in a sandstorm!"" Chris finally signs on P.J. (Scott Thomas) apparently as a favor to the sick and coughing gunman who is also an expert with rifle and rope.

As all seven sit around a table playing cards Chris holds up the seven of spades and the scene cuts to the seven riding majestically across the landscape on their way to help the downtrodden to the familiar strains of Elmer Bernstein's theme. This one scene really defines what The Magnificent Seven are all about. Elmer Bernstein not only reworked quite a bit of his earlier music but he composed a good deal of original music for this film. However, `The Magnificent Seven' theme remains central to the film and goes through many brilliant interpretations. This was another highlight of this film. The producers spared no money when it came to the music and it makes a significant difference.

There is a great relationship in this film between the ex-slave (Casey) and the ex-Confederate (Joe Don Baker). They start out hating each other but in the end respect each other for what life's deck of cards has dealt them. Another interesting character is the young boy Emiliano Zapata (Tony Davis) who is temporarily orphaned while his father is held prisoner in the ""cave of the rats."" In the mean time James Whitmore adopts him. The boy asks many simple yet philosophical questions on the meaning of life, which gives the film real substance. Also there is the adversarial relationship between Chris and Colonel Diego, which grows darker as the film progresses. This is good against evil and there are no pretensions here.

This film visually looks quite different from its two predecessors. Though filmed in Spain we never see any signs of the desert as we did in RETURN OF THE SEVEN. Instead it is mostly filmed against vibrant green hills and meadows, uprooted gray rock formations and blue skies with billowing white clouds by cinematographer Antonio Macasoli. Director Paul Wendkos wanted to show us that the era of the gunman was coming to an end. The horses, not the guns fit the landscape. The claustrophobic images of gunmen gambling and drinking in smoke filled saloons and lurking in dark streets are gone. As the seven come closer to their date with destiny the landscape mirrors their final resting-place in the great beyond.

I always liked this film. It has a certain ""Saturday matinee"" quality about it that makes it very entertaining and uplifting. However, that very quality has seemed to diminish its very importance to some. All I know is that when Max (Reni Santoni) delivers the final line of this film (...the Cowards Die Many Deaths but the Brave Only One) I got a lump in my throat and a tear in my eye. Like one of the Mexican farmers in the original THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN told Steve McQueen, ""That's a feeling worth dying for.""

When THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN RIDE! was released in 1972 it became apparent that this was the end of an era. I grew up with the original THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN to the extent that it became an integral part of my youth. I greeted RETURN OF THE SEVEN, six years later with open arms and grew to endear truly endear GUNS OF THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN because it captured the spirit of the seven and embraced it. THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN RIDE! seems much less like the fourth film in a movie series but rather a half-hearted effort to turn out one more story that may have looked more effective on television than on the big screen. Yet, It has its moments and I endear those.",1379808000,3,6342,4.73731884057971
3377390,5,B00158K0RO,"""Why do you people all have such long names?""
""I don't know. Perhaps it's because we have such short lives.""

Every time someone makes a Western that makes money, be it True Grit, Dances with Wolves or Unforgiven, there's talk of the revival of the genre, but what it really needs is another Magnificent Seven to do the trick. It may not have the intellectual or philosophical weight of, or even as much action as Seven Samurai, but what the Hell, this is the Hollywood western at its most downright exciting and enjoyable, with a nice line in sly humour thrown in for good measure.

It's one of those films that hides the scars of its difficult production exceptionally well. Brynner originally intended to direct with Anthony Quinn (who had directed Quinn in The Buccaneer) in the lead and the Seven originally made up of older Civil War veterans in a darker screenplay by Walter Bernstein, but after much rewriting and an acrimonious lawsuits surprisingly came out a much stronger picture. The rewriting went on through the shoot, partially to beat an actor's strike, partially to placate the Mexican censors, with Walter Newman taking his name off the picture and sole credit going to William Roberts (the finished script is mostly Newman's work). Then there were the constant problems with Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen and Horst Buccholz all vying for attention and feuding all the way only for the studio, disappointed with the finished film, to practically dump the film in the US before giving it a second chance (and three sequels and a TV series) after it proved a huge hit in the foreign markets.

With all that going against it, it shouldn't have worked, but it does, and quite magnificently too thanks to its canny casting, strong script and, of course, Elmer Bernstein's magnificent signature score (complete with John Williams on piano!) that combine to create a great audience picture. Almost a bridge between the old school American western and the sixties vogue for gritty south of the border violence, like Seven Samurai it leaves the impression of a film that is full of movement, largely due to the kinetic action scenes as the camera races alongside men and horses.

Director John Sturges' use of the Scope frame is characteristically outstanding, filling the frame with detail and occasionally making interesting contrast between foreground stillness and background movement, as in the Seven's arrival in the village or their first confrontation with Eli Wallach's bandit chief. Wallach, in the role that inspired John Belushi's Mexican Killer Bee on Saturday Night Live among a hundred other parodies, is more than a tad over the top, brandishing lines like ""If God did not want them sheared he would not have made them sheep"" with the kind of wild abandon that Alfonso Bedoya would envy, but it works a treat. The rest of the cast are on good form with Brunner, McQueen, Backhauls, Charles Bronson and James Coburn generally getting the best opportunities (sorry Bob, sorry Brad), and their introductory set pieces - not least the ride to Boot Hill - still hold good five decades on.

Very belated sequel Return of the Seven sees Chris (before he turned into George Kennedy and Lee Van Cleef) returning to a certain Mexican village with another ragtag band of hired guns to save the locals from being kidnapped for slave labor in what is surprisingly the weakest of the sequels despite having the biggest budget and best production values of any of the followups. If the village looks different, that's because it's moved to Spain to take advantage of the more amenable local censors and exchange rate, and it's not the only thing to have had a facelift since the original. Even though Steve McQueen and Horst Buccholz's characters return, sole returning cast member Yul Brynner ensured they didn't (Robert Fuller and Julian Mateos take their place) and seems to have done his damnedest to ensure none of the supporting players will outshine him: those looking for future stars will have to settle for Warren Oates and Claude Akins. You get the feeling that if Brynner had had his way the film would have been called The Return of the Magnificent Chris: none of the rest of the Seven are allowed much character or any memorable scenes. He even dismisses them as just being there for a fight - ""If not this one, they'd find another"" - but in reality their sole purpose is to tell him how great he is. You almost expect Fernando Rey's priest to ask ""Are you God?"" Everyone is in his giant shadow and nobody is going to steal his spotlight this time.

Burt Kennedy's direction has its moments but is mostly solid rather than dynamic and the plotting mostly mundane even though the villain actually has an interesting motive to drive the story. Even recruiting the Seven (actually six since one of them is held prisoner) fails to throw up any memorable set pieces in a film that's light on action and incident until the two big battle scenes, rendering it at times one of those disappointing films that is more interesting for what its cast and crew would go on to do than what they actually do here. Writer Larry Cohen would go on to create The Invaders and direct a string of out-of-leftfield genre films; producer Ted Richmond, one of the pioneers of filming Hollywood pictures in Spain (here shooting in the studios of the practice's most discredited proponent, Samuel Bronston) would go on to make the bonkers cowboys and samurai Western Red Sun and team up again with Brynner on the Sam Peckinpah-Robert Towne scripted Villa Rides; while villain Emilio Fernandez and Warren Oates would face off again two years later in The Wild Bunch. All of which were more memorable than this drawn out and less than action-packed number that's best approached with low expectations and an undemanding mood.

Guns of the Magnificent Seven is set shortly after a negotiating accident left Yul Brynner looking like George Kennedy, and it's not just the star who's changed: not only does he have hair but he's given up on the all-black outfits and the staccato moralising. It's lower-budgeted but considerably better directed than Return, moving into spaghetti western territory as he gets involved in a Mexican revolution when Reni Santoni asks his help to spring Fernado Rey's politician from local sadist Michael Ansara's fortress. Naturally he goes looking for a few good men to help him out - ""Not enough to get noticed, just enough to get the job done"" - and thankfully they're a more interesting bunch this time round than in the previous sequel. Better still, without Yul Brynner's ego hogging the spotlight they're all given proper introductions and motivations to make it more of an ensemble piece, and there are more familiar faces in the cast this time, with Monte Markham's horse thief, Joe Don Baker's bitter one-armed Confederate sharpshooter `Buffalo Ben' (""I can't whip a six-year-old girl in a fair fight, but I can blow a man's eyeballs out at a hundred yards in a sandstorm.""), Bernie Casey's explosives expert, James Whitmore's ageing knifeman and Scott Thomas' dying gunman making up his lucky number.

This time round they can't quite manage the job on their own and have to rely on a distinctly unreliable bandit to swell their numbers, allowing for a bit of under-developed tension in the ranks, as does Joe Don Baker and Bernie Casey's racially-challenged adversarial friendship subplot that would later be very obviously reworked by Hardy Kruger and Winston Ntshona in The Wild Geese, itself very obviously inspired by the original Magnificent Seven. The script's sharper than you might expect, with good dialogue and some memorable little moments like Kennedy getting his information about the garrison's strength from a casual conversation about women with one of the guards, and it benefits greatly from a strong villain who is given a memorable mass execution scene. Director Paul Wendkos has an excellent eye for the Scope format, and though it's not the most action packed of the series it makes its mark and keeps things interesting while you're waiting for it, setting it out as easily the best of the sequels

Final big-screen outing The Magnificent Seven Ride sees Chris, who now looks like Lee Van Cleef, settled down as a small-town sheriff with his own would-be Ned Buntline dime novel biographer in tow until an act of mercy results in the death of his wife and sends him on a manhunt below the border where he finds another village in need of seven good men. The village is one that Ralph Waite, one of an earlier Seven (evidently Chris made more trips below the border than they filmed), tried to recruit our hero to defend only to be turned down, but it's not so much guilt that drives him to go recruiting hardened convicts in the local prison to defend the raped womenfolk from the returning bandits after their men folk are all killed. Having ruthlessly disposed of his partners in crime (""Him for what he did. You for what you didn't do""), Chris is pretty much just using them as bait for the remaining one of his wife's killers who is riding with the bandits...

The plot certainly takes the scenic route, the first half a revenge Western, the second a men on a mission picture, a sort of The Dirty Dozen Meets Guns of Fort Petticoat. The segue is handled neatly enough, but the film never rises above the average. The biggest problem is that despite, or perhaps because of being played by two actors (Rodolfo Acosta and stuntman Ron Stein) we never see the villain until the final battle, simply the dead bodies he leaves in his wake. No confrontations, no banter, no sense of who he is or why he's a threat, just a guy on a horse. (The best exchange is with a priest who only has one scene: ""God works in strange ways."" ""Yeah, I know. He's got me confused most of the time too."") The new recruits to the side of the angels don't fare that much better despite their employer coming up with neat way of ensuring the loyalty of men who want to kill him. Ed Lauter as usual does a lot with very little, but only James B. Sikking really makes an impression, leaving most of them fairly bland cannon fodder. Chris makes few bones about regarding them as such either: the film's best scene has them discussing strategy and predicting losses on both sides, and for once the strategy actually makes sense - this is planned out as a battle, not a gunfight. When it comes it's a decent enough showdown for a B-movie but nothing to stick in the memory for long.

Which goes for the film as a whole. George McCowan's direction is efficient but uninspired, the film's use of backlot sets and overused locations giving it the look of a 70s TV show, something not shooting in Scope but a more TV-friendly 1.85:1 only emphasises. Even Elmer Bernstein's score, at times more in the style of an episode of The High Chaparral rather than his iconic original, sounds like he could only round up seven less than magnificent musicians from some dead-end border town to play it. Still, if you're in an undemanding mood it's an okay outing even if it falls far short of being a grand finale to the series.

Released twice in two special editions on DVD, the DVD boxed set of all four films includes an audio commentary by James Coburn, Eli Wallach, Walter Mirisch and Robert E. Relyea, 45-minute documentary Guns For Hire (slightly abridged from the longer version that showed on Channel 4), stills galleries, two theatrical trailers and trailers for the three sequels on the first film. (A subsequent two-disc release added an audio commentary and featurette with film historian Christopher Frayling and a featurette on Elmer Bernstein's score.) Unfortunately the UK DVD releases dropped the original mono soundtrack option on the first film in favour of a remastered stereo score that didn't do Bernstein's score any favours, particularly in the main title sequence, though both stereo and mono options were on the US DVD and Blu-ray releases.

The US Blu-ray set of all four films is thankfully region free and well worth picking up despite losing some of the extras from the first film - most notably Frayling's contributions - while the sequels are limited to remastered trailers in the correct ratio (these were crudely cropped in the UK boxed set) but sadly losing such gems of hyperbolic narration as ""Seven men to free a nation of peasants from an army of madmen!"" on the Guns of the Magnificent Seven trailer.

Unlike the Dollars films there's been no excessive use of Dolby Noise Reduction, avoiding the unnatural waxwork look that plagued that Blu-ray set. The transfer for Return of the Seven is for the most part decent, though has better detail on the studio-shot scenes than some of the big outdoor stuff, and unlike the UK DVD and TV prints bears the original title, Return of the Seven rather than Return of the Magnificent Seven. Annoyingly every time you pause you get a menu picture over the picture while any time you use the subtitles another menu box also appears in the corner of the screen to inform you you've selected subtitles, both taking too long to disappear, but the discs do have excellent playback memory even if you remove the discs. Despite these niggles, it's often found going fairly cheap at Amazon.com, making the US Blu-ray the best presentation around.",1374883200,21,13329,4.807239424334933
3377391,4,B00158K0RO,"Okay, first off 'The Magnificent Seven' is one of the best westerns (hell, one of the best adventure films) ever made--and you probably already have a copy in some sort of format.  Why buy this set, then?

Clearly, you buy this to get the sequels!  Return of the Seven retains Yul Brynner as 'Chris', master gunfighter and leader.  Robert Fuller takes over the Steve McQueen 'Vin' role and doesn't do as much with it.  However, as this film also has Claude Akins and Warren Oates, it works just fine.

'Guns of the Magnificent Seven' is the least of the films.  George Kennedy is a rather listless 'Chris' and even the great James Whitmore cannot save the film.

'The Magnificent Seven Ride' surprised me.  Lee Van Cleef as an older, tired Chris is just fine and the rest of the cast--looking like the members of a TV movie--help things move along.  A fine turn by Stephanie Power helps.

I honestly just bought it for the original movie as I loved it as a child, as I liked all the 'old' westerns (including Clint's 'Man with No Name' Trilogy and pretty much all of the 'Duke's' movies), so I wasn't expecting a lot of the follow-up movies and I was happy I wasn't expecting a lot!  Same story pretty much with a few little changes, so don't expect anything great.  The blu-ray transfer for the movies was very good, though and that made me happy and seeing the original movie again was a must for my collection.
