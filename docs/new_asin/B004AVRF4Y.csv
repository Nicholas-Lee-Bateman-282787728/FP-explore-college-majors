8421017,5,B004AVRF4Y,"MAFIA is one of those movies that shows us how strong one must be in order to survive in a world of corruption, greed and power. Dharmendra like always gives his best performances as an army soldier who must wage a war against the mafia who killed one of his brothers in the line of duty. He will have to take the law in his own hands and bring the corrupt system down to it's knees. This movie is worth buying and I give it a TWO THUMBS UP.",1329609600,,441,3.966292134831461
