I watched lots of Drama series all my life but nothing's coming close to this show. The reason for that might be the fact that every episode of the TV show is based on a true filipino story. And because those stories reflect life itself they really touch the soul and heart of the viewer.

The ""US Visa"" episode is awesome thanks to the great acting of the lovely Ruffa Mae Quinto. Getting an visa is really hard these days and this film (and other Maalaala Mo Kaya episodes which need to be released on DVD soon ) shows a lot of those problems dealing with it.

Another gem is the episode called ""TV"". Kathleen Hermosa's portrayal of an young filipina who longs to own an tv set is absolutely heartbreaking. I wonder why Kathleen's not getting any main roles in filipino movies cos this episode shows she's an great actress.

And ""Banyo"" scared the hell out of me. This extraodinary episode manages to be a real-life rape story and horror movie at the same time. Marvelous!

""Peanut Butter"" is about an boy who falls in love with his english teacher. Candy Pangilinan and John Lloyd Cruz are amazing in this episode.

I recommend Maalaala Mo Kaya to anyone who loves great Drama.

Even without speaking tagalog your soul might be touched by that TV show.

And when it has touched one once you can't help but to become an die-hard
