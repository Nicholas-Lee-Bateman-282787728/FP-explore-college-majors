7922851,4,B00004TJR4,"There are 4 reason why to get this DVD.  2 gold statues and 2 great motion pictures. If the standard for excellence in directing films is how many Academy Awards one recieves for Best Director; then Forman has to be considered as one of the best directors of all time.
Forman has won two ""Best Director"" Academy Awards and he made two of the best films of all time.  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Amadeus.
I will never forget the time when I saw One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest for the first time. I was completely blown away...I just sat there in the theater for a few minutes afterword...just trying to collect my thoughts about what I've just seen. It was a very powerful and moving motion picture experience.
The reason why I took a look at this AFI documentary special was to learn more about Forman and the other films he made.  I didn't know of any other Forman film and I wanted to learn more.  This special DVD showed me glimpses of his deft, surgeons touch in making compelling drama. He has quite a touch in directing riveting and meaningful drama.",984441600,3,1065,4.418367346938775
