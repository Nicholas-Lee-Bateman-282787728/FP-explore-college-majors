5463586,4,B00AP2DC94,"This is a good collection of films with Morgan Freeman as Dr. Alex Cross.  Along Came a Spider is the better of the
two.  The second film, Kiss the Girls benefits from Ashley Judd's performance.  Overall, this is a very good purchase
and for a small cost.  Besides, Morgan Freeman brings a rare and wonderful quality to the films he does, making
them very entertaining and enjoyable to see.",1373068800,4,390,4.608695652173913
5463587,5,B00AP2DC94,"Excellent, I loved it. I had been familiar with the character for years, but had never seen any of the written novels transformed to movies. I was so impressed with my first exposure that I went out and bought DVD's on every story available.",1371859200,2,241,4.5
5463588,5,B00AP2DC94,I think Morgan Freeman is one of the best actors around at this time and I have yet to see him in a movie I didn't enjoy.  The plots are good with twists.,1367020800,2,154,3.6666666666666665
5463589,4,B00AP2DC94,"I gave this a 4-star because of the first movie: KISS THE GIRLS. I haven't read the book(s), so I don't know if they stayed true to them or not, but Mr. Patterson did enjoy the movie. At the beginning there is so much ""hop-scotching"" going on that it makes it difficult to follow the action and why they need to overuse the mobile camera and keep circling the actors  as the Indians did with the wagon trains of old, is beyond me. Once or twice, most of us can get the picture.  Now ALONG CAME A SPIDER was  directed much better and it made for a greater movie. It is sad that HELL-LYWOOD (not Hollywood anymore) needs to use such vulgar language that is only suited for our high-ranking politicians nowadays, as they will still get the ""R"" rating from the violence, which thankfully is not gory as in far too many movies. Both movie plots were very good and they will keep you guessing on who the real villains are. In KISS THE GIRLS, the ending scenes were NOT very real, as there is suppose to be a live gas line disconnected and nobody shuts the gas off!! If they cleaned up the language, both movies would be okay for T.V.. The quality of the DVDs are great as usual.  +JMJ+",1366416000,,1179,4.273542600896861
