8007037,5,B0001610VQ,"My two-year-old son loves this video. We have watched it a million times, and while ""Bill"" the ""Farmer"" (actually Bruce-the-actor) can sometimes be a little annoying, the actual content of the video is interesting and informative and paced quickly enough that a toddler can stay engaged with the action. Best of all, we have learned where milk and cheese come from, and the role that farmers play in our lives! The other videos in this series are also very good, but the favorite definitely seems to be Dairy Farm.",1174348800,,514,4.786516853932584
