8586174,5,B00CTP5OLO,"A fantastic DVD that is not for everyone.
I have only been playing a year and I was lost on chords and rhythms, so this is definitely a product for someone that is experienced (intermediate+).  However, I loved it.  This is like sitting in a 2 hour presentation with Rushad for only $20-$25 and you get to pause rather than just listening and trying to remember all that he goes over.
I can imagine newer students and those under 15 maybe getting frustrated by his pace through the movie (again, it's a presentation format), but if they pause/stop and take it in 15 minute segments (or after topics change) anyone with knowledge of the cello should be able to get through it.  I have only gotten through the first few topics as I wanted to stop and develop skills rather than race through.

My ADVICE: print off the PDF first.  It is 16 pages of notes and music that will help make so much more sense of what Rushad is doing, and it lists some of his common chords (which helped me, the amateur, a lot).
If you or someone you know wants to play the cello in a new and different way (folk, bluegrass, backing, etc.) this is a great reference and will provide inspiration as well as instruction.
My only suggestion for future DVDs of his is to have a screen break at the end of topics, because as this is a presentation style it quickly flows from topic to topic and some breaks to go and play on an instrument would be great to help develop the topic skill.
Love it and hoping to get back to this DVD again soon.",1444176000,4,1511,4.306338028169014
