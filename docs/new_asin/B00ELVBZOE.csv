I have never heard him speak before, i just took a chance because he was on a dvd and sometimes i like to listen and watch the person instead of a cd. He was crying so much, I thought that he needed a motvational speaker to talk to him. I thought Joel Osteen was bad, but this guy have him beat big time. To be honest with you, i was bored listening to him. I thought that i was at a family get together and he was showing all of his pictures since he was born. (Boring) I would not recommend this dvd to anyone. Maybe he is much better on another one, but i won't buy it.",1400889600,,623,3.9133858267716537
