8725445,5,B0125LIQ5W,"I love British cooking shows, especially ones centered on ""The Holidays"".  Lots of good advice and the shows put you in the holiday spirit.  I keep it on in the background while up getting things ready for friends and family to come over.  Jamie's delivery is a hoot...and he seems like such a nice guy.",1470700800,,303,4.472727272727273
