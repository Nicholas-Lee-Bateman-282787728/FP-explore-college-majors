2075861,5,B0002CDXDM,"I looked all over for this movie. I was so excited that Amazon had it and at a reasonable price. I saw it as a child on the Micky Mouse Club and fell in love with it and horses at the age of 9. It is as good as my memeory of it was. One for the whole family, and especially for the young ones who love horses! Of course, I am a young 56, and I still adore it! Now if Disney will just release Cristobel-a paso fino horse I will be in heaven!!!",1265932800,9,442,3.663157894736842
2075862,5,B0002CDXDM,"This movie shaped the lives of many girls of my generation (way old). As Ofoeti mentions in the review below, we ate and drank this movie. However, we had to keep reading the little paperback book, as there were no VHS machines yet. The little book came from a kids newspaper we used to get in school, I almost remember the name of that newspaper (Weekly Reader?). I was sorry to read in Mike's review that Annette did not enjoy the making of this movie, but I do know that she loves horses. Wasn't her husband first her horse wrangler? It is time to rerelease this on DVD. I wonder if it is Annette or Disney who is holding up the release of this movie, but if they don't release it soon, those of us who love it will be dead.
I was lucky enough to find a camp much like the movie in CA. I went to Cal Poly SLO and studied horses. I have bred horses ever since. Movies change lives.

2016: You can find The Horsemasters on You Tube! Even all these years later, I loved it. I'm sorry they were unkind to Annette. All too common, back then, for a women (girl) to be treated badly.",1191024000,39,1094,4.160377358490566
2075863,2,B0002CDXDM,"I bought this movie on VHS because I am a life-long Annette Fan who is filling out his collection. I never saw this movie when it was originally released because it was only released theatrically in Europe. Here in the U.S.A.,the movie was shown on ""Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color"" and that's the presentation you get here. In those days, most families had only one TV and that TV was usually B&W. I imagine my folks wanted to see ""Bonanza"". This is one of only two movies where Annette gets top billing, the other being ""How to stuff a Wild Bikini"". (When she worked with Frankie Avalon, his name came first.) That is, she would get top billing if there had been any billing. This movie opens with the Title only. Credits don't appear until the end. Annette is lovely here in color with her hair naturally dark and her big brown eyes in strict contrast to all the English actors and actresses in this movie. We're supposed to be in England. Maybe it's a backlot. Quite frankly, this movie bored me to tears and I had to fast forward through much of it. If you like horses, riding acadamies, fox hunts and things of that nature, you may enjoy it. Personally, I couldn't care less about dressage and riding to the hounds. The cast includes Tommy Kirk, Janet Munro and several people whom while mostly older than Annette had yet to make their mark in a big way: Donald Pleasance ""The Man in the Glass Booth"", a very young Jean Marsh ""Upstairs, Downstairs"". I find it very interesting that the person you can't keep your eyes off is Annette! She definitely had presence and Star Quality and you can see it here in a movie made when she was perhaps 18 years old. Of course, Annette sings a song near the end,: ""Strummin' Song"" written by the Sherman Bros. Annette hands the song over midway to a red-haired Englishwoman. I wondered who that woman could be? I scanned the closing credits and it's none other that West End/Broadway stage star Millicent Martin! (Side by side by Sondheim). Still aside from the footage of Annette and the trivia, this movie doesn't have much going for it in my opinion. Annette herself, who never has an unkind word for anyone has written in her book that making this movie was an unpleasant experience. It seems that her horse (Annette is a horsewoman) did't take to her and threw her for real several times. Also, the director was unkind to her, referring to her as ""Mr. Disney's Pet"". If that director reads this, in my opinion his movie stinks and he is a bum! So, there! I give this movie One Star for Annette alone and a combined one star for everyone else's lame efforts.",1181088000,4,2612,4.512658227848101
2075864,4,B0002CDXDM,"When I was a girl (lo these many, many years ago)this was my favorite movie in all the world.  My friends and I played ""Horsemasters"" endlessly (which was kind of pathetic, as we were just little middle-class suburban kids who had no access to horses) -- taking the movie plot and expanding on it as far as our imaginations would go.  Revisiting this film was such fun! The acting was fine, and the riding scenes are still exciting to see.  OK, it'll never rank up there with the Disney classics -- but it's actually more genuine than a lot of later-day Disney fare.  I'm glad ""The Horsemasters"" is still around and hope it finds an audience.",1170374400,21,642,4.508620689655173
2075865,3,B0002CDXDM,"A group of riding students (Tommy Kirk and Annette Funicello among them) must contend with unruly horses and a taciturn instructor (Donald Pleasance), all while trying to master the finer points of jumping, dressage, and sportsmanship. Not a great movie, but doesn't deserve to be forgotten. Based on a novel by Don Stanford.

8025853,5,B0002CDXDM,I have been waiting so long for this movie to show up at a reasonable price.  The copy is great.  Thank you so very much,1417737600,,120,3.76
8025854,4,B0002CDXDM,"Very good movie involving horses and also Annette. I would have thought Disney would have released this on dvd after Annette's passing, like in a tribute box set of movies. The vhs copies are getting older, rarer and very pricey, but don't count on Disney unless they know it will make money!",1405036800,3,292,4.634615384615385
8025855,5,B0002CDXDM,"I actually saw this movie in two parts on the Disney Sunday program, on 10-1-61 and 10-8-61.  I was in 4th grade.  It made a huge impression on me, and I've thought fondly of it throughout my life.  There's just something about it that I cannot forget, that continues to make me feel good.  Maybe it's the movie's upbeat nature, or the Englishness of it, or the camaraderie of the students, who knows.  After Annette Funicello died, I read a list of her movies in the paper. I had not known that the two Disney TV shows had been released as a movie.  In short order, I tracked it down on the internet and watched it last night, for the first time in over fifty years.  You might think that an adult would not necessarily like what a 4th grader liked, but I sure did, without qualification.  There's a timelessness to this movie that makes it still very appealing.  I'm going to London for a wedding in August, and I'm thinking about trying to find the location where it was filmed.  Am I a nut or what?  Looking around the internet, I was sad to find out that the movie Janet died at age 38 and that Tommy Kirk had had a rough go of it, with drugs and alcohol.  Otherwise, most of the actors had led successful, rewarding lives.  Jean Marsh, of course, developed ""Upstaris, Downstairs,"" one of the alltime great productions.  No matter who you are, take a chance on this movie.  You won't be disappointed.  Bill French, Rochester, MN.",1366070400,6,1434,4.416030534351145

8025858,3,B0002CDXDM,"I had forgotten how grainy VHS movies can be. This one is in not so good a shape. but I have a wall of VHS movies and a large collection of DVD's and I really have not watched a VHS movie in awhile. I was so desperate to have this movie as a collector, I have not found it anywhere else, so I'm thrilled to have it. I'm a Annette Funicello fan since I was five years old and I remember this movie playing on the Disney show on  two consecutive sunday's evenings. I did not see it again till it showed on cable TV, on the Disney channel. It brought back all the memories of my family sitting together watching it on our black and white TV. Thanks for your promptness in sending it, it was pretty beat up and torn by the time I received it, but so far the movie is good, I'm barely finishing watching it today 4/20/11, because I had surgery and then my first grandaughters wedding on my birthday and then the holidays. Then I had my first radiation treatment, and then the next round of radiation and then I got better, my Pop had a sudden stroke and passed away. Now we are eyeball high in moving my Mom out of her home and into my daughters, meanwhile she is with my husband and myself. After I finish writing this small cathartic note. Thanks by the way, I will indulge in a memory fest and finish watching the movie.",1303257600,,1318,4.1484375

8025860,4,B0002CDXDM,"All girls developed their first crushes watching this series on television.  As we aged by a very view years, our instructor in Pony Club gathered us all together for movie night to watch it again.
We ""critiqued"" everything that was done wrong in the movie.  It developed great comraderies in the group to call out grooming and riding errors while enjoying this Disney classic.  I agree with another reviewer that it should come out on DVD.  Thank You Disney for so many great childhood memories!",1292198400,11,496,4.8

8025862,5,B0002CDXDM,"""They come from all over the world, and they think they know it all.""  (Emphasis on ""think"").  So says the guy in charge of the ""Horsemasters"" course.  This is foreshadowing.  Even a person who has never seen a movie before will probably guess that this perception will be corrected soon, once the course begins.

Plot: EIght youngish adults, including Annette Funicello, are chosen to participate in the prestigious ""Horsemasters"" course of the title. This takes place in England.  They learn horsemanship.  They learn riding.  They learn life lessons.  They flirt.  That's pretty much it.

Warning: This is a Disney movie.  Therefore: All the fun is strictly G-rated. So is any romance.  People burst randomly into song, though not too often.  It's not a musical.

Other pros - at least if you're a horseperson - Everyone wears hats and boots when mounted.  Safety procedures around the horses are stressed.  I mention this only because so many horse movies have riders galloping through the fields with their hair flowing and other major infractions.  The hard hats are pretty flimsy by today's standards but at least they're worn.

The actors spend most of their screentime on horseback, either doing dressage, stadium jumping or going cross-country  At the end, there's a hunt race competition followed by a hunt.  The horses are cute, especially the pinto.  There's also some cool aerial shots of the horses jumping (usually they're filmed from the ground).  If you have a couple hours to kill before your riding lesson, you could do worse than watch this film.",1275696000,6,1567,5.011673151750973
