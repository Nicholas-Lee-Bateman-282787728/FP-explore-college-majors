7980054,5,B000088UN6,"If you are thinking about climbing Denali, this is an interesting overview of some of the history and the most common climbing route.  Kevin Flynn gives the perspective from an average guy trying to climb this  magnificent mountain as  opposed to a professional climber whos perspective would obviously be different.",1508889600,,316,5.28
7980055,2,B000088UN6,Ok - mostly not professionally done - a lot of home movie and home movie and noise.,1440374400,,83,3.9411764705882355

7980057,3,B000088UN6,Don't expect a slick documentary or a great deal of detailed information.  Worth the price if you are thinking about climbing Denali.,1376697600,,133,5.045454545454546
7980058,3,B000088UN6,Great scenes of Denali and a good description of the west buttress route but at times like a silly homemade video,1370908800,,113,4.428571428571429
7980059,5,B000088UN6,"Ascend Denali is a very well done documentary. The video shows two expeditons as well as a comentary by the first western buttress summiteer.
There is also an informative section about the gear one would need to Ascend Denali.",1198368000,,226,4.82051282051282
7980060,3,B000088UN6,"Having watched the DVD and climbed the mountain myself twice, I can say that overall it is useful as a very basic orientation rather than a preparation, with some remarks:

- the main character seems to underestimate the mountain. Fortunately he survives the first attempt in one piece, but it should be stressed that Denali should definitely not 'be your first big mountain'.

- Notable is late Bradford Washburn in some excellent pieces of interview, quoting Scott about the severity of Denali.

- The gear review (more than an hour) starts off with things that a Denali climber should already know and is more suitable for starting climbers (so NOT Denali climbers). But further on in the gear review, you will learn some more Denali specific issues which can be helpful when preparing.

- The info is a bit outdated, for example the Clean Mountain Can (for human waste) is not mentioned.

So, it will help get a good picture of what a Denali expedition is like, including failure on a trip (and success on a next one) so after watching this you can determine if this is something for you to work towards in the coming years or not. If so, do get the Combs & Rucksack Readers pocket guidebooks on Denali as well and only climb when very experienced. Do not count on a guide to mask your inexperience. If you are experienced and planning on Denali, then the gear section should be old news for you, but the route videos and route descriptions will still be very useful as an aid to planning and understanding the mountain.

The producers also have a DVD; Ascend Mt. Rainier, a bit more professionally made DVD about climbing Mt Rainier in Washington state, USA. It might be useful to watch and climb that first, be totally confident on mountains like Rainier before even thinking of Denali.",1169942400,8,1792,4.673015873015873
7980061,4,B000088UN6,Good overall veiw at climbing Denali. It really shows some of the possible pit falls in climbing such a mountian.,1168300800,,113,4.7
