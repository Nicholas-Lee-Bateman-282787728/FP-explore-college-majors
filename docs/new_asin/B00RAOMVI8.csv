The DVD cover explains the film. There are three races. Clay people, who are us. Then there are light people or angels which we don't see, but may be there. And then there are the Jinn who are fire people. They ruled the earth before the vulgar clay people took over and some of them want it back, while others like Darth Maul will help us.

Shawn (Dominic Rains) is part of a cursed line of a Jinn killing all the offspring in the line, but only once another child is born, then it kills the father. Shawn is married to Jasmine ( Serinda Swan) who is barren and can't have children, but is pregnant. Where have we seen this before?

The film has overt religious connections, but makes religion rather universal. A sword with a Hebrew symbol in the hilt is used against the Jinn. Also a glass container with blue liquid which looks like ""Angel for Men"" makes the Jinn angry when you smash it on their head.

The Jinn have all kinds of magical and supernatural powers and can kill us with a wink of an eye, but play by Hollywood rules.

Guide: Very mild swearing. No sex or nudity. Satan could use a bath and a haircut. Walmart $9.76 US",1429488000,2,1151,4.310185185185185
