8695978,4,B00RVAB830,"If this film hadn't preceded ""The Producers"" by four years Mel Brooks would have a plagiarism suit.  The makers of this film wouldn't have a ghost of a chance suing Brooks due to the ragtag nature of this enterprise.  This film has a fairly clever script about a crime syndicate bankrolling a bad TV pilot for the tax write-off done in by hack direction and amateurish production values.  That said I give it the pass because of the spirited work of the game cast and some genuinely funny moments.  You haven't lived until you've seen Maurice Chevalier and Jayne Mansfield reenacting the window scene from ""Romeo and Juliet"".  Speaking of Mansfield a better representation of her work can be had with ""The Jayne Mansfield Collection"" released some years ago by Fox with includes ""The Girl Can't Help It"", ""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter"", and ""The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw"".",1431993600,,874,4.8389261744966445
8695979,5,B00RVAB830,"Panic Button is a 1964 film Jayne made in Europe. Her best Hollywood years behind her, she still looks great and does a fine job. Jayne fans love her in anything.  Eleanor Parker provides good support.",1395446400,,201,4.583333333333333
8695980,1,B00RVAB830,"The one star is awarded for the quality of the 'Synergy Archive' PRODUCT not the movie, which I would give three stars.  Purchasers need to be aware that this is a very poor quality DVD, no better than a pirate copied from a VHS.  It is truly shocking that an icon such as Jayne Mansfield should be so poorly treated, and it spoils the enjoyment of this light comedy.  Admittedly it is not one of Jayne's best, but it has some entertainment value.",1384473600,,447,4.36144578313253
8695981,2,B00RVAB830,"this movie is kind a UFO... never seen in France (or very briefly), though Chevalier was French... the quality of the dvd is poor, but it's watchable. in fact, the movie suffers from a very bad cutting, directing.... suffers from everything: a good story spoiled. But Jayne is not overacting, which is an opportunity to see her ""au naturel"", not too bad an actresse at all! a few moments on the beach, in bikini, romancing with co star: she looks stunning! a pity the studios dropped her for so bad films.",1314835200,7,505,4.56043956043956
8695982,3,B00RVAB830,"I bought this dvd with the hopes that someone had mastered the print, but it is no better than the vhs copy I have owned for years. Definitely watchable but the quality of the print gives it a bad overall look. Such a shame, one of Jayne's best comedic movie roles and she has never looked better!! Hip, Hip Hooray Mansfield!!!!! Boo to all the cheap companies that want to make a buck on a crap quality print.",1310428800,12,410,4.269230769230769
8695983,5,B00RVAB830,"This film is extremely RARE!!! Never before on DVD!!! (this is the first time). It's a low-budgeted film, but, the lovely Jayne Mansfield,makes up for that. The film tells a very witty story, about two stage performers making the motion picture dbut. IF YOU ARE A """"JAYNE MANSFIELD"""" FAN I HEAVILY SUGGEST YOU BUY THIS FILM WHILE IT'S STILL AVAIABLE!!!!",1308268800,3,353,4.9
