8220530,3,B000VY2MEM,"This movie was developed to teach FBI agents, probably around the 1930's.  Although the equipment is old, like wooden boxes for crime scene equipment storage, the basic concepts are correct.  Interesting to watch if you are a fan of CSI, or teach Criminal Justice.",1295654400,,264,4.9772727272727275
