7712048,4,B01DEPHYLA,My son loves these! He will be three months old on January 28th. Received them within almost a week. Only discrepancy is we've gotten to almost the 6th DVD and two of them skip a little in the previews and such. Actual shows themselves are great thus far. Again. Only on the sixth DVD out of 26,1515974400,3,294,4.175438596491228

7712064,5,B01DEPHYLA,"they were a gift for a 4 month old,  who really seem to love watching the screen, hearing the music and seeing the colors and movement.  I believe that they are a wonderful learning tool for the baby and an enjoyable activity at the same time.",1524355200,,243,4.260869565217392
7712065,1,B01DEPHYLA,"The name is deceiving. You would expect quality, but what you get is a bad puppet production with unnecessarily slow action.

7712067,3,B01DEPHYLA,Baby Einstein isn't that great. Maybe for a 4 month old. You're kid's already too old at 1 year old. It's kinda drivel. Good thing it was only $27.,1524096000,,147,4.103448275862069

7712069,5,B01DEPHYLA,Bought these for my daughter she loves them so much. I grew up with my mom playing these DVDs for my sister. You can't order order them from the baby website anymore so I was super excited to find the box set here. These DVDs are super educational and they keep my daughter well entertained. I'm so happy with this purchase I have asked my sister in law who just had a baby this weekend if she will let her son watch them. If she like the DVDs I'm ordering a set for my nephew as a baby gift !,1523836800,,493,3.94
7712070,5,B01DEPHYLA,"I have a thirteen year old daughter and I recently gave birth to my second child, my son who is now seven months old. At 44, I just don't have the same amount of patience as I did when my daughter was little. So I would start to unravel whenever we had a baby DVD. I remembered my daughter liking Baby Einstein dvds, so we put it in the vcr. Thankfully my son likes Baby Einstein dvds too because they aren't annoying like the other baby videos on the market, but they are expensive. So when I saw the entire collection of Baby Einstein dvds for such a great price, I just knew something had to be wrong. I honestly expected the dvds to be in a different language or something, but they're not. All the dvds are there and they all play perfectly. Wow, I was not expecting that! My son gets to watch educational dvds that didn't cause us to go bankrupt and my daughter and I won't be wearing a straight jacket any time soon. . Lol",1523404800,7,929,4.166666666666667

7712083,5,B01DEPHYLA,He actually wants to watch them over tv and movies! I feel like he learns thing twice as fast as when I try to teach him things.

7712089,5,B01DEPHYLA,"I bought these for my granddaughter who is expecting her first baby soon. She requested this set because I bought the original set for her sister when she was a baby , who is now 13 years old and is very intelligent. She reads all the time on her Kindle and I also bought her the HARRY POTTER book set for Christmas (even though she had already read them but is rereading again.  The original EINSTEIN does are very educational and of very good quality. The woman and her husband who filmed them did excellent work and research to compile them. They make a nice gift for expectant parents.",1517616000,5,589,4.4036697247706424

8755781,5,B01DEPHYLA,"Just received this set  and have only watched 5 of the discs (which work perfectly, knock on wood) so I may be going out on a limb to review it so soon.....but out 16 month absolutely LOVES these. He first encountered shortened versions of B.E. videos on Youtube and  enjoyed them thoroughly.  So, in spite of some mixed reviews about the quality of the discs I took a chance.

I like the fact that they're not overly chatty like some PBS cartoons....and I think the classical music is a good introduction for him, while being relaxing as background music for me while I cook. So unless there are some problems on the unwatched discs I'm giving these an enthusiastic recommendation.

And in case you are unaware of the series 'Baby Signing Time' ......where babies learn some sign language in a very entertaining way, please check those out too. We have found them to be a wonderful learning experience for ourselves as well as our toddler. He spent many months just taking it all in....but now he has a sign vocabulary of 15 or so words.",1535587200,,1038,4.589189189189189
