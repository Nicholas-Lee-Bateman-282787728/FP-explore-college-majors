8698331,5,B003GXAN82,"I am overly impressed with this presentation, you can watch the form with master Xu on youtube to get an idea of the simplicity and effectiveness of this system.

It is presented as The complete form along with training exercises and hand drills for the sword movement, it also goes into detail of each individual movement of the form and how to correctly apply the movement and lastly it shows the application of each movement of the system demonstrated in detail against a opponent as well as the techniques which alone are more then worth it.

The production is not the best but more of the ""understanding"" and certain techniques will be revealed as you progress in your skill level. It is presented with everything you need to know on how it works and how to apply it. For those who are interested in learning and teaching yourself I would say that this system is simplistic in movement specifically the footwork when compared to other internal martial art systems yet is just as effective. This is a high level straight sword combat system which is based on deception and trickery and their is a lot of psychology to it, also the 8 Immortals sword is one of the main systems taught on Wudang mountain. Master Xu is exceptional and I am very pleased that he has left this knowledge for us that will be cherished for generations to come.",1336694400,2,1340,4.602510460251046
