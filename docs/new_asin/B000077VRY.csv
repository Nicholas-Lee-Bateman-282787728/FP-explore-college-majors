1803414,2,B000077VRY,"Though I like Rachel Leigh Cook, and like her turn as a sulky (but really sweet) girl in 'She's All That,' and love to see her in anywhere you name it, 'Tangled' is a wrong choice.  As a thriller, it is not intriguing; as a love story, it is too familiar.  And the story is, as the film says, too tangled to take it seriously.

It is about a love-triangle that got tangled -- David (Shawn Hatsey), Alan (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and Jenny (Rachel Leigh Cook), all juniors at a college.  Jenny and David are seeing each other when Alan, handsome and reckless, steps into their college life out of the blue.  Quiet boy David (who studies poetry) and Alan were in fact friends when much younger, but because of some incidents in the past, their relations was an awkward one.  And because of Jenny's ambiguous attitudes to Alan, and Alan's seductive attitudes to Jenny, things get more complicated, and more dangerous.

That's what the opening of the film implies, by the choppy shots of flashbacks.  The film follows the memories of David, who, now hospitalized after some (still unknown) terrible accident, recounts his story before the investigator Lorraine Bracco.  So, here, the film also tries to give a twist to the otherwise mundane story, using flashbacks that slowly reveals the key events in the past.

The original intention is good, and there is a decent film buried behind the film (which I am afraid no one in English-speaking coutries have seen in theater).  There are some good shots that suggest the emotional tense between the characters.  And Rachel Leigh Cook is as sweet as before, and sexy at times.

But, unbelievably, the film takes almost one hour to explain the relations between the three, which is not particularly original.  And after that, it drifts into the revelation of the facts, in the style that faintly resembles 'Rashomon.'  But what can you do in thirty minutes with that format when you need more time to present the shifting viewpoints that challenge our perception of reality?

My overall reaction to 'Tangled' was like -- What happened to RLC?  She is as busy as before, as far as I can see her filmography on internet, but living in Japan, I hear about less and less.  Please, no more this, or 'Get Carter' or 'Anti-Trust.'

By the way, Estella Warren appears, but her role is very small, and her turn is not very outstanding.  Sorry.",1095465600,,2372,4.7250608272506085
1803415,4,B000077VRY,TANGLED IS ACTUALLY A REALLY GOOD MOVIE. YOU HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION OR YOU'LL GET LOST IN THE PLOT BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE.,1071532800,,139,4.0
1803416,1,B000077VRY,"I really like Shawn Hatosy, so I really wanted to like this movie; unfortunately, I was very disappointed.  In essence, ""Tangled"" is yet another college love triangle.  David (Shawn Hatosy) is in love with his best friend, Jen (Rachael Leigh Cook), but she falls for one of David's friends, Alan (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers).  David is the protypical ""nice"" guy, who Jen considers to be just a friend.  David's jealousy flairs when she falls for Alan, who may be just a touch insane.  The story is told in flash-back after David is found beaten in the woods.  The movie tells of the beginnings of these relationships, as well as the inevitable disintegration.
On the plus side, Shawn Hatosy is solid in the lead and likeable.  The movie also features some good music and decent cinematography.  Unfortunately, Rachael Leigh Cook comes across as a vapid ditz, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers engages in some serious scenery-chewing (as does Lorraine Bracco, slumming from the ""Sopranos"").  The plot is not particularly believable and tries too hard to have a supposedly ""shocking"" resolution (which is pretty predictable).  I also found that I didn't even remotely care about the characters or what happened to them.  Recommended only for fans of Shawn Hatosy and/or tepid romance thrillers.",1053475200,,1277,5.120772946859903
1803417,2,B000077VRY,"Rachael Leigh Cook stars and looks amazing in this disappointing movie.
Rachael Leigh Cook's character is torn between her male best friend who has feelings for her, and her boyfriend who is slightly off the rails. We begin with the best friend in hospital and he is being questioned by a detective played by Lorraine Bracco. Via the bestfriend's flashbacks which may or may not be true, the detective has to piece together what happened between the girl, the best friend and the boyfriend.
The quality of filming isn't too bad in itself but there just isn't enough substance to the story. I suggest you buy ""Tangled"" if you are a Rachael Leigh Cook fan, but if not, you're not gonna exactly be heartbroken if you don't have this on your DVD shelf.
I'm not saying it's terrible- it just could have been so much better.",1048809600,,818,4.609589041095891

7974497,2,B000077VRY,"Plot spoilers.

I didn't like any of the characters in this movie. Shawn Hatsoy plays the main character (David) who is a ginger loser. He is awkward around girls and is obsessed with Jenny, a free spirit (borderline slut) who sees him as a friend and apparently the only girl who will give him the time of day in all of the college kingdom. He tries to win her over by writing poetry, which isn't half bad until he reads it aloud. She meets David's friend Alan (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) who asks her out and poses nude for her (the only nudity in this movie is sausage) which leads to a sexual encounter. They become lovers and David feels rejected and hurt. Alan is the third psycho in this group as he pledges his love for Jenny while he bangs a blonde. None of the characters were nice people and could all be described as losers. I was most sad that they didn't all die. Yes, Rachel Leigh Cook runs around in a pair of cute panties in the beginning and that is as good as the movie gets.",1283990400,,989,4.26063829787234

7974499,5,B000077VRY,"I thought this movie was great. It is not a major Hollywood Blockbuster, but is is a very good ""film noir"" of sorts. Shawn Hatosy plays the main character,David, and is by far the weakest actor in this cast, but it works very well for the plot, and may be on purpose. David is in love with Jenny (Rachael Leigh Cook)and whe he introduces her to Alan (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers)who is and old friend, at some sort of family reunion. They (Jenny & Alan) become an item very quickly. The problem being Alan has a habit of leaving people devastated in his past, and David is worried the same will become of Jenny. That is when the plot starts to thicken. I would love to say more but I do not want to give anything away. I am not a fan of (Rachael Leigh Cook) but I thought she did very well in this film and the twists the plot takes are worth the watch multiple times. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers turns in his usual fantastic preformance. The directing is very good, and some interesting camera angles keep the eye entertained.
I can definately reccommend this as a nice addition to any DVD collection.",1219968000,,1088,4.417910447761194
7974500,1,B000077VRY,"Tangled (Jay Lowi, 2001)

Shawn Hatosy has been doing the character-actor thing in Hollywood for a long time. Lowi, in his first feature film, gives Hatosy a starring role, and pairs him opposite established stars Rachael Leigh Cook (Antitrust) and Jonathan Rhys Meyers (Titus), as well as throwing Lorraine Bracco (The Sopranos) into the mix-- and he still can't come up with a good movie.

Now, I'll watch Jonathan Rhys Meyers in anything, and I have, and I still had trouble with this mess. The basic idea: David Klein (Hatosy) wakes up in a hospital with a police detective (Bracco) at his side. It seems Kelin's girlfriend Jenny (Cook) and his best friend Alan Hammond (Meyers) are both missing from the wreckage of Hammond's car, where Klein was found. Klein relates the story of the relationship between the three of them to the detective, piecemeal, with scenes from the present intercut.

Predictable, boring, cliched, two-dimensional, need I go on? If the ending of Jodi Picoult novels comes as a shock to you, you may find the big reveal here to be a surprise. No one else will. * ",1176336000,,1092,4.792553191489362

Hatosy tells the story in flashback telling the story to cop Lorraine Bracco (The Sopranos, Medicine Man). This boring story has no likable characters and invokes really thin interest with me. Cook is really stale, Hatosy, as much as a good actor he is is rendered dull and Meyers plays another sleaze ball like in most of his thrillers. Worth a look and by god Im not looking again and towards the end you're like....WHY I DID I RENT THIS?!!. Also starring Estella Warren (Planet of the Apes remake).",1130630400,,916,4.954545454545454
