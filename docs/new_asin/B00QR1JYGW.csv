8692411,3,B00QR1JYGW,"Disc 1 states: ""This biography contains no original music by AC/DC.  It is not authorized by the band, their record company or their management.""

Package states: ""This set is not sanctioned by AC/DC, nor by any of its members past or present.""

The only AC/DC members interviewed was the original lead singer Dave Evans, the original drummer Colin Burgess, and clips from an interview with Bon Scott.  Some friends of Angus, Malcolm, and Bon are interviewed about their early days.  There are clips and pictures of the band through the years but it's mostly just interviews with a few music writers.  The focus of this set is on the early days of Bon Scott and AC/DC and only runs through the ""Back In Black"" album in 1980.  I thought since it was titled ""40 Years Of Rock,"" it actually might cover the band's 40 years.

Disc 2 does have a few brief snippets of AC/DC music.  But mostly disc 2 had just the music writers giving their reviews of the songs on the ""Back In Black"" album and interviews with Tony Platt, the engineer on the album.

While I was very disappointed in this DVD, it was good to finally hear interviews with Dave Evans and Colin Burgess.  These two are never mentioned at all in other AC/DC documentaries.  It's similar to how the Beatles never mention their original drummer Pete Best.  These guys were part of the history of these bands.  Since the documentary mainly focuses on AC/DC's early years, I was surprised there was no mention of the Marcus Hook Roll Band, the group that included Angus and Malcolm with their brothers George and Alex Young as well as Harry Vanda.  Their brother Alex is also never mentioned in AC/DC documentaries either.",1424131200,9,1675,4.649659863945578
8692412,2,B00QR1JYGW,"Contains NO AC/DC MUSIC and no interviews with band members.  This is a good documentary with lots of information (from media and other non-band members) but I feel the product description is a bit misleading by omitting the lack of AC/DC music and band member participation.

The DVD menus are amateurish.  A gray screen with text selections at the bottom for the main menu on disc one.  I can do better on my PC.  The soundtrack is stereo (no point to surround sound without music.)

I do feel it was worth the $18 but be clear about not providing any AC/DC music or band member interviews.",1424131200,7,592,4.537735849056604
