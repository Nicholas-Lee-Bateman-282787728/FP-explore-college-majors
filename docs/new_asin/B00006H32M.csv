3499617,5,B00006H32M,"I acquired both your DVDs on ""Learn to Salsa"" and I think they are wonderful.  The way you present the lessons are so easy to follow and so enjoyable too.  The only thing is that they left me thursty for more, a lot more!  I see dancers here doing simple stuff and looking so good, but I have no idea how to do it.  I think this is the bread and butter of salsa dancing for beginners and the stepping stone for becomming advanced.",1078704000,5,430,4.083333333333333
3499618,5,B00006H32M,"I have never been much of a dancer.  Like most men I know, I dreaded the moment my lady would drag me out on the dance floor at cousin Susy's wedding.  Only drunk uncle Billy 'dancing' his rendition of Y-M-C-A could save me from my embarrassing moment in the spotlight.
But when a friend introduced me to salsa through this video, I became enlightened.  This video shows just how Ultra-Sexy salsa is.  And guys, here's the secret - it's surprisingly easy to master a few basic moves that will get you out on the floor with confidence.
Trust me gentlemen, the ladies are who make salsa sexy.  But they need you out on the floor... and they will love you for it.",1070496000,9,660,4.377049180327869
3499619,5,B00006H32M,"A great follow-up to Vol 1.
Each of the 8 combinations presented here is made up of multiple steps with all kinds of wraps, lady's swivels and some shine work for both partners. There is also a really cool Tango dip thrown in. As a bonus, we are treated to 2 dance demonstrations by Raul and Tenia, which puts their talent and outstanding dance partnership into full display. As with Vol 1, Tenia incorporates some more styling for ladies which can be put into practice straight away.
DVDs are highly recommended if you plan to use video as your main learning tool due to the ease of use and outstanding visual quality.",1058832000,9,619,4.535714285714286
3499620,1,B00006H32M,"This video would have been great if not for the cheesy editing, crummy instruction and lame music. What a total waste of money. I recommned that this be filed under ""Worst Salsa Video Ever""!",1056153600,2,190,4.617647058823529
3499621,5,B00006H32M,"I was told to see this video and it's better than any thing I've seen (I don't know what that 'neallatino' review is talking about.  I already have the other videos he reviewed, and he is CRAZY if he doesn't think this is the best one-- if he really dances salsa).  The ones he says are good, are the worst quality and I can't hardly hear the teachers talk.
This video here has 8 steps, but they put like 4 different moves in each step, for men and women, so it's more like 20-30 steps. And i think when the teachers put background scenes w/ their students and the teachers talking & goofing around in the video, it makes it a lot more interesting to watch because regular videos get boring! I watched this many times and I love it.  I'm an intermediate dancer but i'm going to buy their beginner DVD because this is seriously better then any videos or classes i've reviewed.",1044403200,5,875,4.323170731707317
3499622,2,B00006H32M,"If anyone is impressed by this video they have never seen a decent Salsa instructional video.
With only 8 routines in the video it is certainly not good value for the money.
Over half the video is self promotion for the Salsa teachers.
I mean I really do not care if their students think they are great or how well Raul plays the piano ( he does not ).
Over half the video is a waste of time.
The fact that they call themselves the salsa world's top instructors should give you a clue.
This is an intermediate level video with nothing new. Just the most common moves that have been around for years.
I feel I wasted my money buying it.
There are a lot better Salsa videos being sold on Amazon.",1038268800,6,693,4.2180451127819545
3499623,5,B00006H32M,"I have two left feet and doing salsa was the last thing on my mind. I could never bring myself joining dance classes after all I don't want to embarrass myself in front so many people.

My friend who's also like me but a little enthusiast got this DVD and in no time she was dancing like real advanced dancers. I got one for myself and gave it a go...bingo it worked! It's so simple, Raul and Tenia makes it more and more fascinating and interesting. They beautifully demonstrates step-by-step the lead and follow of dance, tension and connection and many basic partnering moves. A list of some funky different moves are demonstrated and intricately explained. The music selection is great with a good beat. A killer DVD and a BLAST to watch! Perfect for the beginner to VERY advanced dancer.",1136851200,,792,4.617021276595745
3499624,5,B00006H32M,Woo this DVD is hot!!! Sam and I dance everyday. We play our favorite Latin song and spend sometime doing out lil moves and turns. We are a huge fan of salsa...we met in a salsa club 2 years back and that's how our romance started. Both Sam and I couldn't continue with our salsa classes for some reasons which was a big big pain for us. He heard about this DVD from friend and he got one for me. I went totally crazy watching the videos and couldn't help myself from dancing. I just love the music and the instructions are way too good. It should be awarded for the best DVD...it's not only for the intermediates but should work for the beginners too coz it's so simple to follow and they explain everything step by step which is not a problem to understand. We go clubbing every weekends and we stand out!!!,1136851200,,809,4.259740259740259
3499625,5,B00006H32M,"I'm Jordan and I've been doing salsa for the past 5 years. I bought a couple of CD's and DVD's on salsa but nothing appealed me much. They have great music and good instructors but the materials are never enough. Maybe for a professional dancer like me, if I watch the video I won't have much problem in learning the steps but for beginners or the intermediate students, they may face some difficulty in grabbing the moves but this DVD offers so much that I think its one of the best DVD's that I've ever come across. The instructors demonstrate each and every step systematically and it's so well explained that any one could just learn it in a jiffy. They know how and what to teach and what suits best for which level...very professional and awesome DVD. I highly recommend this DVD and I would like to congratulate these guys for coming up with such a brilliant DVD. Great work!!!",1136851200,,884,4.496894409937888
3499626,5,B00006H32M,I would like to thank everyone whoever put so much on making this wonderful DVD. This was hela one great experience. Everything is organized perfectly - I did not expect that I would find so much in a DVD. The music was happy and now I'm more a salsa addict than I was before. There is nothing to fear but a little pain and embarrassment if your partner steps on your foot lol. It has lots of patterns that one could easily learn. It offers you so much more that you can ever imagine...xcellent DVD!!!!!,1136851200,,503,4.3052631578947365
3499627,5,B00006H32M,"Dancing is something I've always loved. Been dancing different kinds of dances since I was a kid. I did my first stage performance when I was 9. My wonderful husband never stopped me from doing stage shows but unfortunately I stared putting on too much weigh after having 3 beautiful kids and couldn't continue coz my body felt heavy. Having been a professional dancer in the 80's I almost wondered how I was able to dance without the benefit of training my body. Salsa was something I really wanted to learn but having a heavy body...I thought it would be too stressful. My husband got me this DVD and I totally went nuts watching the video. I dance every morning and every night and sometimes my husband joins me. Now im getting the benefit of learning and making my dance practice as my work out regime. This DVD specialties in teaching beginners the in's and out's of the most popular Latin dances, and then sharing great tips and moves for those who want to expand their basic knowledge. Ultimate DVD for all salsa lovers!!!",1136764800,,1029,4.5978260869565215
3499628,5,B00006H32M,One word `Wonderful!' Raul and tenia are wonderful dancers. I love the way they dance and the way they instruct. They create this whole salsa vibe that makes one to stand up and dance. I've seen other great dancers dance but I've never come across partners like them- they are so much in sync and they teach you the perfect movements of partnering! Now I won't hesitate to dance with new people since I know the techniques of starting and spinning etc...I've perfected my moves and I can't want to swing with a perfect partner who dances perfectly like me!,1136764800,,556,4.57
3499629,5,B00006H32M,"cannot even begin to tell you what a wonderful experience I had watching and learning dance from this amazing video. It was possible that I learn salsa at the age of 35 especially when you have to work 6 days a week for 11 hrs a day. Work leaves me quite stressed and boring coz on holidays all I want to do is laze around and sleep. My friend gave me this DVD on my birthday and now every time I wanna do something special on weekends I play this DVD and dance away to glory. I'm truly amazed with Raul and Tenia...they are way too talented, personable, bursting with infectious good energy. I still am a wannabe in Salsa, but I'm getting there poco a poco. Great buy!!!",1136764800,,671,4.209302325581396
3499630,5,B00006H32M,"A truly amazing DVD. Raul & Tenia are too cool and awesome. They not only teach you the simple steps to shaking your booty but also the partnering aspect of starting, controlling, and stopping spins. In this DVD, Raul and Tenia demonstrate stylized body movements during partnering. They demonstrate what to do if you're off beat, what to do when the woman is turning, cross body lead and open break styling, partnering techniques incorporating styling, and adds a few bonus moves and men's shines. This is a great buy and if you don't have one go a grab your copy...you don't want to miss the fun especially if you have a hot partner ;-)",1136764800,,638,4.605263157894737
3499631,5,B00006H32M,"Learn to Salsa Instructional VOL. 2 is truly amazing. I enjoyed every bit of it as much as I enjoyed part 1. Salsa has always fascinated me, but learning all those moves seemed next to impossible as I am a wee bit on the heavier side. I always thought Salsa was a difficult dance, but watching and following the stepwise instructions made salsa so simple for me.

Thanks to this magnificent DVD, I never thought that I'd be doing all those groovy moves. I've learnt each and every step by heart and trust me I had no problem in learning them, it was just like a walk in the park.

Everyone talks about my zealous passion and my funky moves and I leave no chance in flaunting my moves and my ability to dance. It's so much convenient and cheaper. You won't want to invest so much money on going to an instructor everyday doing the same moves which you can learn it from home. Part 1 works best for beginners and once you perfect yourself in your moves you can precede with part 2. Grab a copy today; you won't wanna miss a part of it. I guarantee you with 100% assurance, you're not gonna regret!",1130284800,3,1095,4.285024154589372
3499632,5,B00006H32M,"Learn to Salsa Vol 2 is definitely one of the better quality salsa instructional videos I've come across.  Raul & Tenia (especially) are sexy dancers.  This is precisely how salsa is supposed to be danced.  I've practiced and mastered 5 of the 7 sequences and my salsa has moved up a few knotches, as I've been told by folks in the DC salsa community.  My dance parter has also received similar feedback.
After Raul instructs the men on their part, Tenia breaks down the women's part.  Many salsa videos fail to do this.  Raul & Tenia also included shines in this video.  Most salsa instuction videos tend to focus 100% on partnering which is good, but there is more to salsa, especially for those who like to let loose, freestyle and spice things up.
Video & audio quality are good, and the rooftop scene is a nice touch.  Criticisms: (1) The night club piece at the end was very HOT, but it would have been nice to see them dance with other people.  (2) There was a small clip where Raul & Tenia's show off their shoes. This was a good opportunity for them to say a word or two about the best kind of dance shoes for salsieros.  (3) For an intermediate-advanced salsa video, they should have/could have squeezed in an additional 3 sequences.
Overall: great buy!!!",1083801600,20,1265,4.508771929824562
8284964,2,B00006H32M,"Have had both volumes for years... Have never learned much from them. In the end, you're probably better off taking a class and working with the people who show up to practice - and learn from each other. I didn't think so then, but I do now. Just go to a dance place and put your hours in there... Watching and practicing salsa to a DVD is like learning to ride a bike from a book.",1526688000,,382,4.0394736842105265
8284965,4,B00006H32M,"These dancers are smooth and graceful, which is not quite my style as I am more aggressive and rhythmic but they are definitely good and I am learning many of the patterns as many followers like these graceful moves.  This is not the new crazy tricks some salsa dancers are doing so know that before you buy.  Some of the patterns may seem a little similar to other ones they do, but overall well worth the $20",1412294400,,410,4.311688311688312
8284966,5,B00006H32M,very good instructions by both male and female teachers.  also nice and fancy routine steps.  but the steps are for advanced dancers.,1403049600,,133,5.0
8284967,3,B00006H32M,"There's not much to say here.  Average NY salsa on 2 moves for beginners.  Nothing spectacular, nothing very sexy, nothing I haven't seen before at the NY socials.  Needless to say, I'm a little disappointed because I bought this video looking to learn hot & sexy salsa moves and styling.  I didn't see none of that, just a bunch of turn patterns.  It's good for beginners who are looking to learn new turn patterns though.",1203552000,,423,4.586666666666667
8284968,5,B00006H32M,"Great salsa moves.  Higher level of difficulty but if you get them down, you'll be awesome.  Good instruction.",1194048000,,110,5.055555555555555
8284969,5,B00006H32M,"I just started salsa this yr. and I got to tell you, I can do these moves shown on this video only because the way they explaine it. Very easy to fallow. One thing about the video,I think it could have been a little longer, maybe at the end before the dance they could have thrown a little solo steps for men and women you don't see that alot. This is a very nice video my wife and I love it. Thanks Raul & Tani great job.

8284970,5,B00006H32M,I own 7 more salsa DVDs and this is one of my favorites. There is no pattern that hasn't taught me something new. I like the best how in this DVD they explain the ladies' styling. It is easy to follow and fun. I only wish it was longer.,1174694400,,236,3.836734693877551
8284971,1,B00006H32M,Im an old school REAL SALSA DANCER and I purchased this DVD to see all the crazy new things that these crazy people are doing. But in doing so I saw the horrible dancing that these San Fransisco/N.Y/Casino people do! This type of dancing for starters is for show... and that being said it takes away the essence of the dancing spirit. I dance the old school Puerto Rican way and I will never trade it for the world REAL SALSA. If you wanna look like a robot and a total ass of yourself go ahead and watch this video... if you want to dance go learn from any of my hispanic brothers and sisters well be more than happy than to teach you.,1140998400,9,636,4.137096774193548
8284972,5,B00006H32M,Salsa makes me feel good about myself. It takes me to a different level altogether. The whole approach of this DVD adds another dimension to your existing knowledge and enhances your performance. It helps you to understand the beauty of salsa better. A must buy for holistic salsa experience!,1136851200,,292,4.979591836734694
8284973,5,B00006H32M,"I know how to do Salsa but let's just say that it stays in basic. I love to experiment so when I heard about this sexy and stylish approach, I'd say I was pretty excited and couldn't wait to enhance my Salsa skills. I even talked my boyfriend into it and both of us are having a ball. It's like another side of Salsa which I thought never existed.  A must buy for Salsa lovers. It's worth every penny!",1136851200,2,401,4.075949367088608
