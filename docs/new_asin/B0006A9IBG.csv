8738435,4,B0006A9IBG,"It was the early 1970's and I perchance met and started hanging around with this fellow named Stan. Now he was REALLY different. Wild, bazaar, animated, electric energy, theatrical. He would engage you in his world, with in your face action. Then he went off to clown school, come on, how many people do you know that go off to clown school. Cut to 2015, I'm trying to remember his name, and bang, Stan Edwards, Jango pops in my head. Got his dvd, his work is a testament to living your craft. I laughed, smiled and remembered, this unique young man who wanted to be a clown, and did so to the max. BRAVO!",1438992000,2,605,4.315789473684211
