8314273,3,B001K1ZU0S,"A fine martial arts revenge movie, with Ping Chen as the titular herione and she does a very good job. There is at least one unexpected twist and a couple of unusual scenes, especially for Chinese cinema. I won't give one of them away as it really is a plot point, but the other is something many of us men might like to see more of, a martial arts fight with a topless woman! The acting is pretty good for a 70s Chinese film, and the subtitles are much better than the usual badly translated stuff I am used to. Even though the fight scenes are obviously choreographed they are still enjoyable.",1505433600,,595,4.321428571428571
8314274,4,B001K1ZU0S,"The film is in Mandarin with English subtitles. This is pretty much a rated R film as there are some female nudity.  The kung-fu scenes were choreographed pretty well and direction was not bad.  The acting is good.  It was nice to see a female hero who fights off the bad guys.

As per story, there is a new emperor who doesn't want society to know him as a bad emperor even though he has hired assassins to kill any one who disagrees with him or bad mouths him.  He also burns all the books to not allow any one to be intelligent enough to know he's a bad emperor.  He even kills some of the highest officers and judges.  He has a secret force of assassins managed by a general that he assigns to behead any one he wants until one day he chose the wrong family to mess with.  This family consists of a couple whose husband is a local head detective and the wife is a high level martial artist who also is a private assassin.  The head detective one day while investigating a beheading questions the suspect who admits that he was sent by the emperor to conduct assassinations.  Worried that this could be a problem, the emperor sends the assassins to kill the head detective's entire family.  It just so happens that the wife went out to visit her late master's grave site and encounters her kung-fu brother.  By the time she gets home, her husband's entire family is slaughtered including her husband.  Pregnant, she decides to run away to her husband's uncle whom she never met.  Along the way, she meets a chef who once happen to be one of the emperor's assassins, but he decided to leave that life-style only to be chased by the emperor as well.  Also, her kung-fu brother caught up with her.  Both the chef and kung-fu brother become her body guards until she reaches her husband's uncle.  Time and time again, she is being ambushed.  At the end she decides to get revenge for all that she has suffered.",1503360000,,1909,4.39031339031339

8314277,5,B001K1ZU0S,"All three Flying Guillotine movies are great, but this a better sequel than Flying Guillotine 2 in my opinion.

So glad this is subtitled.  I like to be able to hear the original actors' intonations, not a goofy overdub.",1491955200,,220,4.615384615384615

8314280,4,B001K1ZU0S,"This could have been four and a half. Subtitles are a drag on any film but these were shown with plenty of time to read. The staging, scenery and overall acting was quite good. The plot line too was well done. I would recommend this to anyone. The ability to speak mandarin, which is what I presume they were speaking, would certainly though be a plus!",1485043200,,352,4.348484848484849
