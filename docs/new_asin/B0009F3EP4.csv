8059896,3,B0009F3EP4,"This is the first volume of Nick Jr. Favorites. To me, some of them are Favorites, although some of them I don't like. You'll have your own opinions, so I'll just let you know what's on the DVD and give some brief thoughts. It's also worth mentioning that there are no special features, although there are previews for a few things --- ""Blue's Room"" DVD releases, ""Candyland"" and I believe a ""My Little Pony"" release.

Dora the Explorer - ""The Lost City"" --- Dora and her friends search for Dora's lost teddy bear. Newer episode featuring ""star-catching."" I don't really think much of this show, due to the extreme level of repetition, mainly. I know it is pretty popular, though.

Blue's Clues - ""The Legend of the Blue Puppy"" - This is good one. In this episode from the sixth season featuring Joe, viewers learn about Blue's origins. They find out that Blue has a key to a special playroom where she can talk. Thus, viewers are introduced to Blue's Room.

LazyTown - ""Sports Day"" - This is excellent. ""LazyTown"" is fairly new to Nick Jr. and is a great, active show. In this episode, Robbie Rotten is up to his usual tricks --- trying to get the kids to be lazy and also trying to ban Sportacus from LazyTown forever. He challenges them all to a race and then plays a mean trick to sap Sportacus of his energy.

Little Bill - ""Little Bill's Adventure with Captain Brainstorm"" - This is a great show, but I don't get to watch it nearly as much as I'd like. In this one, Little Bill and his friends go to meet their TV hero Captain Brainstorm ""live and in person."" Little Bill gets scared and bails out of the meeting. He then shares with his friends a story he wrote about him going on an adventure with Captain Brainstorm. The story has a great lesson about making friends and helps to give Little Bill confidence.

Max and Ruby - ""Max's Work of Art / Max Meets Morris / Ruby's Scavenger Hunt"" - Three stories from the show. I like a lot of Rosemary Well's work and the TV shows based on it, but this one just doesn't cut it for me. Max is a little scamp and both of them could really benefit from some adult help.

Oswald - ""A Day at the Beach / Sand Sculpture Contest"" - Oswald is a sweet, calming show. In these two stories, Oswald tries to get his good friend Henry to swim with him at the beach. Then he becomes the judge of a sand sculpture contest, but has trouble deciding on a winner.

Overall, a pretty decent set of shows, but could benefit with some special features and better presentation. I really believe that DVDs these days must have good special features or at least try at them in order to be rated higher.",1134518400,15,2629,4.353061224489796
8059897,4,B0009F3EP4,"I was so happy to find this DVD.  It has all of my son's favorites in one.  We have a DVD player in the car and he's always asking for Dora, Blue and Lazytown.  I'll be on the look out for more DVD's like this one.",1122076800,2,214,3.608695652173913
