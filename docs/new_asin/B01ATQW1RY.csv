8748441,5,B01ATQW1RY,"We loved this series when it debuted in the 80's. We have tried to get this series on DVD for years, even calling the BBC.  We had an almost unwatchable VHS recording we made back in the 80's but we were afraid the frequent viewing would cause it to self-destruct.  Hooray for the BBC.  Better late than never!",1491350400,2,310,4.310344827586207
