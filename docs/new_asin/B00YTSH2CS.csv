8719223,5,B00YTSH2CS,"One of the first series in the rotating anthology ""The Bold Ones"" on NBC, ""The Protectors"" was a cop show with a difference. Not entirely dissimilar from the earlier, wonderful ""Naked City"" at the beginning of the 1960s, this show also used the cop show format to examine moral & cultural issues of the day -- in this case, the end of the 1960s. And there was a lot to examine!

While the DVD set won't come out until September, when I'll add a review of the image quality & any extras, I have recently seen the series on one of those retro-TV channels, so the episodes are fresh in my mind. Rather than using a musical score, the natural sounds of the city provided the soundtrack, and each story was bookended by voiceovers from a call-in radio program, with various opinions (often intense) on the issues -- an urban Greek chorus. Leslie Nielsen & Hari Rhodes starred -- Nielsen as a more conservative chief of police, and Rhodes as a more liberal DA -- often butting heads but still respecting one another. For those familiar with Nielsen solely as a comic actor, his dramatic abilities will come as a welcome surprise -- he's very good!

Let me comment on a couple of episodes to give the flavor of the short-lived show.

""A Thing Not of God"" -- A pair of soldiers kidnaps a deserter from their squad from a local church, where he's been given sanctuary by a radical priest, whom they beat severely. The deserter is a young man with serious questions about the Vietnam War & whether he should participate in it. The episode looks at all sides -- the caring, patriotic father of the soldier, who doesn't quite understand what's going on; the crisis of conscience for both the priest & a nun in his church; the mixed, outraged reaction of the public; the limits & the demands of authority, law, and genuine moral doubt. It's a fairly accurate portrait of the times, quite daring for network TV.

""If I Should Wake Before I Die"" -- a convicted rapist/killer has become a noted author while in prison, an example of rehabilitation ... or is that just a pose? Sentenced to death, he demands & gets an re-examination of his case in court. The questions: Can a criminal truly redeem himself? If so, what are his obligations to society? What about the victims & their families? Is the death penalty moral? Again, all sides are given a voice. This is a powerful episode, with an ending like a punch in the gut.

The show only lasted a few episodes, and that's a pity, because it had so much potential. The only good thing that came out of its cancellation was its replacement by an even better (if equally short-lived) show, ""The Senator"" with Hal Holbrook (reviewed previously). Both were examples of a brief moment in network TV when quality had the edge over empty distraction & escapism. Recommended!

Edit -- 9/19/2015 -- Having received & watched my DVD set of ""The Protectors"" a couple of days ago, I can add that there are no extras, though the set does include the pilot film as well as the handful of episodes that aired. There's a disclaimer at the beginning stating that the best available video source was used, meaning that the picture quality of the episodes is reasonably good for a TV series from that period -- just don't look for HD quality here, folks!

That goes even more so for the pilot film ""Deadlock"" -- as with ""The Senator"" segment of ""The Bold Ones"" the pilots seem to be in worse shape than the episodes. ""Deadlock"" has noticeable green lines & dancing green artifacts in some scenes. And on my copy, the aspect ratio was squeezed even tighter than the traditional TV screen ratio; fortunately, switching to Zoom fixed that problem, creating a semi-widescreen look. But definitely no remastering or cleaning.

The story, however, remains taut & gritty, remarkably so for that time & still powerful today. Very few TV shows then were willing to deal with the racial divide in anything remotely approaching an honest way. ""Deadlock"" often looks & feels like a documentary; some of the footage is clearly contemporary news footage of the inner city. The roughness of the print actually contributes to the overall atmosphere, though that wasn't the intention.

That said, I rather like the look of the show, with its period lighting & experimental visuals. They might look crude to a generation raised on a more detailed & subtle style of storytelling, but the best TV shows of that era have a certain visceral, heartfelt punch to them. The writers were dealing with issues of the day -- of the moment -- and there have been very few periods when so much was happening so intensely on a daily basis. Again, for some younger viewers, a mental adjustment may be necessary to enter into the mindset of the times; but on the whole, I think it's worth making the effort. This is solid work!",1438300800,18,4807,4.626025791324736
