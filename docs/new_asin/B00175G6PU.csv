3167275,1,B00175G6PU,"Creatively, if Karl L. is a 10, the director of this movie is a minus 0.
First, the hand-held camera work is the worst in the history of cinema (it makes your head spin and your stomach turn); the use of Baroque background music is in the style of the most banal French television documentary; 25% of the film is wasted on ocean views, sky views, city views, views through a car windshield, and there is even a long long take of an open window with no-one there (the top of KL's head bobs up once or twice; the narrator's questions to KL are usually so superficial and idiotic that even KL criticizes them on film; the narrator is clearly embarrassed by homosexuality and KL is clearly irritated by the generally bourgeois frame of mind of the interviewer (AND it is distinctly the bourgeois that KL hates above all, as witnessed during the few insightful moments of this film).  KL comes off as a determined, confident, gifted guy, and with a disarming sense of humor and humanity.  Ultimately, one feels, there is something in ordinary human life, and in people, that fills him with absolute dread and revulsion.  This is interesting and doesn't get enough treatment, though KL is very happy to talk about it at length. One strength of the film, and probably unconscious on the part of the director, is that the world KL moves through has a great ordinariness and deadness about it: essentially unappealing decors of his homes; settings for his fashion shows that feel like a hip nightclub around closing time, when everything is dirty, tired, spent, and smelling of stale liquor. Essentially, KL's world is not glamorous, and he is honest enough to admit to it. It's an existence that has most appeal in the photograph of it, edited and digitally corrected to the max.  In short, it's a tough, creative, determined existence, resulting in an extreme accomplishment, but dead somewhere at an essential core.  Another plus of the film is, that KL comes across as honest, smart, with a clear personal philosophy, a wonderful sense of humor, and a ready laugh. He'd be a fascinating guy to know, warm, fun, completely unconventional, and brutally honest.  Finally, this film is a huge failure: the director just cannot even approach the fascinating reality of KL.  A great opportunity missed, because KL is honest and isn't afraid to talk about himself meaningfully. But, in the last analysis, he lacks something.  Something that, for instance, St. Laurent had -- as an artist and as a person -- that is of a greatly superior dimension, one that is fundamentally estranged from the person KL is.",1239667200,15,2594,4.787472035794184

3167279,5,B00175G6PU,"Karl Lagerfeld is that rare narcissist whose narcissism seems entirely justified.  He probably is almost always the most interesting person in the room.  His reference points are usually his own thoughts and events in his life.  He seems to be his own best friend.

""Lagerfeld Confidential"" is all about Karl Lagerfeld or more precisely, it's all about Karl's views on everything.  The visual focus is on the beauty and drama that seem to surround him wherever he goes.  The entire film seems to have been filmed either at night or in the partial sunlight of dawn.

We see him in his Parisian Chateau rearranging his books and drawing a dress.  Then he's on a corporate jet on the way to Monaco. Then he's at a modern dance performance.  Several times we see him at fashion shows completely unperturbed by the hysteria swirling around him.  He's not a detail guy.  The fashion show that he dreamed is especially thrilling and gorgeous.  And there's lots of footage of him in cars always in the right hand front seat and never driving.  We don't have to be told that he would never waste his beautiful mind on something as trivial as driving.  Then he's suddenly in Italy greeting the house staff in Italian but he sticks mostly to French with the occasional greeting or command in English.  We never hear him speak German.

From the photo shoot footage, we can presume that he prefers early morning light and young, thin, slightly muscular male models.  The only things he seems attached to are books and, we see stacks of them everywhere.  His Parisian Chateau is especially full of books but he apparently has warehouse space for his library and other papers.  The final journey is to New York where we find out that he's bought a house that's ""not ready yet.""  Will he live there?  ""My home's wherever I am.""

The playful relationship he has with Rodolphe Marconi is sweet and fun to watch.  The basic rhythm between them is that Rodolphe asks a question.  Karl then makes a poke at the question or the way it was asked and, we start to think he's not going to answer it.  But then he starts to dance around it and eventually starts digging until he makes a final point that is often quite profound and memorable.  We hear his views on people who cannot be alone (he cannot tolerate them), co habitation (it's not for him), marriage (pathetic) and prostitution (a good and perhaps necessary thing.)

He talks about being sexually active at 11 or 12 and then being ""assaulted"" at the age of 13 by both a man and a woman.  When he went to his mother about this she blamed him, essentially telling him that it was his fault for acting like a tart and, he should tone it down.  He seems to have thought at the time that she was right and his views have not changed on this matter.  We don't find out if he stopped acting like a tart.  One of many lines of questioning that I wish had been followed a little farther.

We hear about his idiosyncrasies such as needing to hold the pillow (now in a protective cover) that his nanny made him when he flies.  Yes this is a very old pillow.  His drawings are always finished with a frame drawn around the borders of the paper.

We gather that he would be a generous and entertaining friend but shouldn't be surprised if he suddenly stopped returning our phone calls.  Ditto for business associate.

Karl always gives the crowd the legendary Karl Lagerfeld when the time is right and does a full leisurely strut down the catwalk and back.  His disapproval of the sort of designer who in T-shirt and jeans sheepishly peeks out from behind the curtain at the end of a show probably also sweating, looking frazzled and holding a pincushion seems entirely right.  Why should the designer get away with making an anti fashion statement with his personal appearance?

Karl is so thoroughly engrossing that one could almost forget how well done this movie is.  It is in fact very well done.  Marconi has a great eye for the minutiae that surrounds Karl and for organizing the movie visually around the themes his questions suggest.  If we're not listening to the playful back and forth between Karl and Rodolphe, we're listening to all sorts of wonderful music.  And ultimately we're left feeling and seeing that Karl's life is about beauty and art, both creation and appreciation, rather than just fashion.",1213228800,10,4341,4.603650586701434

3167281,5,B00175G6PU,"I understand that many are critical of Lagerfeld, and rightfully so, as he has a way with words that may either entertain or irk the inner-reccesses of your psyche. He is a genius. He is arrogant. I guess the top in most fields will have some twist to their unique character that enabling them to propel with new visions - or borrowed modified in new light.

I think that the movies, personally is entertaining. I like the strong character seeing some of the ""ignorant"" views from the bubble of praise he must live in - and deserves. I respect his work, I like his tongue that offends many. Others it motivates. I am in the second category.

The question, for you, is why are you viewing this. If you are interested in fashion, fashion design, or autobiography like documentaries I think this will be of interest to you. If the tilt is mainly fashion I would recommend this regardless if whether you like him or not - it is a good way to see a segment of the high-end industry and how it works for the successful, somehow. If your favourite viewing genres are more mainstream and politically correct - you may want to look elsewhere.

This gets a five from me, as it is brilliant. Even the irksome arrogance he speaks of is often lined with truth. The perspective matters. Think well - of you buy - enjoy it for what it is. It is unique.",1390521600,3,1337,4.4048582995951415
3167282,3,B00175G6PU,"Maybe Lagerfeld Confidential is not the right title for this documentary. The entire film is an up-close, straightforward portrayal of Karl Lagerfeld, to be sure, but for anyone who is looking for an in-depth look into what made him one of the most influential icons in the fashion world, Rodolphe Marconis documentary would seem superficial.

You will not learn much about the personal history or career of Karl Lagerfeld, or the wide variety of his works. The documentary film looks like bits of footage about the designer working and talking, all pieced together at random. You are going to see inside his mansion, and witness how he draws, surrounded by stacks of books, or how he works with Nicole Kidman for a Chanel photo shoot, and so on, but not much that is really interesting.

But Karl Lagerfeld himself is something different. He talks before the camera about his childhood and his philosophies of life, and these bits themselves are pretty interesting partly because of the way in which Lagerfeld speaks. You are not perfectly sure who he is or what he really thinks, but you know he is acting out the role of Karl Lagerfeld, and he does it perfectly.

After all this is a film about Karl Lagerfeld, a sharp-witted man who has successfully remained an elusive figure. Probably thats what he wants, and he does it very well. Superficial as it is, at least Lagerfeld Confidential shows that.",1389657600,2,1403,4.813278008298755

So, not a single question? Instead the filmmaker minced around like a junior high school nerd on the ""question"" of the designer's sexual orientation? Terribly boring and tedious.

3401785,2,B00175G6PU,"No plot, no concrete idea, but merely a dvd on bits and pieces of Lagerfeld's luxurious life.
With his charisma, talent, wits and a substantial contribution to fashion, Lagerfeld definitely deserves a far better documentary.",1263340800,,224,5.428571428571429

8264823,3,B00175G6PU,"It would be difficult to come away from watching this and not like him more than you might expect, and the fact that he's so relentlessly 'un PC' is a part of his charm. I thought his frankness regarding his relentless promiscuity as a young boy was really refreshing, It doesn't have the depth that the great doco on 'Valentino, The Last Emperor' has, but they are worlds apart. If you;'re looking for class, Valentino wipes Karl Lagerfeld and his dirty adolescent jokes, right off the map. He's cheap, and more than a little sad. It's interesting, but as shallow and vacuous as he is. The scenes with him fawning over a handsome male model, are revealing. Which one needs the other the most?",1496620800,,693,4.596774193548387

8264826,3,B00175G6PU,"In this documentary we see the super driven legendary fashion designer, couturier and photographer Karl Lagerfeld, a true original if ever there was one. He of the white hair tied back into a ponytail, dark glasses, the chunky rings on all fingers, and the quasi-clerical collars; a look that Lagerfeld has cultivated and polished for decades.

We see Lagerfelds chaotic Paris apartment, we go backstage with him at a big show, into a studio for a photo shoot, and we travel with him on his many rides in a Gulfstream private jet, presumably paid for by his employer, Chanel.

We see Lagerfeld kissing Nicole Kidman on both cheeks at a Chanel event like he created her. On the rare occasion Lagerfeld is interviewed one-on-one, he is droll, mischievous, enlightening and intelligent. But sadly these interviews only account for a few minutes of the film; the rest is fly-on-the-wall stuff; although we don't get to see much fashion.

There really are no revealing moments in this documentary; you really don't feel you have learned anything about the man. In fact Lagerfeld's mannerisms and stage-props appear like a kind of haute couture armour which makes any form of intimacy with him impossible. As an haute couture designer, Lagerfeld is one of the few left from the golden age and oh what he could teach and tell us all about that time. But he does not appear at all sentimental about the past living very much in the moment, he is forward looking. Onward and upward as they say!",1445731200,,1485,4.79296875

8264829,3,B00175G6PU,"He walks through the room as if nothing fazes him. He talks as though he's got everything figured out. Like many artistic geniuses, Karl Lagerfeld is not bound by societal constrictions or by industry standards.

""Lagerfeld Confidential"" is a lackey's attempt at showcasing a key figure of the fashion world. As a viewer, you get the feeling that the filmmaker is intimidated by his subject. The camera often follows the back of Lagerfeld's head as he nonchalantly weaves his way through a crowd. When we do get a view of his face, the filmmaker plies him with sheepish questions about his sexuality or questions that have little to do with his passions. We get snippets of childhood memories and samples of his philosophical stance. Twice we get to see him at his desk, marker in hand, rapidly firing out illustrations for his newest creations. We also see him in his element as a serious photographer. As much as I enjoy watching his chic ponytailed head floating about, so much footage is wasted with these tag-along shots which make this less of a confidential and more of an undeveloped portrait.",1427587200,2,1101,4.825396825396825
