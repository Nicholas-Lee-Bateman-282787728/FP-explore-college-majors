7911071,3,B00000IO4O,"Es una excelente produccion que representa dignamente a los msicos mexicanos contemporaneos.
Cada quiene tiene criterios diferentes, y en mi caso lo nico que no me gust es que'l Alex Lora se adorn como de costumbre con algunas majaderas y maldiciones, pero que le vamos a hacer!!?? es parte de su personalidad y a fin de cuentas el objetivo es disfrutar unas buenas rolas.",1302134400,,372,4.828125
7911072,5,B00000IO4O,"Este es sin duda alguna el mejor concierto en vivo de la banda El Tri. Aqui la banda legendaria es acompanada por la Sinfonica Filarmonica Metropolitana, asi que ya se podran imaginar el arduo trabajo de arreglar las notas, cuerdas, etc. con la sinfonia. Contiene 12 canciones y todas estan excelentemente compuestas sinfonicamente. Lo recomiendo como fan de El Tri.",1264118400,,366,5.116666666666666
7911073,5,B00000IO4O,"Me parece que el concierto Sinfonico refleja la escencia misma del tri, arreglos muy bien logrados con toda la peculiaridad de su vocalista Alex Lora, excelente desicion para aquellos que no conocen al Tri,  simplemente para los que somos aficionados a este grupo.-
Este DVD no puede faltar en la coleccin de todos aquellos a quienes nos gusta la msica del Tri.-",1082332800,,362,4.838709677419355
7911074,5,B00000IO4O,"Celebrating thirty years of rocnroll, El Tri plays with the Sinfonica FM in an Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City for a historical performance. Leader Alex Lora displays his usual vulgarities enticing the crowd to participate as only he can. He opens the show bad mouthing those unable to attend and solicits an immediate chorus of ""culero"" that will be heard again for an encore in typically Mexican style. The pairing of the symphony with a rootsy rocnroll band, equipped with old school bluesy harmonica, as played by Rafael Salgado and led by veterano Alex Lora, with his raspy voiced social politial messages, is a brilliant fusion of beautiful finesse and raw energy. Only El Tri has the crass and support of it's loyal fans to in one breath echar malhabladas and in the next pay homage in song to La Virgen de Guadalupe by singing the poetic and wonderful ""Virgen Morena"" to open the concert. The hour plus footage captured here is represenative of the fantasic show El Tri puts on as I can testify after having seen them on several occassions throughout their illustrious career. El Tri is a peoples band and the people respond as such, joinng in in chorus and at times even dominating the vocals of Lora to the point where he bows out and lets the audience take over. The symphony is a marvelous touch that gives the thirty year celebration a touch of class despite the bands stance as the antithesis of class. The sound is magnificnet and sounds super on a home system equipped with good speakers for an experience that captures the essence of that live night back in October of 1998. The backdrop stage imagery is complete with a banner of Che and others including a satirical image of former President Salinas. Alex Lora is constantly speaking to the crowd in the way that only he can with his ""me vale madre y que chingen a su madre a los que no le gusta la musica de El Tri."" There are 12 songs performed here that are good examples of the many they have recorded throughout the years. It must have been no easy task to pick so few songs but the ones picked are all superb with no weaknesses. All the songs are great but my top three favorites would be ""Virgen Morena"", ""Nostalgia"" and ""Triste Cancion."" Although the totality of this concert is what makes it so good extra kudos should be given to the Director of the Orchestra, Eduardo Munozdiaz as well as the fine violin playing by invited guest Zbigniew Paleta. The performance is complete with the addition of Alex's wife Chela on stage as her persona is his mirrored in the opposite sex. Conceptually this a brilliant video and the crowd should get as much credit as the Sinfonica FM  and El Tri, as it is a synergistic relationship that makes the end product even better. Highly recommended for roceros of all ages. There is a CD version of this conert as well but the problem with that is one's senses are missing the whole picture. See the video, it was a magical night where artists and audience became one. Como grita Alex Lora ""Que viva rocnroll!!!""",995932800,5,3024,4.589648798521257
