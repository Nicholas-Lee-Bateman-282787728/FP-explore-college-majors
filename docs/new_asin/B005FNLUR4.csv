4683595,3,B005FNLUR4,"First, this movie is okay.  Second, it DOES NOT STAR TOM HARDY!.  He has about 15 sec of airtime as a mechanic.  That's it!  If you're only buying it because of TH, save your coins.  This would have been a great movie if he had been the star.  He's a much better actor than the guy w/the lead.",1433808000,6,293,3.9655172413793105

4683597,5,B005FNLUR4,"nice  HARD TIMES  homage  with a COCKNEY TWIST.

I enjoyed this bare knuckle tale of redemption with a cockney twist.

WUCHINSKI the protagonist got sucker punched-knocked cold-face stomped by his opponent THE MACHINE.

It is a long road back.  WUCHINSKI hooks up with HARLEY the sleezy promoter with a soft side.  WEED the quirky, chemically dependent trainer. And, a couple of bimbos in minor roles but not bad to look at.

A bunch of cage matches and wagers are held.  Lots of bare knuckles and some macho posturing  and wagers are staged.  The  fact that this is all held in sleezy locations in England makes for some cool arm chair travel slumming  adventures.

One reviewer complained  this aint nuthin' but a redo of BRONSON's HARD TIMES...BUT THAT AINT BAD IMHO..HT was classic...and BRONSON never got face  stomped and had no limey accent.

In summary, a cool cage fight limey  indy flick.  An excellent  cameo by ANTONIO FARGAS-(HUGGY BEAR THE PIMP from  BARETTA).

I watched this on AMAZON PRIME so i have a low barrier to entertainment ...but this flick...me likee mucho. Guys only.  Don't let wifey see you watching...or she'll think you are a beast.  View on the down low.",1414800000,,1186,4.81

4683599,3,B005FNLUR4,"This is a remake of Charles Bronson's best movie, ""Hard Times"", about a man-with-no-name, down-and-outer who arrives out of nowhere in New Orleans during the Great Depression and then proceeds to make some badly needed fast money with pick-up fights.  It was a 1975 release starring James Coburn, Martin (""What we have here is a failure to communicate"") Strother, Jill Ireland, and, of course, Charles Bronson.  As with most remakes, 'Sucker Punch' is nowhere near as good as the original.  I give Hard Times 4 or 5 stars and definitely recommend it if you can find it.  It is especially appropriate in light of our second Great Depression (that we are not supposed to call a great depression).

The remake is worth watching as a sort of evidentiary documentation of how much more corrupt and violent our society and culture have become.  Just like many others of today's movies compared to their predecessors, the acting is worse, the violence more graphic and overboard, and the characters more perverse...proof positive that newer is not necessarily better.

The movie's one saving grace is its main character who is a much better person than the world he is stuck in.",1411257600,,1171,4.913705583756345
4683600,1,B005FNLUR4,"I didn't like the movie and only bought it due to Tom Hardy being listed as an actor in the movie. He is lieterally in the movie for maybe 1 minute at most. Poor story, bad acting, crap movie.",1359331200,11,192,3.948717948717949
4683601,1,B005FNLUR4,"Terrible cinematography, slow paced, and boring movie. It looks like it was someone's sophomore college project. I think I spent a dollar on the movie, and I feel like I got robbed.",1332115200,2,181,4.6875
4683602,2,B005FNLUR4,"""I might be wrong, but I'm guessing you know something that I don't."" A struggling fight promoter Ray 'Harley' Davidson (Fargas) is running out of money and respect in town. When he meets Charles Buchinsky (Alexander) he thinks he found his way back to the top. If you absolutely love UFC and street fighting you will like this. If you love watching street fighting you will like this. If you enjoy watching movies like that but aren't totally psyched about them then this may be a struggle to get through. I have seen worse, but I'm pretty sure the budget was around 100 bucks. The fighting was pretty fake, the acting was not good, but again, if you like movies like this that doesn't matter. This movie was made a few years ago, and like ""Bending All The Rules"" is only now coming out because an actor who is in it for five minutes (Tom Hardy in this one) is hot right now. Overall, a movie for people that love this kind of thing. If, like me, you think a few are OK then I would look for something else. I give it a C-.

Would I watch again? - No, I almost didn't make it through once.

*Also try - Fighting & Locked Down",1318723200,4,1126,4.232558139534884
8470341,1,B005FNLUR4,"Where is Tom Hardy?????? This movie was so stupid and the actors sucked and the guy couldn't fight for sh*t.  Also, the director of the movie sucked and the filming of it sucked, it was like someone videotaped a video.  I'm sorry I usually enjoy most of the movies I see on Amazon but this one was bad.  Plus I have been a Prime Member for a few years and while I am happy you put more movies for Prime, I would be fair if you charge nothing for movies that are over a year old.  I've already seen some of the movies that are on here.  Just my opinion.  One more thing, I own most of the dvds of Tom Hardy.  I have also seen Taboo Season 1 for free on T.V. why do we have to pay for it?  Also the movie Locke (which is not one of Tom's best movies) but it's not on Prime, I'm supposed to spend $4.99 for a movie that I've seen already on TWC/Spectrum?  Thanks for listening.  But if anyone even prime members think Tom Hardy the read ""Tom Hardy"" is not in this film.  All unknowns, and made extremely bad.  Thank you.",1496188800,2,1017,4.0049751243781095
