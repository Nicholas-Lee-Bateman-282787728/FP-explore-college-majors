8457113,3,B0054U1VTK,"Have to agree with laborious detail review.  Exercises seem excellent, but I was looking for a way to fast forward after the initial time or two, as it seems there are just a few exercises and it takes 45 minutes to get through it.",1448755200,,231,4.25
8457114,1,B0054U1VTK,"This is a very laborious detailed explanation about various exercise movements.  If you're looking for an actual work and still want time to ride your horse  I suggest one of the Ballet Barre videos, Sadie Lincolns are my favorite.",1429488000,,231,4.897435897435898

8457116,5,B0054U1VTK,"Best exercises for specific muscles used during horse back riding.  I have read Mary Wanless's books, but couldn't quite get it until I did the exercises on the DVD's.  Muscle memory is developed.  Until you do the excises & strengthen the deep muscles needed & the stretches; you won't be able to perform what u read about.  I can do the stretch exercise DVD, then effortlessly sit in the correct position on the horse.  For a 60 yr. Old with stiffening & shortening of ligaments & tendons it's not easy to find that right position effortlessly, so am very grateful for these DVD's.",1338854400,13,583,4.621359223300971
8457117,5,B0054U1VTK,"I really love this workout. Every time I follow one of the four DVDs I can feel direct results. Each stretch is explained in detail and the trainer shows pictures of the muscles that are involved in the stretch. This helps to really understand what its about, and to do the stretchs correctly. I also like that the women who shows the stretchs is a very normal looking lady.
The great thing about this workout is that there is a direct link to riding. I find that I can follow instructions from my riding teacher that before just seemed impossible to do. Also my general mobility has improved, for example I can now much easier sit through the galop.
My only problem is that I really have to DO the workouts, to find the time and follow through. Some of the stretchs are horrible when you're in them, but after the whole workout I always have this feeling of wellbeing and am totally relaxed. So it is really worth it.
And much more effective than anything I have tried out so far.",1333065600,9,981,4.395604395604396
