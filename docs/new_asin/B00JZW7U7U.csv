8654714,5,B00JZW7U7U,"I purchased the set of 3 DVD of this ""You Can Do It"" set and am very happy with them.  You can see a trailer on Denise's website.  The location is a contemporary building interior (mainly white) and Denise is wearing bright and happy colours.  Music is typical canned music. The workout is a good all-over workout with dumbbells, easy for anybody to follow.  Make it harder by increasing the weight as you progress.",1403654400,3,415,4.5675675675675675
