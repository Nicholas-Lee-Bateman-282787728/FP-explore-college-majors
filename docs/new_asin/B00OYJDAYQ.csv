8685350,5,B00OYJDAYQ,"This dvd is exactly what the world of stand up needs. Not your typical burp and fart jokes, Gary tackles subjects that are relevant. He is a breath of fresh air in a room full of broccoli farts. If you only plan on buying one dvd this year, make sure that it's ""Lights, Camera, Loser"". Not only was the material great, the name of the dvd is in my opinion the greatest I have ever seen. ""Lights, Camera, Loser"". Gary is anything but a loser. Some would even say he is a king.",1417219200,,475,4.118279569892473
8685351,5,B00OYJDAYQ,"Gary is not only funny, he is also overflowing with sex appeal. I missed a few of the jokes because I was laughing too hard to hear them. If you like to laugh, then you owe it to yourself to buy this dvd. Ladies, even if this isn't your style of comedy, you will still enjoy this dvd. Just light a candle, turn off the volume, play a little Barry White and let your mind take you where ever your heart desires while just gazing at the sample of masculine perfection that is Gary Parkings.",1417219200,,488,4.147368421052631
8685352,5,B00OYJDAYQ,"Somewhere in Nowhere, Gary is telling his dry wit. Now I look up everyday, waiting for a bird to poop on me! Well worth the purchase and watching.",1416614400,,146,4.25
8685353,5,B00OYJDAYQ,"This DVD is like cheap gin. If you aren't careful, it WILL kill you but if you treat it right, then oh my is it ever good. Gary is like a coked up young Steven Wright, if Steven Wright did cocaine. He has a very warped way of looking at the world. With a deadpan delivery, hilariously dubbed laugh track, and hair that rivals that guy from Ancient Aliens, Gary takes the viewer down a dark, weird alleyway that leads right to his picked brain. Gary's comedy is like Sugar Ray Leonard: fast on his feet and you never know which way he is going! (I am willing to bet in an actual boxing match Gary would totally knock Sugar Ray Leonard out).
There are 17 different bits on this DVD, which runs over an hour. Some of the material is...odd (Vaccines, The Bus Ride, Cakewalk) and some are rather thought provoking (World Peace, Grandma, The Mold Maker). But they are all funny.

is it worth the $9.99 price? Yes it is, its obvious Gary has a lot of love and passion for comedy, and passion like this needs to be rewarded. You will have to watch this a few times to get all the material, but it is worth it.",1415577600,,1101,4.218009478672986
8685354,4,B00OYJDAYQ,"Odd, yet very funny. Gary has a unique view of the world that is infectious. Not like Ebola of course. Maybe more like a stomach flu.",1415491200,2,133,4.153846153846154
