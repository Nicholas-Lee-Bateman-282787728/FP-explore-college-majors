5679156,5,B00BW7ZMAS,"Awsome to have these movies packaged together and the quality is very good on High Def even though it is not BluRay.  Great sound.  My only beef is why leave out a film?  The other Bond collections are in order with one missing on the end, but this set is missing one in between movie one and two.  Strange to do it this way.

5679160,5,B00BW7ZMAS,"Brosnan's Bond is credited for saving the franchise from the malaise that the series suffered from ""Moonraker"" through ""Licence to Kill"". Welcomed enthusiastically by the public and widely mourned when he departed the series, ""The Billion Dollar Bond"" brought fun, menace and presence to the all-but-dead series in the form of four (yep, that's FOUR) terrific movies. As good as ""Goldeneye is (and it is very good), it was the second Brosnan film, ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", that returned the series fully to its former glory. A crazy villain, evil henchman, some of the best chases in the series, fun rapport between Bond, Moneypenny and Q, a more fully realized relationship between Bond and M, an ultra-cool bad guy lair, noirish segments, a great score and real Bond girls in Teri Hatcher and Michelle Yeoh. So, why is this movie missing from the set? This is no ""ultimate"" set at all, but a slap in the face to Brosnan's considerable Bond legacy.",1359417600,12,947,4.888198757763975
5679161,4,B00BW7ZMAS,How can this be Pierce Brosnan ULTIMATE if it doesn't have all the movies?  It's missing TOMORROW NEVER DIES. Someone didn't do their homework.,1359331200,58,143,4.958333333333333
5679162,5,B00BW7ZMAS,"While it's really hard to say who is the best James Bond ever, I know who my favorite is. While I freaking love Sean Connery and Roger Moore, Pierce Brosnan is my favorite James Bond mostly because he was the one I grew up with. His movies exposed me to the 007 movies and I've been a fan since. So I owe Pierce (and my Dad who's a huge bond fan) for introducing me to the series. Ever since MGM came out with the Sean Connery 007 collection. There was no doubt they would come out with a collection of the Pierce Brosnan films. It's great that they finally came out with it, but the only include three of his four films. The film that is missing from this collection is ""Tomarrow Never Dies"" which was a great movie. Still, the three movies that are in this set are great movies and they are worth it.

Goldeneye (1995)- Possibly the best movie of this set. Goldeneye was Pierce's first time as Bond and he does a great job stepping out of the shadow of both Connery and Moore. This film was also directed by Martin Campbell who would later direct Casino Royale which ironically would be Daniel Craig's first Bond movie. This was the first Bond movie I saw in theaters and it holds a good place in my love for the bond films. From the begining of the film where 007 and 006 infiltrate the Soviet chemical weapons facility to the climax where James and Alec fight on the hidden satellite dish, this film is a BLAST!!! The action scenes are fantasic and creative. The characters do things you wouldn't count one like Bond driving a tank in a great car chase scene. All the actors do a fine job as well. Sean Bean was great as Alec Trevlyan, the 00 agent gone bad. He was like a mere shadow of Bond and Alec gives you the impression of what it could be like if Bond worked for the terroists. It was rare to see a Bond villain end up being an old friend of James Bond and this film pulls it off well. Of course we have the Bond girls as well.  Izabella Scorupco as Natalya Simonova was really good. She was a strong woman who knew how to follow her instincts and she made a good par to go along with Bond. Famke Janssen as the sadist Xenia Onatopp was darn crazy in a good way. She was a character who enjoyed pain in that werid sort of way. She may rank as one of the best evil Bond girls along with Caroline Munro's Naomi (The Spy who Loved me) to name a few. But my favorite character was Boris Grishenko played by Alan Cumming. A crazy and slezy hacker who was a a former co-worker of Natalya and now works for Alec. His line ""I AM INVINCIBLE!"" always caught on to me and I always found myself saying that line anytime I beat a hard game.

The World is Not Enough (1999)- This was actually the third James Bond film to star Pierce Brosnan. This film was also unfortunately the final time Desmond Llewelyn would play Q before his death. After this film, John Cleese (who appears in this film as well as R) would fill in the role in the next flick.  This films had a really great revenge story to it with the main villains trying to take down MI6 after previous unseen mission. Sophie Marceau was fantasic as Elektra King, young woman who was once innocent but is now twisted thanks to her former captors and MI6's previous use of her. She has that innocent look in her eyes that make you want to hug her, but holds a dark secret behind those eyes. Robert Carlyle was also great as Renard, the main villain. He plays a man on the verge of death trying to give the world one last punch to the face before he dies with the bulliet that's stuck in his brain. Denise Richards was decent as bond girl Dr. Jones (Not Indiana Jones). She was a character that was able to hold her own in certain events, but I couldn't really see Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist. Hey, it's more believeible than Tara Reid as a scientist in ""Alone in the Dark."" Once again, the action scenes are fantastic. The begining boat chase was possibly my favorite action scene in the movie with Bond pretty much destroying everything with Q's boat. I also loved the action scene in the nuclear plant with Bond barly esacping an expoltion in the tunnel.

Die Another Day (2002)- This film seems to get a very bad rep by many critics and fans. I'll admit, it's possibly the cheeseist of the Pierce Brosnan films and it has some silly moments like the main villain who changed his appearance from a Korean to a British man and it's over use of CGI. But personally, I actually enjoyed this film for some of that stuff. It was almost like a throwback to the classic Bond films. Most notibly the laser torture scene was a tribute to Golderfinger. The opening scene was also very shocking to me because I've never seen James Bond get caught and tortured the way he was in this film. It's also crazy how that was all at the start. But othe main attraction in this film (and was the most marketed) was Hallie Berry as the led Bond girl, Jinx. She was a spanky and smart woman who truly knew how to handle herself without Bond. Hallie Berry was great in the role (great looking too) and I think she should go down as one of the best Bond girls. Rosamund Pike as also fine as evil Bond girl Miranda Frost, but the twist of her character wasn't shocking since it almost became a tradtion at this point with the Brosnan films. Two Bond girls, one good and one bad. Toby Stephens was fine as the led villain, but he was possibly the most cartoony of the Brosnan films with a cartoonish method of his plans. The action scenes are always worth it alone with the car chase in the middle of the ice lake being the main highlight.

Overall, this is a must buy collection for those who don't own any of the Pierce Brosnan 007 films. The only real downside is the fact that they didn't include ""Tomarrow Never Dies"" which was the 2nd film of this series. If you are a fan of Pierce Brosnan's 007 films like I am, ths is for you. I also recommend getting both of the Sean Connery and Roger Moore 007 collections if you don't already.",1357689600,23,5983,4.271604938271605

5679195,2,B00BW7ZMAS,"If these were tv movies, they would be acceptable. Otherwise, they're the worst James Bond movies with the possible exceptions of Moonraker and a couple others. Pale carbon copies of older outings and other action films, terrible actresses, terrible dialogue, painful. If only they could be erased from JB history. Oh well, we have great films now from Mr. Craig and Co.

I feel bad for Pierce Brosnan, he wanted to be Bond so bad and be great that he went along with anything they came up with and he had no ability to elevate the material, by way of acting or creative abilities/input. He should have said no to two of the scripts of the four he made for sure... Goldeneye is the best of the bunch at the level we're talking about here.",1383955200,4,738,4.466666666666667
5679196,5,B00BW7ZMAS,"GOLDENEYE, Pierce Brosnan's first Bond film, is an interesting one. Most noticeable was its score. Eric Serra's score to GOLDENEYE is highly innovative. It is powerful, sensitive and enigmatic. It is a dark score centered on James Bond the man and explores his psyche, his sense for survival and his motivations for getting the job done. Eric Serra's compositions are unlike anything heard in the previous James Bond films of the series. The score still remains highly controversial. James Bond had come up against the Soviets numerous times in the past. In 1995 Soviet Russia was gone. GOLDENEYE was the film that bridged a gap in more ways than one.
Infrequently in an action film series does one of its entries attempt to deal with the persona of its hero with equal intensity as it handles its plot as is the case with THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH. The director of this film tried to show how James Bond develops an obsession for a woman for whom he has become intrigued with, her having been mistreated by British Intelligence, and the effect it has on him. Unfortunately this idea never really comes satisfactorily to fruition, as the essential plot elements are not fully explored. They are forsaken at the expense of some unimaginative action sequences and a protracted additional love interest in the form of Dr. Christmas Jones. All that being said, Pierce Brosnan really has the part of James Bond down to an art and science despite the flaws in the script. TOMORROW NEVER DIES is the best of these three presented here.
TOMORROW NEVER DIES is one of the best of the Bonds. Roger Spottiswoode did a bang-up job as director handling the action sequences and delivering the script's more timely and coherent storyline to the screen. Pierce Brosnan gets down to business and returns to more familiar territory and storytelling in TOMORROW NEVER DIES. This is the only Brosnan-Bond film where the team of M, Moneypenny, Charles Robinson and Q work as a very efficient and cohesive unit. When of the best things to come along in years was composer David Arnold who scored this film. He continued the sound created by John Barry and simultaneously brought the action to a more modern film-making experience. TOMORROW NEVER DIES is one of the best Bond films of the series.",1381536000,3,2272,4.813299232736573
