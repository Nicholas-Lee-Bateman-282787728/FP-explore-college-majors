8002094,4,B0000E6FP6,"An archaeologist (Arthur Dignam) uncovers an ancient aboriginal tomb on an island, causing him to experience visions of an apparent massacre of a tribe by a band of savage whalers. The man's daughter (Penny Cook) becomes involved as well after she begins having similar visions. This all leads to a rather tense and gory climax where the mystery is revealed. THE DREAMING is a tale of ghosts, murder, and possession. A nice little chiller...",1218672000,2,441,4.972972972972973
8002095,3,B0000E6FP6,"Two of my all-time favorite movies ('Nomads' and 'The Last Wave') came immediately to mind during my initial viewing of this film. The reason for this free association was because it was obvious 'The Dreaming' had borrowed liberally from both.

In 'The Dreaming' a doctor (Penny Cook) treats a young aboriginal girl (Kristina Nehm) in a hospital emergency room for some unspecified injury. The girl dies and immediately afterwards the attending doctor begins to have bad dreams and waking visions of a horrible past event in aboriginal history. These threatening images from the Dreamtime involve a group of whalers who came ashore two centuries earlier to rape and murder a defenseless aboriginal tribe. This event formed a taint or stain within the Dreaming. Now incorporated into the spiritual landscape, the evil spirits of these murderers roam about the imaginal realm seeking whom they may destroy. They have set their sights on the poor doctor. (Almost identitcal to the 'Nomads' storyline).

The similarities between this movie and 'The Last Wave' are found not in the storyline but in the visuals. First, the excessive use of rain and dripping water is highly suggestable of Peter Weirs' aboriginal classic. Secondly, the dream sequences are dark, rainsoaked, with hostile images approaching in a slow-motion fashion which again I found reminiscent of this earlier film.

Unfortunately writer/director Mario Andreacchio took the easy way out and turned it into a story of spirit possession, thereby not taking full advantage of the wealth of aboriginal knowledge at his disposal. With a little additional homework he could have given this film a unique Austalian interpretation to these events and made this a much better film.

Not a great movie by any means, but an OK one. It was nice to see Kristina Nehm (Warindji, the aboriginal girl) again. I haven't seen her in anything since her starring role in ""The Fringe Dwellers.""",1122163200,7,1937,5.159235668789809
