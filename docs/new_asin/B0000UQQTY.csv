1946806,1,B0000UQQTY,"I turned 50 a month ago, and have been an avid excerciser for over 15 years, either at home using videos, or at the gym.  I purchased the entire collection, thinking that perhaps I might gain some insight or suggestions on improving or modifying my routines.  These tapes are boring, repetative and frustrating.  I'm thinking perhaps the music was added after each DVD was recorded, since I can't imagine anyone being as rhythmically challenged as these two seem to be. The word ""Keeping"" should be removed from the title, since if you are already fit, these workouts will not keep you there. Actually. there are many other instructors with workouts for beginners that would definitely motivate a person new to excercising to continue working out.  It's a shame, actually, this collection seems to perpetuate the myth that people over 50 need to slow down....I disagree!",1086566400,56,870,4.979310344827586
1946807,4,B0000UQQTY,"There are three DVDs in this set:  Flexibility; Strength; and Aerobics.  All of the exercises are taught by exercise physiologist Robyn Stuhr, and model Cindy Joseph joins in and provides occasional commentary on the exercises, e.g. ""This feels really good,"" or ""I can really feel this stretch.""  Cindy also demonstrates a yoga routine near the end of the Flexibility DVD, although it is a bit hard to follow because there is little narration, just directions printed on the screen as the two women go through the routine.  I couldn't help but notice that when I'm in the 'down dog' position, it's difficult to read the directions on the screen.  Someday soon, I'll just have to memorize the yoga segment.
I've been going through these DVDs for about a month now, one per morning, along with a couple of other exercise videos (a Pilates workout and a Tai Chi video) to round out the week, plus walking in the afternoon, and I've already begun to notice some improvements in my posture and flexibility.  There are some deep bend knee exercises on the Strength and Aerobics DVDs that I can't do--when I was going through physical therapy for my knees, my therapist recommended against them--but Robyn Stuhr usually supplies an alternate exercise for those of us who have experienced problems with various joints.  Keeping fit in my 50s is definitely different than it was in my twenties--no more jogging, for instance, and these DVDs take our changing bodies into account.  Robyn even gives a brief introduction to Kegels during one of the strength routines.
Each DVD begins with an introduction, body basics, workout tips, and a section on 'know your muscles' before it gets into the core routines.  Once you've watched these sections a few times, you will probably want to skip directly to the core routines via the menu.  Each DVD closes with some upbeat, feel-good advice from Lisa Callahan, M.D., author of ""The Fitness Factor,"" and Lillie Shockney, R.N., author of ""Breast Cancer Survivors' Club.""
Equipment needed:  a stretchy Pilates body band; straight-backed chair; hand weights; and a thick book or step to stand on for two of the strength exercises.  The exercises don't take up too much floor space, and I only have to move one easy chair out of the room in order to do all of the routines without banging into anything.
The ""Flexibility"" DVD runs for 81 minutes, with about 65% of the time spent in exercise.
The ""Strength"" DVD runs for 74 minutes, and the ""Aerobics"" DVD runs for 65 minutes with about the same percentage of exercise time versus the 'talking heads' segments.
The background music is soothing, in contrast to the whumpa-whumpa stuff found on many exercise tapes.  The one minor annoyance other than the silent yoga routine was the occasional tricky camera angle.  It's sometimes hard enough to position myself correctly for a particular exercise without having the camera cocking sideways for a shot of the beautiful Cindy, who didn't even start modeling until she was forty-nine.  More power to her, but this is not a modeling session, so next time, keep the camera steady.  Then the rest of us can figure out what she's doing without having to mentally rotate her position through a couple of dimensions!",1079481600,130,3235,4.897435897435898
1946838,1,B0000UQQTY,"Way too much standing there talking. There is so little working out it's completely boring. Maybe someone completely new to exercise will find this helpful, but I bought a CD to do a work out. They also keep saying, ""If this is too much for you, don't do it."" What?! What about, ""Come! You can do it!"" ? It should be titled, ""Keeping fit in your 80's"".",1487030400,3,352,4.268656716417911

1946905,1,B0000UQQTY,"This seemed pretty lame compared to other exercise DVDs.  It's impossible to skip all the chatter and just get to the exercises.  If you just want some encouragement and ideas for moves to do on your own, it might be good for total beginners or if you're just getting back into exercise.  But if you want to exercise to this regularly, these DVDs would drive me crazy.  The navigation options simply don't allow you to progress from one exercise to the next on each DVD without multiple clicks that include the screen pausing at the copyright warning, and then little intro filler videos of the two women. As a result, you're constantly having to stop and click instead of just moving through the program.  Also, I'm in my 60s and in pretty good shape.  These exercises simply weren't rigorous enough for me.",1388275200,9,808,4.654929577464789
1946906,1,B0000UQQTY,"These DVDs are very difficult to follow because the instructor doesn't keep the beat to stay on proper footing. She makes very poor calls of steps and doesn't give clues or step instructions consistently or with the beat.  Sometimes she waits for the following step to integrate a new step or sometimes right then with no transition.  She frustrates me,! Don't bother with her DVDs.  I personally like Kathy Smith.  She is a great instructor and has been around for ages!!",1378166400,6,472,4.790123456790123
1946907,5,B0000UQQTY,Working at my own pace is great. The DVDs allow you to work at their pace or to do alternative moves until you can. They each have bonus sections and helpful tips to maximize your results.

1946921,5,B0000UQQTY,I love this video.  I rented this from the local library and enjoyed it so much that I purchased the set.  The video is good quality.  I mix the 3 videos from day to day.

They are easy to follow, and are paced for older people.  I really work up a sweat when I use them!

These are are not twenty-something's jumping around to heart-pumping aerobic music. These are mature women like us who are knowledgable about our bodies and how much we can and should be doing. The first morning I spent time with them doing the exercises I did not come away feeling beaten and sore - in fact, the next day I felt far more energy than I had in quite awhile.

When I am getting back in the groove I like to ease into it and I was looking for something that was real exercise but not quite the level of the Firm tapes that I usually follow.  I thought I would try this one.  It's okay however, the exercisers on the tape are completely asynchronis.  They just can't keep a beat.  They are not in time with the music, nor are they in time with each other.  I find that to do this DVD, I either have to turn away from the screen or else perform the moves with my eyes closed.

8003183,3,B0000UQQTY,"I recently picked up this 3-DVD set at a used book sale.  Although I am a experienced exercise who works out daily, I am conscious of the fact that I will be turning 50 in just six months, and so I have been adding workouts to my collection that will keep me active into the next decade.  Unfortunately, I do not think that this set is truly designed for those who are ALREADY active.  The cardio routine in particular is extremely simplistic, more for someone who is just starting out than for someone striving for the goal of ""keeping fit.""

This set consists of three DVDs, Aerobics (cardio), Strength, and Flexibility.  All of the routines are led by Robin Stuhr, an exercise physiologist, assisted by Cindy Joseph, a fitness model.  Each DVD is well-chaptered, which is one of the best things about this set.  Below I have listed chapter breakdowns as well as a short description of each DVD; I have added times as well.

Stuhr seems completely inexperienced as a fitness instructor here. She is off the beat, uses incorrect names for basic moves (such as grapevine), fails to explain new moves (including an entire Latin dance section with steps like cha-cha and mamba), and provides absolutely HORRENDOUS cueing. Joseph is clearly NOT a fitness video model--she is pleasant and smiling, but she also looks lost performing the moves, and she and Stuhr are frequently out of step. Finally, the video has some of the absolute WORST camera angles that I have ever seen in a fitness DVD. The camera often zoomed in extra close on Stuhr or Joseph, which made it even more difficult to follow the routine.

Stuhr seems ill-at-ease leading here as well, and she says ""terrific"" way too much. Joseph's role is rather odd, as she introduces some of the segments herself but then is relegated to making somewhat pithy comments throughout the workout.  The actual workout routine was not bad, definitely an improvement over the Aerobics DVD. It's nice that the DVD is so well-chaptered, although the breakdowns for the main workout (""Core Routine"") are confusing--i.e., it doesn't really make sense that Part 1 is almost 20 minutes long while the next section is <5 minutes. Most of the exercises are performed for 2 sets of 10 repetitions. Stuhr either uses no resistance (squats), dumbbells (rows, biceps curls, triceps kickbacks), or the band (leg extensions). The last section of the Core Routine (could have been labelled ""Part 4"") is a nice basic abs routine that includes some back work. Unlike the ""Aerobics"" DVD, this DVD does not include a cool-down or stretch. There is a segment on ""Advanced"" exercises that I would personally not consider advanced at all; rather, they add slightly more intense modifications to some of the exercises, such as a lunge with arms overhead.

The three ""Core Routine"" chapters, or the main stretching segments of this DVD, are actually quite nice. The exercises offered are probably best described as athletic stretching with a yoga feel. The first section starts on the floor to stretch the spine, and although Stuhr does not use yoga terms to describe the movements, she leads a series that includes exercises similar to the following postures in yoga: sphinx, cat/cow, child's pose, and revolved child's. The series is completed three times, and then this section ends with some hip and glutes stretches on the floor. The next section is focused on the lower body; it also is on the floor but consists mainly of hip and hamstring stretches. The final stretch segment uses a chair. This is effective for stretching the entire body, including additional hamstring stretch, calves, and ending with stretches seated in the chair, including neck stretches.  The last two segments, Introduction to Pilates and Introduction to Yoga, arguably should not be included at all, as Stuhr points out that neither she nor Joseph are instructors in either of these areas. Almost to prove this point, they are wearing shoes for the Pilates matwork, a clear no-no. Despite this, the 12-minute routine offered is pretty basic, easy-to-follow, and likely safe for most beginners. In contrast, the ""yoga"" routine was just awful; as a certified yoga instructor myself, I found it extremely difficult to watch (I certainly did not attempt to follow along!). It is strange in that the first part offers a series of still photos featuring Stuhr and Joseph performing various yoga poses in an outdoor setting; there is music but no voiceover, and the names of the poses appear on screen. The second part--no more than about 4 minutes--shows Stuhr and Joseph back in the studio performing those same postures. The instruction provided is VERY minimal, with some brief comments by Joseph, and both she and Stuhr display extremely bad form at times. It scares me to think of those new to yoga trying it for the first time based on this segment!!!

In the end, although I found some parts of this set to be worthwhile, I can't really recommend it overall.  There are just two many problems with it.  The Flexibility DVD might be worth purchasing individually if you are looking for a nice basic stretch...just stay away from those bonus segments.",1508630400,,6213,4.9433781190019195
