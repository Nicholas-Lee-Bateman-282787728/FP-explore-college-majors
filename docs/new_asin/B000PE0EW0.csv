8190651,3,B000PE0EW0,"I have been weight training regularly 3 times a week for six months and doing a lot of other sports for many years. I watched this DVD to improve my weight training techniques, learned somethings and enjoyed it. I recommend it to people who plan to advance in their weight training but with some warnings about the techniques explained in the DVD. I am not a doctor nor a sports expert. But I have been doing various sports for many years and read a lot about exercise, sports, weight training etc. written by doctors and sports people. I think  there is excessive exertion and wrong techniques in this DVD even for advanced weight trainers that could be harmful to health even though you may pump up your muscles. Strength training with weights is very useful if done properly, not the way it is demonstrated in this DVD. I am surprised that Dr. Nick Evans violates the issues I explain below, although he is a doctor in fact an orthopedist. He should know these things quite well.

1. Dr. Nick Evans sems to hold his breath temporarily while doing the weight training. On the contrary, many exercise books say breath should not be held : breathe in as you lower the weights and breath out while lifting them. Never stop breathing, not even for a few seconds.

2. He demonstrates several techniques to give a last push or pull beyond your limit to pump up the muscles even further. Many other reliable sources about strength training say otherwise ; excessive exertion can cause injury of muscles and joints, be discouraging and causing to quit. I recommend the biology of strength training section of the book called Younger Next Year. There you will also find the explanation that overexertion in strength training is particularly harmful for the joints. Because muscles develop faster than the joints and if there is too much pressure the joints could be pulled apart. You may observe development in the short run but could experience injury in the long run.

3. The DVD says that weight training should be done eg on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. Again from the book Younger Next Year and many similar sources about exrecise you can read that there must be a 48 hour rest between strength training sessions even if you change the group of muscles worked. You should not do it on consecutive days. Because muscles get worn down during strength training and during the next 48 hours a repair of the muscles and joints ensues. If you do not allow rest during that time and  continue to weight train instead on successive days, wearing down continues and no repair happens. Muscles maybe pumped up in the short run  but they do not develop healthily damaging the whole body in the long run. You can and should exercise everyday but change the type of exercise : doing weight training one day and another type of exercise eg : swimming, jogging, tennis etc. the following day.

4. Another thing emphasized in reliable exercise books including Younger Next Year is the necessity to use a heart rate monitor in all types of sports and exercises including weight training. I see that in the DVD weight training is done without a heart rate monitor. You may say you haven't seen anybody wearing a HRM for weight lifting but I think they should because without one your heart rate may elevate above your maximum allowed heart rate calculated by 220 - your age. Without a HRM you would not know it. Excessive beats per minute is dangerous and wears down your body with no health and longevity benefits alhough you may temporarily develop fancy muscles. Moreover any type of exercise is much more beneficial when you train within the heart rate zones of 65 % to 85 % of your maximum heart rate. Exercise is aerobic ( with oxygen ) and burns fat and sugar within that zone while it is unaerobic ( without oxygen ) burning no fat nor sugar and causing an accumulation of lactic acid in the muscles above that rate and should be done very carefully. If you are very fit you can train in the unaerobic zone but you need to know your BPM. Otherwise you could overexert yourself, get excessively tired with poor results risking your health, discouragement and quitting.

5. Like many other sports weight training must be followed by a set of around 15 stretching exercises to stretch the arm, leg, back, neck etc muscles that have become short during the training. Otherwise your muscles will stay short after the training risking cramps or more serious injuries. However, in the DVD at the end of the weight training Dr. Nick Evans does not mention let alone demonstrate the necessity of such a mandatory stretching session.

I think being an orthopedist Dr. Nick Evans should know and say better. So watch the DVD  to apply the techniques but be careful not to overexert yourself even if you are an advanced weight trainer. During the past six months I ran on the treadmill followed by weight training, followed by stretching  three times a week ( Monday, Wednesday, Friday ) gradually increasing  my weights, changed the exercises at a moderate and enjoyable pace without overexertion. On Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays I did no weight training, instead I swam, played tennis, stretched and walked. I became no Arnold Schwarzenegger but the injury free progress I showed in strength and muscular appearance is quite good.",1203379200,4,5321,4.746753246753247
