8153697,3,B000JZXLZ2,"This 1982 HBO variety special is all right for some good reasons. A top one is it serves as a reminder of how much long gone performers such as Stubby Kaye, Phyllis Diller and Edie Adams are missed by lovers of good entertainment. Miss Adams is especially good in fans and paired with statuesque Jeanne Linero in the duet ""Why is a Nice Girl Like Me Working in a Joint Like This?"" Edie also throws in her Mae West impression into the mayhem that constitutes the ""Crazy Train"" ensemble sketch that at one point becomes a Pullman car version of the joke wall from ""Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In."" Rip Taylor and Julie Newmar are hysterical in an insurance sketch all hinging on a case of misunderstanding that threatens to make the Ripper a nervous wreck. Dancing is sadlly limited to topless showgirls opening and closing the show plus a cutie chorus in the production number ""Nymphos of the Nile"" to which Taylor provides the male point of view. Solo artist Brandi Doran expertly bumps, grinds and peels her way to ""Night Train"" in an otherwise predictable premise of ballerina turned stripper. If you just want familiar faces thrust into the world of Minsky's these ""Follies"" are worth the time. If you expect more, look elsewhere.",1412985600,,1230,4.725581395348837
