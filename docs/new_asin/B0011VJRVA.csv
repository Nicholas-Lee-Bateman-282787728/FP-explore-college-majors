8242743,3,B0011VJRVA,"I counted 176 unduplicated cartoons in this collection, plus five duplicates. Although this is mostly quantity entertainment, there are a few highlights, such as the six Superman cartoons that lead off Disk 1. There's something from Tex Avery (Hamateur Night), Friz Freleng (The Fifth Column Mouse), and Chuck Jones (The Dover Boys). Print quality varies quite a bit; for example, Superman looks great but The Dover Boys is very washed out.
