2476095,3,B000E0LLFY,"Ultimate Fighting Championship is a U.S.-based mixed martial arts (MMA) organization, currently recognized as the major MMA promotion in North America.

UFC 53 - Heavy Hitters is a B-level event that delivers in some areas while miserably failing in others. As is often the case with the UFC, the card is chock full of of B-level fighters who do not deserve nor belong on a stage as large as the Ultimate Fighting Championship. The main event, pitting Rich Franklin and Nate Quarry is akin to a sad joke.  Nate Quarry earned a title shot just because he had a short stint on a reality television show.(He didn't even win)  The result is what you'd expect as Quarry is brutally exposed.  The other half of the double main-event is equally as laughable as Matt Hughes battles Joe Riggs in a mismatch of gigantic proportions.  The undercard bout between Gabriel Gonzaga and Kevin Jordan is one of the worst fights I have ever had the displeasure of watching.

With that said, there are a few interesting bouts. The Georges St. Pierre/Sean Sherk fight is very entertaining for the time it lasts.  GSP is a legitimate fighter and he proves it in this fight.  The Ansar Chalangov/Thiago Alves fight is also a pretty exciting tilt.

In the end, save your money. Unless you're a hardcore UFC fan, I don't think this event is worthy of your hard earned dollars. The UFC is not on the same level as PRIDE FC and UFC 56 really illustrates this point.",1152403200,,1439,4.633858267716535
2476096,5,B000E0LLFY,"This event opens with 2 veteran fighters making their UFC debuts. Nick Thompson and Keith Wisniewski. These are two decent fighters who put on a decent show, but neither of whom will do anything notable in the UFC, in my opinion.

Next, Thiago Alves fights Ansar Chalangov. After this short bout, we learn that there is now more than one ""Pitbull"" in the UFC. Alves looks very impressive in this fight.

Sam Hoger, of The Ultimate Fighter's first season, then takes on Jeff Newton. Hoger performs fairly well, yet I don't see in Hoger the ability to take on those at the top of the food chain. Decent fight, though, and some good skills are shown.

Jeremy Horn has a matchup with South African Trevor Prangley. Horn, fresh off of his loss to Chuck Liddell, is very evenly matched with Prangley. This is evident throughout a fight that ultimately goes to a razor-close decision. Prangley is the stronger of the two, while Horn is better versed in submissions. This is a good fight with good action.

The undercard fight that I most anticipated was between Georges St. Pierre and Sean Sherk. Both have lost to Matt Hughes and both are desperately trying to get a rematch with the champ...  The difference is, in my opinion, that if St. Pierre gets a rematch, he will probably win. This fight, however, is an awesome matchup, although it is difficult to find a good challenge for St. Pierre at this point. This one is stopped in the 2nd by some brutal ground & pound. Great fight.

Matt Hughes v. Joe Riggs. This is one half of what was supposed to be a double-championship title fight card. However, Joe ""Diesel"" Riggs was a little to diesel to make the required 170 lb weight limit. This caused the fight to be changed to a non-title bout, which obviously upset Hughes, who is quite proud of his streak of title defenses. Riggs looks terrible in this fight and it should be no ""spoiler"" to learn that Hughes makes extremely quick work of Riggs. Hughes looks impressive and Riggs looks like he needs to rethink some things. This fight was supposed to be between Hughes and Karo Parisyan and I believe that would have been a far better matchup. Hopefully, we get to see that fight in the near future, although I would LOVE to see a Hughes/St. Pierre rematch more than any other fight in the Welterweight division. St. Pierre gave Hughes all he could handle last time out and he has developed in leaps and bounds since then.

Rich ""Ace"" Franklin v. Nate ""Rock"" Quarry...  This is the highlight of the night for me. Franklin is at the top, determined to dominate the 185 lb. middleweight division, while Quarry is on the rise coming from The Ultimate Fighter season 1 and a string of 3 victories in his first 3 fights in the UFC. Franklin's display of skills is amazing and this leads to a very embarrasing round of fighting for Nate Quarry. You can say that Nate wasn't ready for Franklin, but Quarry had been fighting for a long time and I just don't think he is GOOD enough to challenge Franklin. I believe Franklin will dominate the middleweight division for quite a while.

The bonus features are extensive, giving you pre and post-fight footage, interviews, commentary, etc... Great footage, as always. This is an outstanding UFC event with some exciting moments and solid action. This was a good way to come back from the somewhat disappointing UFC 55 showing.

Highly recommended.",1150243200,8,3383,4.642140468227424
2476097,4,B000E0LLFY,This event was proof positive of why the champs are the champs. Both title fights are a showcase of why the champions deserve all the accolades that they can get. Both made it look REALLY easy. All in all this was a very good event to watch. Buy this DVD!!,1147910400,,256,4.14
2476098,3,B000E0LLFY,"UFC 56: Full Force is loaded with predictable matches, but is still entertaining by its own merits. The show is primarily a profit-motivated PPV riding on Nate Quarry's newfound fame as a contestant from The Ultimate Fighter reality show on Spike TV. Slated to battle for the Middleweight Championship against Rich ""Ace"" Franklin, UFC never fails to hype an otherwise mediocre match-up into one of legendary capacity.

To support the main event, UFC President Dana White tossed in what was supposed to be a war involving Matt Hughes defending his Welterweight Title against arguably the most effective Judo practitioner in mixed martial arts history, Karo ""The Heat"" Parysian. Unfortunately, Parysian suffered an ankle injury two weeks prior to the event and canceled. A drastically inferior opponent by the name of Joe ""Diesel"" Riggs stepped up to the challenge instead, which truly plummeted the integrity of UFC 56's complete fight card.

The fight card is as follows (rated on a scale of 0-10):

PRELIMINARY MATCHES
Nick Thompson vs Keith Wisniewski (7/10)
Thiago Alves vs Ansar Chalangov (7/10)
Sam Hoger vs Jeff Newton (6/10)

UFC's DVD features are still light years behind Pride's. Although the Behind-the-Scenes footages are a few minutes denser than its predecessors, the DVD has done away with pre-fight interviews, which adds color to a fight. With the exception of the main event Rich Franklin vs Nate Quarry, the matches simply follow one after the other in a passive and systemic fashion.",1146787200,3,1716,5.154676258992806
2476099,4,B000E0LLFY,"I liked the fact that the UFC had the two coaches from The Ultimate Fighter Season 2 fight on this card but the match ups leave something to be desired.

Nate Quarry is pretty good but not in the same league as Franklin. The fight featuring Matt Hughes is also over quickly.  A common complaint of UFC fans is the match ups on these pay per view cards.  The fighters people most want to see rarely fight each other.  More often, as in this case, the best fighters are matched against someone of lesser skill which is disappointing.

Some of the undercard fights on this DVD are very good though and the DVD cuts out most of the time filler from the pay per view version which is nice.",1144195200,3,684,4.271317829457364

This is the first MMA DVD I ever bought. I'm still proud to say it was, because it is a quite good card. It has a few of my all-time favorite fights (Thompson/Wisniewski, Horn/Prangley), as well as a flashback to when GSP was actually worth watching and when Matt Hughes was the baddest man on the planet. However, I say not perfect because of one single fight: the Gonzaga/Jordan tilt. That is singlehandedly the worst UFC fight I have ever watched, though not the worst MMA fight ever by a long shot; nothing will ever defeat Severn/Kimo at PRIDE 1 for that title. The first round is good, but at the end of that round, nothing happens until the end. The end is worth watching a few times, though. At the prices I've seen, it's quite worth it to pick this one up.",1281571200,,1064,4.484536082474227

FULL FORCE

Not one of the greatest event ever by the UFC but still a good event.

1. NICK THOMPSON VS KEITH WISNIEWSKI-the first round sees these two lock up a lot, there are a few exchanges but not too many. The second round has a lot of good ground game, and Nick really puts it on Keith. The third round is insane with reversal after reversal, good opening bout and Nick takes a decision victory. 4/5

2. THIAGO ALVES VS ANSAR CHALANGOV-this one ends pretty quick with Alves dominating Ansar on the ground and gets the KO after he mounts him. 5/5

3. SAM HOGER VS JEFF NEWTON-the first round is good and even has a nice arm bar attempt. The second round is looking just like the first until Sam locks in a rear naked choke and secures a victory. Another good fight on this card. 4.5/5

4. JEREMY HORN VS TREVOR PRANGLEY-amazing first round between these two gladiators right here, both just come at each other with all they got. There are a lot of times that this fight could have been stopped, but each refused to give in. the second round is just as exciting with a lot of hard hitting action. The third round was another back and forth battle, and after a hard fought fight Jeremy Horn takes this one. 5/5

5. GEORGES ST. PIERRE VS SEAN SHERK-the first round of this fight was all GSP which should surprise nobody, he completely gave it to Sherk in this one. The second starts off ok but GSP just lays into him much like the first and ends this fight in the second after he pummels Sherk on the ground. 5/5

6. MATT HUGHES VS JOE RIGGS-this was for Hughes title but Riggs didn't make weight and had to give up the title shot. This fight ends fairly quickly as Hughes locks in a kimora in the first round and forces Riggs to tap out. I guess it wouldn't have mattered if the title was on the line. 5/5

7. GABRIEL GONZAGA VS KEVIN JORDAN-the first round was pretty good not to much action but it was still good, a good take down at the beginning. Round two was pretty uneventful up until the end of it, and the fight looked pretty even at this point. The third round looked like the second until with less then a minute left Gonzaga knocks out Jordan with a superman punch. 3/5

8.[MIDDLEWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP] RICH FRANKLIN VS NATE QUARRY-all I can say about this one is wow, Rich keeps his belt after he knocks out Nate with a great straight left. This has got to be one of the best knock outs I have ever seen in MMA, you should definitely see this event for this one right here. 5/5

This was a good event that I recommend every one see, that main event was amazing.",1221782400,,2581,4.259713701431493
8103168,4,B000E0LLFY,"Entertaing UFC DVD with Hughes, St Pierre/Sherk, and Franklin.  My biggest Complaint on this DVD is the UFC cutting out the Ken/Tito Confrontation which was the prelude to their TUF competition? Why?",1193097600,,199,5.21875

8103171,4,B000E0LLFY,"Fresh off season two of the Ultimate Fighter, coaches Rich Franklin and Matt Hughes were showcased in UFC 56 - Full Force against less than ""championship level"" fighters. Still though, both champions were ready as well as their opponents. The rest of the card comprised of several familiar and new faces.

Ansar Chalangov was a fighter of noteworthy mentioning in MMA. His success in smaller shows had propelled him to the big leagues against a young standout of the heralded American Top Team. Thiago Alves' UFC debut was a disappointing loss to Spencer Fisher in a bout he was favored to win. His match up with Chalangov would be an interesting one for both fighters. After some good action, the bout took a sharp turn to the victor via TKO.

With the success of the Ultimate Fighter TV series, many of the former contestants/fighters made for good fillers of fight cards. Sam Hoger the heel of the house of season one was back after a set back against season one finalist Stephan Bonnar. Hoger's well-rounded skills were put to the test against an older fighter, but newcomer with a karate base. Jeff Newton had racked up a good  4-1 record against lighter opposition in smaller shows. Right off the bat, Newton's fight stance was very unconventional as he positioned himself in a Karate/Tae Kwon Do side-stance. The battle would be a see-saw battle that would go into two rounds.

After several years of compiling one of the busiest MMA careers, Jeremy Horn signed a 3-fight deal with the UFC...with the first fight against Light Heavyweight champion Chuck Liddell. Unfortunately for Horn, his long awaited rematch with Liddell resulted in a disappointing loss. His second fight would be in the middleweight (185lb) division against a strong fighter from South Africa. Trevor Prangley was a big middleweight, his strength and explosive style drove many former opponents into fits. His most recent victory against BJJ black belt Travis Lutter took many by surprise. A very close fight that would go the distance would leave many unhappy, but technically a very good match.

This card was a double main event featuring two champions, but the following fight in itself was arguably the most competitive on paper and could have been a main even it itself. Sean Sherk was MMA's unfortunate son. His incredible record of 29-1-1 was the result of a swarming wrestling style. His only blemish came in the hands of champion Matt Hughes in UFC 42, and even that match went the distance. Since his loss, he found it hard find a place in the bigger shows (Pride, UFC, and K-1) to exhibit his skills. He was financially strapped and briefly retired from the sport. His call though was answered by the UFC, but his opponent though young, certainly wasn't a novice. Georges St. Pierre's MMA career sky-rocketed immediately after his debut in the UFC. In his debut he bested Judo standout Karo Parisyan. After a spectacular knockout of Jay Hieron, he found himself in a championship match-up against Matt Hughes. While St. Pierre certainly had the physical and skillful attributes to someday become a champion, many questioned whether he really deserved a crack at the title. The bout against Hughes went his way until Hughes turned things around. Many of his critics took pleasure in his defeat (lone defeat in MMA) via an arm-bar submission, but his stock actually did rise considering he really gave Hughes a battle. From this lesson, he tore through an impressive list of good fighters: Dave Strasser, Jason Miller, and most impressively in dominating fashion his victory over Frank Trigg. The stage was set for two fighters at the top of the food chain in regards to contention of Matt Hughes' title. The fight was impressive from a technical and action standpoint, but a clear winner would have his hand raised.

The aforementioned Matt Hughes was ready to defend his title against Karo Parisyan. Unfortunately for many fight fans, Parisyan injured himself in training and had to pull out. With little time to work with, the UFC decided on Joe ""Diesel"" Riggs. Another disappointment though occurred at the weigh-ins as Riggs failed to make weight and the bout was decided to go on but as a non-title match instead. This soured the co-main event, but the bout did have interesting substance. Matt Hughes could not afford to lose, even if it was a non-title match. Riggs while not fighting for the title still posed a threat to Hughes given his size and strength that on paper rivaled Hughes. The battle between two goliaths of the lightweight (170lb.) division would end in one round after a rather surprising submission.

The always crucial bout before the main event has always carried importance to provide excitement and buzz to carry over to the main event. In selecting Gabriel Gonzalez versus Kevin Jordan, the UFC brass believed in something many did not see...or later would have to unfortunately experience.  In short, this bout did end in a dramatic KO, but a lesson in dancing was not billed!

Since a convincing victory over Ken Shamrock in the Ultimate Fighter Finale, Rich Franklin's fan base really took an upwards directional swing. He followed this up with beating Evan Tanner into a doctor stoppage to earn the middleweight championship. His fortunes took off when he was selected (along with Matt Hughes) as a coach for the popular Ultimate Fighter II. TV show. His opponent thought left many with doubts of a competitive fight. Nate Quarry is no novice, he was labeled this by many because of his participation in season one of the Ultimate Fighter. In that original season, Quarry suffered a freakish injury and was not able to continue. At 35 years, he was the elder of the two and had strong right hand that helped him earn the nickname ""the Rock"". His 8-1 record was impressive, but his victories were not against contender level fighters. After a good feel out period, a noticeable broken nose followed by a paralyzing straight would send the defeated down for the count. A clear and convincing victory to end things for the night.",1157760000,,6050,4.877431906614786
