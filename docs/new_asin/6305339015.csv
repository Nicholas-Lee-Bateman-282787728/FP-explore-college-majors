1012732,5,6305339015,"""Striking Poses"" has to be one of my very favorite Shannen Doherty movies because it's highly dramatic, fast moving and not one of those typical women's ludicrous bio-TV movies. I just saw this movie the other day on LMN and surprisingly I never heard of it before recently. But I knew it would be great because anything with Shannen always is! ""Striking Poses"" is also different because it's not exactly a TV movie. It's one of those straight-to-video films that Shannen tended to make during the late 90's. You can tell because Gage (Shannen) used the ""f"" word at least once during it.

Anyway this is a story of a photographer, Gage who starts getting stalked. It actually was pretty frightening and fierce in some scenes because Shannen was able to capture the essence of her character's turmoil. It was written all over her face. After being scared the night before by a burglar (or a potential stalker?,) the movie starts out with Gage sneaking inside a health club to take some pictures of a celebrity. Personally, I did not like the scene with the ""actress"" and the drugs because looking at someone doing drugs is in my book just as offensive as hardcore porn or violence. Once Gage got her pictures she runs out, only to find that she's being followed! While on the phone (who knew they had handless cell phones in the 90's!) with her assistant Casey (Tamara Gorski) she is instructed to take the back exit (her assistant apparently had some inside view of the club) and got away from him with only seconds to spare!

Pretty soon Gage hires a security guy to take care of her, Joseph Griffin played Nick Angel. And he sets up an elaborate-looking security system and tried to help put Gage's fears at ease. The rest of the movie is pretty fast moving and somewhat unpredictable. The ending scene in the studio was so over the top because it was just so extreme. When Gage set the place on fire and her stalker was engulfed in flames I couldn't help but think that this was something Bren would have loved to do to Kelly Taylor for stealing Dylan. The question is who's the mouse and who's the cat...?",1209859200,4,2109,4.576719576719577
1012733,3,6305339015,"yep the only reason i bothered to watch this movie was the fact that shannen is in, i love mostly everything she is in, i also agree with what another person said, charmed completely SUCKED after shannen left! i don't watch 90210 so i cant comment there. Anyway onto this movie, Shannen plays Gage Sullivan a papparazi who is being stalked by a dangerous killer. She calls on the help of a bodyguard and from here on things get complicated. This is a pretty good movie, many twists and turns and it is almost impossible to predict the ending. Shannen gives a GREAT performance as per usual. Definetly above average.",1099440000,3,615,4.6
1012734,4,6305339015,This is an auesome movie.  She plays a photographer.  So when someone starts following her and taking her picture things get deadly.  Anyone who likes a good drama is in for a treat.,1049673600,,182,4.454545454545454
1012735,5,6305339015,"Yes, I'm an unabashedly, unapologetic die-hard fan of Shannen Doherty.  She's gorgeous, and she can ACT.  Let's get real, okay?  90210 sucked after she left, and Charmed has followed suit.  This movie (which I got a Best Buy for $5.99 on DVD) is a starring vehicle for Shannen.  She plays a tabloid journalist on whom the tables get turned, as she becomes the victim of a stalking psycho.  Throw in a sexy, but dangerous, bodyguard; a kooky best friend, and some bumbling FBI agents, and you have a packed thriller that's not too violent, vrey unpredictable and FULL OF SHANNEN!  BUY BUY BUY!",1025654400,20,592,4.689320388349515
1012736,5,6305339015,"A great film with great plot twists. Gage (Shannen) is a top paparazzi with two problems - 1) She has a stalker, 2) She becomes involved in a murder. You with me so far? From this point on the film rides like a roller coaster: Con artists, black mail and murder land Gage in a quest to win back her life. The storyline alone makes up for the questionable acting (Shannen Doherty excluded) - .
I have yet to decide if the actors are playing bad acting charactors, or if they are just bad actors, even so, viewers will be to busy drooling at Shannen to notice anyone else.",1014508800,6,570,4.238532110091743

7888140,4,6305339015,"Stirking Poses isn't bad for a TV movie, and certainly has more twists and tries a bit harder to be a bit more complicated storyline wise than your TV movie norm.  Like most TV movies, you've probably (other than in other TV movies) never seen any of the cast before, with the exception of an actor fro a former popular TV show (in this case Shannen Doherty from 90210).  Doherty actually does a good job in this one and if you're a fan of hers due to her looks, she looks pretty good in this one.  She plays a paparazzi photographer who has had the tables turned on her and is being photographed, her house broken into and is being stalked while on the job by a guy who taunts her by leaving behind chewing gum.  There's actually a lot more to this story than that, but giving away anything else would spoil those surprises for you.",1477526400,,833,4.286624203821656

7888145,5,6305339015,"Different to all other movies that it puts you on guard. Something isn't quite right and yet seems right, the curves thrown in this show that it take you by surprise. Cast and storyline are fantastic so convincing that you would not image it. Wait for the door slams with the ideas the writer has created. She a paparazzo with a magazine and is been stalked by a ruthless killer with nerve shattering games of life or death. Edge of the seat thrills nail biting moments that will make you feel involved to the limit. So I rated this an A grade plus for the suspense and feelings included in the movie. Marvelous entertainment waiting to be viewed so what are you waiting for, collect the movie gather up the popcorn and relax to a brilliant night in with a fabulous thriller. I should say try to relax.  Enjoy!",1389571200,,810,4.436241610738255
