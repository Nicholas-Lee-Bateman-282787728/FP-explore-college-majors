8583275,5,B00204TKFU,"I lost my cat ""Cashmere"" three weeks ago, she had FIV but managed to be happy and healthy for 5 years in my home.  I found her as a stray on vacation in West Virginia and knew she should come home with me.  Since then she has been my little baby.

My friend gave me this DVD and I'm buying one for another friend today.  It comes with two DVDs and both are good.  The ""grieving process"" dvd help me the most but I think I will need to watch it a few more times.  Both disks have good storytelling and the reverend is a very good speaker.  I feel better after watching it so I recommend it.
