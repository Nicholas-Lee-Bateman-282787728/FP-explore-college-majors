5663314,5,B00BPA2H3M,"Garbage has been one of my favorite bands of all time, even as I am more inclined to 70s and 80s music.

I have always bought each of their albums, starting with Version 2.0, upon their release date and have never been disappointed.  In fact I consider their latest CD, Not Your Kind of People (Deluxe Edition), their strongest ever.

In preparation for the release of their BD I made a CD with my favorite Garbage tracks for the road and was surprised that I made a selection of 40+ songs.  This is proof of the excellent quality of all their CDs, bearing in mind that Garbage has only released 5 albums in their glorious career.

For several years I have been a fan of live DVDs and now Blu-rays and have always been puzzled why favorite acts of mine, like Garbage, Boston,  John Mellencamp, Soundgarden, Prince, Train, Gin Blossoms, Lenny Kravitz and Toad The Wet Sprocket have never put a live career retrospective on Blu-ray video.

Fortunately, that wait is over at least for Garbage as they have released One Mile High...Live on May 28th.  The song selection is very good as it covers all their hits and albums, although several of my favorite songs from the excellent Bleed Like Me, were left out.

The video is sharp and the sonic assault is nothing short of expectacular, exactly what I was expecting from Garbage and Eagle Rock.

Although I am not a big fan of bands rearranging their songs, Garbage did add some minor embellishments/tempo changes to some of the songs that worked perfectly.  Their is even a treat for Blade Runner fans at the start of Hammering In My Head.

Let's hope those other acts finally release BDs before I get too old.",1369008000,6,1656,4.576271186440678

5663318,5,B00BPA2H3M,"Garbage's ""One Mile High....Live"" DVD is SO fantastic, overdue (from band!) and welcome!!!!  Garbage is one of the top supergroup's from the 90's that really defied categorization, and, for some unknown reason, not only didn't release an abundance of live performances on DVD, but virtually, none!  Well, even though ""One Mile High...Live"" was recorded after a 7-year break, during the tour to promote Garbage's new (at the time) ""Not Your Kind Of People"" lp/cd, Shirley Manson (lead singer & frontperson extradinarire!!!), Butch Vig, Steve Marker & Duke Erikson don't miss a beat!!!  In fact, it's extremely difficult to believe that it could be so long....their performance is top-notch, high energy & all members deliver 100%+++!!!  They look and sound great (as though ""time stood still"")  Absolutely worth the wait; Shirley Manson & Garbage delight their fans, while looking like they're having a delightful time themselves...which is a breath of fresh air!!!",1456272000,4,964,5.357615894039735

5663320,4,B00BPA2H3M,Great DVD.  Sound wasn't that good at first than it got better after a couple songs.  They did some new stuff in it which some was great and some was alright.,1454284800,,158,4.064516129032258

5663324,2,B00BPA2H3M,Garbage. Like the name of the band this dvd is pretty much garbage. Thought I would give them and knew a few  of their songs but not what I expected,1433894400,,148,3.933333333333333
5663325,3,B00BPA2H3M,I love garbage and one day I will marry Shirley. But this bluray didn't do it for me. One of my least favorite concert blurays I own due to the quality of sound and camera work.,1433289600,,177,3.9444444444444446
5663326,3,B00BPA2H3M,"I love Garbage and have many, many of their songs/albums. When they went on tour I was a bit miffed I could not work my schedule into seeing them as they appeared fifty miles from where I live. I was surprised and pleased that they put one of their best tours on DVD. I bought it and put it into my player hoping to see greatness from Shirley and the lads. It was just okay. It was their concert in Colorado, and do not get me wrong I love to see and listen to it but it just did not have the excitement I thought I would get from seeing the band play. I guess next time they go on tour I will have to see them in person.",1425168000,,621,3.8217054263565893

5663329,5,B00BPA2H3M,"Ok, I've been telling my wife since their first record that Shirley Manson is the best female rock singer ever. Of course she completely ignored me and always said ""what about (fill in name)?"" Finally a few weeks ago I got her to watch ""Mile High"" with me. About half way through the show she said ""Wow, her voice is incredible. Have you noticed?"" I said ""Huh? Oh, well, I just like the music. I'll listen closer.""
Really, this show is terrific! I saw basically this same concert in Chicago and then again in Milwaukee (on the same tour). Songs that I thought were way too cutesy for me kind of blow you out of the building, or room in the case of the DVD. I'd give this video, Shirley Manson, and Garbage ten stars if I could.",1410220800,3,727,4.27536231884058
5663330,5,B00BPA2H3M,A must have for any garbage fan.,1410048000,,32,3.7142857142857144
5663331,5,B00BPA2H3M,"Garbarge is one of my favorite bands of all time!  I think Shirley Manson exudes sexuality & power.  She is an amazing performer.  Gabage has some really great rock songs from the last twenty years.  Their music is very powerful.  This is a great performance.  The sound production is good.  I think the camera work & lighting are poor.  Several shots of the camera on the band from a distance but then an audience member puts their smart phone right in the way.  The lighting on stage was terrible.  There were no spot lights to make the band members, most notably Shirley, the center of attention.  Those were my only complaints.  Other than that this was a string Garbage performance.",1408924800,,687,4.633333333333334
5663332,5,B00BPA2H3M,"They are still in great form after all these years. Perhaps better, actually. And the quality of the production is excellent. If you are a Garbage fan, you must have it. I don't like many live performance films, because the musical quality often isn't so good. But this one is outstanding.",1408320000,3,289,4.686274509803922
5663333,4,B00BPA2H3M,"Glad that they made a live show available finally.
Too bad its not from when they were in their prime.

And since this is a self-published, it is raw.

You have audience raising their arms into the shot, and you're staring at their smartphones recording the stage.

At least nobody brought a ipad, or there would be no concert to see!

I have 5.1 speakers but cannot hear any benefit from this DTS sound mastering as marked on the package. How real is those labels?",1405900800,,465,4.435294117647059

5663335,3,B00BPA2H3M,"the band garbage choose the wrong place to record their blue ray disc one mile high---live.  the performances in montery, mexico
were so much better the mtv performances in front of 9000 fans.  the band had so much more life performing back in 2012 then on this blue ray disc.  i would of so much more enjoyed their performances on a blue ray disc if it would of been them in montery, mexico.  the band has talent but on this blue ray disc performing in a indoor setting made them look lifeless and very uninteresting.",1397001600,,518,4.421052631578948
5663336,3,B00BPA2H3M,"I loved Shirley Manson at first sight on the ""I'm Only Happy When It Rains"" video years ago. From that day forward I bought anything the band had at the time and everything since. This DVD was just okay in my opinion. The sound and film quality wasn't what I'd expect, but Garbage is a VERY talented group and Shirley is absolutely BEAUTIFUL in fact she seems to get better looking with age and her voice as well. Over all maybe I expected to much, so I felt a bit of a let down.",1395705600,,479,4.1063829787234045
5663337,5,B00BPA2H3M,"great quality, I enjoy it often.  I would be there next time. go see them if you get the chance.",1392422400,,96,3.8
5663338,4,B00BPA2H3M,"Finally a live documentation of Garbage has been officially released! I was wondering when they were going to release a compilation of their videos for years and that eventually happened with the best of release done some years ago. Now we get to see them in action on stage after numerous years of touring extensively throughout the world!

Let's get something straight first. Shirley Manson has great stage presence and is a good singer. Despite her forgetting lyrics on some of the songs and losing her place halfway through, the woman can still deliver a solid performance.

Now I understand, if anything, Garbage are no longer as prominent as they once were like back in 1998 and have had to release their latest album entitled Not Your Kind of People basically on their own. You could see they're on a tight budget on this video release. Sure it's only rock'n roll and it should be more about the performance if anything. But I feel for an official video release, better preparation could have been established. A good lighting system and making sure mistakes were avoided could have made this video release a bit more tight. Having said that, I appreciated the cinematic images that were shown like they performed Queer.

I would say this is definitely more for committed Garbage fans and anyone else might feel a little let down. Perhaps it's best to just keep it for the fans at this point in their career.

I am sorry to see certain songs not included on the set list for this particular performance such as Metal heart, Bad Boyfriend, Sex is not the enemy and the world is not enough. But still you do get a pretty extensive selection of other songs with this video release.",1392336000,,1685,4.6824324324324325
5663339,5,B00BPA2H3M,"Great show, a must for Garbage fans. Only dislike is it could be  longer.
The band is very tight and precise.",1391299200,,109,4.190476190476191
5663340,5,B00BPA2H3M,"Unlike most bands, I have found Garbage to be a much better stage band than studio band.  Shirley Manson's one-of-a-kind voice just sounds better, and seems to be the audio focal point.",1389830400,,185,4.78125
5663341,5,B00BPA2H3M,"Garbage is great.  Shirley is great.  Blu Rays are great.  High Def is great.  What more do you need to know?  The band, as always, does a great rendition of all the songs listed.  If you love Garbage, this is a no-brainer.  If you like good music with a rock and pop style, then you will likely love this too.",1386720000,8,310,4.066666666666666
5663342,5,B00BPA2H3M,"Great Sound, wonderful Blu-ray picture, what more could a Garbage fan want?  Hope there are more of these in the future.",1382745600,,120,4.714285714285714
5663343,5,B00BPA2H3M,"After a long hiatus they regrouped and thats great. The show and the music is all swagger. They lack showmanship. they would be more of a show if they took the time to have someone help them make a showing of their musicianship and attitude. They have power and the chops to put on a great show, they lack refinement in their presentation. If you like Garbage they deliver the goods in this video.",1382659200,,397,4.378378378378378
5663344,5,B00BPA2H3M,"I'm 58 and loved this show.  Audio and video quality were very good, which is important to me.  It was interesting in noting the crowd shots that MOST of the concert-goers here are a little older than the usual teeny bob concerts.  The median age of this crowd was probably around 40ish.  The price was good too, so this is a win-win.",1382572800,8,334,4.338709677419355

5663347,5,B00BPA2H3M,"Excellent DVD.  Good quality, sound is terrific.  I was at this concert, and this DVD does a great job of capturing the experience.  Highly recommended!",1379030400,,152,5.0
5663348,5,B00BPA2H3M,"As a long time fan of Garbage, but never having been able to see them live, this is definitely the next best thing. I love the way it's filmed, and it makes you feel like you were there, the way it captures the energy of the band. Every song sounds flawless and full of energy, you can't help but want to sing along and/or dance along with Shirley. The concert includes several of their songs from the new album but also a lot of hits from their older albums. Overall, a great choice in songs and a great performance.",1378598400,,517,4.232323232323233
5663349,4,B00BPA2H3M,"I'm hardcore fan, Shirley is a goddess, I've lover her for a long time... although I'd prefer one of the old shows in BD quality (maybe some Version 2.0 concert) her beauty, attitude, voice is mesmerizing",1378598400,,204,4.694444444444445
5663350,5,B00BPA2H3M,This Garbage concert is pure bliss. The camera work focused on the concert and didn't rely on any gimmicks through out the entire performance. The band sounds better than ever and chose a wide range of material from their entire catalog. If you've seen the NY Garbage concert on Youtube this Denver concert will put that one to shame on every account.,1377302400,,351,4.67741935483871
5663351,5,B00BPA2H3M,"Shirley and her crew do an incredible job of rocking the hell out of this concert!  Whether your a fan of Garbage or just alternative music, you won't regret buying this concert!",1376611200,,178,4.5625
5663352,5,B00BPA2H3M,great blu-ray to watch if you like this group and lik them in concert and the way they sound and look,1376438400,,101,3.857142857142857
5663353,4,B00BPA2H3M,This is a great blu ray capturing garbage in true form. Very tight sound and a very simple stage setting with minimal effects. Magnificent in dts with good surround.,1376006400,,165,4.724137931034483
5663354,4,B00BPA2H3M,"If you're a fan, you've already bought this. If you've never heard/heard of Garbage, you need to remedy this posthaste--I'd say start with the debut album and if that floats yer boat, buy all the rest of the disks! While this DVD has ""The Hits Played Faster"", I wouldn't necessarily start here as performance-wise these fine gentleman and lady aren't causing KISS any sleepless nights (i mean theatrically, Garbage's tunes are exponentially better). Some of the older songs are re-arranged/re-constructed which is only meaningful if you know how the original versions went. Mz. Manson is in very good voice and the band manages to walk the tightrope between playing the songs note-for-note and breathing some fire into it--no mean feat given all the sequencing and triggered samples going on and tour bassist Eric A (ex-Janes Addiction) manages to rock out while standing 3 feet from the drum kit. The mix is clear and pristine--not too surprising given the 3 Record Producers in the band--and Butch Vig is a great friggen' drummer, who knew?",1376006400,,1042,5.028901734104046
5663355,5,B00BPA2H3M,"This concert video was produced with a more ""like you are there"" approach.  No overproduced, video filters, distracting zooms, or quick edits.  It is a high quality production that allows you to enjoy the performance of the band instead of endure a video director's gimmicks.  I have seen too many concert videos with behind the scene montages, two second edits, and other nonsense right in the middle of the show.  Who wants that?  This production on the other hand lets you feel what it would be like to actually be at the show.  The sound was approached the same way.  It is very close to, if not directly from, a sound board recording.  I was not aware of any post production tweaking that usually turns a concert into a studio sounding recording.  Finally a band that is confident enough to allow a concert video to actually be about the concert.",1375660800,10,851,4.62
5663356,5,B00BPA2H3M,Everything you want from Garbage.  Songs from the new album mixed with their classics.  Sounds and looks incredible.  Produced and mixed very well.  Shirley and the guys in top form!,1375574400,,182,4.966666666666667
5663357,5,B00BPA2H3M,"Long story short... If you like Garbage, this concert is well-filmed, and superbly played. Shirley and the boys sound awesome and their setlist is impeccably well-selected. Sound quality rocks in both stereo and 5.1 surround modes and the picture quality is typical HD video. Thankfully, this film isn't over-produced and allows your to experience the show as if you were there and not as a flashy music video. The extras are fun, and the two music videos included are worthy add-ons. If interested, just buy it. You won't be disappointed.",1375056000,,539,5.0

5663364,3,B00BPA2H3M,"This Blu- Ray is a very average, low budget visual affair.  It sounds great and the band delivers but video production is meeting a very low standard.

Shirley Manson, and Butch Vig shine live and this is evident in this live show. This is not your high budget concert footage, but rather a more relaxed coverage.
I guess it's more like really being at the concert and taking your own footage. I would have liked more songs but to finally have a live concert, and in Blu-ray, is a real treat.",1372291200,,473,4.576470588235294

5663370,4,B00BPA2H3M,"The last time Garbage were on a world tour in 2005 they ended up cancelling the end of their tour citing burn out as one of the reasons, the truth was of course was that tensions were a an all-time high in the band and the chances of them setting off on a world tour again were slim. Fast forward 7 years to 2012 and the band released comeback album ""Not Your Kind Of People"" and the band once again set off on a world tour which is now documented on the Blu-Ray release ""One Mile High...Live"".

Recorded in Denver in October of 2012 the band play tracks off all 5 studio albums which if you are familiar with you know sticks to their pop-rock fusion that has served them so well since 1995. The set begins with the trippy dance sounding ""Automatic Systematic Habit"" which is full of big poppy beats backed by guitars and loads of vocal effects. The bands mixes in the old tracks with the new and play to a packed crowd in a cramped arena. They don't rely on any fancy video screens instead the members take center stage with fiery lead singer Shirley Manson draped in all black. Some of the older songs get slight make overs most notably ""Stupid Girl"" and ""Only Happy When It Rains"". In all the band play a 20 song set with fourth album ""Bleed Like Me"" only being represented by the superb ""Why Do You Love Me"".

Off the new songs from ""Not Your Kind Of People"" the ones that stand out most are the heavy ""Battle In Me"" and ""Control"" with its great slow build up and great use of harmonica. The band are again joined by ex-Jane's Addiction bassist Eric Avery. They finish with their very first single ""Vow"" with its chopped up guitar sound still sounding as fresh as ever. The picture is crystal clear and sound is great, especially in 5.1.

This is Garbage's first official live release and is long overdue and shows Garbage still have a life left in them, also included is a look at how five of the tracks from ""Not Your Kind Of People"" came to life including ""Automatic Systematic Habit"", ""Control"", ""Big Bright World"", ""Blood For Poppies"" and ""Battle In Me"". The two black and white music videos for ""Blood For Poppies"" and ""Big Bright World"" are also included.",1370736000,13,2166,4.396508728179551
5663371,5,B00BPA2H3M,So nice to see these rock icons on a well made blue ray.  DTS HD Encoding  A nice mix of songs off the new album and the classics of their past.  Great show.  If you are fan this is a dream come true.  Excellent!,1369958400,6,212,3.727272727272727
5663372,4,B00BPA2H3M,"Having seen Garbage seven times dating back to 1995, I can honestly say I've seen an amazing transformation. The first time I saw them, it was like they weren't sure if they belonged on stage, and Shirley Manson seemed to have no confidence at all. I'm glad I stuck with them, because this, kids, is how you perform rock music.

In the first few seconds, the video nerd in me was shocked to see pretty much straight 1080/60i HD video, but it wasn't long before I guessed that maybe that was the point. This is not a video full of fast cuts and tired effects. In fact, I'd be shocked if there was a cut shorter than five seconds. It was shot in what I call ""PBS style,"" in that the entire focus is on the performance, not some clever editing nonsense or goofy color grading. It was the right choice.

Garbage is one of the tightest live bands you'll ever see, but without being entirely perfect. You'll hear a few pitch problems or hear the players get out of sync, but the sheer power and volume of the performance makes it easy to overlook. Instead you're impressed with the noises that come out of the guitars (""Hammering In My Head""), and arrangements that often improve some classic songs (""Only Happy When It Rains""). You're completely drawn in to the sorrow of ""Milk,"" and punched in the goodies with the noise and fury of ""Vow.""

The set list evolved quite a bit on this tour, and as much as I love the band, I will admit that this wasn't their strongest. I understand they mix it up (I'd get bored playing the same thing every night). I thought performances of ""I Hate Love,"" ""Man On A Wire,"" ""The World Is Not Enough,"" ""You Look So Fine"" and in particular, ""Beloved Freak"" were real treats, but they're not here. Think of it as incentive to see them in real life.

A companion CD or MP3's would be a great addition.",1369958400,25,1824,4.371681415929204
5663373,4,B00BPA2H3M,"There is no video on Earth that can prepare you for the mind bending moment you're caught in the laser like gaze of Garbage front-woman Shirley Manson.  I'm lucky enough to have wandered into that enviable position twice; the first chance encounter found in a backstage corridor at Chicago's United Center in 2001 whilst coming out of the men's toilet after a TV interview with drummer Butch Vig and guitarist Duke Erikson (for the record the interview did not take place in the gents room).  With one sly smirk Shirley quite literally turned the space around me into an airless vacuum and my mind to a quivering gel-like goo.  The second brush coming last April during a show on the bands home turf in Madison, Wisconsin.  There I was, somehow lured to the Orpheum Theatre's front row by an invisible and ominous force.  And then suddenly there she was AGAIN, but this time perched on a stage monitor like a bean-sdhe; her eyes locked into mine, she the hungry creature ready to feast on me, the lost boy trapped in an unholy, cavernous space.  If you have walked in my shoes you know when Shirley sets her sights on you, it's not with a quick glance, she quite literally drags you into her world, and every word she sings (seemingly written just for you) sizzles like a blowtorch on your heart and scrambled gray matter.  And then as you feel your knees buckling under the weight of her siren song she releases you from her hypnotic trance and moves on to cast her glorious spell on another hapless (yet all too willing) victim.

If you were to purchase One Mile High... Live simply for the tingly thrill of witnessing one of the world's most glorious creature's (not to mention transcendent front-women) circling the stage like a beautiful and rare caged cat and roaring like the same aforementioned animal to spectacular effect it would be well worth the meager sticker price.  However, there is so much more to devour here, not the least of which is the razor-to-wrist performances of some of the greatest music ever unleashed; Stupid Girl, I Think I'm Paranoid, Only Happy When it Rains, Push It and Battle In Me among many other classic, should-be classic and soon to be classic gems.

There is no question that our beloved Scottish goddess is an undeniable human and musical force to be reckoned with but her partners in this brilliantly executed crime are hardly slouches in their own rights.  I won't bore you with drummer Butch's resume as Wikipedia can fill you in nicely on his knob turning turns with Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins and Foo Fighters, what Butch contributes here is the intensity and clock-like accuracy of a machine spawned from a jack-hammer and Swiss-watch as dueling guitarists/keyboardists Duke and Steve Marker cut through the relentlessly satisfying set-list with the precision of diamond cutters.  And lest we forget, touring bass player Eric Avery (Jane's Addiction/NIN), welded next to the drum kit, shovels low-end coal onto the mix like a fireman on a runaway locomotive.

If there is only one disappointment to be found here it's that the serviceable film production wasn't well... more spectacular.  Now that's not to say Garbage doesn't look great in 1080i and their stage is after-all a fairly no-frills affair but Garbage is certainly deserving of a much slicker sheen,  the kind of visual treatment and quality the likes of  Depeche Mode and U2 demand with every live film they release, a.k.a. the Anton Corbijn treatment.  But I suppose that is a minor rub considering the bang-for-your-buck found in this historic and satisfying visual document.  In the end Garbage transcends any shortcomings One Mile High... Live may present through a performance that will leave blisters on your eardrums and enough eye-candy to keep you hopped-up on endorphin's like a lovelorn school boy until the next time they come around.",1369958400,4,3859,4.874617737003058
