7802629,4,5559832359,"Ivan Parker, a favorite of mine, started this classic selection with a fast moving arrangement of ""Further Along"" from the Ryman Gospel Reunion Concert. This was followed by Squire Parson and the Homecoming Friends singing ""Beulah Land"" from the same historic program. I also enjoyed ""My Tribute"" featuring Russ Taft and ""Joy Comes in the Morning"" as sung by Joy Gardner.

The Gaither Vocal Band sang ""The King is Coming,"" ""I Believe in a Hill Called Mount Calvary,"" ""The Old Rugged Cross Made the Difference,"" and ""Oh, What a Time.""  A marvelous blending of talent, harmony, enthusiasm, inspiration, and worship.

Larry Ford sang from his heart in unique arrangements of ""Whispering Hope"" and ""What a Friend We Have in Jesus."" I especially enjoyed the numbers featuring Evie Karlsson. Jake Hess and Lynda Randall.

I now have the three volumes of the Gaither Homecoming Classics and enjoy the selections on each of them.  Truly Classic selections, hosted Bill and Gloria Gaither featuring their many Homecoming Friends.",1309651200,,1020,5.157575757575757
