8224545,1,B000WOQKJY,Doesn't play on American DVD Players!!! I even had the same seller send me another one because I thought the first disc was defective but had the same problem with the second one too! It's too bad they won't release a U.S. version because these ladies were really good and it's a shame they didn't do so well on this side of the world and that they decided to call it quits a few years ago.,1492387200,,390,4.144736842105263

8224548,5,B000WOQKJY,"this dvd is a must have for any Girls Aloud fan. It has everything you could ask for. It's only missing 7 music videos (and has 16) and the videos on this dvd have commentary with Cheryl and Sarah. Aside from this there are of course the style parts. If you're a girl and GA fan you're gonna love it, if you're a guy you can just skip it but either way... This is an amazing buy you won't regret.",1435190400,,396,3.9625

8224551,4,B000WOQKJY,"Girls Aloud's 4th DVD release is a MUST HAVE!!!! Not becuase of the style parts as that as very secondary and frankly wasn't needed. Most people who bought this will tell you they bought it for ONE reason only VIDEOS!!!!!. Yes GA's vid clips from Sound Of the Underground to Sexy(no,no,no) are on here and with commenary at that. Note: The commentary is only featuring Cheryl and Sarah as the other ladies were to busy to do it with them.
1.)Sound Of the Underground
2.)No Good Advice
3.)Life Got Cold
4.)Jump
5.)The Show
6.)Love Machine
7.)I'll Stand By You
8.)Wake Me Up
9.)Long Hot Summer
10.)Biology
11.)See The Day
12.)Whole Lotta History
13.)Something Kinda OOH
14.)I Think We're Alone Now
15.)Walk This Way(With the SugaBabes)
16.)Sexy(no,no,no)
I'm not going to give my opinions on the vids as that is what Chezza and Sarah's commentary is for. Enjoy but remember as with ALL GIRLS ALOUD DVD""s THIS IS PAL SO IT WILL WORK WITH REGION FREE DVD PLAYERS, PORTABLE DVD PLAYERS AND OR YOUR HOME COMPUTER.",1267574400,,1007,4.76
