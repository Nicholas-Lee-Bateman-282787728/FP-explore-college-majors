7879518,4,6304944985,"Superb!  As much a documentary about documentaries as about the Conquest of the Everest.  It gives credit where credit was due, correcting the notion that Hillary was the expedition leader.  When he was merely a second attempt climber...lucky enough to be teamed with the legendary Tenzing Norgay.",1413417600,,297,5.276595744680851
7879519,5,6304944985,"This film inspires all of us seeking a physical and spiritual challenge.  It is difficult to believe they achieved their goals with limited equipment and guidance.  If you are seeking a film about climbing in the Himalayas decades ago, you found it.",1374883200,,249,4.904761904761905
7879520,5,6304944985,This movie arrived on time and in good condition. It is a classic which shows the excitement and difficulty of conquering Everest with classic effects instead of the modern CGI.,1358208000,2,177,4.933333333333334
7879521,2,6304944985,"One of the antecedents of Reality Television. Shot by the BBC as they accompanied the British climbing expedition into Nepal and up the mountain. The music sucks by today's standards, as does most of the narration, but it's what worked in the period.  But the photography and the ordeal: amazing.",1289347200,2,296,4.92
7879522,4,6304944985,"Another reviewer claims ""the background music greatly adds to the entire production"".  Ha ha--the background music is terrible and melodramatic.  It distracts from the video.

The video quality is terrible and all the sound is after-the-fact voice-over or sound effects (sometimes to a silly degree--there's avalanches every few seconds for long periods of time).

Despite this, for hard-core Everest buffs like myself, I highly recommend getting this video.  It's interesting looking at the gear of the day and witnessing a historic event through contemporary video.",1232755200,2,567,5.623529411764705
7879523,5,6304944985,"Highly recommended and an asset to any collection. Being able to accomplish this most arduous climb with the sparse equipment that was in use those days is remarkable. Reproduction of past films and photos are excellent. Often overlooked, the background music greatly adds to the entire production.",1216252800,,298,5.361702127659575
7879524,5,6304944985,"I haven't seen this film since the 1950's, Million Dollar Movie, Channel 9 in NY. Great to see it again. Great to see people climb more of the mountain than today. I highly reccomend it to anyone who loves/likes climbing and/or camping.",1177372800,4,236,4.642857142857143
7879525,5,6304944985,"Well, we finally watched this video last week and is was truly a joy. We had no idea there was so much footage of this climb. Not all the way to the summit, but as far as the South Col camp the fantastic images were shot.
Ofcourse it is outdated, but that's exactly the charm of it:
All those tough men wearing few clothes, placing the first route through the Khumbu Icefall and the Lhotse face. With typical 'these heroical men' commentary.
They had no clue what to expect being at altitude so long and just went for it with a cheerful attitude.
No Goretex, no Imax, no fixed ropes up the Hillary step... but persistence and character.
Amazing images of a milestone in mountaineering history. You have to like the old images and the narrative style but it is imressive as well as humorous. The editing is also well done, at no moment is the movie boring in any way, something that current filmers can learn from.
Currently movie of the month [for us] as we recommend this one. Happy viewing!

7879526,4,6304944985,"Not to be confused with the awful TV movie Into Thin Air, based on the  bestselling Jon Krakauer novel. This is the actual film of Tenzing Norgay  and Edmund Hillary's historic first ascent of Mt. Everest. While not as  dramatic as other films on the subject (if only because the outcome is  known), it is none the less very well made, and an important historical  document in filmmaking. Some viewers today may feel the film is dated, and  even trite in spots. But the narrative moves very well, and its superb  historical content make up for that.",969062400,8,549,4.597938144329897
