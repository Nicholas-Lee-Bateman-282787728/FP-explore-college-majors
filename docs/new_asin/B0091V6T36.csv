8534477,5,B0091V6T36,"Rather than this simply being a story about a man who became a designer...this is a story about a man, and a designer.

More importantly - it's a novel look into the behind-the-scenes world of Fashion, devoid of the self-important grandeur and pomp that generally surrounds it.
.
I enjoyed this for the human aspect, the raw emotion - and the development of a story. You're elated when he succeeds, and...well I won't give away the rest.

Of course, take my word with a bit of salt, as I'm a Black 20-something, inspired by films like ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" and ""Gifted Hands""

but if you can imagine ""We Were Kings"" (Muhammad Ali) and Pursuit of Happyness merged into one, you've got this film.

worth the money",1372809600,,716,4.6141732283464565
