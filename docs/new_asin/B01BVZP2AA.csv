8751671,4,B01BVZP2AA,"The production dates back to a time when using DVDs for qigong instruction was still a novel endeavor.  In hindsight, I'm sure there is much the good doctor would have done different.  The student models serve in most instances as examples of how not to do a certain move--at least when it comes to fine details.  However, when one contrasts them with the limited footage of Dr. Yang doing a particular movement, one gains an appreciation of how it should be done.  There are some continuity issues from one move to the next.  For example, one form ends with a particular foot forward, and the next form begins with the opposite foot forward.  The turns introduced for practice in a limited space often result in a duplication of effort on one side.  The imperfections, however, will only serve to steel the resolve of the dedicated student (who will reason things out).  In the end, the overall quality of the video outweighs its faults.  Learning all five animal forms took me the better part of three months (setting aside 45 minutes to an hour per day outside my regular qigong regimen).  The DVD was well worth the price, especially when bundled with Understanding Qigong 4.",1505088000,,1179,4.735294117647059
