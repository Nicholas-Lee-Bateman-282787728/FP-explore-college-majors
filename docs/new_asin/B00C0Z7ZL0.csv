8576080,4,B00C0Z7ZL0,"Not bad 60's Euro-western starring Gordon Scott (my favorite Tarzan) and Joseph Cotton.  Scott has just returned from the Civil War tired of war and violence.  He returns to his home town just in time to see his land baron father hanging a Northerner just for being a Northerner.  Dad has completely gone off the rails and become the only law in the region, using his other sons as enforcers.  This guy's pilot light has gone out entirely.  He keeps his long-suffering wife and put-upon daughters upstairs, like he was some middle-Eastern potentate.  He still keeps slaves on his ranch.  Nice guy.  Sons Scott and Jim Mitchum turn against him and it all ends up in family warfare.  The quality of the DVD is very good.  One of the better European westerns.  Recommended.",1446940800,2,770,4.714285714285714

8576083,3,B00C0Z7ZL0,"Right on the cover it says ""spaghetti western collection"". I kid you not! Okay so now you know what you are getting into so I will spare you most of the bashing.  Dad and sons go off to fight in the Civil War, SPOILER: they lost. they come back to Texas and hang any Yankees that come to town. Gordon Scott, of Tarzan fame, disagrees with his dad and brothers. He and his sister and one brother leave etc. etc. You get it. Also in this are Joseph Cotton (nearing the end of his career?) and James Mitchum ( at the start of his and he kind of survived) it is predictable and ponderous, it is hokey and has the worst sound track EVER. It was painfully irritating. I did 3 stars, just because if you like these movies this is ok, if you don't steer clear.",1408406400,,752,4.115646258503402
8576084,3,B00C0Z7ZL0,"As a Euro-Western buff, I dug into this little known flick with high hopes. The results
were a bit disappointing. The film's storyline and visual production values are
mediocre. The landscapes and music, so much part of the allure of westerns, are
sub-par. Scott is okay, but the script and supporting cast, despite the great Joseph
Cotton, do little to up the interest in this forgettable frontier family drama. Much is
made of the early Franco Nero, but again, without the Italian Western flourishes,
this is flat movie-making on mostly flat terrain.",1389830400,2,552,5.010869565217392
8576085,4,B00C0Z7ZL0,"This is an above average spaghetti western, featuring Gordon Scott fresh off his stint as Tarzan.  Joseph Cotton and James Mitchum (son of Robert) round out the American cast of players.  Set in the post Civil War era, Scott plays the son of cattle baron Cotton, returning home to find a devastated Texas and a father who's not the man he once was.  Witness to the hanging of an innocent man, Scott strikes out on his own, putting him in direct opposition to his family.  Tensions mount, as does the body count, until a final, climatic confrontation.  Recommended for fans of these Italian oaters.",1379980800,5,597,4.701923076923077

From Wild East Productions, On time  delivery from Amazon. Gordon Scott was famous for his roles in playing Tarzan in 1950s

8576087,5,B00C0Z7ZL0,"Wild East Productions has released a rare Spaghetti Western from the year in which the genre was making its presence known and marks its US debut in Digital format.  Director Albert Band's aka Alfredo Antonini's 'THE TRAMPLERS' aka 'GLI UOMINI DAL PASSO PASANTE' aka 'LAS PISTOLAS DEL NORTE DE TEXAS'-1966 is a tough tragedy resembling American oaters such as Director Edward Dmytrik's 'BROKEN LANCE'-1954 but utilizing many Euro touches such as its erupting brutality and gritty performances.  Actor Joseph Cotton plays megalomaniac Temple Cordeen, an ex-confederate officer who refuses to accept the civil war is over and uses his twisted code of honor to protect his lands by utilizing his sons and hired thugs to create a reign of terror.  Trouble starts when two sons played by Gordon Scott and Jim Mitchum and his daughters decide to rebel culminating into a climatic inevitable blood bath.  This is one of Scott's three spaghetti's that he made in the mid sixties in Italy.  Known for his excellent turn as Tarzan in the late fifties and many muscleman pepla's in the early sixties, he shines in this role making it a shame that he didn't do more westerns. Mitchum is good also which makes it a shame that he never got better roles as the years went on. Cotten is excellent as the lead and would make many memorable Euro titles up until the seventies. The film also marks the debut of two prolific actors who helped form the Spaghetti genre:  Francesco Spartanero aka Franco Nero (here billed as Frank Nero in the credits) makes his first Spaghetti Western appearance coming off his role in Director John Huston's 'THE BIBLE'-'1966' and would go onto stardom in Director Sergio Corbucci's classic 'DJANGO'-1966; and actor Romano Puppo who would grace countless genre titles some uncredited but who's face makes the standout stamp.  You will also recognize a blink or you'll miss cameo by venerable Claudio Gora in a brutally violent turn at the film's 10 minute mark.  Director Band was an indefatigable film maker who wrote, produced and directed hundreds of films in his career and along with his son Charles Band formed Empire Pictures in the eighties.  He would also take this films idea and along with Director Sergio Corbucci would lens the underrated 'THE HELLBENDERS' aka 'I CRUDELI' aka 'THE CRUEL ONES' the same year also starring Joseph Cotten in an identical role.  The films credits also boast first rate photography by Alvaro Mancore , an assistant director turn by future director Franco Prosperi and a haunting score by Angelo Francesco Lavagnino who's mostly known for his score for Director Eugene Lourie's giant monster movie 'GORGO'- 1961.  Keen viewers will also spot the Cordeen mansion as the one utilized in Director Frank Kramer's aka Gianfranco Parolini's 'SABATA' aka 'EH, AMICO...C'E SABATA, HAI CHUISO!'-1969 and its sequel 'RETURN OF SABATA' aka' E TORNATO SABATA, HAI CHUISO UN ALTRA VOLTA'-1972.  Wild East gives the film a nice 1.85 widescreen transfer showing an Avco Embassy release moniker with Italian credits and English dubbing.  The only extras are a poster and stills gallery and both US and Italian trailers for the film. An excellent addition to any Western collection, it shows actor Gordon Scott at the peak of his art and thanks again, Wild East , for releasing this rarity to fans and giving it the respect it truly deserves.",1366761600,10,3379,4.980461811722913
8576088,1,B00C0Z7ZL0,"I ordered this video from an Amazon vendor in Florida.  Unfortunately, I was never able to view it because it arrived broken.  I did get my money back from Amazon after the vendor refused to exchange it.  I originally ordered this video because I had met Gordon Scott at one time in Portland, Oregon and thought it would be fun to see him in a Western instead of as Tarzan.  I don't know if there is a biography out on Gordon Scott, but I understand that he lived his later life as a recluse until his death. And, that is too bad, because he was a very handsome, outgoing actor at the time I met him.  I would still like a copy of Tramplers if it ever comes out on DVD.",1233532800,5,669,4.076335877862595
