I got more understanding how to  make rosebuds in an easy fashion
I have already took a lesson but I still need smething to  look at time to time to refresh my memory
I would recomend it to someone  that is interest in cake decorating",1373068800,,309,3.935483870967742
8290243,1,B001CWKF0K,"I bought this video based on the reviews posted and I was absolutely disappointed once I got the product. Very cheap quality, it looks like (actually, I am certain) it was recorded with a cheap home video camera and reproduced to sell. The lady giving the presentation is extremely boring, I was ready to shoot myself after 10 minutes watching. Nothing new that the Wilton video won't show for a much better price and 100% professional production. The teenagers in my family have produced much better products at a much better price. Believe me, buy a book. It's less boring or simply go to you tube. It's free. Do not spend almost 30 dollars in this useless object!",1319932800,,666,4.6525423728813555
8290244,5,B001CWKF0K,I was very pleased with this DVD. Lot's of close ups and very well explained. I am new to cake decorating but not for long and I am sure I'll be turning out a well decorated cake very soon.,1307836800,2,189,3.871794871794872
