8404146,5,B003SC0D18,"The best DVD for moms to be who want to breastfeed.  Not only does Shari do a wonderful job of explaining why breastfeeding is best for both baby and mom, she gives very practical info on how to do it and stick with it when difficulties arise.  This is really a ""how to""  for something that everyone thinks comes naturally but really doesn't.",1406246400,,342,4.396825396825397
8404147,5,B003SC0D18,"I did not breastfeed my first child, so when I was pregnant with my second I wanted to find user friendly resources so I could try breastfeeding again. I found many breastfeeding tomes that were overwhelming in their scope and I wanted something a bit more focused on just getting started with my newborn. Simply Breastfeeding is just what I needed. It really appealed to my visual learning style, and Shari's instruction is very conversational and easy to follow. This dvd and the book Breastfeeding Solutions by Nancy Mohrbacher helped me get started and trouble shoot my issues with breastfeeding.",1376956800,,600,5.01

8404149,4,B003SC0D18,"This DVD had a lot of information and overall I would recommend it even though it could be better. It is very clear that the host is trying to instill confidence in moms to continue breastfeeding and warns new moms that it will be very hard the first few weeks. She tries to give the viewer as much information as possible so that they will not give up. The following are the tips that I found to be the most helpful:

The size and capacity of your baby's stomach (in ounces):
Day 1: 1/4 oz (size of a thimble)
Day 3: 1/2 oz (size of your baby's fist)
Day 10: 1  - 2 oz (size of a golf ball)

Limit the length of feeding on each side to prevent sore nipples before the milk comes in:
On day 1 - 5 minutes max.
On day 2 - 7 minutes max.
On day 3 - 10 minutes max.

Ways to soften the engorged breast to make the latch easier:
1. Express a little bit of milk with your hand or your pump (just enough to soften the nipple).
2. Gently massage the breast in the direction of the armpit (helps the fluid reabsorb into the lymph system).
3. Apply cabbage leaves to the breast (limit the length of time to 10-20 minutes, as it can work too well and dry the milk).

When normal growth spurts typically occur. Don't panic that you don't have enough milk and give up when it seems like baby is hungry all the time.

Instructions for introducing the bottle:
1 week after birth:
Before the first feeding in the morning pump  ounce into a bottle and then breastfeed the baby. Store that breastmilk in the refrigerator. In the evening give the baby the breastmilk (that you pumped that morning) in the bottle and finish the feeding at the breast.
Continue to do this each evening to keep the bottle going.
The purpose of giving  ounce from the bottle is not to supplement a feeding - it is just to keep the bottle introduced.
It is recommended that you do not pump breastmilk for storage within the first 6 weeks (while your milk supply is being established). Doing so may result in over-supply and engorgement and you want to produce only as much milk as your baby needs.

6 weeks after birth:
After 6 weeks you will have established your milk supply and you will be able to pump for storage and supplement an entire feeding with the bottle.
We have found that the best time to pump for storage is in the morning when you have the most milk. Before the first feeding in the morning, pump into a bottle from one breast (2-4 ounces), and then breastfeed the baby from the other breast. Store the milk in the refrigerator or freezer to supplement an entire feeding at another time when you cannot be with your baby or just want to feed from the bottle.
Pump only one bottle per day for storage.

Negatives:

The format is kind of boring since it's mostly the host talking, with very little interaction with the small class. The set is really boring as well. But I kept watching because the information was helpful. There were a few clips of a real mom breastfeeding her newborn which were helpful, but I wanted to see more demonstrations of different breastfeeding positions with real moms and babies.",1361232000,5,3118,4.331046312178388
