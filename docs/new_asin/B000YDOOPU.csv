3028099,5,B000YDOOPU,"Maybe I was just in the right mood for the film, but I thought it was a great movie. It gave a refreshing truth about relationships (you really can't guarantee anything). This movie does have a few twists and turns that may question your faith in marriage, but overall I enjoyed the realistic edge. I wouldn't recommend for someone looking for an uplifting/feel good romantic movie.",1371859200,2,382,4.803030303030303

3028101,4,B000YDOOPU,Quirky characters and story. Fun. Scenes of the Upper West Side and lifestyles compelling. May not appeal to people not familiar with New York City.,1367625600,,148,4.96
3028102,5,B000YDOOPU,It was very thought-provoking and forces you to reflect. Addresses lots of social issues but still in a way that is fun and light. Great movie!,1367539200,,143,4.538461538461538
3028103,1,B000YDOOPU,I only watched it a short time and felt it was a stupid movie and as such was a waste of my time to watch.,1366675200,,106,3.28
3028104,3,B000YDOOPU,"If this movie was a meal, it wouldn't be a balanced meal with the four major food groups, it'd be more like a Twinkie. It won't kill you but you wouldn't want to live on it either.

Some of the dialogue is amusing, the characters are mostly likable if a bit cliche, and the plot though far-fetched is amusing. Imagine if Larry David had somehow been cast as one of the roommates in Friends, and he got mixed up with Phoebe. This film seemed a little like that. The male lead had the narcism of Larry David and the simpy delivery of ""Ross"". And the female lead is pretty much Mother Theresa delivered via ""Phoebe"".

If the two leads are the sugary cream filling, the supporting characters - in particular Fred Willard - are the golden sponge cake holding the thing together. The scenes featuring the broader cast and any time Fred Willard is on screen, were some of the highlights for me.

Overall a decent, easy to consume, not gonna make you a better person kind of thing. Not as good as a balanced meal, but not as bad as eating frosting out of a can",1366156800,6,1052,4.32994923857868
3028105,2,B000YDOOPU,"I rented this because of Chris Messina and he is the most annoying character in the film!  Geez, just get over yourself already.  On the flipside, I am usually annoyed by Jennifer Westfeldt and she is surprisingly good here, flaky but so likeable.  I guess it's all about the writing after all.  The storyline is silly, I found it difficult to finish watching.  View as a last resort if your house is spotless and you really have nothing better to do.",1365897600,,451,4.518518518518518

3028108,4,B000YDOOPU,I really liked the characters in this story. It is a well written story. I would recommend it to a friend.,1363219200,,106,4.095238095238095
3028109,5,B000YDOOPU,"I have watched it several times each time sharing it with someone new...

3028110,5,B000YDOOPU,Westfeldt knocks this one out of the park. A solid cast puts into play a very enjoyable script. Perhaps the circumstances are a bit difficult to bite into but what a delicious bite. A well thought out and carefully submitted modern day message with a lively and lovable Westfeldt center stage. Hoping this one pops out on Blu Ray sometime soon. It easily makes my collection.,1346630400,,375,4.696969696969697
3028111,3,B000YDOOPU,"We're supposed to believe 2 strangers in NYC meet and decide that day to get married with no questions asked.  Both have exes with unfinished business and zany colorful parents with problems of their own.  On top of that, almost every character is either in therapy or are therapists themselves.  I suppose given those constraints, the script isn't too bad.  If you love Woody Allen type stuff it's ok.",1344297600,6,402,4.782608695652174
3028112,5,B000YDOOPU,"I watched this on a whim and so glad I did. A different spin on romantic comedy, this refreshing film includes love/marriage in its many phases.  The characters are compelling, the acting is spledid. I felt connected to each and felt their emotion.  Not too zany, not too depressing;  just real, raw and in the moment. Fun and engaging.",1337644800,,336,4.661016949152542
3028113,1,B000YDOOPU,"The front of the DVD says ""The Best Manhattan Love Story Since When Harry Met Sally"". So, I was expecting something fantastic. I couldn't make it past the first half hour. These two are such losers and to compare them to Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan is a joke. Ira & Abby are irritating, unsophisticated, and kind of dumb.

3028114,5,B000YDOOPU,"I loved the film.  It is light and entertaining and great fun.  This movie is about inlaws, marriage and divorce with a comical twist.  I think you will have a fun time here!",1332028800,,174,4.212121212121212
3028115,5,B000YDOOPU,"Just a funny movie! There are also some girlie scenes (my wife loved that stuff). Basically, this is an excellent movie to watch with your mate.",1306713600,,144,4.576923076923077
3028116,4,B000YDOOPU,"I enjoyed watching the neurotic characters Ira & Abby, loved the actress who played Abby (I first saw her in ""Kissing Jessica Stein""), & loved the actor who played Ira (he is hilarious, had some of the funniest lines in the movie!). Highly recommend it, laughed through much of this movie at how it pokes fun at the craziness and reality of love, relationships, and psychotherapy.",1303776000,,380,4.7727272727272725
3028117,4,B000YDOOPU,"Pretty far into this film I was thinking, ""wow, this is a great movie!"" and planning on giving it 5 stars.  Unfotunately, instead of just focussing on the main couple, the last third or so really drags by bringing in in-laws, exes, blah blah, just too much.  There are several weddings in the movie and I would have ended it at the second (not to give anything away).
But I'm still going to give it 4 stars for originality, a GREAT cast, being overall entertaining, and being smarter than the average romantic comedy.",1293926400,5,517,4.548387096774194
3028118,4,B000YDOOPU,"Ira Black can't finish anything.  He can't commit to his girlfriend Lea, nor can he finish his doctoral dissertation.  His analyst parents are no help; their solution to all Ira's problems is to offer to pay for therapy.  When Ira joins a gym, he's smitten by the salesperson, Abby.  They get married.  Ira begins to find fault with Abby--she lacks ambition.  Of course, he's still not finishing anything.  The shrinks get involved and things get complicated for everyone for a while before working themselves out.

The supporting cast is wonderful, and everyone obviously had fun making this endearing little film.  Fans of Larry David and Woody Allen should put this on their must-see list.  Special features include director/producer's commentary, outtakes and deleted scenes.

The reason I didn't rate this five stars is that Ira and Abby only commit themselves to each other for ""as long as it lasts"" which means nothing, and certainly isn't marriage.  That was the only dumb aspect of an otherwise smart movie.",1276905600,,1016,5.054216867469879

3028120,5,B000YDOOPU,"My new favorite movie. I've always been a sucker for a decent romantic comedy (honestly what 20-something woman isnt?) but this one has definitely moved to the top of my list. Ira and Abby are both lovable characters and their relationship (even with its ups and downs) is the kind we all want to have. Highly recommended to people who like romantic comedies (Sleepless in Seattle, My Best Friend's Wedding, etc) and fans of realistic comedy like Woody Allen, Seinfeld, and so on.",1255564800,,480,4.795180722891566
3028121,4,B000YDOOPU,"A movie you can relate to.  I rented this movie and after viewing it, I had to have my own copy to watch when I needed reminders of how crazy life and relationships can be.",1247443200,,172,3.914285714285714
3028122,4,B000YDOOPU,"""Ira & Abby"" pairs Chris Messina from ""Humboldt County"" with Jennifer Westfeldt from ""Kissing Jessica Stein.""  Westfeldt wrote the screenplay and delivers a quirky offbeat performance as Abby, a woman who sees the world differently.  Messina's Ira is a guy who has a lot of ability, but can't quite put the pieces together.  Both sets of parents also play prominently.  Ira's mother Arlene is played by TV's ""Who's the Boss"" star Judith Light.  Arlene's classy elegance and ice queen exterior is given depth and shading by Light's performance, with the scene in the recording studio being her best moment.  Robert Klein plays Ira's dad Seymore, a bit of a putts for a professional guy.  The film's relationships kind of mirror TV's ""Dharma & Greg"" with Ira's parents being uptown, wealthy and professional and Abby's parents being more the free spirit/hippy types.  Fred Willard plays Abby's dad Michael who does voice-overs for a living.  Frances Conroy who worked with Chris Messina on the last year of TV's ""Six Feet Under"" plays the hippy mother Lynne.  This oddball comic romp seems to crash to the conclusion that marriage cannot sustain true love but rather smothers it.  While I'm not personally sure that I agree with this, I did enjoy the film, the characters and their romance.  Enjoy!",1245974400,,1296,4.976744186046512
3028123,3,B000YDOOPU,"I suppose I would give this three and a half stars if that rating were available. This movie provided me with 100 minutes of entertainment. No deep thinking, no real surprises...just a romantic comedy about 3 couples who can't quite figure out what the heck they are doing or what they want. The acting was okay, especially the actress who played Abby. She was very good. It was not nearly as funny as I remember ""When Harry Met Sally"" being, but then again, these actors are not Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan!

I would not rush out to get this DVD, but if it lands in your lap, watch it.",1207785600,,585,4.318181818181818
3028124,3,B000YDOOPU,"Ira and Abbey started off promising. It's funny and well written with a decent main actor in Chris Messina who was featured in a few episodes of Six Feet Under. And the supporting cast is really impressive--Jason Alexander, Fred Willard, and Frances Conroy, also of Six Feet Under (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Six-Feet-Under-The-Complete-Series-Gift-Set/dp/B000HEVZBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Six Feet Under - The Complete Series Gift Set</a>

For most people, it's like an updated version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/When-Harry-Met-Sally/dp/B00003CXDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">When Harry Met Sally...</a>. A neurotic Jewish guy and an extremely nice white girl struggle with love. This time, however, the couple jumps immediately--and I do mean immediately--into marriage. Then the trouble begins.

The movie tells us that what we may view as a perfect marriage is really a sham of lies and false impressions. What we see as a flawed marriage may really be quite healthy in its own sad, resigned way. And the kids of these marriages have no idea what to think. They jump into the institution and get embroiled in therapy to help themselves cope.

What allows Ira and Abbey to finally save their relationship from all of this turmoil? Well, I can't say becuase that would give it away. Let's just say, however, that this really is a modern retelling of When Harry Met Sally. Watch that movie now, and it almost seems quaint. Ira and Abbey isn't quaint, but it's almost stupidly radical. The solution to everything is so ridiculous that I almost hope people do not watch this movie and resort to thinking the solution may work for them, too.

I still give it three stars, however, because overall, it's a pretty good movie. I enjoyed it throughout, for it's almost a refreshingly smart romantic comedy. Except at the end, when I felt like I had been duped.",1207094400,7,1951,5.581081081081081
3028125,5,B000YDOOPU,"I just loved this movie.  It had an interesting, rather novel storyline to back up the romance and, fortunately, very good actors that carry the story.  Rent it, buy it, watch it!  (I also fell in love with one of the groups that sings one of the songs in the movie -- check out ""The 88"".)",1205971200,3,289,4.125

Absolutely delightful.  A lovely movie about the ups and downs of the relationship of a young couple questioning whether the only path to happiness is ""I do.""  A must see for young and old.  Elizabeth",1204588800,3,336,7.121951219512195

3262619,4,B000YDOOPU,"""Ira & Abby"" pairs Chris Messina from ""Humboldt County"" with Jennifer Westfeldt from ""Kissing Jessica Stein.""  Westfeldt wrote the screenplay and delivers a quirky offbeat performance as Abby, a woman who sees the world differently.  Messina's Ira is a guy who has a lot of ability, but can't quite put the pieces together.  Both sets of parents also play prominently.  Ira's mother Arlene is played by TV's ""Who's the Boss"" star Judith Light.  Arlene's classy elegance and ice queen exterior is given depth and shading by Light's performance, with the scene in the recording studio being her best moment.  Robert Klein plays Ira's dad Seymore, a bit of a putts for a professional guy.  The film's relationships kind of mirror TV's ""Dharma & Greg"" with Ira's parents being uptown, wealthy and professional and Abby's parents being more the free spirit/hippy types.  Fred Willard plays Abby's dad Michael who does voice-overs for a living.  Frances Conroy who worked with Chris Messina on the last year of TV's ""Six Feet Under"" plays the hippy mother Lynne.  This oddball comic romp seems to crash to the conclusion that marriage cannot sustain true love but rather smothers it.  While I'm not personally sure that I agree with this, I did enjoy the film, the characters and their romance.  Enjoy!",1245974400,,1296,4.976744186046512
3262620,3,B000YDOOPU,"I suppose I would give this three and a half stars if that rating were available. This movie provided me with 100 minutes of entertainment. No deep thinking, no real surprises...just a romantic comedy about 3 couples who can't quite figure out what the heck they are doing or what they want. The acting was okay, especially the actress who played Abby. She was very good. It was not nearly as funny as I remember ""When Harry Met Sally"" being, but then again, these actors are not Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan!

I would not rush out to get this DVD, but if it lands in your lap, watch it.",1207785600,,585,4.318181818181818
3262621,3,B000YDOOPU,"Ira and Abbey started off promising. It's funny and well written with a decent main actor in Chris Messina who was featured in a few episodes of Six Feet Under. And the supporting cast is really impressive--Jason Alexander, Fred Willard, and Frances Conroy, also of Six Feet Under (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Six-Feet-Under-The-Complete-Series-Gift-Set/dp/B000HEVZBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Six Feet Under - The Complete Series Gift Set</a>

For most people, it's like an updated version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/When-Harry-Met-Sally/dp/B00003CXDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">When Harry Met Sally...</a>. A neurotic Jewish guy and an extremely nice white girl struggle with love. This time, however, the couple jumps immediately--and I do mean immediately--into marriage. Then the trouble begins.

The movie tells us that what we may view as a perfect marriage is really a sham of lies and false impressions. What we see as a flawed marriage may really be quite healthy in its own sad, resigned way. And the kids of these marriages have no idea what to think. They jump into the institution and get embroiled in therapy to help themselves cope.

What allows Ira and Abbey to finally save their relationship from all of this turmoil? Well, I can't say becuase that would give it away. Let's just say, however, that this really is a modern retelling of When Harry Met Sally. Watch that movie now, and it almost seems quaint. Ira and Abbey isn't quaint, but it's almost stupidly radical. The solution to everything is so ridiculous that I almost hope people do not watch this movie and resort to thinking the solution may work for them, too.

I still give it three stars, however, because overall, it's a pretty good movie. I enjoyed it throughout, for it's almost a refreshingly smart romantic comedy. Except at the end, when I felt like I had been duped.",1207094400,7,1951,5.581081081081081

Absolutely delightful.  A lovely movie about the ups and downs of the relationship of a young couple questioning whether the only path to happiness is ""I do.""  A must see for young and old.  Elizabeth",1204588800,3,336,7.121951219512195
