5131083,5,B0084I0LLI,"I saw this movie at a screening and was able to speak with Pierce and Trine.  It is a delightful story with one of the bravest performances I have ever witnessed from Trine Dyrholm.  Yes, it's quiet and simple but it's ever so honest and beautiful.  I have deep affection for both Denmark and Italy so this was a love letter for me, personally.

FYI:  Trine shaved her head for this so the scenes of her hair regrowth would be real.  There is an even braver choice she made in this film.  Trine is truly wonderful and I will be looking for any work that she does in the future.  The rest of the cast was spot on and that adds up to brilliant direction by Susanne Bier.

I am so thrilled to have found the DVD for sale.",1374710400,24,718,4.107913669064748
5131084,4,B0084I0LLI,How odd that this film is only available with Italian subtitles this summer---  even in Denmark (Susanne Bier's film)??

5131085,2,B0084I0LLI,"This film was well done but much too graphic for it's target audience. If you're looking to get a message through to a young person that gays are okay and bullying is not, this film does the job. But it is sickening. It puts images (spoiler here) of suicide in their minds. I would not recommend this film for that particular reason.",1373500800,,333,4.387096774193548

Saw it on a cold, gloomy day in June, and it was a day brightener.  The mix of Danish and English languages seemed very natural to me.  The actors stirred the pot of emotions nicely, and oh, that sister-in-law!  The movie had lots of little ""moments,"" and the kinds of relationship messes that humans tend to create for themselves. Glad I went to Sorrento with Pierce and the gang.",1370476800,23,534,4.510416666666667
5131087,4,B0084I0LLI,"Chick Flick Alert! ""Den skaldede frisr"" (English captions) is a Danish film about a hairdresser who has been fighting breast cancer. After a partial mastectomy and chemo, she gets the all-clear, but comes home only to discover her husband having a fling with a co-worker. Problem is, next week they are flying from Denmark to Italy for their daughter's wedding. Of course Dean Martin's ""That's Amore"" underscores the opening credits.

Writer Suzanne Bier (""After the Wedding"" - terrific by the way!) directed this award-winning romance that features:
  * Trine Dyrholm (""The Royal Affair"") is Ida, the bald hairdresser (nice wig though) who has to confront one serious upset after another. She's the mother of the bride.
  * Pierce Brosnan (""The Ghost Writer"") is Philip, a highly successful international trader of fresh fruits and vegetables. It's his Italian villa where the wedding party convenes. He's the widowed father of the groom.
  * Sebastian Jessen (""Almost Perfect"") is Patrick, the groom...but he's starting to wonder....
  * Molly Blixt Egelind (""Rebounce"") is Astrid, the bride. The groom's wondering is making her start to wonder...
  * Paprika Steen (""Keep the Lights On"") is Benedikte, the worst sister-in-law EVER!

Things get off to a bad start when the mother of the bride backs her car into the father of the groom's car at the airport in Copenhagen. Then they are on the same flight but HER luggage gets lost. Finally, her wandering husband brings along his new sweetheart to Italy because she missed her flight back to Denmark. (She introduces herself as his ""fiance."")

I'll bet you have it all figured out, don't you? Well, you don't. I love it when things become unpredictable, and they do! Expect no sweaty bodies, gunshots, vehicular mayhem or blowie uppie stuff. In fact the biggest villain is that philandering husband.

BTW, Brosnan just gets more appealing as the years go by. He's far better now than when he was 'Bond'ing with the world. Yum! Amazon will notify me when the DVD is available.",1369440000,45,2027,5.011940298507462
5131088,5,B0084I0LLI,"I think this short film has a very powerful message. The Gay community is constantly getting bullied for liking the same sex. But in this movie, it's the other way around. It's gays bullying a Teen girl for liking boys. This movie shows how much judging on someone's Sexuality hurts. and in some cases lead to irreversible actions.",1368144000,,331,4.724137931034483
5131089,5,B0084I0LLI,"I bought this DVD in hopes that it would be a wonderful tool to show to not only my friends but my children as well. WOW DID IT DELIVER!!! Love is All You Need? has a wonderful way of putting the shoe on the other foot to teach a great lesson about bullying and even homophobia without coming across preachy! The cast is spectacular and the little girl seems to really capture the dark world of an 11 yr old feeling tortured.. AND they manage to get ya completely wrapped up into the story and characters in just 18minutes!!!! I would suggest this film for children and adults 10yrs-Up. If you show it to your kids or anyone with the intentions of using it as a teaching tool.. PLEASE DISCUSS IT AFTER.. Don't just expect the film to teach the lesson on its own.. Its up to you to take the lesson to a whole new level...

As far as just buying the short for entertainment purposes.. YOU WILL NOT BE LET DOWN! Its a wonderful and beautiful story and visually beautiful!

I hope you all enjoy it as much as i did! Together we can make a difference!",1337644800,,1046,4.251256281407035

I read that Pierce Brosnan suggested everal music selections but these were rejected.  I read also that it was the director who insisted on That's Amore.  The proper music can add as much to a movie as the proper actor, or in this case director.  The movie is certainly worth seeing, wonderfully acted by both Trrne Dryholm and Pierce Brosnan.  I did not enjoy the ""couple who were to be married"" and their situation was so obvious, that a 10 year old could have figured it it.

5131178,4,B0084I0LLI,"Love Is All You Need Zentropa/Sony Entertainment 2013 Rated R  DVD

The jacket for this movie looks as if it were made circa 1940.  In fact the title could be from 1940 as well.  I guess they were going for a timeless story.

Pierce Brosnan has the male lead here, which is why I watched it.  I really liked him as James Bond, but had only seen him in one other non-Bond movie.  In this case hes an English ex-patriate running a fruit wholesale business based in Denmark and with interests in Italy.  The only plausible reason why he would be based in Denmark, as far as I can see, is because the lead female Trine Dyrholm is Danish.

This is straight-up a romance story and it is a romance for the aging baby-boomer set.  Trines character Ida seems incurably optimistic, no matter how grim her circumstances.  Her sweetheart of several decades ago has turned out to be a loathsome boor in middle-age.  Their daughter Astrid has fallen in love with Patrick, who happens to be Brosnans son [I mean, with Philips sonand does Philip even HAVE a last name?]  Everyone is traveling to Sorrento Italy for their wedding because it happens to be Philips estate from his marriage.  He tragically lost his wife in an accident and he seemed never to recover from that loss, having remained a bachelor ever since.

To produce the requisite tensions for the love story there have to be many obstacles.  Obstacles abound: Philips inability to get over his prior loss; Idas attempt to salvage her marriage; questions about Patricks degree of attraction to Astrid; the difficulty of handling a newish relationship while also battling serious illness [to explain more would be a spoiler].

This was billed as romantic comedy, but it is not particularly comedic.  Maybe they felt obliged to put it that way, to indicate it is not a tragedy.  Really it is just a love story.  And there are few places as visually charming as Sorrento Italy in which to film this tale.  Pierce Brosnan having lost his first wife some years ago to ovarian cancer, I thought that it may have been very tough for him to play a character still grieving the loss of his wife.  He did well with his part, as did Trine with hers.

There are a couple of minor rough points with the plot, characterization and such, but overall this is a good film.  If you don't expect comedy and you do enjoy a mature love story, you should like the film.  I did.",1467676800,,2402,4.543123543123543

I love the story of a courageous woman who looks at life with such a positive and strong outlook no matter what is thrown at her. And she gets her rewards along the way. What a woman to emulate.

I utterly fell in love with Dyrholm's character as I watched Brosnan's do the same, and I can absolutely relate to Brosnan's character -- finding yourself drawn to someone unexpectedly, and despite your best intentions and beliefs about your own romantic capacity.

The title is insipid, and the original was for more compelling (The Bald Hairdresser).

The cinematography is gorgeous, and does justice to Italy.

The only real downside is the mediocre screenplay.  The story needs work, and could've been quite a bit improved...

5131249,3,B0084I0LLI,"Months ago, I had done a review on the movie Italians for Beginners. Describing it as a very good film, but a conventional romantic comedy that got layers of realism thanks to the Dogme 95 rules Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg had set up for their project. Which made me say that if it hadn't been for that film circle, I probably wouldn't have watched that film, nor any other stories of that genre that tends to be too formulaic and stereotypical.

An observation that I ended up not doing as I watched this romantic comedy by Suzanne Bier and Thomas Anders Jensen called ""Love is All you Need"". The story of a hairdresser in remission from Breast cancer who, as she gets ready to leave for Italy for the wedding of her daughter, finds out that her husband has been cheating with his job's accountant. Whcih makes her leave in a very upset mood though she ends up finding a potential flame in a very harsh businessman played by Pierce Brosnan. Though that love comes days later as they get acquainted better in the days before the wedding. And after what happens then.

So why did I watch such a movie with such a conventional and predictable synopsis and genre?

Well, the reason is that I had read months ago about Lars von trier's criticism of Suzanne Bier and Thomas Anders Jensen's films. Which people had found scandalous, as in everything that is really well stated and honest and not covered up in Hollywood game PR statements, but which makes sense as their kind of films, if you check at their IMDB and Wikipedia lists, are more classical, Hollywood-oriented, and viewer-preoccupied than what Lars would do with his films where he twists up genres in their rules and prejudices. Making masterpieces like his perfect Breaking the Waves, Dancer in the Dark, The Idiots, Antichrist, and Melancholia, latter film who also has its share of wedding reception. Fables of marvellous realism that have upset and infuriated many for their genial way of reinventing our definition of cinema. But even though I read all those criticisms, I decided to take a chance and look at what Bier and Jensen offered in this film as they had done quite a lot of films together. Give them a chance to see how they could treat this type of romance.

And yes you can clearly see that Bier and Jensen do tread on a deja-vu path with this comedy. Predictable synopsis, a romantic location very cliched, and a denouement I think everyone can guess right off. Though I have to say it's nice for once to have a romantic comedy without stupid slapstick jokes like in American movies. A humour that is much more subtle and real than Hollywood's relentless droning. Also, it offers a cinematography of Italy and Denmark that is just gorgeous to look at. And with the soundtrack they used, some tunes were still in my head after the film ended. A music for which Bier made clever use of the movie's silences and moments to add to the film's tension instead of killing it with a never-ending and pleonastic soundtrack like the makers of ""Honeymoon for One"" ended up doing.

Nevertheless, I found that certain parts of the script were weak. First before the wedding as we have a subplot between Pierce's character's Sister-in-law who still has feelings for her brother-in-law. With the woman saying stuff about Trine Dyrholm's character that lacked dramatic necessity as that character never gets involved in that subplot. And two, some parts of the story were more interesting than what the movie was offering. Especially the adulterous husband and his reasons as to why he cheated on his wife that I felt were too archetypical under Bier's camera and Jensen's quill and could have been much richer, or even the groom's issues that revealed something more dramatic and actual as many people like him have fallen into the conventions of wedding for reasons they are trying to escape. In short, I found other parts of the film more interesting than what this script had to offer and felt that they should have been developped as films rather than this story.

However, I still think ""Love is all you need"" remains a good film. With very good and convincing actors, a neat visual direction and a nice plot to pass up for a rainy day that doesn't rely on Hollywood slapstick and stupid one-liners we all know about right from the trailers.

A movie that is more interesting to purchase if you like conventional storytelling. Which isn't too bad in itself, but may detract others who might find romantic comedy's conventions too predictable.",1448928000,,4517,4.724619289340102

One family is spending the other family's money. One woman is in the bathroom telling her daughter to shove her fingers down her throat and throw up.

Well this is what this gross movie is about. But of course all the problems go away because two people ""fall in love"" . . . Hollywood's made up solution to everything.

And what is equally annoying is that the characters switch indiscriminately from speaking Danish to English and back. And when they have subtitles they make sure you cannot read them with the crazy background half obscuring the words.",1434326400,4,1049,4.544973544973545

5131292,4,B0084I0LLI,"Though the plot is improbable, and the film is populated with some annoying characters, I loved the acting of the main characters, Trine Dyrholm and Pierce Brosnan. Both are beautiful to look at as well as vulnerable, and have nice chemistry on screen. They play the parents of a young couple who are going to be wed soon in a disused lemon orchard and villa in Sorrento owned by dad (Brosnan). The beautiful Bay of Naples and scenes from Sorrento play a starring role in the film.

Trine Dyrholm, a Danish actress, plays Ida, the mother of the bride-to-be and is still recovering from breast cancer. The actress actually shaved her head and wore a wig to lend authenticity to the part. She has really luminous blue eyes that light up the screen in all her close-ups. She finds her husband ""in flagrante delicto"" with a younger woman while Ida was presumably having a cancer treatment. His excuse was that this had been a hard time for him too.

Pierce Brosnan plays the workaholic widowed father of the husband-to-be, content with his solitary life and believing that life and love have passed him by. Of course, you can guess the outcome just from looking at the DVD cover, so I won't reveal any plot spoilers.

Most of the film was in English, and the Danish dialogue had English subtitles. Though there are a few comedic scenes in the movie, I wouldn't categorize it as a rom-com. It's mostly about people who have been disappointed in their relationships, and how they continue to look for love.",1431907200,,1500,4.652830188679245

5131333,4,B0084I0LLI,"I really liked this movie. Mostly English language with some Danish and Italian thrown in. I'm a fan of Pierce Brosnan and he did not disappoint in this film. Ida is at the end of her treatment for breast cancer. Clearly it's been devastating, but her good nature, sense of humor and her deep love of her family have kept her going. Then she finds out her husband is having an affair and btw, he is a clueless idiot. Although it's no excuse, he is blindly ignorant of the effect of his actions. It is a question put to Ida later in the film as to what she ever saw in him in the first place. Phillip is a bitter widower. He is very successful and polished, but has never moved passed the death of his wife. Although Phillip and Ida have never met, his son and her daughter are getting married at the Italian Villa owned by Phillip, which has been abandoned since his wife's passing. Phillip and Ida get off to a very bad start. What I liked most about the film is how well these two characters were written and acted. At first Ida comes across to Phillip as unappealing and trivial, but he begins to see her inner strength, goodness and beauty, and his icy exterior slowly melts. I was confused somewhat with Patrick, his son. The trajectory there did not seem logical to me. He is obviously conflicted but not sure how that completely explains the decisions he made. The peripheral characters provide a lot of color, drama and humor and Italy always makes for a beautiful and romantic stage.",1425081600,2,1492,4.429090909090909

Plus the preview makes it look like ""Mama Mia!"" which we thoroughly enjoyed. And there were good moments and similar moments to Mama Mia, but a lot of the plot and charcters were painted with the broadest of brushes, almost Uber-Hollywood over-the-top. The cheating husband/dad is a fat slob with no taste or self-awareness--Boo, hiss! The main heroine is extremely strong, all understanding and all-forgiving--You Go Girl! The attractive young coworker who is sleeping with the husband/dad is an insensitive, superficial, dumb, slut. Go ahead and enjoy hating her! It's pandering in the worst way. If they built on that and did it up as a melodrama, it might be interesting.
There is no chemistry between the heroine and Pierce Brosnan, the hero. The English dialogue is stilted and cliche in the worst way. I can only hope that the Danish is more lifelike and real.

5131425,4,B0084I0LLI,"So here's a Danish film with some English dialog and subtitles - apparently a deal breaker for some folks. However, I encourage you to give this one a try.  It's rare to see a movie portray people and their interactions in such a believable and unpredictable manner, rather than having the characters dancing around like puppets in service to the screen play's awkward bends and twists. You may not find any laugh out loud funny parts, but plenty of warm, family interactions and heartfelt conversations, not always pleasant. The female lead is very appealing, a cancer survivor (she hopes), estranged from her husband, who meets the widowed father of her daughter's fiance as wedding preparations are underway in Italy. There's a beautiful setting, on the Amalfi coast somewhere (I believe) and a number of interesting, well-rounded characters. The father, played by Pierce Brosnan, is initially sketched in a conventional and somewhat cliched manner, someone who withdraws into his work and away from his son after the death of his wife.. However, his awakening under the influence of the bride's mother is believable and touching.",1388361600,2,1133,5.157608695652174
5131426,4,B0084I0LLI,"Susanne Bier (In a Better World, Things We Lost in the Fire, After the Wedding, Brothers) has come up with another touching and very real exploration of human feelings with LOVE IS ALL YOU NEED co-written with Anders Thomas Jensen. In a story that could have become Hallmarky, Bier is able to score with just the right amount of human need, sentiment and reality testing that makes this little film win.

In Denmark, a hairdresser - very significant occupation we'll find - named Ida (Trine Dyrholm) has just finished post mastectomy carcinoma treatments yet when she goes home to share the news with her husband Leif (Kim Bodnia) en flagrante with a young chick form work and leaves her loutish husband to his life choices. Also living in Denmark is wealthy Englishman Phillip, a middle aged, estranged man still angry at the world for the loss of his wife, leaving him to raise his Patrick (Sebastian Jessen)? Patrick plans to marry Astrid (Molly Blixt Egelind) who happens to be the daughter of Ida. The fates of these two souls are about to intertwine as they embark for a trip to Italy to attend the wedding of Patrick and Astrid, to be staged in Philip's villa with the aid of his sister-in-law Benedikte (Paprike Steen) who has always had eyes for Philip, a thwarted romantic delusion. All eyes are on the wedding Patrick has meticulously planned but eventually takes a turn when Patrick finally admits his same sex feelings, and his thawing father falls in love with the emotionally fragile but captivating Ida. It's a story about seeking love and having the courage to change your life - even when you think it's too late.

So many threads to this story but Susanne Bier has tied them together nicely - not providing a Hollywood ending but leaving us with thoughts about how circumstances can alter the way we have been unsuccessfully viewing life. Grady Harp, December 13",1388102400,5,1881,4.766871165644171

I love this movie! It is bilingual (Danish/English) and everyone (except Brosnan) switches between the two, often during a single conversation. Even  the credits switch languages. The subtitles are fine, though, and Danish is a beautiful language.

Brosnan and costar Trine Dyrholm are wonderful together, playing heartbroken middle-agers who still want to be loved. There is a strong supporting Danish cast with well-developed characters and interesting story lines for all of them.

The story is more romance than comedy with lots of people falling in and out of love. It's heartwarming and engrossing and the Italian Riviera  location is incredibly picturesque. Highly recommended.",1383091200,22,912,5.485714285714286

5131469,4,B0084I0LLI,"Danish filmmaker Susanne Bier (""Brothers"") lighten things up a bit with this romantic comedy geared toward the AARP set (that would include me).  While the film uses up all the clichs of the genre, it has more than enough going for it for a recommendation.

One of those is Trine Dyrholm who plays Ida, an attractive middle aged Danish woman who has just completed cancer treatments and is awaiting her prognosis.  Her daughter Astrid (Molly Blixt Egelind) is in Italy preparing for a wedding to Patrick (Sebastian Jessen).  When Ida returns home unexpectedly, she finds her husband Marco (Marco D'Amore) in the sack with one of his young secretaries (Paprika Steen).

Separately Marco and Ida head for Italy for the wedding.  At the airport, Ida manages to crash her car into one driven by Philip (Pierce Brosnan) who unbeknownst to Ida is Patrick's father.  Still languishing over his wife's death years earlier, Philip is a bit of a bastard.  Both to his employees at a fruit wholesaling business and to anyone else who gets in his way.  He's aloof, stoic and likes it that way.

Once everyone arrives in Italy the various couplings begin and end as you might forecast.  Things are complicated by the fact that Philip owns the lemon-groved estate where he first met his wife 20 years earlier.  And to add to the complications, grumblings between the betrothed children may be more than typical wedding jitters.  I would also point out that the comedy portion of this alleged rom-com film is almost non-existent.  Sure Ida is a bit quirky but the humor is mostly focused on the estranged Marco bringing his sexy secretary to the affair.

What gets you hooked early on is some beautiful photography of the Italian coast.  The small town vistas are to die for and Bier and her cinematographer have an excellent eye.  This is all captured nicely in the Blu ray transfer which comes with 1080p video resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Colors are gorgeous as are skin tones.  Detail is excellent and the film has wonderful shadings as the scenes transition between day and night.  Dark blacks abound and the ocean blues are perfectly set.  The audio is excellent as well as ambient sounds are abundant.  But this is a dialog heavy film so expect a consistently placed center channel.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is in Danish and English and a little Italian with appropriate subtitles (English, French, and English SDH). Here are the extras:

5131488,2,B0084I0LLI,"Susanne Bier, the acclaimed Danish director almost never made bad films.
I have seen and liked many of her films, ""In a Better World"", ""After the Wedding"", ""Brothers"" and ""Open Heart"",
all exceptional quality films.
Trine Dyrholm is a veteran Danish actor of many quality films.
And there is Pierce Brosnan who played the romantic lead.
The background was Sorrento, Italy, during summer, in a lemon orchard, where the two leading actors' children
were getting married.
When Pierce and Trine first met, Trine's head was bald, due to chemo.
And they fell in love, to be more accurate, Pierce the long suffering widower was attracted to Trine, the still married
mother of the bride-to-be with an overweight husband not only get caught on living room sofa with his much younger
staff but brought her along to the wedding!
Then there is the annoying sister of Pierce's long deceased wife who used the occasion in an attempt to snatch Pierce.
Not to mention the groom-to-be who discovered his choice for life was his best male friend rather than the bride.
It all ended up with the respective parents of the to-be-wed couple became a twosome.
Any love story requires the viewers to feel the presence of love, the tenderness of love, the urgency of love and the longing for love.
You may find some in this film but you are not there and you don't feel it.
There is no chemistry between Trine (who looked uncomfortable in most of tender scenes) and Pierce (who tried hard to be gallant and doing his best).
This is not a good or successful romantic comedy.",1379808000,7,1548,4.715867158671586

5131501,2,B0084I0LLI,"Let me start right off the bat by saying this film has an insanely passionate kiss between two men.  And a full view of a man and woman on the couch having sex.  The man gets off of her and pulls his pants up.  She gets up nearly naked and walks away showing her rear.  Had I known about these things myself I would not have watched the movie at all.

My excitement to finally see Pierce Bronsnan in a film after all these years quickly diminished when I realized most of the film is spoken entirely in Italian!  Don't be fooled by the information listed below the film which states the film is English.  It is not.  Though the film does have English subtitles for the most part.  My gripe for this is the fact that when they showed a preview of the film recently on another movie I rented, the preview was entirely in English.  So naturally I assumed the film was an English speaking film.

The movie is slow.  It wasn't entertaining.  But the acting between Pierce and his leading lady were quite good.  However this does not make up for the long drawn out story this movie is.

Overall I can say I hated the two scenes I mentioned in the beginning, and that would warrant one star.  However, the developing story between ""Philip & Ida"" bumped it up a notch to two.  Would I see it again? No.  Would I have missed anything by not seeing it at all? No. Would I recommend it? No.",1379289600,8,1379,4.2384615384615385

The main actress who is Danish was just adorable, but her character's passiveness truly enraged me! SPOILER ALERT: When her husband dumps her for a young trollop and then immediately shows up at their son's wedding WITH that trollop, she should have punched his lights out, thrown the tart into the street, or BOTH. I couldn't believe that she just sat there and took that kind of insult/abuse. (There is a big difference between being a ""classy lady"" and just being a doormat). Anyway, Pierce Brosnan was okay in the movie...nothing outstanding about his performance.

The only subtitles there are in Italian, and they are forced (unremovable), so the entire film is visually marred. A very unpleasant, disappointing experience--why don't sellers inform us up front about these shortcomings?",1374883200,7,386,5.559322033898305
8525152,5,B0084I0LLI,"This is a delightful little love story that combines some Danish with mostly English, and is set in lovely places, with lots of beautiful people.  Self acceptance is explored through two subthemes: cancer and sexuality.  With cancer comes a loss of parts of ourselves, identity and vulnerability. With sexuality comes questions about preference of partner, parental and social expectations; and how these may inadvertently lead to hurting others and self.  Within the two themes of cancer and sexuality, acceptance is seen as being central in helping us reclaim ourselves, adjust, and find new places on which to hinge an even stronger sense of self.",1530057600,,650,5.230769230769231

I was worried about the language but it swaps to English often enough for it to flow well. Ah, such a love!",1526601600,,269,4.2745098039215685

This is a most beautiful part of Italy with breathtaking scenery at every turn.  The film is Danish, though it is spoken in English.  Its a lovely love story with Pierce Brosnan and a lovely Danish actress as the brides mother.",1520899200,,377,4.5
