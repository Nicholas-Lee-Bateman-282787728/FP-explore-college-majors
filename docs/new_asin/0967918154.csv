7794090,5,0967918154,"If you are curious about Lillian Gish this is an excellent place to start. With interviews from Lillian Gish in the late 80's and clips from many films from The Unseen Enemy to the Whales of August, the film shows ample evidence of Miss Gish being one of the greatest actresses who ever shone on a screen. Clips from hard to find films like 'The Wind' and 'The Scarlet Letter' only make one desperately want to see these films soon. If there was ever an actress who sought for truth in her work it is Lillian Gish. The only real drawback is the slightly under an hour running time and the niggling question of where the outtakes of her interview went. It would have been great just to see all of her reflections in a stand alone form. After seeing this you can look for her films on DVD and hunt down a few of the books by and about her. Lillian Gish: Passion and Truth.",1310515200,,870,4.246987951807229
7794091,4,0967918154,"The Actor's Life For Me is a short documentary about Lillian Gish and her career. Since her career spanned from the early 1900s until the 1980s when she made her last film, she is certainly a great candidate to have a film made about her. The wonderful thing about this particular one is that she is the one who tells the story. Not only does this make it more personal, but it also makes it more interesting. One can tell that Gish was sharp as a tack in her old age and could speak about her career for hours if she wanted to.

This film features many film clips not only from very old silent films (wonderfully scored by Carl Davis) but of rare footage of Griffth directing, his funeral, and Gish accepting an award in the 80s.

The only problem with this documentary is that it is short and grazes over specific films. It is mostly about the late teens and early twenties; Gish's sound career and stage career after films is only mentioned in passing. However, the fact that Miss Gish tells the story herself is reason enough to buy this documentary.",1135814400,,1054,4.427835051546392
