The other 2 movies are a very nice addition to this set.  I hadn't seen either one before, but they are very moving. HIGHLY recommend these to anyone!!",1333756800,6,303,4.375

3926082,4,B002GZJGXY,"Loved all three movies! My favorite of them all was Chasing Secrets, Della Reese is an excellent actress. I remember Deep in my Heart from Lifetime and glad I remembered some of the movie. Good price for all three movies and enjoyed them with my family! ^-^",1432166400,,257,4.48936170212766

3926084,4,B002GZJGXY,"I was disappointed when these three movies would not play in my DVD player, however I tried each movie in my portable Sony DVD player and they worked beautifully. So at least I can still watch them. Great price and good movies",1411516800,,226,4.404761904761905
3926085,5,B002GZJGXY,"All three of these movies are good. Sophia Myles is about a woman being pushed out of her home, Deep In My Heart is about a woman who puts her baby up for adoption, and Chasing Secrets, my favorite, follows the struggles in the life of a young girl and the bad treatment she receives from her poor and disfunctional birth family. Early on, she meets a neighbor couple who mentor her with proper life values that change her life forever. I had seen all three movies before, at different times, and was so happy to find them all in a set. All worth watching and all have a happy ending.",1383264000,4,584,4.27027027027027
3926086,4,B002GZJGXY,"I purchased this collection for one movie--""Deep In My Heart"".  It was beautifully done.  The story weaves an honest tale of race relations through the eyes of two women in the 60's.  What was surrendered and what was received.  The direction and casting were perfectly on point.  Lynn Whitfield and Anne Bancroft show us the art of displaying compassion, sensitivity, honor and courage through their acting and it is amazing to watch.  This movie is a winner.",1380672000,2,460,4.909090909090909

8370115,4,B002GZJGXY,"I bought this DVD strictly for ""Chasing Secrets', as I'd caught a portion of it late night on ""free"" over the air TV and just couldn't locate on Netflix or online. It is a good movie I would call it a ""Lifetime"" type movie. It's a story of a struggle and a resolving and then coming back to it years later being thankful. If you like those kind of movies this one is good. It does have Della Reese, Ossie Davis and Crystal Bernard in it and Madeline Zima (the little girl from ""The Nanny"") so not a bad cast either. It's worth a watch. I will probably watch the other movies at some point too.",1488585600,2,593,4.120689655172414
