7965259,5,B00006954N,"One great director! He wrote 17 Angry Men and other classics. I was overly satisfied and the representation to his works is just fantastic because it detailed on his personal history and Movie making. What I LOVE most about VHS is  you continue where you stop...So I recommend buying the VHS. Anyway. just great director, one of the best. Worth buying!",1456444800,,352,4.770491803278689
