I of course, already have the BRD Trilogy which is comprised of The Marriage of Maria Braun, Veronica Voss and Lola. Now I am stuck with a Region 4 set which I can't even use. I guess it's my own fault but the shipper should have been more specific and called the dvd's by their correct name",1238371200,,406,4.5
