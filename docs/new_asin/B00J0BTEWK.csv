6308111,5,B00J0BTEWK,This movie is hands down phenomenal.  The best independent film I have ever seen. It goes back to the root or horror film making and grabs you in from the very beginning.  Tyler and Renae have given me hope that great horror films can still be made.,1398384000,3,249,4.276595744680851
6308112,5,B00J0BTEWK,"They say that the only way to truly overcome your fears is to face them head on, and kick them in the ass on the way out!  So that being said, Im just going bare my soul to the horror hounds of the world and confess my fear  I don't think scary movies are scary anymore, and that terrifies me.  Dont get me wrong  I still adore the gore, love the blood and I will always approve of the gratuity of nudity, but thats just not scary.  And so I was about to give up, until I found my way into Tyler Mane's compound and I remembered, very vividly, what it was like to be scared by the silver screen again.

Compound Fracture is an independent horror/supernatural thriller that is EVERYTHING a major studio scary movie should be!  When Michael Wolffsen (Tyler Mane) returns to his childhood home, which has become a rather fortified compound, he realizes that his estranged father Gary (Muse Watson) has become more eccentric since they last saw each other 20 years ago.  Michael hopes to repair his shattered family, but their past is riddled with abuse, alcoholism, abandonment and murder. Very quickly, he, his fiancee Juliette (Renae Geerlings) and his recently adopted/orphaned nephew Brandon (Alex Saxon) realize that all is not what it seems with Gary.  The sins of the father quickly unfold to haunt not only the son, but the entire family when they realize theres something evil lurking outside the house, and soon, inside of it as well.

The film not only shows, but also showcases, Tyler Mane  the actor, not just Tyler Mane  the scary as hell, unholy terror & boogie man incarnate.  So its not just the one-dimensional hulking menace that we see in Michael, but a flawed and fallible man, trying desperately to cling to the threads of a world unraveling around him.  Helping him is co-writer, producer & lead actress, Renae Geerlings, also married to Mane in real-life.  Rather than portray the hapless, helpless, half-wit heroine, Geerlings is instead a force of a femme to be reckoned with.  She takes matters into her own hands, quite literally, to protect her family, rather than sit idly by and suffer the frightful fateful hand they're being dealt.

And now for Derek Mears, the supernatural and bloodthirsty bad guy of the film.  If you listen close enough, you can hear horror fans worldwide gasp and giggle at the chance to finally witness Jason Voorhees beating the holy hell out of Michael Myers.  However, what really packs a preternatural punch is Mears performance as William, which is made all the more sinister because he plays the monster with the human mask on  not the other way around.  And rounding out the unholy trinity of iconic silver screen killers is Muse Watson, whose portrayal of the protective, yet fatally flawed patriarch reveals a stunning emotional evolution of his character as he dances in and out of dimensions with dementia.  Oh and did I mention Leslie Easterbrook???

One of the remarkable things about this film is that it delivers a sinister combination of horror and supernatural elements, without patronising its audience by dumbing either down.  The locations are minimal (largely contained within the titular compound) but thru the combination of different cameras, camera angles and editing, it feels like a never-ending labyrinth.  The cast is comprised of a half dozen principal actors  three of whom are the most iconic terror titans in modern horror - but who we quickly see more as people instead of characters.  And there is a remarkable use of restraint  as opposed to an overdose of overindulgence  on the reliance of CGI/Special FX to distract the audience.  Instead, the film chooses to focus on telling the audience one hell of a ghost story that theyll find haunting their brain long after the film itself is done.

Overall, Compound Fracture is a film that makes your brain work, and the best part is that you don't even realize it!  It makes being frightened by a film fun again  not funny  which is a fine line that many big budget horror/supernatural movies trip over.",1398384000,7,4039,4.79739507959479
6308113,4,B00J0BTEWK,I gave this four stars because of the one main reason this movie kept the flow going. Yes I agree with another review it was slower in the beginning but what I like about that is it gave background to the movie. A base knowledge of the characters came along with the movie being a little slow moving in the beginning. Low budget equals great movie and I am not one for action packed I like scary and gross well this kept my attention. Usually I multitask with movies all the way threw this one not so much. Great job,1450137600,2,516,4.17
6308114,5,B00J0BTEWK,"Great work, Tyler. Excellent movie featuring a few of my favorite actors. The fight/attack scenes with Tyler & Derek were fantastic. Big men creating a big, scary dynamic.",1446336000,2,171,5.142857142857143
6308115,5,B00J0BTEWK,"Wow, this move's pretty awesome!

Compound Fracture is about a family (a father, his girlfriend and the father's son) who all travel to their father's home in the woods.  Turns out there's a reason high tech video cameras are scattered around the forest.  There's a ghost haunting the property, and precautionary measures need to be taken to make sure it doesn't break inside.  While I wasn't quite sure if the ghost was able to move throughout the forest or just inside and around the house, it doesn't matter.  Turns out there was a brutal killing/stabbing at the home that involved the mother and the character of Derek Mears (and the father and son).  Derek's evil ghost is haunting the property and making life absolutely miserable for the entire family.

The father, Tyler Mane, has animosity towards his father (Muse Watson) but it takes a while to find out why.  The storyline is actually really elaborate and does a tremendous job giving the viewer the family history of all the characters involved and why there's so much suspicion concerning the property, but admittedly it can be pretty confusing at times as well.  It takes a good 40-50 minutes until the actual hauntings and scares take full effect, but the story is so strong and the characters so memorable that the build-up is totally worth the wait.  I was like ""Why is Tyler so darn grumpy!""

Anyway for the longest time we're lead to think Muse is no more than a wife-beating alcoholic old man/father losing his mind, hence the reason he has a high tech camera system in his basement so he can see outside his home (because we're supposed to think he's hallucinating) but it turns out there's actual logic to his madness.  There really IS a ghost out there and he's not a friendly one either.  While Muse is clearly not the good guy since he slaps his current wife around (Leslie Easterbrook) and has a troubled history, we do eventually realize that there's something understandable taking place.  The attractive Renae Geerlings, the girlfriend of Tyler Mane, makes it clear that she really loves and cares for her husband in case it appeared like she was only hanging around for the money (and let's be honest, it *did* appear that way).

Eventually after 45 minutes or so, the ghost of Derek Mears appears and causes nothing but blood squirting, face ripping, arm breaking havoc around the house for everybody.  Without spoiling too much, the movie does eventually get to the point that it's basically ghosts and humans teaming up to battle evil wife-killing Derek and can feel like a crazy mess by this point, but everything from a storyline perspective makes sense, and there's enough tension concerning where Derek's ghost is going to appear next and who he's going to target that the movie is ultimately really good by the end.

Other than the horrible first 5 minutes that makes Compound Fracture look like a low budget horror movie with forgettable characters, the rest of the movie turns out to be quite splendid and delightful.  Highly recommended.",1440374400,4,3029,4.814671814671815

6308118,5,B00J0BTEWK,"Compound Fracture is what Id imagine would happen if Rob Zombies Halloween and the Supernatural TV series had a movie baby. It has tons of horror movie star power and is quite efficient at using its low budget to make a film that rivals the big boys. It starts off slow for about the first 20 minutes to give weight and legitimacy to the story and its characters before leaping head-first into the action and suspense which is generously served up for the duration of the movie. You really start to care about each of the characters, which is rare for most horror films. The writing and directing are solid and I really enjoyed how the subdued color palette gave the story an even creepier vibe. The bulk of the film takes place in one location, but each scene is laid out in such a way that you barely notice that theyve never left the compound. It was very reminiscent of movies like Saw and Youre Next. Overall, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has enjoyed any of these actors other work and want a refreshing change of pace from the typical haunted house stories that are out there already. I guarantee you won't be disappointed.",1430870400,4,1144,4.5048076923076925

6308124,4,B00J0BTEWK,"Compound Fracture is a real gem of independent entertainment. I really liked this film for a variety of reasons. First, the cast - Tyler Mane (Michael Myers, Halloween I & II), Derek Mears (Jason Voorhees, Friday the 13th), Muse Watson (Ben Watson aka The Fisherman, I Know What You Did Last Summer), and Leslie Easterbrook (Mama Firefly, The Devil's Rejects and Callahan from the Police Academy series) - all knocked it out of the park. I was even pleasantly surprised by the actors/actresses I was not familiar with. Renae Geerlings (who happens to be quite the looker...good job, Tyler!) and Alex Saxon were excellent, as well. Second, the story is great. Not your normal run- of-the-mill horror script that's been done a hundred times. It actually made me want to do some research into the occult themes/rituals and Viking history displayed in the movie...very cool! Lastly, the pace of the film is set just right. I did not feel myself getting bored at all and I felt the right amount of tension that comes with a good slow-burn thriller. Overall, Compound Fracture is a really good movie and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good time. Definitely not a time- waster!",1414800000,4,1184,4.8088235294117645

6308130,3,B00J0BTEWK,"There are some who may know the name Tyler Mane. If not then my guess is you've seen him without realizing it. At one time a professional wrestler, Mane made his big break in films playing Sabretooth in the first X-MEN movie. That led to his getting parts in numerous horror and action films over the past 14 years as well as tons of appearances at conventions across the country. Now he steps into as one of the writers and producers of COMPOUND FRACTURE.

Mane stars as Michael, a no nonsense father on his way to visit his ailing father Gary (Muse Watson). Along for the ride are Michael's girlfriend Juliette (Renae Geerlings) and his nephew Brandon, a stereotypical brooding teen. It's been years since Michael has been home and the resentment he feels for his father is palpable. But with the death of his sister earlier and a call from his stepmother he decides the time is right to come home and try to make amends.

When they arrive at his father's house the first thing they notice is the overabundance of security cameras covering the house. When Gary comes out to greet them he seems to keep a wary eye out and later acts a bit strange. Annabelle (Leslie Easterbrook), Gary's wife, has reached a point where his violent nature has taken its toll on her. She still loves him but can't deal with him any longer. She relates this to Michael, apologizing for leaving, but hoping for the best.

As the story progresses we learn that things are not exactly what they seem. Isn't it always that way? Just what happened to Chloe and how she was killed is the centerpiece of the story. A combination of ghost story and cult-like activity join together to make an interesting tale. It seems Chloe's husband and Brandon's father William was heavily involved in the occult, enough so that when he died his ghost lived on and has come to seek retribution and spill evil over the family he left behind. Just who will survive this battle makes for a great story.

William is played here by Derek Mears, another horror film regular these days who makes the convention circuit as well. Mears has a menacing appearance when he wants and uses it to full advantage here. One of the few actors able to stand eye to eye with Mane, the face off between these two as they battle for the lives of Mane's loved ones makes for an interesting confrontation.

For me, while the entire cast did a great job, the stand out was Mane. With his angry appearance and bad guy wrestler build Mane has been subjected to always playing the heavy in most films he's made. He even played the new Michael Meyers for goodness sake. Here he is given the chance to show that he does indeed have some acting ability and can play the good guy if given the chance. He does a great job of it but at the same time come on Tyler, smile a little more.

In the end what we have here is an enjoyable horror film that offers an original story with some great acting to take you on the trip it offers. It's rare that a horror film offers something new these days. Take advantage of the trip this one presents and you just might have a good time.",1405382400,2,3101,4.431578947368421
6308131,5,B00J0BTEWK,"I am not a fan of horror films....but I love being ""scared silly"".....so that does not leave me many films....some good books, but not many films. Most movies are either sophomoric and not really scary or so gory and silly, they are just teen age stuff.  Compound Fracture was completely different!

The actors were solid, I especially loved Annabelle, what an extraordinary actress - she played her part with style and ease.  Evil guy scared the britches off of m and the gore throughout was more than adequate.  Creative script, in my opinion.  Great job all the way around.  The kid reminded me of Billiy Joe of Green Day, really.  Don't pass on this movie; it's definitely 5 star material.",1401321600,2,555,4.708333333333333
6308136,4,B00J0BTEWK,"This one really surprised me. Its free on prime but I wouldn't have minded paying for it. I wish more of the lo budget, indie flicks were like this one. Kinda like Dark House in a way, in its novel approach, though the latter departs even more from ""reality"". You need to like suspending disbelief for this one. The characters seem genuine and feels like you are peeping in on someone's life, though an unusual one for sure. The estranged son returns home to visit his eccentric father who was heavily into nordic legend and occult lore. His house is like a fortress against some evil force that we don't know about yet. He also happens to be having brief episodes of early dementia, which casts doubt on what is really going on, The action happens quickly and it is interspersed with flashbacks that explain the set up. These choices help keep the pace moving along propery. The production values are fine- no soap opera like camera work. Its not one of those, though some of those have entertained me, just not enough of them to avoid me becoming suspicious when I see  that is what I'm getting. I re. commend this one highly if you are into supernatural tales,with a slasher like feel to it. There's violence and the death scenes are good. Again, if you need everything to correspond to the known laws of physics,you might not like it. But then again, you probably wouldn't be into supernatural themes anyway.",1400889600,11,1412,4.603174603174603

6308140,2,B00J0BTEWK,"Hairy necked Viking Michael ""Don't Call Me Junior"" Wolffsen (Tyler Mane) returns home after being away for twenty years to his father Garrison (Muse Watson) who has dementia. He sees things on bad days and on good days too. Michael is with his fiancee Juliette (Renae Geerlings) and moody teen nephew Brandon ( Alex Saxon) who uses his own eye liner. Taking care of Garrison is his second wife Annabelle (Leslie Easterbrook) who he often mistakes for his first wife.

There appears to be some haunting along with some gruesome flashbacks to a murder explained about half way through the film. Garrison is compulsive about security in his isolated compound/home and has a ""safe room"" decorated like the set designer has a necronomicon. As we try to figure out what is going on, it becomes worse when we find out...rather a let down.

Our writers didn't stick to what works: Cursed Indian burial ground, woman rolling around on the ceiling, and a shower scene. This is especially true when the acting is borderline, the dialogue sucks, the plot boring, and the entity sub-par. Nice attempt at originality, but the film seemed so uneven.

6308153,5,B00J0BTEWK,"Compound Fracture is a new independent horror/thriller that is a first time project for Mane Entertainment. This movie is engaging and smart from beginning to end. With a suspenseful story that will keep you enthralled and will grab your attention and not let go on many levels. First time screen play writer Renae Geerlings gets a standing golf clap for her efforts with this creative and well spun ghost tale. There is no substitute for a good story. This talented formed editor and chief at Pro-Con comics branches out into that creative and ever so difficult first time screen play. Renae delivers big with her ability to create merging multiple story lines and a well thought out script that gives haunting performances from a delightful cast of actors. When 3 big name iconic serial killer actors join forces to work in a independent film... there has to be a reason! A great story and script always attracts talent. Renae delivers the story and the actors really deliver with great chemistry and performances. This haunting ghost story delivers with powerful performances from Muse Watson and cast. Tyler Mane and Derek Mears shows some some great action scenes but with some impressive acting prowess. Who knew these guys could be more than physical actors behind iconic masks. Tyler Mane and Mane Entertainment have demonstrated real staying power in the Horror/Thriller genre with this first time effort. But after seeing this compound mixture of great story, great performances and terrific suspense...we now are left with ...dare I say...wanting to see more and more.

Performances are uneven and the script isn't the most solid, but it's a clever idea.",1476403200,2,179,6.5

8646985,5,B00J0BTEWK,"Entertaining and surprisingly well done.  I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but I really liked it.  Tyler Mane (Michael Myers- Rob Zombie's Halloween 1-2), Derek Mears (Jason- Friday the 13th reboot), and Muse Watson (Ben- I Know What You Did Last Summer) are in the movie.  Tyler Mane plays Michael Wolffsen, who's father Gary, (Muse Watson) is obsessed with thinking his house is haunted by an evil spirit (Derek Mears).  Gary has since built his home into a heavily monitored place to make sure the spirit can't get in.  Michael's wife and son are stuck there and deal with the problem too.  At the end, the spirit is able to break in and Michael fights with it in some really good fight sequences.  Gary dies, stops the spirit, and Michael and his family leave the compound.

I like Compound Fracture because it's different than most horror movies I've seen.  I've seen a few paranormal and supernatural movies, but this one is better than most of them.  For special features, there's a commentary by Tyler Mane and Renae Geerlings (Michael's wife in the movie), out-takes, and a behind-the-scenes photo gallery.  I like all these features.

If you have not seen Compound Fracture, I recommend seeing it.  It's an entertaining and well-directed psychological/paranormal thriller and one of my favorites.",1465516800,2,1314,4.972477064220183
8646986,5,B00J0BTEWK,"Absolutely love this movie! I'm a huge fan of Derek Mears' and Tyler Mane's work, so seeing them together in this film was pure awesome. The story itself is also interesting and had a nice twist at the end. After watching this movie for the first time, I loved it so much that I watched it 3 more times within the following two days! Highly recommend this movie!",1462060800,2,362,4.338235294117647
