8181825,1,B000NVIXLO,"The making of the movie is not good, and non-sense, very low quality, technical, graphic and everything are not good.  The sound is bad, picture is bad",1394236800,3,151,4.592592592592593
8181826,4,B000NVIXLO,"If three and a half stars was allowed, that's likely what I would have gone with here...

You've got a bartender who is sharing his wild tales of lurid women (or is it lurid tales of wild women?). That part doesn't amount to much. Then you've got five women who are the subjects of the stories. The women aren't Peach A-listers and aren't particularly attractive, except for  Ashley Roberts who is hands-down the hottest here yet the least-utilized. The vignettes tend to be too long and repetitive and most are shot in moody darkness. Boo. But there is some very graphic nudity in some scenes and that kept me hovering between three stars and four.

Why I gave it four in the end was because of the full hour of interviews done with the girls in the bonus area. A great addition that you pretty much never see in releases like this. The women seemed so much more appealing after watching their interviews. However, Peach even screwed that up on this one because I had to set my volume at maximum (seriously, at 100 on the indicator) just to be able to hear the audio.

So, overall, a middling release that feels uneven, at times even dull, yet has some really shiny spots.",1379203200,,1173,4.492957746478873

8181828,4,B000NVIXLO,"I had to have this DVD when I saw the box and the cast at Amazon. Celeste Star (at left on the box) is a sexy girl in several Peach DVDs I own, so I wanted to see more of her. The girl on the right is sexy too. I forget her name for the moment. Oh it's Lisa A. Daniels, and she's in several Peach DVDs I own too. I prefer brunettes usually, so I didn't notice the girl in the center so much. Celeste and Lisa have damned sexy scenes in this DVD, but they have even hotter ones in other DVDs. I thus rate this DVD 4 stars and their best ones 5 stars, since I can't give them 6 stars.",1315872000,2,582,3.7016129032258065
