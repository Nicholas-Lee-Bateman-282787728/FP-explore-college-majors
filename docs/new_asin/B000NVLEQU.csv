8467589,5,B000NVLEQU,"What a wonderful and warm movie! Understated, passionate, and disarmingly humourous.  Eden, even with English subtitles, does not slip in its pacing and movement. My teenage children and grandparents loved it.  It doesn't get any more inter-generational than this. The use of ""food"" as the backdrop and catalyst for character and plot changes was brilliant.  Indeed, no character is left untouched and unchanged by the remarkable cuisine of our protagonist (not even the dog).  I know the movie ""Big Night"" is often touted as THE food movie. But, truth be told, Eden leaves the Big Night in the dark.",1265500800,2,600,5.03030303030303
