7732860,2,B01E7XTYPM,"Definitely not the best season of this show.  I was a huge fan of the early seasons and was super excited at the end of the fourth season to aee l, *spoiler*, Fitz and Olivia get together. But after four years of waiting for this moment, it all goes to pieces.  Its Scandal, so you know it's not going to be happy ever after, but the this great love devolves into a relationship ago controlling that it borders on abuse before quickly ending. The other great thing about season for was the end of Rowan and his organization and what do they do in the second half of the season? They bring back Rowan.  Season 5 seems to be all about destroying everything that was built up over the first 4 years- the Fitz/Olivia love story, the OPA family, the morality of David Rosen, and the strength of Olivia who is now a violent crazy puppet of her father.  This season was kind of a dud, but I'll give it a few extra stars for being a spectacular one. I will tune in next fall for a little bit to give shonda a chance to prove she knows where she is going with this mess, but I think this show is on its last legs.",1463443200,34,1104,4.120930232558139
7732861,1,B01E7XTYPM,"How the mighty have fallen.  From a compelling, fascinating, can't-miss-an-episode series in its first and second seasons, Scandal's fifth season devolved into an unwatchable train wreck with its main character transformed from a smart, capable, competent, resourceful character into a person who is so unlikable, so unrelatable, so unpleasant and so unsympathetic that you no longer care what happens to her.  She could get run over by a truck and I'd say good riddance.  The series has actually become that bad.

The reason, of course, is that the showrunner, Shonda Rhimes, is evidently writing for an audience of one.  This is her show and the viewers be damned.  Never mind that she has trashed her main characters and run the show completely off track.  What she doesn't seem to realize is that there an enormous difference between not acquiescing to all the demands of her fans, and deliberately spiting those same fans.  Example: millions of fans expressed that they were tired of Rowan and wanted him gone from the show.  So what is her response?  She not only keeps him on the show, she promotes him to a series regular.  (I don't think it was a coincidence that immediately after the promotion was announced, the show lost another million viewers.). Throughout this season Ms. Rhimes has expressed her complete contempt for her audience, tweeting several times that ""if you don't like the show then don't watch it.""  Millions of viewers have taken her at her word; the ratings have been in a steep decline.

Another major problem with series is the gaping plot holes big enough to fly a jumbo jet through.  The writers seem to think the audience can't remember what happens from one episode to the next.  Plot lines get left dangling in midair.  Nothing gets resolved.  The series makes about as much sense now as a jigsaw puzzle with half the pieces missing.  One gets the sense that Shonda is floundering around aimlessly and throwing whatever she can get her hands on at the wall hoping something will stick.  All you can do is give up in disgust.

In the end, Shonda Rhimes comes off as an arrogant individual whose success has gone to her head.  She thinks she is untouchable.  She appears to be completely unable to accept any kind f constructive criticism.  Her reaction to the discontent around this season of ""Scandal"" is like a four year old stamping her feet and screaming, no, no, no, it's MY show and I'll run it any way I want!

Well good luck with that, Shonda.  This is your show and you're going to run it your way, never mind if you wreck the show in the process.  But I am jumping off this sinking ship before it sinks for good.  What a waste.  ""Scandal"" had so much promise and potential, and now it's a banal, boring mess.  R.I.P.

7732866,1,B01E7XTYPM,"I bought Seasons 1-5 from Amazon and watched every single episode because I am a masochist.
With no exceptions, the acting is impeccable and I shed buckets of tears at this waste of talent on a story which sacrifices verisimilitude and good taste at the altar of fashionable delusions.
First, that the United States government is under the thumb of a coven of secretive assassins.  Second, that men and women in high positions are helpless victims of their libido. Third, that both the good guys and the bad guys can be everywhere at the same time.  I could go on but choose to restrain myself.
I am not buying Season 6 because masochism has its limits.",1501545600,,653,4.620689655172414

I was really enjoying Season 5 of Scandal but was very disappointed when it came to the two final disks.  For some reason they would not load in my player.  I know it is not my player causing the issue because I have been able to watch my other recent purchase; Quantico Season 1 without any problems.  What do I need to do to get it replaced?  I'd really like to see the final episodes of Season 5.

7732903,1,B01E7XTYPM,"Season 5 took a  turn for the worst. Kerry Washington isn't into this movie as she first was. it's becoming a joke. Don't know if hubby  is the one who is calling the shots, she is not on top anymore. To be honest this show can survive without her.  While she  and have more babies to Keep her husband who do not want to be with her. The oldest trick in the world  having a baby or babies to hold on .  I can remember some episodes she had bruises around her neck a black eye they were trying to cover with makeup. if this guy her husband is this violent with her, why did she marry or have children with him unbelievable! I hate the show.  It was great 1-3 after that it went downhill.  Then she states she do not like the kissing scenes, well to me she was enjoying it until muku muku came into the picture, Her so call husband.. The way I see this she ruined her career  . Hopefully, the writers will get creative and write less scenes for her.  She should just take off a YEAR and a HALF face what is coming No marriage deal with becoming a  single mother  she can afford it...  drama on the set and drama at home cannot be fun.",1473984000,,1132,4.022421524663677

7732908,1,B01E7XTYPM,"I loved Scandal seasons 1-4 like no other show. Oh, there were ups & downs as with any show you like, but I loved Scandal. Seasons 1-2 are favorites; some day I hope to enjoy them again. 3-4 had a few great moments & I admit, with the way 4 ended, I could not wait for season 5. That certainly did not go as expected. Episodes 1-8 have good moments, a couple that are favorites of mine. Episode 9 changed EVERYTHING.  No tv episode has disappointed me as much as that one. In that 43 minutes it was made clear to me what Shonda Rhimes has said: Scandal is her show & her story. ABC seems fine with that even though they lost millions of viewers. Tony Goldwyn & Kerry Washington, (I love them!) have a chemistry like no other on tv. But sometimes they don't even seem to be the leads of Scandal & that's a huge waste. My advice, watch seasons 1-2!",1471910400,12,846,4.158536585365853

7732910,2,B01E7XTYPM,"Two months now since the end of season five, and tonight saw re-runs of season four's 'The Lawn Chair' and 'The Testimony of Diego Munez' (sorry if spelling's wrong). Both were episodes that touched, with exceptional thoughtfulness and insight, on some very difficult issues (cop's shooting of a black kid in the 1st ep., and in the second, Liv's post-kidnapping PTSD, DM's reluctance to testify and why, and a dignified old lady searching for her lost more-than-friend.) Why mention two eps from the prior season? Because, when Scandal's good, it's REALLY good. Like, award-winning, best-drama-on-TV good... But then, sadly, we have Season Five.
Season Five felt like being on the business end of a YO-YO (seriously!). There were a few really good episodes, but not enough; some train-wreck episodes that were a general mess; and a couple of real bombs, with one in particular (the winter finale) that was unbelievably repugnant. If this was SR's Year of Yes, then no wonder that so many fans said 'No'. 2 1/2 (exasperated) stars.",1466985600,13,1031,5.035087719298246
