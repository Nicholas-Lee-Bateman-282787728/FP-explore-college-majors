8221129,5,B000ER1K0I,Easily my favourite Australian movie. If you want to see the Australian outback captured in all its glory with the typical dry Aussie wit this is such good viewing. A superb cast executes this story perfectly. Every time I watch this it feels like i am returning home. This would be Jack Thompsons best performance as he spent time as a youth shearing sheep he fits the rol as Foley the gun shearer. A must for any Australian movie fan.,1203724800,7,436,4.4625
