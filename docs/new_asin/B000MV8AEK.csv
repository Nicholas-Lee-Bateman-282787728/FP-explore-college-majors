2749946,2,B000MV8AEK,"I have been a huge Rancid fan for years, and I was thrilled to see that they were releasing this dvd. It sounded nice to have all of their old videos in one place along with some new ones that I hadn't seen. Boy was I in for a surprise. Half of these so called ""music videos"" are nothing more than black and white jumbles of concert footage and the like. I don't think that counts as a music video, but maybe I am too nitpicky. I understand the grainy black and white motif- I actually found it novel with the videos for the Tim Armstrong solo stuff. But when it's been done 10 times already I don't want to see it ten more times. I'll always like Rancid but I wouldn't recommend this dvd. Download the good videos off of Youtube and forget about the rest. Overall, a waste of money.",1255651200,3,783,4.157894736842105
2749947,5,B000MV8AEK,"This movie has everything!! Very well acted (no crappy actors here), great story, keeps you guessing, good plot, very original, great directing, this movie rates a 10 in my book. This is not a horror flick but a fantastic thriller/mystery. The movie flowed & kept my interest all the way. If you like mystery thrillers then this is the flick 2 pick. Fantastic!!

2749948,2,B000MV8AEK,"Very disappointing. For starters, for this release, the video for ""Let Me Go,"" which was on the Punk-O-Rama DVD, is obviously recorded off a TV. They simply pointed a camcorder at a TV screen to capture it for this release. You can clearly see the TV lines. Also, ""Fall Back Down"" is edited to be the ""punk rock"" high contrast black and white style of Tim Armstrong's solo record videos. Almost all the ""new"" videos are in that style as well. ""Who Would've Thought"" is interesting in that the brief shot of the clap board in the beginning of the video suggests it was directed by the amazing Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, yet the video is terrible (and looks to be unfinished given the blue screen in the background with nothing inserted into it). All in all, this is a very underwhelming release due to the videos not being given high quality transfers or being given unwelcome makeovers. You're not getting the complete original Rancid videos with this release.",1216166400,8,968,4.7
2749949,5,B000MV8AEK,"NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE, I WAS LOOKING FOR MONSTERS AND ROTTEN FLESH!  THIS MOVIE HAD ME ON THE EDGE OF MY BEAN BAG FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.  IT'S ONE OF THOSE WHERE YOU GO - ""WHAT???.""  THIS MOVIE IS DEAD SERIOUS BUT THE ENDING MADE ME CHUCKLE.

8172599,5,B000MV8AEK,I love that this has the videos that it does. The only thing is I thought that there should be more as I'm pretty sure that more were made in the time frame. I still love it either way though.,1475452800,,192,3.825
8172600,5,B000MV8AEK,Great footage! Old to new! Get to share it with my youngster,1473984000,,60,4.083333333333333
8172601,3,B000MV8AEK,"Despite the unfortunate title and cover, ""Rancid"" is anything but rancid. It is actually a solid mystery/thriller that is generally riveting. There are some minor plot holes and it tries to be a little too clever at times, but otherwise this is a surprisingly fine effort.",1358640000,,272,4.934782608695652
8172602,5,B000MV8AEK,"I you are a die-hard Rancid fan you will love this. Yeah several videos are in the black and white aspect, but the rest are absolutely amazing. Red Hot Moon has to be one of the best music videos of all time!",1358553600,,208,3.9761904761904763
8172603,4,B000MV8AEK,"This is a great film. It is entertaining, suspenseful, and effectively produced. I didn't like the female lead, but then again, this isn't ultimately a problem. I kept this on my ""watchlist"" for a long time. It was recommended by Amazon based on my viewing history. Honestly, the cover picture turned me off. It like just another female slasher victim movie. This is not the case. I think you will like it.",1353801600,,406,4.652777777777778
8172604,4,B000MV8AEK,"Rancid (2004) is an intriguing tale of suspense that immediately draws you into a dense web of passion, deception, and murder, that centers on a group of former college classmates in New York.  Directed by Jack Ersgard, with the support of the Swedish Film Institute, much of the film was actually shot on location in Sweden.

A rather basic story is made much more interesting, by time shifting so that the plot is revealed in a series of flashbacks, spliced with events in the present.  This is not an usual approach, but it works very well here, as the film opens with James Hayson (Matthew Settle) in a house where someone has been murdered, trying to evade detection by the police.  Hayson is discovered, but manages to get out of the house and make a desperate escape into the night.

Previous to these events, Hayson, a struggling writer facing financial crisis, attended a class reunion held at the home of Crispin Klein (Currie Graham), a rich and successful ex-classmate.  Hayson is accompanied by his classmate Angela (Siena Goines), and runs into Andy Fell (Patrik Ersgard), another classmate who is now a New York City police detective.  Hayson's one time girlfriend Monica (Fay Masterson) is married to Klein, but she rekindles a relationship with Hayson, which soon finds the writer in Klein's bedroom while he is away.

Klein is a jealous man with things to hide.  He routinely strikes his wife, and employs hired muscle to get things done.  After Monica receives a severe beating, Hayson finds himself in Klein's house armed with a kitchen knife, bent on committing homicide.  Things however, do not go as planned, and Hayson unexpectedly finds himself a fugitive wanted for a murder he did not commit.  He turns to Angela and Detective Fell for help, putting them at risk, as the police investigation closes in.

With a number of twists and lots of deceit and misdirection, Rancid is a dark intriguing journey where exactly what has happened is kept hidden for as long as possible.  The flashback plot structure helps facilitate this, and probably improves the impact of the film, which contains several major surprises and some sudden deaths.  The film has good production values, with interior sets that pass for a dark and dreary looking New York, and the acting is very solid.  If passion based crime dramas interest you, this one might prove to be an interesting find.",1300320000,3,2391,4.866666666666666
8172605,1,B000MV8AEK,"Well... Either the reviewers on here are all being very sarcastic or they are true morons. This was the worst piece of garbage I've ever seen. I turned it off after 40 minutes. The two cops look and act like cartoon characters, and the writing is beyond amateurish. And seeing a perfectly clean butcher knife laying in a big puddle of blood in the first 2 minutes (supposedly the murder weapon), I knew it was made by an idiot. They couldn't even put like, I don't know, a little smear of blood on it? Or a few drops or something to make it realistic? Unbelievable to me.",1286150400,2,571,4.345794392523365
8172606,4,B000MV8AEK,This movie kept you guessing all the way till the end. None of the characters are really what they seem. It is worth renting.,1261440000,2,125,4.25
8172607,3,B000MV8AEK,"This movie surprised me.  It is much better than I thought it would be. I give it three stars because there are flaws in it's plot line and it could benefit from having one or the other scene edited out, but that having been said, it remains surprisingly good. It has enough twists to keep the viewer's interest and the actors are good enough to make a viewer care about their characters. It's worth the purchase price. The directing for the most part is sharp - as is the cinematography. If you're in the mood for a good little ""cop movie"", you could do far worse than this one.",1258156800,,579,4.3119266055045875
