8660350,1,B000XSDHRC,"I couldn't expect much better from the Toscanini film; it being a poor copy of a kinescope from early television.  But the real disappointmen came when watching The Titan - Which is why I bought the disk.  It is a splicey copy of a scratched 16mm print, and is hardly worthy of an Academy Award winning Documentary.  I guess I will have to search further for a decent copy of this amazingly powerful film.",1425254400,,405,4.445945945945946
