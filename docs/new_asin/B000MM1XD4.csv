8169999,5,B000MM1XD4,"One of the zaniest tongue in cheek yet eerily creepy movies I've ever seen; unlike say Rocky Horror - it's not as campy but you will find it hard to feel bad for anyone in it! So enchanting that just to find it, don't care if it's not available in DVD form, and jumped on buying it.  It's almost like you're witnessing and are in some devilish inside joke - Oliver Reed is genius in this - don't think for one second that anyone in this odd spoof of a B movie is not aware of it but at the same time everyone delivers - espeically Reed; the beautiful Reed is the ugly character - it's not the most original of twists but it works beautifully in this movie - you are absolutely captived and horrified by Reed's change... and the last scene will make you laugh out loud - the first time I saw it, it caught me by surprise - both the ending and my howl. Visually - you can easily imagine this movie as a cartoon, CGI  or even a picture novel... either it was way ahead of itself or the director had a wonderful vision  - what makes this movie work is it's the 70's, it's tongue in cheek and no question, Oliver Reed (may he RIP).",1437523200,,1126,4.085972850678733
8170000,3,B000MM1XD4,Campy to the nth degree.  A lark for those who like over-the-top and under-the-radar movies.  Prepare to be pummeled with obvious moral factors.,1351987200,,144,5.217391304347826

A sweet but deformed-on-the-outside podiatrist,Dr. Heckyl, takes a potion from a mad scientist that makes him into the handsome guy he has always wanted to be.  The handsome version, Mr. Hype, is a scalawag. Oliver Reed and a fine supporting cast make this movie.  I only wish that they would release it on DVD.",1318032000,,364,4.569230769230769
