8414606,5,B0043CJJO4,"Imagine an alternate universe where anything is not only possible, but probably funny too.  The first I ever saw of this series was of a man going on the tarmac at the airportand walking towards a tangle of aircraft.  I had expected to see some mild comical misdirection.  What I saw (and won't spoil) was wonderfully, whimsically funny.  This collection of sketch comedy is like nothing I ever imagined.  Warning:  This is not a Region 1 DVD!  While I have a region free player and am able to watch this DVD I think that BBC America should release it over here.",1292371200,,562,4.5049504950495045
