4075544,5,B0036BDQ60,"I brought this and part 2 from another site. This copy ,however, seems to have more extras. It is my most favourite series. The DVD anime transfers all the wit,drame and comedy from the much loved manga series .The characters are loveable,flawed and easy to relate to. If it is ever transfered into spoken English ,I will buy it again .A word of warning ,it is Yaoi .",1275004800,,367,4.411764705882353
4075545,5,B0036BDQ60,"I was so happy to get my DVDs the other day and started watching it right away.  I love this anime and any yaoi fan will definitely enjoy these DVDs.  I do prefer the manga more,but the anime is worth watching.  I can't wait until Season 2 is available to purchase.

Junjou Romantica is a love story that includes three couples:  Misaki X Usagi, Hiroki X Nowaki, and Shinobu X Miyagi.  My favorite couple is Shinobu X Miyagi even though they were not in the first season that much.  All of the couples are very cute and the stories show how they struggle to make their relationships work.  If you love romance with ""boys"", you'll love Junjou Romantica!",1273622400,,652,4.466101694915254
4075546,5,B0036BDQ60,"Misaki is suddenly having some unexpected and odd problems. What started as a need for some college entrance exam tutoring has somehow led him to being romanced by a suave older man who also happens to be his big brother's best friend. Confused by all of his brand new emotions, Misaki struggles to deal with his suddenly very odd life. And if that wasn't enough, his suitor, Usami, has plenty of issues of his own. A man-child who decorates his room in giant teddy bears and toys, Usami is a famous novelist who also writes steamy boys' love novels on the side. When Misaki cracks open one of these books and reads sentences like ""Misaki licks every inch of Usami's hot body""...well, let's just say that all hell breaks loose. And if one couple isn't enough for you, Junjo Romantica focuses on three different sets of lovers, each with their own compelling stories.
Junjou, Romantica is my favorite BL, series, since becoming a yaoi fan. This series is innocent,fresh new ideas and of course ROMANTIC. This dvd set comes with the first 12 episodes of Season 1, a booklet that comes with the back ground history of the characters and special items from selected episodes, it has bonus's on each disk and if you are a true yaoi girl you will love that the shadow during the sex scences is erased, showing us fans just a bit more skin, then if you have watched it online :). I have noticed that some of the translating is different but then i realised it made a lot more sense to me, since it was regular english, not translated english but i do know translated english word for word in the series, so it will take some time to get used too. Other than that cant wait for Season2 and this boxset is a must, for any Yaoi Girl. xoxo",1273622400,14,1728,4.454258675078864
4075547,5,B0036BDQ60,"This is one of my favorite BL titles. It has everything. Good story, good character development, and great love scenes. I have to admit I like the manga much more, though.

I just yesterday finished rewatching this series after I got the DVDs for it and it was as great as the first time. Well, it was even better now that I could watch the whole thing at once without waiting for weeks for the next episode to come out.

The three couples are awesome. My favorites would be Nowaki x Hiroki and Miyagi x Shinobu. I guess I am one of the few who didn't like Usagi and Misaki the most. The three couples are adorable, though. Their relationships have its ups and downs but they manage to draw you in.

Can't wait for Jyunjyo Romantica 2 to come out to DVD.",1273363200,4,754,4.258741258741258
4075548,5,B0036BDQ60,"Back:
Based on the best-selling manga! Three very different couples caught up in a storm of pure romance!
Romantica: Misaki is struggling to prepare for his college entrance exams, so his brother arranges for a private tutor. But Misaki's nightmare is just beginning when his tutor, Usami, comes on to him!
Egotist: Just when kamijou's life is at its lowest, he has a chance meeting with a man who never lets anything hold him back: Nowaki. His name means ""typhoon,"" and he's about to take Kamijou on a whirlwind ride that will turn everything upside-down.
Terrorist: Miyagi always seem to shrug off the cares of the world with a joke and a smile. But even he has problems, although he doesn't let them show. Foremost is Shinobu, a relentless young man who's adamant that they're destined to be together.

My Review:
Junjo Romantica is a yaoi (boys love) anime. I was impressed that the anime actually follows the Junjo Romantica manga by Shungiku Nakamura very well (in case the fans of the manga were wondering).
This collection has three discs with four episodes per disc. Unfortunantly for dub fans this collection is Japanese language only with English subtitles. It also comes with a little booklet that outlines how the characters are drawn, the buildings are laid out, and some featured items from the episodes. There are also special features on each of the three discs; US trailer, Nozomi trailers, tv spots and commercials, cleam opening and closing songs, and liner notes. The box that holds all this is sturdy (I dislike the flimsy boxes other anime have been coming out in lately).
Overall I am very pleased with my purchase and will wait eagerly for the next season!

Misaki always loves to run away from Akihiko but he really wants him. and Akihiko is so narcissisitic but in a good way. he really cares for his friends and loves Misaki. and their love scenes are great. funny and sexy at the same time. they are not explicit but u get the idea.
my other favorites are Hiroki and Nowaki. Hiroki is so afraid of showing his feelings and loving anyone. plus he's so focused on his career, but Nowaki made him see that he needs love and can accept it. I just love Nowaki. he won't give up on Hiroki. and they never seem to communicate correctly with each other. they are always misunderstanding each others feelings. especially Hiroki. it just too cute.

The intimate moments are more tastefully done and aren't focused on very much even though they are still there though. Seeing the characters come to life is so cute and fun and gets your heart racing. Such a cute story. Great Manga series. Great Anime series. I just bought season 2 so Im excited to start that.

It came with three DVD cases and a 24 page character booklet, which is different from the Season 2 one.

4075593,4,B0036BDQ60,"Animes like these make me wish that there were better quality anime in terms of realism. In reality, I think Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi is way better than Romantica but this review isn't about talking about that.

Season 1 is the beginning introducing the three main couples Romantica, Egoist and Terrorist. Each pairing has their own struggles that makes you route for them but...I still have issues with each pairing...mainly the stereotypes that come with the anime.

Romantica: The main pairing you're supposed to love. Reading the manga, this pairing gets boring REALLY fast and its a shame because there's a lot of potential. The first episode is off to a rough stuff with Usagi raping Misaki (the anime tones this down but sheesh, people wonder why yaoi fangirls are labeled as insane when the main pairing is the one that starts with rape). The entire plot is recycled over and over again to the point of it getting boring. Either Misaki gets jealous of one of Usagi's friends or Usagi gets insanely jealous of the people that hang out with Misaki and keeps showing possessive qualities that would make me want to compare him to Edward Cullen. The only difference is as the season goes on, Misaki DOES grow a backbone and can yell at Usagi (its still not that effective but still). The few episodes that break the jealousy trend (which is a recurring theme for all of the pairings but it doesn't overshadow them like this one) are the rare ones that I really like. Overall, I just find Misaki annoying when he can't even say ""I love you"" to Usagi and I get mad at Usagi for making me want to compare him to Edward Cullen of all people. Alas, this is only season 1 with these episodes so it gets better anyway.

Egoist: The pairing that everyone ends up loving the most mainly because there is no rape involved and while the feelings are mutual and sex is consensual, the way the relationship is handled dips into domestic abuse at times on Hiroki's end. Now I love tsundere characters (and hate yandere) characters but I feel like Hiroki is not a very good tsundere. At the beginning, his tsundere personality was caused by a broken heart. Nowaki is a very nice guy though and should have been able to heal Hiroki's heart but the fact that they've been dating the longest (but they're so terrified of their small age gap but compared to the other pairings, its nothing) should have Hiroki calm down. I won't bring it up this review (I'll do that with season 2) but Hiroki doesn't seem to change his tsundere ways that its just flat out being obnoxious and Nowaki takes it like a martyr. Uh...alas, there story arc is the one that made me tear up though (but it still could have been avoided if Hiroki wasn't such a tsundere and listened to Nowaki).

Terrorist: Personally this is my favorite pairing but is the one that has the most controversy around it due to the circumstances around it. You got Miyagi a teacher who has a 17 year old high school student interested in him. The age gap is the main reason for the controversy and not because the pairing isn't boring (I don't find it boring). Basically, Miyagi was in love with his old teacher and when she died, he couldn't love again and has had failed relationships as a result. Come Shinobu who comes into his life during the day of his wedding of Shinobu's sister...yeah. That's why it's awkward. Once the two divorced, Shinobu made his move on Miyagi...and Shinobu is the son of the head of the college Miyagi works at. The idea of getting caught and a scandal happening makes me excited...but Nakamura would never think of something like that. -_- They get the fewest episodes by default, but there episodes were different from the other two pairings and that's probably why I like them the most.

Music: The music is wonderful especially the opening. The art is amazing and this was before Japan's law that decided to tone down sex scenes (so we can get better scenes than just kissing that Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi suffered).

Overall, the first season is a good start and beside me ranting about the pairings, I think you'll be able to find a pairing you like. They get better in season 2...some of them.",1362096000,3,4162,4.587365591397849

I was surprised at how gentle and soft the story is, and you actually forget that it's love between men. The fact that they are man is really not important. and after 5 minutes you get into the story and just want them to overcome their troubles.
THIS IS A WONDERFUL LOVE STORY.
Very recommanded. ENJOY",1288051200,7,363,4.352941176470588

I've been watching this on line in it's own language and I still love it. There's two other stories but all three couples know each other on some level. I would highly recommend this and the mangas.,1282348800,,360,4.231884057971015

4075615,5,B0036BDQ60,"I love this anime, I saw it long time ago in japan.  So I bought the mangas and love it, though when I heard it was being release in the USA, I decided to purchased it.  This was my first yaoi title and since then I had read many others and have to say this one still my favorite.  It is very romantic and funny.  It follows three couples. Ir is also very clean on term of sexual content.  However, I can't say the same thing about the manga.  The manga is more explicit on the sexual content, but at least it covers all the gaps that the anime leave with and follows the story past the end of the anime.  So if you love the anime, also get the manga (right now it has 13 volumes and still going).  There are also a few spin-off from this manga, that have to do with either secondary characters or members of the publishing house (don't recall all the titles but you can search for it).

I hope that will continue the anime to cover the rest of the manga, and I can't wait to see how the manga will end.",1280102400,,1003,4.0
4075616,3,B0036BDQ60,"I don't usually watch yaoi type anime. I usually watch anime like Higurashi, Berserk, Monster, School Rumble, Oran, you name it. There is one other beside this I watched and that was gravitation which was alright. My biggest problem with these types of anime is story. Junjo Romantica doesn't have much story. Its basically switching between 4 or related guys who find romance with other guys. There is some conflict in the story but its not really anything to worry about or put you on the edge. This isn't too bad, but its kind of boring. The show does have hillarious moments but I've seen better. MY other problem is the character designs. It looks like the makers recycled the look and design of the characters. Some of the characters really do look alike which got me pretty confused. I know its a romance anime, but I've seen romances that are extremely compelling in story and that are overall better. This isn't one of them. Other than that I kind of liked this show. It was a good vacation from the chaos and action in Blue Lagoon. There are 2 seasons. I made it through the entire first season and in the second season I'm on I think episode 6 a long while back. I hope to finish the rest of the season after watching Higurashi No Naku Koro ni.",1278374400,6,1255,4.460869565217391

Season 1 (based faithfully on the popular manga by Shungiku Nakamura) introduces viewers to the trials and travails of three couples, the main one involving Misaki, a non-too-bright eighteen-year-old college freshman, and his unlikely lover, Usami, a famous and successful novelist who has zero life skills. Together they embark on a touching and often hilarious journey together that will bring both laughter and tears.
