8722265,5,B010ESRI5C,"Why am I reviewing this when Amazon says it's not available? Because I just finished watching the re-airing on EWTN, and they showed it with a new cover, so it's at least available there, and likely will he here soon. Even if you'd watched it as a 5 part miniseries on EWTN, there are reasons to own the DVD. If you don't know who Peter Kreeft and Thomas Howard are, they are both philosophers, prolific writers, and wide ranging thinkers. Both were some version of Protestant and are now Catholic, although they don't tell their stories or journeys in this series. Even though they both write lively apologetics books, this series is not really about reasons to believe either.

Instead, it's the quirky kind of show only EWTN would dare to attempt, although once it would have been standard faire when networks were more adventurous. Now it would be either too slow, too intellectual, too calm, too unsettling (this isn't entertainment-- it's making me think!), in short, too likely to lose too many viewers to run on anything like a mainstream channel.

Their loss is our gain. These shows feel live, one professor playing devil's advocate, with the other shooting from the hip, exactly the sort of thing you used to tune in to watch on public TV. But the range of topics is dazzling, one thing suggesting another, wandering, as it were, through art, literature, myth, stories by C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien (whom both authors love and have spoken and written on often). They are the sort of professors you wish you had, and now you can with this DVD set.",1491782400,2,1560,4.710622710622711
8722266,4,B010ESRI5C,"I enjoy Prof. Kreeft's works immensely and own and have read/listen to many of his books and all of his Recorded Books audio courses - many more than once.  I would love to give this DVD set five stars, but couldn't honestly do so.  The meandering progress of the dialogue format leaves me cold.  Nonetheless, I did learn many informative points - like the meaning of Sehnsucht, sweet desire, and its presentation in ""The Lord of the Rings"" and in ""The Chronicles of Narnia"", however the process was too slow for me.  From many of his writings Prof. Kreeft appears to be a Christian Platonist, but I suspect that I am too much of an Aristotelian - define the topic and explore its multitude of facets step by step - to enjoy a Platonic dialogue.  If you enjoy dialogue format by all means get this DVD - it should be five stars for you.",1454457600,,836,4.402597402597403

8722268,5,B010ESRI5C,Outstanding programs. They weave through Tolkien and CS Lewis expounding on these author's stories. Pointing out how Christianty and philosophy are used in Lord of the Rings and Chronicles of Narnia and how these myths put some light on Truths in our own lives.,1442880000,,261,4.954545454545454
