7990660,5,B000099T3Z,"i first saw Heroes of World War II Hosted by Walter Walter Cronkite when it was first broadcast as a 4 part series on TV. I recently saw it again on TV. I wanted to get it on DVD. Heroes of World War II Hosted by Walter Walter Cronkite breaks down WWII into 4 sections the attack on Pearl Harbor, the battle in the Pacific, the battle in Europe, and the Air Battle. Since this is the 70th year anniversary of VE Day, the dropping of the 2 atomic bombs, and VJ Day this is a must DVD to get.",1431820800,,490,3.91

7990663,2,B000099T3Z,"If you only concern yourself with the interviews of WWII heros, including Major Dick Winters (made famous by ""Band of Brothers""), Medal of Honor winners, and one of the pilots who shot down an enemy plane during the attack on Pearl Harbor, this DVD is worth a watch.

While the interviews will interest fans of oral history, the video footage used as a backdrop at many times does not match the stories. The frustrating part is that in some cases appropriate footage was found elsewhere in the video.

Here are some examples:

When a former crewman of a Consolidated PBY Catalina observation plane recalls his experience, the video shown is of a Lockheed P-38 Lightning pursuit (fighter) plane. There were PBYs shown during the sequences on Pearl Harbor. Why not use one of those clips?

Among the scenes of ground battles in the discussion of D-Day in Normandy are mixed in a couple of shots of US Marines from the Pacific Theater.

During a story about American battles in the Pacific, we see video of a British Avro Lancaster (that was not used in the Pacific).

Most of the Pearl Harbor footage is a Hollywood creation (both from during the war and possibly from the recent film ""Pearl Harbor""). That works, although it would have been better to show actual stills from the battle.

If you can live with anachronisms and other inaccuracies, this 2-DVD set will work. If you are a student of WWII history, aircraft fan, or maybe even a vet you may end up shaking your head through much of it. I give it 2 1/2 stars.",1322611200,6,1518,4.6
7990664,4,B000099T3Z,"I saw bits and pieces of this Walter Cronkite series when it was aired on TV a few years ago.  This 2-DVD set puts the European and Pacific theaters together in one place making titles of interest easy to access. Four programs are included on two DVD's with total running time of 180 minutes.

There are shortcomings, e. g., the ""Battle at Midway"" is not featured with any prominence and the American viewpoint is given almost exclusively.  Still, time is running out on getting interviews with our soldiers, sailors, and airmen who actually participated in World War II battles; also on getting Mr. Cronkite's expert opinion.

I would recommend this set of DVD's for anyone interested in World War II, especially from the perspective of those who were there and fought the battles.  The sneak attack on Pearl Harbor is still tough to take which is why something more on America's victory at Midway might have been a good idea.  Nonetheless, the extended coverage on Pearl Harbor should be food for thought in today's world.",1215993600,9,1024,4.822857142857143
