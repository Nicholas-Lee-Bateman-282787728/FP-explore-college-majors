D. Gray-man is a great series. It has has action, comedy, and drama. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are all pretty good. This series keeps the viewer interested with plot twists, and the introduction of great new characters. I can't find anything not to like about this series. This doesn't have anything to do with season 1, but the anime is unfinished. After the 2nd season the show just stops. I really enjoyed watching this series and it bugs the heck outta me when they just cut it off like they did with this one. They only released 51 episodes, but I think there are actually 103 out there. If you know any news of new D. Gray-man releases I'd appreciate it if you could leave me a comment on it. Anyway, this is a great series and is well worth watching.",1354665600,2,1144,4.447619047619048
