I was rooting for her the whole time, since she was able-bodied, younger, and without children or a man.  Minimum wage doesn't cut it and something should be done to assure that everyone has a decent, yet humble, home.  There is no need for people to live in mansions and be wasteful when there are people like Lou living in U-Hauls and Marie parking her car in a cemetery.",1211155200,15,514,4.494623655913978
1975396,5,B00016XNI4,"Although this documentary was done fifteen years ago, I rented it because of the title. I find it interesting to know how women do end up homeless. I remember Sixty Minutes doing a segment on homeless women when I was in high school. I have to say that these women are more resourceful than a woman who has a job and a home.
It's a shame that our legal system can barely do anything to help these women to get back on their feet. Yet, they can respond quickly to high-profile cases that are sometimes too outrageous or frivilous. These were women who had good, if not great lives. They were married with children. Some of them were working to make ends meets and not having to worry about tomorrow. Then something happened.
Marital discord, medical injury, loss of employment turned their world upside down. I felt sorry for these women because they were struggling to stay afloat when things took a turn for the worse. Some of them wouldn't turn to their families or friends for assistance; and one didn't have anyone to turn to for assistance.
The thought of what these women are going through is a reflection of what can happen to me and several other women. As much as I whined and complained about not having a place of my own and having to struggle financially, there is always a ray of sunshine.
The only thing we as women need to do is to acknowledge our presence and look out for our well-being. And help each other.
I wonder if there was ever any thought to follow-up on this documentary. One committed suicide and the other was never heard from again. It would be interesting to know what they have been doing since this documentary was made.",1178668800,9,1653,4.495016611295681
1975397,4,B00016XNI4,I like Jodie Foster and I happened to find this movie. It turned out to be so good. This movie is a documentary about hidden homeless women. Those could be any one of us. I want to have the strength of holding myself tight enough that it won't affect by any changes around me.,1113177600,9,276,4.12962962962963
1975398,5,B00016XNI4,"This is the type of film that haunts me, that reminds me to figure out what the heck I'm doing with my life to promote fair policies and foster cooperation in my community.  Unlike more recent and flashier ""social issue"" documentaries, this film, and the stories of these working homeless women, play gently and firmly on your conscience.  I remember these characters -- I'll remember them for a long time.  Foster's narration is note-perfect.
I'm thankful for films like these.  The trick, then, is for me, for us, to turn it into to some form of support.",1081468800,19,556,4.701030927835052

8007439,5,B00016XNI4,"Sad reality of life today, This is a excellent documentary on homeless women  but it applies to men as well. This was filmed in the early 1990s so it is even worse now in the recession or depression as I view it , because nothing has changed since then. No one thinks about the hidden homeless or poor living on social security paycheck to paycheck with family or in a car or alley ,shelter, or other  place. Or someone who has nothing at all, watching this film will make you think seriously in todays uncertain world that this can happen to me or anyone else. If you get sick with a chronic illness or lose a job in your 50s how impossible life would be without hope of a job and income. Think about it and it will scare you . This is a film everyone should watch because it can happen to any of us.",1408665600,2,801,4.128205128205129
8007440,5,B00016XNI4,"These women seems so nice and normal, but they are all living a very sad life. It's very depressing seeing them living like that. Maybe they just made some bad choices in their life. No money, no family, no social life. These pretty women so lonely and with no one care about them. Maybe they should all live together, and make friends with each other.",1391990400,2,352,4.430769230769231
8007441,4,B00016XNI4,"Some homeless women obviously suffer from mental illness but the two I felt the most sympathy toward had multiple kids with zero support.  Yet some show a strange stubborn independence.  One woman living in a U-Haul (no joke) pretends she never even HEARD of section 8 housing.  Another grudgingly becomes a live in cook, pining for the old days of having her OWN servants.  Most emphatically reject food stamps or welfare.  Their problems go way deeper than a simple thousand bucks moving expenses.",1359417600,2,499,4.963855421686747
8007442,3,B00016XNI4,"After publishing my book ""Shadow Women: Homeless Women's Survival Stories"" (Sheed & Ward, 1990), I had many offers from producers, directors, and stars for a movie contract.  An error by my publisher resulted in my choice of director, and Ohayon approached me, begging for the rights in exchange for fundraisers for my 501(c)nonprofit org: Women Organized Against Homelessness. She said that by giving her the rights to a film, her org, Cinewomen, would have their first break in the ""Old Boy's Net"" in Hollywood.  I believed her, helped her find some undetectable homeless women, and was in the film for a comment. The original product ""thanked my org and me for my input.""  It has been deleted and Ohayon never fulfilled her promise.  She has taken all of the credit for my long years of research, doctoral dissertation on the topic, and books published.  She appeared on Oprah, taking credit for my work.

I did appear on ""60 Minutes"" (1992) with some undetectable homeless women, and it was a disaster.  Practically no one believed that such people exist -- living amongst us without our knowledge of their situations.  It didn't help that CBS deleted the solutions posited by these women and focused only on exploiting how they were living out of personalized vehicles in Beverly Hills and Malibu.

As for helping these women who are trying to be self-sufficient, my org members have been doing so since 1982.  I was one of this subculture of the larger homeless population in the 1970s.  I lived on a deserted island for a long time before I thought of asking for a fully-financed Ph. D. from my ""old"" university.  I have websites that describe who these women are and how they are surviving. If there are any questions, just type in my name on Google and find out more information.

This doc was made without any creative control on my part and I do not think it was well done. The woman on the cover and the doc's ""star"" was a very visible ""street person,"" living in a junk-filled vehicle that would not be typical of this subculture.  The doc does tell the truth about a previously unknown population, but in the 2000 era, there are now also many men using the same tactics that women have used for decades.  The major economic downturn has created so many more people who are living in alternative housing and creating self-employment. (My other book, ""Organizational and Community Responses to Domestic Abuse and Homelessness"" (Garland, 1994) is more apt to be of importance to housing and org professionals.)

I have raw film waiting for editing for two docs that show how to alleviate homelessness among all stable homeless people. I have a historical model to use in every state where homeless people can live and work with sweat equity and self-sufficiency.  It is already being accomplished.",1334707200,11,2807,4.814583333333333
8007443,5,B00016XNI4,"It was Jodie Foster's name (as narrator) that drew me to watch this. But it was the homeless women profiled who made this film unforgettable. And no, they're not at all what most people would expect when they think of a 'homeless person'. That surprise is one of the great values of this film.

Btw, I was astonished at the nasty reviews here that ignorantly insulted these women. Talk about kicking someone when they're down. And these personal attacks ignore reality - including the courage it would take to let a filmmaker 'out' you like they did.

I found all these women to be brave, articulate, dignified and resourceful. They also tried to stay positive. But yes, you can see that a few were really struggling to keep hope alive. And why not - I mean, put yourself in their shoes. IMO, their perseverance makes this video unforgettable.

As for the director, good work in finding such people to show the story, including giving us the viewpoint of the children. But while the director did show useful context about the challenges finding housing and getting child support, I think with just a few more minutes, she could have made the picture bigger. For example, she could have shown what 'shelters' are like - and why so many women would rather sleep in a car than go there. And above all, look at other options, because it doesn't have to be like this. FInally, an update later on what happened to these women would also add a lot to the story. We come to care about them. We want to know that they're ok.

But despite my wish-list, I give this film 5 stars because of its insight, advice to women and real personal impact.",1330646400,3,1633,4.54421768707483
8007444,3,B00016XNI4,"A Good doc....add to your JF collection. Music was a disappiontment, as it was merely instumental background.",1282521600,,109,5.470588235294118
8007445,4,B00016XNI4,"It Was a Wonderful Life had quite an effect on me--I was troubled by what had happened to these ""hidden homeless"" women who live out of their cars and who dress well enough that if I saw them walking down the street I never would have guessed that they were homeless. The documentary flows at a good pace; I was never bored although I do agree with reviewers who note that it's certainly not the most polished documentary I've ever seen. Honestly, I was unaware of the extent of this problem; the film raised my awareness of this issue and if it was a problem then I can just imagine the extent of the problem in today's ""Great Recession!""

We meet several women who actually lead quite a comfortable life--or at least a solidly middle class existence before they ran out of money because of a medical illness that apparently was not covered by insurance (or perhaps they lacked health insurance, they film doesn't go into this), bad investments or deadbeat dads/ex-husbands who simply refused to make their child support payments. These women are remarkably talented artists, teachers, realtors and more and they are every bit as well educated as the filmmakers say that they are; one of them is quite a chanteuse and it pained me greatly to see how she ended up homeless with her hopes and chances for subsidized ""Section 8"" housing dwindled, leaving her in a state of despair and deep depression.

We also learn how these women rarely seek out financial support such as food stamps and public assistance--I assume this is out of pride and a strong determination to make their own way. When interviewed, these women didn't think that they were desperate enough to apply for welfare. Granted, there is some discussion about barriers to collecting public assistance but it's not as in-depth as I would have liked it to be.

The film doesn't attempt to suggest answers for this problem except in the area of ex-husbands who didn't make child support payments--in that arena they state that there have to be stricter laws to be sure that deadbeat dads make their child support payments in a timely fashion. I would have liked the film more if they had explored potential solutions in more depth but it painted such a strong picture of homeless women living out of their cars (or, in one case, a U-Haul truck at times when Lou, a homeless woman, could afford it) that this will haunt me for quite some time to come.

All in all, this is a well done documentary even if it was apparently made on a rather tight budget. I recommend this film for anyone interested in these issues.",1282003200,11,2575,4.652747252747253
8007446,2,B00016XNI4,"Though relevant and very heartbreaking, i'd like you keep in mind that these women are flawed in some crucial way. No government should have to take care of physically and mentally capable grown adult women, that's too f'n much.  They weren't one paycheck away from poverty at all if you examine this. They all made the financial mistake of depending on one thing, a man or a job or that they were smart enough to make a wise investment with ALL THEIR MONEY. It's attractive to do this but it's been said over and over, create your own financial independence whether you are a man or a woman. Reena is the saddest case of all, hanging on to a husband that's been over for what, 15 years?  She had 15 years of some sort of financial support before her rent stopped being payed and she got evicted, though they never explain how she came by her money. Her husband swears he paid all the support he was suppose to, and I think he did. I think he finally cut the purse string and she just wanted to hit bottom as a sort of tantrummy punishment to the world for her unhappiness. She didn't allow her young son to go to Hawaii with her ex-husband because she needed his help while they were being evicted!?!? When she's got four or five other fully grown sons she can depend on??? Let that poor kid go to Hawaii! It reveals what a wacky, greedy, sad woman she is. She should have gotten a job a long time ago, this is a crucial flaw. If anything, we need to educate our women not to be dependent upon others, and perhaps this is the DVD's value, a sort of scared straight for females.",1264118400,2,1578,4.291946308724833
8007447,2,B00016XNI4,A documentary about homeless women in america. It could have been done in half the time but still it highlights the plight of the homeless that a lot of us tend to ignore. After 15 minutes I found this film started to get quite boring and tended to repeat the same message over and over again through the medium of different women who by the way are incredible human beings.,1223510400,2,374,4.357142857142857
