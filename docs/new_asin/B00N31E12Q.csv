6608249,5,B00N31E12Q,"This documentary shows the importance of comics and super heroes and that they are so much more than disposal entertainment.  Seeing how Batman has helped these people through tough times and inspired them to fight their problems and show true courage.  Batman was their inspiration and you will find that the people featured here will pass that inspiration on to you.  Bring the tissues and be ready for much more than a ""look at my collection"" documentary about batman fans.",1415145600,,476,4.925
6608250,5,B00N31E12Q,This film was uplifting and a true picture of what humanity can be when inspired.

There is literally something for everyone, and as other reviewers have said the film is not so much about Batman as it is about the human experience. I found it incredibly positive and refreshing!",1415059200,,286,4.74

I'm a huge fan and I would certainly recommend this to anyone, whether they enjoy Batman or not. At times it really pulls your heart strings, other times you're enjoying a hearty laugh. It was a wonderful experience going to the theater and seeing an auditorium full of people wearing Batman attire. They also had a panel at Comic Con where we all got pumped about the upcoming work. It's a must see for sure!",1415059200,,516,4.442105263157894

6608265,5,B00N31E12Q,"This isn't the best Batman film ever made because of special effects, crazy action sequences, or Oscar-worthy performances. There are none of those things in this film actually.

What makes this film the best is it answers the question of ""why"" so many people love and admire Batman. Most of us may not be rich, have a cool car, and an awesome costume, but we've all dealt with loss. We've all struggled and had to face adversity head-on when we wanted to do nothing but run the other way.

That's who Batman is and that's why Batman could be anybody.",1415059200,7,551,4.5
6608266,5,B00N31E12Q,"This is one of the most inspirational documentaries I have ever watched.  I was actually one of the Kickstarter backers for the project so I first got to see it a few months ago.  The documentary is, at it's heart, about the inspirational power of stories.  The fact that they used the Batman character as their focus brings the historic power of stories into modern sensibilities.  Batman may be the driving focus but it is not really about him.  The stories in this film are inspirational and amazing.  The people that this movie is about either use the Batman character as an example to overcome a great struggle in their lives or as an example to live up to while trying to help as many people as they can with no thought of personal gain.  The people in this movie are not trying to be superheroes, but they are heroes nonetheless.

I cannot recommend this movie any higher.",1415059200,7,879,4.518987341772152

6608271,5,B00N31E12Q,"Just a phenomenal film. It's funny in parts, tear jerking in parts, and always uplifting. It's a movie that spotlights not just the result of underdogs triumphing, but moreso the importance of the fight of the underdog. You leave the movie inspired to do something good in your community, after watching the great things that the subjects of the movie have done.",1414972800,3,362,4.854838709677419
