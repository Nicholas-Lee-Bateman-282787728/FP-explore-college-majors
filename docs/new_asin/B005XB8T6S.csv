4902798,5,B005XB8T6S,"The best documentary ever on mustangs. Based on extraordinary  long-term investigations by the narrator, it follows one herd from the birth of a foal through his life cycle changes, in relation to other horses in the herd and in relation to other herds. Takes up the debate around Bureau of Land Management roundups. Truly extraordinary. This particular package includes all 3 films in the series.",1386115200,5,397,5.107692307692307
4902799,5,B005XB8T6S,"I loved the shows when they aired separately on PBS's ""Nature"". Now I am proud and pleased to have all three in my video collection. Real life - real drama - watch it with the whole family and see how truly wild horses live.",1375747200,4,224,4.113636363636363
4902800,5,B005XB8T6S,"I enjoy these videos for learning about how to ""see"" horse body language in my own horses.  Even in domestic horses, the way they interact is very similar.  It has helped me.",1353110400,3,174,4.40625
4902801,5,B005XB8T6S,"This one has it all! Gorgeous scenery, beautiful wild horses, engaging foals,tender moments and fierce battles. While it is a family film there are some moments not suited for young ones such as a stallion killing a disabled foal and some mating scenes. The complexities of the relationships among the horses was fascinating to discover. I enjoyed this very much.",1338336000,8,363,5.066666666666666
