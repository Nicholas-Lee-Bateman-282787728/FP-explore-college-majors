3524269,5,B001D261TS,"Buy this DVD for anybody you know who has knee pain or wants to avoid knee pain in the future. The exercises are great and easy to follow. Chantal is a Physical Therapist and wonderful instructor and the routines are well rounded to improve all areas supporting the knees. The DVD looks like a million bucks and is very informative so you can be proud to give this DVD as a gift. And don't worry, this DVD is for any fitness level so if you are a in top shape or you are 65 year old grand-dad, it's for you!",1228435200,14,507,4.08

3524322,5,B001D261TS,"4 years ago I used this fantastic program to supplement my rehab from ACL surgery. Then a few years later I gave it to my dad to help him with his knees. And just recently I injured my knee again horseback riding and had totally forgotten my PT exercises so I bought this dvd AGAIN. And I'd give it away again to help someone else and buy it again for me because this dvd is THAT EDSENTIAL to have for those of us for whom ""bad knees"" is now a thing.

3524324,4,B001D261TS,"The instructor does a good job explaining each move and what area that move is targeting.

The stretch section is absolutely wonderful.

The 7 minute mini workout is ok, but not something I'd reach for often.

My only complaint with the main workout is that there is no ""exercises only"" option.  Each time, you have to fast forward through the explaining part.  It would greatly help if you could select the workout with or without the extra info.",1462838400,,447,4.67948717948718

However, once you've gone through all of the explanations once it moves waaaaay too slow to get much out of.

3524328,1,B001D261TS,"Please listen to the reviewers who have noted that you must sit through 5 minutes of ads each and every time you try to watch this.  You can NOT fast forward. You can NOT skip them.

In addition, this is virtually useless as a day to day exercise routine, as she stops exercising every two to three exercises to give a several minute lecture on the next muscle group.  There is no separate routine that is composed of just the exercises.  So you cannot have an uninterrupted routine.  The quick routine at the end includes only a few of the total exercises.  And remember, you cannot access that quick routine without sitting through many minutes of ads.

This is insulting hucksterism and very, very poorly thought out.  Do not waste your money on something that is not useable.",1454803200,,779,4.594202898550725

3524340,4,B001D261TS,Kinda boring but a good video.  Has a longer program and a 7 minute quick one.  Some of it is similar to exercises i had after a knee surgery.. however some of them are quite stressful on the knee... so be careful if you have had surgery.. i don't do all the ones in the video.,1448755200,,277,3.9285714285714284
3524341,5,B001D261TS,"I normally try to do a workout 4 or 5 times before commenting unless it's horrible.  In this case, I felt good results right away from the knee strengthening exercises.  I have been working out a lot; hiking, biking, step, swimming, and weight lifting.  My knees have been bothering  me to the point where it was painful to walk, bend the knees, walk up steep hills and more.  I did the workout with the commentary which explains how different muscles affect the knees and immediately felt relief.

There is a bonus section with 4 workouts, I really liked the 7 minute workout and balance section.  There is an itband message, but a tennis ball is needed for that section.  I also did the 4th section which is design your own workout (so I really did the exercise program twice).  Moving forward, I will be doing the design your own, this cuts out the commentary.  I will also do the 7 minute workout if I have limited time.

The other bonuses to this workout is you get a good ab workout, because you have to brace your belly to stay aligned and safe.  I also see this workout as a body shaping for the lower body.  The exercises are done in a controlled and precise way, approximately 10 or 20 reps, but I could definitely feel the burn and I got winded.",1447200000,5,1256,4.3852813852813854

3524346,4,B001D261TS,"Great video for folks with knee pain related to weakness or lack of flexibility in the related muscles and connective tissues. My knees began feeling better almost immediately, and doing the video about 3 times/week I really notice a difference. My knees feel stronger and more secure, I have less pain, and I am able to do more in my other workouts (e.g., able to squat or lunge without feeling pressure in my knees).

Chantal takes you through a variety of exercises and stretches that build strength and flexibility in the quads, hamstrings, and glutes. Many begin with an easier version and then graduate to a more challenging version---such as heel raises standing on both feet followed by heel raises one leg at a time, or the hamstring-strengthening ""bridge lift"" on the floor followed by one in which the feet are propped on a chair. If you watch the full video, she does a great job (with some nice graphic aids) explaining WHY each exercise is related to knee strength. The full video is chaptered with scene selection, so you can choose to jump straight to one muscle group if you wish. The bonus options section gives you the ability to design your own session, choosing just the exercises you want to do in the order you want to do them. This allows you to skip the educational material and just do the specific exercises you want.

I have only two complaints. One, and most annoying, there is not a ""play all exercises without the educational material"" option. This seems like an obvious premix, but it is missing. The only way to do this is to navigate through several levels of menu and ""Design your own"" selecting all 10 exercises. What should be a two-click option instead takes about fifteen. Second, I find the ""7 minutes to save your knees"" to be rushed. You're moving between positions and between floor work and standing, but she doesn't really give you time to move and get ready; I find I either have to use the pause button or miss reps. Maybe the marketing people told them 7 minutes is psychologically more likely to get people to do it than 8 minutes? For these two failings, the video gets four stars instead of five.",1427068800,10,2147,4.63254593175853

It's very educational and explains everything, and I found that all the information given in this DVD is what I was told when doing PT by my therapist. This is great because you can customize which segments you want to do and once you give it a watch through, you can skip all the informational parts and get right to the strengthening and stretching moves.

My sister and I (in our late 50's) started doing the full routine every other day and the ""Seven Minutes to Save the Knees"" on days in between.  We were amazed that for both of us the first pain that eased up was our hip pain.  A few weeks ago, we got out of the routine because of illness and a vacation, and both the hip and knee pain came back for me.  So this week we started the routine again.  After only four days, my hip and knee pain are both reduced significantly.  Our lesson learned: keep this up - it works!!!",1400716800,,601,4.008403361344538

I was in PT for 8 weeks with little progress.

This DVD  shows many of and MORE of the exercises I paid for ea week at PT, and I can do this anytime I want , without leaving my home.  In reality, this could have replaced all those visits in the wintry weather and co-pays!  Even better!

Get ready with the fast forward button as others have said,  but if you have any patience , this DVD is well worth it.  First time through, I used my knee braces ( just sleeves) and now I am able to  do all this with out them.  I use an icepack afterwards for 10-20 mins. with feet up on the  hassok as was directed by my PT.

3524395,5,B001D261TS,"I am a 43 year old with the following knee problems:

 - Patellar tracking issues, multiple dislocations
 - Patellar realignment surgery on my right knee to prevent any more dislocations
 - Chondrocalcinosis a.k.a. calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, a lovely form of rheumatic arthritis
 - Hoffa's Syndrome in my left knee (impinged fatty pad) a.k.a. Jumpers Knee
 - Bakers cyst behind right knee

On top of all this, I love to cycle and run. I also prefer to do some heavier exercises, such as squats and lunges, in order to keep my muscles strong and lessening the work the joints themselves have to do. I love it enough that I often just deal with the pain, but sometimes he pain gets so great that it keeps me away. And then the vicious cycle starts-- in too much pain to exercise, the legs get weak, the pain increases. I used to get injections in my knee of an artificial synovial fluid which helped a lot, but insurance decided that it wasn't helping and no longer authorizes these injections. So I started searching for alternatives. To be honest I didn't like being dependent on those expensive and time-consuming injections anyways.

I gave this DVD a shot, and it immediately improved the pain in my knees. I use it both at the end of the day, as well as at the beginning of a day that I know is going to be active. It's easy to scale the exercises to make them more strenuous if needed, or if one is just starting out, the video gives some alternate poses to make things easier. It's easy to watch and follow, with good explanations of why the different muscle groups are being exercised. I combine this with a diet and lifestyle that keeps inflammation at a minimum, and I think I have plenty years of activity left.

The injury took a long time to heal, and I occasionally still have minor flare ups.

The main part of the video is kind of short (30 minutes) but considering you don't want to spend an hour doing stretching and exercises, I think that is the perfect amount of time to allot.

Pros
-  prompts for form and muscle tightening
-  anatomical explanation

Cons
- inability to do an exercise by exercise, stretch by stretch etc. custom program. Stretches, for example, are all or nothing,  and there's no way to include the IT band loosening. I have poor memory for movement, so I need all the prompts possible.
- very few exercises included
- the lengthy advertising, which cannot be skipped. HATE it!!!!
- thoroughly annoying and repetitive music",1392508800,,634,4.616071428571429
3524402,3,B001D261TS,"I am a runner and have one knee that is problematic. I've had surgery on it once, and while the surgery helped in some ways, in other ways the knee has never been the same. I have been through physical therapy after my surgery and am back to running more than ever before but not without occasional knee popping and pain. With that in mind I started doing more stretching and exercises to strengthen my knees. Although the results aren't perfect, there is improvement from the strategy.

I had previously been exposed to some of the exercises that Chantal Donnelly demonstrates in this video, but this is one of the best overall presentations on knee-related exercises I have seen. The exercises and the anatomy behind them are quite well explained. While I generally found the strength exercises easy, some of the stretches were substantially more challenging, and I have adopted them with a great vigor. The presentation stresses holding each stretch for 30 seconds, and that's a noble goal, though not everyone will be able to do that with all stretches at first, which is fine. Practice makes perfect. I liked that there were easy and advanced versions of the different exercises and stretches presented, and the nature of the program allows for mixing and matching exercises and stretches to suit individual needs. I don't have IT band issues, for instance, so I tend to emphasize other things, but someone with IT band problems will find gold elsewhere within this DVD.

My biggest objection to this DVD is the insulting length of unskippable ads at the beginning of the presentation for Gaiam branded items. Was it not enough that I bought the DVD? Now I have to be assaulted with advertisements for things I don't want to get to the exercises? Apparently so. The issue here is that after two views I'm sure there are nuances I haven't learned from the DVD yet, but I am wholly unwilling to sit through the ads again to get to the presentation. I think the instructor does a good job with her presentation, but I won't buy any more Gaiam products in the future as I don't want an omnipresent hard sell every time I start the DVD over.

I went to a couple of doctors which recommended Physical Therapy and use some other topical steriod (which I did not use).  The PT really did not do any good at all!  During that time, I decided to try a DVD I had at home for the lower back and hips (Viniyoga Therapy for the Low Back, Sacrum & Hips with Gary Kraftsow) and that gave me relief!  Mentioned this to the PT's and they just ignored it.

All of you with knee problems, get to the root of the problem.  Try to realign your hips and spine first. Do the Viniyoga DVD (First Therapy) every day for at least 3 weeks and incorporate it into your life for maintenance.  Incorporate the Strong Knees DVD after that.  It's a good DVD, but I think that it's more for strengthening and if you are looking for relief, do the Viniyoga DVD.  Skip through the Strong Knee's DVD infomercials and it's very helpful to watch the information relating to the muscles groups.  Definitely shows you that the pain usually stems from some place away from where it hurts.

I dropped the PT and I was so-o-o glad I did.  The PT's just wanted me to add more and more weights to various stretches and exercises.  I firmly believe that if I continued with their therapy, I would end up having knee surgery.

There are no easy fixes and don't wait!  Take the time to try the Viniyoga Therapy for the Low Back, Sacrum & Hips DVD and then later, incorporate the Strong Knees DVD if you choose to.  Good luck!",1361491200,12,1601,4.231023102310231

My Dr. said part of me feeling less discomfort was to strengthen those muscles around my knees since I have a shifting patella.

The Pros: This video has a detailed explanation of why you are working the muscles in this video and why they relate to your knee pain. It is very informative and easy to understand explanations. The exercises work, and you can feel the targeted areas days after you have exercised!

The Cons: There is no way to have just the exercise parts without the explanations, so you have to stop workout to fast forward in between scenes to just get to exercise. There is no list of supplies needed for the exercises so I recommend either watching video first so you can see what you need: Basically you will need a chair, a rolled up towel, and a wall/somewhere to lean and slide down in for some exercises.

I liked the pace of the 30 minute workout. I never felt like it was too slow or too rushed. She spent a full 30 seconds per stretch and the instruction on form was very helpful and clear.

I am impressed by how comprehensive the DVD is: Hips, glutes, hamstrings, abductors, calves and quads. The ONLY move I would suggest they add is the one legged dead lift (or easier - cone touch) as it has really helped build my hip strength which has been helping me with my alignment/knee issues.

The IT band massage info is a 'bonus' selection and uses the tennis ball method. I would suggest Gaiam spend a little more time on this bonus selection and show several foam roller moves for the knee instead.

The therapy was starting to work and the therapist recommended joining a fitness center to continue the regimen. I did that for a while but didn't want the expense and stopped in October. I found that just a couple of weeks without exercise the pain started to return. Coincidentally while reading a health magazine Strong Knees was advertised. I ordered it and after doing it a couple times my knee pain dissipated. I am happy I purchased this and don't have to continue going to the gym.

3524476,5,B001D261TS,"A little background on my knee pain: I've been having some dull pain and discomfort around the knee area for the past 4 years. Initially, the doctor I went to at the time saw that there was a very small misalignment of my kneecap, so he had referred me to physical therapy to correct the problem.  Being in my early 20's at the time, I didn't really think much of it but went through the expensive physical therapy anyway.  It did help stop the pain for a couple of years, so I had stopped doing the exercises from physical therapy.

The knee pain returned two years later and was worse. I didn't think it was the same problem, but another doctor had confirmed it was still the kneecap misalignment and suggested an once-and-for-all solution of surgery.  He had also mentioned that physical therapy may or may not help much at all.  Being fairly physically active, the thought of a surgery was a bit taunting, so I looked for alternative options, thus this DVD.

I did the exercises from the DVD, and a lot of them are similar to what I did in physical therapy.  My knee pain went away in about 2 weeks.  Now I have to do the exercises at least once every other day to avoid knee pain, or it would return in a week without the exercises.  This works for me pretty well, as I really don't want to get the surgery.

I usually do the strengthening exercises and occasionally the massaging part. I rarely do the stretching part of the DVD because I go to yoga 1-3 times a week anyway. I did have to modify some of the strengthening exercises from the knowledge I've gained from yoga to protect my neck/upper back. I've memorized the 8 or so exercises, so I can do most of them on the go, like when I was traveling in Europe last month.

As a bonus, when I come home late from work, and it's dark outside and I feel uncomfortable doing some exercises outdoors, such as walking up and down the hills (I don't like exercising in a gym setting), these exercises at least keep me moving a bit indoors.",1321747200,4,1992,4.342318059299191

3524480,5,B001D261TS,"First of all I very recently started having knee issues and have done this video only a few times so cannot tell you if it is part of a resolution to my pain.  Still I am fairly frugal and my local library did not carry this and I have no regrets about the purchase.

things that make it laudable:
1) Instructor is straightforward, encouraging but not annoyingly perky
2) The exercises are varied and well-explained and take up a finite period of time (36 minutes)
3) Anatomical reasons for each exercise or stretch are explained
4) Despite being rather active before my knee issue, I was pleasantly surprised to find some of these exercises really challenged me.
5)Instructor made me feel confident I would not get more injured by:
a) explaining exercises well
b)giving caveats (make sure the pillow is below your hips to protect your back)
c) and giving permission to stop or stay at a low level in case of pain

Things I would improve:
1) there is no heads up about props.  Be sure to have on hand the following before starting: a chair, a towel to roll, a pillow and a strap (like a yoga strap)
2) The models were helpful but a bit creepy, pretty women but they never smile, seemed a bit unnatural and made it feel more like work.
3) video angle: sometimes the instructor would say ""you only need to lift this high"" and the camera would be on someone else
4) captive audience commercials for other products at beginning: I spent $14 to own this, no need to shamelessly try to get me to keep buying, made me feel you just have your bottom line not my health in mind at Gaia
5) Music was a bit new agey especially during anatomy parts which I find distracting and irritating but as I become more comfortable with the routine I will use my own music.

I know how frustrating it can be for busy people to become injured and the prospect of using a video in lieu of or as a supplement to PT is appealing and this one despite some flaws, seems well worth the investment.  Assuming all goes well I will keep this video as part of my active routine even after healing for healthy knee maintenance.

The Cons: For the DVD manufacturer. You start the DVD and there are 3 commercials then 4 'presented by' credit openings, so you spend about 5 minutes getting to the meat of the matter.

Cons: The menu. If you just play the exercises through you'll be frustrated because the presenter will give you a lot of interesting detail about your knees and muscles before each exercise. To avoid this what you need to do, is to go to the 'Extras part of the menu. In there is a sub-menu that lets you arrannge the exercises in the order you want to do them. This should have been at the top of the menu.

3524482,4,B001D261TS,"When I was in high school I ran track and had some alignment issues. I suspected something was amiss, but my track coach shrugged and said to ""run through the pain"". Anyway, I suspect that certain muscle groups in my legs were stronger than others, although i'm not sure why - maybe not doing the right stretches, or focusing too much on repetitive workouts that use the same exercises.

Anyhow, that was years ago, and I thought I'd try this DVD.

Pros: It is fairly slow paced and is not extremely intense.
I like that because I can mix in it with other DVDs when I want a very light workout that is also helping me to achieve balanced muscle groups.
This is also a good one to start with if you've had to take a break from exercise for some reason and are not in the same good shape you usually are in.

On the DVD, C.D. actually shows diagrams of the Muscle groups which correlate with knee problems and does a very professional job of explaining how each group affects alignment. She allows for skipping stretches that may cause you pain and encourages you to return to them later once you have strengthened the muscle group by doing easier excercises on the DVD.

The best word for this DVD might be : gentle.

As an active 30-something, I won't say it was a tremendous workout. However, it did leavea small burn and I feel a pleasantly sore sensation in each of the muscle groups I worked out. I did the video with three friends who also gave this feedback.

I really liked the fact that on the DVD menu, you can mix and match the order of the exercises.

Cons:
One thing I disliked about the video was that when you needed to use a Prop, it suddenly appeared on the screen without giving the viewer time to go get the Prop (chair; towel; and stretching band). However, we just paused it. I shouldnt think of this as a dealbreaker if I were considering buying this video.

One other thing was that my friends and I did not have stretching bands, so we simply took a towel, folded it lenthwise in half, and used it for the exercises shown in the video. It worked well for us.

The title is good and forthright, although I wonder if in small letters you might want to put ""Lower Body Stretches for"" above the bold large ""Strong Knees"" lettering.

I enjoyed this video and would recommend it to anyone who is slightly out of shape or has some slight alignment issues.  If you have serious pain, however it's probably best to consult a doctor.  I have had physical therapy for a pulled ligament in my foot in the past and that type of thing really requires a professional.  I do remember that she recommended me to do the IT band stretching with a foam roller (which really hurts by the way - it is very uncomfortable at best), and I think that if this video can get me to a more flexible place without the foam roller, I'm cool with that.  I haven't needed to use a F.R. in awhile, but it probably wouldn't hurt to start that up again either, since it's good for you to not have your IT be too tight.",1291161600,,3004,4.3126110124333925

There is a lot of talking, which I had read about in other reviews.  It's good information and once I heard it, I just skipped to the exercises.  I really like the seven minute section.  I do this every other day and it's really improved the way my knees feel. You can also create your own workout by clicking on specific sections and then putting them together.

I've only just gotten the dvd, but having gone through all the formatting options, listened to all the explanatory portions, and tried the exercises, I not only have no complaints, I'm glad glad glad to have found this dvd.

Effective, easy to follow, choices of proceeding - definitely worth while for me.

I like understanding the whys and whats; I like the muscle-body graphics; I like the reminders and explanations why a foot needs to be turned outward or to relax my shoulders etc; I like the short exercise option; and I like the ability to not only do only the exercises if I choose or like or need, but can choose how many of them, and, incredibly, in which order - finally someone who's beginning to take advantage of the programming available to be put on a dvd.

It has good information, tips and some different exercise & stretching methods I haven't encountered before.  The commercials at the beginning of the DVD are annoying but I just FF through them; didn't watch them at all.  Also, the other annoying part of this video is the fact the instructor describes each exercise at a different location prior to actually viewing it being done at the exercise site.  That didn't bother me so much but it was the fact that similar exercises were not clumped together (floor vs standing) so I wasn't prepared for the next segment.

As I continue these exercises my knee is getting stronger and stronger and the pain is diminishing. A few of the reviewers were confused about using the DVD and put off by commercials etc. Just skip past the commercials and after watching the 1st long explanations of things, you can go straight to the specific exercises and click on the ones you want. Also there is a short set of exercises for when a person has less time. Very helpful.

I've seen immediate improvement, which is not to say I'm pain free, but I have hope now. I've seen complaints about the menu and how people have to watch the commercials over and over.

Thanks to the reviewers who pointed out that the Bonus section allows you to skip much of the explanations and design your own routine. I thought the explanations were very helpful at first, but not needed after the first few viewings. It didn't really bother me much, however, I just did a few more reps while she talked.

I agree with other posters in that there are too many commercials for other dvds at the start of the program. I found this easy to deal with as I just pushed the next ""chapter button"" until the menu appeared (I think I have to press the button 3 or 4 times). Some mentioned the dvd is very wordy and it can be a little tedious to listen to the information every time one works out. I didn't find this to be the case as I only listened to the entire dvd the first time I followed it. Otherwise I go to the Bonus section and choose the ""Create your own workout"" option. This allows you to do the exercises and stretches with less discussion. I found the exercises to be well cued and well demonstrated. I found in my case, my knees immediately feel better while doing the stretching program so I am planning to incorporate those stretches into my regular routine.

I did find the overall workout a little easy for me. It is a great workout for beginners and I believe it may be accessible for those who need a gentle workout due to injuries. Given the intention of this workout, I think it is paced appropriately. Since my knee issues are minor and seem to be caused by tightness (hence why the stretching helps), I decided to try some of the exercises with adjustable ankle weights. This seemed to be a good strengthening level for me. I found some exercises very challenging such as those that target the abductors and glut. medius. So I plan to continue this workout for a while to see if it helps develop more even strength in all the muscles that support the knees.

Overall, this is a well-done and informative dvd program.",1261526400,17,1799,4.429003021148036

However, you do not have to watch the informational part every time -- you can easily watch only the excercise/stretching bits in any order you choose by going to the bonus features. In fact, I love it that you can select which excercises and in which order, this is one feature that puts this video far ahead of any other excercise video for me. The bonus features is also where the 7-minute workout can be found, as well as the self-massage section and balance section (although, frankly, I was disappointed at how simple and basic those last one was).

The ads bother me as well, and I really resent that they have these ads at the beginning of this video; however, I didn't seem to have a problem skipping over them.",1260748800,4,948,4.479768786127168

I've been doing the exercises for three weeks now, and really notice a difference.  I'm also having less of a problem with plantar faciitis, which has plagued me for the past 6 months.

If you go to the extra features, you can just string together the exercises without the full description of why you're doing them.  I do the exercises about 5 times a week -- I try to alternate between the full set and the 7-minute set.

I've also loaned the DVD to two friends who have had knee replacements, and after trying it once, both ordered their own copy.",1260144000,7,775,4.202702702702703
3524499,5,B001D261TS,"This DVD is very thorough and well produced.  It covers both weakness and tightness of Quad muscles, Hip flexors, Inner Thigh muscles (adductors), Ham String muscles, Calf Muscles (upper calf and Achilles Tendon), Gluteus Maximus muscles, Gluteus Medius muscles, and the IT (Illiotibia) Band.  Doing the main program, you will quickly discover which muscles are tight and/or weak!  You will need a mat, bath towel, stretching band or long belt, sturdy chair, and a wall (for the wall slides).  The advertising at the beginning of the DVD is a little annoying, but can be skipped very easily using the ""skip"" or ""next"" button on your DVD remote (you will need to push this button a total of three times in order to skip all three ads).  The ""7 Minutes to Save Your Knees"" exercise routine found in the Bonus Section is excellent if you don't have time to do the full program on any given day.  It includes the modified leg raise for the quads, an inner thigh stretch, hamstring stretch, a combined exercise for the gluteus medius and maximus (leg lifts and circles), a standing quad stretch, upper calf stretch, and IT band stretch.
I was surprised at all the reviewers complaining that there is no option to do the main exercise routine without all of the explanations and diagrams!  Apparently, these reviewers never checked out the ""Design Your Own Program"" in the bonus section.  All 10 exercises (including the stretching segment) are listed in here and you can select any that you want in any order (including repeats) up to 10 exercises.  If you just want to play the main exercise program without all the info, just select each exercise in order using your ""select"" button and ""down arrow"" button on your DVD remote.  After you select the 10th exercise, the program will begin to play with just the exercises.  It only takes 20 seconds to do this and it is a lot easier than constantly fast forwarding past parts that you don't want to see.  If you're rushed for time or you just want to focus on a few trouble spots, you can select only those exercises that you want to do and push ""done"" to start your program.  You can even repeat an exercise within your custom program by selecting that exercise twice.  If you just want to do the stretch program, just select ""stretch"" and ""done"" and it starts to play.  LOVE THIS FEATURE!  Here is a breakdown of the exercises in the main program:
Modified Leg Raise (3min31sec, beginner level exercise works quads, hip flexors, & inner thigh)
Wall Slides (3:02, advanced level exercise works quads, hip flexors, & inner thigh)
Bridge (2:45, Beg. hamstrings)
Bridge on Chair (2:37, Advanced hamstrings)
Double Heel Raises (1:26, Beg. Calf))
Single Heel Raises (2:06, Advanced Calf raises, a little tough on the ankles!)
Clams/ Side Leg Lifts/Side Leg Circles (4:58, Beg-Advanced routine for Gluteus Medius)
Standing Hip Extension (2:12, Beg. gluteus maximus)
Prone Hip Extension (2:40, Advanced gluteus maximus)
Stretching (14:08, covers all of the previously worked muscles plus IT band and Achilles Tendon)
To do the entire program without the extra diagrams and talking takes just under 32 minutes.  The Stretching segment includes:
Hamstring stretch
Inner thigh stretch
Gluteus maximus and minimus stretch (one stretch for both groups of muscles)
Quad stretch
Hip flexor stretch
Upper calf stretch
Lower calf stretch (Achilles tendon)
IT (illiotibial) stretch
There is also a massage for the IT band that you can access from the ""Bonus Features"" menu.  Don't forget to check out the very short segment under the bonus features menu explaining what ""Proprioception"" is and why it's important to knee strength.  It includes 2 exercises to test and strengthen your proprioception.  I thought my proprioception was great because I used to be a gymnast.  Boy was I humbled to find out that my proprioception was no longer as good as it used to be.  Before I bought this DVD, I was already aware that I had tight hamstrings and calf muscles.  I was very surprised to find out (after doing the DVD) that I also had weak quad & calf muscles as well as tight hip flexors.  All in all, an exceptional video for your knees.  I learned a lot and enjoyed the exercises and stretching!  Best of all, my knees no longer hurt going up stairs or squatting to pick up things from the floor.",1259712000,100,4322,4.822493224932249

3524501,5,B001D261TS,"I hurt my knee towards the end of July after a very quick increase in the frequency, duration, and intensity of my workouts on the elliptical trainer. I had been pretty lazy the past year and was to the point I was only using it on weekends, and then went quite suddenly to 6 days a week.  At that point, the grinding noise I had previously ignored turned into a mix of dull pain around the knee cap, and very, very sharp pain under the left knee cap. I had dislocated this knee cap at the age of 14. My other knee also became tight.

I purchased this DVD with the idea that if my knee did not get better, or got worse, I would go for PT. For the first month I made great progress using this DVD and reduced time on the elliptical trainer. But then while on a Staycation my knee pain increased significantly. Different shoes, more active, etc. So, I went to the doctor. I have two subluxated patellas, the left one being significantly off the track. On top of that I have hip dysplasia  on the right (shallow hip socket), and a SIJ rotation - these were diagnosed initially in 1997.  So, I'm a fairly complex case!

But throughout the 2 weeks for diagnostics, and additional 2 weeks to finally get into PT (and now I'm waiting another 3 weeks to get to the start of the regular weekly sessions) - I have continued to use this DVD. I truly think without it, I would not be walking.

I have only had my first PT session, but what I've done so far is simply building on this DVD.  Concentrating on the gluteus medius, I've added resistance and reps for the clam shell, and holding time and reps for the side leg raises. I've increased the balancing exercises to add additional reps (which has also helped strengthen weak ankles, and a weak arch on my left foot).  And I can't do regular bridges, so now I'm learning to do the single leg bridge on a chair.  I've only had one week of PT, and I've already seen big results, but I've continued to use the exercises and stretches from this DVD as the basis for my work - only changing the exercises to meet my personal needs.

I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone with knee injuries. And also, the stretching routine on the DVD is awesome.

UPDATE December 2009:
I am still in PT for my knee. Progress is being made but is slow, which is not unusual for the knee.  The only portion I still use from the DVD is the stretching sequence and I use it almost daily.  Even though I no longer use the DVD, the exercises I do continue to be based on the same ideas as this DVD, but either the rep count, the hold time, or intensity has been changed.  Besides the items mentioned above, the latest change has been to add weight to the wall slide exercises and maintain a 6-second hold time.  I have to be careful with exercises that target the quads directly as it causes the knee to lock down, but this one seems to be working.

As another reviewer mentioned, I also added ankle weights to the side leg raises, although I had to place them just above the knees. It was amazing how important the gluteus medius exercises were for my recovery. In my modified versions it takes me about 30-35 minutes to do all of my lower body strength exercises, of which 15 minutes is for the gluteus medius!! It's amazing how things all fit together.

As one of the other reviewers mentioned, this is a good DVD for beginners and even light intermediate.  But over time you will likely need to up the workout a little. Either way, I think this is a very good DVD.

I never did use the 7 minute workout as I felt it was too rushed.",1255651200,6,3556,4.2727272727272725
3524502,5,B001D261TS,"I was training to climb Mt. Whitney this August, when I began having a lot of knee pain.  I have had knee problems in the past, so I was concerned that I would not be able to make the climb.  I was considering physical therapy, when a good friend (who happens to be a physical therapist) recommended I save my money and buy this DVD instead.  I am so grateful to her.  Not only did I learn what my problem was (tight hamstrings, weak hip muscles) but I am happy to report I climbed Mt. Whitney pain-free. That's 22 miles roundtrip with an ascent/descent of 6,500 feet with no knee problems!  Considering I had to drop out of the downhill portion of a 5-mile race once because of severe knee pain, that's pretty amazing.

I read one reviewer who felt there was too much time spent on advertising and education.  To that I say, ""fast-forward"".  It's worth it to reap the benefits of this great DVD. Besides, once you do the exercises enough, you know which are the ones that make the biggest difference for you and you can do them without the video.

3524503,5,B001D261TS,"Last year, I was diagnosed with tendonitis and patellofemoral tracking syndrome in my right knee.  My orthopedist referred me to a physical therapist, who had me start on a regimen of both stretching and strengthening exercises.  When I first had these problems, my knee pain was so terrible that I couldn't even walk without feeling excruciating pain.

What I have noticed is that when I do the exercises that my PT gave me, my knee pain recedes and both of my knees feel good.  What I have also discovered, however, is that I get lazy about doing the exercises on my own.  Finding this DVD was a treasure since it contains all of the exercises that my PT gave to me, and contains a thorough explanation of why these stretches and strengthening exercises are important.

Chantal Donnelly makes this program fun to do; she has a pleasant voice and personality, and makes it enjoyable and bearable to do the exercises.  She recommends doing the exercises every other day.

The filming of this video is also quite lovely.  It's set in this beautiful house, with dark wood floors and beautiful brick walls.  While that may not seem important to some, I think it's nice to have a pleasant backdrop since it makes me more likely to do the workout.

While the main workout clocks in at about 35 minutes, you also have the option of customizing the workout so that you can mix and match those segments that interest you.  There are also several nice bonus features:  a seven-minute stretch that I plan on using after my cardio workouts, an IT band stretching segment, and a balance section.

After using this video just one time, I, like other reviewers, can already tell a difference.  My knee pain has been flaring up the last couple of days, but doing this video just one time has made the pain go away.

I also want to address the commercials that one reviewer commented on.  Yes, there are a few at the start of the DVD, but you can use your skip-ahead arrows on your DVD player to jump right past them. There is one short one that you can't skip, but it's maybe 15 seconds long.  All in all, it's not even a slight nuisance for me.

3524505,5,B001D261TS,"I never realized that the cause of bad knees and potential problems with the knees is related to other muscles and tendons of the hips and thighs. I am trying to avoid future problems--as my mom had weak knees and my neighbor is getting surgery to repair hers. I have had indications during exercise of knee weakness and pain and decided not to wait until the problem becomes more serious. This is an excellent video with exercises targeted at strengthening all of the various muscles and tendons that affect the knees. I recommend this DVD for knees as well as the two DVD's by Gary Kraftsow on Viniyoga Therapy for lower back, sacrum and hips and his other DVD that covers upper back, shoulders and neck. That way you have exercises to help the whole body stay flexible and youthful. There is no reason that we cannot incorporate beneficial exercises into our lives that will improve the quality of life. Better that than surgery.",1247875200,6,932,4.689024390243903
3524506,5,B001D261TS,"I very much dislike all the adverts in the beginning of the video. I feel when you pay for a DVD program, you should not be subjected to advertising.

The first part of the program discusses the knees, how they're built and how they work, what can go wrong and how you can deal with pain and even avoid or prevent it.

It's good to watch this section at least one time before you begin working on your knees.

But then it goes right into the 30-minute exercise program without giving you the option to break up your exercises into the 7 minute sections. She does say that you have that option but I didn't see it.

There are exercises for beginners, intermediates and advanced exercises. Even though the program is produced by Gaiam, it is not what I'd call yoga but rather stretching, strengthening exercises. A few of the exercises, however, are yoga poses.

Chantal Donnelly, the instructor, first describes the exercises and the modifications. You'll hear soft, pleasant music that won't overpower. The room where they're exercising is a clean, minimalist room and the colors good and comforting.

She tells you that you can design your own exercise program based on your needs and the time available.

You'll want a soft or semi-firm (not firm) pillow, towel or bolster and a sturdy straight-backed chair and, of course, a mat. You'll also want a dyna band or a strap. A band would probably be best.

Chantal gives good instructions and directions. She has a pleasant personality and a nice, pleasing voice. I was impressed with what she brings to the video and the exercises.

The exercises are frequently interrupted with instructions and information. This could, after a while, become annoying. In the first view, it's a good thing. As one reviewer says, have your remote handy.

The main program lasts over 35 minutes, rather than the thirty.

You have to click on the Bonus Features to get to the 7 minute and Design Your Own Program areas.

All of these exercises will indeed strengthen your knees and help you eliminate pain. I know because I've done them and I suffer from very bad knees. So they've proven themselves to me time and again. The key is to do them! And keep doing them.

Highly recommended.

3524507,5,B001D261TS,"I do kung fu approximately 2 hours/day three times per week, including past running, and been in a car accident that injured my left knee, all contributing to chronic knee pain.  Therefore, I bought this DVD when I was at the Barnes and Noble under the ""Gaiam"" yoga section.  Literally after one day, my knee pain improved considerably and after doing the DVD every day religiously for 2 weeks, I have none to minimal knee pain.

A caveat.  My friend was suffering from severe knee pain and so I sent her the DVD immediately.  She found no relief as she had NO knee cartilage.  Therefore, even steroid injections, pain killers were not effective.  Unfortunately surgery appears to be the last resort.  However, if you DO have some knee cartilage, take chondroiton sulfate (cosamin DS is the doctor recommended brand) and do the DVD, you will have instant pain relief.

As for the criticisms of it being too much information, too many commercials, and threatening men's masculinity and not increasing muscle bulk visibly, here are some counterpoints.

The information I feel is absolutely vital.  Without it, you will become dependent forever on other physical therapists/treatments.  Knowledge is power, and Ms. Donnelly wants you to become independent, the hallmark of hte best teachers.  After watching the entire DVD, I knew IMMEDIATELY what I needed to focus on:  strength in the hip/glute areas and flexibility everywhere (this is because I do weight lifting for the quads, hamstrings and calves at the gym).  Since you know what causes knee pain, and if you know your weaknesses, you can do ONLY the exercises targeting the weaknesses.  Even if you do NOT know what your problem areas are after watching the informational portions, once you do ALL the exercises, if you note any one that is causing any difficulty (and others that are really easy), write down the hard exercises, and concentrate on them, ignore the really easy ones.

Furthermore, there is a menu option that you can pick and chose the exercise, press enter, and Ms. Donnelly will go through only those that you chose, so that you can skip the instructional parts.  After awhile, I knew by heart the exercises I needed to do (I wrote them down as well for reference), so I can bypass the DVD completely, and just do them from memory.  However, I like to do the DVD sometimes as I find the humor refreshing and healing and it's like taking a class that I paid a lot of money for.

There ARE too many annoying commercials, so why not turn on the DVD, do errands, and once the commercials are over, then do your exercises?  When I first started out, first thing in the morning, I turn on the DVD/TV, do my back exercises (the Y's Way to a Healthy Back by Melleby is the only book that helped with back pain for me), and then go through the menu to start the knee exercises.  Again, after 2 weeks or so, I can do this through rote memory, without reliance on the DVD.  I also wrote down all the exercises for reference, and then finally did only the ones that are giving me trouble.

Again, you can save time, by writing down what the exercises you need to do, and refer to that, and never needing the DVD again, becoming truly independent.

As for the criticism that most men will not do this video as it will threaten their masculinity, I feel that all men are NOT that fragile and pathetic, that men are actually sane, and will do the exercises as it will relieve complete pain.  The other complaint of the same reviewer, is that does not build muscles visibly.  However,the goal is to eradicate knee pain, not to be a body builder.  As long as you have adequate strength and flexibility in all areas that are specific to the knee, you will NOT feel pain whatsoever (again, as long as you have some cartilage).

If you want to build muscles, I strongly advise Schwarzenegger's classic bible, ""Modern Encyclopedia of Body Building"".  I revised it (as it was WAY TOO INTENSE FOR ME) to being 15, 12, 10, 8, 6 reps of 2 to 3 sets of each muscle group to failure (any short cuts do NOT work for me) twice a week.  If you follow his book, you cannot fail to gain muscle mass.  I don't even follow him religiously, as it is way too much, but even so, that is the only way I was able to get stronger.  However, for knee pain relief, the DVD works.

The reasons why the DVD is so helpful:

1.  Easy to follow with clear verbal and visual instructions
2.  Ms. Donnelly is very encouraging and positive
3.  Mentioning proper form throughout the movements
4.  Very gentle exercises.
5.  I enjoy the humor (humor has been scientifically documented to reduce pain)
6.  It is meditative
7.  Doesn't take much time at all, but reaping huge benefits.
8.  It is very safe.

I hope that Ms. Donnelly will work on DVDs like this for neck, shoulder, and back pain--I have written to her pleading that she covers these topics in future DVDs, so I'm crossing my fingers.  I will definitely buy all three in a heartbeat!!",1246147200,19,4970,4.566101694915254
3524508,5,B001D261TS,"I would actually give this DVD more than 5 stars. Excellent DVD with valuable instruction. There are a number of important muscles relating to the knee and Chantal has exercises for them.  This made a positive difference with my ITBS which is now better. I will continue using this DVD every few days. This was the best purchase I made. Chantal Donnely is a physical therapist and sharing exercises to keep knees healthy!
I have had this dvd for several years and loved it. Thinking my problems were hamstring, I put this away. Turns out, Chantal's exercises help  strengthen the legs.
Gaiama dvd's are annoying with the commercials. I have been able to fast forward past them to get to the menu. On the bonus section, there is a design your workout where you can select the exercises and don't have to hear all of the valuable information. Her stretching section is very effective. I highly recommend this dvd.",1244851200,3,911,4.723270440251572
3524509,3,B001D261TS,"Strong Knees turned out to be more of an informational video than an exercise video.  Yes, it contained strengthening and stretching exercises, but much of the video was instructional.  Apparently it is part of Gaiam's Body Insight series.

Each muscular group that supports the knees was described, and how weakness in those areas could cause different types of knee pain.  Then, for each group, one beginner and one advanced exercise were performed.  There were not enough repetitions for true strength-training and stronger people may need to add weights.  However, I believe the purpose of the video was to learn the exercises and then put them into your own exercise routine, not to use this video as an exercise program.  I did learn a lot, however, even as an experienced exerciser and dancer.  I did not know that the calves, hip adductors and gluteus muscles could impact the knees, always focusing in the past on quads and hamstrings.  I also learned about alignment during exercises that really made them far more effective.

Some of the exercises were new to me. Others were familiar from my previous experience with boxing training and from dancing (particularly ballet).  So, I will be adding these exercises to my daily practice, either as part of dance practice, or in front of the TV as many of them are compatible with sitting in front of the TV (and don't we all do that sometimes?)

Next, the stretching routine stretched each one of the muscles and explained how tightness in those muscles could also lead to knee pain.  This section felt great.  I was happy that many of the stretches that are part of my current yoga practice are good for my knees.  There is no need to do this special stretch series for me.

The instructor was very intelligent, well-spoken and made sure to cue proper alignment at all times.

The DVD also contains a 7 minute abbreviated workout and a section on IT band massage.

My major problem with the video was the two minutes of required commercials.  I will not do this video again - when I have time to work out, I do not want to spend 2 minutes waiting through commercials.  I don't mind commercials on a DVD but if I do it multiple times, I want to be able to skip them.  Unfortunately, this ""feature"" has become all too common on mass-market fitness DVDs.  Can you imagine if you wanted to do the quick 7 minute workout on this DVD and had to sit through that many commercials?  That is the reason I am degrading the star rating on this product and I hope that Gaiam will sit up and take notice that consumers do not appreciate the commercials.  After all, we just spent 20$ on a DVD, why should we have to watch commercials?  Advertisement for other DVDs should be an optional experience, or one that is included in the paper insert for the product.",1244332800,272,2804,4.627530364372469
3524510,5,B001D261TS,One of my knees was bothering me.  I want to avoid knee surgery so I thought exercises might help.  I learned a lot from the physical therapist who designed the video.  The exercises are not difficult to do and the pay off is great!  I stuck with the every other day plan and know my knee is pain free!  It took 3-4 weeks of persistent exercises but it has been well worth it.,1241740800,8,376,4.095890410958904
3524511,4,B001D261TS,I got a few good tips that make it worth the purchase so I give it four stars for a beginner.  If you listen to what she is telling you while stretching you may improve your technique.  Definitely for beginners and not the work out video I was hoping for.,1236988800,,255,4.08
3524512,5,B001D261TS,"I'm very excited about this dvd... I have been having ""crunchy"" knees for a while now and I have been ignoring it. I was told that I have very tight IT bands (Iliotibial bands) and that's what's causing the pain and the cracking.

I didn't really do much about my knees until, after working out, I heard a really loud pop coming from my knee cap that hurt A LOT... OUCH! The pain was pretty bad and I couldn't lock my knee or walk right... I was afraid I tear a ligament or had something serious. The doctor said that I have an imbalance in my leg muscles and very tight IT bands and that all I needed was physical therapy (2-3 times a week for 6 weeks).

I was glad it wasn't a more serious condition but at the same time I wasn't thrilled about the co-pays for every physical therapy session ($25). I went to PT a few times when I realized I couldn't really spend $450 worth of co-pays. That's when I started searching for cheaper options and found this GREAT and amazing dvd!!!!

To my surprise this dvd had ALL exercises I did in my physical therapy sessions and MORE!!!!!!  I WAS SOOOOO THRILLED about finding this DVD. I quit going to PT and did this dvd exclusively almost every day in the comfort of my own home!!! After 3 weeks I can say that my knees are basically back to normal!!!!! This DVD definitely saved my knees!!!!

Chantal explanations of the knee anatomy is very important to understand why we need to do the exercises. No doctor or therapist explained to me why the exercises were important for my recovery; therefore, I never believed that the exercises would actually cure my knee problems. Now I do believe that these exercises are the way to go, thanks to Chantal!!! She is very knowledable and down to earth. I love doing this DVD with her every day!!!

I usually do the 30 minute routine... if I have more time, I do some of the exersices twice. And if I'm pressed with time, I just do the 7 Minute Save your Knees workout! This option is great!

She also explains how to do IT band massages using a tennis ball... I like this method but I also enjoy doing the massages using a foam roller.

I recommend this DVD 100% if you have pain in your knees. This DVD has helped me tremendously... and the best part, it cost me less than 1 session of physical therapy!!!!

Thanks Chantal for producing such a great DVD!!!!",1235260800,130,2341,4.338672768878719
3524513,5,B001D261TS,"I purchased this video because I was experiencing knee pain when I walked. After watching the introduction, I realized why my knees were bothering me (tight calf muscles.) I noticed that my knees felt better after doing the exercises the very first time. After doing the exercises for 3 days, my knees are almost completely pain free.

The only issue that I have with this video is that the explanatory and the exercise sections are combined. If you don't want to listen to the explanations each time you do the exercises, you need to have your remote handy to fast forward through the talking.

It's also irritating that Gaiam will not allow you to go to the DVD menu immediately and requires that you fast forward through the advertising at the beginning of the DVD.

Overall, the minor irritations are overcome by a very effective set of exercises that really work.",1230422400,75,868,4.735099337748345

8291483,2,B001D261TS,"So, I was beyond angry with all the advertising and what appeared to be no way to move past the ads at the beginning. On first viewing, it wouldn't let me use the ""menu"" option and skip the ads. Then, curious, I checked reviews here and found more than a few people equally as angered. Finding it hard to believe that I was really going to be forced to watch this every time I wanted to follow the exercises, I then removed the DVD and re-inserted it. I was then able to use the menu and skip to play, which started with the exercises. Maybe I did something different the second time? Seems too sophisticated that it would only be blocked at first use. Hmmm...?

As others have said, this is a decent demonstration of the exercises video. But, honestly, having to spend even a moment monkeying around to get to the exercises and the general insult of all the ads when I've paid for the DVD...? Check YouTube or try one of the DVDs that others have indicated might be a good option. The exercises might be good, but I can't in good conscience recommend that anyone spend money on a Gaiam product.",1494806400,,1095,4.367647058823529

I am middle-aged and only weigh 130 pounds.  My knee x-rays are normal.  I have weak knees.  Read, ""treat your own knees"" by Jim Johnson.  His exercises are designed to minimize any stress on the knee joint so they focus on building up the knee without using it and stressing it.
