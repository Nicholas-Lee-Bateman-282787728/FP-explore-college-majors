You could compare it to trying to watch a movie in a theater while the person behind you continuously makes jokes about the show. Do not buy this unless you absolutely can't find another hustle video.  I'm sending mine back. What could have been a good instructional video is actually painful to watch. Very unprofessional.",1152057600,2,455,4.896103896103896
7927793,4,B00004YZO2,"The previous reviews helped me decide to purchase the video.  I am slow at any dance classes and I need to repeat and practice before I can feel comfortable in leading steps.  I have wanted to learn the hustle for about 6 months bud did not have time to take any lessons.  This tape enabled me to learn the moves and practice the leads.  It is very helpful for me.  Again, my sincere thanks to those previous reviewers.",1136764800,,419,4.32051282051282
7927794,5,B00004YZO2,Pleasant-looking professional instructors teach you with fun and flair. Enough to make you a good intermediate level dancer on the floor. I won't be looking for another instructional video for a while. Recommended!,1069027200,5,214,5.515151515151516
