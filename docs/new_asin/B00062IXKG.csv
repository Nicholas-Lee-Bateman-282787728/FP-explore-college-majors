8067387,3,B00062IXKG,"This is a decent video if all your looking for is the absolute basics of telescopes and binoculars.  The title, to me, is misleading.  it isn't ""ALL ABOUT..."" or even close to being that. This isn't to say this video doesn't have value, it does.  It does review different types of telescopes, but not much on how to use them. It does cover a number of different areas such as ""seeing"", filters, mounts, etc, however it goes into very little detail. In some cases it doesn't go any further than to say you can do a particular thing.  If you're looking for a video on telescopes and binoculars, just keep in mind this is a very basic one.  You will find MUCH more information from the many books that are available on this same topic.",1185667200,3,732,4.392592592592592
