2252030,2,B0007YRXMM,"I am an avid Tae Bo fan and was looking for something just to break up my routine and after seeing the reviews for this dvd I can't believe I spent my money on it.

Through the entire warm up I felt like I was doing ballet. It was wayyyyy too easy and boring and whereas yes I would recommend it to someone who is a beginner,I honestly hated it. My two year old could do this in her sleep.",1145145600,11,389,3.8625
2252031,5,B0007YRXMM,"This is a fantastic and tough kickbox inspired workout.  Wow it will have you sweating.  Cathe is one of the best cuers out there and so you know ahead of time what's next.  You need good instruction here because you are so busy huffing and puffing and sweating, you don't want to have to worry about your next move before you need to.  It's one of the most challenging kickbox workouts I've ever done.

It's broken up into three segments.  You can either choose one only or two or if you are in the mood for some tough 'punishment' then you can do all three together for the most effective workout.  It's about 75 minutes all up, and let me say - this ain't for the faint of heart.  Do not make the mistake of thinking you can get through this if you are new to exercising.  Even for more advanced exercisers, you'll find this tough - but in a good way.",1143244800,16,854,4.222222222222222
2252032,3,B0007YRXMM,"I bought this video with high expectations after reading all the glowing reviews.  I was really disappointed.  The video is well-made and great for the beginning exerciser, but I did not find it challenging at all and hardly broke a sweat except briefly during the bootcamp segment.  I usually workout with either Billy Blanks' Get Ripped Advanced Tae Bo series or by taking kickboxing classes at the gym.  Compared to these, this video simply doesn't cut it and is much too slow-paced for the advanced level exerciser.",1142899200,9,519,4.931034482758621
2252033,5,B0007YRXMM,"I have been doing aerobics and kickboxing for years and have been disapointed by tapes and DVDs that are too dance-y or so basic that I never break a sweat.  This one went beyond my expectations-it is easy to follow, high intensity, challenging (but not due to tricky moves) and it absolutely will make you sweat!",1140134400,,313,4.589285714285714
2252034,5,B0007YRXMM,"I so love this dvd! It's a great, challenging workout.

Simply put, Cathe is the best of the best! I wish there was the choice to just have vocals & no music. She did that on some of her older DVD's, so you don't have to get sick of the same songs.",1122508800,7,248,3.769230769230769
2252035,5,B0007YRXMM,"Finally, I was able to try one of Cathe Friedrich's new DVDs.  Her ""Low Max"" workout is intense, but fun.  I really enjoyed it and burned a TON of calories in the process.

This workout is mostly a low impact step routine with intervals of floor toning, but it isn't easy by any means.  I don't recommend it for beginners or anyone with two left feet!  The music is great, but the fast tempo and intense pace will frustrate those new to step aerobics.  Cathe mixes a few dance moves, like the mambo and the chacha, so the choreography may require some amount of practice.  Still, if you're up for the challenge and looking to workup a SERIOUS sweat, this DVD is for you.  :-)

I plan to order more DVDs from Cathe in the future.  She does a good job of cueing and looks great!

Wow scale:  9 (out of 10)

Difficulty:  Advanced

Studio setting:  A bit boring, but current for the times",1112745600,27,884,4.298780487804878

2252075,5,B0007YRXMM,This step workout is low impact and high intensity with easy-to-follow choreography. Cathe Friedrich is an excellent instructor; this is the second Cathe Friedrich step aerobics DVD that I have purchased.,1420675200,,204,5.612903225806452
2252076,5,B0007YRXMM,I love this workout.  I do this one when my joints are too sore from high intensity workouts.  It is great and you are feeling it by the end.,1418083200,,141,3.8275862068965516

2252078,5,B0007YRXMM,This is one of my best tapes.  If you want a work out it that you can see result kept using  Cathie tapes,1401494400,,105,3.5217391304347827

2252080,4,B0007YRXMM,Cathe has the kind of body that inspires me to push and get a good workout.  This one makes you work hard.,1394064000,,106,3.8181818181818183
2252081,5,B0007YRXMM,"Great workout if you are looking for a good challenge that gets you sweating. I really liked Cathe's style, she is motivational but not overbearing.",1392940800,,148,4.96
2252102,5,B0007YRXMM,I love Cathe Friedrich and this is a calorie fat burner. It is intense and you sweat so much it is crazy.,1392508800,,105,3.8181818181818183
2252103,5,B0007YRXMM,"I'm a huge fan of Cathe Freidrich programs and I have 5 of her other DVDS so I knew this one would not disappoint. This routine has seven low impact routines done mostly on the step but has some kickboxing moves as well (which I really liked) and seven intensity blasts mixed in with the step moves to bring the heart rate up even more. I'm familiar with most of the steps but there were a few new ones which seemed complex at first but Cathe always explains them so well and repeats them until they make sense. This DVD is 69 minutes long. I got through about 45 minutes of it the first time around on a 6"" step and had to do the rest of the session without the step. It was a great workout. I can't wait to do this again and again and try to get through the whole routine on the step. Highly recommended for anyone who wants low impact in a heart pumping workout.",1388880000,,865,4.094117647058823
2252104,4,B0007YRXMM,Awesome intro. Room to build up. I purchased weighted gloves to accompany this work out. Definitely a good leg work out as well as shoulder.,1385856000,,140,4.64
2252105,3,B0007YRXMM,"I was excited to get this DVD as I have been stepping since the 1990s. I wanted a new DVD to add to my collection of step videos. I thought that I knew the moves and terminology well enough to follow the choreography on this DVD, but I was wrong.  The things I like about this work-out include Cathe's enthusiasm and the music, which is a step above (no pun intended) most other step work-out DVDs.  I like the premixes and the ability to choose a portion of the work-out instead of doing the entire thing. I also like the intensity segments because these are easy to follow. For example, one intensity segment involves lunges done with one foot on the step, with high reps, for about three minutes. The intensity blasts are harder to do, but easier to follow, than the step routine. I found it very difficult to do the step moves, even on the second and third try. Like other reviewers, I gave up and started over, but still could not follow the steps. Especially challenging for me were the backwards mambas and over-the-step moves. There are LOTS of twists and turns in the routine that I found confusing. The cueing is good, but the moves are not explained well enough for me, and sometimes are not put together in segments, but rather just appear. In contrast, I like Gin Miller and Gilad step videos, which provide a challenging work-out without the complicated moves, and also provide a nice build-up to a segment containing multiple moves. On balance, some positives and great potential, but this is not likely to be a DVD that becomes part of my weekly routine.",1376352000,3,1570,4.5638297872340425
2252106,5,B0007YRXMM,"I loved this dvd!!!!!! The steps were easy to follow, however, it is quite a workout, don't let the low max part fool you.",1374883200,,122,4.125
2252107,5,B0007YRXMM,"This is a great workout!!  She was right about the ""low Max""  It's low impact but your intensity is pushed to the maximum levels!! The step combos are very simple and short, but the blast segments are ruthless!!!  I sweat like crazy, and am EXHAUSTED by the end of this workout!! It's a little over an hour.",1373500800,,307,4.350877192982456
2252108,5,B0007YRXMM,great workout. she is good at explaining and showing the moves. I am in good shape and feel great after!,1366934400,,104,4.25
2252109,5,B0007YRXMM,"Loved this video. It is a hardcore workout, especially the cardio blasts, but it works a ton of muscles and will have you doing things you never knew you could do.

The punching/kicking combinations are a sensational, and the slower paced leg conditioning exercises that she finishes the DVD with are just what the doctor ordered after all high activity before.

Have fun, kick, punch, jump! The sky is the limit. No equipment needed, just bring yourself.",1365465600,,455,4.896103896103896
2252110,4,B0007YRXMM,"Not sure if it's just me...but I love kickboxing!  This video not only has chapters you can play, but also mix & matches.  This is so well worth the money!",1364515200,,155,4.133333333333334
2252111,4,B0007YRXMM,"Great workout! I would have given it a 5 star if it had an ab workout included before the end stretch and also a workout using the bag. Otherwise, bravo!",1361059200,,153,4.133333333333334
2252142,2,B0007YRXMM,I bought this video thinking I was going to get a good workout. My heart rate did go higher but that was just because I was trying to keep up with Cathe. The workout has to many steps to try to keep up with. By the time you get one step down she adds another and I would fall behind again. Even if I watched it all the way through I wouldn't be able follow along. I wanted basic steps to work on certain areas not the stumbling along I do with this dvd.,1360972800,,453,3.8297872340425534
2252143,4,B0007YRXMM,"This is a good workout if you want to combine cardio, kickboxing with lower body core work. It's nice because 45 minutes is the cardio/kickboxing and the remaining 30 minutes is the lower body core work. It's nice to have the option of doing the workout in its entirety or just choosing the kickboxing work. I find it challenging (intermediate). Nice if you want to supplement your regimen with higher intensity workouts.",1356739200,,421,4.861111111111111
2252144,5,B0007YRXMM,"I absolutely love this workout!  I've been working out at the gym and at home since the early 1990's on a regular basis, but about a year ago when I developed sciatic pain from sitting at work and periformis syndrome from running everyday, I realized that I needed to change my excercises and focus on hitting all of the muscle groups I was missing from running.  So, I left the treadmill and purchased some Cathe Friedrich DVD's.  I must say that this is the best kick boxing aerobic/plyometric workout I've ever done!  I'm 45 years old and in good shape, but in inspite of that, I still cannot finish all of the reps of several of the exercises on the Kick Max DVD, especially in the leg work section! Everytime I do this workout, I am sore for the next 2 - 3 days!  Kick Max kicks my butt everytime I do it!  Not only is is an awesome workout, it's also a lot of fun. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a hardcore and challenging workout, especially if you enjoy plymetrics, martial arts, and sweating alot!",1355270400,,1021,4.347368421052631
2252145,5,B0007YRXMM,Once again Cathe at her best! This dvd is a must have if you are a step fan. Your thighs will love you and hate you at the same time :-). Be warned.. this workout is a long one (a little over an hour with the cool down and the stretch). It's low impact but HIGH intensity. For me.. this is a must-do at least once a week.,1352937600,,321,3.735294117647059
2252146,3,B0007YRXMM,"If I live to step to 100, I will never understand the concept of turning one's back on the step.  They have a nasty habit of moving around by themselves while you are not watching.  Boo!  Back when I used to attend step classes in the gym, this is the kind of workout that sent women tumbling to the ground.  I would have walked out of this class.  Cathe gets three stars for the customizable options on this dvd and for the fact that I did get a good sweat.",1344988800,,458,4.044444444444444
2252147,5,B0007YRXMM,"I'll start by saying that I'm not a hugely athletic person.  I've been on a weight loss journey for the last 3 or 4 years and to date have lost about 50lbs.  That was two steps forward, one and a half steps back at times.  I'm in the best shape of my life to date, but I can still be out-biked, out-marathoned, or out kick-boxed by many, many people.  So don't let the advanced sound of this DVD run you off.

I received my DVD in the mail this morning and tried out the 58min. premix program this afternoon.  The kickboxing routines were awesome, but the coordination first time through was a bit challenging (think your first step aerobics class).  I'm sure I'll improve and look more graceful as I go on.  I must say that the Leg Conditioning Drills were REALLY excruciatingly good for me!  I found out that my legs need a lot of work on flexibility!  I never really found myself breathless (ie. oh-my-god-this-must-be-good-for-me-because-I'm-about-to-pass-out), but according to my heart rate monitor I was in the target zone the whole time and I burned 426 calories in that one hour.  This is a great DVD for adding into a workout schedule and don't let those easy looking leg conditioning drills fool you!",1344816000,3,1211,4.61214953271028
2252148,5,B0007YRXMM,"I am a big fan of any Cathy Friedrich's DVD and this one is no exception. I own it for 2 years and still enjoy it. Keep in mind it is very intense. I am in mid 40's and been doing it every now and then since I was in my 20's and regularly 3-5 times a week for the last 2 years (not just this one, I have a pretty good collection by now)and this one still is a challenge for me. Usually I do half of it. And there is another thing I like about this DVD: it has premixes so you can do just the part of the program you like. On this DVD the premixes are particularly good. And of cause, if it is still too hard for you, just lower your step. Cathy workouts are always fun.",1312934400,,669,3.7183098591549295
2252149,5,B0007YRXMM,"Can't believe I haven't reviewed Low Max yet.  I love this dvd.  I've done it dozens of times since 2007 when I bought it.  It's just like the Imax dvds except you're not bouncing all over the place, giving your weary hip flexors, hips and knees a nice break from all the other crap you do.  That said, don't think it's easy.  The blasts get you anaerobic by attacking your legs with a series of varied lunges, squats, etc.

That said, it is true that this is not one of her hardest dvds.  When you're an advanced exerciser, low impact cardio is not going to get you very out of breath.  However, you don't mind because you're still breathing hard from all the zillion lunges you just did and your legs are like jelly anyways.  The step segments are pretty short, and the blasts seem to be longer, so it all adds up to a very high end medium intensity workout which tires your legs very effectively.",1302825600,,899,4.335329341317365
2252150,3,B0007YRXMM,"I struggled with the proper rating for this, as it's definitely not for me, but I could see it providing an excellent workout for someone else. I am very well coordinated, and have no trouble picking up ""dancey"" choreography in other dvds. However, I have only taken a couple of step classes and know only the more basic terminology so I knew this would be a challenge. I decided therefore to try the workout just on the floor first, without a step. Well, I stuck it out through the first 5 sections (of 14: 7 step combos & 7 blasts) but then had to turn it off and couldn't continue.

This is for those who REALLY know step terminology and are advanced in this type of workout. I may know my V-steps, Over the Tops, Repeaters and Straddle Downs, but they did not help me much here. I could not follow her footwork, and it didn't help that much of it was done facing away from the TV. Because she added a ton of variety to her steps and lots of directional changes I also struggled with mirroring her image and ending up on the right foot or on the right corner of the step (which remember, for me was just an imaginary rectangle on the ground, making it twice as bad). Like I said before, I am VERY coordinated and have no trouble picking up advanced dance based workouts, but this is a whole different ballgame. I didn't think Cathe's cuing particularly helped either... she often cues as a move is beginning and she doesn't preview a move before going into it. I've never had to stop a workout dvd before and not finish it, but I barely got 15 minutes in to this before I knew I would just be stumbling around the whole time if I continued.

All of that having been said, I still think this could be a GREAT dvd if you're really advanced with step choreography. To be fair, I did not complete the workout, or view it in its entirety, but I believe I saw enough to make this judgment. She offers a ton of variety and what I thought was unique choreography. The workout alternates between step routines and strengthening ""blasts"". And yes, it is low impact but it is definitely high intensity, which is a rare combination in workout dvds. Even just stumbling around I worked up a sweat and the blasts fatigue your muscles if done as intended. I'd definitely recommend this to an advanced stepper.

I realize that I could have gone back through the process of rewinding, watching, trying, repeat, and slowly worked at the routines and maybe then it would have been more doable but I like to at least be able to stumble along on the first go-around, feeling like I was mostly able to keep up, if not catch everything, but that wasn't possible for me here. And to be honest, she moved so quickly it probably would have been difficult to follow along even if I had taken this re-watching approach. It would have been nice if the dvd included a slow break-down of some of the more advanced moves as an extra.

In a nutshell, if you're very comfortable with step choreography I'd give this a try for an advanced low impact workout. However, if you don't have a good knowledge of step terminology I'd definitely start with something more basic.",1302134400,5,3138,4.423875432525952
2252151,5,B0007YRXMM,"This is my favorite Cathe Kickboxing DVD.  I like the different sections, e.g. kickboxing routines, high impact drills, leg conditioning and a stretch.

What I enjoyed about this DVD:

**the strong beat of the music helped me put more intensity into my punching and kicking.

**the uncluttered set and minimal background exercisers. Jai and Lorraine join Cathe for this workout.  I love watching them both; they are very fit and have meticulous kickboxing form.

**the variety. It's nice to have 30 minutes of kickboxing, 15 minutes of high intensity drills, 15 minutes of leg conditioning and a stretch.  I can get tired of kickboxing, but I don't with this variety.

**it's intense!  I know several other reviewers said they didn't find it intense enough and I usually agree that Cathe's kickboxing workouts aren't that intense.  But there is something about this workout; I use one pound weighted gloves to up the intensity.

I recommend this DVD to anyone wanting a fun and challenging Cathe kickboxing workout.",1293408000,2,1015,5.054216867469879
2252182,3,B0007YRXMM,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

Cathe as an instructor is alright for me, neither love nor hate.

My number one thought through this workout is:  Why did they title this kick max?  They probably had the least focus on kicks.

Secondly, they should have titled this jump max with all the jumping jacks, jump rope, jump in place you do.

Overall, I found the kickbox combo sections awful.  For me, the moves were messy and awkward and I barely broke a sweat.  Hardly any cuing but you can pick up the basic punches and kicks since the combos are repeated quite a lot.

The plyo/cardio segement was HARD and high impact.  Jump, jump, jump.  This is my second Cathe workout and I notice you probably need to double up on your sport bras for Cathe's workouts (I say this with a very modest bra size.)  I think Cathe is really in her element with this style and cuing and moves flowed much smoother.  Not a huge fan of high impact, tho.

At this point, I was ready to donate this workout, but then came the kick drills with the chair.  Excellent burn and good for working on form.  Keeping this DVD on the strength of the kick drills segment.  I can use the plyo/cardio + kick drills as a workout and skip the kickbox segments.",1288224000,7,1245,4.366812227074236
2252183,5,B0007YRXMM,"I'm usually leary of workouts that claim to be low impact and advanced.  Well, Low Max fits the bill perfectly!  This is one of my very favorite workouts from Cathe. That's saying a lot since I own every single workout she's ever made.

This workout consists of 7 low impact step routines.  Each step routine is followed by an intensity blast, that is also low impact.  Cathe breaks down each routine and then does the whole routine 2 times on each side.  Cathe uses an 8 inch step.

What I love about this workout:

**it's intense and really gets my heart rate up there.  And this is all without any impact on my joints - yay!

**it's fun.  Cathe is her usual energetic and encouraging self.  You feel like she is in the room with you.

**catchy music that makes you want to workout.  I don't like the music in Cathe's later workouts, so listening to this music is a treat.

When I'm feeling extra energetic, I make this workout even tougher by including leg exercises after each intensity blast.  Ouch!  This takes me about 90 minutes to do and I feel so pumped and really worked out afterwards.

I didn't think the routines were that complex, but then again I'm very used to Cathe's style and cuing.  If the routines are confusing, I suggest watching the DVD once through to get a feel for them.

I highly recommend this workout for those wanting a fun, intense yet low impact workout.",1280448000,,1388,4.4541832669322705
2252184,5,B0007YRXMM,"This is definitely low impact which is what I was looking for but NOT easy by any means!

I've had this for a couple of months now and have been doing the warm-up and step routines only (not the blasts between each step routine); I love that you can tailor your workout this way from the menu.

It took me a while to learn the routines; lots of stop/rewinding/slow motion, etc but once I got it I really enjoyed it.  The music is fun and she's a good instructor; she's beautiful and has a great figure--very inspiring!!  I used to take step classes about 15 years ago so it had been a while; many of these steps were new to me.

Some of the step routines I like better than others but overall it's a fun workout and challenging; I do like the variety of each routine and I never feel bored with lots of repetitive moves.  I think the final step routine is the most challenging so I almost wish it was more toward the beginning, when I have more energy.

I'm glad I bought this and will be looking for others to throw into the rotation so I don't get bored with this one.",1278720000,,1070,4.165048543689321
2252185,5,B0007YRXMM,"This is a fun and challenging DVD. It is pretty long if you do the whole thing, which I have yet to do. There is an option on the menu where you can do the first half or second half of the DVD, which I LOVE because even then I'm still working out for 45 minutes. The footwork is just enough to make you think, but still fun.",1278028800,,324,3.7794117647058822
2252186,5,B0007YRXMM,"I like this one. The combos are not that difficult and she gives you a really good warm up.  The blast challenge is the tough part.  If you are not in shape it will kick your butt!  But I could definately see improvement when I stuck to it.  I personally prefer more kickbox combos but the blast challenge is kickbox based move drills that are pretty intense, you definately don't stop moving!  The leg conditioning drills at the end are really good too.  Overall a great workout.",1272931200,,480,4.459770114942529
2252187,1,B0007YRXMM,"I read reviews here and elsewhere that this is one of the toughest kickboxing workouts.  I love Cathe Friedrich and have several of her workout DVD's, and Circuit Max is one of my favorites.  I thought for sure I'd love this one: I love Cathe, and I adore kickboxing!

This workout is dull and repetitive.  Instead of combos and cardio moves, it is mostly standing in place doing the same sequence over and over: jab, cross, uppercut, then a kick or two, but nothing that is challenging or raised my heart rate.

Thirty minutes into the workout, I had just started to break a sweat.  I kept waiting for the intensity I expected, and during a short section of Bursts, it did pick up, but only briefly.  Just as I started to sweat, it was time to take it way back down and do the leg drills, which again was standing in one place and repeating one move over and over.

I am very disappointed in this workout.  It's far from a cardio workout, and I am not sure how anyone thinks it's tough.  I work out most days of the week but am no super-athlete, so much as I'd like to think it's because I'm so super-conditioned, I doubt that is it!

The Blasts were incredibly challenging and intense, but they went fast (about 15 minutes I think).  The combos are mostly upper body and not as intense but very fast and fun.  The choreography may be challenging for some, but I was able to pick it up after watching just a few the first time.  I think it gives the video more variety.  My legs were on fire for days!  On another day I did the leg conditioning drills...these are slow paced but very effective...your legs burn the whole time while you're doing them.  These also are practice for different kicks in kickboxing.  I consider myself to be at an intermediate/advanced level and I love this workout.",1247875200,,764,4.518248175182482

2252228,5,B0007YRXMM,"I love all Cathe's workouts.  She's tough, but its worth it.  You really break a sweat.",1232236800,,87,4.375
2252229,4,B0007YRXMM,"Before I say anything, I just want to commend Cathe for creating a fun and challenging step workout.  This workout is for the intermediate or advanced stepper who is serious about getting an intense workout.  You definitely have to know the basic steps and I would suggest watching the DVD at least once before attempting it and not to use risers under your step while you learn the routine.  The routine keeps moving and you never have a chance to get bored (which is my main complaint with my step classes at my local fitness center).  As you master the DVD, you can raise the level of your step to make it harder.  This is a DVD that will keep you coming back for more since it is so fun to do.  If you do the entire workout (which I did for the first time yesterday), you will feel exhausted, but great.  This is such a wonderful DVD!

PROS:  This is an intense workout that will work all muscles in your lower body as well as give you an intense cardio workout.  There are three options for shorter workouts (Step Combos 1-4 with the blasts, Step Combos 4-7 with the blasts and Step Combos 1-7 without the blasts).  The last option is great for days that you want to skip most of the toning or have a little less energy because the blasts are intense).

CONS:  The cueing could use some work.  I am used to instructors like Kari Anderson and Keli Roberts who have excellent cueing).  A lot of times, she cues as the move is beginning or doesn't cue.  This is fine later on when you are really familiar with the routine, but could cause a lot of problems the first few times through.  She also does not preview a move before doing it.  She will cue as you go through and not give you a general idea of what is coming.  Again, this is OK once you are familiar with the routine.  If you do the last two options of the DVD, there is a cooldown, but the first option goes directly from a really intense blast to stretching.  You need to make sure your heart rate is down before you stretch since you lower your head almost immediately.  If you are doing the first option (segments 1-4), I would just play the entire DVD and then forward to the cooldown.  It is a pain in the butt, but it is worth it.  Of course, you could always cool down on your own.  I think it must have been an oversight to leave this out on the first option because she is a serious fitness professional.

The cons I listed are the reason I only gave this DVD 4 stars.  If those were corrected, it would definitely be a 5 star workout.  Since this is the first DVD of hers that I have tried, I am not sure if these are systemic problems of hers or just problems with this particular DVD.

As a mom with two young children and only 45 minutes to work out daily, this DVD is great because I have three separate workouts I can do.  You will never get bored with this DVD though since it moves so quickly.  I will definitely purchase more DVD's by Cathe!",1232150400,2,2923,4.212612612612612
2252230,5,B0007YRXMM,"I really enjoy doing this workout. It's fun and easy on my knees. But that does not mean it's an easy workout! Cathe does a great job of keeping this low impact but at a high intensity. Fun, fun, fun. (and effective!)",1225843200,2,217,4.190476190476191

I had expected something more advanced and challenging after reading some of the other reviews so I was a little disappointed, but not through any fault of Cathe.  The kickboxing combos are mainly arm based, easy to follow, but could be more intense and get your heart rate up a .  I will probably switch to weighted gloves to get a better workout.  The cardio blasts definitely get your heart rate up, but are only a small segment of the workout.  The standing leg work is great for toning and strengthening.  I will add this workout to my regular routine.  It is a good all round workout, but if you are looking for more of a straight intense cardio workout I would research other options.",1206403200,6,731,4.534351145038168

If you've been working out for awhile and want to take your program to the next level, Cathe's workouts are a good place to start.  Lo Max is fantastic, getting right to the heart of every woman's trouble zone: hips, thighs, buttocks, etc - And she's not messing around!  Increasing the Step height to 8 inches is a bonus, but do this within reason.  If you're new to Step, or have knee issues (or if you step frequently during the week), I highly suggest you take Cathe's advice that ""any Step height that keeps you in your target zone is perfectly fine"" - and use a height comfortable for you.  Now, as to the workout...  It's a series of increasingly challenging cardio and ""blast"" segments with exercises designed to target the areas above, and it is great fun (you will not notice the passage of time), with just the right level of choreography.  The mix-n-match option is great if you're short on time, or want to vary the work out a bit.  I will definitely try other Cathe DVDs, and highly recommend this one.",1201132800,8,1123,4.497536945812808

Almost all Cathe's workout choreography are complex, so you will have to do many times to catch on before you can do it with just listening to her cue and not looking at the TV.

2252292,4,B0007YRXMM,"I got my first Cathe DVD's (Basic step/Body Fusion, Low Impact step; Total Body Sculpting; Total Body Stretching) in a Step kit I purchased and I fell in love with them.  After a month or so of doing these, I decided I was ready for more of a challenge and looked for a more advanced Cathe DVD.  Based on the reviews, I decided to go with Low Max.

I have to say I was a bit disappointed when I first tried Low Max--the choreography was very hard for me to learn at first and the step segments seemed much too short.  Just as I was getting into a step routine and beginning to work up a sweat, it would end and she would move to a blast. I also felt like I wasn't getting as intense of a workout as I had been getting with Body Fusion, although I wasn't able to raise my step beyond 6"" as I didn't have extra risers.  Perhaps that would have helped increase the intensity.

I have since purchased Body Max 2 and found it to be much more along the lines of what I was looking for--longer more intense step routines, lots more premix options, etc.  With that said, I still like Low Max and think it's an awesome DVD that gives me a good workout.  It's just not my favorite Cathe DVD so far.",1189814400,,1188,4.0905172413793105

It's a great addition to the twenty or so workouts I already own of Cathe Friedrich.",1187827200,,386,4.025974025974026
2252295,3,B0007YRXMM,"If you want a fun, intense, interesting workout this isn't for you.  The choreography was definitely lacking.  After doing it twice I felt like I had done the workout a hundred times.  The kickbox sequence hardly got my heartrate up and the 'blast' was too much jumping, which was hard on the joints (and, I'm only 23), boring and repetitive.

However, this is the only workout I've tried of hers, so I gave it an average grade of three stars in hopes that her other workouts might be better.

2252328,5,B0007YRXMM,"I have been boxing training (in a gym with a personal trainer/former professional boxer and at home with dvds) for years, and before I did this workout for the first time, I had been working out for a year consistently with the Janis Saffell and Guillermo Gomez dvd ""Hardcore Kickbox Circuit.""  After a year of doing that challenging workout, I wasn't sweating with it as much, and needed a new challenge to keep advancing my fitness.  I ordered this dvd looking for a greater challenge, and wow did I get it!

I tried to do Cathe's workout from start to finish (75 minutes), and found I couldn't even come close to doing all of the reps and exercises (particularly the plyometric ""blasts"" and the ""bootcamp challenge"" toning exercises).  This workout definitely is a challenge for the intermediate to advanced exerciser, and those few who reviewed the dvd as ""too easy"" must be professional hardbodies because otherwise I cannot believe their reviews are accurate even for them (or they stopped working out after the warm-up).  Now, after having worked out with this dvd consistently for a couple of weeks, I can complete two of my favorite ""Premixes"" (a great feature of this dvd): the 48 minute ""Timesaver"" and the 50 minute ""Kickbox Bootcamp Challenge.""  I still have not completed every rep of the 75 minute full video from start to finish, and look forward to doing so.

Bottom line:  this is a hard workout that will grow with you, and you will sweat a lot while your heart and breathing rate go way up (particularly during the plyometric sections).  Cathe makes the workout fun (she reminds you to ""get your game face on"" and she means it!) without being overly cute about it.  I can also say, having worked with a professional boxing trainer, Cathe's punch technique is spot-on and fierce, and a good tool for those who want to continue to hone their punching technique while they become more fit.

I love that the DVD has several ""premixes"" so you can choose to do just the step aerobic segments, just the power blasts, or two shortened versions of the aerobics & blasts combined when short on time (or less motivated.)  The choreography is a little tricky, but if you are familiar with other Cathe videos you can pick it up pretty quickly.  Unlike Imax 3, you get a chance to practice the moves a bit before you combine everything together- good for those days when I'm a little less graceful, shall we say.

8054168,5,B0007YRXMM,I just pulled this DVD out from storage and I forgot what a great home work-out this is.  Full body challenging work-out.  I keep track of steps and had 4000 during this work-out.,1486252800,,179,4.393939393939394
8054169,2,B0007YRXMM,"I am an advanced stepper and a huge Cathe fan.  I normally love the challenge of hard choreography and usually pick it up faster than most people normally would, but this one is even too hard for me.  There is no rewinding it and watching it over and over again hoping you'll eventually get it, because you won't.  It goes by too quickly to figure it out.",1481328000,,355,4.268656716417911
8054170,1,B0007YRXMM,"I haven't even bothered to do this DVD.  I watched about 20 minutes of it when I received it.  It seems very basic, and more for beginners.  I work out 6-7 days a week and was expecting an intense workout.  This wasn't it.  Don't waste your money on this if you exercise regularly, You'll likely barely break a sweat.",1453248000,,317,4.305084745762712

8054173,5,B0007YRXMM,"Best kickboxing workout I have found! She makes Jillian Michaels' DVD seem like a warm up! I love that you can jump around on the DVD to do just parts of the workout, or the entire 75 minutes. She is a good instructor. She teaches you the basic move, and then you build on that to make a challenging combo. It was doable even for the uncoordinated like myself.",1449360000,6,360,4.231884057971015
8054174,5,B0007YRXMM,"Cathe Friedrich is the real deal - I love the workout momentum and gosh, do I sweat!  I also love the fact that the workout is over an hour in length as most workout videos in the market are only about 40 minutes.  I've only started this workout so I'm not in syn with Cathe, Lorraine and Jaishree yet but I know I'll get there!  Delivery of this DVD was on time, thanks Amazon!",1438300800,2,378,4.081081081081081
