8171253,3,B000MRB5LE,"This is the first sequel to Paul Naschy's FRANKENSTEIN'S BLOODY TERROR (aka MARK OF THE MAN WOLF).  NASCHY is back as werewolf Waldemar Daninsky, a role he would go on to play in dezens of sequels,prequels and alternate universe spin off films. Along for the ride are a Dracula type Vampire
who looks like Mario Lanza ( some say he looks like Charles Aznovour, but I disagree), a living Mummy and a Frankenstein monster type creature called the Faranksalan
Monster. (Sometimes mistakenly called the ""Franken-science"" monster in press releases.) Its a monster bash
inspired by House of Frankensten etc. The monster names were changed because the producers feared legal reprisals from Universal, even though the Frankenstein and Dracula names have long been in the public domain.  Michael Rennie plays an alien from planet Umo . Obviously inspired by his Klaatu character in Day the Earth Stood Still.though his voice is dubbed by a generic euro type.
The plot is a major comedown from the excellent previous film. Aliens from space are going to terrorize
the earth with these gothic monsters. Kids used to dig this movie, probably because of its high monster count.
Even Universal never added the Mummy to its monster rally films. This one has Wolfman, Dracula, Frankenstein, Mummy, other vampires and some extra terrestrials. So you certainly won't get bored, but you will probably laugh whenever one of the monsters psudonyms is uttered. Its surprising they didn't throw in Mr. Hyde
, a zombie or a gill man type. The monsters make-ups are pretty bad, at least on Frankie, who has thick black fabric fur eyebrows that make him resemble Sesame Streets Burt.
the poster on the DVD cover shows Karloff's Mummy and Frankenstein and Christopher Lee as Dracula.
Dont be taken in by this.  ItS reall;y abad movie but you can enjoy it on a JC's haunted house kind of level.
Dumb fun. But Gothic horror and Science fiction really don't mix. Incidently, despite the second title, Dracula and Frankie never battle, Wolfman gets most of the action.

About the DVD: Its just a blue DVD-R. The image ha been taken from a frence video version source. The original source had been cropped and the image squeezed to slightly animorphic to create a full screen video.
For this dvd they unsqueezed the image to create a wider image and letterboxed it. But it is not the full widescreen seen in other video releases like Frankensteins Bloody Terror. The picture quallity is good, the colors bright and there are no splices.  Te title card (which originally read DRACULA VS. FRANKENSTEIN has been covered over with a black field containing an electronically generated new one reading ""Assignment Terror"". It is a censored version, as several nude females ( a shower scene and a shot of a sleeping woman having her top pulled down) have been removed. In this respect it is superior to the other commercially avaiable version of this film, titled Dracula vs. Frankenstein.
The bad news: The english dubbed soundtrack has been spliced together from various sources. Some good, some terrible. There is an audible ""click"" whenever there is a slice, as if this were edited together on a hand held tape recorder. And it probably was. The soundtrack, at times, goes horrably out of sinc with the picture
Producing laugh enducing results. (Mens voices coming from womens moths etc.)

  Please do not confuse this movie with DRACULA VS. FRANKENSTEIN directed by Al Adamson and starring John Bloom (Hills Have Eyes 2), Zandor Vorkov (The Brain), Lon Chaney (The Wolf Man) and  J. Carol Naish (Batman).  That film has a great battle between Frankie and Drac. Very violent and gory.",1170547200,3,3649,4.928338762214984
