8449111,2,B004Z0P68W,"1) Most of the Miles Davis fans I know consider the 2nd period from ""In a Silent Way"" to his ""retirement"" to be his best period. The 1973 band is a phenomenal group that has never been equaled to this day. Why is most of this video the 3rd period band widely considered to be Miles' weakest period?

2) God I get tired of camera people and editors on music videos. They all seem clueless. When Pete Cosey is playing they zoom in on Dave Liebman fooling with his amp. Too many closeups of the wrong thing. They never seem to get it right. When the entire band is playing as an ensemble they zoom in on Reggie Lucas' hat. One of the great things about live shows is seeing the band play like a single instrument. Once in awhile its nice to see a closeup of fingers and strings but MOST of it should be the whole band from front row center.

3) Good sound but really there are way better performances from this period, I can't help but thinking there is a better set from Montreux. Obviously Miles was in fine fettle.

I sure wish whoever is controlling the bulk of Miles output from this period would put the stuff out. Much of it is available on bootlegs, why can't the family or CBS release all this truly great stuff for fans? We long time fans know there is amazing stuff available. PUT IT OUT and put someone on it that knows how to edit and what to edit.",1324857600,13,1358,4.195402298850575
8449112,5,B004Z0P68W,"I love this music! Includes a nice selection from the Montreux performances, including a dynamite ""Ife"" from 1973, which is my favorite. Appearances by David Liebmann, John Scofield, and of course Kenny Garrett here and there throughout the disk. As a supplement, an interview with Santana. I'd love to see more of these performances!",1313971200,6,334,5.203703703703703
8449113,4,B004Z0P68W,"Judge James A. Stewart, DVD Verdict--Miles Davis: Live at Montreux 1973-1991 features ten of the best numbers from Davis and his band.
* ""Ife""--1973
* ""Speak: That's What Happened""--1984
* ""Code MD""--1985
* ""Pacific Express""--1985
* ""Jean-Pierre""--1986
* ""Heavy Metal Prelude""--1988
* ""Jo Jo""--1989
* ""Hannibal""--1990

Two numbers are from Sketches of Spain:

* ""The Pan Piper""--1991
* ""Solea""--1991

The highlights DVD opens with a whimper that's really a bang. Davis and his band are on stage, doing nothing, just waiting to perform. Tuning instruments gives way to gentle music as you wait for Davis to start blowing on his trumpet. When he does, ""Ife"" is eerily mesmerizing. Plenty of closeups let viewers see Davis and his band members at work.

The audio excellently captures both the boldness of Davis' trumpet and the pindrop softness of other sounds, including gentle taps on the drums or an almost whispering softness with the same trumpet.
