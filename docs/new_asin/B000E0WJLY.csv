8103718,3,B000E0WJLY,"This 2004 Canadian thriller is a pretty low budget looking flick and kinda slow at times... but if you're a Michelle Nolden or Katharine Isabelle fan, it's worth watching for sure.  The plot is a bit meh, but the acting isn't bad at all.  Unfortunately, the lesbian bits don't go beyond a couple of kissing scenes.

Very lovely and affluent 30something Sarah is off to her isolated cabin in the woods for a romantic getaway.  On her way out of the city, she's stuck in traffic and harassed by some teens doing the uninvited windshield cleaning bit.  In a moment of weakness, a couple of these teens exploit her kindness and end up in her car, forcing her to continue on to her cabin.  Upon arrival, they hold her captive but don't seem to have much of a plan outside of robbing her and getting off the streets.

As it turns out, they're all full of secrets and issues and off they go with little mind games and some odd bonding.

Kidnapping and lesbians are to-die-for plot elements in my wish book.  But there's nothing to get too excited about here and none of it plays out as good as you'll want it to... though I couldn't resist watching this after seeing Michelle Nolden (Sarah) in the trailer. Oh hell, I wanted to kidnap her!!  Just my kinda beauty.  I adored Katharine Isabelle (who plays a 16/17 yr old here) in American Mary and Ginger Snaps where she does twisted and sexy so well... not so much here.  She didn't really turn on her sexy side here and was just an unappealing and disturbed little cutter here.  I don't think the women here really pulled off the chemistry the script called for. The layered connections they were supposed to have was pretty weak.  Even so, I couldn't take my eyes off Sarah and she made the story worthwhile for me.  :)

I wouldn't call this a lesbian-themed flick by any means, but if you have a tolerance for such films and even like the bad stuff, lol... then you'll find this one to be watchable.",1413504000,,1944,4.433802816901409
8103719,3,B000E0WJLY,"This movie had an original plot, albeit a little strange. If you like a little odd, watch this. The acting were pretty good. I did not like the ending though.",1377993600,,158,4.3
8103720,3,B000E0WJLY,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie - it has the feel of a low-budget, independent movie, yet the cast was credible and the story, though not unique, pulled me in and made for an interesting watch. The story starts with yuppie, 30-ish Sarah (attractive Michelle Nolden) who is stuck in traffic, and encounters a pair of loutish teenagers, who try to 'squeegee' her of some money. She rebuffs them, but later has a change of heart and offers them some money. Before she knows it, both teens hop into her car and demand a ride. Jenna (Katharine Isabelle of Ginger Snaps) and Jackson (Kett Turton) overhear a cellphone conversation between Sarah and her lover Sam, and decide they want more out of Sarah, threatening her with a knife and gun and demanding she drive them to her rendezvous spot, a cottage located in a remote mountainous area.

Before long, the trio are engaged in a strange cat-and-mouse game, and the role of cat and mouse changes over the course of the movie. It was interesting to see this psychological drama play out as initially, one can't tell when one of the three characters is going to gain the upper hand, though ultimately the story does sink into predictability. Michelle Nolden shines in the role of yuppie Sarah, who might be harboring some secrets of her own, and Katharine Isabelle portrays the angsty teenager with a penchant for cutting herself very well. The story also deals with various issues such as abandonment, loneliness, adoption, lesbianism, etc. I'd rate it a fairly engaging psychological drama, though I felt let down by the ending which was rather anti-climactic.",1254614400,,1615,4.851449275362318
8103721,1,B000E0WJLY,"""Show Me"" begins as an interesting twist on the home invasion thriller but quickly loses its way and meanders into being a vague and unconvincing melodrama with some tacked on sexual elements.  The third act rapprochement between the characters is supposed to add depth to the story, but just comes off as a joke about Canadians being so polite that they can't even stay mad at their knife-wielding kidnappers.  Forgettable.",1239667200,,424,5.042857142857143
8103722,1,B000E0WJLY,"I'm no film critic, but my partner & i thought we wasted 2hrs of our time watching this movie. Wondering when this movie would end is a big sign of a slow & off the wall flick.",1224547200,,176,3.7837837837837838
8103723,4,B000E0WJLY,"Cassandra Nicolaou is a writer and director with a talent for exploring the inner lives of her characters.  Much of what she creates is on the surface: an equal part lies beneath the facade and reveals personal histories through the looks in eyes and the silences she encourages from her actors.

Affluent mid-thirties Sarah (the very fine Michelle Nolden) is off from the city for a rendezvous with her lover Sam, complete with special grocery shopping and wine cases to supply them for a little getaway in their isolated mountain cabin in the woods.  But when traffic snarls slows her luxury vehicle to a stop and her temper is frayed, two street kids approach, pull the squeegee scam and when rejected by Sarah, they sulk on the sidewalk and Sarah, remorseful for her behavior to them, offers them money.  They accept the money and jump into the car, brandishing weapons, and treat Sarah like a hostage, instructing her to drive them out of the city. Desperate but cool, Sarah receives a cellphone call from Sam, indicating the remote cabin meeting - and the atmosphere changes.  Now the girl, Jenna (the beautiful and talented Katharine Isabelle) and the boy, Jackson (Kett Turton, another fine young actor) are in complete control, and the three head to the cabin. Once in the picturesque cabin by a lake Jenna and Jackson tie Sarah to a chair and go about trying to find all possible cash and goods to steal from Sarah.

The 'kidnapping' gradually unveils secrets on the part of all three and slowly the trio, isolated and after attempted escapes by Sarah, begin to bond. The events then fall pall mall, video tapes of Sarah's private life reveal an aspect Jenna never suspected yet longs to understand and experience, Sarah and Jackson play a cat and mouse game that includes a degree of intimacy, an 'intruder' appears with dire consequences, and the film tumbles to a painful ending for each of the trio (now duo).

The film begins and ends with a voice over stating 'There are two kinds of people in the world: those who need to be rescued, and those who want to rescue.'  And the plot in retrospect examines that statement thoroughly. Writer/director Nicolaou has the integrity to incorporate gender identities, childhood needs and adoption policies, and the differences in reference points between those with money and those on the street in subtle ways, careful to not make judgments but to only reveal similarities.  The cast is very good and if the script is a bit repetitive in phrases over used, that is the way young people communicate and to script it otherwise would make the dialogue false.  This is a fine little thriller, more for the mind but also for the physical violence aficionados.  For this viewer, this is an underrated movie.

8103724,4,B000E0WJLY,"I am not so impressed the plot of this film, because it's not that original and it's kind of predictable. I found this film to be worthwhile watching because the three leads are great, especially the mesmerizing Katherine Isabelle who was also very good in Ginger Snaps. She plays Jenna, and she's a troubled teenager running away with her boyfriend Jackson(Kett Turton) who is also kind of messed up. On a fateful day, they came across Sarah(Michelle Nolden) who was stuck in traffic, and they decide to kidnap her purely for money. They went to a remote cottage up north that's where Sarah was held hostage. Jenna forced her to give out the pin of her bank card and got some money out, but not enough. While Sarah was planing to escape, she is being seduced by Jackson. At the same time, Jenna grew an attraction toward her as well. When someone showed up at the scene unexpectedly, things get out of control after an accidental murder takes place.....

This film is actually pretty low budget, and there not that many elaborate scenes and characters throughout the film. Most of the scenes take place in the wilderness of Norther Ontario. The acting is great, and I love Isabelle in this film. She's kind of bad and good and confused all at the same time. Some very demanding scenes for the three leads to work with.",1149552000,5,1319,4.6127659574468085
8103725,4,B000E0WJLY,"This was a very different movie. It was very enticing, and kept you wondering. The main character Sara is really beautiful and does an excellent job acting. I really enjoyed this movie except that there weren't any real lesbian scenes, maybe a kiss, and thats all. This movie is definatly one you have to think and pay attention to certain details to understand it.",1146700800,,365,4.71875
8103726,4,B000E0WJLY,"This is definitely a sharp one, and if you make it through the first twenty minutes, you will absolutely be pulled in through the last minute. It's intelligent, and it's a thriller -- the kind of thriller that is not blood and guts and unnecessary violence, but rather is intelligent and realistically disturbing.

Sarah is a successful, professional, sexy woman on her way to celebrate her tenth anniversary in a cabin by a lake. On the way out of town, however, two street teens let themselves into her car, hold her at gunpoint, and demand that she drives them to wherever she's going. Thus begins a ""vacation"" that will change everything, forever.

With an underlying message of ""there are two kinds of people in the world, those who need to be rescued, and those who want to rescue,"" the plot takes many turns that are intelligently connected and have surprising secrets (who knew it would turn into a lesbian story?) that make all three characters both heroes and victims.

Show Me is a story about a seemingly happy and perfect yuppy colliding paths with two distraught teenagers left on their own and yearning to get out. What results is a gripping, thrilling, mind game of a movie.",1143417600,11,1190,4.739130434782608
