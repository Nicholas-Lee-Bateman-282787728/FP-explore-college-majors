8056293,4,B0008ISM1S,"The Saddle Club - Stevie (Sophie Bennett), Lisa (Lara Jean Marshall) and Carole (Keenan MacWilliams) - ride again in this movie edited from the TV series.

First, Jake accidentally sets the barn on fire, and Red gets blamed.  The girls help prove Red's innocence.  Then Max and Deborah both work up the courage to propose to each other, with some help from the girls.  Now there's a wedding to plan!  But when Lisa is thrown off her horse, will the wedding be cancelled?

This fun movie was edited from episodes 21, ""Track Record"", 22, ""First Refusal"", 25 & 26, ""The Bridal Path"" Parts 1 & 2, from season 1.  (Strangely enough, all the photos on the DVD cover seem to be from season 2!) Those unfamiliar with the TV series may be confused, however.  The movie starts off with no character introductions, and proceeds forward assuming the viewer knows who everyone is. The copyright is 2002, although the DVD packaging is copyyright 2005 and states ""all-new movie"", which this is not.  It is, however, the first and only time I've seen these episodes in widescreen.  It's also the first time I've heard the full version of ""Hello World"".

Best friends Ashley and Melanie appear together at the beginning.  After this, Ashley figures into a subplot without Melanie. Melanie turns up again in the finale without Ashley, although it would make sense for Ashley to be present.

Two ""Let The Buyer Beware!"" warnings:  1) When you stick this DVD in your player, you will be forced to sit through four minutes of trailers. You can't skip past them, although you can fast forward through them.  Those with older DVD players may have problems playing the Goodtimes logo preceding the trailers (!) and trailer 3.  2) All the special features are DVD-Rom content.  If you don't have a computer with a DVD-Rom player (I don't), then you can't play the games.",1222646400,7,1845,4.733542319749216
