8263969,2,B0016PUSN2,"The site says that this disc is supposed to be English, which suggests it will include dubbing or subtitles. But the movie is entirely in Spanish, without any such options to turn on an English track. Bought this as a gift for someone else who, luckily, can understand Spanish well enough to still enjoy the film, but this is false advertising to sell the disc as an English version without actually including any English on it.",1483660800,2,428,4.644736842105263

The movies are very old, but easy to watch, the black and white is not damage, it was a great purchase and I'm very happy to have these movies next to the other ones from my collection.",1373414400,,299,4.0
8263976,5,B0016PUSN2,"Superproduction with a great cast to match this great love story!

Manuel and Soledad are in love. But their love is surrounded by sadness and tragedy. Mr. Pedro Antonio de Alarcn wrote the book and Julio Bracho and Gabriel Figueroa took care of the rest as only they could have done it. Only Figueroa could get away with those extreme close ups to the feminine eyes, in this case, Marins.

Love is not bigger than hate, or hard feelings, or charity, or contempt. This two characters, Manuel (Negrete) y Soledad (Marn), are handled by life like puppets, surrounded by people who not always do the right thing.

We witness Manuel's early childhood and then we wait another ten years from his departure until his comeback, when he makes thing even with the man who had taken everything he felt love for... even the woman who loved him... This movie shouldn't be missed!",1316995200,,867,4.690789473684211
