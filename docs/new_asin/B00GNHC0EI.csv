It will be a good reference for the next pilgrims",1404172800,,191,4.1891891891891895

8625078,5,B00GNHC0EI,"This documentary video from Spain-based Goya Producciones (released in the United States by Ignatius Press) gives a good overview of Pope Francis's electric World Youth Day debut in Rio De Janeiro in summer 2013. As an attendee, I was pleased to see many things on this DVD that I recognized from my experiences, such as the mass with three million people on Copacabana Beach, but also several things (like the pope's various visits and speeches around the city) that I was not privy to witness. The disc opens with a language option menu (English or Spanish) that then takes you to the main menu. In addition to the main hourlong documentary feature, this disc is loaded with ""extras"" ranging from a short documentary biography of Pope Francis (edited down from the longer DVD released by Ignatius Press earlier this year, ""Who Is Pope Francis?"") to various songs (including American Christian musician Matt Maher) from Eucharistic adoration with Francis on the beach. It also includes the Stations of the Cross from Friday night. My favorite extra on the disc was a special audience that Francis granted to youth from his homeland of Argentina, in which he delivers an impassioned little speech to them that is truly stirring. It's particularly wonderful that this little video is subtitled rather than dubbed, allowing you to hear the emotions in the Holy Father's voice. Some of the extra features are actually better than the main documentary on this DVD, which is dubbed in a questionable English (some words are mispronounced) that unfortunately covers the pope's memorable Spanish voice. But the main documentary is itself pretty good, walking you through each day of the pope's World Youth Day week, with plenty of good footage of the pope interacting with people. It gets a bit tedious and repetitive toward the end, as the film tries to squeeze in sound bytes from every papal event, but this DVD is a quite satisfying Valentine to the Latino pope's electric debut in Catholic South America. Having attended this World Youth Day myself as a first-timer, I must say I was overwhelmed by the ""rock star"" draw that Francis had during his week in Rio, which veterans of this popular once-every-three-years event told me was unlike anything since the early World Youth Days when John Paul II started them. More and more people, especially Brazilians, kept coming every day to see the pope. This video also captures his visits with the sick, poor, and addicted in Rio's slums and social outreach ministries. Very impressive stuff, even if you didn't happen to attend the festivities in Brazil.",1389484800,5,2598,4.974712643678161
