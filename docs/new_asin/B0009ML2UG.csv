2300593,1,B0009ML2UG,"I bought this DVD because I wanted to see Swayze dance as he did in ""Dirty Dancing"".  THIS is NOT that.  It is modern dancing in a studio and the plot is ridiculus.  Swayze is a fantastic dancer and it is poetry to see him really DANCE.  THIS film just not do it.",1125100800,7,263,3.9056603773584904
2300594,5,B0009ML2UG,"So few films have been made about the dance world, and this one captures the heart of it, with the insane hours of hard work, the sweat, and the frayed egos. The plot of ""One Last Dance"" is based on ""Without a Word,"" a play Patrick Swayze and his wife Lisa Neimi created many years ago. It is a wisp of a story, mostly about the emotions and conflicts of 3 dancers who are past their performance peak, returning to the stage for a benefit gala, to face their fears and the relationships they left behind.

Writer/director/actress and dancer Neimi, who has an inner and outer beauty so lovely to watch, has put ""One Last Dance"" together on a shoestring budget, with tremendous skill and a marvelous cast. The company dancers are superb, with a technical virtuosity in many styles, from traditional to the most contemporary. George de la Pena plays Max Delano, one of the 3 leads, and will be remembered from his days with the American Ballet Theater and on Broadway, and is dynamic both as a dancer and an actor. Other standouts include Matthew Walker as Alex McGrath, a sadistic choreographer, and Stefan Wenta as Orest, a poetic teacher who is an inspiration to all. Patrick Swayze as Travis is a marvel, with the athleticism and energy of someone half his age.

The wonderful score is by Stacy Widelitz, with non-original music that ranges from Beethoven's 7th Symphony, to a cameo by Daniel Heifetz (grandson of the legendary Jascha Heifetz) as a street violinist. The cinematography by Albert Dunk is terrific on the dance sequences, which sometimes have a touch of surrealism using smoke and other effects, and there are some magnificent overhead crane shots. Dance is not an easy thing to film, and in ""One Last Dance"" we have scenes that are spectacular. The interesting and sometimes inspired choreography is by Alonzo King, Dwight Rhoden, Doug Varone, and Patsy Swayze (Patrick's mother).

As someone who spent 2 decades of my life immersed in the world of dance, I appreciate the authenticity of this film, and the excellence of its performers. It is sure to become a film classic for dancers and those who love to watch them. DVD extras include a ""behind the scenes"" piece, and commentary by Patrick and Lisa. Total running time is 100 minutes.",1125014400,328,2255,4.7621483375959075
2300605,5,B0009ML2UG,Great movie for everyone who loves dance. Swayze did remarkably good as an actor battling his age. Alonzo King the man behind the choreography worth following through Lines Ballet.,1507075200,,180,5.241379310344827
2300606,5,B0009ML2UG,Incredible heartwarming story. Knowing the struggle Patrick went though in his personal life and knowing the female actress is his wife brings a whole new meaning to the movie,1506297600,,175,5.068965517241379

2300608,3,B0009ML2UG,"I didn't expect a ""Dirty Dancing"" type blockbuster, but I also didn't expect to force myself to watch it over a period of 3 days. I couldn't tell if it was the plot, actors (sans Patrick Swayze), the script or the directing/editing, that was so bad, but I was very disappointed.
I guess, if you take a step back, you could say that it was a life lessons movie, but I still wouldn't rank it very high.
If you have 2 hours to kill and you like Patrick Swayze, then watch this.",1502582400,,474,4.163043478260869

2300610,5,B0009ML2UG,"The funky plot and acting notwithstanding, the dance sequences were exquisite to me.  The last two dances (inside the movie, not during credits) performed by Patrick and Lisa moved me to tears - so beautifully expressed.  How amazing to to get to have that kind of a relationship with your spouse and how tragic.",1501891200,2,312,4.7592592592592595
2300611,2,B0009ML2UG,"As much as I like Patrick Swayze, this was the worse movie that I have seen him in.  The story plot was horrible and predictable.  Really, the old man just dies sitting in a chair????? I am not sure who instigated this movie but it really felt forced between Patrick and his wife.  She is a TERRIBLE actor.  I think this movie was made in 2003 and Lisa Niemi was 47 years old?  Just too old for it to be believable.  The daughter was 6 or 7, which means the last time the two characters danced together was at that time, supposedly in their prime.  Sorry, it felt like a forced effortand an excuse to display their dancing abilities.  The dancing was alright considering all the editing that probably took place.  I didn't like the soundtrack at all.  Not surprised that Lisa Niemi wrote the screen play and needed to star in it, lol.  I agree with another reviewer that she should stay in the background.",1501545600,,905,4.391566265060241

2300613,2,B0009ML2UG,"Too confusing plot.  The dancing was great, but As much as I love Patrick Swayze's acting I did not care for the part his wife played or maybe it was her directing.  It just did not touch me.",1500076800,,191,4.0
2300614,3,B0009ML2UG,"The movie itself was average; however, the dance scenes were great. Some of the acting reminded me of the 80/90s Patrick Swayze. One item of the plot device which I just couldn't overlook was that it was supposed to have been a seven yr gap since the last time they were dancing, yet they were able to just start dancing at a professional level with no issues. I thought at least we would have one montage of them getting back into shape. But nope, they just seemed to be able to do everything they did from seven yrs ago. Which wouldn't be too much of a problem if the dance moves weren't so damn outstanding and complex. That said, pull your girl (er, ummmmm, ""significant other,"" LOL!) close, grab some popcorn and watch.",1493510400,2,724,4.451127819548872
2300625,5,B0009ML2UG,If you like dance movies and Patrick Swazey you will like this movies.  His real-life wife is the love interest in this movie.  Liked it very much.,1492646400,,147,4.407407407407407
2300626,3,B0009ML2UG,"Swayze is great in this film, as dancer, actor, and survivor, marvelous as he proved himself again & again throughout his career. Unfortunately, the story is not, and due to the necessary format required for a dance-based story, could not possibly have been, substantially different from other films of its type.",1491609600,,312,5.137254901960785
2300627,3,B0009ML2UG,"The movie is appropriately named. The last dance is the only good part of the film. Save yourself the pain of watching this movie, and skip right to the final dance, which is awesome. The acting is horrible and the plot is missing. In an attempt to make an ""artsy/expression"" film, they forgot to tell a story. This was obviously a personal film, made for personal reasons, so it's no surprise that it doesn't have public appeal. It wasn't meant for us, and it shows. Have you ever read a poem that was so abstract that only the author gets it? That is this film. I watched it because of who was in it, but it was physically and mentally painful to watch.",1490572800,3,655,4.333333333333333

of a steadily aging dancer whose technique appeared to be waning.  A slightly better script wouldn't have hurt either.

I think it's totally unfair that ppl who are reviewing this film have the gall to compare his and Lisa's skill and talent here, to the dumber than dumb FICTION of ""Dirty Dancing"".  This film is all and only about dance- the interpretive dance as only top shelf dancers can produce. Swayze was initially trained as a classical ballet star, and this film, IMO, shows that skill and power in every dance scene performed. You can almost reach out and touch the ephemeral feelings of love Patrick and Lisa share.  The fact that the world lost such talent shortly after this film was made, is sobering.  RIP Patrick.

2301422,2,B0009ML2UG,"I like to watch dance movies and enjoy watching Patrick Swayze dance so, after reading other people's reviews on this movie, I thought I would watch it. The opening dance scene was very good. However, while I enjoyed the dancing in the movie, I did not enjoy the movie itself. The dialog and plot seemed disjointed and underdeveloped. The acting lacked depth. The three main characters are in their 40s, are passionate about dance, and come together to dance again. Each of them had ended their dance careers prematurely for a variety of reasons. So they grapple with ghosts of their past and bodies that are past their prime to pull together a dance. At the end, the dancers deliver a dance that seems to close the doors on the past and push them toward a brighter future. One dancer gains confidence and the other two renew their commitment to each other. In summary, the movie started well and ended well. The material in the middle was mostly forgettable.",1436745600,6,959,4.680473372781065

Knowing from reading their book together, and her book after his passing, how close these two people are, I expected more chemistry between them in this movie.  When it became apparent to me that they were going to be characters at odds in this film, It was a struggle to feel any romantic tension between them.  If I don't get to see them love each other, then I atleast want to be convinced there is some hidden desire between them.  When there are scenes with any chance at dialogue for them, they always seemed shut down quickly by Lisa's character walking out in a huff and going off to smoke somewhere, which is not enjoyable to watch.  The dancing scenes were very nice.  I am not a dancer but can appreciate how fit and flexible they both were in their early 50's, much better shape than me 20 years younger.  These scenes were enjoyable and I, like many other female reviewers have said, cried while watching them dance together.  It is bittersweet.  I may watch this movie again when I need another Patrick fix, but the poor storyline, writing, and the stunted ending left me a bit cold.",1378166400,2,1170,4.455399061032864

Those few minutes would have been when the dancing was good and the performers kept their mouths shut. The story line and the acting made me want to vomit. Sorry but I hated this movie and an it was not worth the rental fee I paid. There was very little excitement or proper romantic tension in this film and I really felt like shutting it off.

That being said there are probably people that relate to these character's and their whiny dispositions but I did not. It was a story of lost love. The love of dance was lost and lovers were torn apart and brought back together but the people where just not likable in my opinion. I could not feel for them the way one normally does in a movie like this.",1352073600,3,833,4.173913043478261

It is that - a keepsake.  Patrick Swayze was not a great actor, but he was so passionate with his characters that they were believeable.  The story is a bit hard to follow and there is lots and lots of dance rehearsals which can get boring, but finally when he and his wife do their whole dance together it was beautiful.

2301551,5,B0009ML2UG,"After seeing Patrick Swayze for the first time in ""North & South,"" the TV mini-series and then in ""Dirty Dancing,"" I was hopelessly in love with him (from afar), and have now read his Biography ""One Last Dance"" and his Autobiography ""The Time of My Life"" that he & wife Lisa wrote together.  I loved both books along with this DVD, which starred Patrick & Lisa together that I just discovered on Amazon.com.  It was a wonderful story about love, dance, & everything in between!!!  I would highly recommend getting it ~ I don't think anyone who is a Patrick Swayze fan would be disappointed.  Of course, I watched all of Patrick's movies, read anything & everything I could get my hands on about ""Dirty Dancing"" ~ as the opening scene was shot in VA (my home state) & then all of the rest of it was shot in a little sleepy town, almost tucked into the mountains of eastern NC named Lake Lure.  We vacationed near there in '97 about 10 yrs. after the making & release of ""Dirty Dancing"" and we went there, talked to a lot of the locals who remembered when & where they had made the movie.  It turned out to be an old Boys Scouts camp.  So we found it & I walked around and saw what little remained of anything that resembled ""Dirty Dancing"" ~ like one cabin was still standing (sort of like Johnny's cabin), and the small creek that Johnny & Baby danced across on the log, the remnants of ""Baby's Steps"" still etched in the dirt, but most of the land was untouched except the little cabins where the dancers stayed had been torn down & the main building, a portion of it had burned.  But just walking around, I closed my eyes & swear that I could hear the wonderful music from the movie ~ even if it was in my head!!!  Even now, I can be anywhere, walking through a store & if a song comes on from the movie, I immediately recognize it!!!

The next time we were there was for the ""1st Annual Dirty Dancing Festival"" in Sept. '10.  We even stayed in the Lake Lure Inn, where all the cast & crew of the movie had stayed while making the movie.  However, the old campgrounds had been sold, they were putting in a housing development, & it looked nothing like it even did in '97.  (It made me wish I had gone sooner!!) It was sad, as I suppose I was expecting it to be the same.  But, like life, nothing stays the same.  But I'm glad I went the first time, and even the festival was nice....very hot, but nice.  Since we live in VA, Lake Lure is only about a 5 hr. drive for us, so both trips was worth it!!!

There are cuts and closeups which take advantage of film's immediacy and flexibility, but often the dances are shot wide, the dancers shown from head to toe, and we get to experience all they express. The overhead shots, in particular, are gorgeous, give a unique sense of the flow of the dances, and are used with intelligent restraint.

I can't argue with many of the criticisms other reviewers have mentioned, but I wish the photographers of movies like ""Step-Up"" had the courage and trust to follow this film's example.",1227398400,2,614,4.838095238095238

They took musical notes and made them into a love song.  The fact that they aren't twenty anymore made it even more of an accomplishment. Their lines, their extension, their strength, their fluid expression were all beautiful to watch.  Lisa's flexibility was unbelievable at any age.  The story was very true to life, shown in flashbacks, and the dancing superb. I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that the dancers looked real, sweaty and out of breath.  They weren't all made up or their hair perfect. The third dancer George de la Pena was a very great surprise to me because I hadn't seen him dance before.

was sloppy at best and the dancing, the reason one would buy such a movie, was just tolerable.  Don't know what

the director of this bomb was thinking,  but here's hoping this was their last film.",1167868800,2,309,4.1525423728813555
2301588,4,B0009ML2UG,"This movie is not without flaws--the dialogue and acting occasionally seem flat, recycled storylines, melodrama, etc., yet I am a sucker for dance movies and loved it nonetheless.  It's pretty obvious from the get-go that Travis and Chrissa are soul mates destined to reconnect after seven years of separation and misunderstandings.  When Alex, the emotionally abusive director of a New York Dance Company, goes too far with his criticisms (this is the point where I'd like to introduce people of Alex's bent to the wonders of Dale Carnegie in helpfully motivating people), three dancers' lives are redirected.  Chrissa has a nervous breakdown (we later learn that she was newly pregnant during this scene, so horomones and stress contributed to her break) while Travis (injured from overexertion) can do little to comfort her besides telling off Alex.  Max, the other member of the pas de trois, carries off a sobbing and temporarily deranged Chrissa to the nearest mental health hospital. (The three dancers were days away from premiering a pas de trois dance before this misfortune interrupts them.) Travis wrongfully assumes that Chrissa hasn't contacted him because she wants her space and wants him out of her life (he doesn't realize she had been hospitalized).  Chrissa, meanwhile, is hurt that Travis hasn't inquired after her and therefore, keeps her pregnancy a secret from him.  Max is the middle man, and seven years later, he is instrumental in reconnecting the estranged lovers when the struggling company decides to resurrect the Pas de Trois.

Yes, the plot is the stuff of soap operas, but it has heart, and the real-life love between Patrick Swayze (Travis) and his wife, Lisa Niemi (Chrissa), is palpable on-screen. Also, I can always empathize with someone who is experiencing a breakdown of sorts (read my Fred Luskin's ""Forgive for Good"" and Sylvia Plath's ""The Bell Jar"" reviews for an insider's perspective on what an awful experience this is). In addition, I appreciate this movie's undercurrent theme: move beyond the negative voices we've picked up through the years.

Swayze and Niemi are no longer twentysomethings, yet they hold their own in this physically demanding art form.  They dance beautifully.

In the behind-the-scenes special feature, Swayze said that this production hired four choreographers to represent the latest happenings in the dance world.  I loved the choreography and the dancing--it was breathtaking and innovative. I was thrilled to see some of the very same dancers in this movie who have graced the covers of Dance and Pointe magazines. The dancers said that they felt like they really were members of the movie's dance company and that there was a spirit of collaboration and non-competitiveness as well as a suspension of ego during filming. One dancer said that he and the other dancers could easily and happily tour the movie's original dances to (he confidentally believed) great acclaim.",1164326400,81,2950,5.176470588235294
2301589,5,B0009ML2UG,"I am a dancer. I found the choreography in this movie beautiful, brillient and different. The emotion in it really touched me, and I had actually fallen out of dancing because of many different reasons and this movie really did bring me back to my love of dance. It's very rare to find dance movie that will offer quite as much as this movie did. Not to mention I absolutly adore George De La Pena. Awsome dancer and he was my favorite character in the movie. I love the fact that every character has something they are working through, no one is exactly perfect. To me, although the acting may not be what every one would call oscar quality, to me, it shows a glimps in to life. How pent up emotions can lead to frustrations that are some times difficult to get through. This movie, to me is well worth the watch. Sorry for the ramble.",1163721600,10,836,4.3312101910828025

2301591,2,B0009ML2UG,"Thank goodness my wife and I rented this movie because it is a one-viewing-only experience. We are introduced to Patrick Swayze's character and he seems the country hayseed who just got off the train from Booniesville. Later, we learn he's been ""all over the world"". Then we have to endure watching Lisa Neimi having, or reliving, her repeated emotional breakdowns. Boo hoo. Oh, don't forget George De La Pena. One minute he's prodding the two former lovers, (Swayze and Neimi), into dancing the production they've all reunited to do. The next he's crying at his makeup table because he never believed he, himself, could complete the darn task. Oh please!!! The story is so full of drama queens it's beyond belief!!! I have to admit that my wife and I spent most of the movie chuckling at the acting, the story and finally the lover's dance sequences. My major complaint was we hardly got to see these ""great dancers"" dance. There were plenty of waist up shots of the pair emoting their polarizing love/hate feelings. Demonstrations of their dance skill? It seemed to be a case of hiding their weaknesses. And, then there's Neimi's fatherless daughter. It wasn't too hard to figure out who's daddy. This plotline is so tired and comes at you thousands of miles before it's revealed. No surprise here.

Now let's be real. The threesome, who are supposed to be saving this dance company with their performance, were all pushing their mid 40's when we see the flashbacks of seven years prior!!! Now the movie is trying to convince us that not one, but three people are going to beat the odds, and are expected to perform like the kiddies?!?!? As I said, we had to hold back the giggles.

Three things of note should be added here:

1. Watch the extra feature on this DVD. Neimi and Swayze, (real life husband and wife), show SO MUCH more of an emotional connection there than they ever could muster for the movie's performance. When not of the wooden variety, their emotional range swung to a stupefying over acting. Again, boo-hoo.

2. The movie's lighting director and photographer should have been fired on the spot. Miss Neimi  looks quite ancient and Swayze looks like his face is plastic. During one scene Patrick wants to practice a jump-catch!!! We cringed because it was like telling us our grandma was going to make the same attempt. We were convinced if Lisa fell it would be the preverbal ""old woman"" breaking her hip. Again, refer to the extra features. They look quite pleasant and Neimi looks like she may even be able to pull this wishing well story off.

3. Lastly, I would say the sequences with the other dancers gathered for this movie were very good. They were quite entertaining to watch and were performed with inventive choreography. Three cheers for the understudies!!! Hurrah, Hurrah, Hurrah!!!

I have mixed emotions about this film. On one hand I like to root for the ""old-timer"" who makes good. On the other, it is tremendously embarrassing watching ""old people"" look foolish. Unfortunately my rooting turned to laughing in disbelief. Rent, don't buy, this movie as ironic camp and for the intermittent supporting dancers' sequences.",1157932800,11,3159,4.828096118299445

2301594,4,B0009ML2UG,"This is a beautiful film that will touch anyone who knows a lot or at least some things about professional dance. It has a very effective atmosphere and nice dance scenes. The story is also interesting, with nice acting and inspirational quotes. The choreographies are very good without any doubt, and I really liked the costumes! There are some very good dancers in this film. I would prefer a professional dancer in the place of Patrick Swayze. Patrick is a great actor but unfortunately only an amateur when it comes to dance. No matter how the director films it, it is not possible to entirely hide the fact that he is no pro and the difference with the rest of the dancers is obvious. Still, I enjoed the film and this proves that it is generally composed in a great way.",1150156800,2,776,4.51063829787234
2301595,5,B0009ML2UG,"I waited years for this movie to be released in the United States.  As far as I was concerned, it wasn't about the acting, as much as it was about the ""feeling"" the actors wanted to portray, in which they, profoundly, accomplished.
  I would recommend this movie to anyone who can reach that one step deeper into the minds of creativity and passion, and appreciate the struggles of rising above and beyond the pain of broken dreams.",1147046400,3,432,4.584415584415584
2301596,3,B0009ML2UG,"This was a paean to and by the Swayze's . . . and if you like their type of dancing this was for you.  There was not much of a story line.  And in most of the movie two of the main characters were morose, angry at the world, and angry at each other.  This didn't help my appreciation of the film.

It is difficult to look upon dance as these dancers do, that it is the be-all and end-all of one's existence.  The life span of a dancer as a dancer is so short that if they really felt this way they would end up doing away with themselves after their five or ten years in their field.  That the Swayze's have returned to dance after years away, and that they have such passion as they have tried to show, was hard for me to relate to as anything short of fanciful.

It is pleasant to see movie personalities, though, with real talent, rather than just looking pretty for the camera.",1143158400,3,881,4.087209302325581
2301597,3,B0009ML2UG,"Though this is a small movie, it should delight fans of Patrick Swayze and dance. Not a Dirty Dancing type movie but one in which he can star with his wife.

I have to saythought for many....it was disheartening to see you perform with your wife, Patrick, because so many of us have fantasized of that same possibility!

I would recommend it to ALL who love dance!  It is a beautiful tribute to what a person CAN do!",1140220800,8,435,4.538461538461538
2301599,5,B0009ML2UG,"I have heard about this movie for years and was so happy that the Swayze's finally decided to take it on themselves to put it out there.

  I have been a fan of Patrick's for many years but never knew the extent of his talent, and when paired with his wife Lisa - it is pure, unadulterated beauty to watch them in the final performance of this movie. I cried several times while watching it - but the final scene is just breathtaking. George de la Pena is masterful in his own right.

  I think if you were a fan years ago of the movie ""Fame"" or ""Flashdance"" you will ""get"" this movie. If you are strictly a fan of Patrick's and looking for a Patrick Swayze film to enjoy on a rainy Sunday afternoon - I think you will love this movie too - especially when you see the depth this actor and his wife pull from to have created this masterpiece - and what they pull from the entire cast and crew.

  Incredible - will view time and time again!

2301600,4,B0009ML2UG,"If you love dance (balletic, rather than ballroom), you'll surely enjoy this offering starring husband and wife team Patrick Swayze and Lisa Nieme.  Directed, as well, by the latter, the film also stars dancer/actor George Dr La Pena. Assisting the stars are young dancers of breathtaking ability. The entire company deserves high marks!  The slight story of former lovers (Swayze and Nieme) brought back together for ""one last dance"" is merely a device to allow the cast to show their balletic ability.  The most haunting image of the film is provided by the shots of a solo Swayze dancing in a darkened studio amid wnd-tossed gauzy curtains.  The Swayzes had tried for years to interest Hollywood studios in the film, finally producing and releasing it on their own. An insightful audio ""making of"" track provides interesting details.  I recommend this film for its fine dance work, in spite of its slight story line.",1130457600,10,919,4.980392156862745
2301601,3,B0009ML2UG,"OK - it's not Casablanca. It's a dance film, and a well done one. Very enjoyable, beautifully danced, and some of the best (note: not ALL of the best, but some) modern young choreographers are represented here. Also, both Patrick and Lisa are really easy on the eyes and they dance amazingly together. The labour of love this film represents gives it a special glow. Expect a pretty series of dance sequences and you won't be sorry you spent your time.",1128643200,,452,4.592592592592593
2301602,5,B0009ML2UG,"This is a fantastic movie, but only if you are truly aware of what dancers go through to perform.  If you are not a lover of ballet and modern dance you are not going to like this movie.  If you are a Patrick Swayze fan unless you are a ballet lover you will enjoy the movie only once or twice.  Me - I could watch it over and over again.  Lisa Niemi (Swayze's real-life wife) is also a superb dancer.

2301603,1,B0009ML2UG,"I have always enjoyed Patrick in all of his other movies.  And I have always wanted to see Patrick and Lisa dance together.  How could this movie be bad?  Oh it was.  The story left a lot to be desired, the acting by the two main characters was so stilted (yes I understand it was meant to be - but no hidden passion even came across), even the dancing between the two - there was no feeling there until the end and even then it was as tho they didn't like each other much.  So I guess if the was the intention - it did come across.  However all the other dancers were wonderful to watch!  That part I loved. I was fasinated with how ill Patrick looks.  Raspy voice, gaunt.  And what's with the cover picture?  Never once did I see her in that outfit!

I think the best part of the of the movie was Patrick's song in the credits.  I do happen to really like his singing voice.",1128211200,15,876,4.058479532163743

2301605,5,B0009ML2UG,"Patrick Swayze is a man of many talents.  He is an exceptional actor, dancer, and singer.  I purchased this movie solely because he was in it.  :)
However, I was VERY pleasantly surprised that there was so much more to this movie!  The storyline was wonderful.  Very little dialog is needed. The story of three dancers returning to the dance world is told through their dancing.
It was intriguing to watch the 40 something year olds dance their hearts out, often along side the 20 something year olds. I would love to watch ""The Company"" dance together in person... if that were only possible.  They all meshed together extremely well.
Lisa Neimi did a wonderful job.  Her ability to dance, act, and direct is stunning.
George de la Pena's acting and dancing skills were breath taking as well.

Don't watch this movie with your eyes only, FEEL it through your heart and soul!",1126396800,120,875,4.673202614379085
2301606,4,B0009ML2UG,"ONE LAST DANCE appears to be a film for dancers, either active or retired, wannabees or romanticists.  There is some terrific Brazilian influenced music from Stacy Widelitz that enhances much of the corps dancing and some beautiful moments of cinematography making the most of a bare ballet studio rehearsal hall - both of which add what dreaminess this low budget film has to offer.

Written and directed and produced and acted by Lisa Niemi the story involves the return to the boards by three retired dancers (Lisa Niemi, Patrick Swayze, George de la Pena - all three are dancers in real life) to pay homage to the gifts of a highly regarded yet now dead choreographer.  The three left dancing seven years prior to the story for personal reasons, mostly involving lack of confidence and personal issues that affected  each tangentially.  They return to a company to perform a dance by the dead choreographer and the rest of the slim story is how these out of shape hoofers regain the healing magic of dancing.

The corps of ballet dancers assembled for this film is exceptionally fine for a pickup group: Rasta Thomas, Desmond Richardson, Kathryn Bradney, Tai Jiminez, Bambi Swayze, Jamie Bishton, Stephanie Slater, Heather Thompson, Dwight Rhoden and  Yosuke Mino deserve special mention.  The scenes of dancing vary depending on the choreography of each of four artists - Alonzo King, Dwight Rhoden, Patsy Swayze, and Doug Varone.  But in the end to be less than a documentary about the rigors and rewards of dancing there must be a well-acted story based on a sensitive script and that is where the film is shaky and a bit self indulgent.  Swayze, Niemi, de la Pena take the roles as far as they go, but in the end the story is much ado about very little.

Yet there is some gorgeous dance work well filmed that will satisfy even the most particular critic.  The DVD  added features include some insights into the difficulty and final rewards of bringing ONE LAST DANCE to the screen, and in these comments there is more story than that found in the script.

2301607,4,B0009ML2UG,"Patrick Swayze and his real-life wife, Lisa Niemi, are stunning to watch as they dance, either together or in individual practice or in groups. This is lovely, breathtaking dancing coming from ""older"" folks. As usual, Swayze is poetry in motion and proves once again how very versatile an actor he is. (Who else can play a believable drag queen, a classical ballet/jazz dancer, dramatic roles and  villains?) Lisa Niemi has remarkable grace and flexibility for her age and her acting is passable.

But the plot is lame and a little more attention could have been paid to making it less ordinary; that is the only complaint. As an aside, the cover photo on the DVD case never happens in the film.

George de la Pena, the co-star dancer, is just fabulous. In fact, all the dancers are a joy to watch. If you love the Dance, you will enjoy this film. If you want a good plot, look elsewhere.",1125360000,28,888,4.572327044025157
2301608,4,B0009ML2UG,"No, it's not ""Dirty Dancing;"" this film is about real, classical dancing that is a joy to watch.  Patrick Swayze, Lisa Neimi, and George de la Pena are brilliant dancers and bring the somewhat thin, yet still moving story to life.  The company of supporting dancers is excellent, and the film shows the realities of a life of back-breaking work with few rewards lived mostly 'for the love of the game.'  A tribute to true beauty, the final dance sequence is breathtaking.",1125100800,31,471,4.719512195121951

8063233,5,B0009ML2UG,"INCREDIBLY beautiful and truly a piece of art! From the first BEAUTIFUL note of music and the first very artistic camera shot, I was RIVETED! I have read Patrick and Lisa's memoir, ""Time Of My Life"" and Lisa's book "" Worth Fighting For: Love, Loss and Moving Forward"". It was so beautiful to see them dance - together and solo. The emotion and expressiveness of their dancing is gorgeous! The story of ""One Last Dance"" IS their story - they LIVED it! I will be watching this film again and again. Patrick and Lisa are incredibly artistic, creative people, and I thank them for sharing it with us.

It is very obvious from this film that what Patrick wrote in their memoir, is absolutely true for both of them: ""Of all the things I loved to do, nothing came close to the feeling dancing gave mea feeling of complete emotional and physical freedom, as if your spirit is soaring in all directions at once. Its hard to capture in words the sheer joy and fulfillment that the act of dancing can bring. All I knew was, I wanted to do it forever.
