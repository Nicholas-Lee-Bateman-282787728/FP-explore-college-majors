2269016,1,B00097DY3Y,"more corporate greed ,they know people want complete seasons but they don't care..all these episodes will be realeased in volumes and after that they will be realeased in seasons just so they can milk you for every dime you have.they did the same thing with scooby doo where are you and the biggest joke was the twilight zone which had 43 ..thats right freakin 43 volumes and then after that they realease complete seasons..i think i'll pass on these volumes for now F-U-W-B",1131062400,4,474,4.72289156626506
2269017,4,B00097DY3Y,"The 80s were a goldmine decade of great animated shows. Stuff we got in those ten years we just don't see any more. Quite literally. I don't think we'll ever see Denver the Last Dinosaur or Centurions on DVD. One of the forgotten shows among dozens of others was A Pup Named Scooby-Doo. The Scooby-Doo franchise suffered a heavy blow in the 80s when some silly man wearing a suit thought it would be a good idea to introduce Scrappy-Doo, a highly irritating doggy who never kept his mouth shut for more than two seconds. Freddy and Velma also disappeared for a while and Shaggy, Scooby and Scrappy would go off solving mysteries with just Daphne.

Desperate for a new way to re-invent the franchise, Warner gave us A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, an interesting, if failed attempt.

The show features the Mystery Inc. gang as kids and Scoob as a little puppy. The humor and animation is more offbeat and Looney-Tunes orientated but the mysteries are still substantial and the locations still occasionally Gothic and atmospheric.

Shaggy and Scooby are still voiced by Casey Kasem and Don Messick. Since they are the backbone of the show it's good to have this consistency. The childhood angle also gives us new insight into their background.

Many have criticised this show, claiming it to be aimed at under-tens and that it an embarrassment to the Scooby-Doo franchise. Well, I never found it to be that way. As a Scooby-Doo fan I thought this show was very amusing and I loved the score and songs by John Debney. There should be a soundtrack CD released. It really is a shame it never lasted for longer.

Since there were only 26 episodes made I can't help but be angry at Warner's awful DVD presentation of the show. Since they are releasing loads of their back-catalogue animation in beautifully packaged box sets (Premier Collections/Spotlight Collections/Golden Collections) I find it baffling that A Pup Named Scooby-Doo (a show that would have suited this format well) gets a horrid DVD release with 4 episodes per disc, a crappy snap-case box (we're STILL getting these in 2005!) and no extra features. The 1.33:1 full frame picture and Mono sound are perfectly adequate but, even though the show failed, it still deserves a much better DVD release than the one it got.

Shame on you Warner for neglecting this one instalment of a cash-cow that has generated you billions of dollars.",1128384000,17,2384,4.788321167883212

2269019,5,B00097DY3Y,"Even though there are no extras on the DVD, the episodes look great on the DVD format. We have the Pilot episode along with Wanted Chedder Alive and even the Comic Book one. One thing that is great about the DVD is that the show is not edited for release. Check out the scene with the Shirly McCloone Character in the pilot. on the DVD she comes out of the bushes and it types her name with ""wierdo"" underneeth her name. I guess CN edited that out as not to offend.
The cartoons look great in terms of color, but the menu Puppy could have been drawn better as it looked not up to par as he should have been drawn. It was cute to see him wink and his ears wiggle and so forth...
the WB has done this show right... It really doen't need extras for some groovy fun and the DVD keeps them the way they were aired originally... I hope that other DVDs will take a cue from the WB and leave the shows intact... So Grab a bowl of popcorn and get ready to have fun with a Pup Named Scooby Doo.",1122163200,5,984,4.0
2269020,4,B00097DY3Y,"In 1988, after a semi-disastrous attempt by Hanna-Barbera to ""babify"" the Flintsones, the studio made an attemt to try again with one of their most famous shows.  This time, however, it worked.

The basic premise of the original Scooby sereis remains intact (minor criminal commits cvrime while dressed in a Halloween costume) but the gang themselves--Fred, Velma, Daphne, Shaggy and Scooby--appear as children, about 10 years yuonger than they were in the original series.  The artwork style itself was a drastic departure from the realism present in the orignal ""Scooby-Doo"" series of 1969; instead, this series draws its influence from the old sight-gag cartoons of the 1940s.  The kids themselves, with the exception of Shaggy and SCooby, have had complete personality and appearance makeovers.  They look nothing like their teenage selves.

The series was very successful, running from 1988-1991 on ABC and earning an Emmy nomination for Best Animated SEries in 1989.  It also marked the return to television of Fred, Velma and Daphne.  I give this series f out 5 stars.  I withheld the last star due to this show not being released in full box set or full season format.  Even if you have never seen the original Scooby show,  you can understand this series, as it is a omplete stand-alone show.",1121904000,5,1301,5.0327102803738315
2269021,5,B00097DY3Y,"FINALLY! I can't even begin to tell you how excited I am about this show finally being released onto DVD! ""A Pup Named Scooby Doo"" was one of the best (not to mention funniest) Scooby Doo spin-offs. It ran from 1988-1991 and has had a home on Cartoon Network for as long as I can remember. Unfortunately Cartoon Network has butchered up the show with their non-sense 3 commercial breaks every show, so I am just relieved that this show will finally be releeased commercial-free. If you are a true Scooby Doo fanatic, this DVD is for you.",1117756800,8,537,4.489795918367347
2269022,5,B00097DY3Y,"Although I was hoping for this series to come out in the boxset format, it's great that WB is finally releasing ""A Pup Named Scooby Doo"" on DVD.

A Pup Named Scooby-Doo was one of the better Scooby Doo spinoffs, and ran from 1988 to 1991. It revolves around the Mystery Inc gang when they were kids, and when Scooby-Doo was still a puppy. This DVD contains the first 4 episodes to be aired. in the first episode ""A Bicycle Built for Boo"" scooby and the gang try to solve the mystery of the green glob that stole Shaggy's bike. In ""Wanted Cheddar Alive"", a cheese monster wreaks havoc in the Scooby Snack factory and threatens to close it down. ""The Shnook Who Took My Comic Book"" finds Shaggy and Scooby coming face to face with a monster from their favorite comic book Commander Cool. Finally in ""The Sludge Monster from the Earth's core"", a sluge monster that just robbed a bank is using scooby's kennel to hide from the cops.

Keep up the good work WB and please release more Scooby-Doo series on DVD. personally I'd love to see the 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo on DVD.",1114128000,7,1067,4.411167512690355

2269029,5,B00097DY3Y,"Growing up as a Scooby Fan, this series was my absolute favorite! I had this in my amazon cart for quite some time, however I was always too skeptical to buy it because there are very little DVD's out there for this particular spin-off. After receiving this item, I have been overjoyed with the quality of this DVD! It comes with 2 separate discs that do kind of lay weird in the case but have their own holders. I did accidentally snap one out while opening, but it took half of a second to pop back into place with zero damage to the disc.

2269053,3,B00097DY3Y,"I love scooby doo, and I give the original 5 stars...that's the 'baseline' from which I judge all other iterations. 'What's new scooby doo is great! Mystery incorporated is amazing. And this one is good too. Very different but it's pretty good too. Everything without that rat bastard scrappy is always good. Scrappy single handedly destroyed scooby doo do anything with him not in it is a blessing. A pup named scooby doo did trade in scrappy doo for another type of obnoxious theme though. They wrote Freddy to be... Well...damn near retarded.
They write his character out to be the biggest hindrance to the 'gang' and in absolutely no way helpful. Scrappy doo is obnoxious %100 of the time. Using those numbers as a baseline, I give Freddy an 'obnoxiousity' (not a real word lol) rating of about %81.....that being said, overall I give it 3/5 stars. My love for scooby doo will always outweigh my 'hates'.",1465257600,,908,4.753164556962025

2269126,5,B00097DY3Y,"I know I should talk about how much I love 'A Pup Named Scooby-Doo', and what makes it so funny and great, but I'm not really much of a reviewer, and the only reason I'm actually doing this is to give possible buyers an idea on what they'd be getting if they consider this. So here it is, the list of episodes as they originally aired on ABC's Saturday Morning timeslot (between September and December of 1988):

DISC ONE:
1.  A Bicycle Built for Boo!
The gang trails the trail of a monstrous bike thief.

2.  The Sludge Monster From the Earth's Core
Scooby's doghouse is haunted by a one-eyed monster responsible for a recent bank robbery.

3.  Wanted Cheddar Alive
Until the mystery of a cheesy monster is solved, there will be no more Scooby Snacks, which spells trouble for Scooby.

4.  The Schnook Who Took My Comic Book
When Shaggy's precious comic book is stolen by a comic book villain, Commander Cool and Mellow Mutt are on the case.

5.  For Letter or Worse
The ghost of a notorious gangster appears, and gets a television station shut down.

6.  The Babysitter From Beyond
The kids inadvertently get caught between a prison escapee, a horrendous babysitter, and a three-headed zombie.

7.  Now Museum, Now You Don't
Shaggy and Scooby are blamed for the robbery of a priceless museum artifact.

8.  Snow Place Like Home
An Ice Demon forces a couple's ski lodge to go bankrupt.

DISC TWO:
9.  Scooby Dude
A trip to the beach finds the gang trying to stop a headless skateboarder.

10.  Ghost Who's Coming to Dinner?
On Halloween, the gang must help a ghost solve the mystery of pirate, or risk having him disappear forever.

11.  The Story Stick
A living Totem Pole haunts an Indian Reservation.

12.  Robopup
Daphne's home is robbed by a ghostly chef; Scooby clashes with a robotic dog.

13.  Lights...Camera...Monster!
In the first-season finale, a movie monster (which, apparently, is all-too real) attacks the Coolsville Mall.

The special features are nothing special: an interactive map that takes you to places featured in episodes, animatics and an alternate opening.",1318723200,9,2084,4.748603351955308
2269127,2,B00097DY3Y,"Wow, this is the worse I have ever seen in video quality, it jumps and flicks and flops, it is unwatchable on a large television. I'm really unhappy that I paid $12 for something that makes me dizzy to watch with my son.",1318464000,3,220,4.1395348837209305
2269128,5,B00097DY3Y,"Def. worth buying a cheap used copy for the kids. I like watching this stuff too, even though it is not as good as the original Scooby Doo. A hipper version on the 60-70's classic, A Pup Named Scooby Doo, is still good and not as scary as the TV shows. very kid friendly.",1317340800,,271,4.037037037037037
2269129,3,B00097DY3Y,I'm confused with this show it is very weird. It is creepy to think that as kids(and puppies) we solved crimes while all the other children made lemonade and had fun. I give it 3 stars just out of love for Hannah Barbera's original characters,1307145600,,242,4.4
2269130,3,B00097DY3Y,"I'm sure all of the 'A Pup Named Scooby-Doo' dvds are not digital but we were disappointed when we found out it wasn't. My 2 1/2 year old son loves Scooby Doo and we bought these so we wouldn't have to watch 'What's New Scooby Doo' for the 100th time.  These are good cartoons but I recently saw it at Marshall's for $6, which is cheaper than what we got this for.",1301875200,,364,4.055555555555555
2269131,4,B00097DY3Y,I bought this for a friend but ended up watching it with my kids. It doesn't have much in the way of special features but my kids like the cartoons and its a great price on here for the complete series. The quality is very good for a dvd. Its something i watched as a kid and know its a lot more family oriented than a lot of the crap out there today. Overall it was a good buy.,1296950400,,378,3.7974683544303796
2269132,3,B00097DY3Y,"This was a great show I used to love watching back in the 90's. I am however a little upset with the video quality of this set. The backgrounds are fine but all the characters and moving animations in the front blur and then sharpen every second over and over and that blurriness and fuzziness to sharpness for a second and back gets really annoying. It makes it look like they ripped off AVI's and put them on here with crappy quality. Other than that major annoyance, its great to be able to see the show again.

I give it a 3 because of the bad video transfer.",1294099200,,563,4.212962962962963
2269133,4,B00097DY3Y,"I bought this for the 7 and 3 year-olds in my house. SCORE! I watched these shows when I was a bit younger and figured it would be an excellent gift for the youngsters. I was so right.

I'm actually afraid that we won't be able to watch anything else. The 3 y.o. watches the discs all day (even beating out his obsession with the original series TMNT DVD's), and his big sister watches them when she gets home from 2nd grade. I guess I'll be searching amazon for a good quality DVD player for their rooms.",1264032000,,505,4.206185567010309
2269134,3,B00097DY3Y,"I'm a big Scooby-Doo fan and, out of all the series based on the character, this has to be my least favorite. It's not that I didn't like it as it was entertaining, it's just the 'babyfication' of the show kinda made it less appealing to me. Most of the time, I'd figure out the mystery long before it ever got started. I imagine it was the producers' intentions to gear this more towards the younger set to  get them into Scooby Doo and, in that respect, they achieved what they set out to do. I just didn't care too much for it.

However, do I recommend this DVD set to everyone? Quite simply, yes. For what it is, it is a good show.  I agree, there are some areas of the DVD transfer that left the animation sketchy. It should be clearer than it is. But, overall, it's definitely worth recommending.

The best way to describe this show to you is simply this...A Pup Named Scooby-Doo is a re-imagining of the series inspired by the classic cartoons of Tex Avery and Bob Clampett, and even Looney Tunes. For the most part, it works. It was a success when it aired from 1988 to 1991 on ABC Saturday Mornings. I just wish it could've been more appealing to me, you know?",1263772800,4,1169,4.276018099547511
2269135,4,B00097DY3Y,"My four year old is Scooby Doo crazy but of all the Scooby DVD's we have, it's the Pup Named Scooby Doo that's the biggest hit.  He can watch it by himself as the regular Scooby titles can be slightly scary.  The stories are age appropriate and he just loves them.  There are ""bad guys"" that add conflict and there are still mysteries to solve but not scary monsters.  The mysteries are stories like who stole Fred's bike.  When he wants to watch it he asks, ""Can we watch the ones when Scooby Doo was a puppy?"".  He is glued to it.  I highly recommend for your younger Scooby Doo fan.",1255651200,,585,4.216216216216216
2269136,4,B00097DY3Y,"""A Pup Named Scooby Doo"" is a fun series that will appeal to classic Scooby fans as well as today's children.  The show is fast-paced, entertaining, somewhat educational, and a good ""prequel"" to the other Sooby Doo shows that follow the gang as young adults.

An interesting aspect of the series is that we can appreciate how much Daphine and Fred matured from the time they were in junior high to high school/college students.  The thoughtful, matter-of-fact Fred was once a boy who believed everything he read and jumped to silly conclusions.  Daphine was once a little rich girl who anything ""yucky"" if it was posh.

When the series aired in 1988 some fans groaned at the ""babification"" of their favorite characters.  However, it has aged well and remains entertaining.  The characters aren't ""babies"" and it's interesting to see them as kids.",1253232000,,846,4.915492957746479
2269137,4,B00097DY3Y,"My soon to be 2 year old boy likes watching this Scooby edition.  He fell in love with Scooby on a trip to Universal Studios and though this would be fun.  I also purchased the ""What's New Scooby"" version of Scooby but we have not watched that yet.

I won't even tell you how old I am though! Let's just say this...even my wife enjoys it! lol But this series is a really good lighthearted, humorous version of the Scooby we grew up with as kids.

I'm a little disappointed however.  There are some significant areas of the DVD transfer that left the animation sketchy.  It should be much much clearer than it is.  This isn't an issue with my TV or DVD player.  Some parts of the show just seem to look like they've been ripped from an AVI.

2269146,5,B00097DY3Y,"This version of Scooby and the gang is a series i watched on Saturday morning TV and i liked it. Shaggy would often serve as the narrator at the start of each episode, usually ending his monologue inserting the name of the series. For example: ""...things aren't usually what they seem to me and a pup named Scooby-Doo..."" and then that episode's story would begin. On hand for the show were Don Messick and Casey Kasem as the voices of Scooby and Shaggy respectively. I always got a kick out the running gag's on the show where Daphne would almost always call out for her butler in a time of crisis and sure enough, her butler would appear out of nowhere. Velma had few lines on the series...usually saying only her catchphrase of ""jinkies"". Her eye glasses were exaggerated. Fred was written more of a know it all who didn't really know it all...usually blaming high school bully Red Herring as the criminal in each mystery. The facial expressions were more along the lines of Tex Avery and Bob Clampette where one would see bulging eyes and tongues gyrating around and outrageous screams. The series ran on ABC-TV from 1988-1991 and re-ran on ABC mornings until around 1992/1993. It didn't have a long re-run life on the network. This DVD has a better packaging...when i opened the DVD i was happy to see the two DVD's on a what i call a flip-flapper. You don't have to pull a DVD out to get to another one, which is often the case in many DVD sets where DVD's over-lap one another. These DVD's are on these flappers much like in the THUNDERCATS collections. If you have those collections you'll know what i'm talking about. Anyway, each episode is crammed with visual gags and comedy...and it is also the last Scooby series to air on one of the big three networks. After this version left the airwaves in 1992/1993 there wouldn't be another new Scooby program in first-run production until 2002's WHAT's NEW, SCOOBY-DOO and that series was on the WB network, not one of the big three: ABC, CBS, NBC.",1206316800,11,2002,4.579387186629527
2269147,5,B00097DY3Y,"The new format followed the trend of the ""babyfication"" of older cartoon characters, reducing the original Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! cast to junior-high age. This new show also used the same basic formula as the original 1969 show: the gang (referred to in this show as the ""Scooby-Doo Detective Agency"") solved supernatural-based mysteries, where the villains (the ghosts and monsters) were always revealed as bad guys in masks and costumes. The biggest difference was the tone of the show: With A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, producer Tom Ruegger built upon the slightly irreverent humor he had established along with producer Mitch Schauer with Scooby's previous incarnation, The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo. This resulted in a wackier, more extremely comic version of Scooby-Doo that satirized the conventions of the show's previous incarnations. It was not uncommon for the characters to do wild Bob Clampett-esque takes when they ran into ghosts and monsters, Fred was constantly blaming a character appropriately called ""Red Herring"" for each and every crime on the show (true to his name, Red was always innocent, except for the one episode in which Fred didn't blame him) and shots of the characters (and even the ghosts and monsters) dancing were inserted into the obligatory rock-music-scored chase sequences. The ghosts and monsters themselves were also more comedic, such as a creature made out of molten cheese, and the ghost of a dogcatcher. Also in the series it features Scooby and Shaggy as their favourite superhero duo. Shaggy would be the fearless Commander Cool (a combination of Batman and Superman) and Scooby would be his faithful canine sidekick Mellow Mutt (a combinaton of Krypto, Robin (comics) and Ace the Bat-Hound.)",1204848000,7,1737,5.251798561151079
