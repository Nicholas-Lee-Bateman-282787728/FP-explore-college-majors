8056982,5,B000936NZE,"This 1998 edition of ED SULLIVAN'S ROCK-N-ROLL CLASSICS is two half-hour episodes of the syndicated best of Sullivan series. Jay Thomas narrates vintage film clip montages prior to each act.

Both shows feature Motown/Tamla/Gordy label stars. All segments are ""live."" The first Temptations tune is edited.

Besides having the poise and talent of a pro, Michael Jackson's hot fchsia felt hat shows that at age 11 he was already a sartorial marvel. After he and his brothers perform, Ed introduces their discoverer, Diana Ross. She acknowledges a cheering audience from her aisle seat.

During their meet-and-greet with the master of ceremonies, Four Tops lead singer Levi Stubbs tries without luck to teach Sullivan to boogaloo. Stevie Wonder wears the same bright blue jacket and tie for his 9/68 and 12/68 appearances.

Performances are ""live"" with these lip synched exceptions: ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head,"" ""We've Only Just Begun"" and ""Love Child.""

The first half features two show-stopping Jackson 5 turns and the last TV appearance of Diana Ross with the Supremes. In part two, Janis Joplin has a pair of songs. It's noted that although ""Raise Your Hand"" was a Janis concert favorite, she died before the vinyl version of it was released. The Pips are seen in this ""First Women"" segment in bright green Robin Hood outfits. One week after Dusty Springfield's soulful ""Preacher Man"" appeared on Sullivan's show, the single hit #1 nationwide. During a post-song meeting with Ed, he gets Dusty to reveal that her name is ""Mary Isobel Catherine Bernadette O'Brien.""
