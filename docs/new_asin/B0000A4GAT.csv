7995778,1,B0000A4GAT,"The film takes place in MIA and uses a lot of street language as the make the ice so they can get the paper or cheese. The movie looks like an HBO street documentary with poor camera angles and talking to people like ""Whypp"" ""Pyg"" ""Dog"" or ""Mooch."" But clearly it is not a real street film as the camera shows you both ends of a telephone conversation. The plot involves some home boys dealing drugs in the street, telling the guys that work for them they owe them for all the drugs no matter what happens. It feigns some politically commentary when it mentions the disparity of jail time for crack vs. cocaine.

There are drug deals gone bad, deals with Latinos and a ""cracker"" but no real plot, just a slice of life. No character build-up and minimal plot.

Written, directed, produced, music score by and starring Tony Mashino.

7995780,1,B0000A4GAT,"This work breaks the mode by not being located in NYC or LA.  It's in Miami.  I liked too how it didn't demonize voodoo, but instead called it ancestor worship.  But those are about all the good things.
I do understand Ebonics, as most of the intended audience would.  However, every character speaks slang in incredibly low voices.  I got tired of the invisible narrator/main character.  This takes bits from ""Menace II Society"" and ""New Jack City.""  Every woman is referred to by the B-word, in a terribly misogynist manner.  It took 15 minutes to introduce the main character's ""crew.""  This had close to no plot.
Only a person who loves any and all hood films would enjoy this.  There is extremely little redeeming about this work.",1293408000,,735,4.716535433070866
