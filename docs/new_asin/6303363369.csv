1. Care and Protection,""2. Not with Kindness,"" 3. Conclusions,""

I did and you will get the rest of the complete sets soon.
As Jack Frost (David Jason) has personal issues to solve he also solves the crime ellement for the movie
His usual problem is his boss's idea of only wanting good publicity and paper work done!

Another item I appreciate is his not smoking, ofcourse he eats a lot but this is great imagering.

 Jack seems to get it all done(including solving the crime!) by the end of the movie
and the Brit's know how to make good crime drama's

David Jason is a great actor and does not use bad language either
that is what I do not like about a lot of movies today
bad language shows the writers do not have a very good vocabulary.

By the time you get to set 14 the last set you will be able to start over on set 1 again
