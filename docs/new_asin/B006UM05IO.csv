8504601,5,B006UM05IO,"One of two of the best Toscas I've ever seen.  Performed at Genoa, Vissi d'Arte and E Lucevan di Stelle are sung twice according to the Italian custom of a repeat performance on sustained wild applause.  Both arias were deserving of a repeat, and both singers sand them a bit differently each time.  You'll not regret buying this DVD if you love Puccini.",1433116800,2,354,4.587301587301587
8504602,5,B006UM05IO,"After seeing Dessi and Armiliato's masterful performance in the Tutto Verdi Vespri, I was interested to see what other work she has done recently, and felt that this had been released. I am similarly impressed by their work on this Tosca.
They are both in great voice even if Armiliato succumbs to the temptation to and phrases in triple forte. He still has a beautiful voice, it's a shame he forces it like that, and when he's going for a fff he generally scrunches his nose up.
I have recently also watched the Callas/Gobbi '64 Covent Garden Tosca and in many places this production is very evocative of that, without copying details.
As much as I enjoyed Gobbi in that production, I enjoyed Sgura in this one. As did Gobbi, Sgura plays Scarpia as a fine Italian nobleman, very cunning and sure of himself, and also very deadly. With his voice alone he's very communicative, and he has every gesture and glance in synch while appearing natural. He has a fine voice, and he's still YOUNG! He's made a few recordings, i'm looking forward to many more, and from all these players.
Sound is fine, the camera angles are insightful.
This is from the Teatro San Carlo Felice, Genoa, 2010.
This blows the Gheoghiu/Covent Garden out of the water.
Dessi has plenty of voice to carry off this role and the panache to make it beleivable.
Armiliato has a voice more appropriate than Kaufmann, and he can control his coloration through vowel and volume changes.
Sgura is a classic Scarpia who is fascinating as a character, not played as a psycho, as Terfel does.
I hope you'll also consider seeing another excellent production which is on the Dynamic label, from the Festival Puccini.
While fully (and well) sung, the players focus on the action and each other; no one turns to the audience to sing.
The sets are drop dead gorgeous and the lighting is much closer to what you would find in a stage production rather than an opera. The Tosca allows herself to be dragged flat out partway across the stage holding on to Mario's leg as he's being taken to prison, and she actually wrestles with Scarpia before he picks her up and throws her onto the bed. It's very effective!",1410825600,4,2161,4.630208333333333
8504603,1,B006UM05IO,I was very surprised that Dessi was cast as Tosca - she is unsuitable for this role both vocally and dramatically. Her Vissi d'arte does not move one emotionally! And it's Vissi d'arte!!! It is a sad sign of the sorry state of the operatic world that we are being served shoddy work such as this performance. For a good Tosca I would recommend either Tebaldi or Gheorghiu.,1366761600,3,372,4.485294117647059
8504604,5,B006UM05IO,SINGING AND PRODUCTION ARE EXCELLENT.  TOSCA AND CAVARADOSSI SING NICE TOGETHER.  BARON SCARPIA IS ALSO EXCELLENT AND HIS CHARACTER AND VOICE FIT THE PART.,1357603200,,155,5.416666666666667
8504605,5,B006UM05IO,"First let's correct Amazon's error about the language.  This Tosca is sung in Italian, as we should expect, not Spanish.

Amazon/UK Users give this Blu-ray FIVE STARS.  Here's an excerpt from one of them:

The staging is traditional based upon Adolf Hohenstein's original design for the world premiere in Rome 1900. The costumes are based upon the Napoleonic period. Filmed live in 2010 at the Teatro Carlo Felice in Genoa. The orchestra of the Teatro Calo Felice is conducted at the right tempo by Marco Boemi and the stage director is Renzo Gacchieri. Daniela Dessi is Tosca, who sings with an unbridled passion, with her real life husband Fabio Armillato, an above average tenor who is Cavaradossi. Dessi gets to sing an encore of Vissi d' Arte and Armillato, E Lucevan Le Stelle,so good are they. This is a true Italian audience who know their opera. I have never come across two encores in the huge collection of DVD and Bluray operas I own. Scarpia is sung by lyrical Baritone Claudia Squra. Where has this man been. What a voice. He actually sings this part. A cunning Scarpia, the likes of which I have not seen. You have to hear it to believe it. The other parts are well taken.",1344384000,3,1187,4.6380952380952385
