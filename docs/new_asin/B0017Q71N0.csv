8430478,5,B0017Q71N0,"For any Marine, or family members of a Marine, or any military who know of Chesty Puller, they will enjoy this video- great photos
and footage as well as accounts from those who knew him firsthand. The only complaint is that it is not longer than 50 minutes.
Surely, as noteworthy as Chesty Puller's life was, the makers of this film could have included even more about him than they did.
Chesty Puller was a great man, husband, father, Marine and American.",1385510400,,457,4.585365853658536
