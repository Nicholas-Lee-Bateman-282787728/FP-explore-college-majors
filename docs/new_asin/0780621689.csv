I wish there were more acting opportunities in Texas. Hope is a wonderful movie that all baby boomers can relate with. Kudos to Goldie and Maureen for being lovely people to work with. The experience was one we will cherrish forever. Going to the premier in New York was icing on the cake!

This is a movie your whole family could benefit from watching

7789832,2,0780621689,"The movie itself was very good. The first 10 minutes of the video are messed up, so I do not know what happens during the first 10 minutes. I would not recomend buying a used video unless you get the chance to view it first to make sure it is ok.",1254960000,,246,3.843137254901961

7789834,5,0780621689,"Jena Malone's acting is pure poetry. Inspired by her dancing teacher's  faith in her, Hope clings to her dreams despite the awful circumstances of  her childhood. In the tradition of ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" her  pure honesty overcomes the bigotry of her surroundings. I sincerely hope  this film will be re-released, and acquire the critical acclaim and  popularity it so richly deserves",922665600,10,388,5.193548387096774
