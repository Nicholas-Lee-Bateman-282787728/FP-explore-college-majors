5092733,1,B007K7IC6K,"I can't understain why if they make a tv series in spanish mono, what is a reason to don't added in a dvd season, or subtitle.",1336694400,4,126,3.8846153846153846
5092734,5,B007K7IC6K,"TARZAN fans can rejoice. This memorable series is at long last now available on DVD, and they've done an outstanding job with this release. The quality is awesome,with bold colors, and superior, crisp definition. It looks so good in fact, that it's hard to believe what you're viewing is over 45 years old. Ron Ely's take on the character always impressed me as a kid, and revisiting these episodes now as an adult did not dissapoint. Each episode is really like a short movie, with unusually high production values for the period, and excellent performances from a stable of fine actors in guest roles, most notably former movie-Tarzan Jock Mahoney. Can't wait to get season two!",1335571200,15,680,4.870689655172414
5092735,5,B007K7IC6K,"An enjoyable series that aired some 46 years ago.  Ely became Tarzan when Mike Henry refused to do the tv series and does a terrific job.  A creature of its time, it is entertaining but it is odd to see white actors painted dark to be Africans when the series was shot in Mexico.  Lots of great guest stars: Jock Mahoney (himself an ex-Tarzan), James MacArthur (Danno on HAWAII FIVE-O), the Supremes as nuns and many others.  Though of us of the Boomer Generation a must have.  On Friday night at 7:30pm it was either TARZAN, THE GREEN HORNET or THE WILD, WILD WEST.",1333497600,5,566,4.403846153846154
5092736,5,B007K7IC6K,"Tarzan for its time 1966-1968 was a great action series with neat locations and sets and actors. Nichelle Nichols, Don Marshall,Diana Ross and the Supremes, Helen Hays,James MacArthur,Sally Kellerman,Ethel Merman,Nemiah Persoff,Lloyd Haynes,George Kennedy,Nancy Malone,James Earl Jones and many many more enliven this series with these great actors. Ron Ely was in excellent shape at the time to play this character for two seasons. Ron really took this role seriously and rarely used a stunt double. During the first season he sustained at least 17 separate injuries. He was bitten by a lion on the forehead and thigh on two different occasions. He singed his feet and legs running through fires, He ripped the skin off his feet sliding down a hill. While swinging on those vines they have broken at least three times falling 25 feet sustaining a separated shoulder,a broken shoulder, tons of cuts and bruises including both wrists and three ribs. Now thats really a trooper for and actor to really want to make the series believable. Ely is also famous for playing Doc Savage. For years the syndication prints have been horrible with really faded color prints, Update: Now that I have seen them they look remastered to me. You really can enjoy every episode like never before since they were made. The blues and greens are incredible and enhance the scenery. If you can't get one on amazon the WB archives sell it and part two as well to complete season one.",1332892800,39,1460,4.939024390243903
5092737,4,B007K7IC6K,I recently had the opportunity to watch a few episodes recorded from an old tv broadcast from eons ago and although the picture was awful I was pleasantly surprised and I got hooked! I certainly will be head the dvds when they are released. Revisiting this after nearly forty years I had come to snigger but this is a great tv programme everyone can enjoy. Ely had starred in aquanauts before this which I hope sees release before the enivitable demise of dvd which appears to be just round the corner. Wot a great way to spend a quiet afternoon at home..

5092745,5,B007K7IC6K,"I remember watching these Tarzan shows back in the 70s. They reran them on Saturday afternoons after all the cartoons and other live action shows went off. It was Fat Albert(last cartoon that came on Saturday mornings) The Saturday morning film festival, and Tarzan. Brings back memories. Not bad for a made on demand dvd.

5092751,5,B007K7IC6K,"I don't know why they broke the first season up into two volumes, but I love this show and recommend you pick up both seasons - including the 2 separate volumes of season 1.

When I was a kid my friends and I used to try and do that Tarzan scream as heard at the beginning of each episode.  Even back then it was hard to do.  Oddly enough, even though the scream was used at the start of each Ron Ely episode of the tv series, the actual ""aaaaaah-aaaah-aahhh"" scream was actually done by the movie Tarzan - Johnny Weissmuller and dubbed in later on.  Weissmuller is ikely the only person on earth to this day who could do that scream as his did.  Amazing lungs and vocal capacity.  Never fails to impress me.",1423612800,3,708,4.207407407407407

5092781,5,B007K7IC6K,Wow! One of the shows that bring back childhood memories for many people is this one! I remember this from when I was a kid and still enjoy watching it!

Wild animals at his control and natives as some of his friends leads to situations that you will find only in the wild!

5092801,1,B007K7IC6K,"Please Please people. This title along with Daktari are what's known as Media On Demand (MOD). The company is using the inferior DVDR format meaning they are 'Made To Order"" and are usually far less superior to proper DVDs. That means the shelf life of these titles will not last anywhere near as long. There may also be issues with the transfers to these inferior discs which may not show up straight away after you've purchased. Many people want to buy this but refuse because we want the company to issue it properly on the DVD standard format. Not these cheaper DVDR's. So I really urge you to join us and say NO! Look further down in the reviews here to see other negative opinions. No matter how much you want this title, don't give in. If you must by these inferior alternatives, then for gods sake, make a backup! Oh wait a minute, making a backup means purchasing blank discs causing you more expense and worry.",1351641600,14,920,4.514970059880239
5092812,5,B007K7IC6K,"I enjoyed this series as a child. It was closely related to the books of Tarzan.  He was found and educated, then decided to live in the jungle.  It has good messages.",1348876800,,167,4.1875
5092813,5,B007K7IC6K,"I recall as if it were only yesterday sitting in front of a small black and white television watching this tv series.  It is one of my favorites from my childhood. The scenery depicting the African jungle contributed to my fascination with the entire African continent which endures to this day.  My deep love for African wildlife was no doubt shaped by this show.  I didn't know at the time the profound effect the show would have upon me.

From what I have read, they have done an excellent job in presenting these episodes I assumed would be lost forever.  I am so glad to see them on the market finally.  I only wish it was available as a regular dvd, not a DVD-r format.  I believe that format will not hold up as long as a regular dvd.  Make a backup is all I can tell you.  Even in this format, I intend to buy, if they release both seasons.  I am just waiting for the price to be a much more attractive. I refuse to pay the full going rate for a show that is placed on inferior media.  That's what dvd-r is, inferior.

This set is no doubt like a time capsule from the second half of the 1960s.  It should be treasured for the work of art that it surely is.",1345852800,8,1165,4.124444444444444
5092814,4,B007K7IC6K,"It's been decades since I watched the Tarzan show as a teenager, and I always remembered the show as having the most faithful portrayal of Edgar Rice Burroughs' literary character.  Most big and little screen portrayals of Tarzan are so disappointing for fans of the original books, but Ron Ely's portrayal of Tarzan is satisfying and still the best and most authentic to this day.  Production values of the show were good for the time and the scripts, acting and directing and overall storytelling are generally good.  The audio/visual quality of the DVD's are quite decent.  I did have an issue twice with the audio and video being out of sync, but hitting the stop button followed by hitting play on the DVD player immediately resolved the problem.  These Tarzan show DVD's are a swingin' good time and I highly recommend them!",1344902400,4,830,4.816901408450704

The people that restored it did a great job. As a child, I was watching it in black and white on the French TV, because my parents couldn't afford a color TV. Another pleasure for a Frenchman like me is to be able to listen to Ron's true voice and I must say it suits very well his imposing height and adds to his charisma. Even my eight-year old daughter, that does not understand English wants to watch it. I'm requested to translate. Nothing more to say. It's just pure pleasure.",1339632000,3,634,4.24793388429752
5092817,5,B007K7IC6K,"Johnny Weismuller was the greatest Tarzan ever. But,Ron Ely made an excellent TV Tarzan. He was perfect for the part,was athletic and did most of his own stunts which usually ended up with him getting hurt. Up to that point,he was the 15th actor to assume the role, going all the way back to 1918. Gone was the ""Me Tarzan,you Jane"" dialogue,This was a well educated Tarzan. Gone was Jane as well. Manuel Padilla Jr played an orphan boy named Jai which Tarzan takes under his wing. I used to watch this as a child and am still happy to say that it is exactly the way I remembered it with plenty of action and adventure. There are plenty of guest stars here which includes
 Ruth Roman
 Jack Elam  Support your local Sheriff)
 Julie Harris (Knot's Landing)
 Maurice Evans (Bewitched)
 Ralph Meeker
 Henry Silva (Ocean's Eleven)
 Robert J Wilke (The Legend of Jesse James)
 James Earl Jones (voice of Darth Vader)
 Jock Mahoney (Yancey Derringer)
Coincidentally, Jock Mahoney played Tarzan in the movie,Tarzan goes to India. He appears three times here in season one as different characters. He was also the stepfather of actress Sally Field.
Manuel Padilla Jr, who plays Jai,  would appear in the final season of Sally Fields ""The Flying Nun"" TV series.
Good stories throughout this season with one episode playing out like an episode of ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" with hi-tech computers and villains in an underwater cavern. Another episode has Tarzan pitting his wits against a computer that can predict it's opponents next move.
It's a shame that Ron Ely did not do more TV work as he makes a great man of action as you will see in this series",1337644800,,1650,4.655172413793103

5092820,5,B007K7IC6K,"When I realized that the Tarzan tv series from the 1960s was finally available on dvd I ordered the two parts of Season One immediately. Ron Ely is the ultimate virile Tarzan and I can't imagine anyone more at ease in a loincloth. I think that the second season episodes are even better than the first so I can hardly wait for those ones to appear as well. On the plus side : Ron Ely is front and center for most episodes and the color is richer than I recall. The only negative is that the series is pretty useless as a lesson in Natural History and Geography because a single episode will mix together stock footage of fauna from South America ( jaguars, macaws, spider monkeys), Africa (lions, cheetahs, rhinos) and Asia (tigers, orangutans )and some episodes feature Africans and the next will have South American Indians. It would have been great too if extras had been included - an interview with Ron would have been a great addition.
