3444000,5,B0019UGYJQ,This is a classic Sylvester & Tweety cartppm/ That's why I ordered it. I love to revel in remembrance of my Saturday afternnoons at the movie where we saw two movies and lots of comics. Sylvester and Tweety were always my favorite. They're still up to their old tricks in this DVD set.,1353196800,,285,4.39622641509434
3444001,4,B0019UGYJQ,"Wow! does it bring back memories...
I love this Classic 2 DVD set... The complete first season of Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries. The quality of the audio and visuals are excellent. Worth every Penney and more... I highly recommend it...",1292025600,,237,4.95
3444002,5,B0019UGYJQ,I remembered watching this and it was a cute cartoon. Just wish they added more episodes to it.,1264464000,3,95,4.333333333333333
3444003,4,B0019UGYJQ,"If you thought that solving cases with a talking dog is strange, try solving them with a dog, a cat, AND a canary !  That's right; it's the the cat and birdy duo in their very own series: ""The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries"".

Join the lovable Tweety, that ""bad ol' puddy tat"" Sylvester, their canine companion Hector, and, of course, super-sleuth Granny as they scour the globe solving the most madcap mysteries you've ever seen in the first 13 episodes of the show.  Episodes include ""A Chip off the Old Castle"" (where the famed Blarney Stone goes missing), ""Bull Running on Empty"" (where the priceless Pamplona Periscope is purloined), ""The Maltese Canary"" (where Tweety is mistaken for an infamous item), and ""B-2 or Not B-2"" (where Granny solves a mystery on a cruise ship).

No matter how mysterious the case is, or how wacky the adventure gets, that Sylvester always keeps trying to get poor Tweety.  Luckily there's Hector the dog to stop Sylvester and Granny to quell the vicious cycle.  Looney Tune lovers and Kids' WB fans alike should get this impressive series.  (No mystery there !)",1240185600,13,1096,4.797872340425532
3444004,5,B0019UGYJQ,Great product. Purchased so I could show my grand kids what real cartoons are all about. Thay loved this DVD. Thank You.,1232323200,14,120,4.5
3444005,5,B0019UGYJQ,"My daughter is so happy this show is finally on DVD! She's been waiting YEARS for this! Sylvester and Tweety are her favorite Looney Tunes duo, and she loves Granny and Hector too! They'd better hurry up with the remaining seasons, as she's anxious to see all the episodes! She also says that they need to have some kind of bonus feature, like a behind-the-scenes featurette or something. Something where you can see the cast of the show and the people who worked on it behind the scenes and stuff. She digs those kinds of extras. Keep 'em coming, Warner Bros!!!!!",1230768000,8,564,4.594059405940594
3444006,5,B0019UGYJQ,"This was the last thoroughly decent series made during Warner Animation's storied Silver Age. Its DVD release is long overdue, and hopefully it will eventually include the second, third and fourth complete seasons as well. Not to mention the few episodes comprising the fifth. Everyone on earth deserves this colossal video treat. They will no longer have to attend movies in public.",1217462400,19,383,5.193548387096774
3444007,2,B0019UGYJQ,"Bought a copy of SYLVESTER AND FRIENDS Volume 1, only to find it contained disc #1 of THE SYLVESTER AND TWEETY MYSTERIES Season 1 inside.  (The Sylverster & Tweety Mysteries is a 2-disc set.)  Returned it, only to have the same problem.  Returned again, only to get the same wrong disc inside yet again!  Foolishly optimistic, tried one more time and history repeated itself once more.  Since then, I've heard the same story from every person who's purchased this.  (The one exception being someone who got the second disc from The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries.  Apparently that disc's contents match what's supposed to be in SYLVESTER AND FRIENDS.)  You have to wonder what goes on over at Warner Bros.",1461024000,3,703,4.848739495798319
3444008,2,B0019UGYJQ,"Well, here's the problem with this DVD:  Though the package is labeled as ""Sylvester and Friends, Volume 1"", the the disc inside is for ""The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries: The First Complete Season, Disc 2"".  The contents on the package and on the disc are the same!  Episodes 9-13 of the Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries.  We bought 10 copies for our library system through a vendor, who also sells ""The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries, 1st Complete Season"" - 2 discs. Because of the title difference, we did not realize that we could have gotten both discs had we ordered the Mysteries title instead of Sylvester and Friends.  And, just to make matters more frustrating, Disc 1 of the Mysteries is not sold separately.
This is not the first time Warner Brothers has repackaged a set with weird results.  I am hoping the vendor will take back Sylvester and Friends Vol. 1 so we can purchase The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries.  What a mess!",1458777600,5,939,4.723926380368098

3444026,2,B0019UGYJQ,"my granddaughter and I LOVE the old Tweety and Sylvester shows. But this group was just awful. The music was overdone and annoying, the storyline was boring and there was no cuteness in the characters. What makes the older bugs bunny cartoons so wonderful was their ability to mix the tender and the harsh. Even though Sylvester was always trying to eat the cute little birdy, you still loved Sylvester because there was an innocence and a sweetness to him that is definitely lacking in the new updates. Granny was gruesome, not hilarious. Pass this one up.",1397433600,,557,4.752577319587629
