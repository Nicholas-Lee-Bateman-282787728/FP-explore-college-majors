8706433,4,B00UGQFAEY,"Regarding the 1952 film ""Invasion USA"" by Hollywood director Alfred E. Green:

The book ""Science Fiction in the Cinema"" (1970) by John Baxter has the following interesting passage about the plot of this 1952 science fiction film.  John Baxter wrote:  [The 1952 film opens] . . . . ""in a New York bar with a group of drinkers discussing the Cold War  [...] and a possible Russian invasion beginning with a mass atomic attack.  As the group disperses its members die one by one in the war, either killed by the enemy or wiped out in the disasters they cause, LIKE THE DESTRUCTION OF BOULDER DAM.  As the last member is killed, falling in a screaming descent  FROM THE TOP OF A SKYSCRAPER......""

Did this  movie predict the fall of the man who was shown on TV news allegedly leaping  from the flames of one of the Twin Towers on 11 Sep 2001?  The man head first with one leg crossed at an angle over the calf of the other leg (masonic Hanged Man pose).

Is there a disaster involving Boulder Dam in the works?  Was this movie an example of predictive programming?  Time will tell.",1500076800,,1078,4.433673469387755
