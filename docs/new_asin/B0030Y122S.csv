4047375,5,B0030Y122S,"this is probably the most intelligent psyche thriller I've seen in years. Caught it at the sacramento film festival. Creates it's own sick and perverted world that
tests the viewer's own judgement and discernment. Either way it is demented beyond belief and very very creatively imagined and fleshed out.",1265932800,14,304,5.224489795918367

8386257,3,B0030Y122S,"Most of us know Robert Picardo from his Star Trek and Stargate roles, but this is definitely something different. I appreciate and understand an actor taking roles to stretch his reputation, and am hoping that this was the case here. It was physically uncomfortable to me to watch this movie, and I didn't particularly enjoy seeing an actor, as I've known him, in a dark role such as this. Realistically, if this were from a less-appreciated name, I'd have dropped the movie 15 minutes in. Long story short, the movie is dark, twisted, and makes you want to question the background of a writer whose psyche produces it. Though I can understand why Mr. Picardo might make a film such as this, frankly, I'm hoping that he didn't enjoy doing so. ... Definitely not a relaxing film to watch.",1364169600,,787,4.669064748201439
8386258,1,B0030Y122S,"the stupidest film ive seen in a long time,wish I could get refunded  to watch something worth my money, made no sense",1356739200,,118,4.363636363636363
8386259,2,B0030Y122S,"One word- boring!! I did not care about the character, his motivations, nor the victims because this movie was just too boring to get through.  I have patience with movies and I love a movie that builds tension and anticipation but the only thing this movie did was put me to sleep!!!  I have watched most horror movies made at this point and I'm not just saying this, I'm warning you- I found this movie to be really boring!!",1349136000,,426,4.379746835443038
8386260,3,B0030Y122S,It was dark and at least original in its theme and story. But didn't pack much of punch in the suspense department and I didn't find particularly scary because of that.,1348444800,,168,4.451612903225806
8386261,4,B0030Y122S,I don't want to spoil the movie so I will keep this brief.  I was nervous about renting as it has no trailer but I am so glad we did.  This movie will have you guessing until the end. It is not something I have seen done before.  Not so gruesome but very stimulating for the mind.  My husband and I both enjoyed this film.,1344643200,3,322,3.9076923076923076
8386262,3,B0030Y122S,love robert picardo and i did like the film. it is  very violent and scary at the start but that doesnt last so if you get through that part the rest is just weird and confusing. he is a good actor though,1320192000,,204,3.857142857142857
8386263,4,B0030Y122S,"Sensored is a cult classic in the making.  At times simple, at times complex; it will leave you guessing right up to the end.  Unlike most movies in this genre, you can watch it several times and still be surprised at what you uncover - it is anything but formulaic.  If you're looking for a movie that captivates you from the start and has you both amused and confused, this is your movie. You'll appreciate the complexity of the story and the fact that it's not just another ""run-of-the-mill"" pshyco-drama.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!!!",1274140800,3,544,4.6947368421052635
