8039287,5,B00066N9Y2,"There is great difficulty in finding high quality, genuine Muay Thai teaching. This 4-DVD set is a gem. I have met Janjira this year at a Coaching seminar, so buying this set was a ""no-brainer"".
Good quality visuals, and audio, he takes you through the simple basics to an intermediate level.
I appreciated both the front-on views, and the side views, and the drills using a long tape on the mat.
I will treasure this instructional video.",1378512000,,438,4.701298701298701
8039288,3,B00066N9Y2,"The content of the dvd`s are woth it for someone completely new just a couple of tips are good for someone with experience in this art already but i did feel more confident with my muay thai since a great trainer like this is showing stuff i did know al ready ,muay thai is not that technical like wing chung so there is not really that much to say about it just practice hard the dvd`s are ok but the quality of the discs are very low are not from a dvd`s manufacturer with finished polish these are just copies from a master and get scratched really easy due to the lack of a professional finish mine came all scratched but i didn't bother to return them because as i said the content is very easy and i don't think im going to watch them over and over .",1324857600,,756,4.080536912751678
8039289,5,B00066N9Y2,"Master Saekson DVDs are the best that you can get. very thorough and excellent for the beginner as well as the advanced.
as he teaches us more he keeps going back to the basic stance that he taught at the beginning because it is the basic foundation for Muay Thai. He shows different angles and goes over each technique several times so you can actually learn.
i highly recommend these to anyone and everyone. also if you connect with him on myspace and facebook you can ask Saekson/Saekson's gym people questions if you need to. ive only had to ask one since i started about a year ago.",1282780800,,587,4.444444444444445
8039290,5,B00066N9Y2,"I had been training muay thai for a good while before getting these, and wanted to get a fresh look from a different perspective.  I found it refreshing to see such a good pedagogical model in place.  Saekson is a top notch teacher and has tons of experience, you will never regret getting these DVDs.",1279929600,3,301,4.454545454545454
8039291,4,B00066N9Y2,This DVD although the quality is not picture perfect the information is accurate and detailed. If you continue to drill one step at a time even the most inexperienced person can good understanding on defense and offense. Definetly worth the price. Don't think about it.,1185235200,10,269,5.0
8039292,5,B00066N9Y2,"This is a great DVD set for begenning Muay Thai.  The first DVD walks you through the basics of punches, including jab drills, jab cross drills, Hook drills, punching drills with weights (so when you take the weight off your super fast and powerful).

The second DVD moves on to to upercut drills, kicking and elbow drills.  Note that these drills are VERY well laid out showing proper footwork, proper punching/kicking techniques, proper punch/kick technique.

DVD 3,4 are advanced drills with bags and partners great for the next level after core training.  Anyone interested in my original copy can let me now at [...] as I have recorded the series on my tivo.",1168300800,9,663,4.831858407079646
8039293,5,B00066N9Y2,"This Is Bye Far The Best Muay Thai Video Out there thus Far

Master Saekson Breaks everything down to the Bar basics to advanced teckniqes.  If you need Reference material to expand your nolege in Muay Thai this is it. Its worth every pennsy",1154822400,,241,4.454545454545454
8039294,5,B00066N9Y2,"If you want to learn Muay Thai I highly recommend you to buy at least DVD 1 & 2 from this collection.

Excellent sound & picture quality .  Very easy to understand Master Saekson and also good side angle shots to clarify points.  DVD 1 & 2 are excellent for the beginner and you could easily ""work in"" with them to get you started and get your routine up and running.

DVD 3 & 4 give general training/conditioning tips and would probably suit someone who is going to put alot of time in and become a serious fighter or once you have been training for sometime and want to explore the system and conditioning aspects further (However, very useful if you have not trained before and have no idea how to work bag/pads or put combinations together or just have a lack of imagination).

However, still a bargain for all 4 and the delivery was about 2 weeks before target.

I have been training in martial arts for 15 years (Karate, Dim-Mak and boxing) and recently became interested in Muay Thai (this is down to the fact that it is a proven fighting system, see NHB and UFC for good examples of real world aplication and you can now get good instruction/information).  I have a couple of the 4 and 5 star rated books from Amazon and various other sites on the subject and as I have a good understanding of various MMA's train at home - whilst the books are very good, being able to see the full range of movements in the DVD's goes way beyond what the books can do.  DVD's 1 & 2 are excellent for this - all the basic's are made very clear along with the slightly different techniques used in Muay Thai - explaining how the skinny guys get so much power into their punches and kicks!!!(lol).

I highly recommend these DVD's and The Underground Guide to Warrior Fitness by Ross Enamait (for Strength and Conditioning tutorial) and a good back up wrestling or Brazilian Jiu-JitSu DVD i.e Gracie Brothers release.  You would then have a ""real world "" fighting system and full knowledge on how to train/strengthen your body without buying expensive gadgets/weights or cardio equipment etc.",1140480000,37,2081,4.525333333333333
