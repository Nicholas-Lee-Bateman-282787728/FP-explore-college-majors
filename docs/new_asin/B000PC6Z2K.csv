8190456,5,B000PC6Z2K,"I was shock when my friend said he picked this up as I never knew there was a second season of 13 episodes for Space Pirate Mito.  This was a great.  Picking up where the original Space Pirate Mito left off Aoi is now the queen of the universe while still trying to live as normal a life as she can since her gender change at the end of last season. Aoi is still in love with her bodyguard Mutsuki who is having trouble balancing her feeling for Aoi with her duty as body guard. When The First Queen of the royal family return from the dead to take the crown away from Aoi its up to Galaxy Police and Pirates to team up against the ultimate unstoppable menace.  Its not easy being a queen trying to balance her royal duties, school work and protecting the galaxy from an unspeakable evil. Especially with type of loyal but wacky class mates Aoi goes to school with.",1328659200,,865,4.2303030303030305
8190457,5,B000PC6Z2K,"I can tell you one thing, I was VERY glad when this came out. I was wondering if I was ever going to see the end. Even though it is in sub format only, this 2nd season was still very fun to watch. For one thing I must say I adore the new antonginist Hikari. She is wicked and very cool looking and kicks butt at all the same time. The character depth is great esp. for Mutsuki, who wonders if her love for Aoi is true. The only thing I was disapponted on was the OP. animation, for it was kind of crummy compared to the first season (the song rocks though). And yes, there are still plenty of weird aliens to look forward to. So have fun time watching!",1215561600,,652,3.984732824427481
