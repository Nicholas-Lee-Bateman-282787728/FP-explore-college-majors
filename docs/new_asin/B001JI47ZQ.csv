The individual releases of Cowboy Bebop and GiTS's first DVD are good comparisons; image is just as dirty as the former but not as sharp as the latter. Picture quality is, well.... at times it's pristine, other times not so much. Although I think its' color palette makes it appear dirtier than what actually is. Meaning that, while colorful, it doesn't contain as many DIFFERENT colors as say Princess Mononoke or the Rurouni Kenshin OVA's. And like GiTS, it's color palette doesn't really expand once the concert starts. Granted, one is completely fictitious while the other a live concert, but still; you get my point. Video is completely and utterly uncompressed, but not a PERFECT image... sometimes, depends on the song really. Perfect balance of video noise and film grain too. Audio is PCM, so no need to expand on that, and video is interlaced so watch it accordingly.

Disc and sleeve are as colorful and detailed as you'd expect a R2 DVD to be. As for the concerts, they're amazing, especially the first. Every performance for Lostman is incredible, with special mention to Sleepy Head's. (Though special mention could be given to all 25 songs really) And I mean it; EVERY. SINGLE. SONG. Something has to be said regarding their energy and Sawao Yamanaka showmanship as a front man. This is rock and roll at it's finest, and only a complete miserable prick devoid of any emotion could watch uninspired. There are songs I could've done without however. Daydream Wonder, Cherry, Non Fiction, Rush; pass. Skeleton Liar, Beautiful Picture and Beautiful Morning With You; if only. The Piped Piper concert is great too. Actually, no. Scratch that. At first I didn't really appreciate it but Jesus Christ; New Animal, Poison Rock n Roll, All the way to the edge of this world. You will be on your feet. And just like Lostman, all but one performance (Maybe two, depending on how you feel) is a testament to the Pillows ability putting on a live show. The only negative I can think of is Midnight Down and Funny Bunny. Midnight's is rather unenthusiastic, which is kind of a let down considering it's one of their greatest songs (I think all if not most pillows fans would agree with that sentiment). Funny Bunny's is ehhh... I don't know. I think Don't Forget Today's is infinitely better. With that being said, this DVD is a gem and worth every penny.",1507939200,,2427,4.79236276849642
